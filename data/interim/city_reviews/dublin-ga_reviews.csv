Perfect pit stop for us, we have two kids and they loved running around the huge back yard, the kitchen and living room were nice and open so we could all hang out together. We ended up getting to the house very late and they were great about communication. Highly recommend!"

We were visiting family in Dublin and our stay here added to the great weekend.!! I just wish we could've stayed longer. If you are traveling and need a place to stay in the area I'd highly recommend staying here. I wish I could've stayed and had more time to stay and chat with David. Truly exceptional!!!

Stayed one night","The reason I choose David's place is because it was off the beaten path but don't let that fool anyone, it is a diamond in rural GA. Very nice decor, comfy bed and quiet. It has all you need to cook and enjoy yourself away from the city/town. We even showed up two hours earlier than expected but that was fine. You can only image how difficult it is to travel on Mother's Day and if I had known how well appointed it was, I would have gone to the store and cooked my wife dinner. But Longhorn was only 16 min away and they cooked a great dinner and we took it to our place and ate there. No cheap paper plates here. Like I said earlier, had all of the necessities. I would gladly stay here again! Thanks David."

Stayed with a pet","Me and two friends on a road trip, headed south from the mountains, found David's place because he accepts pets, and we had a dog along with us in our RV. We just wanted a night outside of the RV, so we chose David's place based on his allowing pets, and because his place sits in beautiful, wooded, natural surroundings. We got to extend our camping trip by staying at his place, and we had all the amenities of home. We played games, had coffee on the veranda, took a walk, slept well, and enjoyed all of David's fine craftsmanship in this beautifully designed guest house. He and his wife have thought of everything, so we all adored their décor, design and comfortable space. The sun rises through the woods behind the house, so it's a perfect spot for morning and evening peacefulness. I will definitely return for some more quiet time along the way to the Carolinas! I/We Highly recommend this spot, off the beaten path, just as lovely as the photos!"

Stayed one night","OMG where do I begin? I've stayed at a lot of AirBnB's all over the country and beyond. This is probably one of the nicest, if not the nicest place I've stayed. The fact that David and his wife actually did most of the work on this place themselves is incredible. Just everything about it.... the decor, the yard, fire pit, coffee selection and of course, David himself is such a pleasure. My mom and I thoroughly enjoyed meeting David and hearing all about his life and how the AirBnB came to be. Unfortunately, we were only passing through so we did not get a chance to explore the surroundings or get to use the fire pit, but if I ever have the chance, I'd come back here for a little vacation. Highly recommend!! Wish we got to meet David's wife."

Stayed a few nights","I cannot express strongly enough how peaceful and comfortable David's Airbnb is. I did not choose the Airbnb because of the area, I chose it because I just wanted a relaxing place to go that looked clean and restful, in a natural setting. In no way was I disappointed by David's location or apartment. The setting is very peaceful. There’s a nice patio you can sit outside and enjoy the wooded view or if it’s cold and you sit inside, you can still have a peaceful treetop, sky view sitting on the couch and looking out.
David was very thorough with his move-in information and pointing out how to connect to Wi-Fi , as well as use the TV, etc. He’s very attentive while still giving privacy during your stay. I specifically appreciated his prompt, clear responses.
I highly recommend David‘s place if you’re looking for a peaceful place to stay surrounded by nature, without having to drive deep into the woods to a remote location."

One highlight of their place is being able to watch cows outside the kitchen window in the mornings. We will definitely be back.

We had an issue with the AC but then Tiger came and fixed it as soon as he could and we had our AC back!!
Overall worth the stay, definitely a diamond in the ruff if you’re looking to stay in the area 😊"

Stayed with kids","We were in the Eastman area for a wedding. Most hotels were 30+ minutes away, so we decided to go the AirBNB route. Boy are we glad we did! Tiger and Christina were the best hosts. They immediately responded to all messages leading up to our stay. Upon arrival, they were there to greet us and show us through the property. The property is not only as described in their listing, but it definitely exceeded expectations. Clean and well appointed. They had coffee and it’s supplies for us, bottles of water and a few soft drinks, chips, and best of all - a dozen fresh eggs straight from the chicken coop located there in the back yard (my omelette was wonderful). After our return from the wedding on Saturday night, I put the fire pit to use (it was ready to go, with cardboard and wood stacked for easy lighting). If ever in the area again, I will stay here. Highly recommend!!!!! Thanks Tiger and Christina for all of your help. It was great meeting you."

The house is cozy and we love sitting around the fire pit and cooking in the outdoor kitchen. We also love watching the farm animals. The host made us feel like family and did everything they could to make our tip amazing. They were very respectful of privacy but readily available and easy to reach. I can’t say enough.

The guest house checks off all the boxes if you are anything like me and would rather have a unique experience over another hotel stay. This Airbnb is specifically great if you are working in Dublin or on your way to Macon or Atlanta from Florida.
Jay and Christina are great hosts. They absolutely respect your privacy if you just need space, but also are very hospitable and welcoming, offering to chat over a fire with s’mores as you wind down your day.
The country skyline from their place is phenomenal. It was also fun to catch a couple of catfish in their pond. Jay even lended me his fishing pole.
You can definitely see the labor of love that was put into this guest house. Could not say greater things about their place or this host! This is coming from someone that travels for a living.
Cheers to you Jay and Christina- to many more guests to share in this new chapter of your life! Well done!

Being able to walk the back field with the dog was nice and relaxing. We eill be back. It was onlt 15 min from my brothers house.

She’s extremely friendly and goes out of her way to make the guest and their pet feels so welcome and appreciated. My dog really liked the treats that she left for him as did I and absolutely delicious banana nut muffins beautiful space can’t say enough good about this Airbnb. Can’t wait to stay again.!

Stayed with kids","This was the best Airbnb stay I've ever had and Gina was the best host ever! The house was spotlessly clean and comfortable. The property was quiet and peaceful. Gina was so welcoming - it felt even better than staying with family! She had so many thoughtful and kind touches - the refrigerator was stocked with all the basics and snacks were provided in a basket on the kitchen table. There were even cupcakes from a local bakery waiting for us! Her handwritten notes and small treats were amazing and made us feel special. We stayed over Easter weekend and there was Easter candy for my children. They were thrilled! She was easy to communicate with and quick to respond.
We didn't get a chance to explore all the acreage of the property but it was so beautiful and peaceful. We saw deer grazing in the field on a couple of mornings. We will make time to walk the property next time we stay because we will definitely be back. Highly recommend! You won't regret it."

A wonderful place to unwind and decompress in a peaceful country setting. There was plenty of space to spread out both in the cottage and in the spacious outside space. The cottage was adorable and even more spacious than the photos showed. It lacked nothing and was so clean and well appointed.. Gina’s hospitality was over the top wonderful and a highlight was when she visited with goodies in hand and gave my pups some extra love and attention. I would highly recommend and will definitely be back any time I am back in the area. You will not be disappointed.

Stayed one night","Janelle’s Cottage was so cute and roomy enough for my friend and I that was attending Peaches to the Beaches Yard Sale. The cottage was beautifully decorated, the beds extra comfy, clean and spacious. We so enjoyed meeting Gina upon arrival. She provided the best snacks and even a pizza for dinner which we were so appreciative of since we had been in the yard sale trail all day snd weren’t up to going up for supper. She even had the coffee ready for our first cup the next day. All we had to do was plug in the pot.
Of all the hostess I have encountered in my years of staying in AirBNB’s Gina is TOPS! She is the sweetest lady who thinks of others and their comfort and prays for each guest for safe travels. She is an amazing woman.
We will definitely stay there again and will recommend the cottage to others. I give Janelle’s Cottage and a Gina a pen A+++++."

Gina thinks of so many thoughtful details, and I’ve never been in such a lovingly stocked Airbnb. After two long days on the road, walking into the cottage felt like a gift. It was a wonderful last overnight on my way home; I left feeling rested and rejuvenated.
The property is beautiful and peaceful. My dogs were comfortable in the house, and *loved* exploring the property and discovering many new nature smells. And they loved the chicken jerky that was there for them!"

Stayed with a pet","My roots are southern, but I was raised in the north ~ Gina and I hit it off via messages sent through the app. Though I had an 11 hour drive to get to the cottage, and there was no way that I was not going to arrive early enough so as to meet her. A warm hug, dinner in the fridge (the most delicious chicken & dumplings), a sweet treat, and a handheld breakfast for the next day all were a true example of southern hospitality. The cottage is divine ~ the house was immaculate and homey ~ equipped with EVERYTHING that one might need (in case you forgot something). The bed was comfy (as was the pull-out sofa), the coffee pot all ready to go, and if I hadn’t been so tired, I would have taken a walk ~ the area is that safe.
I have 30 AirBnb stays yo my credit (some repeats), and Gina & Gene’s place now has a rank of #1 as far as favorite stays and favorite hosts.
Be sure to visit Janelle’s Cottage ~ you will fall in love."

They did everything they could to make me feel welcome. Provided treats and snacks, filled the fridge, and even gave me a personalized painting as a goodbye gift.
You will have everything you need at this place. If you need anything else, just ask. Gina and Gene will make sure you are cared for. They also give great food and event recommendations.
Gene even put up a bench at a clearing on the trails so I could sit and soak in nature after a long day of work at the computer. I loved being close to the trails and being able to walk them.
It was a pleasure to stay at this lovely cottage. If I am ever back in Georgia, I will make sure to come back there. Gina and Gene truly go above and beyond, creating a beautiful second home for their guests."

Special snacks for me as a healthy eater, special organic dehydrated chicken breast for my raw fed dog and fresh peppermint and chocolate mint for my tea! The cottage was as listed. Very clean and had everything we needed. Felt at home as soon as I drove up with great lighting and the porch light on (I arrived later than expected and in the dark) . The property was amazing and the mowed down trails were an extra special treat for us. We did 1 of the appropriate 3.5miles available on their property. Had time constraints and needed to get to our next destination. Gina and Gene are great people. Definitely on my “come back” list!"

During our stay, Gina dropped off a pan of homemade cinnamon rolls. Wow! We stayed for work, but we felt right at home. Bringing our dog never felt like an inconvenience either.

Stayed with a pet","This was a GREAT place & wheelchair accessible. There are 4 spacious rooms/areas. The living room: I loved the rocker and homemade throw (crocheted on one side and sherpa on the other side), all sofas/chairs were COMFIE. The kitchen/dinette had chairs for 3, with gel insets for long sitting. It was WELL stocked. I was able to make an eggs/bacon/English muffin breakfast before getting on the road. Checkout time is noon! The bedroom has a piano, bed, and closet with large outward swinging doors. The bathroom had large entry doors, the shower was a square shape with a dropdown seat, shower rails, & nozzles that detached.
We had our dog with us. This place was his perfect vacation spot, which made us happy. Gina had made homemade treats that Bruce LOVED. The open farmland behind the house let him RUN freely and for long distances. He once turned to face us with an expression of ""is this real""? ""May I"" before galloping off.
Location is easy off the NSroute bypassing Atlanta."

Stayed with kids","Would NOT recommend this house; would never stay here again. I came for a funeral and picked a house instead of a hotel so we could have a kitchen and the prices were comparable. The kitchen didn’t even have any salt or pepper but it was supposed to be ready for cooking. The fridge had broken shelves and made loud noises from time to time. The bathtub had dead bugs in it when we arrived. There was dust hanging from the walls in every corner and on the lamps. Master bed was sleep number that did not work and kept sliding off the foundation. There were cable wires sticking out of the floors and walls in most of the rooms. Twin beds headboards were not attached to anything, they were only held in place with the mattress. The carpet looked like it had not been vacuumed recently. Sink in the master bathroom was broken. Chair swing on the porch that was in the pictures was broken. Requested refund for $195 cleaning fee, owner argued despite pictures. Not a welcoming house."

The house is cozy and well-decorated, with a fully equipped kitchen and a charming fireplace. However, the WiFi is unreliable, so it's not ideal for those needing a consistent internet connection. Overall, it's a great place to disconnect and enjoy nature."

Other than that, and the fact that the driveway was the worst driveway I’ve ever driven on, it was a fine place to stay."

Group trip","We loved staying at the Falcons Nest! Overall a very clean house: Spotless kitchen, great bathrooms and an amazing loft upstairs. Everything we needed was right in the house from cooking and cleaning supplies to reels and rods to fish down by the dock. Extremely secluded feeling and an amazing place to book if you need a little R&R with some friends and family. Briceton was very accommodating as we had an Airbnb fall through less that 24 before we were supposed to be there so I found this one and could not have been happier. Briceton answered all the questions I had regarding amenities and the check in process. I could not have asked for a better host. If you are looking to go off the grid for a few days this is the place to book. There’s so much to do: fishing off the dock or the kayak, playing corn hole, or even just sitting and swinging on the deck. Thank you for this amazing gem Briceton and we can’t wait to hopefully be back again!"

Definitely would advise an SUV or truck for getting in and out of the property as the drive down is a bit rough but other than that, this place is home away from home. The property is a fisherman's dream and not a better place to wake up with a cup of coffee than the wrap around porch. We had a wonderful time and look forward to returning again soon. Thanks again.

My son especially liked fishing, we caught a lot of decent size bass which we released back into the lake, the fire pit was perfect for the weather since it got down into the 50s at night. My favorite thing was sitting on the porch swing and watching the leaves fall from the trees while sipping my coffee in the late mornings. Briceton was a quick message away anytime I had a question and he was an amazing host! We will definitely be back!"

The room is super private, has its own entrance, and you can’t hear noise from the rest of the house. The room was super clean and stocked with everything you could need. The shower was also amazing. 10/10 would recommend staying here!"

Then on a whim, I decided to look and it was available. It was an absolute dream being able to make one left turn out the driveway and ta-da I was at my client's office! Not to mention it is very walkable to downtown Sandersville. The house is so perfect but the part I LOVE the most...I'm recycling money into a community that I LOVE and not into a corporate motel or hotel. So now I'm strategically planning my trips each month around the Pink House's availability. #ThanksKaren"

Plenty of space, very cozy and welcoming. The decor was so nice. It was homey. Super clean and inviting. We only stayed one night. If you get a chance to look at the book they have there of the restoration, look through it. It was amazing! I'm a sucker for a good restoration of a house. The bed was comfy, several of our guests didn't come so we had plenty of room. It rained from when we checked in at 6 until checkout but we would have loved to sit outside and enjoy the fire pit.

Stayed with a pet","We enjoyed our stay and the home was tastefully decorated for the Christmas season. The fenced in area in the front yard was nice for my dogs. It is located close to stores and places to eat but it is on a busy road. The driveway is a little small as we were driving a large pickup but it was manageable. I am sorry to say but we thought the bed in the main bedroom was terribly hard. Felt like we were sleeping on the floor.
There is also a lack of space to put personal belongings if you are staying for more than a night. A dresser in the bedroom would be nicer than a decorated cabinet. Also would be nice to have 2 nightstands instead of just one for things like charging your phone at night. Other than that it is a cute tiny home with a great county feel."

It had difficulty getting in touch with the host at 10:30 at night when we arrived. Other than the check in the place was adorable and clean and we enjoyed our stay."

Stayed a few nights","Although I had read all of the other rave reviews, I was not prepared for how over the top the Pink House is in person! Arrived at sundown and the lights were on - inside and out. The house is located within walking distance of the town square which is darling, too. There is a fire pit with Adirondack chairs out back and the yard itself looks like a postcard - cute party lights, pea gravel walkway, cute decor. The inside is just picture perfect and so comfortable. There are two bedrooms with their own mini split AC and thermostat. The linens in the bathrooms are lush and not skimpy. I slept in the main big bedroom and the mattress was so comfortable. My stay was only two nights and wish it were longer - it was like a mini vacation. The hostesses were very communicative and helpful. I had business in Warthen and this house was only 13 min from there. Stay at the Pink House if you have any excuse to be in the area!"

It was wayyyyy more spacious than a hotel room &perfect for what we needed it for...so it was definitely worth it. Also was a plus that they already had pans available, cleaning supplies, wood, & sticks for roasting smores(kids want to come bk just for that). Also, the Wi-Fi was good enough for our phones to be on, our Playstation (no lagging while playing games), & my work laptop (when I needed it the morning of checkout). Thanks for letting us stay at the Lil pink house & baby boy enjoyed his bday sleepover."

Stayed with a pet","My husband and I have ranked the little Pink House as the best Air B&B ever! Each morning and evening, we walked our pup to the town square, through old colonial homes, and back up the street to the little Pink House. The circle was right at a mile. The neighbors were so friendly. In the town square, there is Mexican food, Pickle Barrell Pub, and a little park where you can play a life-size game of chess! I am a pescatarian and had options at both places. The house is everything a wonderful farmhouse should be with modern updates! The internet is fast and strong. I was able to work remotely without glitches or delays using Microsoft Teams meetings and WebEx. The pup loved the front yard, and the fence gave me peace of mind because he was safe. The little Pink House was perfect, and I didn't want to leave!"

Only caveat for future guests is to realize that it’s a small house—the second bedroom is tiny and a small two-person kitchen table is the only workspace. The gazebo in the yard and having two full baths were both a big plus. We were in Sandersville visiting family and would definitely stay at Karen’s again."

Kitchen was well appointed, everything we needed - the old farm sink with the scars from another lifetime was a fantastic touch!
If I ever find an old house to renovate I’ll certainly be using some of the things I saw here.

There were a few games that the kids enjoyed, all the cooking items we needed, plenty of bedding, nice fairly new bathsheets/towels and the beds were comfortable and clean.
We did notice a typical cottage musky smell and some outdoor bugs, typical for a country home. Comes with the territory.

The accommodations are perfect, comfortable, with everything you need. And the best part is the host, Susie.

Cleanliness is absolutely paramount for me and this place was beyond reproach and had thoughtful little details like the bud vase over the sink. Well thought out and an impressive use of such a small space. Chris and Yvette were walking back to their house from their parents’ so I met them as I pulled in. I was so very tired from my trip slowed by traffic that the bed with TV attached to the loft above became my best friend for the rest of the night. Extremely comfortable and would totally stay there again as a pit stop up north."

After the sunset you can see the stars in the night sky if it's not cloudy. We also hung around on the observation tower, and it was very nice with the cool breeze. We were there for our wedding anniversary and we had such a great and romantic weekend. I'd definitely recommend this place to visit."

Everything I needed while I traveled was available in the cottage and easy to find. Chris made a fire for me every night. The stars were so beautiful. I booked two nights but ended up staying longer and I am already planning a return visit. If you are looking for a reasonable place to stay, relaxing countryside, sparkling clean cottage with all you would want, kind and generous hosts, then book the tiny cottage. The lookout tower was also such a relaxing place to sit and just gaze at the countryside."

The cabin was tiny, but oh so quaint and well thought out- every item you could possibly need is there!! What a wonderful experience. Aside from the beautiful setting and adorable cabin, Chris and Yvette were so kind and warm and genuine. I got to the cabin late (by late I mean around 10 pm) and Chris still greeted me and made me feel at home and comfortable. In the morning I had a lovely chat with Yvette, who has such a down to earth and serene disposition. I tried to carry some of her energy to a very questionable job interview I had that day. This cabin is beyond well worth the visit because it is just so memorable."

Stayed one night","I found a charmed place in quite rural Irwinton and its Chris and Yvette’s unforgettable Tiny Cabin. If you’re looking for a way to stay in a very secluded place while still being within (very) close striking range of several cities (Milledgeville / Macon / Dublin) than this is the place. I found the hosts to be absolutely friendly, helpful, insightful and (actually) inspiring in terms of how they have built up for themselves a really fascinating way of life in rural Wilkinson Co. So this stay offers a really cool vision for a rural way of life. But beyond that there’s the reality that AirBnB travelers are always looking for comfortable places to stay and Chris and Yvette have attended to every small and hospitable detail in their (quite) modern and snug Tiny House Cabin. The bed: uber comfortable. The bathroom: spotless and quite modern and such glorious hot water. The surroundings: unforgettable with friendly chickens and a garden and nature trails to explore. I found myself intrigued with Wilkinson Co. which is so close to so much and so off-the-grid. Like many others who stayed in this unique spot, I found myself going out at night and marveling at the bright stars illuminated in the night sky (things you don’t really get to see in the city). This is a highly recommended spot to stay for those looking for a rural retreat and for those interested in being the beneficiaries of such gracious and interesting hosts. Thank you, Chris and Yvette!"

A little farm (chickens, roosters & two cool goats) was so cute. Little garden with fresh ingredients. Fire pit so sit and look at the entire galaxy as if you’re the only ones out there. Trails to wander through. We could of asked for a better, secluded little home from home. Don’t think twice about booking this home, DO IT!! You will love it!!

The house had everything we needed and the outdoor space was amazing! Our favorite was the multi-level tower complete with lots of chairs, table, and lack of light pollution so we had a beautiful view of the night sky. There are little trails all around the property, so relaxing to walk along carrying our coffee in the morning. Chris and Yvette were both so welcoming and their enthusiasm for their gardens and animals was contagious :-)"

Stayed with kids",Chris & Yvette are kind & gracious hosts. Make sure you allow time to walk through the woods & swing in the hammock. Convenient location off 441. Cozy nest for a quiet country get away! We love Magnolia & Petunia!

Stayed with kids","We enjoyed everything about staying here, one of the best weekend getaways by far! I highly recommend staying here if you are looking to relax and unwind. So many little touches to make you feel at home. We didn't want to leave or say goodbye to the sweet little goats and chickens! We will definitely be back for another stay!"

It is the perfect secluded getaway with beautiful surroundings, sunsets, hospitality and comfy accommodations.
