Stayed a few nights","I thought it was ok. When we walked inside, it looked very clean and tidy. With further inspection, things were not as though they appeared. My entire backside was covered with pet hair when I sat down on one of the recliners. I was disgusted and couldn't believe the amount of hair that was on the chair. The toilet was not clean and the bathroom floors were dirty. Since this was someone's basement, I expected some noise from upstairs but not what sounded like stomping. Our stay was short and we were only there at night time. It was ok for the price but definitely needed to be cleaned properly."

I also wish that the key code to my entrance wasn't the same as the other room on the property because I accidently walked in on someone else! Meaning they could also gain access to my room too. Ugh. Probably will find soemthjng else because of the security risk to be honest.

Stayed a few nights","Great little place to stay. We have rented quite a few places from Air BnB but this was the first that was a shared place with an owner. We were a little apprehensive initially. But turned out great. Never even met the owners and only saw what I assume is the husband in the yard a couple times. Exactly what we wanted, privacy. Had a private drive and private bedroom\bathroom. We felt comfortable the entire time. Place was clean and great for a short stay or if your active and not really gonna be in the room a ton."

Stayed about a week","We enjoyed being at Maria De Lourdes's so much! There were so many trees in her yard. The road was very busy but it was hidden by the trees. We enjoyed having our meals on the patio and we enjoyed just sitting outside enjoying the beautiful yards. The apartment was clean and cool. The bed was so comfortable. It would have been nice to have a full-sized refrigerator, but for the price we paid, we have no complaints. Maria and her husband were very nice. They shared fresh figs from their fig tree in their yard. It was an enjoyable stay and we would love to stay there again some time."

Stayed a few nights","Maria was very welcoming and greeted us in the Airbnb as we entered from her inside door. The place was as described. We left early due to my husband not feeling well, nothing to do with the Airbnb. Just a few things to note. The entry door only opens half way due to the sofa blocking it. Large people would have a difficult time entering. There were no available electrical sockets near the night stand to charge phones. Electrical sockets on one wall did not work. Found out later there must have been a a light switch somewhere that needed to be flipped. Switches by the front door most were taped down. The air conditioner works well but is extremely loud. There also is a lot of traffic noise. Walkway to the front door needs to leveled for easier entry. I don’t want this to be a bad review they were very nice people just wanted to be honest about the place."

Stayed a few nights","This was a wonderful place to stay with Maria! The room was spotless and very neat! The backyard was absolutely beautiful and the room was fairly large. The bathroom has a gorgeous his and hers sink, if you come with your SO. The only take aways are the lighting for the driveway since it’s really dark out there on that road at night and the bed was a bit stiff. I would recommend a mattress topper to ensure more comfort for the guest in the future.
She also volunteered to wash my clothing for me which I also though was very sweet. Thank you for allowing me to stay at your place!"

Stayed about a week","I recommend this place only if you drive and plan renting a car as it’s fairly far from downtown and cabs are not easy to find.
The place is cozy and I’ve never been in an Airbnb with so many amenities. Everything we needed was there.
Maria was very kind and was fast on her responses.
The room has a nice terrace with a table and chairs and the view is nice.
Negative points:
- The bed is too stiff. Feels like sleeping on a brick.
- The sofa bed is not actually a sofa bed but a sofa with a pull out bed that is not big enough for an average adult. Would be comfy for kids or teenagers or small adults.
- The room is in a family house. The doors that connect to the house are locked but it doesn’t feel very private.
- Walking from the driveway to the terrace, the path is made of concrete blocks and you aren’t able to roll your suitcase.
Overall, it was a good experience for the price."

Stayed a few nights","Maria was a friendly hostess. We did not have trouble finding the location but it was a little further out than was convenient. We had difficulty getting our luggage from the car to the steps as it was very uneven to walk on. The steps going up to the porch were dangerous as roofing shingles had been laid on them and slid around when going up or down. Getting into the front door with luggage was cumbersome as a couch jutted out and kept door from opening completely. The room was pleasant and clean. Traffic noise was bothersome.
Our biggest complaint was the very hard mattress. All other problems were small and we could have dealt with them but the mattress was too hard therefore we didn’t get much sleep. We did not stay the second night."

Stayed a few nights","Over all my stay was fine and served its purpose. Maria was very sweet and was extremely accommodating by letting me check in early. Couple of things, the room is not as pictured. Everything is differet this was not a make a break for me but I would suggest updating the listing. My only issues were that check in was difficulty and towels. I couldn't find the door. The map was hard to understand. I would suggest a sign at the edge of your yard where we turn in and the bath towel I used had someone else's hair on it. Even with those two things I would still stay here again. I'd just bring my own towels."

I checked in around 7pm and Jaime greeted me outside and guided me into my parking spot, assisted with my bags, and provided a quick tour of the suite and amenities for my stay. The bed was comfy and the mini-fridge was stocked with some bottles of water. The suite was perfect for my needs while in DaIton. It was easy to find, and I felt safe and secure the entire time. A gas station (with convenience store) and local pizza place were only moments away. Walmart and other stores and restaurants were about 10 minutes away. I highly recommend Maria and Jaime’s AirBnB — and thank them again for their hospitality!"

Stayed a few nights","Maria’s space was sparkling clean, convenient to multiple places in Georgia and Tennessee, and very affordable if you are like me … traveling on a budget. I felt right at home. Even though the space is a part of their residence - I never saw them except when I checked in. You have a private entrance and the apartment space is closed off from their living space. Maria did check on me via email to see if I needed anything. The space was wonderful; comfy bed and sofa, great work space for my laptop, big screen tv, keurig coffee pot, small refrigerator and lots of closet space… and did I mention sparkling clean?! I hope to stay here again when I return to the area. You won’t be disappointed in booking with Maria!"

My husband had to have a work video conference so it was nice to have the desk. The road was a little noisey at times but still fine for the price.

The home is located in a nice private area and has a well kept yard and exterior. The room was spacious and had all the things I needed, including a private entrance, desk, TV, couch and a comfy double bed. The private bath is just a few steps outside the bedroom in the hall. It is nicely tiled with a double sink vanity, toilet, shower and fluffy towels. I highly recommend Maria's home if you are in the area and I would definitely stay at her home again."

Stayed a few nights",Hosts responded almost immediately if we needed them. The place was very clean and decorated very nice. The sofa/daybed in the living area was not very comfortable for us but that is because my husband is recovering from knee surgery and I am awaiting hip surgery. The bed in the bedroom was very comfortable. The parking was a little challenging as we were in our big truck and not a lot of room for turning around and too steep to back out. We would have driven a different vehicle if we had known that. Only other issue is the ceiling fan in the bedroom did not work and we are used to sleeping with a ceiling fan but we made do. The kitchen was well equipped and they left plenty of bath towels. Very pleasant to deal with. I would stay again.

Stayed about a week","The only reason for the overall 4 Star Review is the driveway and a couple small things. But, this is a cute clean place and located near stores and shopping for convivence. Our kids live in Tunnel Hill GA, about 10 min from the AIRBNB which was so very close.
We came out for Christmas and enjoyed the place very much. The bed is very very comfortable which is our #1 priority due to back issues. There were very nice touches like coffee pods, tea, honey, sweeteners, creamers and everything you would need to cook. The bathroom is stocked and the washer & dryer was super helpful. Everything worked great!
We had a little bit of a hard time finding it because I did not get the exact instructions until 10:30PM while we were driving from the ATL airport, so that communication could have come sooner. We ran out of toilet paper the second day, but they brought us some within 30 min.
I recommend this place for a couple it's small but very cute and felt homey."

Some issues with connecting to Netflix but we managed just fine !! Would stay here again . They only think I would suggest is a microwave.

It literally took you into a Hobbit's home - cozy, warm, and peaceful. It is any LOTR fan's dream rental - but also perfect for anyone looking for a relaxing environment. The details were perfect. Even the towels, sheets, shower head, and kitchen supplies were more than what we were expecting for a rental. It was well worth the price and we are already wondering when we can return and who we can recommend it to.
(Jeff also let us tour one of his other properties with a similar theme and we will definitely be book it in the future.)"

We had everything we needed, although you would need to bring a hair dryer. That's not a negative, it's just informational. Location is secluded but really close to the main area with restaurants, grocery stores, and gas stations and just a 31 minute drive to Chattanooga. Jeff was very communicative and check-in and check out was a breeze. We look forward to another stay in the hobbit hole or one of the other amazing properties Jeff has."

Little hidden gems, and there is a second bedroom, look for it! 🤣 the ultimate hobbit hideaway home just right for hobbits 😂 Warm, inviting, comfortable, cozy, perfect. Parking for the house is right next to it so don’t wander up into the lands of Rohan (larger home above the hobbits) definitely will stay again. Thank you so much Jeff."

The amount of detail and creativity that went into it was well worth staying there. It's about 2 hours north of Atlanta and about 30 minutes south of chattanooga, worth leaving big city to check it out ."

Stayed a few nights","Wow.
All I can say is, wow. This is single-handedly the most incredible bnb experience I've had so far. Jeff is always a fantastic host, and he is so friendly and accommodating beyond what I would consider hospitality. The location itself is breathtaking. The photos do not do this place justice. Whether you're a fan of high fantasy or just want a warm weekend away from home, look no further. This is the place to go. From the cozy atmosphere, natural woodwork, homey, grandma's home feeling, to the fantasy inspired, mystic wonder the home bestows... This property is truly a location for everyone.
If you book this property, expect a warm welcome from a great host, a relaxing and unique stay, and a few secrets as well.
Enjoy, I certainly did."

The unit itself it top quality, spacious; comfortable, beautiful- everything you could hope for. The atrium right outside your door turns it into a place fit for Nashville, Austin, Daytona- you would NEVER expect this place to be in Dalton GA. Our one night stop on the way through turned into 3 nights just because we loved it so much. We ate every meal in the atrium- the prices are fantastic, the food is fresh and delicious, the atmosphere is so peaceful and beautiful! I can’t wait to come back!"

After 10 hours on the road it was a dream to arrive at this clean, modern, chic, spot with every amenity. The beds are so comfortable and clean. Everything is new and spotless and modern. There is even a noise machine by the bed. I took a picture of every area of the space, it is so classy and cool. We didn't realize when we arrived that you can literally walk through a door to restaurant/music/huge space! We discovered this the next morning and had the best breakfast, huge playground for the kids outside with a climbing wall etc. This put Dalton on the map for us!"

Stayed one night","Peter saved the day for me! I had another Airbnb (not hosted by Peter) reserved for several months. When I showed up on the day of check-in, I found out that the home had actually been sold to a new owner, not the person who had listed the house on Airbnb. Needless to say, I was left without a place to stay. Peter's place was the only one available in the area as it was a busy weekend (there was a large race happening in Dalton), and he went above and beyond to get me checked-in on SUPER short notice. He was highly responsive and even pulled over while driving so he could send me check-in instructions before the scheduled time when he heard of my predicament. This made a huge difference in my ability to get to the race the next day and was GREATLY appreciated. Highly recommend!"

Christy was great in all her communications and had local recommendations in a binder for us.
The neighborhood is calm and quiet. The lot is large and the grounds were well maintained.
The kitchen was stocked, 2 TVs in the place, games, a work desk.
You could live here and be just a couple of minutes from almost anything you might need.
You have a great opportunity if the dates you need are available, better book it now :-)"

Easy access off of the higway. In a nice older neighborhood. Great location for good restaurants.
The home is quiet, impecably clean, cozy and becons to a simpler time. A nice yard with big trees and birds galore.
Christy is a wonderful host always checking via text to make sure i arrived safely and see if there's anything I need ❤️
My go to cottage away from home on my trips up north. 🕊"

Stayed one night","Wow! Five-star accommodations. Need I say more? The cottage is a tranquil place that provides everything a traveler needs and more. The hosts (Christy and Matt) are very hospitable and flexible. They kindly accepted our impromptu booking and were flexible with our need for a 4 a.m. arrival time with same-day evening departure. They went the extra-mile in providing excellent hospitality, as they had the porch light and some house lights on for us when we arrived, as well as had bought some white bath towels for us given that we have allergies to the colored-dye bath towels they had for their guests. We slept like a baby in the extremely comfortable bed with wondeful linens, which was also due in part to the fact that they allow their guests to control the thermostat in the cottage! And, we also enjoyed being able to do our laundry on the premises while we looked at all of the literature they provided for the local area including eateries we had not heard of before as former Daltonians."

The home was decorated for Christmas which lead me and my partner to buy gingerbread houses to decorate. I will say it got very very cold especially in the morning. I realized it’s because the AC had been turned off in the night and wasn’t set to start again until 6pm that day but that’s bad on my part. Other than that it was a nice stay. Would’ve definitely visit again.

The street has private homes, so it is very quiet during the day and at night. You will also be very close to everything you need, supermarkets, and restaurants, and it is less than 10 minutes from the Dalton Convention center. And Christy was very quick with responding to questions. If you are in the Dalton area, you will definitely appreciate this home away from home."

Not only is the location safe and central to everything but the house itself is super cozy and has everything you will need for a stay away from home. We previously stayed at a hotel and this time decided to stay at this Airbnb and it was the best decision we could have made and changed my whole outlook on the city of Dalton. The bed was luxurious and so comfortable with the softest sheets, the kitchen was fully stocked with everything you might need, the added touches of a washer/dryer/detergent, shampoo/conditioner/body wash and the book about Dalton and things to do was just the topping on the cake. I highly recommend this sweet house and we will definitely stay again!!!"

We made such wonderful memories there during our short stay, as we were in town for my graduation. My mom, dad, and sister came over for dinner one evening and we played pool and ate in the beautiful dining room. There was more than enough space for us to comfortably enjoy ourselves.
The neighborhood was nice, quiet, peaceful, and close to all stores or restaurants. However the location of the home was in such a place that noises from traffic or people could not be heard. We felt so safe and at home!
I could go on and on about how much accommodating Althea was and how comfortable and beautiful her home was.

The only con (and it isn't really much of one) was that one of our group was on the phone in a heated discussion, not yelling, but definitely louder than normal, and the neighbor came outside and looked over at her. We didn't feel we could enjoy the backyard or fire pit due to feeling like we were being watched. I would definitely stay here again."

She went out to purchase a new one for our stay, - Thanks you so much - then my anunt decided that she was not going to make her shakes because we were on vacation.

The kitchen was well stocked for those who want to make a meal there and the bathrooms were clean and had a few toiletries if you forget yours. Highly recommend."

I was beyond thankful for stocked showers, we forgot to bring stuff. The only complaint was hubby, the driveway was steep and on the narrow side (he drove the truck this trip). We are flat land beach bums, so hills felt funny to drive on. Overall, great for the price, good location, beautiful season."

Group trip","We are speechless. Jeff has created a magical experience for LOTR lovers but the comfort and convenience of this place is perfect as well. Even grandma, who had never seen the movies or read the books, loved it, even though she ended up sharing her room with Shelob. The kids spent our stay watching the director’s cut dressed like Gandalf and Eowyn, eating second breakfast in the Prancing Pony, catching lizards outside by the dark tower and the gates to Rohan. Beds were super comfy, and the double queen bunk was perfect for my daughters to share a room. The details in this place are incredible. The welcome letter with scavenger hunt and One Ring kept us busy and the joy of finding all of the little details lasted all three days. Getting to and from Chattanooga was easy and we explored the local civil war history as well. There was a nice spot to hike just a few minutes from the house as well. Jeff gave us a peek at his newest project so we will be back to stay there too!"

Stayed with kids","This group of Lord of the Rings fans loved the place! The photos help capture the beauty and detailed attention to creating a Middle Earth experience, but there is nothing like being here! There are so many interesting artifacts to look at, that staying one night is not really enough to enjoy it all. The entrance is inviting to ""speak friend and enter"", and the wood carvings and decor throughout is spectacular. The swords, helmets, lighted torches, and welcoming touches are fabulous. The host leaves lembas shortbread to give you a boost of energy, and the ""Inn of the Prancing Pony"" decor is a happy reminder of the nostalgia. There are even cosplay outfits if you wanted to dress up and take photos, though we did not have time. There is a nice TV to watch the Lord of the Rings and other things on, but we did not have a chance. The grounds are also great with Dark Knight sculptures and the Tower of Sauron nearby. Jeff is a responsive host, and made the experience personalized. Loved!"

It seems Jeff is doing it just for his passion. We were a family of seven and had a comfortable stay. I would rather call it experience.. you feel like you got a private museum... just for you.
Jeff is down to earth, friendly person. He personally ensured we are comfortable, we met, and had a great conversation. He is flexible and very responsive. House makes you feel you are in the movie.
Its a 5-star rating, just because review the system doesn't allow more. Apart from the LOTR theme, I would anyway give it a 5-star rating just for its beautiful surroundings, amenities, and comfort."

Stayed a few nights","Being a Ringsgeek Superfan, when this ultra-impressive AirBNB was shared with me in an online group in January, my first thought was “no way!!!” WAY. After scanning the photos for a few milliseconds - though the pictures don’t ever do reality justice by a mile - I just knew that this was where I needed to be for my 50th birthday.
In my stay, I kept discovering new elements that had escaped me, and that’s precisely what i mean by an epiphany around every corner. You stumble upon something which instantly propels you into some scene of the movie, some narrative from the book, some cherished part of the running storyline that you hold dear.
A surprise lies in each room as you continue to make these discoveries and it makes your stay that much more enjoyable. This AirBNB is a genuine tour-de-force and very well could be the nicest place I’ve ever stayed. I’m not just saying that. I even slept with a balrog, and you can’t say that about every vacation home, now can you?"

So much to see that you really need more than a one night stay. Jeff got us in last minute. Provided a game and a gift. And if one was inclined.... had all the movies saved for the Ultimate Movie Experience. My favorite part was the bathroom ducks as the LOTR characters. But its the little things really. 3 big bedrooms, full working kitchen, 2 bathrooms. Lots to see and lastly laying on the bear skin and looking up at the ceiling to see Middle Earth. Host was awesome, fast response and communication from booking to checkout and a few messages after; I liked that a lot. Great Stay, cant wait to do that again. Thanks for an incredible stay."

We constantly found ourselves finding new things and wondering how they accomplished some of the details. New custom construction, very nice linens/mattresses. If you are lucky, you’ll have a chance to meet the friendly host."

Stayed with kids","My family and I recently stayed in an Airbnb and I have to say, it was an incredible experience. The location was absolutely stunning, with breathtaking views of the surrounding scenery. The house itself was immaculately clean and had every amenity we could possibly need.
But what really made the stay unforgettable was the Lord of the Rings decor and memorabilia throughout the home. As a huge fan of the franchise, I was blown away by the attention to detail and the sheer amount of items on display. It was like stepping into Middle Earth itself!
I would highly recommend this location to anyone who is a Lord of the Rings fan or anyone looking for a unique and memorable stay. The hosts were incredibly accommodating and went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable. We will definitely be returning in the future!"

The moment you step foot onto the beautifully ornate porch, you are transported into both an impressively immersive and yet lovingly crafted experience that can't help but evoke that childlike wonder and delight that many fans recall when first watching the movies. Jeff's passion for both Middle Earth and his guests is evident down to the smallest detail, and there is everything you could hope for in an accommodation (the towels are so soft!). Tolkien himself would be proud. I absolutely recommend this as your stay on your next Unexpected Journey."

Jeff is such a great guy and his sweet wife. The house is only a few minutes away from grocery stores, restaurants, and gas stations. It's also only a 30 to 35 min drive to Chattanooga, TN where you'll find Ruby Falls/ Rock City and many other things to do. I can't accurately describe how wonderful the house is. Pictures do not do it justice! It felt so cozy, clean, and most importantly felt like home to my husband and I. Do yourself a favor and check this place out, you will not be disappointed. I can't wait for our next trip! Thank you Jeff for being so great!"

I don’t have enough words to describe how fantastic this place is! From the map on the ceiling to the gorgeous chandeliers to the swords and pictures and maps and quotes everywhere! Plus there were exquisite items to admire in the display cases plus plastic swords and even period clothes to dress up in! Everywhere you looked there was something to amaze you! One of my favorite touches was the silverware! I won’t give it away but do make sure to check it out when you visit Rohan. 🙂 I could go on and on about how magnificent this place was, our expectations were high and the reality of Rohan surpassed them! Jeff, thank you for sharing this place with us and others, it is clearly a labor of love! We will be back!!"

We role played, we made steak and eggs and we lived like a King & Queen! The sinks are wood and the craftsmanship is outstanding! Jeff is very responsive also. We will be back!

They had disposable glasses and plates, thank you for that. The only drawback was that the main entrance was for the back part and not for the garage and it was raining and coming with children. I didn't understand because if there was access to the garage, you could not enter there. It's the only detail I'd suggest changing, then everything is fine"

Stayed a few nights","Jeff’s place is as described and pictured. Clean with comfortable beds. Location was convenient for our needs, however, I do feel as though the location leaves a lot to be desired. Seemingly very low income area and not an area I would considered walking around in for any reason. My husband stayed with our daughter so that was not an issue for him. Train is loud and comes by very frequently. Other reviews state the availability of sound machines to help drown out the noise but our party did not use. I think they just dealt with the noise. I think this place is fine for some people, but because my daughters and I travel alone at times I can’t say we would return based on location."

Stayed with kids","Jeff is a great communicator & host. He provided thorough instructions for how to enter the property upon arrival. There is a fairly good size fenced backyard. As soon as we entered, it was comfortable. There were ample amounts of cookware, toiletries, etc. He really did think of everything renters may need during their stay. There were 7 of us staying in the home. One person did utilize the sofa bed. The mattress for it was very thin & you could feel the springs. They ended up just sleeping on the sofa the 2nd night. The beds were comfortable. You could even smell the laundry detergent & cleanness on them. The entire house was pristine with cleanliness. Check in & check out was a breeze. Our favorite part was the garage we were able to park in during our stay! I would say the least favorite part was the train! It ran & held its horn every hour. Even with the sound machines & ear plugs, you can't miss that noise. Besides the train, it was a nice stay for the $$$."

Stayed one night","We just couldn’t endure Miami to Indiana, so we found Jeff’s very convenient place to break up the trip. Jeff responded in moments anytime I had a question. He allowed late check in. I can’t give much help on the area as we arrived late and left early and did not explore it. It’s certainly convenient to the interstate and we paid less than a hotel room and got double the space. We did hear the train and wondered if it would keep us awake. Either it doesn’t run from around midnight to 6:30 am or I was just too tired to hear it. I tried to be a good guest but broke one of the very short list of check out rules. We left expensive medication in the fridge. Then we quickly learned my sons girlfriend was missing her fanny pack. Jeff’s housekeeper made an extra trip and found it beside the couch and Jeff spent his time to properly next day the items to us. I would definitely keep this place in mind if we have a long road trip or any business in the area again."

Stayed with kids","This property exceeded all my expectations. Jeff's property is immaculate. It's really nice and clean. It was the small touches for me that made me feel right at home. I was able to have my coffee every morning which was perfect. The only downside to the place was the train passing close but honestly it wasn't too bad. Jeff supplies noise machines in the bedrooms along with ear plugs if needed. The location was also perfect. We was literally 2 mins from the gym where my son's basketball team played at which was excellent. If we are ever in Dalton again, we will definitely stay at Jeff's property."

Stayed a few nights","We had a great visit to Dalton in this space! The furnishings and beds are super comfy, the carpet and flooring felt brand new, and they added several personal touches to make the stay complete. (First aid kit, q-tips, plenty of toiletries, and also colorful ponytail elastics!) It’s close to the train tracks so our first night was noisy but when I asked Jeff if he had a white noise machine, he actually went out and bought TWO that same day & hand delivered them to us. Now THAT is customer service! We had everything we needed and more, even down to a personalized welcome note as we entered the home. He’s certainly earned his title of SUPERHOST!"

I messaged Jeff the night I got in after midnight about where an iron may be and by 8:30am, he had dropped a brand new one off on the back porch for me. He answered all questions that I had before and during my stay. It was great. If I am around this side of town again, I definitely would love to stay there again. Thank you so much for an amazing place!"

It is super-clean, and everything in it as as nice and new as it appears in the photos, from the furniture, to the appliances, to the flooring, to the paint -- it's impeccable. Even better than this is the level of consideration that the owners have put into the ""extras"". The unit included items such as tin foil, zip locks, basic cooking seasonings, snack bag clips, and new bathroom amenities (such as soap, toothbrushes, etc), in case you forgot yours. Things you wouldn't expect, but that sure were nice to have, if needed. Oh, and the softest bath linens EVER! Even the furniture was comfortable. :) The location was very convenient to tons of restaurants, fast food, grocery stores, the interstate, etc, and the communication from the owner was great. I'd gladly stay again, if in the area."

We were just there for one night on our drive to Florida, and will look at staying there on our trip back. Thanks, Jeff!"

Group trip",Jeff’s place was fantastic. The house decor was so nice. I loved the theme. We had issues entering the home (and that’s my fault for not reading the instructions) but Jeff was great at reaching out and explaining to us. I would definitely stay again. Totally recommend. Very peaceful & super comfortable. The amenities that were available were so convenient!

It was an easy decision to rent this house as it was in our local area and accepted dogs. When we arrived, we were happy to find the house extremely well stocked. For the entire 6 weeks, we only had to buy minimal supplies. Jeff was responsive to any needs and the house was perfect for our family. I highly recommend this location!"

Stayed with a pet","This was a dirty house. I wiped up the kitchen floor and my cloth was black. Refrigerator not wiped out. Cob webs greeted us at the front door. Large (3” by 3”) spill of powder blush in bedroom. Door wall lock broken. No screens on windows so could not air out the house.
The garage was dirty and we had to walk thru it. Front entrance had no handrail and was dangerously steep with non conforming stairs. No hair dryer found. Jeff notified and he offered nothing. There was hair and dead bugs on the entry way and living room floor.
I have photos I want to share.
We should have our $ refunded."

There is a great back yard for the dog with a wooded hill past the property line. I just wish I had more time to have enjoyed a bonfire in the backyard, but we were only in town for one night. Would definitely stay there again."

Stayed with kids","We stayed here on our way to Florida. Excellent communication with Jeff. Check in and out was easy. The house was cute and as pictured. What we loved: Big full kitchen, available laundry, 2 1/2 bath, able to park in the garage, lots of nice touches throughout, like soap, shampoo, a toothbrush if you forgot yours and other little amenities that were very thoughtful. The kitchen was stocked with all the basics. It was a quiet location not too far off of I75. There was also tons of closet space and hangers available to use.
Things that could use some improvement: the floors were not real clean, some towels were dusty, there was no window coverings in 2 bedrooms and the beds while very comfortable, were quite high.
Overall, I would recommend staying at this house. I would say it is not ideal for small children due to high beds, stairs and there were knives on the refrigerator. None of those were an issue for us but if you have very little children, those might not work for you."

Our biggest requirement was a home that would allow our dogs and close to home and we were so thankful that was the case. It was a comfortable place for my family to stay and in a quiet neighborhood so overall it was a great blessing to us during a time of need. We would recommend this home for anyone looking for the same.

Stayed with a pet","Nice area, house was a little dusty.. bathrooms could’ve been cleaner. Worst part was the garage door was super loose and doesn’t close the right way. Handle probably just has to be replaced. Also, being pregnant, having small children… the EXTREMELY HIGH beds was totally unbearable. Hard mattresses and thin pillows definitely weren’t great either. Host was very nice. House could be more “kid friendly” knives sticking to the fridge wasn’t a great look. Other than that, served it’s purpose."
