I have traveled to all 50 states and stayed in many beautiful hotels and resorts. For lodging around this small city, I cannot imagine there is a better property anywhere. Totally peaceful. Totally private. Totally beautiful. Totally worth the price. I have already told Kara that I want their airbnb to be my home away from home when next I'm in the area. Totally satisfied."

The location has a building across the road and next door, so not as remote as I thought it might be, but it was a great spot close to Hastings. I definitely recommend Kara’s place!"

Stayed a few nights","Scott's place was a little slice of heaven for us. He provided all the info needed for our stay in advance, and was very thorough. The house was roomy, clean, and a very comfortable and relaxing place to stay after a long drive and days full of crane watching. There were even some complimentary snacks and beverages waiting for us, which was a very nice little perk. The location was beautiful, set in beautiful farm country and had plenty of places to sit and enjoy the fresh air, look out on the soon to be wild flower field (have to go back to see that), and always greeted by 3 super friendly barn cats. It is off the beaten path but close enough to the area we spent time exploring. Ideal for what we look for. Quiet, peaceful, and unique. Scott checked in via text to make sure things were up to par and I felt confident that if we had any concerns, they would be addressed. I sincerely hope we are able to stay here again. Fantastic place, great price, and kind/friendly owner. 10/10"

Stayed with a pet","The house ain't fancy. It's an old single story farm house updated to make it very comfortable by a host that goes the extra mile to make it a great experience. If you want to stay in a house in a former historic farm yard with lots of awesome old barns and buildings, where you can turn your dog loose and take a nice walk around the thirteen acres this is it. Deer, wild turkeys and songbirds will keep you busy watching wildlife. We have stayed in a lot of AB&B's over the years and this one has to be #1 on our list. The property and access to it coupled with a super great host who you can tell cares about you being there and enjoying it makes this place special. One piece of advice - if you love the outdoors and history of the people that settled in NE make room in your schedule to spend some time here instead of checking in late and leaving early. We did two nights and are so happy we did. And oh yeah, the cats are cool and will give your pooch a lot of distance."

Stayed one night","While traveling from Omaha down to New Mexico, this place seemed like the perfect place to rest before heading further south. We were so pleased with the ambiance and cozyness of the immaculately clean house. The highlight was the visit from two unusually friendly cats that we let inside the house for a few hours for feline entertainment and companionship. before they went back outside to return to the main house. We had to leave early in the morning, so didn't have time to tour the property (which the host encouraged) but hope to do so on a return visit. Maybe in the spriing when the native plant meadow that the owners are developing comes into bloom. Marty."

Stayed with a pet","This location is beautiful! The description is spot-on and the house is spacious. There's convenient access to all the amenities listed by the owners. The place is roam-friendly for dogs and relatively private with the exception of a neighboring house that shares the driveway. And the covered patio out front is perfect for relaxing in the evenings.
If you happen to be traveling with reactive dogs, be mindful: the house next door has a dog and there were quite a few barn cats and kittens (super friendly) on the property at the time of our stay who weren't shy about trying to get into the car, house, etc. If your dog is cat-friendly, they'll get along great.
I highly recommend grabbing a cup of coffee and strolling out to the backfield at first sunrise for a peaceful and serene start to the day!"

Stayed a few nights","If you're interested in a peaceful getaway, this is an excellent location. A small farm with two houses, barns, a modern pavilion with grill and firepit, a pumpkin patch, a creek-side walking path circling their field & ending in a wooded trail; this was a treat for the price.
The host was generous; providing wine, drinks, soda, tea, snacks, locally made soaps, robes, slippers etc. A pet-loving gentleman with a seemingly easy-going nature, he seemed intent on providing a quality experience. The real difference between 4* and 5*, was that, while sociable, they never encroached on my privacy.
The house itself was quite nice; a master bedroom, spare, and children's room, a lovely bath, home-chef worthy kitchen, and a front room w/ bay windows to catch sunrise. Everything in the house is stocked; they even included board games
The only drawback is that you are a decent drive from a city & you'll want to take that into account. Cell service can be spotty, but the internet is solid."

Because of availability we were going to switch to the smaller second home on the property for our last night, but Scott kindly allowed us to stay in the larger home so we didn’t have to move during our stay. The modern farmhouse is spotless, private, and a lovely place to gather or enjoy the peace and quiet!"

He consistently is adding things to make this such a unique and beautiful time. We don't even feel like we have to leave the property to really have a full family vacation. This time I came with one more child, and next time I plan to come with another. This will be our consistent family vacation spot as so many of our loved ones live nearby. It also has become a blessing to them as many can't travel very far and it provides a bit of peace and beauty that they don't always get to experience. We absolutely loved his new deck and seeing the bees that he is now keeping. Along with the garden and how it has exploded. What a beautiful homestead. Thank you so much Scott for loving this place so well."

We have been guests at nearly 40 Airbnb locations and I have to say that Scott & Jane's place is the most comfortable and beautiful that we have been to. We stayed for over 2 months and the time flew by! It broke our hearts to leave. This was our very first visit to Nebraska, and now we are seriously considering moving there someday.
We arrived in time for the Sandhill Crane migration in March - it was amazing! Scott's place is teaming with wildlife and loaded with beautiful song birds. It's was food for the soul and we can't wait to come back someday - Scott made us feel like family!"

Our dogs loved getting to explore some of the land, and we enjoyed walking around some of the original buildings on the property. Again, we wish to come back when we can spend more time outdoors. We loved all the little touches like slippers, robes, and snacks, and my son quickly went through the pennies for the gum machine😋 This home is so cozy and inviting. Each room has a portable heater and tons of blankets and LOTS of extra towels.
Thank you for sharing this property full of history and coziness to us 💜

Stayed with a pet","Scott and Jane have something very special--their homes have it all. EMPHATICALLY FIVE STARS
We've always loved the Great Plains and have at times made compromises to experience an authentic life here.
Staying at Scott's and Jane's doesn't require any compromises; it's a perfect Plains experience. Blazing internet 10 miles outside of town under unbelievable skyscapes day and night (?!?). Soothing railroad soundtrack not too close, just right. Kind and soulful designs and amenities that encourage time together. A lovely, manicured prairie path to encourage steps and outdoor engagement. Great beds, easy appliances, and stellar climate comfort.
Everything hit us just right and we give a SUPER STRONG RECOMMENDATION .
Thanksgiving Day, the Nebraska wind was just howling, 30+ MPH, but those cedars and mighty elms shielded us and created a perfect calm around our gathered family. That's when I knew just how lucky we were to stay here. We were secure and protected and focused on good times together. It was just amazing and we are so grateful."

Stayed with a pet","We're on a roadtrip to Georgia and this home was the perfect place for us to stop by for the week while we work remotely. Below are what we enjoyed and one thing that could be better (although definitely no deal breaker for us. More for awareness...). Thanks for the stay Scott and Jane!
We enjoyed:
1) the 13 acres of fenced yard (note that there are openings in the fence that our medium size dogs have escaped and they once went on the road so we had to keep an eye on them at all times).
2) fully stocked home with drinks, snacks, toiletry.
3) very kind and attentive hosts. Scott came quickly to fix the freezer being stuck and love the food recommendations from Jane!
4) the home location is peaceful and located amongst farms.
5) the walking loop trail in the fenced backyard made nice morning, afternoon and evening walks with our pooches.
6) Fast internet.
What could be better:
1) the home is on a dirt road where cars drive through fast. The windows facing the road could use an upgrade so that it seals completely to prevent fine dust coming in."

There was a path cut around the pasture where I could walk my dog and she loved the area so much. There was so much for her to explore. There were snacks left out along with wine and some more goodies in the fridge which was an unexpected amazing touch. Host was there just in case we needed anything upon checking in and was very friendly. I'd definitely find myself here again for a longer period! I wish I could give more than 5 stars for this stay.

Stayed one night","We can’t thank Scott enough for taking the time to meet and help us out on Saturday evening. It was a pleasure to meet him and his lovely daughter. Zeke and Bruiser (our dogs) loved meeting new people and their socialization is very important, so thank you for being so patient with them. They loved spending a little time with your daughter and could have let her pet them for only about the next 12-15 hours. 😆
1- Excellent facility and grounds, the country feel that it provides is familiar for us as we also live in a farm community. The difference is that the wide open space allowed our boys to run and smell and chase to their hearts content.
2- The special amenities that are provided are above and beyond what we have ever experienced before with an AirB&B location. The snacks were a godsend (sorry we pilfered so many 😊) as we arrived so late and hadn’t had any food since breakfast. We very much appreciated them. Also the red wine was very good. We only had a glass each as it was late, but have the rest of the bottle for tonight. Thanks again for that.
3- The deck/fire pit area was fantastic. The lighting was perfect and put us at ease almost immediately. We wish/ hope that our third stay will have something like this. It was a perfect setting for us to celebrate our faux honeymoon as we never were able to have one since we got married in 2011, just know that the 1st night of our trip is considered to be a perfect setting to start out this trip.
4- The home was immaculate and very clean. Judging from the clearly defined sanitary scent coming from the back storeroom, it is clear that Scott takes cleaning and sanitation as the highest priority.
Thanks again, and if we are ever passing through Ayr again you can be SURE we will be booking our stay with you.
Dennis 👍🏼🥃"

There were plenty of cookware and utensils and even extra dog dishes in case we had forgotten ours.
But the real attraction was outside the house! The kids had so much fun exploring the barns and hammocks that we had a hard time getting them back in the car.
Scott also communicated clearly about how to access the property and other important details.
Overall it was a great experience. My husband was grumbling a little bit about having to drive a little ways off the highway, but when we got there he quickly agreed that it was worth the short detour! The peace, quiet, and comfort made a wonderful break from a long car trip."

Stayed a few nights",We absolutely loved our stay of 6 nights at this location. It was so peaceful and relaxing. There are hundreds of trees filled with singing birds and the old-time farm atmosphere brought back a lot of memories. We will definitely come back. Scott was a terrific host and very accommodating.

Stayed with a pet",This place exceeded all our expectations. The pictures look nice but don’t fully capture the serenity and rejuvenating energy of this property. After several days on the road this was the perfect place to rest and reset. Between the distant lightning storm at night and the bird songs and foggy meadow in the morning we felt so at ease there. The large property is fun to explore and our elderly dog loved it too. Thanks for being a great host!

Full kitchen, stacked with drinks and snacks was a first for us and we were blown away at the level of detail! Bathroom was one of the nicest I’ve seen, wildlife watching section was amazing. Only thing I would change that would bring me back for a whole weekend is a hot tub. That’s the only thing I felt was missing from the ranch, especially cause you get so many towels lol
Stay here as soon as you can and stay on a real ranch!"

Stayed with kids","What a remarkably responsive host! Scott replied lightning-fast to all communication and was just extremely kind and helpful in every way. We arrived late and he had the house lit up and ready for us. There were snacks for us and the kids, a variety of drinks, and I was so happy to discover coffee and decaf coffee in the morning too. We were traveling with our 3 and 5 year-olds and really enjoyed all the special kid items! There’s a little table and chairs that they used, lots of kids books we looked through, and even kids plates and utensils. Thanks so much for that! At times, while doing online work, the wi-fi was a bit spotty, but it was also very rainy the whole time we were there. The DirecTv is a great setup, especially when traveling with kids. Thanks for such a pleasant stay!"

Stayed with a pet","This place is amazing! This was my second time staying and it gets better every time. Scott sent a very detailed note with check-in process, updates to the Airbnb, and other information a week beforehand. They have a new covered deck which is so amazing! Our first night there, Scott sent a message reminding us of some unique features like the paved pathway through the pasture since we had our dog with us. It’s a great walk and so fun for the dog to be off leash and explore. You feel secluded due to the trees surrounding the property and no close neighbors beside the other house on the property. Wifi worked great for the time that we needed it. They have everything you need on hand: toiletries, washer/dryer & detergent, dishes, etc.
Scott replies so quickly to any questions / comments and really makes it feel like you’re staying at a friend’s place. We will definitely be back!"

Nice large bedrooms, comfortable kitchen and dining room. Very clean and homey. Unfortunately, we didn’t spend too much time on the property as we were in the area for graduations; however, we had the pleasure of grilling out & the experience was amazing.

But then again, I understand that may not apply to everyone. Overall a very nice stay and we appreciated all the little things like the bottle of wine, snack basket, board games, and adorable children's room."

The games are so great - wish we had time to play them, and the property is just awesome and so much fun to explore (especially the walking trail). Super close to Hastings for whatever you need (we were here for a Moderna trial visit). Scott is an awesome guy, super communicative and interesting- wish we had more time to get to know him and hear about all his adventures, but our paths crossed briefly when he was cleaning the other property on site. Secluded, quiet, pretty magical at night, and super comfy. Can’t recommend enough!"

Walking in the side door, you’ll find a porch filled with all of the extra things you might need (extension cord, kitchen gadgets, slippers), then you step into the kitchen, which was stocked with essentials. The dining room is a cozy spot for 3-4 people to eat. The living room is comfy and set up with ample places to set a drink and places to pile in for a cozy movie or a game night with one of the several board games. The bedrooms were comfortable and well set up (including the bunk bed room with toys and books). The bathroom was spotless and had everything you might need.
Outside was just as cozy, the trees, art, and barns made it feel like a real retreat. There was tons of room to walk and play outside, including a path cut around the field. Everything was beautiful in a cozy, simple, non-pretentious way and exactly what my friends and I needed for our mastermind retreat.

Stayed a few nights","Ryan's place is a mediocre abnb to stay.
If you are going to spend the amount of money for two nights (which was required) then I would expect Ryan's place to be charming .
It is not. Very rustic and drab.. Curtain used to close off the bedroom. King size bed which barely fit in the area of the bedroom. One lamp for reading and flicked off and on . Bedding and pillows very old .
Furniture old and used. Lamp in living room was falling apart.
Bathroom shower unacceptable. Floor of shower stained. Stackable washer and dryer in Bathroom. Only place to put personal bathroom items was on the lid of the washer.
Curtains in living area old. Opened windows for fresh air and window sills full of dead bugs.
So who is Ryan. Sure did not meet him."

Stayed a few nights","We are fairly local and had girls weekend here, and wow… stunning property! It was so peaceful and honestly so fun to walk around and see all the beautiful landscaping and trees.
WONDERFUL amenities! Everything you could need to cook/bake/grill. Bug spray, kids games/chalk, books, extra pillows, blankets, washer/dryer, etc!
The only thing we thought would be different was the distance from the guesthouse to the stock tank pool and the firepit/pond. We couldn’t really tell by the photos that it wasn’t right outside the door/porch of the guest house. We ended up not using the stock tank or the firepit because it was a walk to get to both of them and we really didn’t want to lug everything that we wanted/needed there and back.
Overall, it was a clean living space. Very quaint and homey decor. GREAT SPACE for girls weekend. We had many laughs, slept great, and enjoyed the outdoors as well as the inside (the AC worked well for those 90 degree days!).
Thanks!"

Stayed with a pet","My wife and I hadn't left the city for a vacation in years, so when we decided it was long past time to do so we knew we wanted something that was ""away from it all"" and pet friendly. Afterall, what kind of couple would we be if we couldn't take our Aussie and Border Collie to the country with us. :) This gem was recommended to us by a dear friend, and it did not disappoint. The homestead was gorgeous, the skyline went on forever and the firefly show every night at dusk was equally as beautiful as the lightning show that could be seen in all directions.
Absolutely peaceful, quiet, adorable and plenty of trails to walk on the property. Only 15 min from Hastings made quick trips to the store easy peasy and to be honest, if the homestead owners were home, we never once noticed, let along saw them. I know we will be back when it's time to relax and rejuvenate again. Worth every penny."

The scenery/property was the highlight of our trip. Beyond peaceful and lots to do, without having to leave and spend money! The hosts were very responsive and even held conversations with us a few times. Their farm dog, Sully, was our favorite. Definitely don't recommend fishing if he's around (he loves to jump in after the bobbers) but our pup and him got along great! We played fetch with them in the pond for hours, and even left him a souvenir squeaky ball ;)
Very clean, quiet and comfortable. Anything you could possibly need, was stocked in the Airbnb for our convenience and use. Checking in and out was a breeze! Definitely will be back and highly recommend to anyone wanting a PEACEFUL & private getaway with all your outside activities at your fingertips with family, friends & your pups!"

Group trip","We had a wonderful time here! There is so much to look at around the property including scenery and antiques! We saw something new every time we looked around! The place is amazing and something to do for everyone whether it’s hiking, lounging by the pond, or a dip in the horse tank. The amount of info provided in the guest book is everything you could and would ever need to know about the property and the surrounding area which was amazing!
There is a new young lab on the property that is probably the friendliest dog I have ever met and loves everyone and really, really wanted to play with my Mom and my dog. A lot! It was a bit much for my Mom (in her late 60s) and my small pooch, but we spoke with the charming couple at the main house and they kept an eye out immediately. Not a problem, but felt it worth mentioning and to also point out how attentive and awesome the property owners are! We ran into them a few times and enjoyed our chats!
Amazing property and wonderful hosts!"

We stayed here while visiting the Willa Cather home in Red Cloud, thirty minutes away, and I was VERY glad we chose a slightly longer drive to stay here--the activities around the barn were my kids' favorite part of the trip. We paddleboated, swam in the horse tank, explored the trails around the farm, watched the sunset from a bluff up over a creek, petted the very friendly cat, had a fire in the fire pit on the sandy beach near the pond, caught frogs at the pond, and played some of the games in the cabinet under the TV.

Stayed with a pet","We needed a little get away from literally everything and this location provided it. Located off the grid in southern Nebraska - you'll find yourself surrounded by cornfields and a river.
We appreciated the ease of arrival and the comfort of the ""barn"". It was easy to sink into that ""home away from home"" feeling. The beds were comfortable, as was the ""living room"", and we appreciated the stove, microwave, fridge, and bathroom with shower. We took our own food and that made it so much easier for meals. We also appreciated the availability of games. We played a couple.
We adored the whimsical decor of the outside. Our dogs, who are very much city dogs, lived their best life running free along the trails around the property. That's not something they get to do in the city and we could tell they LOVED it, as did we.
The only thing that we found to be a little uncomfortable was the proximity of the pond and fire pit that are advertised to the home of the property owners. They're in the back yard, very near the house. We had planned on having a night of enjoying time around the fire pit but we didn't feel comfortable doing that as we didn't want to bother the family. That is definitely something that is just a personal feeling on our part - we don't like to feel intrusive. Plus, one of our dogs doesn't have good manners and barks and whines a lot and we felt bad about that.
Overall, this is a VERY neat place and we will probably visit again when we need some time away. It's so cool that this space is available in rural Nebraska."

Stayed with a pet","This is a lovely property! We stayed in the winter, but would like to come back in warmer months to experience the deck, pond, tank and walking trails. The place is perfectly serviceable, but the ""rustic"" in the listing title is warranted. The kitchen is very basically equipped so if you are planning to do a lot of cooking best to pack in equipment (pots & pans, cutting boards, knives, etc). The other thing to note is that the downstairs bedroom is *only* excessible from the exterior so you have to go outside and use the exterior staircase to move between the lower bedroom and the upper living/bedroom space. It works, but is a pain if the weather isn't cooperating. All in all, good quality for the price and a fun cabin-like spot to meet up for a rural retreat with friends or family."

We loved the pizza from the Blue Hill Tavern nearby and thoroughly enjoyed Kool Aid Days in Hastings. The location of this house was perfect for us and Ryan was amazing to work with."

The setting is beautiful- I loved the trails that Tom has developed and the pond and stock swimming tank were perfect. Kind of felt like I had stepped in God’s playground from my childhood! It was refreshing to my soul! Lavonne

Stayed with kids",My family and I wanted to get away for awhile before before school started back up and let me tell you this was an awesome peaceful experience. The property is absolutely beautiful and maintained. His parents were some of the nicest people I’ve meant. We did a lot of fishing and a lot walking through the trails. It was really hot while we stayed and the stock tank was a great way to cool down. My daughter didn’t wanna leave this place. It was my first experience with an Airbnb and let me tell you it sat my expectations high. I would recommend this place to everyone!

We did a lot of fishing and swim in the horse tank too!
We attempted to use the paddle boat but there was a lot of dirty water in it so it was in need of being cleaned up. There was a fire pit which was nice too, but the wood that was left for it was wet and wouldn't burn. We made s'mores on the gas grill instead."

The grill at the guesthouse wasn't in the greatest shape, but we used the griddle inside instead. Our dog was very obsessed with getting to the farm cats but had a blast playing with the farm dogs. The firepit on the beach made for a perfect night, but I'd check in before swimming in the pond. We just stuck to the horse tank since it was chlorinated and it was great for the kids to swim in."

Jeff is a great host easy to communicate and we got some snow with ice on Monday morning which Jeff was right there salting to keep us safe. When he was finished, we asked him to step inside and explain to us more about the homestead house he designed through his hard work. He definitely created a wonderful Airbnb in the countryside. Everything about our stay was great. The house so clean,
beautiful and relaxing.
We highly recommend staying here if you’re going to be in the Doniphan NE area. (located between Grand Island, Nebraska and Hastings, Nebraska).

Hattie’s Homestead is wonderful in every way.
Clean, spacious, well stocked kitchen, beds are very comfortable and bathrooms are immaculate as is the whole house and grounds.
Our stay was perfect!
Our families that stayed there and guests that visited were very impressed with this home away from home.
The tranquility of the home is so relaxing compared to bustle of a hotel.
Jeff was very quick to attend to any and all requests; not that there were any. He just stopped by to make sure all was well and even cautioned us about possible severe weather one evening.
A little reluctant to post such a great review, since it may work against us for our next stay; but Jeff and Julie are SUPER HOSTS and deserve the credit.

Stayed a few nights","An ideal spot for a Trip to see the Cranes!
This farmhouse, recently remodeled, was built in 1898 and has been in the family for over 100 years. The beds were very comfortable and the rooms of nice size. The kitchen was great and well equipped with two dining tables or high table nearby. the living room was also nice and the TV was easy to use.
The grounds are your own, nearest house is about 1/4 mile away. The home is off a gravel road, 1/4 mile from a paved road. You can get into Hastings very quickly and we bought groceries at Russ' near the downtown. You can also turn right on the paved road and go to the Crane dusk/dawn viewing site within 10 minutes or so. (Fantastic viewing there evene in mid day. (we were there in early April (1-4). whooping cranes come in after the Sandhill Cranes have peaked. One whooping crane was seen on Platte river road just east of the viewing area on April 4. there were also deer, and Blue winged teals (6) on the pond at the riverside viewing area 9same one mentioned above. The Crane Trust is just one mile farther north and worth a visit, this is Alda road. taking Alda to the south takes you to Juniata.
We enjoyed Ozzies rest. in Doniphan. Looks like a rough place but is not. Very nice staff and decent food, though the vegetable are not much. We also went to the Plainsman in Juniata. It was ok.
But in Hastings, there is a great lunch spot - the Backyard Bakery, on the south side of 2nd street near Denver street. VEry good sandwiches and soups, pastries and breads too. Pleasant staff!
The museum in Hastings is also worth a stop. And the college has open house at their observatory once a month near new moon.
Back at the house, it sits in a little depression behind and an intermittent creek runs across the street. So views are good out front. there are several squirrels, two are black ! Red tailed hawks were around for two days. You can ask to turn off the pole light out back and view stars (Bortle scale around 4.5, i would say) IOW, Milky way visible but not bright.
the home was very quiet and nice and we say Cranes all up and down roads only a few miles away. It is a great place to relax and enjoy the Crane viewing ! and the host is superb!"

The host was incredibly hospitable and kind, communicated in a timely manner, and even stopped over to make sure we had everything we needed for a comfortable one night stay. As soon as we walked through the back door, the cleanliness and quality of the house were our first impression. We would have happily stayed for another week in Nebraska because of the high quality of the property, the first class service provided by the host, and the serene location!

The bathroom is very small, and with it being the only bathroom in a house that ""sleeps 10"", it seems very insufficient. The kitchen was very nice, open, and there was plenty of counter space ."

Stayed a few nights","This is a relatively small house by current standards but about the same as the other homes in the neighborhood. The house is clean attractive and comfortable--our overall experience was positive. All appliances appeared to be new or nearly new, and spotless.
A few drawbacks you might want to know about. 1) The description of the steep driveway is accurate. Our Accord scraped a little on entry but wasn't damaged at all. Once you're off the street, the driveway is pretty level.

2) It wasn't an issue for the two of us, but if you're bringing more you should know that the one bathroom is accessible only through the bedroom.
Again these are very minor issues and we would stay here again if we had an occasion to stay in Hastings. Good and safe travels to all."

I stayed here for 3 weeks while in town to be with my sister who is undergoing chemo treatment, and it was the perfect retreat after some long, hard days. It was not only immaculately clean, it was located in a pretty little neighborhood where I felt comfortable getting out to walk by myself in the evenings. The couch was comfy and there were throw blankets so I could cozy up and watch a movie on the big screen TV, and the bed was probably more comfortable than my bed at home! There is a big closet with extra hangers, blankets & pillows, and a well-appointed kitchen, which made cooking a breeze. It's been recently remodeled so it feels like a new home! Crystal was a wonderful host... she went out of her way to leave me a wonderful welcome gift & was super helpful when I reached out to her for some information on the local area. This little town is a gem and so is this home! I will definitely stay here on my future visits to Hastings!"

It was remodeled nicely and the hosts made everything very easy. For a lifelong Nebraskan that's been in old farmhouses before it was well appointed and nice, but not much novelty to it. The bathrooms were especially nice and the farmer on the adjacent land working the field until dusk was a more enamoring than annoying."

Stayed a few nights","We had a fantastic stay at the farmhouse! Our group of 4 found the kitchen to be incredibly well-equipped, allowing us to cook our own dinners with ease after picking up groceries in Hastings. The cleanliness and spaciousness of the place were impressive, and we thoroughly enjoyed exploring the area on foot, particularly walking along the creek bed. For bird enthusiasts, there were plenty of sightings to enjoy. The addition of beautiful kitties from the barn greeting us was a charming touch. We also had a blast playing air hockey - a great bonus! Overall, the farmhouse provided a spacious and comfortable retreat for our getaway."

Cooking supplies were everything we could hope for and the open floor plan made it easy to enjoy one another's company during meal prep and clean up. The kids (and adults) loved the game table upstairs and the many board games. We had several walks over the property and enjoyed the company of the barn cats who made sure we didn't get lost. Sunrise from the porch was a chilly delight. Thanks for a wonderful holiday in a beautiful spot!"

Stayed with kids","This was our second time at one of Scott's properties, and it was even better than the last! Our first stay at Scott's was the smaller cabin and everything was perfect then just as everything was perfect at the bigger farmhouse now. Scott and his family are the perfect hosts!! We were arriving around dusk, so Scott made sure lights were on for us. Everything in the home was easy to find and easy to use. Scott was super quick to answer any questions, though we didn't have to ask for much b/c it seemed everything had already been thought of! The property is beautiful. I enjoyed my time sitting on the deck, relaxing and listening to the cicadas. We even made friends with a little family of farm cats. With two vacation homes on the same acreage, we never once felt a lack of privacy. There is plenty of space between the two homes, and private rooms (bedrooms, bathrooms) do not face the other home. We absolutely enjoyed our stay and cannot wait to be back again!!"

It literally has everything you need, especially the kitchen. We made the most delicious meals here with the help of the beautiful vegetable garden next door. It is so peaceful and quiet. The star gazing is great from the driveway and we were lucky enough to get a clear night to watch a meteor shower. Scott is a great host - very friendly and helpful. He knew we were in for the meteor shower so he gave us some tips for how to best view it from the property. Thank you so much again!"

Stayed one night","From the moment we drove onto Scott’s property my mind was excited by the beauty around us. When we walked into their home we were greeted with a bowl of goodies and a bottle of wine clearly saying “welcome! come on in, make yourselves comfortable!” The kitchen & pantry was the most well stocked kitchen I had ever experienced before. In the fridge there was butter, beer, juice, pop, & condiments. In the pantry you had practically any spice needed to cook a gourmet meal plus items like olive oil, coffee, canned goods, a few paper goods, quality higher end silverware, plates, cutlery and so much more. It was refreshing. Nothing worse then having to suffer through with subpar cutlery & spices as you prepare your family a meal. I mean we were not in want of anything here from start to finish. The grounds were manicured and beautiful to walk and take in. We came for a night but wanted to stay forever. Definitely will look them up for a family reunion."

We loved sitting out there listening to the passing thundershowers. The kids and grownups had plenty of active entertainment options to unplug and interact. Scott even provided the fire pit and firewood for our s’mores ingredients! With completely modern appliances and basic pantry items we were able to enjoy preparing meals together for our group of ten. Scott gave clear directions and descriptions, and answered all of my questions promptly as we were preparing for the trip as well as while we were on site. This is a great place to escape the chaos of city life and/or family schedules for a few days."

The large table is perfect for sharing fun, food and a lots of laughter. Scott is always will to help out to make sure your stay is perfect. He even took time out of his weekend to get the sauna ready for us to use and gave us the perfect history lesson on saunas to add a little insight into the fun.

Stayed with kids","We booked this listing pretty far out as we were traveling for a wedding. This was our first time using AirBnB, but we have used other home share sites. We chose this listing for several reasons, one was the proximity to the wedding, which was in Hastings, the other was the privacy surrounding the home.
Almost immediately after we booked, Scott reached out to us letting us know he received our booking and would give us details about a week prior to our stay. He also said if we had questions to feel free to reach out. About a week prior I reached out just to confirm because I worry and hate last minute suprises. Scott was super friendly and kept in contact with me until our arrival date (and after). He even gave us a link to the exact directions to the home. Upon arrival, we were so excited to see this listing was exactly as pictured. There was plenty of space for my husband and our 4 kids (18, 16, 13, and 10). The boys stayed in the room with the air hockey table, which they loved. There were plenty of games (card and board) for us to play as a family, even a few we never heard of.
My husband and I enjoyed our coffee on the huge porch while we watched our children play in the yard.
The location was only about 15 to 20 minutes to Hastings, depending on what part of town you wanted to get to and easily accessible from the highway. If we travel back to Nebraska, we hope this farmhouse will be available as it truly was our home away from home."

Every time I turned around, I found another amenity, detail and touch of home to marvel at. The amount of work and love that has gone into this place is apparent in every square inch. The kitchen is incredibly well stocked with high end appliances and every kitchen gadget you’d ever need. The bathrooms make it seem like you are staying at a luxurious resort. I think I will miss the gorgeous spa-like shower most of all. The bedrooms are cozy, comfortable and beautifully decorated and furnished. But the absolute best part was just having a place to unplug and slow down. Sitting on the deck, with my dog, watching the fireflies and the fire in the fire pit as the sun set and the sky turned purple is a memory I will cherish forever. Thank you, Scott, for this beautiful place. It was perfect and we hope to stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I have stayed at our fair share of airbnbs that describe themselves as rustic or rural. Many if not most tend to rely heavily on this particular aesthetic to compensate for a lack of cleanliness or value. Be assured, traveller, this is not one of those airbnbs.
Scott did a great job of making this airbnb appealing on the inside and out. It sits on a property with another rental and several farm structures and gardens. The rural farm vibes are very much present. There is also a large front port with string lights and plenty of furniture (note there are several steps to gain access to the only entrance).
Inside is where we were especially impressed. The kitchen has high-end appliances (ge cafe and moccamaster coffee maker) and cookware, a gas stove, and a pantry that is well stocked. Scott also left several snacks and drinks out for us.
There are two beds and a bath upstairs but we spent most time downstairs in the kitchen/living area. There is also one bed and one bath downstairs. The bathroom is large and well designed. There is a walk in shower with multiple shower heads, double vanity, backlit mirror, etc. The owners clearly put a lot of time and money into making this place feel premium.
Hastings is a 15 min drive to the north and is the place to go if you are looking for restaurants or a Walmart.
We would definitely recommend this airbnb to anyone staying in Nebraska.
There is a lot of pressure to leave 5 star reviews on this site. This is one of the rentals that I feel truly deserves it."

Stayed with kids","Another amazing stay at the farmhouse! We have been to Scott’s farmhouse multiple times and it never disappoints. He always has the house clean, ready to go, and is available should we need anything. The property also continues to have many great additions every time we come back. The garden was our kid’s favorite this trip. We can’t wait to go back!"

Stayed with kids","Our stay here was absolutely amazing! We stayed with our four girls (ages 7, 6, 4 and 4) and they LOVED the room upstairs with the air hockey table, playing outside with the toys that were provided in the little white outbuilding, and walking the trail that goes around the edge of the property. We also loved having s’mores with the supplies provided! This Airbnb has EVERYTHING you could need: snacks, wine and local soap as a welcome gift, all of the spices, condiments and kitchen gadgets you could need, robes and slippers (also a huge hit with the kids) and plenty of towels and toiletries. Our kids didn’t want to leave! Would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed with a pet","This is an amazing home! Thoughtful and kind thoughts are strewn about. We felt so loved and pampered from the moment we arrived. A basket of goodies awaited us as hungry travelers, the friend was stocked with condiments that helped our grocery budget stretch. Drinks of all kinds were left for our party in the fridge, sweet notes helped us understand other fun things we can do at the house.
There were fresh artisan soaps left as a gift for us to take with on our journey home. Pet friendly location but no evidence of hair and other pets before us. The place was nicely cleaned and well cared for.
Loved the property lay out and over all beauty of the home. Need to figure out a reason to come stay here again. Such a treat!!!"

Stayed one night","Y'all. This place. It is an oasis, a slice of heaven -- hands down, it is the best place I have ever stayed in when making a reservation on AirBnb.
The property is secluded and private -- perfect for a family getaway or an intimate weekend away. The house is absolutely gorgeous, and it could suit a variety of guests: a couple looking for a romantic trip, a group of college friends who want to catch up, a small family reunion, or a bachelorette party. Really, anything you can dream up, Scott can cater to it.
Scott thought of EVERYTHING in anticipation of our visit. Check-in and -out are keyless, which makes coordinating arrival and departure a snap. The fridge was stocked, and the kitchen is the best I've ever seen as an AirBnb guest. The beds are so, so comfortable, the showers are spacious and stocked with anything you could need (hair tools, even a diffuser; premium soaps and shower products; comfy and fluffy towels), and the place was SPOTLESS. The welcome basket (full of candies, chips, healthy snacks, local artisanal soaps, and WINE!) was so, so thoughtful, and the place was incredibly well-decorated.
Again, an oasis. Plenty of parking. I could keep going -- but, all you need to know is that you have to find a reason to visit Ayr to stay in this incredible place. It was the perfect stop on our cross-country move from Boston to Denver, and the gorgeous home and incredible service made it an unforgettable and relaxing evening after days of stress and driving. I cannot thank Scott enough for such a wonderful experience and every need and desire was fully anticipated (even the ones I didn't know I had!); I cannot imagine I'll ever stay in another AirBnb that was this fantastic. Many thanks, Scott -- already looking at dates to return; this is a special place now for my family."

The farmhouse is sparking clean and full of any cooking staples and cookware you may need. You are also greeted with a generous snack basket, and there are robes and slippers to make the place seem extra cozy. Scott also went out of his way yo show us around the property, tell us the history, and even help us to use the sauna he built by hand. It was truly a wonderful experience for my family, and we hope to make it back!!"

Everything about the farmhouse is comfortable soothing practical and efficient, with a sense of pride instilled into everything from the deck to the kitchen to the walk in showers and beds. You can rest assured you will be happy with your stay. There is a respect and honor for the land and sustainability that I truly appreciated.
Scott has really inspired me to build my own sauna;, he has very creatively reinvented an old horse trailer into a luxurious mobile wood burning cedar oak sauna with panoramic windows and Bluetooth speakers/led lights that is just fantastic and if I must say genius!"

Scott was an amazing host that stayed in communication from the time we booked until the time we checked out. He answerd any and all questions and gave reccomendations for local places to check out. He also provided an amazing selection of little extras that went over very well like local soaps and an assortment of lotions and bath amenities as well as wonderful gift basket with snacks.

Group trip","With the pandemic we needed a change of scenery (our house) and decided at the last minute to head east (from Colorado) for the long weekend. So, we chose this farmhouse just outside of Hastings, NE where there is a liberal arts college and a cute downtown. Unfortunately, it was too cold to randomly walk around town so, we mainly stayed inside the house with another family who joined us for the adventure. And, that was just fine. The house has been remodeled and is decorated very tastefully. No complaints about the beds. The game room/bedroom upstairs with a large tv and air hockey table was plenty big for 4 kiddos, and they seemed to appreciate the space. The kitchen was well stocked with everything you could have possibly needed, and Scott was thoughtful enough to have beverages and snacks available. There were also a variety of games for all ages, which was also appreciated given the low temps during our short stay. Circling back to being thoughtful, Scott swung by the 13 acre property while we were there to snow blow the driveway...good dude! We would definitely stay here again if we find ourselves heading across Nebraska. Oh, Pacha soap co. was born here, and they have a manufacturing warehouse in Hastings. They don't have an actual shop you can visit, but they do offer tours during non-pandemic times!"

They have absolutely everything you’d need.. food, appliances, (feminine products!), every & any board game, a bottle of wine, anything that’d be in your house is in their’s! They even left a gift basket for their guests.
We had three kids along with the 6 adults and they accommodated for all of us! Even bringing a high chair & baby gate over for us.
Oh.. and the SHOWER! That bathroom someone could live in. It makes you feel like you’re in Hollywood. It’s beautiful!

Stayed with kids","The quintessential AirBnB...fresh flowers, beautiful art, great place to cook and host a family getaway. Cozy, too. The outside area was fantastic with a huge deck. Even in the winter, we had a warm-ish day and had lunch on the deck. The personal touches of a welcome basket, drinks in the fridge and lots of pantry items was like no AirBnB I’ve visited.
A true gem! We hope to come back when the sandhill crane migrate in 2021."

Group trip","We were amazed in every aspect of Scott’s place. We received outstanding hospitality from the time we starting looking (before even booking) at his place all the way through checkout. The house is located close enough to a major highway for convenience, but far enough away to really relax. There were several unique touches in the decor that shine through in both an informative and entertaining light. We found the house to be immaculately clean and extremely comfortable. The amenities available to our group were way above what was listed and beyond our personal expectations. Would recommend to anyone who is looking for a peaceful getaway. Thanks again Scott, we will be back."

Group trip","If we could give this place 6 out of 5 stars, we would. We have stayed at many AirBnB locations around the world and this one is truly world class. The location is about 20 minutes outside of Hastings, Nebraska off a dirt road on a tranquil farm. Let’s start with the owner. Scott was so responsive, helpful, flexible and generous. The attention to detail was incredible with a welcome basket when we arrived, fresh flowers, slippers and robes, wine, not a detail was missed. Hastings is the home of Pacha soap company so we were gifted a few bars of this wonderful, soap as well. We are truly grateful for all he did. The farm house still has a few reminders of the original farmhouse like exposed fireplace and then everything else was modern, immaculate, beautifully designed and appointed. This place could be featured in any design magazine for an example modern, farm house. Everything seemed brand new. The kitchen was well stocked and the little things like salt, pepper, oils, spices were all there which makes it so much easier to cook and not have to remember all those details. The beds were so comfortable and then the two walk-in showers with “rain” style shower heads added to the spa feeling. At night it becomes magical, because the old fashion windmill outside is lit up and the front porch is strung with bulbs as well. The front porch is a perfect gathering place with comfortable sofas and tables. We had a family gathering and are so appreciative of the space. Across the dirt driveway is a second house, we had more family staying in that property too so between the two houses there are 6 bedrooms, perfect for family reunions. The grounds are well maintained, a photographers dream with a beautiful white barn, rustic wood haybarns, metallic grain bins and fields of grasses as far as the eye can see. Staying here was a gift to our family. Thank you Scott!!"

Scott didn’t miss a single detail and was so thoughtful in making sure we had everything we needed. He went above and beyond to make this such a cozy stay. In terms of cleanliness and covid safety, which we are very concerned with, it was top notch. We felt so safe, clean and comfortable. We are taking notes on all of the amazing decor for our house. We also were traveling on a road trip with our dog and toddler. Scott had everything we needed for our son and our dog loved roaming on the pasture. I honestly cannot recommend this place enough!"

Its a smart house, so everything is updated accordingly. They had eveything you could possibly need. They thought of everything. The decore, thier personal notes left around the house, the bath and body works wallflowers, snacks to eat, and wonderful smelling soaps, it was all so personal! I can not stress how incredible our stay was. The host was very accommodating and had great hospitality. It was also perfect for our puppy. She had her own space in the mud room.

We expected a nice place to stay, but honestly I think this is the best Airbnb I have ever stayed in (and I have stayed in a lot, throughout the US and Europe)!
The house is fully stocked to keep children and adults entertained. My daughter instantly gravitated towards the game shelf, which was quickly abandoned when she saw the air hockey table. We had plans to play every game, but who can stay inside when there is such a beautiful area to play outside? We were able to explore the farm and buildings and go for nice walks around the field. Our time there was too short to experience it all. We will be back!"

Stayed with kids","Scott and Jane have created a sparkling clean beautiful oasis on the prairie. They are amazing hosts and have thought of every detail to make the home comfortable and welcoming, down to the awesome blow dryer, yoga mat and hotel-quality towels. They offered very clear communication in booking. We stayed with our two children, who loved exploring the beautiful and inspiring property and had a chance to experience a Nebraska summer's freedom to roam around, catch fireflies, make s'mores on the fire pit, play on the deck, pick mulberries and learn about the incredible variety of birds that live in the nearby trees. The house itself is absolutely gorgeous (and, for this working mom, the coffee maker is top notch!) with the most beautiful bathrooms and very comfortable bedrooms. The kitchen is a dream. It is pristinely clean and Scott takes extra steps to keep it sanitized during the pandemic. We enjoyed every minute of our experience on this property and cannot wait to return. Our children cried genuine tears when we left and we spent the morning of check out taking photos of various trees and barns for their scrapbooks so they wouldn't ever forget -- at their request (they are 4 and 7 years old). I would give Scott and Jane 10 stars if I could for what they have so lovingly created and restored. It is worth whatever extra miles it takes you off the Interstate. The experience of this place is a gift."

There isn't a single thing that Scott hasn't thought out when setting up the space and we were blown away by the fully stocked pantry with everything from s'more supplies to a variety of coffee and teas. Then there was the amazing selection of games and kids colouring supplies that our children dived on and were happily distracted by while we unloaded. The house was also spotless and the design and layout were thoughtful and stylish. Then there is the property...such a special piece of land with incredible beauty and history and now a wonderful veggie garden that is taking shape. We wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else when we're in Nebraska."

The minifridge had six water bottles in it which I went through. The only complaint would be a weird running water sound coming through the ceiling vents. Not sure if that's a normal issue with the type of heating that was present in the building or not. Overall the house was clean and met my needs."

Stayed over a week","This is a great short-term place to stay. I stayed for 6 weeks which was too long in my opinion to go without access to a kitchen. There is that ""homey"" atmosphere which is nice. I would just check beforehand to make sure that breakfast is in fact included. The only other drawback is that you can't lock the bedroom door from the outside."

Stayed one night","Skip the hotel and stay here. Lovely old home, sparkling clean and gracious host. We left early and missed breakfast. Will plan better next time. Hastings is a nice place to explore, close to I-70 and the shortcut to Colorado Springs if you enjoy getting off the freeway like we do. Seriously, it’s a great place to stay. One flight of stairs but the use of the living room and the coffee station make up for it."

I arrived fairly late, so I didn’t explore Hastings, but it was a sizeable town with many shops, banks, and even a DunknDonuts.
My upstairs room was spotless, as was the adjacent bathroom. I sleep hot so the ceiling fan was an added bonus!
A hot breakfast with a nice Keurig coffee bar was included, and that made my day! Outside the room was a microwave and mini fridge in case you brought your own.
I highly recommend Joni’s place!"

The bathroom is extremely small but that’s how older homes are.
Plenty of linens and towels. Omar, it would be good to add towel hangers, perhaps in the bedroom as you enter the bathroom. Not a big deal…. It was one block. From St. Cecelia’s Church which is where our event was . This would be perfect for wedding guests at this church.
Highly recommend!!! Nice job, Omar on making this older home beautiful and cozy."

The beds were incredibly comfortable with the softest sheets and blankets ever. Lots of board games and stuff to do. Only 2 chairs at the table but it worked out ok. The bedrooms are all attached but very spacious and doors to seperate them. Host was incredibly helpful and even offered to bring a pack and play for our baby. Would definitely stay again if we are ever in the area.

It not only save us money and also precious traveling time. Jennifer always responded my messages within a couple of minutes.
