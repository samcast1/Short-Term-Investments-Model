Stayed with kids","I would stay at this location over a hotel any day of the week. Chad's rental was clean, well thought out with decor and arrangement, and nicely renovated. He was always responsive. Did I mention it was clean :P? We are so used to having to clean things when we stay anywhere...this was highly refreshing."

Stayed with a pet","The house was exactly like the pictures, everything was spotless, and the kitchen had everything you could ask for. Spacious backyard, relaxing firepit and just a short walk into town! Chad suggested a few things for us to try in town (lunch at Snappy's and the cop car ride) and we had a blast. Everyone we met was so nice!
We would definitely love to come back and stay again."

Stayed with a pet","Perfect! One of my favorite stays and experiences with a host. Chad immediately confirmed my reservation. Permitted me to enter when I arrived a tad before check-in. The house was spotless, tastefully decorated pulling from the Mayberry theme, and the southern charm of the local town into the interior design. It's spacious, open, and has everything, e.g. an awesome floor fan. It was wonderfully cool when I arrived. No house is directly across the street, easy Door Dash, strong Wi-fi, large TV. Well-groomed, large backyard for dog, kids, games. Breakfast nook is inviting. Deck is high from ground, but a gate at top allowed the dog lay in the sun, securely. There's 10 steps on deck. I would've loved to spend more time in this charming space and town. A rooster nearby crows, but didn't bother me. Chad was polite, responsive, concise, and available, but did not over-text with check-ins/rules. He communicated necessities, then left me to enjoy his space and contact him if needed.⭐️"

Stayed with kids","Charming Home with Local Flair
We had a wonderful stay at this charming Airbnb! The host was incredibly friendly and made sure we had everything we needed throughout our visit. The house was spotlessly clean, and we appreciated the lovely local decorations that added character to the space.
Our kids absolutely adored the cozy kitchen nook, and spotting a groundhog in the backyard and the neighbor's chickens was a memorable part of their trip.
However, the only downside was that the bed was not as comfortable as we had hoped. We're accustomed to sleeping on a Tempur-pedic mattress, so the spring mattress provided was a bit of an adjustment for us. Despite this minor inconvenience, we thoroughly enjoyed our time here and would definitely consider staying again in the future. Highly recommend for a cozy and authentic local experience!"

The house is very charming with a lot of classic character while having modern amenities. The tv and wifi were really simple to operate/log in. The kitchen is well equipped. Chad puts a lot of thought into providing some simple items like coffee, filters, and laundry pods. The street felt very safe for walking for exercise alone, and all the neighbors I passed were friendly. We would definitely recommend this house to friends or stay here again ourselves. Thank you for a wonderful stay."

Stayed with a pet","Hay house is a cute little place that is in a convenient neighborhood with other small homes. There is evidence of upgrading of homes and new building in the area but it was quiet (we heard a rooster) and felt very safe. We made a quick trip for a wedding and would have loved to have more time to explore the area! We would definitely book Hay house again! There were 3 of us, so the queen bed and full sized bed worked fine for us. We had a small, older dog with us and he enjoyed exploring the spacious back yard. The host, Chad, was very responsive and helpful."

Stayed with a pet",My parents and I stayed here while traveling from Michigan back to NE NC during the holidays. The house is absolutely stunning and was pristine! All of the holiday decorations were a nice touch - especially the Christmas tree! The backyard was huge and our 2 yr old goldendoodle got lots of good sniffs in. The view of the mountains from the front porch was a wonderful surprise. Chad was an excellent host and provided lots of recommendations on things to do in the area and provided everything we could have needed in the home. We especially enjoyed walking down Main St. and having lunch at Leon’s Burger Express. I’m definitely looking forward to coming back just to stay in the house and work remotely - it was such a peaceful retreat. Of course also to check out the wineries and get more burgers :) Thank you for a wonderful stay in Mt. Airy!

Stayed with a pet","Cutest place ever!!! They have created a little oasis! We were only there for a couple of days but definitely could have stayed longer. So much to do! We went to a few wineries ( Round Peak Vineyard was our fav) , hiked, and walked around town. It was off season so very quiet. The cottage had everything we needed- we cooked a few meals, beds were comfy, our dog was super happy! Very Pet friendly! We also took her everywhere! The Loaded Goat restaurant let us sit inside and the hostess/ waitress was the BEST!!
Cottage is perfect- seriously perfect- walked my dog and felt very safe (even at night) Chad was one of the best hosts we have stayed with!!! We will definitely stay there again!! 15 stars out of 10😊😂"

Stayed with a pet","I had a incredible stay at the beautiful little place on Hay St. It was spotless and had everything I needed to make my dog and I comfortable. The house has a sweet little breakfast nook and my pup and I felt right at home. Traveling solo with a dog can be a little tricky and this place was the perfect stop for me to get some much need rest and relaxation. I didn't have time to tour the Andy Griffith museum but it is on my to do list for next time. Book here in Mt. Airy, AKA Mayberry and you will not be disappointed. This is a perfect place to stop for a couple, small family, or a solo traveler like myself."

Very quiet area with very little traffic.
Fun to sit at the table and watch the ground hogs play in the yard and the squirrels playing in the trees.
The kitchen was well equipped.
We absolutely loved the interior woodwork. Not sure if it was part of the remodel or not. It did however give us some ideas for our own homes.
Thank you Chad for being an excellent host and we appreciated your suggestions. We are glad we were ""front door"" tenants!
We will be back!"

Stayed with kids","Our visit to Mt. Airy was made even more wonderful by our ""home away from home.""
Chad's communication was excellent from my first inquiry!
The house has a ""Mayberry"" feel, which contributed greatly to our peaceful vacation. It has a nice front porch and a new deck on the back. The house is in a very quiet neighborhood. We could sit outside and listen to the birds. We even occasionally heard a rooster, which added to the Mayberry experience!
The house itself was exceptionally clean and absolutely charming. From the beadboard on the ceilings that reminded me of my grandmother's home, to the beautiful wood floors, the home was so comfortable and welcoming! It also had the convenience of modern appliances. The best of both worlds!
It's close to Main St. and all the Mayberry destinations. We can't wait to go back!"

We got to set on the front porch and also the deck and have a glass of wine and enjoy nature. This is also a good location if you are thinking of doing the wine tour as it is centrally located. It is also very close to downtown, however, we drove as it would be a good 20 minute walk.
We would definitely recommend this home and location. If we were to go back to Mount Airy area we would stay here again."

The house was spotless, well appointed and very comfortable. the decor is updated while still paying homage to the original features and was very tasteful and restful. nit huge but every space is used to best advantage so felt very spacious and airy. Fully (and I mean FULLY) equipped kitchen with tons of storage and the MOST adorable dining nook with lots of sunshine through the many windows. Everything was beautiful and very convenient laid out. Great for our long weekend but I'd also recommend it for an extended stay! Chad was sooooo helpful with recommendations and answered any questions quickly and with the details we needed.

Rooms are large, except bathroom. Sofa, also a pullout bed, was supportive but soft. All chairs were well made & comfortable. King bed was softer; queen, more firm. Ample nice linens. The kitchen well stocked for cooking. Lighting is good in house. Can be 3 private bedrooms each w/direct access to bathroom--Living room closes off from other rooms. Large dining table can be for 6. Hosts thought of everything-there are many comfort items such as first aid, Kleenex, umbrella, DVDs, games, recycle info, folding chairs to set in back yard for great view of wooded ravine, basic seasoning & food items. It is an up-&-coming neighborhood, we felt safe. Very nice young lady renting apartment behind the house. Next door is being remodeled (quietly). Great hosts!

Stayed one night","John & Emily have a very nice place. I give them a 5 star rating. It felt like being at home. Very nicely kept with amenities in the kitchen and bathroom (among other things). I also enjoyed the keurig coffee maker (even though they had a drip-brew coffee maker available). They also had it nicely decorated inside for the general holidays (Christmas). And ..they left the lights on....for my arrival [outside entrance light and inside lamps with soft-light]. Lastly, I would say, as a huge benefit, that I was able to park in the driveway - literally 5 feet away from the side-door to enter the kitchen area. This made it easy to unload and load my vehicle with items and luggage that I wanted inside with me and to not leave in my vehicle overnight.
This was my 2nd time renting with Airbnb during the last 12 months - and I would 100% recommend staying at John & Emily's place in Mt. Airy, NC.

Thank you for having a wonderful place to stay

Two large bedrooms plus a roomy kitchen, dining room and living room make for a relaxing stay. You are within just a few blocks of Main Street ""Mayberry"" and you'll love the conveniences of everything being close by."

Stayed with kids","This was a good stay - very close to local attractions and easy driving distance to many others. We were in town for a weekday wedding so anything else we did was a bonus, but there were several things closed on the Monday and even Wednesday we had available to explore and pretty much everything other than restaurants in town closes by 5p, so just pay attention to the days & hours of what you’re going for :)
The house itself, though definitely older and seemingly appointed specifically for Air BnB use, was clean, spacious, and peaceful.
The hosts were thorough, friendly, and informative. We appreciated all the ideas on what to do and where to eat. The art walk was my favorite :) As other reviewers have mentioned, there’s updating happening on the street - the house next door had a broken out window so was a little wary to pull up next to at night but we noticed construction workers there the next day and all was well during our 4 night stay. We would probably stay again!"

Quiet street. One of the best times was playing games (which we brought) as a family in the dining room while drinking coffee and listening to songs from the 40's on their record player. It felt like we had gone back in time! We also loved watching the Andy Griffith DVDs available while we were there. Wonderful stay.

The house looked exactly as pictured on the inside. We loved staying on the quiet street and that we were able to walk right up to town. Also loved that they had the Andy Griffith dvd collection. The house smelled so good when we walked in the door they really do take great care of the place and went out of their way to make it feel so homey. Would definitely stay here again!

We absolutely adored this cottage! It was squeaky clean and more well-stocked than any AirBnB I’ve rented. You can look around and see the forethought in every little detail. It was such a comfortable stay. We enjoyed watching a couple of Andy Griffith episodes from the DVD box set in bed! We also loved playing old albums on the record player—so fitting in the old style space. :)"

We have two little ones and it checked all of our boxes for an overnight stay on our way to the beach. It’s on a quiet little street, the doors aren’t creaky even though it’s an older home (essential for sneaking out after the baby goes to bed!), the curtains are wonderful for pulling shut and having a nice dark room. We took a little walk in the morning to burn off some energy before getting back on the road and ran into some older gentleman at the top of the hill with vintage police cars. My oldest got arrested, lol. They were very friendly and he got a kick out of that. Thanks so much John and Emily!"

Stayed a few nights","Our two-night stay was actually a stop-over on our way to the Blue Ridge Music Center - (a must-see). The cottage was very clean and comfortable - and close to town. Hosts John and Emily went above and beyond to provide all the amenities for a comfortable stay. Their recommendation that we take the squad car ride from Wally's Garage was an excellent choice for an interesting afternoon. Our driver, Alan was not only entertaining, but enlightened us with a brief history of Mt. Airy and its favorite son, Andy Griffith. We recommend The Mustard Seed for lunch. Down-home fare - reasonable prices.

They did a great job decorating and outfitting the home with furniture, bedding, and plush bath towels(many rentals include bath towels but they are always too small, too thin & not nearly enough of them.) Spent our evening sipping wine on the front porch and our morning sipping coffee in the same spot. Loved the Andy Griffith decor inside and we even watched some of the DVD's. The home is within walking distance to the quaint town of Mount Airy and childhood home of Andy Griffith. Lots of shopping, restaurants, breweries, and ice cream. The Andy Griffith Museum is close by too and we toured that and Wally's Garage as well. I definitely give this home & area 5 stars."

The house itself is very comfortable and clean. It is located on a small street with some of the surrounding homes currently undergoing renovations. To be honest when we first approached the home I was a little taken aback by the looks of the home next door with broken windows and 2x4's on the front porch. However, once settled inside and I understood that homes were being restored, any uneasy feelings I initially had were dismissed.
I would recommend this home to anyone looking to stay in the downtown area."

The house was very clean and cozy. Check in was super easy, and the home was located fairly close to all of the Mayberry attractions. The location to Wally’s service station is wonderful.
The surrounding area isn’t very appealing currently due to neighboring homes being renovated, but this is no fault of the owners. Overall, this home is a good choice and good value for a stay in “Mayberry”."

We sampled some delicious fresh eggs and took advantage of our run of the property. There are well manicured mown trails to reach all 80 acres with a beautiful pond that has a bench and a picnic table for some quiet reflection or a peaceful lunch. Make sure to say hi to Fluffy by the cow shed. He looks like a great mouser and is an exceedingly friendly cat. The gazebo near the house looks like a wonderful spot for a small wedding reception or a nice fire on a cool fall evening. And those views. Wow! The sunrises are spectacular and the cabin is well positioned to take advantage of them. I would highly recommend and definitely plan to return. 5*+.

Very difficult to read the house number at night (maybe make it larger and reflective to help with that) the address sign was quite small. Had to figure out how to get to 123 as driveway wasn’t paved.
Other than that, totally enjoyed the inside of the house, decor, amenities and everything."

Every detail was thought out from the sewing kit provided to the extra tooth brush to the snacks and delicious coffee. We stayed for one night after a long day of traveling and just needed a place to shower and rest our heads. This surpassed all expectations to the point where, if we were to pass through again, we would 100% stay again! The host was very attentive and provided us with all necessary information before arrival.

Found price adequate until the host Glenn tryed to blindside us by trying to charge us for damage that was already at the house. Light damage that We didnt say anything to airbnb because it didnt affect our stay. Neighbors were noisy and dogs barking all night keeping my kids up. Typical trailer park.. Will not return. Followed all of host’s instructions and still he Is trying to get an absurd amount of money for cleaning we weren’t required to do and damage that was literally there when we arrived. (Scuffs to floor and furniture)

Glenn is very responsive and also gave some great suggestions for things to do. The trailer is in a tiny park and there is nothing to do onsite, but he did provide some board games which was a cute little addition. Glenn had snacks and water provided which came in handy because we came in on Thanksgiving Day and all the grocery stores were closed. This is the perfect location for a couple or family who like to get away from the house and explore."

It is beautifully decorated, quality furniture, spotless, comfortable, quiet, and has everything you’ll need and more. Price was unbelievably low. I’d gladly move into Glenn’s place! Asked Glenn a question through Airbnb platform and he replied in just a few moments. Bedrooms are at opposite ends of the unit so privacy is great if both bedrooms are used. Beds are comfortably medium/firm. Snacks, bottled water, thick towels, no unexpected costs or surprises. Will definitely stay at Glenn’s next time I head to Myrtle Beach!"

The living room offers space for playing board games, watching television, or good conversation. The house is close to town and restaurants. Highly recommend Glenn's place."

The shower was very cleanly as well as we did get stuck in a freak 🌧 storm. It isn't the Luxurious places that you see online but it was beautiful on the inside and we loved it

Their home sit slightly on a small hillside overlooking a pond across from their property. In the evening you can hear the coyotes across the way . The backyard has a great seating area around a fire ring with a grill . This listing is new we may have been the 4th family inside everything was neat and tidy and came with snacks ! The host is very responsive if you have any questions. I would definitely recommend checking this place out . It’s far enough away but yet close enough to be in town in 15-20 minutes if you need anything.

We enjoyed sitting out on the front porch, drinking our coffee & watching our fur baby Snoopy enjoy strolling around the fenced in front yard. The kitchen was awesome! The living room, bedrooms & bathrooms were cozy & very clean. Tonya left us maps & brochures to explore Mt. Airy/Mayberry & we used them too! So great taking an Andy Griffith tour around 'Mayberry'! There are many wonderful nature things to see, plus vineyards! We enjoyed dinner at The Loaded Goat, Tonya has recommendations of places to eat & we followed her advice! We HIGHLY recommend visiting Mt. Airy & staying with Tonya, she is a wonderful host!
P.S. Snoopy LOVED Red Brush Charmer, didn't want to leave! If your fur baby or child feel comfortable, that says a LOT about a place! :D Thank you Tonya!"

Stayed a few nights","What a lovely, cozy, charming home! I went for a few days of rest and refilling and to plan our next homeschool term. I LOVED sitting on the front porch with books in my lap and coffee on the table and being able to look across the nearby fields and see clouds scudding across the sky; also loved hearing and watching the cows. In the mornings there was a very enthusiastic rooster who greeted the day with such joy - and who was just far enough away to be charming. :) My bed was soft, comfy and clean. The kitchen was lovely, clean and bright. It was close enough to Mt. Airy that I could visit a bagel shop that our daughter had recommended - yum! - but far enough out that it felt private and quiet. The road in front of the house is sometimes loud and busy, but the action seems to be concentrated at only certain times of the day. Lovely home, decorated with care; loved the wall art and cute signs - some of which I have in my own home. Hope to be back."

The space worked out very nicely for five of us ... although we only stayed one night. My family just kept saying how 'perfect' it was. We looked into booking on our trip home but it wasn't available. We will definitely stay again on a future trip. Thank you Tonya for an enjoyable stay and a beautifully kept home.

Stayed with a pet","Need a place to stay near Mount Airy??
Consider Tonya’s home away from home.
Perfect three bedroom home for a family to stay in. In our case, two sisters driving our Snowbird folks, age 87 and 90 home to Ohio from Florida. Since Covid, we have found Airbnbs much better of accommodations than hotels, when it comes to avoiding cooties.
Suggest staying two+ nights to cross all the fun sights of Mayberry USA off your bucket list.
We enjoyed our breakfast at Snappy’s Diner and shopping next door at Opie’s Candy Shop.
Highly recommend Tonya’s Airbnb.

Airy downtown is really cute with great restaurants, a music store, a soda shop, candy shop, etc. We were in the audience for the live radio show at Earle Theatre which was fun. We also visited Pilot Mountain and hiked to the top overlook areas. Back at the house we took advantage of the front porch and back deck. The fenced in front yard was great for our little dogs. Would stay again!"

It’s a very simple, well-appointed home and that’s just what we needed for a one night stay. I liked that she listed the local restaurants and grocery stores. After a long day of driving it’s good to have a little help with where to get dinner. For you city people (like us) take time to check out the abundance of stars in the sky. I think we could even see the Milky Way."

The host are easy and quick to communicate with. The home is exactly as described but somehow 100x more than what we could have dreamed of. It is close to town and all attractions of Mt. Airy and Pilot Mountain but nestled off of a quiet country road. Our favorite part of this home were the views. We would get up early in the morning and sit in the rocking chairs on the front porch to watch the sunrise over the mountains. I cannot recommend this place enough. We will definitely be back!!

The home is well stocked with all essentials. There are nice touches, such as luggage holders in each room, comfortable blankets, extra pillows. Very quaint with attention to detail.
The host is very communicative and responds within minutes. It is located on a busy road but it doesn’t take away from the beautiful surroundings."

You were thoughtful with the small touches around the house, from a well stocked kitchen to providing additional cleaning supplies if needed. The pull through driveway was very nice as well. The wifi worked great and loved the added tv service you had for the guests!

Stayed with a pet","Tonya's place is lovely. It is in a beautiful country setting and convenient to visiting Mount Airy/""Mayberry"", as well as the highway for further travel. The beds were extremely comfortable, kitchen well appointed, and the whole place had a cozy ""home away from home"" feeling. It was especially nice to be able to bring our pup along and he loved the fenced in yard. We didn't want to leave but were on our way to visit family for Christmas. We especially loved all the extra Christmas decor throughout the home. Hope to be back soon and spend more time!"

On top of that we were going to a family wedding and needed additional time to get ready. Tonya was amazing and got my family and I in two hours ahead of check in time. I can't thank her enough for that.
We had a small problem at the house around 1 in the morning so I sent her a message hoping she would see it when she woke up. Nope, Tonya was awake and had her husband come over to fix our problem. The house was beautiful, clean, and it is everything she said it was. I hope to come back to Tonya's house when we come back down to visit family again."

Stayed one night","Really cute place with all I needed for an overnight stay while in town for a meeting. The place was clean and tidy, and they've done a nice job making it feel welcoming. Two issues to be aware of, noted in a few other reviews, and may not matter to most. 1) driveway is rough as described, but also has a narrow entrance between two stone walls and you can't see from the street what the parking/turnaround situation is; there are 4-5 tight spaces but it's fine. Also the street is very busy and on a slight curve (didn't want to park there overnight). 2) the bed was hot - I don't know if there is a plastic cover on the mattress or some kind of topper that holds heat, but I could only get sort of comfortable by cranking AC way down and being hot on the bottom and cold on the top."

The kitchen was so well stocked that I could have made our meals there if I had wanted to. Everything was spotless and well supplied with anything needed for our stay. We stayed for 2 nights but could have stayed longer. I recommend this unit if you plan a visit to Mt. Airy!."

Can’t say enough good things about the place, and the hosts.
Easy to book and find. Great value for such meticulously maintained and simultaneously comfortable accommodations. Very private once you settle in. Couldn’t be located any closer to all points of interest.
Communicated on occasion with the hosts about minor administrative things. Very responsive. I think if there were a problem of any significance it wouldn’t have been a problem long.
Much loved character still visible in the home. They’ve done a great job minimizing updates and restorations, and it was really a pleasure to call it home for a night or two."

The order tenants were a bit noisy, but that was to be expected during the super bowl, and since it's on a main street there was a fair amount of traffic noise in the morning. The space was very clean, and the communication was top notch. Highly recommend for a stay in Mount Airy."

My one thing was the location. I arrived very late at night and alone, so being a women I am naturally in a fearful mindset with those circumstances in a new place, but the driveway and area made me on edge. I would have appreciated a warning about the driveway since I was in a rental car and extra nervous about any damage. It was very bumpy and uneven and a tight squeeze down."

Everything exceeded our expectations!

I wish we could have stayed longer and had time to just relax in the space.
I hope to go back to the area and would definitely stay here again!
This trip we were a party of four, two couples.
The only thing I wish was different about the space was that you didn’t have to enter the bedroom to get to the bathroom.
This is not a problem for a family, but a little awkward during the night for two couples.
Other than being surprised when we arrived to see that, everything else was lovely!
My boyfriend and I slept on the sofa bed and it was very comfortable for us. In reading the reviews no one mentions the sofa so I thought it was important to include this info for those who might be a partly of more than two.
Great location!! Extremely walkable to EVERYTHING we wanted to see on our short visit.
The loft is very clean, comfortable and stylish without being overdone.
I can’t wait to return! 😊"

Stayed a few nights","I usually stay at hotels for business travel, but when I saw the price of the one I'd usually stay at in the area (a national chain), I balked, and since I use Airbnb several times a year, checked out listings for Mount Airy. I was amazed to see such a reasonable price for Brandon and Taylor's ""loft,"" which, in fact, I would characterize more as an apartment. The space was several times larger than a room at a hotel, not to mention it had a separate kitchen, dining nook, living room, and nice bedroom with a nice-sized bathroom. Everything was clean, it was well stocked (as I typically iron pants, etc., I was glad to see it had an iron and ironing board), and with a TV in the living room and a TV in the bedroom, I had everything I needed. At the end of the business day, it was great to relax on the big couch in the living room with tall ceilings and its wood walls that made the place feel warm. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat if in the area on business!"

They were very quick on responding to questions I had along with being knowledgeable of the surrounding area. They created a list of places I should go to and see, and it didn’t disappoint. Most places were walking distance and if not walking distance, then no more than 5 minutes of driving.
The grounds and place I stayed was just as the pictures and descriptions portrayed on the app. It was more than enough for what I needed at a low cost.
I would recommend staying and would stay again when I come back through that town."

Stayed with kids","We chose to stay at Catherine's as a stop along I-77. The price was reasonable and the experience was unique.
Catherine's place was magical! We settled into the older farm cottage and headed over to the suggested property to get a glimpse of bison. The kids enjoyed seeing them up close from inside the car. Then, we went back to the cottage to play in the stream. (Recommend bringing water shoes for the kids, as we spotted two pieces of glass). Later in the evening, the bison came running down the hill and grazed for the rest of the night in our yard. They even came pretty close to the front porch!
Inside the house, the kitchen was well-equipped and comfortable. We all found the beds to be great and provided a wonderful night's sleep before continuing on I-77. The children's bedrooms are very close to the bathroom and kitchen. I'd recommend a sound machine to drown out some of the noise.
Overall, we loved our stay and would do it again in a heartbeat."

While the bison did not come to see us, our hosts were gracious enough to allow us to walk on their beautiful property and guided to where they thought the bison might be. We found them peacefully grazing and enjoyed watching them for a while. We were lucky enough to see a couple of calves. Fantastic, relaxing stay!"

Group trip","Absolutely BEAUTIFUL, the house and the property! We actually had a bison roaming the yard around the house all morning. My husband painted it in the yard. The house is as described, its well maintained and very clean. It is decorated very elegantly. We brought in groceries and made a large breakfast for 5, the house was stocked with all the cookware you'll need. We had our breakfast out on the large front porch in the sun. It was a great view from the porch and of course, the bison was a plus.
For persons with physical disabilities (note: host informed me before booking): 1) large step into the house from back door, very very steep for lifting wheelchair 2) no grab bars anywhere. There is enough room inside to move about comfortably in a chair.
Catherine was very responsive to all messages I sent. We definitely will book again when we are in the area.

Unfortunately, we were disappointed that we didn't get to see any bison. However, this house is well worth the stay. It has everything that you need to be comfortable, specifically for a family with kids. We were able to be on our way in the morning with the car at 100% charge for a long drive. We will definitely consider this Airbnb again the next time we are driving through. Maybe we will get lucky to see some bison! Absolutely book this home if you are on the fence.

In the early mornings you can see the bison feeding in the pasture and it’s quite remarkable and relaxing. She works hard to anticipate guests needs and it shows. The placed is priced very appropriately. The kitchen is well equipped and clean, the bathroom is a good size and has plenty of clean towels, the bedrooms are clean and comfortable enough. It has everything you want from a good B&B: good price, great host, peace and quiet, cleanliness, and Bison 🦬! What else could you want… maybe more days 😄"

Catherine was easy to communicate with and responded quickly. Her cottage is very well stocked with anything you could possibly need for a fun family vacay, including children's toys, scooters, books, board games, cornhole, etc.
We really enjoyed seeing the Bison coming into the pasture out front in the mornings and evenings, with a few coming by the cottage munching away on the grass off the porch nearby. The fresh eggs she provided were so delicious!
Mt. Airy downtown is only 20 min. away and her online guest book is spot on with lots of fun things to see and do, plus great places to dine. We especially enjoyed hiking Pilot and Stone Mts., The Thursday Night Wine Club tasting with horderves @ the Old North State Winery downtown, and dining @ 13 Bones.

We had many great experiences and plan to return!
Thanks, Catherine :-)"

The decor is perfect, simple, inspirational, and homey. I loved so many aspects of this stay. The hosts provided plenty of towels, washcloths, and toilet paper so you never have to fear of running out of those important supplies. Having a washer and dryer available was also a great touch, so you don't have to return home with any dirty laundry! The host brought us fresh eggs, which were delicious! The bison were amazing, at one point we counted 35 in the yard! It was a delight to sit on the porch and watch them graze! The property is incredibly beautiful and peaceful. Plenty of outdoor seating options and corn hole was provided for play. I would highly recommend this airbnb and hope to return myself. I also highly recommend an easy beautiful nearby hiking trail, ""Horne Creek Trail"" followed by incredible ice cream at ""Scoops""."

After staying here for the weekend we realized there are so many extra details. We arrived with fresh eggs and water in the fridge, snacks on the table, and even items to cook muffins. Plenty of pots and pans for cooking. Having a Keurig and several different coffees, teas, and hot chocolate to choose from was great! The cottage was very clean, organized and comfortable. Do not let having one bathroom deter you from booking. The bathroom is huge with lots of counter space. The weather was a little chilly at night so we used the firepit. Wood was provided for us. Linens were very clean. Cleaning supplies were available if needed. There's not one item I can think of that we needed that was not available! We had. fantastic stay and hope to be back soon!!"

Fridge was stocked with fresh eggs and bottle water to take on our walks. I thoroughly enjoyed all the different flavors of coffee which I usually don’t buy because my husband doesn’t enjoy them. We got to see the buffalo each day, and as a hobby photographer, enjoyed taking pictures of them. Questions were answered immediately. There were plenty of toys around for kids to play with, games available to play, and movies. Our teenage son enjoyed being able to get into Netflix and Hulu. This place is amazing!

Alice ensured that we had everything we needed and was responsive to our questions. We arrived to the home with a few lights on and music playing. The refrigerator was stocked with water and there was coffee for the coffee maker and keurig. The house was perfectly decorated with a “Mayberry” vibe and every wall made me think of growing up watching Andy Griffith. Alice even left travel bottles of shampoo in the bathroom. Although we have not stayed at many Airbnb locations, this one is definitely tied with another as the best. If our travels bring us back to “Mayberry” our first choice for a place to stay will be in this home."

Stayed a few nights","Great location! My family and I had a Great vacation! Great things to do and explore! Alice was super responsive until my wife reached out with a question about the washer not working correctly. Then we didn’t hear anything out of her. However, she hadn’t checked her inbox messages on the AirB&B message so, maybe she didn’t receive them. I don’t know. Alice was Very Responsive until No response about the washer and our check-out. Overall it was a Great experience and we had a GREAT vacation stay!!! Thank you Alice for the opportunity for us to stay in the Dew Drop Inn! God bless!"

Stayed a few nights","This home was beautifully decorated! Alice put a lot of time and thought in to each piece of decor. It felt like home and it was exactly how it was described on the advertisement details.
Even though the house sits in town it doesn’t feel like that at all with the trees and the privacy it felt like we were out in the country.
The amenities exceeded expectations! Alice has cold waters in the refrigerator and some snack crackers in a jar in the kitchen. Complimentary shampoo, soap etc in case anyone had forgotten to pack those things.
Plenty of cookware and plates etc.
We utilized the gas grill on the patio.
This trip was amazing and I can’t wait to go back again!
When we had a few questions Alice was prompt to reply 😀"

Stayed a few nights","We, along with another couple, stayed at the Dew Drop Inn while attending a local fiddlers convention. The house was easy to find, and with the code that Alice had provided, check-in was a breeze. The house was spacious, neat, and very well equipped. The kitchen was especially well outfitted, which was terrific. Our only disappointment was that there was lawn mowing right at dinner time on two consecutive days, so we were unable to enjoy the nice backyard. But of course, that wasn’t really Alice’s fault! I am sure we would like to come back."

Stayed a few nights","We came to Mayberry to reminisce about a simpler time and as soon as we drove up to Alice’s house that was our first experience. A large farm with a gentleman out plowing his field and the sounds of roosters in the background.
The house was larger than we expected with 2 bedrooms on opposite sides of the house. The beds were clean and comfortable with ample pillows! The bathrooms were large with plenty of space to lay your toiletries out on the counter and drawers abundant! The amazingly large kitchen was stocked with all the necessities for a home away from home stay including a jar of delicious night time snacks! The house was very spacious for 4 adults and close to Mayberry downtown! We hated to leave but we will certainly be back!"

Stayed one night","The house itself is very nice. There's a lot of cute little touches. The decor's great. One thing: the floors are uneven so if you use help to walk, it could be an issue. The rest of the house was nice clean overall. However, both the washer and dryer were full when we arrived. There were also dishes in the dishwasher. We let Alice know about the washer and dryer as we were going to use it and she did offer to come remove the laundry. So that was nice. But as those are listed as amenities, it shouldn't have happened. She provided travel bottles of shampoo, water, and snacks and that was nice too. The street is pretty weird. It's easy to miss. The house is surrounded by a run down house, trailer, and messy area in general. But felt safe. Theres a nice patio area in the back. Great for listening to the crowing rosters and traffic from the nearby road. 🫤 It's in great proximity to all the Andy Griffith attractions.
Communication was fast but we encountered some honestly issues with Alice"

The house is decorated very nicely and the curtains add a homey feel.
I personally wouldn't consider walking to downtown Mt Airy due to the absence of sidewalks. The house is located roughly a mile away from the sweet little town of Mt Airy's Main Street.
I would recommend Alice's house and Mt Airy, NC"

Stayed a few nights","Had a sisters weekend with my middle sis. We loved our stay at the Dew Drop Inn! Every detail of the Mt. Airy vibe exists in this wonderful home. The beds were super comfortable. Coming from big cities, we enjoyed the peace and quiet having coffee and breakfast on the back patio. You don't even need to bring your own bottled water. We will definitely be back."

The king bed was great for me, my husband, and toddler. There was a really nice produce stand just a few minute walk away. We will definitely remember this place for future trips down south."

Place was as stated and shown in the listing, very comfortable, convenient. Biggest issue which was a disappointing one for me, she was still there cleaning after check in, wasn’t wearing a mask despite saying committed to enhanced cleaning. My mom is higher risk and we used Airbnb in hopes to avoid any shared air. Otherwise, this place was great- she was responsive to communications."
