Group trip","We had a great stay! The location is perfect, you get privacy while being a short drive from anything you need. Easy access to highway 44 also. Kitchen was stocked with pots, pans, utensils and had plenty of space to cook and eat. The entire house was super clean and the A/C worked incredibly well! Rebekah was extremely responsive if we needed anything. We will definitely be back if we stay in the area again!"

It has fresh paint, pristine towels and linens.
It is very well stocked, and she left a very sweet Welcome package.
There was also a great selection of Teas and Coffees.
The House, is decorated very tastefully and has two separate living rooms, which is nice.
I highly recommend this place.
It also is very easy to get to, right off of I-44."

We stay in AirBNBs all overteh country and Jamie was incredibly thoughtful putting this home together - best of any home we've stayed in. She left so may wonderful items that might get forgotten, from shaving cream to great coffee flavorings for the coffee bar. She also outfitted the home with tons of great seasonal decor which made it super homey. All of the super soft throws throughout the house were also great to stay cozy on beautiful fall days!
Definitely recommend!"

Stayed with kids","We rented the cabin for my daughter’s wedding. It allowed us to have the whole family in one spot. The house was beautiful, equipped with everything we needed for the weekend plus more. Judy allowed us to check in at 2:00 pm instead of the normal time of 4:00 so that we could start decorating and getting ready for the wedding at the pavilion. On the wedding night we had two guests that had a long drive home and since we only had 8 people in our house Judy allowed us to have let the other two guests stay with no extra charge. She was prompt in answering anytime we needed her and check in and check out was a breeze.
My one and only complaint was that we did find a packet of birth control pills under the pillow in one of the rooms, and some small empty liquor bottles in the couch arm rest of another.
Overall it was a great stay, just thought the cleaning person could’ve been a bit more thorough."

The home was immaculate and had everything you needed that would be in your own home. Every message I sent to her, she responded with in five minutes. She was also VERY accommodating, welcoming, and kind. The only thing I would say is the location is 45 minutes away from the military base, However, I knew that, but still couldn't resist staying there instead of a hotel. The pictures are exactly as it looks in the images. Beautiful home and host!"

Stayed with a pet","This place is stunning, pictures do not do it justice. Our family did something different this year & spent Christmas here. It did not disappoint. All that was missing was the snow to make it the perfect Norman Rockwell picture. Quiet & tranquil at least in the winter. Jim & Judy are the perfect host. They leave you alone but respond almost immediately when you need something. Plenty of games and things to do for kids of any age. Kitchen is 2x the size in the pictures. Large deck on back of the home. I don’t think that picture was shown. My 12 year old daughter absolutely fell in love the back bedroom which had its own bathroom & 2 shower heads. It was tough to get her out of that room to spend time with us. I can’t blame her it was so cozy and private. She’s a twin so he doesn’t get that much privacy at home. I recommend a winter stay it’s the perfect peaceful hideaway."

Please know that the pictures are an understatement of this property, this home is most certainly a 5 star property. The kitchen omg, is certainly a dream kitchen , it’s everything and equipped with everything, soft close drawers, the finest dishes , cooking accessories for what ever dish your preparing. Must I say my family spent most of our time hanging out in this gorgeous kitchen. Dining for18- 20 people , we had a graduation dinner and had plenty of room . The bathrooms which every bedroom has an on suite bathroom. And one downstairs, all the bathrooms were absolutely fabulous, . Mrs Judy had prepared snacks , coffee , teas fresh water in the refrigerator. Also supplied big cozy blankets on her large sectional. Oh did I mention a very nice library in her home. Nice porch and fire pit , Me Judy was the best , responds qu"

Group trip","Judy was quick, responsive and listed her place accurately! The cabinets and supplies were well stocked and the kitchen had nice, newer appliances. The housekeeping team could do a better job at checking to make sure sheets are spotless (They seemed washed, but stained or little pieces of dirt). The large kitchen and dining room made it easy to get ready in the morning while being together with all my girls. The price is a little steep for the place, but Judy was sure to make the place cute and all necessities covered. It’d be nice to have a table top ice maker and extra throw blankets. The extra blankets/quilts provided were pretty old looking (Didn’t want to use those) so we were pretty chilly and the fireplace smelled strongly of propane so we didn’t use it. Thanks for hosting us!"

Stayed with a pet","The Log Cabin is truly EXQUISITE! The home is beyond beautiful, clean, and extremely comfortable. The decor could be photographed for a magazine! Everything you need for a family gathering has been thought of! We are frequent guests on the property because we feel so well taken care of and comfortable! The property is just spectacular! Peaceful, secluded but close enough to town. We enjoy sitting on the front porch and enjoying the beauty of nature all around! Hosts Judy and Jim are so delightful and have created an oasis like no other!! Thank you and we will definitely be back again!!"

Group trip",We really enjoyed having our daughter's wedding at your beautiful venue. We really loved being able to have all of the bridesmaids and groomsmen onsite at the venue the night before the wedding and especially the the night of. I think having the bridesmaids stay together in a house for the whole weekend helped them all to bond and make even more wonderful memories. The same for the groomsmen!! It's such a beautiful venue with a very neat historical story behind how the place was originally created for Donna Douglas (Elly May Clampett from The Beverly Hillbillies). Loved it!

The pictures do not do it justice and the kitchen is one that Gordon Ramsey would be jealous of! Even though these items are important to travelers, their is no substitute for the personal attention Judy so willingly offered. She was able to accommodate us at the end of our stay given that we encountered unforeseen circumstances…she is the best! Needless to say, I would highly recommend this oasis to travelers! ENJOY!!!!"

Stayed one night","Just an absolutely gorgeous house. The kitchen is fit for a chef and was a great place to hang out and enjoy getting a meal ready. The dining room had a giant table that could seat a small army if you're cooking for a large crowd. Everyone slept well in the comfortable beds and the attached bathrooms were nicely adorned. We all had At&t and there wasn't much signal but the internet at the house was speedy and we were able to use wifi calling.
The house was just minutes away from the Cub Creek Science camp where we were all picking up our children the next day. It was great to relax the night before and spend 5 minutes in the car vs 2 hours. We look forward to staying again in the future."

When we arrived, Rolla was everything Judy said, a quiet city/town with friendly people.The Log Cabin is like a home away from home; for family quality time, peaceful and surrounded by nature."

Stayed a few nights","There is only one word to describe this heavenly place - Perfect! Everything was just perfect! Exactly what I needed for a little down time and personal R & R. I arrived in the evening to a chorus of big and little frogs from the lake, whip-poor-will calls, and a beautiful moon to greet me in an otherwise silent forest evening. The cabin is simply magnificent. The photos don't, and couldn't possibly do it justice. I was fortunate enough to meet the hosts, Jim and Judy, and told them that if there had been any way for me to beam the place over to my farm in Illinois, they would have been left with an empty foundation! I loved the place that much! Since I was traveling alone, I didn't even begin to take advantage of all that the cabin and the property have to offer for a larger group - especially for folks who like to cook. That kitchen is astounding! And Judy and Jim are two of the most wonderful people and accommodating hosts that you will ever meet. Don't hesitate to book your stay or event with them at The Village. You will be ever so glad that you did!"

It is a DREAM to anyone who loves to cook. This is hands down the BEST AirbNb we have every stayed out. The host is so kind and responsive. Literally she and her gorgeous home are FIVE STARS."

It’s close enough to town for restaurants and shopping. But it’s quieter than being in town which allows for a good nights rest as well are both light sleepers.

Stayed a few nights",It felt like home! Had a mixup about the lockbox but Shane got it straighten around immediately. We had to leave a day early because of a family emergency so we really didn’t get to explore Rolla but it seems like a wonderful town! All in all it gets a 5 star from us!

The neighborhood is quiet and the house itself is in a cul-de-sac so there’s not a lot of traffic. There’s not really anything within walking distance and the surrounding roads don’t have sidewalks but Rolla is not huge so it doesn’t take long to drive anywhere you need to go. Beds and pillows were comfy! I’d definitely stay here again.

The location is phenomenal, quiet and off the beaten path, but very close to everything in Rolla you might need to get to. Had not grilled with charcoal in ages, had probably the best burger of my life, compliments of the grill on the deck!;)

The AirBnb is a spacious duplex that has a great floor plan including 2 bedrooms, 2 updated bathrooms, an updated kitchen, dining area, living area, laundry room and 1 car attached garage. It is modern, tastefully decorated, and clean.
Communication with both the AirBnb website and Shane was excellent. Checkin and checkout procedures were easy to follow. We messaged Shane twice about TV programming and heard back from him within a minute.
All of this and the price was reasonable. I would definitely recommend this AirBnb."

Stayed one night","we stayed here while visiting friends in Steelville. It was a convenient location and the drive between the two cities is lovely. we pretty much just used the beds and bathrooms but the kitchen does seem to be pretty well stocked with pans and baking trays/ dishes, coffee maker &pods with creamers, waters in fridge, and a nice selection of glasses and dishes for our use. There is also a blender a hand mixer and a toaster :-) the beds were comfortable and the house is Charming. Great water pressure in the shower! super easy to access the house with an exterior lock box and quiet Street. it does share a wall but we did not hear the neighbors. we did not use the garage but it looks like you might be able to use it if the weather was inclement. also did not use the back deck or grill but it is an awesome feature! I also really like that they provided several throw blankets for curling up and watching TV and that we had two pillows per person that is a definite put this house on my favorite list! thanks for having your house on Airbnb!"

I highly recommend this place as your Fort Leonard Wood stay instead of the well-worn hotels offered in the area. You won't be disappointed. Hosts were responsive and awesome to deal with.

TVs in every room which is great but run on WiFi and the service was not great so made it difficult to watch. WiFi for phones was spotty. Unfortunately most likely just because of location.
Overall a great place that was the perfect fit for college family weekend at Rolla where we could all hang out together!"

Upon my arrival, the farmhouse was so welcoming! First the surroundings were gorgeous and the home spectacular!! We had everything we needed and more…including a sweet welcoming package. The house was in pristine condition. Did I mention the wrap around porch with rocked and a swing my bedroom? We didn’t let the heat stop us from enjoying it. We particularly enjoyed the games downstairs. The most treasured item was a gaming system that included the original Mario….my grandson, daughter in law and husband loved it! Coco Bros were available anytime we needed them and even had a great dinner suggestion. I highly recommend this home and the Coco Bros!"

There are many notes in the guidebook and posted in the house to give clear directions on how to find, use and care for items in the house.

1. Internet is too slow. Even YouTube streaming on Tv is slow always.
2. It took me 2 hrs to figure out thermostat. So unless you are tech person it could be bit difficult.
3. Grass were taller on front yard and it is difficult to walk and enter the house. I requested host but they didn't take any action for customer satisfaction
4. Washing machine was in basement and basement is kinda dirty. Didn't feel like going down and washing clothes often.
Advantages:
House is clean and good.

Stayed a few nights","Such a nice and comforting visit in Rolla
Very clean, everything was labeled, and the guidelines were clear so there was no confusion. It was great for us to be able to unwind in a home that felt safe for us new to AirBnB.
The only thing to be slightly aware of is the internet speed, it worked reliably for my partner’s work and was certainly acceptable - it just was a little sluggish handling a few devices using the internet at once (not a reason to count the place out, that’s for sure! :) )
Safe, comfortable, and awesome! Book this place if you need a place in town."

Stayed with kids","Had a good experience here, and would stay again. The little details-- like having closet hangers and clean fans, plenty of toilet paper etc., made this a really comfortable stay.
My one concern was that the windows were not locked properly (probably due to new windows being in an older home), and I did have to figure out how to get them secured on my own. I communicated this to the host who had not been aware of this safety issue prior. Hopefully this will not be an issue for future guests now that it has been brought to their attention.
Still, it was a very cozy little home and I would recommend it."

Stayed a few nights","We stayed at The Mona Lisa House for a basic training graduation for our daughters boyfriend at Fort Leonard Wood. It was a great location just off the highway, approximately 25-30 minutes away from base but you wouldn’t know it with the beautiful scenery to take in on the drive. The home is beautifully decorated and had everything we needed to make our stay as comfortable as possible. Beds were comfortable enough that we’re now looking into purchasing a similar type. I usually have a rough time finding a good bed because of back issues that I have. Tessa is very informative and easy to communicate with. Check-in and check-out is flawless. This is our first Airbnb rental and now it won’t be our last! Thanks so much for a great first experience!!

Stayed with kids","Absolutely terrible experience at this place! The house looks super cute in photos, but it wasn’t a very clean place. There were dead bugs, TONS of cobwebs in the basement where the washer and dryer are, you walk face first into them trying to do laundry. The washer smelled of mildew and musky. My daughter was grossed out by dried food on the utensils and we had to go buy a brillo pad to scrub down a pan with burnt food on it. The house was hot, I had to turn the air way down to 66 just to cool it down so I could sleep. You’d set it and it would turn itself back up to 75. We all woke up hot and kept having to change the thermostat. This happened the entire stay. I wasn’t going to write a review at all, until I got a $500 request for damages that we didn’t create. There was a lamp in one of the bedrooms that never worked and at the end of our stay when we stripped the sheets, I bumped the lamp with my leg and the whole shade and lightbulb fell off. When I looked at it, I could see wires hanging out and could see where a gray putty had been used to repair the bulb. When I was sent photos of the lamp and lightbulb, you could see the putty so there’s my proof of it being previously damaged. I actually had to unscrew the entire lamp to get everything to go back together. I did not break the lamp, and it definitely wasn’t worth $200 that I was accused of. I was also accused of knocking a hole in the wall which did not happen, and was requested $300 to patch a tiny little hole that you could fix with some $5 spackling and a coat of paint. Absolutely ridiculous experience and I’d never return!"

We were perfectly comfortable through it all. The home is easy to find, well located close to the S & T campus, and very well appointed, cute and nicely updated.
There kitchen and living room are open, and both well set for guests. Comfortable beds and a nice bathroom with plenty of towels made for good sleep and easy preparation for the day.
We really enjoyed the stay, and would love to stay here again on a future trip to Rolla."

The yard did not match the photo, however, we visited on one of the snowiest, coldest weekends in recent history, so I’m sure that doesn’t compare to the summer when the photo was taken . Once we were inside we thought the place was very nice, clean and met our needs. I just wanted others to be aware that first impressions don’t always accurately match the final impression. Shane was very attentive to our questions. The house was quiet and very clean. Overall we were pleased with our stay."

Group trip","Went to visit my brother at school. The location was very close to the school and everything in town seemed centralized which was nice. The interior of the house was very nice with just a few blemishes to give it some character. There is only street parking and it’s close to a police station so we felt relatively safe. There’s also some yard and space between houses so fairly private. We had some issues with spotty Wi-Fi and Shane was quick to respond and offer resolutions to fix the issues. The beds are comfortable the instructions provided for check out were minimal, simple, and straightforward which is appreciated so we could quickly get back to our 8 hour drive back. Would definitely recommend and stay again!"

Group trip","Second time staying here. Love how clean & clutter free it always is, how comfortable beds are & close to everything we can walk. It's usually pretty silent back there, so we were surprised when the house next door was loudly torn down from 5-8 am on a Saturday morning. Contacted Shane who had idea that was happening, who apologized profusely and said he would find out what's going on, but don't think we heard back. Thankfully it was pretty well done after that. Only other thing to mention was I don't know what's going on with that wonderful huge bathtub, but it looks like someone tried to patch it with a moldy green towel. I mean we could shower, but I love taking a bath in that big tub and I just couldn't with that rough nasty looking thing. Hopefully they fix it better soon. Needless to say, we've booked it again for St. Pat's when we'll be back!"

Group trip","We stayed for 3 nights and the place was nice, clean, and peaceful. The beds was uncomfortable because it dips in the middle causing you to sleep close to the edge to keep from rolling, which is very uncomfortable with me having back issues. We also ran out of toilet paper, 6 women and only 2 rolls of toilet paper which cause me to leave at 9pm to go get some. I’ve never booked an Airbnb before but now I know I can ask questions before booking, like location. Overall, the experience was good. The home itself was nice."

My sister-in-laws car was vandalized while we slept which is insane because the house is right across the street from the Sheriff's Dept and a prison. Shane refused a full refund which is fine because I won't be back. Fugitive Beach was fun though.

Kitchen was gorgeous and so fun to cook in all items available and thoughtful snacks like microwave popcorn and water, perfect for a kids movie night and great streaming services for watching shows. Bathroom was spa like with tons of nice fluffy towels and the bedrooms were spacious with comfortable beds and luxurious bedding. Loved the lit battery operated candles all over such a nice touch!

Something we noticed and really appreciated was the fact that almost every steaming channel already had a login and a profile dedicated to the guests staying in the Airbnb. It was such a relief to finally get unpacked, put the baby to bed, and just sit on the couch and relax watching a movie without having to go through the trouble of logging into my personal account. It’s a small thing, but it made a difference and set Shane’s place apart from the others. If I’m ever in Rolla again, I’ll definitely be booking with Shane!"

Stayed one night","This was the first time we opted to stay Air BnB in leu of staying at a hotel. Price was comparable to one night at a decent hotel. Instructions were clear, host reached out before our stay, and the accommodations were perfect for what we were looking for. The best part, unbeknownst to us, was the use of the one car garage. There was a storm that came through overnight and my car was protected from the elements. Would definitely stay again."

Stayed a few nights","Shane was the best host I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. Timely responses, clean home, and a beautiful furnished kitchen. My husband was graduating from military police training at ft Leonard wood and I was struggling to find a nice quiet place with a kitchen that would also allow my service dog in training Shiloh since he is not yet fully certified. Shane did the most incredible thing for me by letting me have my family together for the short time that was given to us. It truly was a dream and such a gift! On top of that he went above and beyond by giving us the green light for my sister in laws dog who was supposed to join us but didn’t due to a vet reschedule. If I could give Shane all the stars in the world I would. Thank you again for the amazing experience! Should I come back I know exactly who to book from! Highly recommended!!"

Stayed with kids",As a first time Air BNB user I could not have been happier with the home. I had a ton of questions and Shane was always quick with a response. The home was very open and made relaxing easy to do without feeling cramped. There were four of us and everything we needed was in the home. The instructions and guidelines were posted and easy to follow (and fair) and the wifi worked great. After long and frenetic days with the extended family this was the perfect place to come back to. And the Misses loved to sit on the back deck and just 'breathe' in the country air; and watch lightning bugs! We will definitely use Shane for our next trip back to Missouri!

The kitchen had all of the basics needed to cook meals and there were plenty of dishes and silverware to use. We enjoyed the coffee and Keurig machine. Having laundry machines was beneficial too. Bathrooms had basic towels and washcloths- if needed guests can wash and reuse towels during their stay. We recommend pillows of your own if you enjoy firm support, the ones provided are very soft and fluffy. AC temperature was comfortable day and night. We would visit again if we return to the area! When we needed to contact Shane, he did respond fairly quickly. We felt the description and prices matched the home and its amenities perfectly."

I am finishing up my Master’s on top of working full time and one night I went outside on the deck with a glass of wine and it was lovely. Exact little break I needed. Thank you Shane!"

Stayed one night","Overall the place was good. More attention to detail would make this place great. There’s still pencil marks on the tiles in the shower so must not have ever been cleaned thoroughly. But when you find something really dirty it’s very hard to feel like everything else is clean. The rug needed vacuuming. The master bath was not cleaned. There was toothpaste splatter on the mirror and faucet/sink. There was hair in the shower. But worst of all, there was pee running down the side of the toilet that ran next to the toilet and created a pool behind it. 🤢 So gross! It was dried so had been there for a bit. I did let Shane know and he apologized and offered to have someone come the next morning to clean it which was appreciated. But we were only staying one night, leaving in the morning so that was pointless. He didn’t offer to have cleaning fee refunded, or even part of it. Might give it another chance if we are in the area."

I wanted a place close to the hospital in case my mom wasnt released quickly. Everything was so hectic and stressful so finding this place was a miracle. I requested the booking at 11pm and Janice responded within minutes. I was able to pick up my family's luggage from the hospital parking lot, get it to the house, pick up food for my brother and dad and get back to the hospital literally 30 min from requesting. I could not have gotten through that night without this propertyand without the quickness of Janice 💙"

Stayed with kids","Mossman Cottage is utterly enchanting. It sits at the end of a quiet street in the midst of a large shaded yard bordering a quiet field where does and their fawns silently meander out of the woods and bird song fills the air. Amy and Barbara have put a lot of thought into their guests’ comfort from the throws and recliners in the living room and a large closet in the main living space where one can easily store things out of sight, to plenty of linens in the large bathroom, to extra blankets and fans in the bedrooms, and plenty of dishes in the kitchen. They were prompt with replies to all of my questions and check-in was very easy. Everything felt welcoming and homey. While the step up and down between rooms and the steep stairs to the adorable second bedroom under the eaves aren’t for those with mobility challenges, it does add to the cottage’s charm, and I wholeheartedly recommend this stay to absolutely everyone else."

We were in Rolla to turkey hunt in the Mark Twain forest and what a nice place the cottage was to kick back during the timeout period that Missouri has after 1pm for turkey hunting. The cottage had an old timey feel to it and was very convenient to everything in Rolla and close to the interstate for easy travel to annd from each day. I definitely recommend a stay here for those traveling in this area.

Lots of great places to eat nearby and it’s also great for checking out some wildlife. Lots of deer sightings right out in the yard and some sweet visits from some neighborhood cats that come by for snuggles. The cabin is clean and well stocked with amenities. We will definitely be back.

Stayed a few nights","Mossman Cottage was great. The lockbox was a bit of a challenge - Amy's directions were exactly right but we needed to take a closer look at the box to find out that just the combination plate and not more of the box released
The cottage was very comfortable-- the quiet location and front porch for watching the deer were just as pictured. We also appreciated the TV and wi-fi connection option when we felt the need to reconnect for a bit. The choice for air conditiioning or open windows was perfect for the time we were there.
We did not use the 2nd floor bedroom (although I did have to at least check it out just because it was there). The single steps to access the kitchen from either the main room and bedroom were not a problem at all and added to the charm. We would definitely consider returning if we are in the area.
Thanks, Amy, for everything."

There is a nice long walking/biking trail just a block or two away that I enjoyed in the evening (despite the heat!).

Stayed about a week","We had a great 10 day stay in this quiet neighborhood cottage. When we arrived 2 deer were there to greet us near our front door and fireflies flickered in the back yard. We really liked the park and path that was very close by. Amy was attentive and we had no problems during the stay. When we are back in Rolla, we hope to be able to book again!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a perfect house for a family or group of 2-4. It is a very clean, spacious, and quiet place to stay. It has all of your common household needs and then some. It was close enough to many wonderful activities, restaurants, and grocery stores. It was also located in a great area, where you can see a lot of wildlife while also conveniently close to the city. I would recommend this place if you are looking for something that is both welcoming and well designed.
Thank you for such a great experience."

Internet was crazy fast, I took numerous video calls without issue. Lots of natural light and wildlife to help your sanity while on business calls. Very quiet and peaceful yet close enough to town for errands. I felt extremely safe, yet was still tucked into a park. There is a gorgeous running/nature trail steps away as well as a playground for your kiddos. Loved it and hope to be back."

We also used the wedding venue on the site. This is where this property really shines. Judy, the owner had so much attention to detail from the day we booked all the way up to the wedding date. We chose the mini wedding & we never once felt like we got “lesser” service because we didn’t choose a large package. On wedding day, Judy was easily accessible. She anticipated our needs and seemed to show up wherever we needed her. Everything was perfect from the airb&bs to the wedding venue. I would recommend The Village to anyone!! Love love loved it!!"

This was a wonderful, peaceful place to stay and the house was so well appointed! Everything you can imagine you might need is already there waiting and the decor is fabulous and comfortable. The beds were comfortable and linens are excellent and high end - so comfortable! This is such a unique and quaint “village”and atmosphere! Made the stay so much fun. We had a great time walking and exploring and enjoying nature and the beautiful surroundings. I even messed up on my reservation dates and Judy was SO accommodating.

While it sleeps 6, the kitchen and living area are small but the only place to be together and it’s tiny. The kitchen was well stocked with dishes and supplies as were the bathrooms. The ice maker in the fridge malfunctioned and dumped ice all over the floor the first day, not sure if the fridge is tricky or what. The newer throw blankets were a nice touch."

Stayed a few nights","GLITZ AND GLAM!!!!!! The Blacksmith Bungalow is a whole lot of Beverly and a touch of Hillbilly. Inside, it's very spacious, super-duper modern, gorgeous, and extremely fancy. It's chock-full of cool games and the Roku TV has tons of entertainment options, plus the internet is exceptionally fast... For the most part, it makes up for the near-total lack of cell service. It was beyond clean and the bedding was possibly the most comfortable I've ever experienced *anywhere*, no joke! The Village is a very peaceful, secluded location and shockingly close to the billion or so amenities available in lovely Rolla. The gravel roads are a bit rough but a standard car can handle it if you drive with care. PLEASE do know that it is NOT lit at night and VERY hard to navigate in the dark; in daylight, the signs are handy. I forgot my fishing pole, but the pond would've been an awesome place to fish if I had brought it. Would recommend for a quiet, beautiful stay!"

The reviews I read made it seem like it had a fenced yard so I was a little disappointed that it didn’t. (I think maybe the reviews for all the rentals are collected in one place on the airbnb site and I didn’t realize that). Even so it was a great experience and we’d love to stay again soon.

Stayed with a pet","This is truly a hidden gem. We've experienced many airbnb's in Rolla while visiting our daughter, but this one is a cut above the norm. It's in an incredibly beautiful, quiet, and serene setting. There is nothing to compare with sitting on the porch swing, watching the sunset while the windmill lazily twirls around. The Blacksmith cottage is 100% up to date with sparkly clean appliances, a well-equipped kitchen, comfortable furniture and beds. and little touches - hot cocoa mix, biscotti, and popcorn provided for guests. It has everything you expect in 2023 with the rustic look of the 1800's. Judy was an absolutely fantastic host and was extremely communicative. We absolutely loved our stay, and hope that it will be available for future visits."

The place was impeccably clean and decorated beautifully. We felt right at home with all of the amenities offered. We especially enjoyed the beds - they were SO comfortable. The front porch swing was the perfect way for us to relax and enjoy the evenings after our kids went to bed. The ONLY thing I would recommend is that a new kitchen sponge be provided. There was a sponge that had previously been used left for us. It was not the end of the world, but it wasn’t my ideal scenario. Other than that, it was perfect."

Judy and Jim have a gem of a property and they have worked hard to create a top notch location with 4 homes of various sizes to rent. Each home is spotless and stunningly decorated with every amenity you would need. The homes are spread apart and surrounded by woods so each home is very private. A perfect location to get away from it all with family and extended family. An easy drive to MS&T. They even host weddings and special events.

It was a wonderful escape from base for our Marine, plenty of space to relax, play board games, throw the football outside, go for long walks with our 4month old puppy and even had a fire in the fire pit one evening with wood provided! The kitchen is fully stocked and even included complimentary breakfast items, coffee and hot cocoa, even popcorn! The washer/dryer are incredibly high tech and require NO detergent or dryer sheets! And your clothes come out clean and smelling fresh! Judy was very quick to return my enquires. She went above and beyond letting us check in early and check out late due to my son’s graduation schedule. She even set me up with a dog walker from her staff while we were out for Family Day. I can’t rave enough about this place and Judy. It truly allowed our family of 4 to have a long over due wonderful mini vaca."

She even was thoughtful enough to include a first aid kit, emergency candles, everything I could possibly think of even seasonings for food and supplied coffee, Cream and sugar. Which I could not have been more thankful for. The home was amazing but the surroundings was excellent as well. I walked around for a long time just taking beautiful pictures. Her communication was excellent we had many changes and she was gracious enough to accommodate all of them. Truly worth every penny. The beds are comfortable everything is so clean. I don’t have enough good things to say to express the wonderful experience we had. I truly recommend this place. My daughter and I would love to come back to this place again. Oh The front porch swing was wonderful. It was so quiet and tranquil there. Definitely must experience this. We highly recommend it."

Stayed a few nights","Pictures do not do this rental or property justice!! The location is about 5/10 minutes from downtown Rolla - Judy provides detailed instructions on driving into the location, as it is a sharp right at the bottom of a hill. Be careful - there are a couple HUGE potholes as you turn in. You will drive through the entire property to get to the rental - it is so cute, a wedding would be beautiful here. Make sure you take some time to walk around and check things out. There is ample parking and even doggie doo bags on the shed next door! Cute porch. Inside, everything was SO clean. Cute living area with fireplace, very well stocked kitchen, even Disney+ for the TV! Very nice laundry area, well-appointed bathrooms and bedrooms. Comfy beds with lots of bedding/comforters/blankets - everything you could want if you are someone that is cold all the time like me :) I wish we were staying a whole week, not just a quick weekend. The only negative at all is that the 'master' bathroom shower - the way the door opens, you have to get a little wet to turn the shower on. And the showerhead is nice, but lacking pressure, so ladies with long hair, it will take you a while. If those are the worst parts about this place though, you know you found a good one! There was even Kleenex, which has been unheard of in Airbnbs I've stayed in (it's the little things, I tell ya). Can't wait to come back for a slightly longer stay next year!!"

The bed was so comfortable that I am going to buy one for my own home. Also, it was great that there was a nice portable crib bc we had an 8 month old with our group.

We were in town to celebrate my father's 90th birthday with family from all over the country, and when we showed them pictures of where we were staying, they were jealous. Next time, one of them is going to snap it up before we get a chance to book. Don't miss your chance.

The washer & dryer are new and modern. The refrigerator is roomy. Hard floors throughout. The beds and couch were comfortable. Kitchen table seats 8. Simple instructions make your stay easy. It is tucked away off a winding road with the town of Rolla accessible in about 15 minutes. Wish we had had more downtime to simply be in the house! A+ accommodations and host!"

Rolla was the best place for us to stop on a long roadtrip after a 12-hour day of driving, and we could not have been happier with our decision to stay here! The directions were clear so we had no problem finding it, and we were in for a treat! The old Western Town vibe was amazing, and the Blacksmith was beyond our expectations. Sparkling clean - seriously, I can't even describe how clean the place was - and so beautifully decorated. Our pup loved the concrete floors - he ran laps down the hallway and around the kitchen table (gleeful to not be in the car anymore!) - and we humans loved the comfortable couch, fireplace and omg the amenities! Shower...excellent. Washer/Dryer...so convenient. Beds? Dreamland.

Stayed one night","Loved our stay at the Bungalow, it was very peaceful and unique. Driveway could be rough on some vehicles depending on the time of year, communication was very timely, AND they were pet friendly! Would recommend for someone passing through the area."

Stayed with kids","My family and I came down to explore the area and meet up with my sister, who lives in Springfield, MO. We chose this place because of its themed charm and wooded location. The property is absolutely gorgeous. The little village scene is picturesque and gave my three kids plenty of ideas for their imaginations to play with. The house was beautiful, exactly how I would want my dream home to look. We had plenty of room for 6 people and had every ""home away from home"" amenity that we would ever need. The house was clean and well-cared for. We could have stayed there forever if could! Thank you Judy and Jim for being so hospitable and kind to my family. We felt right at home. We are already planning another trip down and will be staying at the Blacksmith's Shop."

Stayed with kids","This space is so unique and beautiful! The fireplace kept us toasty during the below zero temps of our trip and our young daughters were excited to bundle up and go explore during the sunshine hours of the day! Judy was extremely helpful with local tips and thoughtful of party as our trip proceeded! If you're looking for a unique and relaxed stay, this is the place!"

Stayed with kids","Great location!!
Modern amenities!
Secluded yet safe (located on 53+ acres).
Super comfy beds!
We will definitely be back...
Great for parents of MS&T students or anyone passing through the famous Route 66.
Beautiful woods on every side and honestly feels like you’re staying in an old western town with modern amenities."

Stayed with kids","This enchanting space is a traveler's or vacationer's dream! Clean and tidy, well stocked and comfortable, it offered every thing we could possibly need on our trip through Missouri. Our family enjoyed several walks around the beautiful grounds and slept soundly in the comfortable beds. We give this place five stars and a standing ovation!"
