Stayed with a pet","Booked this home for a family trip from Florida to experience the total eclipse. This home was great & the interior was beautiful! Looks just like the photos. Was the perfect size & just what we needed. Close to the interstate- approx 37 mins from Little Rock & 1.5 hr from Petit Jean State Park (a MUST see- definitely worth the drive).
Close to a Walmart, bowling and other attractions."

He understands luxurious, clean, spacious, safe accomodating and comfortable homes away from home. He is hands down 200% customer focused and extremely quick on response time. I am so glad to stay in his homes! You will not go wrong with anything having his name on it!! Believe me when I say you are missing out if you are not staying in one of his homes!"

The house was very clean, and the surprise was a furnished outdoor area in the back to enjoy the warm afternoons in between activities. Check in was easy, communication was quick, and it's obvious that the host was thoughtful about the decor around the home. We would absolutely stay again and spread the word with people we encountered in town. Many didn't know an AirBnb existed in their small town!"

The large size of the home allows everyone some good space after a long day in the car. The furniture and beds are comfortable. The kitchen could use a few more items but it was functional enough. The owner responded very quickly when I could not get on the internet. This was our second stay at this property and we would gladly stay again.

I have three small children and this place was perfect for us with ample amount of space for the littles to roam. There is an alarm system that made us feel even more at ease. The decor was absolutely beautiful and the house was so spacious and well laid out. The host was very responsive and friendly. They even left out snacks for us, which my kids loved! The only thing that was a little hard on us was the checkout time at 9 AM. However, they did offer an early check in the day of arrival, but we were not coming in until late. They had everything you needed for a comfortable stay and good coffee! I would stay here again!"

Tonya was amazing! There were storms going through the area and she took the time to keep us updated and checked on our progress. She was so warm and friendly that I was looking forward to our stay before we even got there.
The home itself was very clean and comfortable. And one of the most efficiently well stocked stays we’ve encountered. After a long day driving with the grandkids, I was very thankful to find everything we would need was provided. So a late night trip to the store wasn’t necessary.
And…there were snacks! Which the kids loved. Definitely a win!!👍🏻
If we’re ever going through the area and in need of a place to stay, this will be our first choice."

Small complaint has been made by others-the chore list combined with such an early checkout left my family feeling rushed to get out. Just be sure to check this list the night before. I was not clear there was so much to do until I got an email when we were leisurely enjoying our morning coffee. Had to hustle to get out in time-25 dollars is charged if you’re there after 9:00.

check in was a little late (3pm) and check out was very early (9am). I didn't particularly like the list of chores that needed to be done by guests before leaving, although I understand the reasoning.
reasonable pricing for the amount of space available.
JDT3 was very polite, respectful, and accommodating. I look forward to using one of their properties again."

Stayed over a week","We really enjoyed our stay in Pine Bluff during our work trip. The home is well-decorated, clean, and comfortable. We enjoyed having the extra amenities you don’t find in most hotels. After a long day at work, it was so nice to come back and be able to cook a nice meal in one of the two kitchens. The hosts are kind and very quick to respond. We did have a minor issue with the water being turned off when we returned one afternoon. After messaging the host, they had a maintenance man on the property and the water fixed in under half an hour. We will definitely be booking this home again, should we ever find ourselves back in Pine Bluff."

I reached out to Frederick and although I've used AirBnb before, his instructions were listed...I missed something and asked questions. His response was more like...""Read instructions "". then he answered. it was the way he worded it... it could've taken wrong. So I didn't ask anything else. House was wonderful experience though!!"

During each visit I have received the same level of cleanliness and thoughtful touches through the property. He and his team remain responsive and eager to handle anything that occurs during the stay.
Value is the second word I’d like to describe. I truly feel that the value is superb. I’m sure you will see my name on multiple reviews so that should speak for itself.
I travel often and I feel Frederick’s place is at the very top of my list for value, comfort, decor, and amenities."

Stayed a few nights","Unfortunately, the property didn't live up to the nice pictures that were posted. Everything felt very cheap and all of the upgrades that were done seemed to be done by a nonprofessional. The flooring was uneven and all of the furniture was old and worn out. I had to thoroughly clean the hall bathroom before I could use it.
Andrew made a comment about my having an additional guest the first night which made me feel as if I was being spied on. There were bugs (dead and alive) that made me feel uneasy so I had a friend stay with me the first night. I had hoped for a better experience and to find a property to return to when I need to stay in Pine Bluff for an extended period but unfortunately, I did not find it here. A lot needs to be done to make this property more comfortable."

Stayed with a pet","The place was perfect for what we needed. The ""house rules"", although fully clear and upfront, seem a bit strict. This is the only AirBNB where I felt I needed to mop and run a lint roller over the furniture prior to departing in order to not get charged an additional $100 fee for something. And the cleaning team was waiting at the street corner for us to depart. The area was very quiet, just as described, and seemed safe. It stormed all night the night before we left and we woke to a lake in the backyard, what a surprise. That obviously couldn't be helped but might be good to know if you are coming to stay during the stormy season. The follow-up message that came the day after check-in is definitely a nice touch and shows Frederick's team is attentive. Frederick was VERY responsive and quickly rectified the one issue we discovered! It is ALWAYS nice to have a washer/dryer in a place so you can go home with clean clothes."

He called us to make sure we had gotten in OK, and once more to tell us his maintenance person was coming by to get something out of the garage. The garage is inaccessible to guests, as it is used for storage for management of his properties, which is a very smart business decision on his part as property manager. We very much enjoyed our stay and will look for this property again on our next visit to the area! Fredrick was a gracious, welcoming host, which is important to your stay. Highly recommended!"

Stayed about a week","Our family of 4 stayed here for a week. The house was amazing- well decorated, clean, and comfortable. The beds were very nice and the kitchen had everything we needed to prepare meals. The neighborhood was quiet and felt really safe. Fredrick communicated well throughout our stay and check-in was a breeze. The only weird thing was someone came to the door one day asking if we would help him by giving him money. My fault for opening the door for a stranger. Overall a great experience. We will definitely stay here next time we are in pine bluff!"

Well worth the price. I would rent again and again. Other thing if you have a dog or dogs the back yard is great with 6' privacy fence as well. Do not pass up this rental. Well worth every penny. Withe cost of hotels currently this is so much better. Can not wait for my next trip to Arkansas.

Stayed a few nights","I recently stayed at the 81 cozy Airbnb. To say It was a great place would be an understatement. This is because I've stated many great places. But many things about this location in particular set it a cut above the rest. First, let me say Mr. Jackson is hands on and was a great help. I started off having problems accessing my Airbnb account once I made it to Pine Bluff. This was my fault for not getting my information before I left California, so I was in a jam. After figuring out how to contact the host I was provided all the information that I needed for my stay. Mr. Jackson was very accommodating and fast to respond. Next, I went to the home. When I walked through the door, I was greeted with the pleasant, fresh smell of clean. The home was well lit and wonderfully decorated. It is so much better in person than the pictures. The space is appointed with every luxury that you would hope to have in your place of stay. To me, it was like a Las Vegas suite at one of the top hotels. But this is Pine bluff, Arkansas. How is this possible… Mr. Jackson is how! It met my satisfaction, and I was stunned by the amount of detail that went into setting up the house. I felt at home and at peace. I will be returning."

The beds were VERY comfortable, both my co-worker and I commented on the beds that it was the best sleep in an AirBNB having been in 4 different places in the past month.
Frederick was always quick to respond and willing to help with anything. Internet speeds were great also!
Would recommend to anyone sand will be looking to stay again next time I’m in the area."

Stayed a few nights","This Airbnb was Everything for Us! We are originally from the area, but we moved to the city 17 years ago, so for us to be able to come in town and experienced peace & tranquility means alot. The host was amazing, very responsive & clear on instructions. The house had everything we needed; it was very spacious & clean. We were able to host Christmas Dinner without clutter. I also loved how the home is modernized, but I would like to recommend that since people do rent this Airbnb during the winter season that you put a fire pit outside on the patio. We enjoyed the sitting arrangement on the patio, but we couldn't sit out very long because of cold weather. The fire pit will be a great amenity. We also had problems with the water temperature going in & out when we showered, but I feel this was uncontrollable due to the extreme cold weather. I will rent this Airbnb over & over versus going to a Hotel!"

I have high sensitivity to allergens and this home was pristine. The home reflects a very thoughtful designer-inspired curation of comforts and lovely visually appealing touches. Very comfortable, very clean. We only used the master bedroom, but all rooms were well done. Linens super soft and everything looked new. It’s so rare to find such a beautiful home with high quality furnishings that are pet-friendly, and that’s exactly what we needed on this long road trip. Perfect. Book it.

Stayed a few nights",I had a great time staying at this property. I am from Pine Bluff and know how rough some of the areas look. This Airbnb eased that anxiety as it’s in a good area. Walmart along with fast food/restaurants are not far which makes this an awesome spot. The house was very clean upon arrival and had very easy instructions on how to enter. The property owner was very responsive to our needs. This airbnb has a lot of space and was able to accommodate our family as we celebrated my little sister’s graduation. Only things I had concerns about were the code for downloading apps on the tv and the dog next door. Certain apps should already be on the tv so there is no need to request a code. Someone needing to come to the airbnb just for that made me a little uncomfortable. Aside from that the dog next door made it hard to step outside at night as he would not stop barking. Overall the stay was very good and I would definitely stay again.

Stayed with kids","Our main reason for the poor review is that the only shower in the house was not working and leaked through the wall and all over the bathroom floor. We arrived late as this was just an overnight stop on our road trip to New Orleans. When we realized the issue and contacted the host, they were immediately responsive. I also understand that it was too late to deal with, plus we were tired. Although after i explained that we really just rented the home to shower and sleep for the night, and were unable shower . I requested a that we might receive a partial refund, and the host never responded. The home was as pictured. Nice decorations, updated and fairly clean. The night stand had a sticky ring obviously from a glass of something that been sitting there. The master bed was pretty stiff also."

Stayed with kids",We enjoyed our stay while we were in Pine Bluff for a wedding. We had plenty of room and the host left snacks and water which was a nice touch. Entering the neighborhood some of the houses were a little run down but the house we were in was updated and even festive (Easter decor). Our street was very quiet and the neighbors were sweet and friendly. This is our first time staying in a house in a neighborhood.

Stayed with kids","I really can’t say enough about our stay. For starters, the house is absolutely beautifully furnished. From the outside, it looks like a simple older brick home, but the inside has a designer’s touch! Beautiful and clean furnishings, artwork, etc. The home felt clean and cozy. My kids loved the TVs in the bedrooms. It is a gem! The owner is incredibly kind, accommodating and responsive. We left something very important at the house, and she handled getting it to us quickly and communicated thoroughly. This will be our go-to stay when visiting family in Pine Bluff!!"

It was very clean and comfortable and close to everywhere we had to go! I absolutely loved all of the appliances and the best part was the sympathy card the host left for us! That was so kind and considerate and very much appreciated! I would definitely recommend this place if you're traveling to Pine Bluff and will most definitely stay again if we return!

Stayed with a pet","We have been traveling to family in West Virginia and this was a one night stay for us. It is hard not to compare the different hosts for each home. To date we really enjoyed our stay the first night on the road in Pine Bluff. The home was clean, fairly well stocked and very easy to find. I recommend their properties if you happen to be passing through an area they manage. PS ...We are sorry ... we literally just realize that neither of us took out the trash! Of the 6 we have stayed out thus far on this trip your instructions and information book were by far the best. I apologize that we just didn't do very well following that last step. Thank you."
