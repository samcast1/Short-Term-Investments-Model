Stayed over a week","The place looks like in the pictures and it’s very spacious. I stayed here with a roommate (friend from university) and it went well, I slept in the bedroom and she slept in the livingroom’s bed/couch. The kitchen is well equipped and the furnitures throughout the house are in good shape. However the house is quite old which can be noticed sometimes. But overall the place is really nice and we had great time in our long visit here. And Matt and Rachel were very friendly, thoughtful and helpful."

Stayed a few nights",My daughter and I stayed here for four nights while we were visiting the area on college tours. It was perfect for us. The house is in a sweet neighborhood on a quiet street and looks exactly like the photos. I thought the bed was heaven and I slept so well! The weather was a little chilly while we were there and we loved all the soft snuggly blankets to curl up under while we watched Netflix together in the couch. Being able to do laundry was a major plus! If my daughter lands at OSU I will definitely want to stay here again. Loved Matt and Rachel’s place!!!

Stayed a few nights","Very comfortable and cozy stay during a wintery weekend in Corvallis. Hosts let us know when the cleaners left so we could check in early, which was wonderful since we arrived in town earlier than expected and it was very cold and wet (snowed both nights we were there!!). We easily settled in because the property is spacious and has everything you need. I would absolutely stay here again."

It’s very comfortable, has all you need, and has a great vibe.
And, it’s fantastic having a front yard that’s a well manicured garden and you did no work whatsoever!
I also like the convenience of this location, with many grocery stores nearby, as well as plenty of other businesses. And the Corvallis Planet Fitness, also nearby, is one of my favorites.
Def recommend."

The apartment is located in a central neighborhood close to all conveniences and the downtown area offering a park and local shopping. The Farmers Market occurs on Saturdays. They also have a charming and fruitful garden in the front yard with squash, zucchini and berries among other items.
The location regarding the surrounding sites is also very good. We were about 1-1.5 hours from the ocean and there is tons of hiking options in the area.
We would definitely stay with Matt and Rachel again and recommend this Airbnb to anyone who asks."

The location was very convenient, and the home was very clean. The kitchen was well stocked, and I found everything I needed to cook a meal. The bed in the bedroom was very comfortable and there is a daybed and sofa sleeper to accommodate a family with kids or friends traveling together. I absolutely loved that Matt and Rachel provided Netflix, Hulu and other streaming services. Communication with Matt and Rachels was great and prompt and when I had a question, they answered me right away. The photos of this home on the website are accurate, and this is a great value for your money. I feel great recommending this place and will look to book in the future when I return to Corvallis."

We almost always cook every meal and Barbara's kitchen was stocked with just about everything you could need, much better than most Air BnB's! This was a huge help! Lots of towels in the bathroom, soap bars, cleaning supplies, freebees in the kitchen... you can easily feel that Barbara wants her home to be your home and does all the small things very thoughtfully! The home is just adorable and I will look here first for all my future trips to Corvallis. Thank you Barbara!"

Barbara was a great host - we had sent a message when we made our reservation to ask if there was a cancellation for an extra night that we would like to stay, and she responded quickly that she would let us know if that happened. A few days before our stay she sent us another message to let us know the next guest was definitely coming, but that the place was ready and we could check in early. We were surprised to find SO many amenities and little things that she thought about that weren't even listed. This was the best stay we had on our trip, and our next stay in the area we will plan around the availability of this hidden gem!"

The host was very responsive, and on my first day reached out to me to make sure I had everything I needed. The place was spotless and was very thoughtfully furnished with everything you will need. The bed is incredibly comfortable!
I would have given a 5 star rating but for two things, and please consider these more as suggestions than complaints, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay.
1. I could not get the TV channels to work, it looked like there was no subscription and there were no instructions.
2. No AC. This was stated in the profile so I can't fault for that, however it was quite hot while I was in Corvallis. The only way to get good air circulation to cool the place off in the evening was to open the front door and the back sliding door in the bedroom. I would suggest putting a screen door on the front door to keep the bugs out."

Lots of options to keep the place cool or warm depending on the season. The bed was very comfortable. The workspace was very helpful and I appreciated that some of the outlets had USB plugs too.
Beautiful and very walkable neighborhood and just a few minute walk away from multiple grocery stores, including natural ones. The back patio is adorable and we spent a lot of time out there. It's very private and quiet. Driveway is a bit small and hard to see so we missed it the first couple times.

Very clean, great location and layout was great.
Hostess thought through so many details, and had thoughtful sweet touches throughout to make sure you had all your needs met. Even brought over a heating pad for my son when she found out he hurt his elbow at a tournament we were attending. Loved this place, would stay here again and would recommend. Also, hostess was super responsive"

The bedroom faces East and the house has excellent light with well placed windows facing all directions plus window coverings to control the brightness when needed.
The kitchen is top notch - best stocked kitchen I've ever encountered as a guest - with both coffee maker and hot pot, plus everything equipment and utensil-wise that I needed to prepare and enjoy my meals. Barbara is an excellent host and provided fresh flowers, washed plums, food offerings, and organic coffee.
Highly recommended location close to everything in Corvallis. Trader Joe's and an organic market are a short walk away. At the end of my work week, I also enjoyed some delicious food and a beverage at The Biere Library downtown by the river and had a lovely walk back to the airbnb - about 20- 25 mins. I would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","As promised, I felt like I was in a private forest glen. So quiet and looking out the window and into the trees when I woke up was just lovely. The apartment is simple but solid - not fancy, just plain good. The linens are good quality, the furniture comfortable and functional, good storage in the bedroom and kitchen. There was great attention to detail - little things like spare bathroom toiletries in case you forgot some, a nice selection of coffees for the Nespresso maker, extra towels and linens easily available. I met Sarah briefly when checking in as she finished up last touches on cleaning (which was very well done) but other than that was left to myself.
As described in the listing, cell reception was poor, BUT the wifi was very good and I had no trouble doing web-enabled calling."

Adequate kitchen for you to make home cooked meals and a great washer and dryer for those longer stays. One thing to be aware of, there is no cell service on the side of the hill where the home resides. The only way you can reach anyone is by text with an Apple iPhone with use of WiFi. No green texts can be sent out and no calls can be made until you travel down the hill - just a FYI.
Sarah, the host, is great. Very kind, helpful and accommodating. Would definitely recommend staying here! 5 Stars."

Lastly, Sarah’s instructions were clear and thorough, from check-in to check-out. And we very much appreciated that coffee and tea were provided!"

Sarah and her family were extremely accommodating of our needs and she was very attentive and responsive without being intrusive.
The indoor space is very clean and tastefully appointed and more spacious than the pictures implied. We loved doing coffee, wine or dinner on the patio or deck and spent many quiet evenings simply “considering the forest”. I loved watching the fawns walk up the trail while I studied for a big exam in the loft. Great sunsets from the road and lots of nice birdsong in the morning. Also enjoyed exploring the trails on Sarah’s property but recommend long pants and boots due to the poison oak. Great mountain bike and running trails at nearby Bald Hill and an easy, pretty drive to town and campus."

We didn't use the loft, a little scary to climb the ladder up and down for older folks, but wasn't an issue. Be careful on days that temp drops below freezing, the rain turns to slick ice on the paved pathway. Wasn't an issue either, we just walk on the grass instead. And not specific to this place either, there was ice everywhere in the area for a couple of days."

Sarah's guest house is very cute and she puts in all sorts of little touches that help you to settle in. Very cute and friendly cat. Beautiful forest location, not far from town. Foam pillows were a bit uncomfortable. Other than that, a terrific stay. Would stay in the future."

We had all the amenities we needed for a long stay, and also excellent laundry facilities, which really helps during a longer stay. This was such a relaxing place, nicely secluded among the oaks and pines with a front porch area and deck to enjoy the nature. Very quiet, exactly what we needed. The airbnb is located within in 5 minutes of Bald Hill - which has beautiful walking and hiking trails. We also enjoyed our visits from Chile, the resident cat, very friendly! We highly recommend this airbnb! We hope to stay there again when visiting family."

Stayed a few nights","This little guest house in the hills is the perfect home base for a trip to Corvallis. The studio is very well-equipped with all the essentials you need to cook at home or bring in take-out. The bed is very comfortable, tucked into a little nook off of the living room separated by a curtain. There's plenty space of with a cute loft and a separate sitting area for lounging. The forest deck makes it feel like you are miles away from everyone else. However, the location is perfect because you're just 10-15 minutes from downtown and even closer to the OSU campus. It's the perfect place for quiet, peaceful privacy. Best of all, the hosts are very kind and communicative. Sarah went above and beyond to make sure that the guest house was suitable and comfortable given that one of us has a disability. This is a perfect place to stay!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a great find! Sarah is an incredible host and very accommodating. We had trouble finding the house on the night of arrival, but we called Sarah and she came out with a headlamp to lead us in. Later in the stay, she responded to messages right away and was flexible in helping us make changes to our dates.
For the arrival, GoogleMaps brought us to a location far from the house. If this happens to you just keeping going up the hill and you'll see a post with the address. There are no lights in this neighborhood at night so try arriving before dark.
The house itself is tucked within a wooded area with lots of privacy and tranquility from the wildlife around it. We felt at home inside the house, the perfect comfort when traveling. The kitchen is well stocked for cooking, pots and pans, tea kettle, cutting boards, etc... One thing that stood out was that the soaps were earth-friendly! There is an intentional use of low-impact products at this place. Highly recommend!"

Stayed over a week","Sarah's place is in quiet, wooded area. We were frequently visited by deer and the occasional squirrel (as well Sarah's cat which is quite nice). There are lots of trails nearby for hiking and cycling. It is located a short distance from Oregon State University and the rest of Corvallis and surrounding area. Regarding the cottage itself, the loft is nice retreat from the studio-like design of the ground floor, the bathroom is large, and there is a large ""mud room"" for storing gear and luggage, which is also where the washer & dryer are located. The outdoor deck in the woods down the hill from the cottage is tranquil.
This is a good place for a short term stay. My wife and I stayed here for three months to immerse ourselves in the community as a possible place to retire. The amenities are not sufficient for a fully comfortable long stay, though. The rustic interior has a certain charm but the finish work is poor. The kitchen is very small and dated and does not have a garbage disposal or dish washer, so the preparation and clean up of meals was always a chore. The furniture is not of the highest quality (the side table and the desk and shelving in the loft are rickety, and the couch is well worn). While the bathroom is large the shower is tiny. And there are intermittent disruptions with WiFi and TV streaming.
But if you want to get away from it all for a few days or maybe even a week, this is a good place to stay."

My sister-in-law is a germophobe and didn't want me to stay with them (understandably!) after getting off a plane during a pandemic so I needed a place close by to help my brother deal with our dad's estate. I didn't have any time to appreciate the proximity to the woods and all that nature has to offer in the area, but I highly recommend it to anyone who loves to hike and spend time outdoors. It's far enough away from town to provide a peaceful and quiet place to rest, yet close enough that making a run into town for supplies is quick and easy. The place was super clean and well stocked with towels, staples, and she even provided a few essentials in case you forgot your own (which, of course, I did!). I would definitely book here again the next time I am in need of a place in Corvallis and can't stay with family!"

Stayed a few nights","Sarah was a great host responding to my e-mails and calls in a timely manner. She called me the first day checking that everything was okay.
Everyone was right in the previous reviews, this was a drop dead gorgeous setting. Woods came up to about 20 feet from the house at the entry door. 
It was so quiet  that when a car did come down the Dead End Road it was such a dichotomy between quiet and a little bit of noise.
I feel the ad should have explicitly stated there was no cell phone service other than Wi-Fi calling. Which I don't have from my service provider. I was advised by e-mail after I rented it that..."" there was very spotty cell phone service""..., and later by phone ....""there was possible  Wi-Fi calling""... Ordinarily it wouldn't have mattered but this particular weekend I came down to help my son buy a car and we needed to make multiple calls to car sellers. We wanted to hang out there and make phone calls and  cook meals. So this didn't work out for mè. I would have given 5 stars here if I'd known about the phone situation prior to renting it."

Sarah was very attentive but gave us plenty of privacy as well. Comfortable bed and couch, plenty of towels and linens and the washer and dryer were a bonus if you are staying more than a few days.

Stayed over a week","If this space is still available and you are looking for a spot in Corvallis; Stop and book it now! This is a wonderful space for a short weekend or for an extended stay. My wife, 3 month old son, and I stayed for a month and we couldn’t have been more comfortable. Sarah made sure the space for exceptionally clean and well equipped when we arrived. She had all the basic kitchen supplies (with extras like olive oil, salt, pepper, dish soap, etc.), a fully stocked bathroom with soaps, dental supplies, and other essentials. The space itself was large for 3 people with a loft, bedroom, and large living space. We were very comfortable the entire time, and Sarah was a great host always asking if we needed anything.
Beyond the space itself, the location of the Airbnb is really what makes this space special. Only 5 minutes from Corvallis, but surrounded by a wooded area we felt like we were hours from the nearest town. Easily accessible to trails and hiking, but close to everything downtown Corvallis offers, you couldn’t find a better spot! Thank you Sarah for making this such a special place!"

Stayed a few nights","This was close to being a perfect place to stay, in my opinion. It's in the foothills near town, but its still just a minute to the road and maybe 3 miles to town. There's a well equipped kitchen, a loft area with a desk, living room, tv, kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom. The air conditioning and wireless work well, although it was just one bar on my cell phone carrier (google Fi), and I couldnt use it very well. So make sure if you rent here, you record the door entry code in advance. If you forget its just maybe a 2 minute drive to the main road to get usable signal. The cottage is not connected to the main house. The host lives in an adjacent lot down a path, out of view through the trees. Theres a nice deck over a forested gorge to sit and read on, and a patio. There's a laundry room adjoining the cottage that the host said I could use if I wanted., which would be handy for a long stay. The place is utterly quiet. Theres no hum of electricity, or any hint of road noise or ""civilization"", beyond a fridge which kicks in very occasionally. At first I thought the quiet might take some getting used to, but it didn't-- I found it to be extremely restful and peaceful. Everything is spotless, and the furniture, linens, knives, etc all seemed to be a step up from what you'd usually find in a rental. The bed is comfortable.
Everything inside the cottage is custom constructed-- the beams, ladders, panels, kitchen. All of it carefully hand cut and joined, it appeared. I'd guess this space was someones hobby to create, for probably a long time.
The host was very prompt in communicating There were some welcome treats and coffee there too, which was very nice. At the end I felt a little guilty because I felt the place and Sarah's hosting were worth a lot more to me than she charged, but I guess the local market is competitive for lodgings. I'd very happily stay here again anytime, it was a great experience, and easily the best airbnb I have ever found. Thank you very much Sarah!"

Stayed a few nights","Sarah's guest house was extremely special in the sense that you get the feeling it's beyond amazing the moment your car enters her property. SPOTLESS is an understatement, as well as every single amenity that you will need is right at your fingertips in a convenient spot so you don't have to hunt around for an item you're looking for. The bed was beyond comfortable, the couch sucks you right in and everything else such as the hot water/shower were just perfect. The grounds were manicured beautifully as well as how serene and SILENT the property was, which led to the deepest sleeps that I have experienced in a long time. The WiFi was also over 100 mbps which is unheard of in many places! Also, if you have a question for Sarah, her communication is quick and immediate.
Sarah is also the most respectful of your privacy and shows the highest level of respect towards her guests. This property will be completely booked up going forward as I honestly think this was one of the greatest Airbnb's that I have ever stayed in, so act quick!
This is seriously a slice of heaven and I would highly recommend Sarah's guest home if you want that high quality hospitality, gorgeous property to stay in and everything right at your fingertips without to having to stress. Thank you, Sarah!"

One couldn’t ask for a better hostess than Sarah. Upon arriving , I found the quarters exceptionally clean, neat, and inviting. The kitchen is well equipped (even a great espresso machine), and the bed extremely comfortable. The setting is quiet , with no traffic noise, yet only a 10 to 15 minute drive to town. I hope the next time I stay in Corvallis, it will be here with my wife.

Stayed about a week","I came from California to visit Corvallis, where I grew up, to investigate whether it would be a place I’d like to move back to.
Lauren and Bob’s place was a great central location from which to explore, which I did by foot, bike and car.
I was arriving in inclement weather and Lauren checked on me before and after arrival to make sure I’d be safe in my travels and had everything I needed.
The house was immaculately furnished, decorated and cleaned. Bob is a contractor, and it shows in the exquisite woodwork and functionality of the place.
The house guidebook instructions were perfectly concise and informative.
Three days into my trip there was an ice storm, and most of the town shut down. Luckily the First Alternative Co-op was open a block away, and the kitchen at the bungalow had absolutely everything I needed to prepare meals.
The beautiful gas fireplace made being housebound a cozy, relaxing and aesthetically pleasurable experience.
Five out of five stars, no question."

Stayed a few nights","Although this place is small - perfect for one or two - it is a beautifully restored older space with a lot of details that make you feel right at home. Very relaxing and comfortable, and the kitchen it fully stocked with amenities. We didn’t cook while we were there, but we certainly could have and would have had everything we needed. The location is in a residential neighborhood at the intersection of a few roads, but felt very private with the landscaping around it. Maybe not a vacation destination in itself, but perfect for my wife and I visiting our daughter at OSU. We both had to spend some time working while we were there, and between the dining room table and the desk - not to mention good Wi-Fi - we were all set. And just two blocks from the natural foods co-op, and walking distance from from campus. Highly recommend, and hope to get back to the next time we visit."

Stayed a few nights","OUTSTANDING is the best word that comes to mind to describe our 3 night stay at the Coolidge Bungalow. EVERYTHING about Lauren and Bob's place was like a little piece of heaven. Very welcoming, peaceful, comfy, cozy, and clean are what we really appreciate, and all of this and more made our stay very memorable. The furniture, decor, including plants and art are all very quality. Our favorite was the kitchen which has everything a person needs with top notch cookware, (cast iron), pull out cabinets, and many extras. Lauren and Bob have thought of and provided every little detail to make the stay very special. We would like to go back in the spring and/or summer to see and experience Lauren's passion of gardening. Even in the winter, we could tell many hours have been spent planting, grooming, and harvesting. We LOVE the Corvallis area, the strong community feel, lots to do and see, all of what confirms our dream of retirement somewhere in or near Corvallis. Thanks Lauren and Bob."

Stayed a few nights","The Coolidge House lives up to its verbal description, the photographs and the strong reviews. If anything it's even nicer than it appears in the photos. There are so many small beautiful details in the house's interior. The garden is a great space and even the front porch's cushioned bench is a fine place to relax and read. The house and garden are lovingly maintained and extremely comfortable. The one small problem I had at entry (the keypad lock wasn't working well) was swiftly resolved, within minutes, once I let the host know, and the lock gave me no further problems. If you're passing through Corvallis, you can't do any better than to book this place. It works both as a social venue (I had a few people over for lunch in the garden) and as a place to be quiet and meditative on your own. A truly wonderful temporary nest."

Stayed about a week","Nice stay! the front porch is by far the winner with this stay...private and cozy and beautiful little zen garden with a little gate just like grandma's.
Kitchen is super! I baked a cake and make cookies with the fantastic oven.
It is cooled by a window unit (in dining room) and fans which was not a problem because Oregon's humidity levels aren't bad.
perfect for one person needing a quiet retreat.
the place is super CLEAN and scent free, towels and sheets are soft and scent free and clean!!!!
the only challenge is a smaller bathroom...I am 5'2, 150 ish pounds and shower area is tight but certainly manageable...if you are a taller, larger person it could be a challenge.
It takes 5 minutes to get to downtown and river area, 5 minutes from the hospital.
Lauren lives directly behind the house so that side of the house so if you need anything she is right there!
overall my stay was so very nice and I felt safe and sleep well as it was very quiet in the evenings, even on the weekend in a college town. would definitely stay again!"

Not only does she provide the best info and help with anything you can think of, but the fully stocked kitchen and the insanely comfortable bed was more than impressive. It’s perfect for a getaway with your sweetheart, and it’s such a nice little town it doesn’t feel too hustle and bustle if you just want to go walking to look around. I highly recommend staying here if you want a good launching pad to the coast, Portland, Eugene and Salem. Great location and great host !"

The kitchen has everything you could want or need, the small office space has excellent wifi connection, and sitting in the living room in front of the flames of the gas stove sipping frsh ground coffee (they even supplied the beans and the grinder!) is a perfect way to start the day. Two blocks away is Sam's Station -- incredible pasteries and sandwiches and salads -- and a food co-op. You won't need more. The university is a comfortable walk away.

Stayed a few nights","This is a great place for a couples stay. Terrific location, with a great food coop just two minutes walk away, and a conventional grocery store less than ten minutes walk.
The house was sparkling clean on our arrival. Both of us love to cook, so we really appreciated the great knives ( so many Airbnb have poor quality ones) and the cast iron cookware.
Corvallis is a great town to bike in. And within a mile of this house going west, you are in the country. The coast(Newport) is just an hour away by car if you want to explore a bit.
It was really hot a couple of the days we were in Corvallis (90-95 F but no humidity). Between the fans and the air conditioner we were very comfortable on the one warm night that we had.
The house has lovely and mature gardens too, so it’s very pleasant to sit outside too.
We highly recommend staying here!"

We love the garden in front as well, it was very pleasant to sit outside and enjoy dinner. the location is great with a short walk from two grocery stores and the surrounding neighborhood is very nice. We would absolutely stay here again the next time we’re in Corvallis!"

It was a beautiful old neighborhood that felt like you were walking through a food forest of tended fruit trees lining the sidewalks and neighboring yards. I felt safe walking, and it was particularly desirable to have a park 3 blocks away. Lisa's yard was also beautifully landscaped and included outside sit spaces to relax and eat. The unit has a well equipped kitchen. I especially appreciated the natural cleaning supplies in the kitchen and bathroom. The beds had soft cotton sheets and the whole space felt cozy and warm during the damp evenings we were there I would definitely stay again and recommend it to others who are not looking for sterile, over fragrances, stuffy hotels."

We found the location centrally located - an easy walk to downtown (although we didn’t walk given the heat and smoke) and a simple drive for our excursions around and outside the city. It was a nice home away from home :) When we were home we enjoyed sipping wine in the front yard and watching the ever changing landscape.

Stayed a few nights","My stay at Lisa’s Charming Cottage was great! The small house is charmingly “vintage” but well maintained, comfortable and homey, spotlessly clean, and provisioned with most everything needed for a thoroughly pleasant stay. The location was easy to find and perfect for access to all parts of Corvallis. Check-in was easy and the neighborhood is quiet and safe. Parking is on the street but very close, and space was always plentiful. The grounds are well kept and pretty, and the inside was light and airy due to the abundance of windows - all with good coverings for privacy.
The house is divided into a large living-plus-kitchen space, a small but comfortable bedroom, and a small bathroom. A fold-down sofa in the living room provides additional sleeping space, for an overall sleeping capacity to 4. The bedroom has super comfortable queen bed, end tables with lamps, and a large clothes rack with plenty of hangers. There is a big chest of drawers in the main living space adjacent to the bedroom. There plenty of extra blankets and really good pillows. The bathroom is small but well-appointed and there was a generous range of self-care and bathroom-related supplies and other amenities. The shower is a stall style – no tub. The house is cutely decorated, has a cozy living room area with a comfortable sofa, chairs, coffee and end tables, a dining area with a nice table (and good sturdy chairs) that seats 4, and a surprisingly functional kitchen with gas range, full-sized refrigerator, microwave, toaster, coffee pot, plenty of pots, pans, cooking and eating utensils, dishes, bowls, glasses and more. It is not a kitchen for massive multi-course meals but is fully adequate for light to moderate cooking needs. Due to tight space in the bathroom, this is probably not the best place for a very “large” person, or even a very tall one of average build (I am 6’5” and of average build and it was really at the limit for me), but for 90% of the population this would be no issue. Similarly, the lack of a TV argues against it as a location a for a weekend sports viewing party, but Lisa’s cottage is not intended to be a party house. What it is, is the perfect quiet getaway spot for a few days in the Corvallis area when on business, visiting family or friends, or just hiding out.
Alas, I was on business with a full schedule and didn’t have time to visit and become acquainted with my host; but be assured Lisa was always accessible via text or voice call before and during my stay, and she checked with me after arrival to make sure things were going well.
I loved Lisa’s Charming Cottage would stay there again without hesitation. It is comfortable, convenient, and excellent value. If you are visiting the Corvallis area and need something larger and more enabling than a simple room, but don’t want to rent a big house, be sure to look into Lisa’s Charming Cottage - if it is available, go for it; you will not be disappointed."

It was super clean, the bed was comfortable, the heater worked well (it was cold outdoors), the hot water was immediate, and it was well appointed. Also it's a very warm and welcoming place to come back to after a hard day of moving one's mother into senior living. Lisa is very responsive and takes the challenge of running a vacation home with careful attention. The location is very walkable. She makes it clear that it is on-street parking and if you come home at night like we did, you may have to walk for a block or so. To us it was worth it."

It was a great jumping off point to get into the city easily and walk to Woodstock and other areas nearby, which were nice. The Woodstock Farmers Market is great. We arrived late and after dark and it was a little confusing to know which gate and which door to enter, but we found it. Though there's a nice private outside space, it would have been great to have a small grill or little table and chairs or some furniture to sit on out there. We definitely recommend it if the price seems right and you're mostly just sleeping there."

Stayed a few nights","The space is great. All sorts of nice amenities- like extra tooth brushes, earplugs next to the bed, folded blankets in the living room, coffee and tea in the kitchenette.
At night the place was very warm- we turn heat off at night but you need to text the host (they are upstairs) to change the temp. When we did, they did turn it down but we didn't want to ask them to turn it up the next day when the place was cold.
On night 2, there was all sorts of noise coming from upstairs- vacuuming, moving furniture, dragging things across the floor. John messaged us around 9 apologizing- their daughter is unexpectedly coming the next night and they had to get ready but they were done now. The noise continued until 11:45 pm- I asked if we should get a hotel and Adrienne messaged me in part ""We also have made sure there are ear plugs next to the bed"" !?! By 1:45am the noise stopped but we were irritated the rest of our stay.
To their credit, John did offer to refund one day the next day."

The location was super close to our sons apartment and very easy access to the main roads in Corvallis. Hosts were super with communication and the selection of snacks, toiletries, driveway parking and the great directions made things so easy for us. Easy check in with keypad lock.

• Good location
• Very easy to schlep luggage from car to inside Airbnb, a real plus in the rain.
• Extremely clean
• Super comfortable mattress.
• Nice products in bathroom; I covet the non-fog mirror.
• Quiet
• Was offered the possibility of a later checkout.
• Nice to have separate living/bedroom and nice big table to eating, reading, etc.
• Little desk area with lots of charging stations.
Perfect for my husband and me. Great for a couple, but maybe not for two friends traveling together, which I also do a lot, because there's just one queen bed.
Would definitely stay here again. Corvallis is somewhat lacking in lodging options. Hotels/motels are not great and expensive, likely due to being a university town. Other Airbnbs not as nice for the price."

Stayed a few nights","A great stay and one of my favorites in my entire ABNB experience. Adrienne our host was very responsive and welcoming, with a lot of amenities and thoughtful features for such a welcoming stay. While it is not within walking distance to the bustle of downtown it is just a short drive away to neighboring shopping centers and coffee shops."

The bed was extremely comfortable as well. The kitchenette area was small, but made excellent use of the space and had just the right amount of kitchen gear for our needs.

There are special, detailed, and attentive touches around every corner, including the description of the space and area surroundings. This location allows for outdoor walks (greenbelt and path hikes), the feeling of security that an established neighborhood provides (meaning neighbors observe comings and goings), privacy, and efficient proximity to all campus evebnts (if thats why you're in town).
The space was immaculate, comfortable, and easy.
Thank you Adrrienne and John.
I'm (we're) excited for you both as you begin extending to others a space in your home...worried that the secret of this spot will be OUT.
Cheers to all who enjoy this space."

The living area is spacious, the bed firm and comfortable, and there is plenty of light even with it being a basement room. Unless you are used to a lot of walking, you'll need to drive everywhere - and everywhere is 5-10 minutes away. There is a peaceful walking trail just around the corner (watch the poison oak!).
This place is not for you if you need to cook for yourselves or prefer not to hear occasional quiet footsteps overhead. These were not issues for us. The Keurig was much appreciated.
The bathroom is perfect! Small and upscale.
Hopefully the great price is not just introductory."

Stayed a few nights","I was very impressed with Adrienne's apartment. It floats to the top for excellence in the many Airbnb's that I have stayed in - exactly what you want for a delightful short stay, but equally would work for a longer stay. It was immaculately clean, thoughtfully laid out, tastefully decorated and had everything needed for our two night stay. The bed was very comfortable. There were extra towels, sheets, blankets and pillows if needed.
Adrienne had thought to label, or leave instructions for all the kitchenette items - no hunting on the internet for instructions on how to use an unknown coffee maker! She kindly left a bottle of wine in the fridge. Her communication all around was very prompt and she was available in person if we needed anything as she lives on site. Throughly recommend this place."

Stayed a few nights","We had mixed feelings on this one. The location was nice, close to a park and downtown. Mary was friendly and gave good information but we received so many messages regarding our stay from her that could have just been a message or two. There were also messages that “required” a response that could have just been summarized in the beginning questionnaire. It was hard to enjoy the stay with all the messages we had to keep up with. Second, the space was nice. Two bedrooms and lots of room.There was however a musty mildew smell especially on the second floor so we didn’t use that room. Lastly, someone (Mary or the cleaning person perhaps) entered the property without warning during our stay. That made me very uncomfortable. It appeared to be an accident but since we don’t typically use Airbnb it solidified our hesitance to use it again. Overall we had a 3/5 stay. It would have been 4 but the intrusion made us feel less safe/private."

It’s about a half-mile from OSU and a bit more for downtown, but it’s a nice walk. The house was clean and comfortable (and even had a back yard for the pup) and Mary was responsive to whatever questions we had.

Stayed one night","I was only in town for an OSU football game (and no hotels avail) so I really only used Mary's place as somewhere to sleep, so my review is somewhat limited by that. I didn't turn on the TV, didn't use anything in the kitchen. I can say the house was very clean and looks nice, the main beds were comfortable. Kitchen is small but taking a quick look it appeared there would be enough pots, pans, utensils, if you wanted to cook a meal. That being said, there is no kitchen or dining table, not even a coffee table in the living area, so Im not sure where people would eat. There is one small table (desk?) with two chairs. Its a small place so Im sure it was decided to leave a table out as to not take up all the room. Not a bid deal for me, but if you have a family and were planning on eating might be an issue. Parking is a little weird, driveway is very short (my Pilot did not fit) and the street the house is on has no parking. Minor issues. Overall Im very pleased and would stay again."

We moved our daughter into off campus housing and this house was conveniently located within a 5 min walk and/or 1 min drive to her apartment. Very short drive to campus. It's about a <20/<30 min walk to campus/Reser stadium, quicker if you're a fast walker. Lots of people walking around the neighborhood with dogs, which we loved being dog owners ourselves. We would definitely stay, again, with the convenience of the location."

Lovely peaceful backyard, comfortable mattresses, so easy to find things -- everything labeled. Little extras that are not always in AirBnBs -- plenty of kitchen and bathroom towels, laundry detergent, dishwasher soap, etc. The little things that make a stay seamless. Lena was great to work with and we've already looked at booking a couple additional weekends to visit."

The bed was comfortable and the shower water pressure was adequate. There were neat back decks with views of the trees, a cemetery, backyards and the long range view was the city lights of Corvallis. The kitchen had high end brand appliances and was kindly stocked with salt, pepper and napkins. There were Kirkland coffee pods and Folgers coffee provided as well as coffee making appliances. The location was great for getting to OSU in about 10 minutes. I would recommend this place to anyone coming to the area for a short stay. Chelsie let me check in a little bit early which was really nice. Overall, this place was good for a short stay."

Kitchen was great in that it also had some basic staples/condiments and there was even a few pieces of fruit on small eating table.
The only minor negative is since this is a guest house sharing walls with main house sounds can be heard both ways to some extent.
I still give assessment of “great” for the unit, but wanted to point out."

I am so sorry. I left a bottle of milk in the frig. Didn’t realize tell I was to far to come back for. Enjoyed my stay. Had a great time square dancing and am going to try and make next years festival. So you may see me again.
This is the first time I have ever used an Airbnb. So, to be honest what I didn’t like about the booking process was that the price given when booking is not the price you pay. By the time you add in Airbnb surcharge, cleaning surcharge it is far more than the asking price.
But I understand. It’s not your doing. It’s just the way it is."

The full kitchen was a real bonus, something many Airbnb’s don’t offer. Kai and Chris were friendly and responsive to our needs and questions without being intrusive. This is definitely a 5 star offering."

Stayed a few nights","This is a cozy spot. I felt kind of like I was in a cabin even though the unit is (basically) the lower level of a lovely house built into a hill. The box fan the hosts provide is a great amenity if you like white noise. Sometimes you can hear a train in the distance or sounds from around so it can help with that, too. The place was convenient to where my family lived and easy to find. The velvet sofa and metal wall hanging in the living room are lovely."

Stayed a few nights","Chris and Kai’s place was well located and provided a space that felt like my own. I was working night shift durning my stay and the space was VERY conducive to sleeping durning the day. The noise outside was minimal and allowed me to catch up on my much needed Z’s. Additionally, the bed was very comfortable with ample amount of pillows and bedding.
Having a full kitchen was a huge plus! A full size fridge and freezer along with a stove and microwave. I could not have asked for more. Chris and Kai made sure I felt at home and was extremely responsive to any questions I had. 10/10 would recommend this place. Fantastic"

It was very cozy, clean, and has somewhat of a cabin-like, at home feeling. The hosts were very friendly and extremely helpful, as well as very responsive. The vibe was great. My son said he would stay longer only if he could stay at this AirBnb. I'm sure when he returns it will be his first choice!"

Stayed a few nights","This was a last minute stay for me in Corvallis. This Airbnb was just as Chris & Kai described it. The home was clean, quiet, and had all of the essentials needed during my stay. I work remotely and was able to do so from here with no problem! Speedy internet and quiet surroundings made for a great work space. The neighborhood is beautiful, family friendly, and quiet. It's a great area for runners - plenty of roads with little to no traffic. Everything you might need is in walking distance or a short drive.
Chris & Kai were quick to respond when I reached out to them. Their home and surrounding property is beautiful and made for a relaxing few days. I would definitely stay again if I need a room in the area. I highly recommend!"
