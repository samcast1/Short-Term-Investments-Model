The apartment is well-appointed, with everything you need for your stay- including comfy beds, clean towels, linens, a spacious bathroom and nice furniture. Jason was very accommodating to my request and I will highly recommend his place to friends staying in this beautiful, historic area."

I attempted to reach out to him via text message, but it didn't go through. However, when I contacted him through Airbnb messaging, he was quick to respond. I highly recommend this location to everyone! We felt very welcome and at home. Thank you, Jason, for making our stay so enjoyable!"

The place is always clean, it's absolutely beautiful and always clean and free of clutter and it is within walking distance of multiple restaurants and the city park. I've staying there, and it is definitely worth every penny! Thank you, Jason!"

Stayed one night","I really enjoyed my stay here. I think Jason was super proactive and communicative. I will say I got a “we hope you had a nice stay” message through Airbnb before our stay so that was a bit confusing. Jason was super accommodating when I realized I forgot something at the Airbnb and he let me grab it after check out. A couple of things I didn’t expect were the cigarette smell in the building common space (not the unit itself). Of course it’s an old building so it’s not out of the ordinary. I was also worried about parking due to not having a dedicated space but that wasn’t an issue at all. There were spaces in front of the building. Figuring out the heat/a/c in each of the rooms was a bit challenging since each room was controlled separately. And lastly while the towels that were provided were obviously cleaned, they were slightly stained - which made me a bit apprehensive to use them. Overall we enjoyed our stay and would recommend this Airbnb to others!"

Stayed with kids",It's a beautiful place. It's unfortunately on the top floor so you have to climb up 4 flights of stairs which my kids hated and the floor is very creaky because it's an older style house. I wouldn't recommend younger kids as mine wanted to run around a lot and we were afraid of disturbing the tenants under us with the creaky floor. All and all everything was clean. We stayed a week which was a long trip and there are heaters thankfully in each room because it was rather chilly out.

We were able to hang out with our family, cook meals, play games and relax in this spacious space. It was clean, packed with everything we needed and even had a balcony with a view. It was located in a nice area, close to downtown. We visit Hagerstown often and we will be back and will stay here!"

Stayed a few nights","Charming but cold… loved the place but had issues with the heat. (I keep my old house at 68 and it was much colder than that.) Host called HVAC but I found out from them that the issues had previously been reported. Recommend getting confirmation that the heat works well and that the noisy bedroom unit has been fixed (another guest 5 months ago had reported that issue and it hadn’t been fixed). Otherwise, this was a great place - cute, charming, quiet, and close enough to restaurants to walk."

Because we were attending a show at Maryland Theater, it was super walkable and we found a nice selection of restaurants near the theater. The street on which the apartment is located had many beautiful, historic homes and churches making a stroll down the street enjoyable. The covered back porch with a view was a nice surprise."

Stayed a few nights","Jason provided thorough information and details before our stay, which was great! There was plenty of parking directly in front of the house, we never had an issue finding a spot anytime we left and came back. The stairs were fine for us but I could see how some folks might have a tough time, there were quite a few staircases to climb. No issues getting into the building or the unit itself. Upon entering the unit, we notice that the floors weren't very clean, it seems that the housekeeper(s) might need to focus more on that, it look like it hadn't been swept at all and rugs not vacuumed. Otherwise the place seemed to be clean. Shower was nice and roomy and no issues with water pressure during our stay. Was kind of surprised to not find any paper towel provided in the kitchen or tissues anywhere either. Beds were comfortable enough but the AC units in the bedrooms were pretty noisy, we ended up just not using them. Overall, a good stay, but some minor things that could be improved upon."

Stayed one night","Centrally located, excellent shower/bath. Many televisions w/ cable, lots of towels, fully stocked kitchen, comfy couch. Was checking out Hagerstown for a potential job transfer but I’m not sure if the area is for me. Went to bull & bear around the corner, 5 minute walk. We ate outside so we had a chance to see locals walking around and not to be critical but a lot of them looked pretty rough. I wanted to experience Hagerstown for myself and not go off of things I’ve read on Reddit about the area but after closer inspection, those people were pretty accurate. If you’re just passing through, great place to stay. As noted by Jason, on the better side of town."

Great water pressure. Parking was always available. The only thing to consider when traveling is the stairs. Anyone traveling with someone elderly or unsteady on their feet should be careful with booking. But as long as you and your travel partners are still good with stairs, it's not a big deal at all:)"

Stayed with kids","Jason's place was very easy to locate and parking was right in front of the entrance. Check-in was flawless thanks to very specific instructions. The condo was very clean and the rooms were spacious. The kitchen had top of the line appliances and was surprisingly well furnished for cooking--down to salt, sugar, coffee, etc. The bed we slept on in the room with the sitting area was extremely comfortable! The bathroom was amazing and the shower was HUGE! Shampoo and soap were provided and plenty of towels. There is a fire station nearby and some occasional sirens but we heard no noise from nearby units. We found the living room TV and shower door a little tricky to navigate but we managed. Jason was very responsive to emails. We were missing a working hair dryer and a can opener, which he said would be replaced ASAP. Overall we had a wonderful stay and would highly recommended Jason's place!"

The space is very well laid out, with a high-ceiling open kitchen/living room/dining space, two sizable bedrooms, and a fantastic bathroom (the walk-in shower is huge and has two rain heads, and there's a separate clawfoot bathtub for those who prefer to soak). There's even a bench on the back side of the condo with a great view of the city and countryside. It's a great place to stay for those who are just passing through, or those who will be in town for a while."

The architecture of the surrounding buildings as well as the buildings downtown are a hidden gem in MD. If you like vinyl records, I HIGHLY recommend a short walk to Hub City Vinyl. If you are a beer or bourbon fanatic, the Prohibition Hub is an excellent choice. We will definitely stay here again in the future."

You have it very nicely decorated and well stocked...it made us feel right at home We noticed that the light in the shower didn't work as well as the string lights on the back porch. Both of these weren't a big deal, but it would have been nice if they would have worked. We also noticed that the rugs didn't seem to have been vacuumed and this bothered us some. Otherwise the condo seemed very clean and the accommodations suited us very well. I would be happy to recommend this place to my friends Thank you very much for letting us stay at your condo.

Stayed a few nights","The air bnb itself was lovely- super cute and clean. Water pressure was very low. The shower heads worked well, but it took a little to fill the tub since the pressure was so low. Same with the sinks in the bathroom and kitchen. Basically a trickle so it made it hard to wash dishes. Also very uneasy feeling throughout the air bnb. The street it was on was okay, but down the hill (about 500 feet), the area wasn't very safe. Cameras were put on the outside of the doors and I wasn't notified of those, as well as not being notified that there was a fire escape that led straight to the street. Anyone could've had access to the air bnb if they wanted. I was also not notified that the air bnb is on the 3rd floor of the building. Lastly, there was a Nest ""security system"" (thats what it was called when I looked it up) that would reconfigure every once in a while and I was not notified of that either. Lastly, this is a little picky, but the tvs were not connected to wifi so cable was the only option. I do recommend this spot, but do wish I was told about the above things."

We just stopped for a night, but were impressed by the cleanliness and amenities for the price. We loved having access to a full kitchen, and felt that there were hotel like touches (personal soaps/shampoo, availability to make delicious coffee!) We loved going to the Hagerstown City Park. It was so beautiful, and only a four minute drive. (I believe you could walk there as well.) We took our young toddler there and she played at the awesome playgrounds, but it was lovely just to walk around the pond as well. We even caught a rehearsal for the Hagerstown Municipal Band while we were there. I would highly recommend Jason's place if you are spending some time in Hagerstown."

Stayed a few nights",Pictures are deceiving. No water pressure in kitchen sink and sink in bathroom. Both showers do not work only the far one in picture. Bath tub does not have any cold water and hot only comes out in a trickle. So all the things I looked forward to enjoying did not work. Bed is very comfy and air conditioners cool the house very well. Had trouble with Jason answering us with our questions about the water. He did not respond and he lives in another state so he is not there. Wet clothing was left in the dryer and dishwasher was full of clean dishes where housekeeper did not finish her job.

Stayed a few nights","This place was awesome! Very clean and nice looking with every amenity that you may need. The host was very helpful and responsive when I needed to know how to work the heating unit and in accommodating my earlier arrival. Everything was super comfortable. The only drawback would be that if you are unable to do stairs, this might not work out for you, but for me it was fine. I got a little winded over the four short flights but all that said was I need to do more cardio! Lol!
Overall, this was great stay and the host was fantastic. I highly recommend you to book this. I will on my future visits to Hagerstown!"

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed staying at this place in Hagerstown. We knew it was a historic building, and expected the sounds and smells of an older building, but it was nicely renovated and very comfortable. The main living area was nice and open, and the bathroom was a nice size. Being on the top floor did mean there were steps to climb, but there were no other rooms on the same floor, so it was pretty quiet. I would only ask that the water pressure be checked to see if it can be adjusted, but overall we had a really nice time."

Stayed a few nights","Beautiful, bright, clean, historical, rich character, and romantic.
Quality washer dryer, gorgeous bathtub and double shower.
This place is on the top flour, so there are a couple flights of stairs. This adds to the character of the place and wasn't hard to work with at all. Just be aware that you will have to use stairs to get up there. The advantage is total privacy and bright light from all the windows.
We loved this place and it's definitely somewhere we'd love to revisit."

Stayed a few nights","Overall a decent to good stay however there are some things that need fixed/ worked on. I would check with the host to see if these things got addressed before booking. The water pressure in the kitchen is especially bad if you are planning on using the kitchen a decent amount and needing to wash dishes. The bath tub in the picture wasn't usable because only the hot water worked and it also didn't have good water pressure. The shower has 2 faucet heads and only one of them worked. This wasn't a huge deal since we really only needed one to work but its not great to be advertised and then not work. The couches really could be updated because you sank way down into them, seem like they have had their wear. On a good note Jason was very responsive and check in and out was super easy. The location was great. We walked to a small grocery store and to one of the local restaurants. There were other good restaurants in walking distance that we didn't get to try and i could see that once there is a little warmer weather it would be a fun city to check out more. I did not mind that we had to climb 4 sets of stairs to get in our room, the stair sets were pretty short and didn't take long to get to the top. I had seen someone mention in their review about the smell of the place. Being that it is an old Historic building that was remodeled i understand its hard to have a new place smell. Jason did have 1 or 2 air purifiers running that was nice. There still was a slight smell but being that i worked there during the day i got used to it and it didn't bother me. It was nice having the whole place to ourselves and for the price if the few things i mentioned would get fixed i would say it would be a good place for anyone who isn't crazy bothered by old building smells to stay. Also forgot to mention that we got to park right outside of the building every day so that made it super easy as well especially for unloading and loading our stuff ."

Stayed with kids","Overall, this rental has promise but is need of a deep clean and maintenance. Also, we did not feel safe in this location. We’re a family of 4 traveling with grade school kids.
I thought the location would allow for walkability to local cafes, restaurants, etc. The location is technically walkable but we didn’t feel safe walking the handful of blocks and drove for everything. I’m not sure if the neighborhood has been impacted due to Covid and businesses closing, etc.
The interior is renovated but the building itself is very old. We found decor broken and not hung. Also, we found water damage where paint was peeling off the ceiling and next to a window in the living area. The fire alarm was also removed from the kitchen which was a safety concern. One of the shower heads was labeled broken and the other one that is working barely had water pressure. Many of the pots and pans had loose handles.
Also, it caused me a bit of anxiety when I was only given access code info 24 hrs before check in, even after inquiring. I find it more typical for a week advance info. Also, it’s a 4 floor walk up, which I don’t recall in the description. And we had to buy our own laundry detergent which was a bit of a nuisance. Seems like a low cost expense to provide when the washer and dryer were highlighted in the amenities.
So we made due but would not return."

Stayed with kids","We had a great time using Kim’s place as a launching point for skiing at Whitetail. It is less than a 30 min drive from the slopes. The house had three bedrooms upstairs with two full baths and then a half bath on the main floor and a full bath in the basement. Everything was clean and super easy!
We managed to stuff 3 adults and 4 kids in, but it was a pretty tight (not unexpected for a 3 bedroom). I would highly recommend for groups of 5-6. The kids had a great time with the ping pong table in the basement.
A variety of shops (Wal-Mart, Dick’s, etc.) and chain restaurants are a few minutes away by car, so that is very handy.
Overall, definitely would recommend this place!"

Stayed a few nights","My friends and I were very frustrated that we were unable to open the old lockbox and therefore we couldn't get into the unit. It took more than a little time for Kim to call back once I called to tell her we couldn't access the place. Therefore we were an hour late getting to our appointment and after a long drive we had to go to the local Mcdonald's to use their restroom. The king bed in the master bedroom was, I think, made entirely of hard foam. It was very uncomfortable and the king size pillows weren't high quality either. The place is spacious and clean but the sleeping situation wasn't good. My friend in the queen bed said her bed was uncomfortable also. I would not recommend this place."

The place is BEAUTIFUL and looks exactly how it is described. I feel everything you need is in the house as she provides lots of appliances etc. The beds were comfy. My kids loved climbing the stairs to their bedrooms! We loved watching the little ducks in the water & the salamanders under the house. I’m disappointed I didn’t get to see the vultures that every one raves about but that’s not her fault 🤣 We will definitely be back if we are ever in the area again!

Stayed a few nights","Rorke has done an amazing job of renovating this 220+ year old house. It is cozy and quaint, set in a quiet neighborhood. We enjoyed her decorating touches and grew very fond of her Kuerig coffee maker. Since we have family nearby, we will very likely be back. Next time we might even schedule some time to actually relax and read a book or watch a movie instead of running around the countryside."

Stayed one night",The Springhouse is Awesome!!! No complaints whatsoever! Someone reviewed this saying it had a musty smell. I can assure you that the smell here is NOT MUSTY! This is a healthy house; one that has aged well in its 221 years!! The light sweet smell in the home is from the gloriously seasoned original wood in the structure. Will surely stay here again in our travels!

Stayed one night","Really enjoyed our stay at Rorke's springhouse. The historic property has been comfortably appointed with the modern amenities you'd expect without sacrificing any of the original charm. The Airbnb was super well equipped with toiletries, extra towels, blankets, and pillows, and was so cozy and pristine. I really feel the pictures don't do it justice for how nice a stay it was. A few notes that might be relevant for others - overall the area outside of the Airbnb is a little rougher (abandoned homes) but do not let this deter you since the property itself was setback nicely, private, and enjoyable. As a historic home, the staircases are extremely steep/compact, so those with mobility challenges may want to look elsewhere. Lastly, while downstairs stayed quite comfortable in temperature, upstairs did get very hot with the rising heat in winter, so definitely don't be afraid to turn the thermostat down early so the upstairs doesn't stifle. Overall, I absolutely recommend this stay!"

The spring outside running under the house is gorgeous with. lush covering of duckweed and lots of, well, ducks. We had to stay here unfortunately during a loved one's hospitalization and again for their memorial. Both times Rorke was helpful and communicative and flexible.

Even though spring houses were meant to keep food cool, this house was toasty and warm in December, and the water in the shower was hot. The bathroom rugs were the fluffiest I've ever seen. Staying here in the winter was dreamy, private and secluded. The house is pretty easy to reach but felt a world away. I would love to return here. The house is lovely. The stairs to the second floor may be a little tricky for a tall person to navigate, but the lighting is great and there are very firm handrails on the stairs. I had to wash socks and clothes after hauling debris around from the ice storm. I really appreciated being able to use the washing machine and drier in the spring house."

Stayed one night","This is a most unique and interesting place to stay. The Springhouse was clean and immaculate and even the kitchen and bathroom were stocked with the basic necessities! The springs in the basement were the most interesting of all. Definitely check them out when you stay! The beds were very comfortable and we slept quite well! Rorke was very good at communicating with us and let us know she'd be by to spray some wasps outside. We never even heard her, she was so discreet, but the wasps were gone the next morning. :) This place is a true value for the cost also. We will be looking forward to staying here again if we are ever in the area, for sure!!"

Stayed with kids","My family truly enjoyed staying at the Springhouse. It is a beautiful and gorgeously restored historic home. I recommend checking out the Facebook page where you can see all of the pictures of the restoration process. It is very interesting to see all of the hard work that was put into revitalizing this historic home. Check-in was easy and the home is spotlessly clean. When we left, we accidentally left our son’s favorite stuffed animals. Rorke immediately contacted us when she discovered them. We had already driven a long way away, so she kindly offered to ship them to us. However, we decided just to turn around and go back and get them because our son was going to be very miserable for the rest of the trip without them. I highly recommend staying at the Springhouse."

The kitchen was well stocked with everything you might need to make a small meal. We especially appreciated that Rorke got the fire pit and barbecue ready for us.

Rorke has everything you need for a comfortable stay in this 219 year old house. Keep in mind that floors are uneven, staircases windy and narrow, beds on the smaller side imitating the style of the period. It’s really quite wonderful and a treasure you rarely find these days.
How cool is it that there’s a spring running under the house!
But my favorite part was enjoying the porch having a cup of tea and relishing nature."

Lots of character inside and out, with happy cows and great outdoor spaces. Location is perfect - feels like you're private and away from it all, but literally a couple minutes from town/ anything you need. Host communicates well and space feels truly private with the bonus of having host on property for any emergencies. Definitely recommend and will be returning!"

The garden, the spring under the house and the restoration of the house itself were all wonderful. My daughter loved playing on the long front porch, and we saw large families of geese and ducks with so many fluffy babies in the adjacent stream. Wish we had more reasons to be in Hagerstown to stay here :) It was a very convenient spot to stay after picking up my husband from his ride on the C&O canal trail, if there are any bikers looking for places to stay (it would be harder to bike here from the trail because of busy roads however). Can't say enough about how comfortable and beautiful it was, hosts were super helpful and everything about the stay was very easy."

We fell asleep to the sound of the rain on the roof, and got so close to the two sweetest cows just outside in the neighboring pasture. What a joy to be in a real spring house, and it felt like a real patch of spring outside. So nice to be able to walk around the premises and feel like I was in the country, yet so close to the amenities of the city, too. We are so excited to return and tell everyone we know about this little heavenly spot."

Only caveat (besides the stairs which are well noted in the listing) is that the upstairs sleeping spaces, while visually separated (and very comfy-we all slept great) are really more of one room with partitioned nooks. You won't have the privacy you're looking for if you are, say, traveling w kids but hoping for some couple time. We would absolutely stay again but in most circumstances I would want to know this, so heads up. If you're set to just hang out casually, this place is perfect and you can tell the owners have a fabulous time decorating it and a fun sense of history."

Kim is a great host, great communicator, I asked a lot of questions and she would get back to me very quickly. The place is well looked after- very clean, well furnished, and has a lot of character. The main bedroom- I slept so well! Bed is amazing. Room is decorated lovely, ample wardrobe space for clothes, nice shower. The second bedroom was perfect for my 8 and 6 year old to share and the third lounge room upstairs was where we set up the pack and play for the youngest. Also used this room for the kids to watch tv which gave us some breathing space. Everyone slept great. Kitchen well stocked, cooked some nice meals, loved using the chef knives. We didn’t have much time to explore the area as we were bike racing every day but we did go for a couple of walks and the neighborhood is safe and quiet. Found a little playground for the kids.

The lack of instructions caused me to get locked out for over 2 hours the next morning of my arrival. Not having Kim's phone number I wrote to her an email informing her of my predicament. Being on travel Overseas, her husband Walter was kind enough and did very best to help resolve my over 2 hours waiting outside. I also reported an issue with the AC and heating! Strangely, both were working at the same time as the house has an old split system that cools and heats at the same time in a vicious circle! Again, the lack of instructions has retarded the resolution of this issue. I also reported the lack of blinds in the master bedroom which was very annoying mainly early in the morning. When Kim showed up a week or so later, she was unapologetic about all what happened! In summary, I found her tactless, inconsiderate, cheap and terrible!"

Stayed a few nights","What a gem for one or two people!
Spotlessly clean, bright open concept space with good quality furniture. The kitchen is well equipped with high quality cookware and beautiful crockery and flatware. There are no condiments of any kind unfortunately.
The bathroom is spacious with a full size stacked washer and dryer and the hot water was plentiful.
As I pulled up, I was worried about noise because the address is on a major road. The house is set far back off the road though and a row of hedges insured it was absolutely quiet and peaceful.
The unit is well worth your consideration if you're in the area and the host was friendly and pro-active.
A wonderful space"

Owners are very accommodating and very helpful. We had to adjust our reservation due to work needs changing and they were willing to extend our stay. The property is so beautiful and we enjoyed walking the path and exploring. There was so much for our daughter to entertain herself with outside. Living in the city we miss out on that outdoorsy fun for kids. This place offers plenty to do. Nicely decorated and very welcoming. I would definitely recommend this property 10/10"

I loved the play yard and wished that we had our grandchildren with us as they would’ve loved it. Nice touch. We only stayed one quick night so we didn’t really get to enjoy all that was offered. Ralph was extremely helpful when we pulled up with a very empty tank (low fuel light had come on once we got off the highway) and offered to put in the gas he had in his garage. Phew! We might’ve been able to make it to the closest gas station but was relieved that we didn’t have to take that chance."

Especially the homemade cranberry orange muffins and a lovely bottle of wine! It was such a treat to have a nice, clean, and quiet stay while working. My only disappointment....if it's not available the next time I'm in town! THANK YOU!!"

We did however take the local recommendations. We visited the historic store right around the corner and walked the neighborhood to look at all the lovely historic homes. There was even a free music festival downtown. Dominic was very communicative with clear instructions. He even provided a spot to stow our gear. We had a great stay and would love to return."

There was a welcome note and a list of places to go, eat, etc. which was very helpful.
I have stayed at multiple Airbnb's but never have I had an experience this great!

There was food such as yogurt, orange juice, milk, etc. in the fridge, and microwavable meals such as pizzas, pot pies, and ice cream in the freezer. The cherry on top was a container of freshly baked homemade muffins, which were restocked halfway through my stay. This not only showcased Dale's top notch baking expertise, but also showed that the hosts view accommodation as essential and enjoyable to deliver, which is EXACTLY what you want from an Airbnb host. I would rate my stay as a 10/10, and I would replicate it to all future trips if I could."

Stayed a few nights","Dominic and Dale made our stay extra special with fresh muffins, welcome gift and note, stocked frige and catered to my plant-base request. Cozy and well decorated and the hot tub is devine. I loved the plants and orchid. Impeccably clean and delightful extra touches. The mini kitchen has everything you need for a lazy morning hang out and brochures of things to do in the area. Dominic responded quickly to one small repair of the shower head holder after asking us for a good time to do the fix. The neighborhood is quiet, quaint, and walkable with interesting architecture. I wish the downtown was doing better - it is struggling and not friendly to walk. Still we had a great lunch at the German restaurant and hope the community can raise up the downtown. This is close to Fredericksburg and that downtown is very interesting with lots to do. This was just the quiet relaxing private spot my husband and I needed to recharge and celebrate his 62nd birthday. thank you Dominic and Dale."

The interior of the house is very cozy and comfortable, I hope I can decorate my place like this.The only regret I could not have stayed there longer because of the trip and hope to stay there again next time!"

I stayed for five days four nights. The bed was so comfortable. There was fresh baked muffins when I arrived, and the refrigerator was stocked with anything I would need for breakfast and coffee. It was really nice to park right outside my door since I was coming home late at night. I will most definitely stay here again if I need to come back to Hagerstown for business."

We were able to make it for two of our three nights and we were very happy we did. We met Dominic and Dale when we arrived and they couldn't have been nicer. When we entered the suite we found fresh muffins and a bottle of wine- delicious and welcoming. All was clean and uncluttered. The décor was interesting and fun. The bedding was top notch and really pretty, the bathroom was roomy with beautiful separate shower and jacuzzi tub, and the furniture was comfortable and sturdy. Their place is a ""GEM"", and they are very talented ""jewelers""!!"

The extra special touches that they provide make you feel at home while also feeling like you are in a little spa oasis! The home is centrally located and easy to get to anything you would need in the Hagerstown area. Dale’s flowers outside are amazingly beautiful and the little patio area is very comfortable. All of the linens and decor are of exquisite quality. I particularly enjoyed the jacuzzi tub! The countertop snacks as well as the water, juice, and milk in the refrigerator were nice treats…and the frozen microwaveable foods were a pleasant surprise which saved us money from having to eat out all of the time. We will definitely be back and make this our favorite place to stay!"

The bed and bath appointments go beyond comfortable, all the way to luxurious. The kitchen is convenient and spotless. Having a private little deck to relax on is a big plus. But the best part is having Dominic and Dale right there. The welcoming touches in place when you arrive are only surpassed by the good care they take of you during your stay. So many AirBnBs these days are owned by corporate entities, and you're dealing with ""hosts"" who may not even exist. This place is the real deal: a real home, real hosts, real hospitality."

Best part of the trip was when i arrived exhausted and hungry, but too tired to stop somewhere, there was food in the freezer...and ice cream!

The bed was comfortable and I slept better there than I have in months. The suite was quiet. Communication was great. One of the best Airbnb's I have ever stayed in."

Their place is only about 25 minutes from Catoctin Mountain, so my day of hiking was capped with a trip to Upper Stem Brewery (10-15 minutes away— also highly recommended!), a soak in the jacuzzi tub, and some football on cable tv— perfection! I can’t wait to find another reason to visit Hagerstown."

From the home made breakfast muffins, to making sure the Dunkin lover had DD coffee to brew in the morning, the beautiful flower arrangement on the table.

I didn’t know what to expect, but was thrilled to find a sparkling clean, beautifully decorated studio apartment in a quiet, historic neighborhood in Hagerstown. The access to the mature, colorful garden was very welcome at the end of the day. The hosts—Dominic & Dale—were very kind and accommodating, having stocked the kitchenette with snacks and quick meals. They also provided a self-inflating twin mattress for my young son, which made our stay that much more relaxing. Plus, what a luxurious bath! If it hadn’t been 95 degrees out I’d definitely have made use of the hot tub. In sum, this place is a gem, and Dale & Dominic are fabulous hosts. Thank you so much :-)"

Stayed a few nights","If you are going to be in the Hagerstown area, don't miss the opportunity to be guests of Dominic and Dale. Their Airbnb is second to none. The photos just don't do it justice.
The neighborhood has tree lined streets and beautiful homes in a quiet, serene setting but close to all of the comforts of the city. Unfortunately, we didn't get the opportunity to meet Dominic and Dale in person since they were travelling during our stay. Nancy was house sitting for them and was a delightful stand in host. Because the hosts were travelling, they made sure we had everything we would need for breakfast during our stay. The fridge was stocked with fruit, yogurt, apple sauce, milk and juice. The freezer had some ready made options and there were delicious blueberry muffins. There were also snacks, coffee and granola.
The check in process was seamless and we were greeted by fresh flowers along with a personal note. Do yourself a favor and relax in the beautiful jetted tub by candlelight. Then shower off in the spacious shower. After, the beautiful bed linens will call your name. The bed is super comfy and you will wake rested and refreshed.
If I could give this Airbnb 10 stars, I would in a heartbeat. I've been a guest of many units and Dominic and Dale's is the absolute best. Pamper yourself and become one the guests they treat like family."

Stayed about a week","How do I love thee … let me count the ways.
Could it be the freezer stocked with breakfasts, snacks, pizza and one of my favorite libations?
Or the refrigerator with beverages, yogurt, and the specially-requested hard-boiled eggs?
Perhaps it’s the beauty of the garden and outside patio bursting with spring flowers and comfortable rocking chairs.
Or maybe it’s the snack basket with cookies, granola bars and more, as well as a candy jar, refilled with Hershey nuggets when I ate them all.
Possibly it’s the bathroom, with a jacuzzi tub and separate shower with not one but two shower heads and plenty of fluffy towels to wrap up in. Maybe it’s the bedsheets, soft to the touch and so easy to sink into, or the thoughtful lighting throughout the unit.
Ultimately, it’s the downright menschlichit – goodness — that Dale and Dominick demonstrated that made my 10 day stay in Hagerstown a pleasure and a blessing. Thank you for everything ... and a memory that will last in heaven!"

The entire place was immaculately clean, and we felt right at home from the moment we arrived. During our stay, we experienced a snowstorm, but Nikita went above and beyond to ensure our safety by shoveling the walkway and driveway and salting the area. We would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient stay. We stayed here for two weeks for work, and we were thrilled that we didn't opt for a hotel.

I can’t say there’s anything wrong with the place/locale but personally wouldn’t stay again. There’s not much going on in/Hagerstown but that doesn’t have anything to do with the host.

There is even a stocked table for the kids for coloring and drawing. Our 5 yr. old felt special with her own space to create.
