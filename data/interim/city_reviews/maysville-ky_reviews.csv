Group trip","My brothers and I and our spouses have been meeting at a short-term rental property each spring for over 25 years. The Kleier Haus was the best accommodations we have ever had: a beautifully furnished home; four full bedrooms, no pull out beds; ample seating areas for all eight of us; a well equipped kitchen; fully stocked supplies; and spacious grounds."

Group trip","Beautiful home and grounds, peaceful/private location. Host was very responsive. Home was very clean, fully stocked with all of the basics (pans, plates, utensils, etc.) and extras we needed (plenty of paper towels, toilet paper, spices, coffee filters, etc.). Close to Maysville and Augusta where we visited Augusta and Pogue Distilleries. Enjoyed our dinners at Caproni's on the River and the Beehive Augusta Tavern. We thoroughly enjoyed the area and our stay the Kleier Haus. Would stay there again if we return to the area."

Stayed a few nights","This is an old farm house and property with antique decor. There are some upgrades/modern things (bidet toilet, kitchen remodeled), but overall the age is upheld. The grounds are beautiful-I'd love to be the gardener. There are some items that need cleaned or wasted (full basket of used bars of soap in closet, 5 partial packages of baby wipe in bathroom, partially used condiments in fridge) these things make the space feel dirty. Love the rooms decor overall and it reminds me of older days-just waited for housemaid or cook to serve me! The rugs are gorgeous. Bed was comfortable. Thanks for opportunity to stay here."

Lots of extras in case you forgot something at home but also a WalMart and restaurants just a couple of minutes down the road. Everything in this house has been well kept. We will definitely be staying here again

With the Christmas decorations, it made the holiday perfect. We traveled to town knowing a lot wouldn't be open. We found a couple of awesome shops and had dinner at a restaurant on the river. Thank you for a great stay!"

Stayed with kids","Our family greatly enjoyed our stay here. The house is much bigger than I anticipated. I had expected the rooms to be small since the home is older but they are quite large. We were able to fit the twins’ pack and plays in a all but one of the bedrooms comfortably and still had a lot of space to move around.
The host has thought of everything. The kitchen has any appliance or pan you need to whip up breakfast. Clean, soft towels and toiletries in the bathroom. And comfy beds in the bedrooms. Kroger and Wal-mart are close by for any shopping you might need.
My kids loved running around in the large backyard and I enjoyed relaxing on the patio. My eldest loved the house because he thought it was Luigi’s Mansion from the video game.
It was a wonderful stay and if we find ourselves back in Maysville we will definitely be staying at the Kleier House."

If you admire excellent craftsmanship then you will be fascinated by the crown molding. We loved hanging out on the front porch in the evening enjoying the sunset and eating pizza. Overall a nice, convenient location and a really cool property. Thanks!"

Stayed a few nights","This home is very spacious, quiet and private. We enjoyed the large bedrooms and many relaxing spots, both inside and out. Unique decor is fun and since it used to be a bed and breakfast, there are so many cups, dishes and platters to make entertaining a breeze. There’s one large king bed, but FYI the rest are doubles and twin beds (as shown in photos) which feel a little small for larger adults. The home is super clean and very comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay."

Stayed with a pet","This is the second time my husband and I (with our two small dogs) have stayed at this place. The home is furnished with beautiful antiques, and all amenities are as described. The temperature inside the house was comfortable throughout our stay, but Page provides clear instructions on adjusting the thermostat if needed. Overall, we highly recommend the Kleier house if you enjoy a historic home with all the modern conveniences of today, enough space inside and outside the house to provide privacy to guests, and easy access to restaurants, grocery stores, and the historic attractions of Old Washington and downtown Maysville. Page makes you feel like it would not be an inconvenience to ask for help. The notebook left for guests is full of information regarding the property and the surrounding area. We definitely will be repeat guests!"

Group trip","I currently live in Southern AZ. My niece and I planned a week-end trip with my family from Ohio and my BFF from Colorado, we had an amazing time at this beautiful historical home. The pictures do not do it justice. We arrived during the leaf changing. The large trees in the front yard were absolutely beautiful with the golden colors and the fall decorations on the amazing large welcoming porch made you feel like you were at home. What an amazing place to relax and enjoy family time. This place has all the comforts of home. All you needed is your food and wine! We will be back.
BFF comments fm Colorado - This house was great for a small family gathering, the kitchen had everything you needed to prepare a good meal! The home furnishings were beautiful, gorgeous antiques, so many books in the library I just wanted to sit down in the comfy chairs and read!! Front porch was so big and enjoyable! All of the thoughtful amenities placed out for guests to use was very welcoming. Thoroughly enjoyed our time here, would come here again for a nice relaxing vacation, no need to sight see, just be together and savor all the comfort of a well-kept historical home."

Page our host was the greatest answering our questions quickly. The home is well stocked so look around before going shopping. At night there is a symphony of crickets, jar flies and frogs that soothes the soul of a country boy living in the city. We are hoping to do it all over again next year"

Stayed about a week","The Kleier Haus offers you the warmth of a wonderful old home with beautiful antiques and artwork while providing the modern amenities many of us have come to expect. The bathroom on the first floor has a separate shower, a spa tub, and a bidet. The upstairs baths have combination tubs and showers, and there are plenty of towels for everyone. The kitchen is outfitted with a dishwasher, garbage disposal, cooktop, oven, microwave, and many small appliances. Cook pans, casserole dishes, dinnerware, etc. allow you to prepare meals for small or large groups. There are TVs throughout the house to accommodate the varying interests of guests. The large yard gives guests plenty of room for badminton, volleyball, and other similar outdoor games. A golf course adjacent to the Kleier Haus property also is open to guests. A number of restaurants are only a short drive for pick up or dining in, as COVID restrictions allow. We stayed a week, but this location could easily accommodate longer or shorter stays. We were there to visit family and friends, but the surrounding area offers several interesting activities for visitors. The Clooney family--Rosemary, Nick, George, etc.--came from Maysville, so you can learn about their relationship with Maysville over the years. Nearby Old Washington, a 1700's village of shops, museums, tours, etc., is a nice diversion for history buffs and others who are interested in antique furniture and dishes.
We did not see our host, Page, while there, but he gave us several means of contacting him if needed. He also quickly accommodated our request to stay a couple of extra days, even though the extension gave him fewer days to prepare for the next occupants. Overall, we highly recommend the Kleier Haus when looking for a place to stay in Maysville and the surrounding area! LK, North Carolina"

Stayed a few nights","If you're reading this review, it means you're considering staying at Page's gorgeous home, and I'm here to tell you that you should stop reading now, and go make your reservation before somebody else does!
Upon arrival, the outside of the home is humble yet beautiful, with a very lovely covered driveway entrance, which was extremely appreciated during our rainy stay. The huge covered porch is stunning, and makes you consider years gone by, when time went by at a slower pace. The yard and property are beautiful and wonderfully maintained and landscaped.
As delightful as the outside of the home is though, it wasn't until we stepped inside that we were truly appreciative of the beauty of this home. The family room through which you enter is warmly decorated, with big leather furniture, built-in bookshelves, and an electric fireplace. As you walk through the house, you'll find a beautifully hand-carved, curved staircase, a quiet and comfy parlor room, large dining room, huge kitchen, and very large first floor suite. The second floor has three more bedrooms that we did not use during our stay, but were also very spacious and well-decorated.
The entire home is practically presidential in decor, with lots of large oversized mouldings, 9 & 10 foot ceilings, and loads of Georgian/Greek Revival architectural details and decor. The home is so wonderfully put together, you almost forget you're inside of a simple, white farm house.
Lots to do nearby, impeccably clean, lots of little amenities, and an extremely helpful host in Page, make this your greatest possible option for a luxurious stay in Maysville without breaking the bank. Plenty of room inside and out (and parking) for a large crowd, but also quaint, quiet, and well-laid out enough for a simple retreat for two.
Five stars all the way, we will certainly be back!"

The wrap-around porch was ideal for hosting guests, the back porch for BBQing, and the spacious master bedroom allowed for room to breathe. Everything about our stay was top notch and it's an incredible value. I highly recommend Page's home for your family's needs."

Check-in was super easy, as Page's Aunt came to let us in and show us the ""ins and outs"" of the property. The house was beautifully decorated with antiques and family history, but was still homey and had all the amenities needed to keep two teenagers happy. We particularly enjoyed playing games and listening to the record player in the front room and sitting on the wraparound porch in the evening. Absolutely perfect, we hope to be back around the Holidays!"

We wished to check it out and we splurged on this TreeHouse perched on a mountain overlooking the Ohio River with a view for miles in both directions. The stay was perfect. We had way more than everything we needed. it was luxurious. I especially liked a book that was left out about the history of bourbon. Fascinating reading. Try Caproni restaurant. And M's. Drive to neatby Augusta and see Rosemary Clooney's childhood home and dine at nearby Beehive bistro..
I give Barbaras Airbnb 25 stars. Merry Christmas!"

I appreciated the fact that she accommdated me for my disability and allowed me to bring the service that I needed medically (My service dog). I hope we were great guest and will have the opportunity to stay again in the near future. My husband made a great mistake and took the wine opener and I will make sure to replace it today via by ordering one from Amazon and having it shipped to your home, asap.

Stayed a few nights","On average I travel one to two times per month and sometimes feel like I’ve seen it all.
I was so pleased with my stay here & would stay again. I didn’t get in till almost 2am but came “home” to vacuumed plush carpet, waters in the fridge, floor-to-ceiling glass doors/walls revealing a sparkling river & beautiful mature trees. There is a two-level deck wrapped in lights offering several cozy spots to enjoy a glass of wine, a morning coffee with a book, or a small evening dinner party.
I slept so well I actually took a picture of the mattress and pillow labels.
The next day I was able to see all of the owners well manicured plants and flowers all around the property. There were even fresh cut flowers in the kitchen that felt like a big hug! You feel like you kinda know the host when you stay here.
A good majority of Maysville is closed on Sunday’s & Monday’s, but this home gives you a reason to hide away a come back to the world refreshed."

It was clean, comfortable, and the beds were fantastic. It's walking distance to everything in town (a half block from the main street), including the bridge to Ohio, which you can walk over, and yet it's really very quiet. And we enjoyed the back deck as often as we could.
We heard the family downstairs a couple of times, but it wasn't a problem. Their adorable, friendly dog would come to the top of the stairs beside the deck for some attention, and we were glad to give it to him.
I'd happily stay here again if I'm ever back in Maysville."

Our entire experience was characterized by a profound sense of comfort and ease."

Stayed a few nights","Cute and cosy home with everything needed for a comfortable stay. Having a well-stocked kitchen is helpful for self-catering, although there was no toaster. The beds were comfortable and heating was great for chilly days. Having the washing machine and dryer was very handy too. The house is very close to the rail line so there are trains during the night. That said, I didn't hear them by the third night and I am a light sleeper. There are lots of pretty houses in the neighbourhood and the house is walking distance to the shops and restaurants. If you want a tip on where to eat, Sprinkles cafe had a really friendly community atmosphere and Parc cafe felt very French. Both had amazing and well-priced food (it would almost have been cheaper to eat at these cafes than make our own food). Also, if Terry and Mary have Hippie Burgers open, try their food - also amazing!"

Stayed a few nights","Overall, not a good experience for us. To begin, the Wi-Fi at this property is beyond useless. We were there for work & the advertised Wi-Fi had a download speed of 6MB/s & an upload speed of .025MB/s. When we asked about the slow speeds the response was “we’ve never had anyone complain about the Wi-Fi speeds. You can go book somewhere else”.
Due to the idiocy of the locking mechanism on the front door, we were locked out after work at 4AM when it was 20 degrees outside. We spent an hour looking for a spare key & found nothing. Before spending an hour searching for a key, we tried calling the host 5 times with no answer so we were forced to go get a hotel.
Upon returning the next morning, they had left all the doors unlocked with all of our valuables inside. We work in media production, so it was thousands of dollars worth. We also found a brand new key with a brand new wristband lying at the base of the outside stairs.
I also got an INCH LONG splinter in my foot from the floors."

Less than a mile down the road we found a store to stock up on snacks and Propel. Later, that evening we enjoyed watching fireworks from the deck. The only downside which is not the host fault is the close proximity of the railroad tracks. Since we live less than a mile from RR, the sound didn't startled us as much the vibration. The home itself is beautiful and clean. Highly recommend if visiting Maysville."

We had to make them very quick so the tub wouldn't fill up too much. Just a minor issue that I'm sure will be addressed quickly. Other than that, we were very happy with our stay."

Stayed a few nights","Terry's Urban Getaway is located a few blocks from the downtown area of Maysville and provides accessibility to other activities within northern Kentucky while close enough to the Cincinnati area activities as well. Bridges into Ohio are nearby and a vehicle ferry to cross the Ohio River back and forth between the two states is within 20 minutes from Maysville.
The house is clean with all the necessary amenities for a short or long stay including a comfortable mattress, nice linens, and kitchen cookware. There is a plenty of space for a single, a couple, two couples, and/or a small family. Communications were solid/responsive and all instructions were simple and straightforward. A great experience...would highly recommend Terry's place for consideration on your next trip to the area. Thanks again!"

We appreciated all the historical information about the house - so neat to read out the history.

The hosts provided every detail, from entry instructions to house rules (very reasonable) to labels on every light/fan switch (so helpful) to the history of the property and its namesake. And neighbors were very friendly. My only regret is that it was too cold to sit outside either in the porch swing or on the patio…maybe next time we’ll plan better.

Stayed a few nights","Wow, what a great find! Very walkable to everything in downtown Maysville with a great patio overlooking the river. Perfect size for a couple, is on the 3rd floor with stair access only but was fine for us. All amenities provided, very peaceful area, would definitely stay here again if we return to Maysville!"

Stayed a few nights","We had the most delightful girls' weekend at Krystal's house, relaxing and exploring Maysville, Kentucky. Krystal's house is ideal - beautifully decorated, easily walkable to downtown Maysville, comfortable beds, three porches and balconies for relaxing with a glass of wine - we don't have a bad thing to say about the entire experience. The house was easy to find, there was plenty of parking; once we parked the car, it stayed put the whole weekend. Exploring Maysville was a blast, everyone that we met was friendly and helpful, offering suggestions and recommendations for activities we should try. Even better, the food and drinks were surprisingly inexpensive at every stop. We will be visiting Maysville again very soon and will most definitely choose Krystal's house."

Could’ve used more than two wash cloths with 5 guests. Also couldn’t locate any hand towels for the bathrooms or the kitchen after searching through every drawer.
It was a bit expensive for only using it for one night.
All in all I would recommend this property if you plan on staying in the area for more than a night or two."

Group trip","This house is very pretty! The kitchen area has everything you need to cook and host meals you also get some hand towels and dish soap provided and on the table some a cute pot of honey and bar soap sample, the fridge has some complimentary food as well. WiFi is in luded which is very nice! I like that instructions for how to enter the home were given. There is a lovely yard and two balconies one with a dinner table and a smaller one with a little table and chairs. The backyard also comes with two large bikes which is very nice! (Be careful when you come down the patio as there is no step). There is 1.5 bathrooms the shower is loaded with soaps,shampoos, and conditioner which is nice! Clean up before leaving Is easy ( just remove sheets, lock doors, basic cleaning after yourself). The rustic vintage decor was for the most part quite nice. And you get a nice laundry room with washer/dryer Cons of this house; the house is VERY old so it is freezing!! If you're lucky you can stand over the large kitchen floor vents and get a blast of hot air, the lower bedroom door and upstairs bathroom door do not actually lock or close properly so there are door stoppers provided one being a brick, the upstairs bedroom door connected to the media room also doesn't close all the way it's just too stiff same for the laundry room door although the machines aren't too loud. And the only other bathroom is located in the lower bedroom which can be awkward if upstairs isn't available and someone is still in bed. The TV is upstairs in what I refer to as the media room which comes with a pull out bed and chair and a cute table. The t.v unfortunately does not come with cable just apps you can personally sign into or ot movies you can purchase which was a bummer as I accidentally forgot to sign out. I did message the host to ask if she could sign out but I assume she's very busy as her responses are a bit delayed and I still haven't received a response. The traffic is a bit anxiety inducing during the day down stairs but the location is walkable. Overall I'd give this place 3 stars it served it's purpose well (my sibling's marriage)"

Location I gave 4 stars because it was close enough to walk downtown, but also right near a main intersection so the traffic in the upstairs front bedroom was loud all night. It was clean, furnished nicely and easy to get into/park. I messaged the owner twice during our stay (asking her to confirm the parking location and regarding Wi-Fi issues) and did not hear back. The TV upstairs only had apps, not regular channels, which would have been nice for the kiddos. Overall, we enjoyed our stay."

Originally I had booked Friday-Sunday and it was accepted by the host but then added Thursday to the stay a week before realizing Sunday was Fathers Day. The host didn’t accept to refund the Sunday which was disappointing.

The house is very spacious and it is beautifully decorated. If you love old Victorian houses, this is your place. It is currently being renovated. The price was very affordable and the town itself was beautiful. Having drawn this location without much beforehand knowledge we were really pleased to find that people in town seemed very friendly and there were a number of nice cafes and historical buildings. I would recommend this for a little getaway for couples, families or friends."

Also, we struggle with anything but cable tv and had a hard time figuring out how to use TV and to see what channels were available. But someone who streams more may have been fine. The communications were very helpful, easy to get in and any requests for information promptly answered. We would recommend."

Stayed with kids","Emily and Steven’s place was just as they described on the app. It was very reasonably priced and in a convenient location for our needs right across the bridge in Ohio. The place was clean and welcoming. My only complaint within the apartment was the front door being hard to open and close due to the wood swelling, and the hot water ran out very fast. My husband took a quick shower the first night we were there and there was not enough hot water to give my 4 yr old a bath. However, I took a shower in the morning and then was able to give my little one a bath, so the hot water may have been shared with the neighbors the night before. As far as the neighborhood- it was quiet and within walking distance of the cute downtown area that we love, but there was an apartment a couple doors down that had heaps of trash sitting on the sidewalk, so it made the area look run down. Thankfully it wasn’t hot out so it didn’t smell.
Otherwise we loved the space and the area.
We would stay again!"

Stayed one night","These hippies do hospitality right. They seemed committed to helping with anything I needed.
The rental was an excellent value. The space is larger than an executive suite at a hotel, at about half the cost of most standard hotel rooms in Maysville.
The rental included two bedrooms a large kitchen and dining area, and an open television/recreation room linking everything else together.
The linen, furniture, floors, dishes, and sleeping areas were all spotless. I understand they do permit pets and I am sensitive to all manner of pet dander, but amazingly I could not tell that any kind of animal had ever been in the property, which is super rare for these types of rentals.
The location suited my needs perfectly, within walking distance of several restaurants, bars, convenience stores, and the unique blend of shops in Downtown Maysville.
I genuinely hope to have the opportunity to stay with them again."

Stayed a few nights","We loved staying here for the weekend while we were visiting friends. The apartment was super clean and we felt very comfortable with the cleanliness of the sheets and beds. We all agreed that the beds were comfortable, but they are memory foam, so if you're not fan, just a heads up. Also, be aware that this is an older building, so the floors are SUPER NOISY. Our hosts didn't say anything about the noise, but late night walks to the bathroom deffinently made me feel bad about maybe waking them. The space is set up a little differently, but is functional and the living room is comfortable for a movie night while you're visiting, or we even hosted about 8 people and it worked well. Our biggest issue was with the bathroom. The shower is tiny. Like you can barley turn around tiny. It is newly renovated so very nice, just small. My dad also said it was a little slippery, but he was the only one who thought so. Otherwise, we had a great stay and will keep it in mind the next time we visit!"

Steps and access to the building were easier and less step compared to other historical buildings we have stayed in. This Air BnB also had fewer dust bunnies than the older buildings we have stayed in. We had plenty of parking options. We stayed on the weekdays, but we didn't feel like we were taking up any local's parking spots. Town was more quiet compared to other historical towns I have lived in or visited; it was pleasantly surprising! Enjoyed being close to the local eateries, the river front, and talking strolls through downtown Maysville. We are already talking about coming back to explore more and booking the same place!"

Stayed one night","This gem is perfect for a couple or a family or even sharing space. Large accommodations! With two beds and two different types of mattresses to choose from (one soft and one firm), we were completely comfortable!
Charging cords were plugged in next to the beds for ease of use. Everything smelled wonderful. Walking distance to numerous restaurants. (We LOVED Buck's Grill). A quick drive to beautiful Augusta.
Terry had laid out fresh baked cookies, snacks and two different gift certificates for different restaurants.
The ONLY caution I'd place is the shower was very small/tight space. Hubby is 5'9"" & 170# and he had difficulty maneuvering. I am a little shorter, 10# heavier and kept hitting my elbows on the door. HOWEVER. We would STILL opt to stay here again!!!!! Just wanted to caution anyone larger bc it would be a tight squeeze. The bathroom itself was huge. Pretty outdoor area (we didn't take advantage due to time).
Parking right out front. Easy entry too."

Stayed over a week","My husband and I were visiting the town where I was born 87 years ago. Terry, Mary and Jay Hason's ""Hippie Soul"" was absolutely perfect in every way for our two week walk down memory lane. It is located on the edge of Maysville's historic downtown. The home is tastefully and comfortably furnished with a full kitchen, which served us perfectly for our style of travel (light breakfast, snacks and leftovers from dinners in severals of the local restaurants. An excellent breakfast cafe is within site of the house and a very short walk down the street. Although we didn't do much actual cooking or food preparation, we could easily have eaten all of our meals 'at home.'
We were comfortable, happy and enjoyed our central location. Although we didn't need assistance (past the first afternoon when Terry responded immediately) we knew the Hansons were available if needed. Their thoughtful array of snacks and information about eateries and places of interest was greatly appreciated."

Other than that it was a wonderful place and we have recommended it to several people.

Stayed a few nights","Really great little place in the heart of Maysville. Great communication from Terry before and during the stay. Things we loved are the beds (!), character & charm of Hippie Soul, snacks, coffee, treats and gift cards (we enjoyed deSha’s!), and location. One night we walked to Caproni’s for dinner and that was so pleasant. The mini bar was very well stocked and fresh cookies didn’t last long after our day of driving. We loved the night lights in the kitched and bathroom outlet. The outside patio area is really nice and the desk was convenient!
Things to note at Hippie Soul: no central heat/air but plenty of little heating units and fans; you might hear dogs barking if the people below leave; the bathroom itself is quite large but the shower stall is tiny - I’m 5’10” 185 and had a hard time showering. Also you might bring a power strip to plug in your electronics. One bedroom had only one outlet which was inconvenient.
Internet worked without issue and TV/Roku was perfect!"

Nor did I sleep comfortably knowing that the room wasnt completely secure. This isn't the greatest of neighborhoods, there was a guy sleeping in his car across the street so I wish there was better security. That's my only complaint, otherwise the apartment is amazing inside."

The rooms are spacious, and comfortable. Terry has thought of everything you might need, right down to a cooler of soda, beer, and wine for purchase. Lovely presentation of wine glasses, bottle opener, etc.
This is an older building with tall ceilings and windows. The layout is quirky, with the bathroom on the hall landing outside of the apartment. It's easily accessible and still very private. The apartment felt very safe and secure with the coded lock entry. Terry is very quick to respond to any questions that might come up.
Highly recommend this property for anyone visiting Maysville."

Stayed with a pet","My wife and I were traveling back home to Chattanooga, TN from a wedding we had attended in Dayton, OH. So we were just looking for a small town in between where we could stay a few days, check out the local downtown, and rest some.
So Maysville was perfect for us. We were pleased to have found David's place just off of the downtown area. It was in a perfect location to head out by foot to see and do everything in the downtown area.
The location was very restful in a quiet sense. If you wanted to cook, he has provided a well-stocked kitchen with plenty of cook pans, utensils etc. The WIFI worked well, the TV used a Roku which worked great for us.
Bottom line, if you're looking a place to get away, Davids's place would be perfect to hang out while visiting Maysville!"

If you have never visited Maysville, you owe yourself a trip! Stay here in this lovely 1940's completely updated home and you might never want to return home!

As we were on a history visit, it was a great location to visit the Historic Maysville - Mason County Cemetery with the beautiful old stones and memorials. Around the corner was the Duke's Petting Zoo, a well cared for collection of animals: Camels, emu, deer and much more to enjoy with children of all ages. Then of course, being close to historic downtown Maysville, with its collection of beautiful homes and historic buildings was something to enjoy on my daily walks. Of course the visit to the Kentucky Gateway Museum with its helpful staff, was a great help with my research."

Stayed a few nights","The place was clean, easy to find, and easy to check in. The back yard in a giant cemetery. That would be why it’s so quiet with the surroundings. People in the building did not stay the entire time but when other people were in the building you could hear everything that was going on. My main problem was the host. They did let me check in early the first morning because I’m a night shift nurse. They made me pay for an extra night at the end saying me leaving for work at 5pm wldnt give them enough time to clean for the next tenant. I ended up having to leave a day early and requested to change my date at 5pm the deadline for change was at 3pm. (which they knew I work nights and not awake at 3pm) the host denied my request and kept my money for two days I was not there. I would not use this person ever again solely because of their character. Every host I’ve ever had in the past has always worked with me with a night shift schedule, no problem."

A few little hiccups checking in but Robert was very responsive and took care of it immediately.
Beautiful home, very spacious, hot tub was perfect. Loved just relaxing on the deck watching and listening to the birds.
Beautiful meaning behind the home, Thank You!"

The kitchen is extremely well-stocked and Kroger is just 20 minutes away. The love and feeling of home is palpable and made the experience even better. We brought our dog and he enjoyed the trails around the house as well as the local nature preserve. If you are looking for a relaxing retreat, this is the place. And the jacuzzi is the cherry on top! Would stay again."

Stayed with a pet","We loved our getaway at Minton, like some others have said, it wasn’t long enough and we wished we had booked two nights instead of three! Plenty of space for all of us, our 5 dogs, and their crates. We really enjoyed walking on the spacious trails in the woods and using the hot tub. The kitchen, grilling, and smoking supplies and equipment were very well stocked. We also really appreciated having access to a full washer and dryer. Do heed the host and other’s warnings about the driveway, we stayed at the end of October and a lot of new gravel and rock has been recently poured so our AWD Honda CR-V and Jeep Compass did great with a good amount of acceleration and we left our sedan with low suspension inside the gate at the bottom of the hill to be safe."

Stayed with a pet","If you are looking for nature and solitude then this is the place! We loved every moment of our stay (well most of them...thunderstorm knocked out the power and boy was that scary!) Then sitting by the bon fire we heard coyotes off in the distance, about 45 minutes later something was walking in the tree line near us sending us all running inside like scared children! We made great memories here! (By the way, we are pretty certain it was a deer, but after hearing the coyotes our kids would have believed it was Big Foot!) Only downside is the driveway. If you don't have 4x4 don't even bother. You won't make it up the hill. The bottom of the driveway is in serious need of a couple loads of gravel. There are security cameras and trail cams. The owner does give permission to cover them with a washcloths, however, the ones out front are in a position that they can not be covered. The owner communicated well and we found the place well stocked and clean. Because we have 4x4, 5 star stay for sure!"

Stayed a few nights","This was our second stay at this cabin and it was just as wonderful as the first! We almost were snowed in because of Storm Izzy, but managed to make it down the driveway thanks to a solid 4WD vehicle and growing up in the snow belt. We were thrilled to experience the cabin during the snow though, it is truly peaceful and breathtaking. The WiFi was temporarily down during our stay but that didn’t bother us at all. We brought dvds incase the cable was out, it wasn’t, and a portable fm radio to listen to music while in the hot tub. We tend to do a lot of reading and crafting while at the cabin anyways. It’s all about decompressing and relaxing!! We will be back again soon! :D"

Our worries melted away immediately upon entering and we truly and deeply relaxed over the course of our stay. The cabin has every comfort we could ask for, but most importantly, it was peaceful. We had soft serene mornings enjoying tea and coffee on the deck, warm lazy afternoons in the main room working on a puzzle we’d never finish, and gentle evenings stargazing around the bonfire making s’mores. A truly lovely place for people who could use a little serenity and time and space to heal the soul."

As for the place, the driveway is steep! All 4 cars made it, but it was completely dry. Had there been rain, I don't think we could have made it. We pretty much hung outside the entire trip, weather was awesome! There's a fire pit, 6 camping chairs, hot tub, and a few more seating places out back.
