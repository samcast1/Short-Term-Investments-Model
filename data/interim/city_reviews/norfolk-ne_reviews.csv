Stayed a few nights","My parents and I were attending a graduation and wanted something more comfortable than a hotel room. This house was perfect for our needs. The beds and linens were so comfortable, the kitchen had everything we needed, the windows all through the home were exquisite, there really was nothing Danielle had not thought of. The furnishings and accents were on point and tasteful. For me the ideal AirBnB is a space that could be your second home. A space that feels like it could be yours - comfortable, well-appointed, and peaceful. This house was all of this."

Stayed a few nights","We loved this home. It provided every need we had for this trip. It was beautifully decorated, the kitchen had ample supply of updated cookware and appliances. The laundry room had everything we needed and same with both bathrooms. The place was very clean and and made me feel comfortable and safe. The bed was very comfortable. I travel with a bedtopper and sheets and did not need them. We loved all the windows and looking out from the hilltop down to the city lights. We also enjoyed walking the neighborhood each day to get some exercise. The one car garage was perfect for our mid size suv. It has a large back yard that we could enjoy with kids or a dog, play some lawn games etc. The host was very responsive and had a welcome brochure with local restaurants and activities etc. We loved this place so much, we are booking it for a family reunion event coming up this summer."

The view out the East top floor living room windows is breathtaking! I would love to stay here again, and will book this house if it is available on our next trip to Norfolk."

Stayed a few nights","My original reservation was cancelled by AirBnB the day of! I received notification whilst on the road. I was able to book this beautiful cabin on short notice and it exceeded my expectations.
This cabin is close enough to town to be convenient, but just far outside of city limits to feel remote. The cabin was spotless with every amenity I could have asked for.
There were plenty of nightlights, K-Cups, even foil and baggies. The beds and pillows were top notch. I enjoyed sitting on the porch, having a cuppa and watching the sunrise over the prairie.
My stay in Norfolk was enjoyable!"

Stayed with kids","Beautiful log cabin just outside town that gives you a taste of country living with convenience. The landscaping and sun room were a beautiful bonus. The home was very clean with a lovely, unique layout.
While it did not bother us, the upper level master bedroom and bath lack privacy - as the bedroom has no door. Walking up the stairs off the family room offers a view of the bed. The bathroom door does not lock and has a sliding farmhouse/barn door. We let our children know to announce themselves before coming up the stairs and really had no issue, but this may be something to consider for some parties.
Elizabeth was fantastic and very responsive. We would highly recommend this property and will definitely be back!"

Stayed a few nights","I COULDN’T IMAGINE BRINGING KIDS HERE FOR ANYTIME, WITHOUT A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE!
I travel for a living. I stay in a lot of these types of establishments, and I also bring the entire family to vacation in places like this. NEVER have I had a bad review or had to leave one.
•3 overnight guest in total including myself, but I was treated like we were throwing a party. ( we choose to stay there to ride atvs at the local track)
They watched the place constantly, and noted who came and went.
•They complained about how I left the place, even though I went through and picked up 99% of our mess for them. Including: putting dishes in the dish washer, collecting all dirty laundry into a basket, and left the trash bag outside.
•They also are trying to charge me for surface scratches on a few chairs ( literally the area your butt sits on.) my 2 roommates left after night 1 and I went solo the last night.
Cabin, communication, ease- 8/10
Whatever is going on here - 2/10"

Took a quick trip to Norfolk (15min away) to grab some food supplies on the first day. House was very clean and bed was super comfortable. Loys of homey touches throughout! Really enjoyed meeting Howie, the mini beagle. What a sweetie! Thank you for a wonderful stay."

Stayed with kids","Wonderful stay. I stayed here for a month while visiting family and Diane's place was a great value. Great location close to Norfolk (~15mins), comfy home, and beautiful surroundings. It was safe on the property and even though it is a working farm it was relatively quiet. Everyone I met on the property was friendly and caring. I would totally stay here again and recommend to others.
Quick story - I am not from the midwest, so my first week there was a crazy thunderstorm that hit overnight with a tornado warning issued in the area. I was sleeping like a baby when this was all happening, and Diane had the forethought to call me at 1am to let me know that I needed to get into the basement for safety. I was freaking out and she helped calm me down and guided me to find the basement I had not bothered to find previously. All was well and we were safe, but the next day her and her family took care of cleaning up the branches in the aftermath and checked on me. Seems kind of silly to share, but it says so much about a host who not only takes care of the property, but also guests."

Stayed a few nights","Windmill Cottage is a delightful place to stay. It is surrounded by beautiful trees and fertile farmland and is so nice and quiet and peaceful, yet close to both Madison and Norfolk so that you can quickly be in town enjoying restaurants and movies and parks and walking trails and shopping and more. The house is clean and wonderfully decorated in a way that brings back so much nostalgia for simpler days, while having all the modern amenities you may desire. The value of what you get for the cost is amazing, the host is very wonderful and responsive with communication, and you will find yourself enjoying a very comfortable, peaceful stay if you choose to come here.
On a lighter yet important note: I've never stayed anywhere that was so well stocked with bath towels and face cloths and toilet paper for your bathroom needs. In fact we were all talking about how we always traveled with extra supplies because the places we would stay would be so meagerly stocked. Windmill Cottage looks out for your needs and comforts!
We will definitely stay again and we've recommended it to family and friends and will continue to do so. We can't wait to come back again."

Staying in a hotel will never compare to the feeling of HOME. Thank you so much again.

Communication was excellent. The home was very large, with two separate family room areas, and had several televisions. The area was peaceful overall and felt safe (except we were surprised that the patio door to the screened-in porch wasn't locked). The bedding was nice and the kitchen was well stocked with utensils, etc. (except we didn't find scissors). The jetted tub was nice and the bathrooms were clean/fresh! Thank you for the stay, Ethan and family!"

The sitting room was a great gathering spot for conversation, games , and just enjoying being together . If our grandson could handle long drives he would have come and enjoyed all the toys , animals and outdoor games. The room darkening curtains available to hang were really important for the light sensitive adults. 4 of us went out for morning runs down to the river and /or through town. Great location for Norfolk. Tami was very nice and responsive . Highly recommend."

Stayed a few nights","So it’s not the worst place. I felt okay coming in the first day but afterwards I felt unwelcome and very uncomfortable. If I’m being honest, it could be because I’m black because it was as if they were surprised and disappointed in accepting my booking. I totally understand that it may have been weird because the majority of the town is caucasian so I’m not upset or anything. After the first day I said hello a couple times to Jessie and she didn’t respond. The bathroom is listed as just for me but it was used by them during my stay as well. Also, no where does it say that she has a pet, all I saw was pets are welcomed but it wasn’t clear that she has a dog. The bed had crumbs or dust on it and underneath the bed was a bag of open chips. So I did my best to avoid them so everyone would feel comfortable and I just did not extend my booking like I wanted to originally. Also, the ceiling in the bathroom is open showing all these pipes, and the waters consistency is not very clean. 4/10."

Stayed one night","Really great place to stay--we slept great, and felt attended to as needed.
They managed to keep all those kids quiet for us, too, which was great.
The kids were the best part--beautifiul home schooled kids who were polite, inquisitive, informative, and just really lovely. My one regret is that we were so late in arriving, and so behind schedule in leaving in the morning, that there just wasn't time to spend talking to the kids like I would have loved to have done. The one even sang to me as I walked through the kitchen to the basement stairs. SO sweet.
Their parents were really easy going, left us alone to get done what we needed to do, found us their clothing ironing table to use, and let us put our water bottles in the freezer for our cooler the next day.
All around, a great place to stay."

Gina was helpful in getting us checked in and letting us know anything we needed to know. She was next door and willing to help at any time. She was a perfect host.
This house is being worked on, so it was a little alarming at first when we arrived, but as soon as she explained they were working on it but the inside is done and beautiful. My kids loved it. Everyone had their own space, and I had enough room to make a Thanksgiving dinner for my kids. Just a super cozy experience!
I am so thankful I found this place last minute!"

Stayed with kids","We just needed a quick place to sleep and eat breakfast for our family of 4 (kids ages 3 years and 11 months) for an out-of-state wedding. Travis’ place was quick and easy to book, his check-in instructions and communication before-hand were clear and thorough, and his space was well though out for families of small children with minimal clutter and kid-friendly furniture. He went as far as to provide a baby bath insert and baby-specific bath products and had offered a pack-n-play based on our booking details. We were also pleasantly surprised to find out we were able to park in the garage. The home was stocked with some complimentary snacks, toiletries, and lots of other perks we didn’t have time to utilize. It was one of the cleanest places we have stayed. Overall it was very cozy. If we ever found ourselves in Norfolk again we would for sure check for this listing first! Thanks, Travis!"

Stayed over a week","This place was exactly what we needed for 2 weeks of work in the area. Kitchen and bathrooms were welled stocked for all of your needs. The place was clean and organized. The washer and dryer was a nice addition. The garage was an added plus since the weather was icy/snowy at the time we were there. The water softener quit working while we were there which resulted in low water pressure. Travis was very responsive and had the issue fixed within a few hours. If the size and space that is advertised fits your parameters, this is definitely the place to stay! If work takes us to Norfolk again, we will be checking to see if this place is available. Thank you Travis for a great place to stay!"

This will always our home away from home every time we come back to town. I highly recommend Travis and his property."

Stayed a few nights","Travis’ rental is a really nice and comfy place to call home when you can’t be home. Also felt very safe. And it’s a quiet neighborhood. Great location, just minutes from anywhere in town. Several places to eat are just 5 minutes away: Tu Casa Mexican restaurant, Sakura sushi restaurant, Franklin’s family restaurant, Godfathers Pizza, Subway, Dominoes, Burger King and McDonalds and a gas station just down the street. The house is cozy. The couch in the living room is SO comfortable. A person could easily sleep there; as a matter of fact, I took a nap there. The bedrooms are nice and big and having a master bathroom and closet is a plus. Something that I find a problem in some rentals I’ve stayed in is water pressure, especially in the shower. Not so much here. The water pressure was fantastic! And plenty of hot water. The kitchen had about everything we needed for a short stay. The patio was a nice place to sit with our morning coffee, which, btw, the coffee was provided. Even met one of the neighbors while sitting there. Everyone we encountered in the neighborhood was friendly and helpful. It was great having a two car garage, too. All in all, it’s a great place and a great alternative to a hotel, in my opinion. Much more affordable and private. Travis is a great host, too, and he was quick to respond to any questions we had. Much appreciated. This place meets our approval and we highly recommend it."

Wooden floors in living room and a kitchen, but nice carpets at every bedroom. Great and comfortable furniture with perfectly equipped kitchen. You have everything for feeling like you are at home. Will be good choice for couple with or without children. Location is quiet, 2 minutes from nearest Hy-Vee store and 5 minutes from restaurants. If you are travelling with the kids - the Waterpark is in 1 minute walking distance.
Danielle is a perfect host who was helpful during all our staying at her place. She provides everything you may need - at the first day she asked if anything missing - next day she supplied the every single item I mentioned to her.
I definitely encourage you to stay at this house if you are planning to travel to Norfolk, NE."

My son, (the graduate) parked his car on the wrong side of the street the first night; the next door neighbor pointed it out the next day. This instruction is listed in the “house rules”, but because of all the excitement of the why we were in town, it was inadvertently overlooked. The kitchen was clean with lots of pots and pans, nice dishes and glasses. The beds were comfy and the linens & pillows were clean and soft. The bathrooms were super clean and stocked with nice, fluffy towels. The view from the deck is just fabulous! The host did a great job with making us feel welcomed and at home. Gretchen, all the best to you & your family!"

Group trip","This home was beautiful and perfect for our needs! The home was very clean, well decorated, spacious, beds were comfortable and there were extra blankets in every room. It snowed over night for our first night stay, when we woke up in the morning someone had shoveled and salted the walkway and front porch to avoid any falls! Gretchen was also great and friendly! We didn’t have a need to reach out during our stay but I have no doubt she would have replied right away just as she did leading up to our stay! I would definitely recommend this home!"

Stayed a few nights","Gretchen’s place is in a great location, in a nice neighborhood, close to restaurants, shopping, even the hospital. I loved that it was close to SkyView Lake where I walked to and around in the mornings but there are other activities a person can do there too. The place, itself, is fantastic. Gretchen has thought of every detail to make her guests feel at home and safe, not to mention, her impeccable decorating skills. The place is gorgeous. Each bedroom is decorated so uniquely and cute and the bed in the master is the most comfy mattress we’ve slept on in an Airbnb. It may be the most clean Airbnb we’ve ever been in, too. We enjoyed our stay there and highly recommend it. The only thing that would make it even better, would be access to the garage, especially during the winter months. Otherwise, we appreciated the security lights in the driveway."

The house was a perfect meeting place for out of town family and friends from the surrounding towns. It turned out to be the perfect spot to watch the Super Bowl together! We stayed a month in town and I would highly recommend it and will be back our next visit to Norfolk.

There is only one mirror in the house--in the bathroom, so it did get tricky to share one mirror when getting ready. The mattresses are very firm--didn't bother the others in our party, but it did cause me some aches and pains. Overall though, met our purposes well and appreciated the great price."

Stayed with kids",This place was so nice to stay in. The other reviews were right about how clean it is. From the carpets to the kitchen sink to the bedrooms and bathroom- super clean. I really appreciated that. The house is deceptively much larger than it looks on the outside. Checkin/out was non contact and a breeze. There wasn’t a lot of extra rules and that provided for good mutual respect in my opinion. They respectfully cared for and cleaned the home well and I felt the responsibility to respectively keep it nice without all the extra rules most places put on the renter. I’ve already told my extended family about this home as a potential rental option for them when visiting.

Host does not supply shampoo/conditioner/body wash so be sure to bring your own. First place we’ve stayed years that doesn’t provide these items so didn’t think to ask in advance.

I sent a note regarding a need on the weekend that went unanswered. The lodging guest amenities you count on, like salt and pepper, Kleenex, toilet paper, microwaveable dishes, were missing or depleted fast.
I’m sure this unit will be a great place to rent for families especially. They just need to ensure all items are available."
