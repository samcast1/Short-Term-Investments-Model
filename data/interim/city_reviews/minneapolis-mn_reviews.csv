Stayed a few nights",Perfect for what we needed for a guy's getaway. Simple and had all we needed. Internet was generously fast. Main bed was big and clean. Floor was really creaky just outside the bedrooms. Bathroom lacks a fan so open a window to allow steam out. Street and neighbors were quiet. Relatively close to downtown Minneapolis and the U West Bank. Great value!

There is a huge kitchen and tons of seating and the beds were so comfortable. I feel bad that we came home late after the concert because the floors are a bit squeaky but the home is just so cozy, nice, and private. The neighborhood has tons of cute restaurants, coffee shops, and the house is next to a really great park. I will definitely be back!"

Stayed about a week","I have done a lot of Airbnbs, and many in the Twin Cities. This was, hands down, one of the best experiences I ever had. We needed flexibility and we needed space for 10 days for me, and then for some of that time my adult child, and then my husband during the weekend. There was plenty of space for us all and the kitchen was so well stocked, I did a lot of cooking there and could not have been more pleased. I also was working remotely and found the desk in the living room perfect to work at. I felt so at home, living like a Minneapolitan in a convenient neighborhood to a lot of things -- grocery stores, Target, liquor store, an Ethiopian market. I was so sad to have to leave, and in fact, I had to switch to another Airbnb -- same price point approximately, but so lacking in everything that made William's place wonderful. Finally, I never met William but I did have two conversations with Mrs. William: she is kind, compassionate, a lovely person. A great experience. Worth every penny."

The rental was very easy to find and the instructions to get inside were very clear. Even though the MN weather was a bit rainy and cold, the space was perfect to lounge around when we were rained out. It was such a cozy spot to hangout and watch some movies. When we were able to get it out, the central location made it really easy to explore the city and we appreciated the off street parking. Overall this place really added to our first trip up to Minneapolis and we will keep this place in mind when we return- thank you for hosting us!"

Stayed a few nights","Bright, sunny, quiet spot tucked away above the home's unattached garage. Roomy for two of us. Very nice bathroom with deep tub and great shower (although the sink is so high up on the counter that at 5'2 I had to stand on tip toes to brush my teeth and wash my face). Cozy living area with a gas fireplace and comfy couch. Full size fridge, Keurig with coffee pods. Stove top (also very high up) and oven. Given that our daughter lives half a mile away, it was easy to walk to her house as well as to walk to Lyndale and take advantage of the shops and restaurants there. Again, so quiet and peaceful. It really does feel like you're in a tree house. Ceilings were higher than I expected from photos. Very open feel. I would definitely stay there again and already recommended it to a family member planning a visit."

The place itself is adorable and very clean. Comfortable bed and couch for lounging. Access to laundry. One off-street parking spot available. My only complaint is that the apartment did not come with a resident cat as pictured ;) —just kidding. We had a lovely stay in this unique space and would highly recommend!

Although it is above a garage and facing an alleyway the house is so well designed and built that it is very private and quiet. It really is like living in a treehouse. Also, enjoyed the owners collection of art books and great design. The bathroom is lovely, with several different jets and settings for the shower. The laundry area was convenient and so well insulated that although next to bedroom the sound doesn’t disturb in anyway. The sitting area overlooks the backyard and the deck was a great place to sit and enjoy coffee or a meal. The kitchen in well stocked with new very nice appliances. Anyone interested in small unique well designed spaces will love this place. My husband and I stayed here for a week while visiting our daughter and her fiancé who live in Uptown. Very convenient to shops and cafes. Loved it"

Stayed a few nights","Cozy stay! The place is as advertised. Fireplace was a cozy spot to read a book, watch football, and clean up some emails. Bed and pillows were comfortable. Street parking is in front of the house, so it is a little bit of a walk to wind your way to the backyard. Nice restaurants nearby. Owners were very responsive to all of my questions. I would stay again."

Tons of stuff and easy walk away, but far enough from the busy streets that you aren’t dealing with the noise or traffic, etc. Would recommend!"

It's very well decorated, decently supplied kitchen, comfortable day bed in the living room and comfortable queen bed in a bedroom with French pocket doors. Having access to the washer and dryer with a big closet to unpack was excellent. The shower has a nice deep tub with wall sprays.
Thank you for the great stay and we would stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","A very nice apartment perfectly located. We loved the design of the space. Not the fault of the hosts --- but a pesky neighbor has installed prison yard floodlights that point right at the bedroom windows and are triggered by alley cats all through the night. I think the hosts are going to need to install black-out blinds. We had to find sleeping masks - which surprisingly, was no mean feat. Otherwise a lovely stay."

A bit of a smaller space so ideal for one person, but could work for a couple too. Never had issues getting off street parking, but is a bit of a walk if you have multiple suitcases/items to haul. Very quiet which was great and perfect space to relax in at the end of the day."

I very much appreciated the abundance of pillows in the beds and the extra blankets (super soft and fluffy) that were available in the closet. Neighborhood is safe and quiet. Angel was very communicative and the instructions for entering the home and garage were very clear and easy to follow. Will definitely book Angel's place again, if its available the next time we visit Minneapolis. Thanks, Angel for a wonderful stay!"

Even little added touches of having coffee grounds and ice was really nice. Coming all the way over from the UK and it still felt like home.

Stayed a few nights","Alexandra’s flat was a great way to be in the middle of beautiful Minneapolis. Shopping, bars, restaurants were all within a 5-10 minute walk. The neighborhood felt very accessible and safe. Easy access to the West River Park was also a huge plus.
The flat is within a historic block-long building. Brick-clad with a modern build-out. The space had lots of old-world charm as evidenced by raw beams, brick walls and original window openings. Mixed with updated flooring, furnishings and fixtures.
The space is a perfect size for 4 friends spending the weekend together. Kitchen was useful and the bedrooms were spacious with plenty of closet space. Bedding is soft and the mattress was lovely. Slept like a log.
Alexandra was a wonderful and accommodating host. Communication was a breeze and she made every effort to accommodate us—checking in from time to time to ensure we were enjoying our stay. As a host, myself, Alexandra was one of the best we’ve stayed with. I’ll be back for sure. 💯"

The kitchen is well stocked though we didn't cook. It was the perfect location to walk to a variety of cafes and restaurants. Alexandra included the touches that many places miss - plenty of towels for all of us, including hand towels in the kitchen, a full length mirror in the bedroom so we weren't all vying for the bathroom, a hairdryer *with diffuser* (fellow curlies, iykyk). Her communication and instructions ahead of time were perfect. Other reviews mentioned the thin walls and they're not wrong. We heard our neighbors pretty clearly the first night. Having said that, the building was very peaceful and we had no problems with noise during the night. If you're a very light sleeper, consider bringing earplugs or using white noise on your phone but don't let it deter you from taking advantage of this great space."

The apartment itself is great, with a lovely kitchen and living space as well as two bedrooms and a spacious bathroom. The kitchen was well equipped if you want to do any cooking, and coffee is provided, which is fantastic. One thing to note is that one of the bedrooms doesn't have a ceiling, so it's less private and sound will travel to/from the kitchen and living room. It wasn't a big deal for us, but it does limit the quiet spaces if someone needs to get away and work or something. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and having Alexandra as our host!"

Alexandra communicated about the situation just before we arrived, but it was not repaired during our stay. There is a lot of light from the parking lot, which with the missing blind makes the room too bright for comfortable sleeping. Once the blind is fixed it will be much improved. The mattress and pillows are very comfortable."

The only thing I was concerned with after reading reviews was being able to hear your neighbors. It turned out to be true, we could hear our neighbors well after midnight. We had to use white noise to help us go to sleep. However, I was prepared for that after reading others experience with the thin walls.
The unit was still great!"

A little park and walking trails along the Mississippi were just down the block, and the loft was walkable to great coffee, restaurants, and even a little quickie market conveniently nearby. Plus, very easy parking right at the unit. Alexandra was instantly responsive to every question and she has a binder full of excellent tips about local places to eat and drink. She just made us feel generally taken care of. I would recommend this loft without hesitation and would come back again in a heart beat!"

The unit was spotless, and well stocked. Located in a great location. It felt very safe there. We went to the local breweries, and Smack Shack restaurant which are about a 10 minute walk if you cut thru the courtyards. There is also a little market close by. There was plenty of parking in their lot. The only drawback that some might not like is that you have to go up two flights of stairs to get to the unit. We didn't mind it, but some might. Alexandra had the BEST instructions to get into the unit we have ever seen. You couldn't really mess it up, if you tried! The keyless entry was simple to use also. We will definately stay here again if we are in the area."

Stayed one night","This place was perfect for a 1 night stay in Minneapolis. It is in a perfect location right off of Nicollet/eat street with walking distance to multiple places to eat and shop. We also could walk downtown, over to the sculpture garden, and did a run to Uptoen and Lake of the Isles. The space was small but perfect with a full kitchen, large bathroom and we appreciated the a/c unit and easy off street parking."

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at Colin’s did not disappoint! Colin’s instructions were very clear on getting to his home and getting inside. Once inside, it was just as expected…and so much more!!! My daughter and I are thrifters and there were so many fun additions to the place. We felt right at home. We realized on our first morning we forgot toothpaste and Colin was more than happy to come to our rescue! He was very responsive anytime we reached out. We ran into him one time and had a great visit about the neighborhood and it’s history…he’s very kind and passionate about his home and getting it completely up and renovated! We spent a day walking the neighborhood enjoying Spyhouse Coffee (every a.m. actually), Glam Doll Donuts, and thrifting. We felt safe the entire time. The bed and linens are comfy, the kitchen met our needs, the closet space was perfect, we enjoyed a movie each night. Again, Colin’s place did not disappoint!!!"

Stayed one night","It’s a quirky place. The house is under renovation and I get the impression the owner will always have “projects” ongoing there. The property is fun and creative but in various states of repair. Very cool and even has a sense of humor with fun art. Lots of salvage and piecemeal construction that is neat but not pristine as some people might prefer.
The neighborhood is hit and miss. Some areas felt a little sketchy and some were more, I guess, gentrified. Take it as you will. I enjoyed the variety but my mom, for example, would not have liked the area.
It’s very cool but probably not for everyone."

Stayed with kids","Colin’s place is a great spot. The house has solid bones. They don’t build them like this anymore. Colin has done a great job on restoring and we loved the native prairie habitat. There were so many birds and even an albino squirrel!
The room was cozy and just right for two people. The bathroom is huge and Colin has thought about all the things you might need in a kitchen even down to cinnamon for coffee if you want.
My kid and I felt totally safe and we walked quite a few places and explored the neighborhood architecture. If you’re into old houses and lots of native plants, this neighborhood is the place. Walking distance to MIA (museum), great coffee and food."

The ""Foxhole"" is a quiet respite from busy Nicollet (Eat Street) in the Whittier neighborhood, full of diversity and a myriad of restaurant choices. We enjoyed after dinner walks through the Minneapolis College of Art and Design, just a block and a half from the rental. Check out Prodigal Public House(half a block) and hang out with the locals.
Colin's place was a great home base for our adventures in the Twin Cities."

Would have maybe liked to block out a little more light at night but hey / thats why I travel with an eye mask. His recommendations for local spots was great and there were very nice touches within the unit. I struggled to figure out the tv but ultimately just read a book instead.
I’m sure if I had asked he would have responded right away as he was very helpful!
I did get a bit bothered by having three different codes to input coming in/out of the space. Kept having to dig out my phone to remember them all, but it did make me feel safe."

Stayed one night","I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Colin's beautiful home. The location is absolutely amazing. For someone who doesn't currently own a vehicle, the amount of activities within walking distance was amazing. There are countless restaurants, stores and shops. One of my favorite places that is within a five minute walk from Colin's, is the Minneapolis Institute of Art. I couldn't believe how close I was to that beautiful museum. Currently on display now is Caravaggio's Judith and Holofernes. I highly recommend going to see the work of a true classical master.
Besides the location, the home was spectacular. Everything was very clean, I immediately felt comfortable upon arrival, and all my needs were taken care of. There is filtered water in the fridge and coffee available as well.
I can't express how lovely the home was itself. I'm a sucker for hardwood floors, good art, and a clawfoot bathtub. Colin's home has all of these. I can say without a doubt I will be back."

As a former professional cook, I especially appreciated the thought that went into flow and economy of space. There is a proper hood over the stove and lots of cookware and utensils. The claw foot tub with the skylight overhead is one of my favorite features here, next to the big butcher block counter. The bed is really comfortable and I appreciated all the attention to detail: it is a curation. The multiple locks to get in were easy once I figured out how they work and I felt safe and comfortable here the whole time. There was plenty of heat, clean walks leading up to the place, and if you are into history, be sure to read about the building's past on the note on the fridge, and the 17+ years of renovation underway. This place feels good; you can tell when places are tended to with care and that is something that came through here."

The kitchen is extremely well stocked and they had a little coffee nook. The towels and linens were plush and the bed very comfortable. The place was spotless and surprisingly roomy. However, I do not know how comfortable it would be for four or more people. The sun streaming into the dining area each morning was a wonderful way to begin each day. Do not hesitate with this one."

Everything was spotlessly clean, and the light in the apartment was wonderful. The bed was very comfortable and the black-out curtains were much appreciated. The best room in the apartment is the kitchen/dining room. Watching the sunrise through those windows while drinking coffee was the perfect way to start my vacation. The neighborhood was very cute and the apartment is conveniently located by multiple bus stops, a station for the blue line, and The Chatterbox, which was one of our favorite spots for drinks, food, and boardgames. I 100% recommend this spot, and am looking forward to returning the next chance I get."

Location was great, parking was easy, we happened to go on a 100 degree weekend and the apartment was plenty cool. I would definitely recommend this apartment and plan to stay here again when I visit in the future!"

Bright sunny kitchen for morning coffee as well as comfortable furniture to wind down in at night. The mattress was very comfortable and the bathroom had everything you need. If you're lucky enough to find this unit available, snatch it up, you won't be sorry."

They were able to accommodate my early check in request and were very responsive to any questions I had. The area was very close to multiple bus routes and only a 15 min walk to the light rail station. I would definitely recommend this place to future travelers!"

The place itself was quite spacious, despite being only a one-bedroom. We were both able to work our remote jobs comfortably. The kitchen and bathroom were also well-stocked. Can't say enough good things about the neighborhood. We would happily return next time we pass through the city."

The entire space/amenities were well thought out and great stay for the conference we were in town for. Centrally located and a short Uber ride to downtown/local attractions. The only downfall was that we arrived early and while Nina and Caleb attempted to accommodate us they charge a $25 fee to store bags early. Didn’t love that but it’s their business so Just plan your flight accordingly. Otherwise great communicative, thoughtful and available hosts. Would definitely recommend if you’re in town."

Everything was clean and really thoughtfully provided.
Nina and Caleb were really communicative and friendly, the checking in and out instructions were clear and simple.
The apartment also has some easy access to rental bikes, which we used to zip all around town. That made not having a car on our trip much more doable, so we were really happy with the location for that.

The wooden floors, while rustic, were on the noisy side and made it impossible to move around the apartment quietly (for us noise-sensitive folks) and also didnt insulate very well against sounds coming from the first/main floor."

It’s a good location, just a quick drive to Eat Street in Minneapolis. Northbound Smokehouse, Sift Gluten Free Bakery, Sisters’ Slugde Coffee Cafe, Hola Arepa, Rincon 38, Victor’s 1959 Cafe & Baker’s Wife Pastry Shop were my choices during my stay, all locally owned small businesses with quality offerings. I would definitely stay here again when I need another staycation."

Stayed a few nights","For me, an out-of-state visitor of Minneapolis, this was a great place to stay. It was 15 minutes from the airport, and just a short drive from different restaurants and grocery stores. This Air B&B is the second floor of the host's house. There is a separate entrance at the front that opens to a stairway and leads you up to it. The hosts were great about keeping us informed about things like check-in/ out and where to park on days that the street was scheduled to be snow-plowed, but they didn't bother us, which I appreciated. (There is only street parking.) I enjoyed the drink station that was stocked with coffee, tea, and hot chocolate; there was even popcorn and oatmeal in the kitchen for us. A gorgeous house, great location, overall a great place to stay."

The bed was the most comfortable memory foam mattress with nicely weighted blankets and linens. I stayed one night so didn't use the kitchen but it was well appointed. Sandy offered a delicious cup of fresh brewed coffee and was gracioys to let me relax in the living room while she started her day. I highly recommend Sandy's N E. Charmer. I Wish I was back in that cozy bed right now.

I needed to work from home a few days and I was well situated with a nice home office and accoutrements. Kitchen, bathrooms, and laundry room are fully stocked. A special bonus is getting to meet Sandy’s dog (Taco) and cat (Roadie). Taco and Roadie are the best. They mostly hung out in the kitchen, were very well behaved, and were always up for a few pets. A very warm and welcoming home with everything you need for a pleasant stay. I also didn’t have a car with me in January, but found the location within short walking distance to everything I needed: cub, target, Home Depot, restaurants, shops, gyms, etc. Would highly recommend!"

It reminded me of what AirBNB used to be when it first began: people welcoming you into their homes, not someone buying investment properties and doing the bare minimum. I truly felt like a guest.
Usually, even when I leave a glowing review I'll give the host a couple nitpicks privately on how it could be even better...but no need to do that this time! One of my best stays ever."

Sandy’s check-in details made it so easy to find her place and get in, and was very much appreciated! The location is awesome - right down the street from a shopping complex and easy access to major roads! The private bathroom right outside the bedroom was also a plus!
There is a long staircase to get up to the second level and the room, so that may be something to keep in mind if you have mobility issues. The only critique, and very minor at that, is that I wish there had been liquid hand soap in the bathroom rather than a used bar of soap to wash your hands.
Overall, a great value and really nice place to stay!"

It was great working in Sandy’s kitchen as she had everything you might need or imagine you would need! She also was generous in sharing some local fresh produce that was dropped off! Her Clawfoot tub was to die for! ( we took every opportunity to use it as it was wonderful!) since we were so busy we were not able to take advantage of just hanging out in her gazebo with a glass of wine ( which I had imagined!) or enjoy her beautiful home full of amazing collections of glass or art! Being that we are climate activists, we were thrilled to be able to recycle and compost at Sandy’s! It also would have been fun to just get to know Sandy and Taco ( and Roadie her cat!) as she has had a variety of eclectic experiences. We would highly recommend staying at Sandy’s house as you will be well taken care of!"

The location is in a residential area of NE Minneapolis (our favorite area) and there are plenty of great restaurants, breweries & coffee shops nearby. We did not get to meet Sandy but we did meet her cat, Roadie, who was the sweetest! Check-in was super easy, very clear instructions and Sandy's place was cute and quaint. I'd love to stay again sometime!"

She also has a couple of fur babies that were very adorable and available for pets frequently. The neighborhood is lovely and me and my wife are actually going to be moving to Minneapolis next spring, and it was in a large part due to our visit to her home and area. It is also very walkable to local restaurants and shops, but everything is pretty close together in this area of Minneapolis anyway."

Stayed a few nights","Generally I try to find stand-alone places to stay - i.e. my own little studio or apartment, but this was so nice and it was very comfortable and pleasant. I felt right at home. Sandy was great - there as much (or as little) as one might need. I love NE Minneapolis, and there were plenty of excellent restaurants and cafes. The river is within easy walking distance - and getting to/from airport via public transportation is easy and fast. Taco the Dog is a definite plus - absolutely a snuggler and very well behaved. The neighborhood is full of beautifully restored homes which makes for pleasant evening walks - and the nearby park is also a big plus. Definitely a great place to get a feel for what it is like to live in Minneapolis. Sandy is a great host and her home is comfortable, quiet and just very relaxing. Especially loved sitting in the gazebo and just listening to the neighborhood sounds of kids playing, softball games in the park, and people out strolling."

You don't need to take a key with you for the same reason. There is a bus stop within a 3 min walk that takes you downtown and you can go anywhere from there. A supermarket, Cub, is also in the same direction. I'd like to stay at Sandy's place in the future trip to Minneapolis."

The rooms were cleaner than my own at home. Easy parking and popular restaurants all around. 5 stars :D"

Stayed one night","Sandy was so accommodating. Even while our plans were shifting on check-in day, she was responsive, patient, and flexible. She saw us coming up the driveway and welcomed us in immediately to show us around and give us a rundown of the house rules. It would have been okay even if she wasn't there because of the thoroughly helpful and detailed written instructions shared beforehand.
I should also mention that Sandy's home is beautiful!! The layout of the home is quite unique, as you will see on your way to your bedroom through the second floor loft. The decorations and colorful paint job (and plants everywhere!) create an atmosphere of freshness and charm. The house was also very clean! Commendable with two pets around! (Who, I should add, are ADORABLE and welcomed us as well.)
Oh, and Sandy was kind enough to give us access to the tea cabinet :)
Thank you Sandy for hosting us and everything you did to make us feel welcome during our short stay!"

If you need to stay near downtown Minneapolis (or even St. Paul) but are turned off by othe higher staying costs or a more challenging commute, this is a great location. It is indeed a 'Northeast charmer' at a good staying price and an warm, cozy vibe."

We were here on one of the coldest months but glad we had so much close to us in a matter of short walk. Her home is less than 10 min to downtown by Car(uber/lyft) or 45+ min walk.
The home was clean. The room we had was upperstairs a bit steep and carpet if you are clumsy. The guest bathroom was right next to our bedroom door. The bathroom was adorable and everything almost left to its historical appearance. The is an older bathtub that is really tall it was hard to get out (i am 5'1) and my finañce is 6ft and agreed. So keep that in mind if you have mobility problems. Besides that no issues and Host is a great communicator."

So much to do in NE Minneapolis near her place, too. Easy to come and go as we pleased, and I even had room to workout in the office/tv area adjacent to the bedrooms upstairs. Sandy was super friendly, and her doggie Taco and kitty Roadie were cute bonuses!!"

She does have pets (dog and cat), and you'll notice them. For me that's only a plus! Give the cat some extra love, he's very sweet and a little jealous of the how much attention the puppy gets :)"

It's about the size of a hotel room but less expensive than booking a hotel downtown. I loved the vintage details and it smelled good. The only thing I wish it had was a full length mirror - since we went out for the evening it would have made getting ready easier.

I felt safe because of the area and also because there’s more units in it so there’s more people around.
I didn’t feel safe walking outside at nights but it’s my personal impression. Of course for people who have cars is easier.
There’s a huge target a few blocks up where you can buy anything and there’s some restaurants and bars not that far.
The host is super friendly and responds really quick. Internet works perfect ❤️"

I would say the stay rivaled that of a hotel, just without traditional room service. The location can be a little noisy just because the building is a bit older and the walls are a bit thinner, but it was never 'loud', you could just hear everything in the background. Overall, I will definitely be staying here again if I need to be in the area!"

If you’re looking for a place to yourself with a clean bathroom and kitchen - this is your place. It’s very cozy!
Michael (the host) was also very kind and friendly! The self check-in was very easy.
Also, recommend paying for parking if you need it!"

Yes you may hear other guests above you, but very faintly and everyone was respectful of the quite hours. Every now and then you may hear noises from the busy street but it didn’t become annoying at all. 10/10 would stay again!"

The bathroom had stains, the bed wasn’t the most comfy, the hallway way too small, the place smaller than expected but above all, there was MICE! I immediately took videos, packed my things and left, and Michael had the audacity to decline a refund lol, thank God I still got my money back, i had booked for longer but had to cut my stay short because apart from the MICE, a lot wasn’t just right. oh also, the shower head was leaking and spraying water all over my hair wetting it all the time."

The walls are a little thin, however; even though my Airbnb neighbors were courteous and generally quiet, I could still hear basically everything going on in the rest of the complex - when someone turned on the shower, used the microwave, opened a door, etc. - so I wouldn't recommend this spot if you are an extra light sleeper!"

Perfect for those on the go and coming home to relax and reset. I will say that my gf is 5 feet tall and it would have been impossible/difficult for her to reach the cups in the kitchen and the hooks on the back of the door. She couldn’t even reach the microwave. I would recommend adding a step stool to this unit for future guest stays. This review is for unit 306."

The cleanliness of the place was top-notch. I felt immediately at ease upon arrival, as the space was spotless and well-maintained. It's clear that the hosts take great pride in providing a clean and welcoming environment.
Speaking of hosts, they were incredibly responsive and genuinely nice. They were readily available to answer any questions I had and were very accommodating throughout my stay. Their warm and welcoming attitude made the experience even more enjoyable.

Stayed a few nights","Disappointing. Felt like we must have pulled short straw on the unit we got (#104). The bathroom was not one shown in listing pics, it had a round corner shower with doors that didn't close at the bottom leaving multiple inch gap. Huge clump of long hairs on the shower wall when we entered. Wasn't cleaned well throughout. I ran a tissue along the wall of the bathroom & by the kitchenette, picked up a ton of grime. Michael msg'd when we checked in to see how things were & only thing I mentioned was, ""Is it possible to get any more towels?"" 1 tiny towel per person to use for 4 nights doesn't really cut it. He didn't reply then or when I asked a day later, never said anything back at all. Oddly there were two mini-fridges. 1 was fine; the 1 under the TV is leaking & smells like mold. Unit 104 is right by the back door of the building which anyone can enter without a code.
Really thought based on reviews & pics we would love this place! Sadly did not live up to expectations."

Venetian blinds worked fine but didn't keep out outside residual light. Room darkening shades or curtains would have made this better. The internet was strong and the large TV was wonderful. Its a fairly noisy location due to some cross-street construction and it sits in the downtown area. Police, fire and ambulace sirens were frequent throughout the day and night. Convenient to sites and restaurants."

I was only slightly disappointed I didn’t have a stove top like the pictures. I should have requested it since I planned on making eggs every morning before my conference. Target is about one block away to grab groceries. It does say some units aren’t the same, so that’s on me for not asking. It isn’t attached to the skywalk like other hotels but it’s very close to everything. They are also really great about respecting your privacy and time to yourself which I greatly appreciated. 10/10 would stay here again for the next conference I come to!"

As others have mentioned, the walls are thin so you do hear other people but I got used to it. As a long term guest, I appreciated that I could arrange room cleanings periodically and Michael communicated well. It is a cool building and overall I had a good experience staying here!"

The host was super responsive when needed and it was quiet and peaceful in the building. The one and only thing I would do differently would be to book parking in advance if you have a car. I forgot to reserve parking before we got there, and by then there were no spots left. We had to park 3 blocks down in a different lot which wasn’t far but I didn’t feel super comfortable not having my car in the lot next to me, and walking to/from the car at night was a little sketch. So book your parking in advance! Overall it was a cute and clean place and suited our needs perfectly."

I stayed 4 nights while attending a conference at a hotel nearby and it was super easy to get to public transit, restaurants, etc. Host was very responsive and accommodating. Loved the historic building. Despite the location near parking lots and downtown businesses, it was very quiet. And I never heard any noise from above or in nearby rooms. Check in and out was a breeze - appreciate that there's no long list of chores to do when leaving. Great bargain for a very nice place!"

The building was very clean & the room was comfortable and clean for 1 person. The location was easy to get around with MTA transportation I would recommend to my friends that's coming to visit Minneapolis. I would like to do a lower floor the 3rd floor was a lot of stairs going up and down multiple times a day. The entrance door and room doors was very much secured I liked that a lot.

Stayed a few nights","Building was rebuilt due to fire that had happened. They did an okay job. Location is pretty cool as it’s a tiny building surrounded in downtown. I think the price is high for the area.
The room didn’t have hangers or and paper towels. There were two towels for two guests and we stayed 4 nights (both guests with long hair) call me spoiled but the sheets felt like a 300thread count.
The room had too much furniture in it and everything is up really high so if you are short grab the step stool. The pictures also make the rooms look larger than they actually are.
The AC started condensation the last day and dripped on the floor. I wouldn’t quite say it’s a 5 star stay more like a 3.7-4.
The host was great as I didn’t interact with him much but with what little I did he was very quick to respond no matter the time of day."

Stayed a few nights","This is a really cool building and the room was great! Location is pretty nice — easily accessible to downtown and very close to Target if you need to pick up a few things. The room is cozy and well-appointed.
Despite all the good stuff, if you need reliable wifi, this is not the right place for you. Wifi was generally reliable throughout the day, maybe dropping 4-5 times throughout the day, but at about 7pm, it became unusable. It was dropping in some cases almost as soon as it would reconnect making even getting a single web page to load an exercise in frustration.
Communicated with the host about it the first night it happened, and they said they would look into it. I never heard back, and when I contacted them the next night because it was happening again, they never replied.
I had to contact AirBNB for a refund and move to a nearby hotel. That's costing me about 50% more and the whole process was painful, but it's worth it to have relatively reliable internet access."

Stayed a few nights","This place has a lot of charm! It's easy to see the upscale concept they were going for. But due to a bit of neglect, it's getting a bit worn. Furniture stained and/or broken, missing silverware and coffee pot. It's totally central, the room is spacious, the aircon was cool, and the price was fair, so I was okay. With two exceptions: First, the shower hot water was a bare trickle and got cold really fast. They fixed it next day, but that's still 25% of my time in my place that I didn't have a hot shower. Anyone could have seen that it wasn't flowing right, so not sure how it could have been left in that condition for a guest. Second: all of the requests for additional service fees, ratings, etc, all off-Air B&B app- felt really scammy to me. Parking fees, late check-out fees. I didn't need any of that, but I was left with an uncomfortable feeling rather than the delight I get when I'm staying at a great Air B&B. Not sure I would go back - there's probably a better place for me."

Bottled water, snacks and drinks were waiting when I arrived - along with a very sweet welcome note!
Check in was easy and communication was a breeze. I appreciated having my own parking space right behind the house and a private entrance to the Standish Suite. Raevhann checked in during my stay to see if I needed anything, and was attentive but not overwhelming or overbearing. When my work event ended early, she invited me back to the airbnb and offered a late check out so I could nap before heading to the airport; I was so grateful!
It was a wonderful stay and I will definitely stay again- highly recommend !"

The place is really comfortable and pleasant, not dark or gloomy like some basement apartments. It’s very clean and well stocked with pretty much everything you could need. Raevhann was super helpful and friendly, we would definitely stay again!"

She has provided everything you could want in the way of amenities. What I appreciated most was the quality of the workmanship that went into renovating her basement apartment. We've probably all seen do-it-yourselfer AirBnB renovations where things don't quite fit, the light switch pokes into the door frame, whatever. This is NOT that. Everything is thought-through and well-constructed, also well-insulated from the space above. And it comes at a wonderful price point. Would definitely stay again."

Stayed one night","Raevhann and Mitchell's place was great! I ended up staying here two times as bookends on my trip to Minnesota (with a detour up to Duluth in the middle), and they couldn't have been more accommodating. The space was clean, comfortable, and very welcoming. It's a good location within reasonable distances from everything I wanted to see and do when I was visiting the Twin Cities.
I was able to meet Raevhann and Mitchell in-person and they both were so friendly. I highly recommend staying here and would absolutely stay here myself again if my travels ever bring me back to Minneapolis."

Minnesota has soooo many mosquitos in the summer, but we did not notice a single mosquito at this rental. The host thoughtfully provided bug spray, though!
This is a very well-executed Airbnb rental. I hope to stay here again for more than one night!"

It was only a 12 minute drive from Raevhann's place to my daughter's apartment. EVERYTHING in her home was perfect from the ease of checking in to the comfortable furniture (especially the cozy bed and super soft linens) to the comfy couch and super clean bathroom. She left helpful notes throughout the home and was VERY responsive each time i messaged her. Thank you for a lovely stay Raevhann! We hope your place is available next year when my daughter graduates!

Stayed one night","I can not say enough about Raevhann or her beautiful space! The pictures were perfectly accurate, yet they don't do the space justice. The details were amazing. The care and thought that went into the design. I could have just stayed there and never ventured outside, although it's close to many things to do and eat, as well as to the airport. Her place felt like home. The snacks and treats upon arrival with the handwritten note made us really feel appreciated. The prompt and proactive communication made us feel so welcome in their space. PLENTY of space for 2 people...or 4. I also love that she, politely, set clear boundaries for living in the space. As a mom and teacher, I understand it! I would without hesitation recommend (and stay again at) Raevhann's cute blue house. I mean they even shoveled out a path for us to park in the back and it was a LOT of snow! Kind, considerate, thoughtful. Thank you!"

The big couch was so comfortable and Raevhann had small snacks, water, and coffee/tea ready for us when we arrived. Despite the cold temperatures, the space was so warm and cozy. It made it hard to leave because we just wanted to watch movies and be lazy! It’s in a residential location so you’re not in the hustle/bustle of the city, but a close enough 20 minute drive to uptown and all the good food spots. I would definitely recommend!"

It's absolutely spotless, the location couldn't be better, it's private, quite, great neighborhood. Everything you want in an AirBNB stay. They had coffee pods and snacks and they are just so friendly, reaching out to see if we needed anything and even offering a later checkout if needed. I've never been to a nicer/friendlier AirBNB. A couple great things about this stay, there was creamer waiting in the fridge for us (which they offered last time and got us hooked on, it's so good) and when we mentioned to them that it was going to be us and my mom coming for a play in Minneapolis, they set and made up an air mattress for us! They truly go above and beyond and their space is just so comfortable and the perfect spot for trips to the cities!"

They have answered all our questions we had about Minnesota. From asking what the weather is like, to places to visit and food to try out. Please do yourself a favor and go to Blue Door Pub, their Juicy Lucy burger is to die for! This is the ideal spot to stay at! They have a welcoming living room, spacious bathroom, and great bedroom. Plenty of blankets to keep you nice and toasty through out the cold nights. But most importantly, there are in the middle of everything. You are about 12 minutes from the Mall of America, 15 minutes from the US Bank stadium and 12 minutes from the airport. Raevhann and Mitchell’s house was absolutely convenient. Their neighborhood is adorable, wonderful for early or late night walks. We will cherish our first time to Minnesota, and it is all thanks to Raevhann and Mitchell for taking care of us. Book NOW!"

The Airbnb is in the basement but the hosts did a great job remodeling their basement to host guests. We were greeted with a message and some snacks which was a nice touch. The living room was so well laid out and there were lots of streaming options on the tv. The bed was incredibly comfy.
Check-in/check-out: incredibly smooth and easy. The hosts were very accommodating with the check-out time as well.
Location: it takes about 15 min to drive anywhere within Minneapolis. The neighborhood didn’t seem super safe. You had to drive through some rough areas to arrive at the place. But the street the Airbnb was at seemed ok. I just would not walk outside at night by myself."

Stayed one night","If I could give more than 5 stars I would . I travel and stay in hotels and Air BnB's a lot . This has been the best all rounder for me ...
It's a $10 Lyft from the airport so quick after a long flight , it was immaculately clean ,it had home from home amenities but a bedroom with a hotel feel !
From booking to leaving these guys are super helpful ,friendly and very hospitable. My flight was rescheduled and they instantly refunded my date change , met me upon arrival and took time for a chat . Showed me how the TV set up and was just at the end of a text if I needed anything . I was able to pop my washing in whilst watching Netflix and enjoy some of the snacks left out on a cute tray , take a shower with great water pressure and nice and hot . Then get into the comfiest bed with fab linens .
I can't recommend this place enough and if I'm in town again Im hoping they'll have me back ."

Mette was welcoming and extremely responsive and, as a bonus, you can look through the cookbooks in the incredible kitchen that feature her work as a very talented photographer.
Our visit with nearby family was made even more special by staying at the Nordic Guesthouse, and Mette's welcoming spirit was a big part of that! I can pretty much guarantee that staying here will surpass most any other AirBnB experience."

We loved working from the beautiful kitchen island with the warm sun streaming in, making home-cooked meals in the incredible (and extremely well-stocked!) kitchen, and cuddling up to read in the living room and upstairs in the bedroom loft area in the evenings. The Nordic Guesthouse was pristine, and Mette was a wonderfully kind, considerate and friendly host. We wish we could live here full-time! We will absolutely recommend Mette's place to any and all friends and family looking for a place to stay in Minneapolis."

It is a beautiful oasis in the middle of a lovely neighborhood in Minneapolis - full of charm & community. Mette has put so much love and attention into this cozy space. The kitchen is breathtaking - filled with everything you could possibly need to feel at home. The sliding doors to the outside bring the beautiful flower garden into your space to make you feel like you are in your own private garden of color. All of the furnishings are top of the line and environmentally friendly. It even smells so good - so clean - without any particular fragrance, which is unique. We felt so at home. We lived in the Twin Cities in the 80’s and 90’s and this made our homecoming even more special. If you have any inclination to visit Minneapolis, stay in this guesthouse. You will be so glad you did. Thank you Mette for the privilege of staying in your home."

A newer build in an older neighborhood. This means great electrical outlet access, non-sloping floors, energy efficiency and great light. Close to the river for quiet walks and near the freeway for easy access.
Mette has outfitted the kitchen excellently! This makes it easy & fun to have guests in OR just cooking a meal for yourself.

Stayed about a week","This guesthouse is STUNNING! The kitchen is beautiful and fully stocked. I came from out of state to visit my home state and stayed for a week. The entire house was impressively well stocked with everything that could possibly be needed during my stay. There is one bed in the loft large enough for two people, as well as 2 extremely comfortable cots with what seemed to be memory foam mattresses downstairs. (One evening, I used one of them, as I had a family member in town to see me) There is a parking spot available right next to the house, and parking is very easy to find on the street. Plenty of space in the closet upstairs for long term stays, as well. There is a gorgeous deck right outside the kitchen that is perfect for spending time outside. I would be very happy to stay in this guesthouse again, whether it be for a short stay, or a long stay. Mette is very responsive, check in and out was very easy (I was actually told I could check in early, so I didn't need to kill time after my flight landed before checking in) and there is a very helpful book provided with pertinent information. This was my first airbnb experience, and I think it will be hard for other airbnbs to live up to this one in my future travels to other cities. I can't recommend this house enough!"

Stayed about a week","The best Airbnb I have stayed at so far. Inspired and clean design, wonderful kitchen, tons of windows for great cross breezes, set in a sumptuous garden tended to by Mette, master gardener and trailblazer. Great lighting, generously stocked with everything you need. Lovely outdoor patio with picnic table, comfortable chairs, and large umbrella for shade nestled in the garden. Double set of sliding glass doors in kitchen let in light and the garden as if it's part of the house but great shades let you control your privacy when wanted. Nice carport shelters in case of rain and so convenient right next to the entrance to the house. It's a house you feel good living in. Comfortable bed, great closet and drawer space. Roomy bathroom. All good! Best of all is your host, Mette who brought this little paradise to life with her vision."

The space itself is light, new and beautiful, a place where you are happy to hang out. With the radiant heat floors it is welcoming the moment you enter. Everything has been carefully planned for your comfort, including having a deep stash of towels and supplies so that you never need to worry about running out. The instructions for running the appliances are right there. I wish my own house was this well organized. Mette has the art of hospitality down to a science, but you will also relish also the thoughtful touches -- like the two black-and-white checked umbrellas that seem to match the decor. You feel you are being treated like royalty, and that Mette is more of a hostess than a landlord. She really cares, and all I can say is that I hope guests continue to treat her as well as she treats them."

It is immaculate, light, serene and inviting, The host has stocked it with everything, including half and half for the coffee, Minnesota wine (who knew?), and any kitchen tool you might need to whip up a dinner plus a wonderfully deep stash of towels. The shower is just divine! We felt we were truly being treated as guests. That radiant floor heating is such a touch of luxury, too, welcoming you in from the Minnesota winter. If I have a complaint it's that the Nordic guest house is so warm and charming that I did not venture out as much as I probably should have (the Seward neighborhood around it is walkable and fun, and very close to a wonderful walk along the river). I was expecting functionality, but the place offers well-thought-out craftsmanship and design. None of us realizes how much pure beauty can influence our moods, until we experience beauty like this. I cannot recommend the Nordic guest house highly enough, and do hope to return for more visits."

Stayed a few nights","Mette's house looks great online, but in person it's even more lovely. The house manages to be both beautiful and very functional. Everything is in its place, and the space is gorgeous, but it doesn't feel precious at all. The kitchen is extremely well-equipped, with expansive windows onto the garden. The layout of the house is perfect, with lots of windows, beautiful wood finishes, and polished concrete floors in the kitchen and bathroom. The location is great: Short walking distance to a great food co-op, a nice park, and a few cute cafes, and walking distance to the west side of the U of M campus. The neighborhood is quaint and nice to walk around as well.
Mette is a delightful, generous host who is immediately responsive to any request. The house was equipped with all sorts of goodies in the refrigerator, and the bathroom was well-stocked for any emergency. In short, she has thought of everything to ensure you are well taken care and have a lovely time!

I live in the Lowry Hill East part of Minneapolis and took a mini staycation at Mette's guesthouse. She was warm and responsive right from the start—a great example of what a host should be. The kitchen is very spacious and generously stocked with all the little extras you tend to forget when traveling including fresh items in the refrigerator. I spent a lot of time in the kitchen and used the large table as a work desk. The view from the kitchen table into the yard is beautiful. The bathroom is VERY clean and stocked well too. You can tell she's thought a lot about her traveler's needs and adds personal touches to her space that will make you feel cared about. Oh! And there are a lot of really great books. Lots!
This is a great location. It's a short walk to any public transportation you need, or a cafe, grocery store, bar, bowling alley, Mississippi River (for those who run or bike), or a park. I loved this space and would recommend it to anyone, even those already here in Minneapolis who just need a little staycation. Thanks, Mette! Would love to come back again."

Stayed about a week","So read all the reviews and multiple the fabulousness by 10! I travel ALOT for work, and normally stay downtown in a hotel; but, this time I wanted to stay somewhere that would enable me to really relax and have options, especially with this extended trip. And I found it! I was able to cook all my meals with the aid of this amazing kitchen, utensils and fully stocked cabinets. Additionally having the ability to wash my clothes during my 9 day stay made my trip even more comfortable. Mette was absolutely accessible, friendly and flexible. This by far was the best work trip I’ve had and it’s all due to this Airbnb. Not to mention this guesthouse is gorgeous! All the details and clean lines, blew me away. I’ll be staying here as much as possible for all my Minneapolis trips!"

Stayed with kids","When I was reading through all of the great reviews for this place, I thought, “Seems overhyped. I’m probably going to be disappointed.” Let me tell you, I was NOT disappointed!! The house is gorgeous—well-designed, full of light, beautifully finished, with everything you need for a perfect stay. From the heated floors to the chef’s kitchen to the endless sources of natural light, this place is the very definition of sanctuary. And Mette is what every Airbnb host should aspire to be—thoughtful, knowledgeable, and an excellent communicator. Any time I had a question, she had a response within minutes. Definitely check with her before you pack, because you won’t need to bring much of anything! The kitchen has enough staples to make a week’s worth of meals, and the bathroom is stocked with virtually everything a guest might need. As a family with young kids, we especially appreciated the in-home laundry. It’s always nice to go home with a suitcase full of clean clothes! We also enjoyed her library of books. In sum, it was a perfect stay that completely lived up to the hype. We will be staying here every time we come to Minneapolis from now on!
PS—Special thanks to Mette for letting our children do an Easter egg hunt in her back yard. :)"

Stayed a few nights","The Nordic Guesthouse is a well-appointed, comfortable (fantastisk hyggeligt), strikingly beautiful home away from home. Mette herself is a remarkable woman, accomplished artist, community advocate, and global citizen who genuinely cares for the well-being of her guests. Our little family felt respected, welcomed, and wonderfully cared for every minute of our stay. Staying here was a gift."

Stayed a few nights","Wow wow wow! We had very high expectations going to say at the Nordic guesthouse based on the pics and description and they were beyond exceeded! I’m rather OCD when it comes to cleanliness and let me say, it was so clean it was as though no one had ever stayed there before yet still had a homey warm feel. Everything was very easy to find, laid out purposefully and she had more amenities than any other Airbnb I’ve stayed at. It’s beyond BEAUTIFUL. And with the heated floors, full size chef’s kitchen, and high ceilings you feel like you’re in a small million dollar mansion. And Mette was the nicest host we’ve ever had. We will be back to Minneapolis just to stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","We come to Minneapolis often and typically stay in downtown hotels, however this time we figured we’d try something different. We could not have asked for a better place to stay. Everything from first contacting Mette to checking out was a great experience.
Mette’s place is a dream come true. We really enjoyed the Scandinavian minimalism, but also how extremely cozy and warm the space was. There were many thoughtful touches throughout the place and it all came together so well. While we don’t really cook we appreciated the well stocked kitchen, and how much there was at our disposal if needed.
Unfortunately our stay was during two back to back snow storms, and we didn’t check out the area too much. But we did visit the local co-op which was one of the best we’ve been to. We also took Lyft downtown instead of driving and the fairs were incredibly reasonable.
Mette was also very kind and introduced herself when we arrived and made herself available to any questions we had during our stay. Prior to booking and checking in she answered all our questions and was very flexible with a couple things that came up on our end.
We had an amazing time and can’t say enough great things about our stay, and we certainly hope to stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","Mette's place is a work of art! I booked it for my dad who was visiting me in Seward and he loved it! Her attention to detail is incredible - you can find anything you could possibly need. We especially enjoyed reading her manual where she shares about her vision for the space and ways she is connected to the neighborhood.
Mette was also very kind, perfectly outgoing without being overbearing, and accommodating. I'm grateful I not only found a great place for my family to stay in the future, but also met a wonderful, inspiring neighbor!"

Stayed a few nights","I can not say enough about Mette's hospitality and how special the guesthouse is. From the perfect building design to the carefully planned details, to the superb kitchen to the fully stocked pantry, a stay at the Nordic guesthouse is truly a treat. I loved so many things: seeing the moon from the bedroom window, the peaceful garden, the sunlight coming into the kitchen.
Thank you Mette for sharing with others such a beautiful and peaceful place."

Mette is an exceptional host being readily available for questions or recommendations while also being very sensitive to our privacy. She is delightful to talk to and a tremendous resource for restaurant recommendations as well as other insights about the neighborhood and Minneapolis as a whole. We will definitely return!"

The guest house is in a central location in the city, and has many walkable food options.
As others have mentioned, Mette is a fantastic host and made sure we had everything we needed."

Stayed about a week","We stayed at Mette's place for a week while recovering from minor knee surgery and had a restful stay. The unit is essentially a complete home with the perfect amount of utility and comfort.
If you like to cook you'll get the most out of your stay. A full kitchen plus access to Mette's garden of vegetables and herbs made our week cheap and delicious.
If you prefer to venture out for food and drinks, Seward has a multicultural neighbourhood and welcoming community with many excellent coffee shops and restaurants (we snuck out a few times).
Mette was a gracious and helpful host and gave us a quick tour of the home and garden when we arrived. We enjoyed our stay and recommend Mette's place to anyone who wants a comfortable base to explore the Twin Cities."

Stayed a few nights",I don't even know where to begin. Mette's guesthouse is absolute heaven and exactly as described. As someone who appreciates good design and is very visual I couldn't have asked for anything more. The guesthouse has a fully stocked dream kitchen and family meals were a highlight of my visit. Not to mention fresh produce from Mette's garden which is a gem in and of itself. This was truly was best air bnb experience to date. Mette is an incredible host and made me feel right at home! Highly recommended!

Stayed a few nights","The place looks good and is even better than it looks! Additionally, we couldn't have asked for a better host. Mette has thought of everything that might possibly be needed and has made them available. Provisions were made available in the form of snacks, drinks, and a fully stocked pantry; even fresh vegetables from the garden!
Mette's place is centrally located just a short distance from U of M and downtown Minneapolis. It seemed everywhere we wanted to go was only a few mins drive away. There are a variety of restaurants in walking distance and there's a grocery and pharmacy nearby."

Stayed a few nights","Quite simply the best AirBnB property we've stayed at. This lovely guest house, newly built in a modern Nordic style, was extremely comfortable for our 4-day stay. Mette was a marvelous, gracious host who stocked the home with anything we could have possibly needed. The Seward neighborhood is terrific with great neighborhood restaurants and convenient to downtown Minneapolis and the interstate. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again in the future provided I can get in. Pretty sure this will be a highly sought after destination."

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I have travelled the world, staying at places posted on AirBnB's competitor's sites. This was our first AirBnB experience and what a fantastic one it was! This is a new construction and we were only the second ones to rent it out. We get the feeling that it's going to be quite popular as word gets around.
Where to start? Before we arrived, Mette was in constant contact trying to find out if we need anything. She gave us extra directions, just in case. When we arrived, she was in her backyard waiting. We walked in to find such a beautiful and welcoming space. She had already stocked the refrigerator with the essentials: water, wine, beer, eggs, bread, half-n-half, etc. Refreshments were ready and we had what we needed for the next morning's breakfast. We've only had that once before and that was at a small flat in Paris. Such hospitality! Please try this place out - I'm sure you will be as happy as we were!"

Stayed a few nights","I've stayed in a lot of great AirBnBs... Mette's place was the best by far. It is exactly as described: a cute-as-a-button hideaway in the quiet Seward neighborhood. If anything, the photos don't do it justice. It is a beautiful example of clean, functional Danish design. It was immaculate, comfortable, cozy... Just perfect. The location is great. A easy jaunt to the U of M or downtown Minneapolis. As a host, Mette couldn't be more welcoming and lovely. She left me a little welcome basket, and stocked the fridge with some basic provisions, which I've never had happen at an AirBnB before. If I could give six stars, I would. I can't wait to stay here again!"
