Stayed with kids","We enjoyed our stay here. This may not mean much to anyone else, but one thing I really appreciated was the blankets. They had so many plush blankets in the linen closet, folded neatly, and they were freshly washed. My kids didn'tbring their blankets and that made our stay so much more comfortable. You could tell the quilts on the beds had been washed, too. That is a big deal to me. Everything was labeled and organized. Like other reviews stated, we had a plate of fresh cookies when we arrived. That was a very nice touch. The only thing is, I didn't realize this was basically a guest house. it is on the property, at the end of the driveway of a larger house. We still had privacy and enjoyedour stay, but It made it a little confusing to find in the dark."

Stayed a few nights","We were up there to pre-fish for a tournament and wanted to stay on the lake,but it was overpriced/booked. Found this place and thought it might be too far from the lake, but it is an easy 12 min drive to Lincoln Landing. The house has a carport that will fit 2 boats with power poles under it which was nice since it was raining while we were there. When we entered the house the host had left us some homemade chocolate chip cookies, which were delicious. We left for dinner and when we returned the power was out, but the host left us a battery powered lantern and a note saying Alabama power will have it back on by 9. The place is clean and great, The host is great, we will definitely be back next time we are up here fishing."

Stayed a few nights","This could not have been a better stay. Victoria and Tom are fabulous, attentive hosts. Their home is much larger than the photos show, and much more beautiful than the photos show. Their sunflower theme is charming. Perfect kitchen to cook. Quiet and peaceful neighborhood with families. Safe and secure. Short distance between the parking and the entry door, so luggage and my “traveling library for work” were easy to manage. They are smart to provide a local channel in addition to streaming services, as a traveler needs to know the status of local weather, at times. They provided games, cards, books, welcome snacks, coffee, tea, and more. I highly recommend! Thanks, Tom and Victoria! Our staff will be back to work hard and rest well again. You’re fabulous hosts!"

Stayed about a week","If you have to stay in Talladega, this is the place to do so. The cottage is spacious and has everything you need. The hosts were very nice and just a text away if we needed anything. It is a suburban house in South East USA so you should expect to perhaps encounter some insect visitors, but the house was very well cleaned and we felt comfortable."

Plenty of space for us to relax before our backpacking trek. Wish we had been able to stay longer to enjoy all the amenities. Victoria and Tom were very responsive and access was very easy. I will hope to stay again when I return for some more backpacking in the future"

I reserved Natalie’s Place and messaged Jackie at 6am hoping we could enter the home at 8am. She immediately responded and told us to help ourselves to breakfast food in the frig. The next day Jackie & John showed up delivered one of her homemade pound cakes and mowed the lawn. The home is decorated beautifully, the accommodations and décor helped us to relax. The home is stocked with amenities which added to our comfort. The children enjoyed playing in the huge backyard. There's plenty of room for everyone to sit on the front and back porch while taking in the view of the well-manicured lawn. To our surprise someone showed up early the following morning emptied the trash and left additional garbage bags. We are looking forward to staying at Natalie’s Place again in the future. Natalie’s Place is ""Our New Home Away From Home""
Thanks for your hospitality!"

Stayed a few nights",I had 4 kid's which were all under 12 & 2 were 7 month old twins. So it's a $25 fee for extra guest including kid's which I didn't mind paying. I just called to get an understanding & wanted to know if I was paying for infants also. Well we never made it that far because she was instantly rude when I called. I guess she assumed that I called because I didn't want to pay but that was not the case. She did apologize after I let her know I'm not being rude so why are you. But I canceled my reservation to stay because if your rude to me as the customer for no reason I definitely don't want to spend my money with you. Overall house was nice & clean but customer service was horrible.

Stayed a few nights","Everything was fantastic! My new bride and I came straight here after leaving our wedding, wanting a place to slow down and unwind for a bit before getting back into the swing of things. And that's exactly what we found. The house is an older home, but completely updated on the inside, with classy furnishings and a cozy environment. The kitchen was well stocked with the utensils you'd need to cook pretty much anything, and there are even some ingredients already available, including snacks to tide you over until the food is done, haha. The stay was lovely, and the small personal touches, from the flower petals on the floor to the chocolates on the bed, were beyond what we expected. We cannot recommend Miss Jackie and Natalie's Place more."

It was a surprise birthday getaway for my husband who is an avid fisherman. He received an unexpected birthday greeting that put a huge smile on his face and having access to the water, he was in pure heaven (as was I). This is definitely our new home away from and staycation being that we are not far from home, but felt so far away. Can't wait for our next visit. Perfect place! Perfect hosts!! 👌🏾"

When I arrived on Friday there was a muffin and a selection of delicious tea, and I snuggled up in a cozy blanket to watch the sunset on the dock. Can't say enough about my stay, it's clear how much she does to make it a serene and beautiful experience. And, when you check out, the only thing you have to do is your dishes! This stay was my best Mother's Day gift yet."

I chose this location for my boyfriend's birthday getaway and we walked into the kitchen, she had left a bottle of wine and a cake with a ""Happy Birthday"" tag. I thought it was an incredibly sweet gesture!! The instructions were very clear and precise about location, how to check in, and how to operate certain things within the home. It also needs to be noted the amount of time, energy, and the gathering of information it took to make the very impressive book she made with all the local favorites. And the bed....soooo comfy! The view from our bedroom was absolutely beautiful 😍 It was veryyyy cold outside during our stay, so we weren't able to use the outside amenities, but we definitely plan on coming back during the warmer months. Thanks again to Jennifer and her husband for such a beautiful, clean, and peaceful place."

Stayed a few nights","What a great find, driving up to Siestas and Sunsets, we could not believe what a fantastic location we had found. The whole experience that Jennifer has created with the amenities and decor together with thoughtfull touches make this a lovely place to be. Jennifer is a very responsive host and the check in was easy, once settled in we looked through a very useful information folder with lots of recommendations for activities and places to eat. Our only regret is due to our schedule we could only stay for two nights, i would have enjoyed taking one of the kayaks out or even going for a swim. Thank you Jennifer and it was a pleasure chatting with you."

They thought of everything, from yoga mats to outdoor fireplaces, hair dryers, iron, and everything you could need in the kitchen. The place is so cozy and well decorated. And the views are impeccable.
They were very responsive to our questions answering immediately when needed. We hope to come back again ❤️"

Stayed a few nights","This was a small oasis away from the busy day to day! The views of the water are breathtaking, and you can see it while laying in bed. One of our favorite spots was the porch swing on the pier. We’ve never been anywhere so clean and felt so warm and cozy as soon as we stepped inside. Jennifer and Terry were great hosts that were available anytime we needed them. They also thought of everything you could need to have in the space, including cookware, dishes and beach towels. We were also very impressed that they had kayaks we could use on the lake, which was such an added bonus to enjoy. It was hands down my favorite thing to do and wished we would have gone kayaking each day of our stay. They have a gem of a place and we hope to be back again. We can’t thank them enough for a truly unforgettable experience to enjoy the beauty of Alabama!"

Stayed a few nights","Perfect! We have stayed at many AirBnb places and have appreciated the uniqueness of each. But this, this is a spot like heaven on earth. We sat Friday afternoon on the dock until the sun set and then enjoyed morning coffee on the lakeside patio. Watching the birds fly and the fish jump was so relaxing. If we hadn't had planned things to do in the area, our weekend would've been complete hanging outside there. The apartment was lovely with amazing views of that lake. Slept comfortably, the shower was exquisite, and our sweet hosts even provided coffee and muffins. While we didn't get to kayak as planned (we had a packed schedule), Jennifer had everything ready. All in all, wonderful hosts and so grateful they share their home."

We were intrigued when booking because of the amazing reviews as well as the phenomenal photos. It was even better than we expected! So clean, pristine even. Jennifer is so accommodating and even left out fresh muffins for a warm welcome. We thoroughly enjoyed the well-stocked kitchen (pots and pans, utensils, etc.) so that we could enjoy our own cooking. The sunsets are unbelievable and we couldn’t wait to wake up and drink coffee on the porch every morning.
We genuinely hope to be in the area and to stay again."

Having the grill was a great addition to the more limited (but still serviceable) kitchen. The outdoor furniture, kayaks, and fire pit definitely expand your options here.

Stayed a few nights","My best friend and I came for a girls getaway weekend and wanted to be lizards in the sun, and found Sunsets and Siestas.
Jennifer and Terry were absolutely amazing hosts. The space was beautiful - so clean and with a breathtaking view of the lake.
The bed was incredibly comfortable, soft blankets in the living room and bedroom, and the waterfall shower was the best shower I’ve had in a LONG time. There were plenty of dishes, which I always find a plus in Airbnbs.
They had a binder with local recommendations, so we didn’t have to think too hard about where to have dinner!
We texted asking about kayaking and they got PFDs and paddles ready for us quickly! Finally, Terry came and helped up build a perfect fire. It was a great way to end our little getaway weekend.
I can’t wait to come back for a weekend with my boyfriend!
Thank you to Jennifer and Terry for such a great space."

From the moment we drove up, we knew this place was special.
There were Wrens bouncing in the trees & Red Headed Woodpeckers eating. Whether lingering on the porch, sitting in the den or lounging in the bed the view of the lake is spectacular. The apartment is clean, bright and very nicely decorated. Jennifer & Terry invited us into Sunsets & Siestas with many personal touches that made it feel just like home. My husband & I wanted somewhere to rest & that is what we’ve done all while watching & listening to the birds & sounds of lake life. The hosts were a delight to meet.

Jennifer was gracious, kind and thoughtful, and we felt so welcomed with the special touches. It was a great spot to get away for our wedding anniversary. My husband and I both loved it and also really enjoyed kayaking in the afternoon (somehow Jennifer also managed to order up some fantastic weather for us, even in February!) It was close enough we also enjoyed the views and hiking at Mt Cheaha, so we managed to enjoy both mountain and lake for our weekend away. I can see why Jennifer is rated as a Super Host, she really is! We thoroughly enjoyed our time there and would enjoy returning someday."

The apartment has everything you will need and more! They didn't miss one detail when creating this space and it feels very private along with a perfect lake view from every window.
The check in was simple and Jennifer was amazing with communication and accommodation of our stay. Even left us a beautiful card and bottle of wine for us to enjoy on our first family vacation with our newborn.
Fire pit was stocked with wood and only needed a match to start, charcoal grill ready to be lit, and kayak ready to ride along with all vests and oars ready at hand. They even had a yoga mat available for those tranquil morning sunrise stretches that you only see in the movies.
Truly a gem of a stay and we will most certainly be back to enjoy again!!!!"

Thank you to The Getaway for a beautiful cabin that fit all our needs for the 5 days we were there."

Stayed a few nights","The cabin in the woods was an excellent getaway. The large window faced a lovely wooded area and was quite private. However, you are not strictly alone in the woods at this location. There are in fact approximately 30-40 seperate cabins that are seperated by (in our case) only about 150 feet. While the windows were mostly not facing the other cabins, the feeling of the location was more of a nice and secluded homey trailer park, rather than a by-yourself-in-the-woods getaway.
We especially enjoyed the vibey radio/bluetooth speaker and used it extensively.
The kitchen was a bit lacking. No toaster, oven, or freezer, which was a bit unfortunate as it was difficult to cook much.
There is Wifi, which worked wonderfully. And there was also a small book of 150 card games with detailed rulesets! We especially enjoyed playing cards (which were included)
This was not made very clear, but the food items on the bar and the fire supplies are not complimentary, and you will be charged extra."

My travel companion and I stayed two nights, made a fire, cooked a meal, and dedicated time to a healing journey on our road trip retreat through the States. This space served us in all the ways we needed and we loved the little touches that helped us feel at home; like the tea, smores bag, and just how intentionally everything was set up. Highly recommended!"

In person, they are bigger, cleaner, more luxurious and so much more comfortable than we could have imagined. We went on walks every day on the beautiful property and even managed to run when we felt like it, as the roads and pathways are in pristine condition. There are local recommendations, extra items to enhance your stay (from insect repellant to smores kits) and the cabins are kitted out to meet any and all needs! We 100% recommend this stay to everyone!"

It took me by complete surprise as it is in the middle of nowhere Alabama. They have everything you could ever need in this cute little tiny home - even things you didn’t think you needed or wanted! There is no mirror over the sink or on the wall so if that is something you need, make sure to bring one with. This seemed to be an intentional part of the design and experience which I quickly came to love. I appreciated the thoughtfulness surrounding rest and time in nature so much! My only regret is that we didn’t stay longer."

The host was incredibly prepared and had the kitchen fully stocked with everything I could possibly need, including individual oil packets for cooking. The cabin itself was breathtaking, with a giant window next to the bed that provided an amazing view of the sunrise and stars at night. We were nestled on an overlook and saw multiple deer during our stay, which was a great bonus. The location was quiet and secluded, yet still close enough to stores for a small grocery run. I was particularly impressed with the included amenities like wood, firestarter, and a smore kit, which made the trip feel extra special. The cleanliness and attention to detail were exceptional, with everything individually packaged. Overall, I had an amazing experience and would highly recommend this cabin to anyone looking for a peaceful and memorable getaway. We will be back for sure!!"

The night view......omg. and one of those nights the moon was right outside our window. The only issue was the shower head :( it was hard to shower because the shower head is 8 ft high and it was not adjustable. So to my girls that don't want their hair to get wet. Bring a shower cap. So i literally had to shower with the door open to keep my hair from getting wet. Other than that everything else was perfect. I just know next time bring sneakers and shower cap.

Despite some confusion and concerns, we still had a great time during our stay. We loved looking out of the window and enjoying the peaceful view of the riverside.
We are excited to try out other tiny cabin from getaway’s in different states during our next trip."

We loved our stay at our cozy and cleverly designed cabin! Well equipped yet super minimalistic. Everything you need within arms reach. All without skimping on comfort.
Everything else is thought off too - fire pit, smores, hot chocolate, deck of cards - the Getaway experience lets you focus on you and your company and the trees around. Suggested activities and games are great for those restless among us! 😉
The kitchen, though tiny, works great. Bathroom is super clean and great shower head.
The area is pretty - perfect for a long walk or some playtime. You won’t even have to leave the park. Some cool local stores (a great fabric store!), great nature and the pretty river all provide plenty for a small getaway.
Neighboring cabins seem close but you hardly see any through the trees and you won’t hear anything but the trees and the wind. You feel safe yet secluded."

We added like $40 to our tab due to not knowing, the logs said it was included in our stay but charged $8. Oh well, no biggie. Just be aware! Overall we LOVED OUR STAY. We are coming back very soon.

We chose the Getaway because we wanted a quiet, private spot where we could spend time together without a lot of distractions. We can’t say thank you enough for the beautiful, peaceful and relaxing stay. The cabin on wheels was very clean, minimalistic, and inviting. Our hosts provided everything we needed. It was private and quiet the whole time we were there. The views out the wall-size window above the bed were amazing and we didn’t complain about not having cell service or WiFi because we were able to focus on spending more time together. It’s an oasis just 20 mins from town🥰"

Fair warning, they’re not kidding when they say that service is spotty. I have Verizon and had 1 bar 99% of the time. So if you need music or videos etc. for your time, make sure you pre download it prior to your trip. All that being said, I had everything I needed in my little space and quickly fell into my own rhythm while there. I was there alone the entire time and felt completely safe. 100% would recommend!"

We LOVED our stay and are already planning to make it a yearly thing. The service is very spotty, with verizon I had a handful of places that could send and receive messages so it didn’t bother me. The drive to get to a walmart or good restaurants was at least 30 minutes but that also didn’t bother me. Last the sink water got very hot but the shower did not. But overall 10/10 I will recommend this place to anybody!"

The bed was comfy and the big glass window had a beautiful nature view which was very peaceful. I also walked down the road to the nature trail to hang out by the river for a bit. It’s probably about a 10 minute drive to town which was convenient. My favorite part was that all of the firewood and starters were included so I could have a fire every night. I’d definitely come back to stay here.

Stayed a few nights","I wish I could rate higher than 4 stars because the Getaway cabins really exceeded my expectations. I loved how peaceful the surrounds were and how the layout of the cabin was. I visited the cabins with my boyfriend, so we had both of our bags/luggage, and we were able to store everything without feeling cluttered. The fridge kept our food at a nice temperature. The cabins come equipped with A LOT of amenities, literally everything you could need, the only thing that was missing was a grill brush, but there was aluminum foil under the sink so we were still able to use the grill. The hosts are super responsive, we called ti get instructions to our specific cabin and they answer the first time and helped direct us even though we were sent a map. I 10/10 recommend esp if you are thinking about coming with your significant other. I can’t wait until we come back! Thank you Getaway for such a great experience!"

Stayed a few nights","The Getaway was a great mini vacation for my best friend and I. The drive was easy and finding the location was easy as well. We did arrive an hour early and the Getaway was able to accommodate us and let us into a cabin which was awesome. The cabin is very tiny but very clean. The bed was super comfortable and the shower was nice and hot. They provided us with free firewater and fire starters (we did not end up using) but it was a nice touch. I did email the staff to ask for two more towels and they were very responsive and accommodated our request quickly. Overall this is a great place for a weekend getaway where you want to disconnect and spend some quality time with friends or family. Oh! We were able find breakfast foods, grocery store, Walmart, and a local tattoo shop (Lola Rose) for some spontaneous best friend tattoos. :) Everything was very close and convenient. I will definitely be back again but next time when it’s cooler so I can enjoy a nice campfire. Thank you!"

Stayed one night","Beautiful little cabin! My husband and I visited on our way to Taladega speedway as part of our mini moon and this cabin was the perfect quiet night away. Peaceful, safe, and so quaint. We arrived just after dark so didn’t make use of the free firewood or s’mores, but they were such a sweet homely touch. The bed was super comfy, air con and heat was easy to use as it was a little chilly on arrival. We had a little bit of phone signal, but were excited to listen to the local radio and play card games all night. The view of the forest from the huge window was beautiful to wake up to. The only thing I would say is the angle of the shower head wasn’t great, I’m 5’2 and the water was just hitting me straight in the face haha! Best air bnb we have ever stayed in, every last detail was had been carefully thought out, down to tampons in the bathroom and citronella scented body wash to keep the bugs away! 10/10!"

Stayed a few nights","Wow! This place was everything I needed it to be and more for a fun getaway for my husband and I! Perfect for couples that want to reconnect or solo if you want a reset. It is very clean and new and has thus far been maintained really well. I cooked two meals inside. They supplied the things that they said they would as far as kitchen items. I brought my own of everything (just in case), but they had quality pans and knives. The on-site nature walk was fun and easy, definitely not a strenuous hike, but nice and relaxing. The built in radio inside was a nice touch. Shower is tight and I’m 5’2”, but very clean so not a problem. It was too hot for us to want to make a fire, but the instructions say not to gather wood for fire. They provide wood in a bin next to the fire pit, but it also says it’s for purchase but doesn’t say how much it is or how you are charged for it. I wish that was more clear, I would’ve messaged if we wanted to actually make a fire. 10/10!! Will definitely be back!:)"

There is a train that whistles but it only added to the charm for us. Dee Dee was very responsive, and they also offer firewood for sale at an affordable price. A little slice of heaven!"

Stayed about a week","We enjoyed our stay & plan to return. It's practically new, spotless, nice linens, furniture, & cozy. Cabins are situated such that you have nice privacy & the road/parking areas are clearly marked/easy access. There are places w/in the retreat to walk & explore. Also, a portion of Pinhoti Trail is w/in walking distance for a more challenging/longer hike (check AllTrails app). We loved the picture wall that showed/explained where much of the wood to build the cabins came from! We stayed during the winter, so w/ all the fallen leaves, we enjoyed the many ridge-line views. Nice sunrises on front porch & sunsets on back porch w/ plenty of seating options. We had 2 minor hick-ups, however the hosts were super friendly & promptly available to assist us. Seeing the numerous trains pass through during the days was quite interesting, but they can be loud during the nights if you are a light sleeper. Earplugs are in the nightstand drawers. Cell service can be spotty depending on your provider."

Group trip","The cabin and surroundings were beautiful. It was clean and inviting. Only downsides were the roads, lighting, and trains. The roads are gravel and steep. Not ideal for luxury cars. Perfect for trucks. SUVs or jeeps. The lighting in the parking area could have been better, really dark at night. Maybe, could use some motion lights in the parking area. There are motion lights on the cabin but the lighting does not reach the parking area. The train situation is what it is but there were trains moving all night. The cabin had the perfect decor for the surroundings and the showers are large. The beds were comfortable. The host was quick in responding to questions. I would return in the future and I would recommend this establishment to anyone seeking a nature scene."

We arrived well after dark about 10PM and the cabin is off the Main Street. To get to it you have to drive down a small road that makes you think you’re driving onto someone’s property. That’s OK because Cody responded immediately to our text when we asked about it.
Would I recommend it? Absolutely! My only hesitation is that if I do it might not be available the next time go back.

The microwave is a combination of microwave, air fryer and convection oven. We only used it for microwave. The shower controls took a little getting use to but nice. My husband saw three deers one morning. Beautiful lot and so peaceful. I messed up our reservation but Cody assisted us with my mistake. Great get away!"

We could have happily stayed longer at Lake Shack because we so enjoyed the home and the outdoor spaces. We will definitely return!
Also, Roxanne must be the kindest, most helpful host out there! We had serious car problem surprise us on the way, and Roxanne went out of her way to make sure my girls and I were taken care of while my husband got the car repaired. We are so grateful to her.

The water in the lake was down (rented in March) so it was difficult to get the kayaks in and out of the water but the host, Roxanne was very responsive and said that yes, she and her husband are thinking of building a ramp with a pulley for the months that the water is low.
They left us wood for the firepit and also have a gas firepit table on the bottom deck.
Will definently stay there again!"

The house is beautiful and exactly as pictured with all the amenities. From the first night, It felt more like home than just an empty house. I kept accidentally referring to the place as ""home"" while I was staying there! The owners communicated with me to offer support and were very responsive to my messages.

Stayed a few nights","Our stay October 20-22, 2023:
I rented this lake house for my wife's birthday weekend. One of the best vacation rentals we've had the pleasure of staying! Roxanne was an excellent host. The house was very clean, no weird odors, etc., the kitchen was fully stocked with everything we needed and more! There were plenty of snacks, a full assortment of condiments and spices, cooking utensils and even cupcakes that we really appreciated!
The location is very rural in a slough on the lake; however, it was extremely quiet for us and we did not see another person other than some fishermen in their boats in front of our pier in the early morning. We really enjoyed the peaceful atmosphere and viewing the beautiful nature. The fish were jumping in the early morning and early evening, geese were flying in out of the cove, squirrels in the trees, and their was a large blue heron that we watched in the morning from the deck. Overall this was an excellent experience for us. We will be back!"

The beds were extremely comfortable. The property looked as the pictures described. The host put a lot of thought and effort into making sure creature comforts like toiletry samples and other thoughtful items were provided. I even had a birthday surprise as the host knew I was coming to celebrate my birthday. The hosts took time to put together a handy information packet and the sunsets on the deck are some of the most beautiful lake sunsets I’ve seen. This place truly is a treasure. It felt like we were staying with family. (The kind we like 😁) We couldn’t ask for a better experience. We can’t wait to come back!"

John accepted our reservation almost immediately and offered local recommendations for food and entertainment. We arrived late and were delighted at the location, design, amenities & comfort of the unit. I met John the next morning while fetching something from our truck. He offered us sausage, bacon & Irish coffee (to go with the fresh eggs he had left for us) - which he then prepared for us and delivered to our front porch. The 3 of us then spent the next few hours chatting, eating, and laughing. He showed us his home, his property and entertained us with stories from his own crazy, interesting life. We left that day with plans to reconnect again & look forward to seeing him in the future. I recommend his Airbnb without hesitation - he is simply killing the game!"

Surrounded by minimal light pollution, the night sky's stars were a breathtaking sight. The tranquility, accentuated by the soft whispers of nature, offered a serene escape, especially during quiet times of the nearby racetrack.
The cabin skillfully balances rustic charm with modern amenities, featuring strong Wi-Fi and a streaming-ready HD TV. The highlight was the cozy Jacuzzi, perfect for enjoying the cool, peaceful nights.
John's attentiveness as a host was remarkable, ensuring our comfort with prompt communication and thoughtful touches like fresh eggs from his chickens. This cabin is not just a place to stay but an unforgettable experience, and we eagerly anticipate our next visit."

Stayed about a week","We had a wonderful stay at Hunters. We did have to work remotely during our stay and appreciated the one work place. Would have been helpful to have another table but we made it work. Beds and linens were comfortable and was refreshing to have towels that weren't thin and worn out from previous guests. Check the kitchenware, several plates, glasses and silverware not cleaned well. That, of course, is not reflective of Hunter but more so the previous guests. Should the cleaning people have to spot check that? I don't know."

The area was so quiet and beautiful after being in the car for 10 hours. We loved seeing the kids next-door and across the street playing outside, it made us feel at home and safe. Neighbors were friendly. You can tell Hunter really took pride in the updates and charm of the house. It was the perfect size for my husband, our son, and myself. We were super close to the gas station and a Walgreens (we needed some sinus medication once we got there). And checkout / cleanup was super easy and low maintenance. Would highly recommend if you need a place to stay in the area. We even talked about wanting to move here, it was beautiful!"

We did have a question for Hunter even before arriving, and he was very quick to respond. The inside of the cottage was decorated so cute, well-appointed, and had all the necessary tools we needed to prepare our meals. Having dinner on the back porch and enjoying the beautiful backyard while we had dinner was a real bonus! We absolutely would stay at the Coldwater Cottage again if our travels take us through Anniston. Thank you, Hunter!"

Can’t beat the fenced in backyard and quiet neighborhood when traveling with a dog either.
The host also provided recommendations to check out in the area, and he was very responsive and communicative throughout my stay. 5/5 across the board from me."

Stayed with kids",We loved our stay at Hunter’s beautiful cottage. Hunter is an excellent host and his home is beautiful and so clean. Hunter checked on us through out our stay. He also answered our questions very quickly. We will definitely be back to what we now consider our Sweet Home In Alabama. Thank you Hunter for having us.

Stayed one night","Love, Love, Love! The house was just as described, it was decorated beautifully and the beds were so comfy! The kitchen was well stocked
And had everything we needed
To cook a meal. Perfect place to stop if you are traveling or in the area for an event or to visit! The outdoor space was wonderful and relaxing on the patio with an outdoor fountain. There is an area with a fire pit and chairs we didn’t use but would be perfect for roasting hot dogs or s’mores or just hanging out. I will stay here again and recommend. Hunter is a great host!"

Stayed with kids","Every room had a window until running (unlike photos). The patio is totally different from the listing. The pool has no handrail at the shallow end and no ladder in the deep end (unlike photos). Both were gone, w/ the metal left uncovered and jagged in the ground. In the pool on our 1st full day our 7 y/o started saying his hand felt “funny” and he wasn’t able to grip. We found there was a low-grade electrical current coming from the edge of the pool. An adult tested the area and felt intense tingling in his hand & the hairs on the back of his arm & neck stood up. The host said they could not address until after checkout. We asked for a 1-night refund of $395 (total was $1,700) to cover a boat rental for the day that we didn’t have a pool. The host sent $100. She says there was nothing wrong with the pool. We have no reason to lie about this. This host is not going to provide you with an accurate listing, so I will. I have plenty of photos. Don’t risk it, book with a Superhost instead"

Group trip","Beautiful location on the lake which was nice. The pool was nice to have as well. I would certainly rent again if available but only on a non-holiday weekend next time due to the higher rate. Very peaceful and the host, Margaret and her husband, were very responsive. The water heater went out on us during the stay but they had it replaced same day (very appreciative of them doing that for us!). The only downside was that the upstairs area/bedrooms were a bit warm and the thermostat was set such that we could not lower it to cool things down. All-in-all, great place to rent especially with the beautiful view."

We will be visiting again in the summer so that we can have access to the pool! I will recommend this house to any one who is looking for a spacious and peaceful house

Stayed a few nights","Andy and Lara’s lake house is beautiful, clean, and made us feel right at home. The house was decorated beautifully, offered great “things to do” such as a pool table, ping pong, and a beautiful view with plenty of seating options.
The only discrepancies that keep it from being a 5/5 stars are the driveway grade and the lack of photos and description of the stairs and driveway prior to booking. The driveway is very steep and almost non accessible if you don’t have a 4wd truck (thankfully we drove our dually), there are a few flights of stairs to go down and up to get to and from the front door. We don’t require any handicap accessibility, but I am recovering from two pelvis fractures, so it would have been nice to see the stairs in the photos and read that in the description prior to booking. Other than that the property was amazing, clean, beautiful, and Andy and Lara were fantastic hosts. We will definitely book with them again if we’re ever back in the area!"

Stayed with kids","Hello, we are a family of 5 from Florida. We did a road trip from Miami to Alabama, and decided to stay in this cabin. The location is great! Not too far from Birmingham and you can travel to Cheah state park in the area.
The view from the cabin is amazing, and the cabin itself is specious and has everything you need.
Compare to other Airbnb that I visited it truly has everything! Towels, shampoo, conditioner ( full size), equipped kitchen with the basics: olive oil, vinegar, salt, pepper and some other items. There is a pool table and plenty of board games. Fire pit outside and a grill.
Our kids are 12,10,5 and they loved the cabin.
Parking wasn’t bad at all as other reviews described. I just think that it’s better to arrive at daylight ( it’s getting dark at 5 PM).
Host was very friendly and checked from time to time if everything is good.
Highly recommended!"

Stayed a few nights","Andy and Lara’s property made for the perfect weekend getaway for me and my two teenaged children. As an architect, I loved the design, materials, furnishings, and decorations. It is a warm and welcoming home. The pool table, dart board, and table tennis top on the lower level were a highlight of the trip. The house is equipped with all the amenities you could need. On discovering that the grill was out of gas just hours before dinner, Andy and Lara had a new tank sent over! The home is super comfy and well laid out, with different areas on each level to hang out. We ate in the dining room one night, had breakfast on the upper porch one morning, and ate a few meals right at the kitchen island on bar stools. My daughter loves to fish and was able to catch a few little brim from the dock. The home itself is a destination, without the need for outside activities, although, we did go for a hike in the Talladega National Forest about an hour away. It was a perfect bonding weekend."

Stairs to home need wood replaced due to weathering. The setting of home in remote dark road could use more landscape lights alone staircase. The strategic design of driveway can cause car to get stuck depending on type. Must instruct rentals to place the car in 1st gear to get up the hill! Overall, a lovely vacation home.

We all agreed we'd never stayed somewhere with such a beautiful view. we had 4 adults and 4 kids of all ages and we all had a phenomenal time. From family dinners in the open concept kitchen/ living/ dining space, to playing pool and ping pong, to swimming and sitting by the lake, this home had so many fun things for us to do. We had our privacy but our hosts always responded very quickly and were so helpful.
One word of advice, if you come with kids, establish a rule that they DO NOT touch the alarm system. One of our kids saw the alarm system and thought it was a tv or iPad and tried to play with it and ended up triggering a panic alarm and calling the police. Our hosts were understanding but please avoid our mistake! 😂"

We enjoyed the use of the pool table and darts board. The outdoor area is fantastic with incredible views of the lake and we loved spending time by the water and having bbq's in the evening. We also hired a boat for the day from Poor House Branch Marina which was a good way to see more of the area.
The place is well equipped for everything you might need and Andy and Lara had thought about everything to make our stay so enjoyable. They were great hosts-  responsive and helpful leading up to our stay and during the time we were there.
The area itself is quiet and peaceful. If you did want to venture out then Pell City is a few minutes drive away and we enjoyed a meal at Docks Bar & Grill and also at Shack BBQ (very close to the property).
We cannot recommend staying here enough!!!!"

The two levels of porches and balconies were amazing. Although we always take our own, the house was fully stocked with anything you could ever need even down to shampoo and body wash. I have never seen a place with so many personal touches everywhere. We cooked every meal there and everything was at our fingertips. The game room was a huge plus for us at night and during rainy periods.
I cannot say enough about the views. Having morning coffee while looking over the Coosa River with my Grandbabies by my side was amazing.
My favorite thing about the weekend was that the TVs were NEVER turned on. There’s too much fun to be had here. Relaxation and family time at its best!"

Amazing outdoor spots with lots of seating- porch, deck, and dock. My family also enjoyed the basement with pool table/ping pong and darts. Great kitchen and comfy beds. We will absolutely stay here again next time we visit Logan Martin!"

Group trip","We picked this place because it seemed comfortable and unique. It was both of those. The first floor is 3 bed 2 bath, plus a large open kitchen which is open to the living room w/ TV. The first half day it rained. The kitchen and the living room open up onto a covered porch with 2 big sliding glass doors. So you could be in the house and it was almost like being outside. Very nice. The porch is also furnished and we ate a couple of meals out there.
The adult kids played downstairs. Pool, ping pong, darts and watched some movies. This room is also open to a deck and a swing.
From there you take the stairs to the lake, where floaties, a swing and the lake await you. Of course there was a lot of swimming involved.
The house is nicely appointed. Live plants, comfortable furniture, nice layout.
I cooked five full meals for 8 people. The kitchen had every thing I needed to cook with including a grill. Wonderful place."

A whole game room with pool table and ping-pong table downstairs. House was right on the lake and had stellar views! We would definitely stay here again :)

Group trip",Hands down the best Airbnb we’ve stayed in! We loved everything about our stay and just wish it would’ve been warmer outside so we could enjoy the water! If you are looking for a beautiful vacation home look no further. The house is very spacious and you don’t feel crammed even with 8. Andy is extremely responsive and a great host.

Stayed with kids","The place was beautiful and well maintained. We have three kids and they loved climbing up and down the hill and drinking hot chocolate by the fire pit at night. The pool table, ping pong and swing were also a big hit. My husband and I really enjoyed the view. Lara & Andy thought of everything we might need and communicated to make sure we had everything we needed. It was a great experience and long weekend away for us."

Stayed a few nights","We spent a lovely January weekend here taking in the lake views.
The house was super comfortable, and had all the amenities needed to cook and relax. The outdoor screened porch and decks were amazing. Lots of stairs down to the house and to the water, but both were worth it for the experience.
The internet streamed very fast, and there was plenty of space to spread out and work.
Would love to return on a summer day."

Group trip","Was looking for a nice relaxing get away before the hecticness of the new year kicks in, and that’s exactly what we got. Beautiful view and loved having our own dock to fish off of, even took the kayak out for a spin. House was decorated beautifully and loved how big the master bedroom was. We got to enjoy coffee in the porch swing in the mornings and ended the day having a beer and shooting some pool. My only complaint is the driveway was nerve wracking, but only because we’re not used to driving on that steep an incline. Nice quiet location with everything you could need! We’ll definitely be coming to stay again in the future!"

Stayed with a pet","This was a great place to stay - we had 5 women and 5 dogs, so we definitely pushed the limits of the space, but we made it work. The house is adorable, cozy and comfortable. It has a great front porch and backyard. The dogs were able to run around, and the front porch was a safe in-between place for coming and going.
Kinley was super responsive to all my questions and made the stay easy and comfortable. She set up an air mattress for us since we had more people than beds."

Stayed a few nights","great little spot, the host was fantastic and very helpful, and it was pretty close to the Talladega speed way.
only concern was that my buddy is pretty sure he heard a drive by a few blocks away, I can't really confirm if that's what it was, but it was loud nevertheless.
overall had a great stay and would definitely stay here again next time."
