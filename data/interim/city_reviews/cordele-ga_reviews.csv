Stayed with kids","Absolutely loved this stay! Jeff was super friendly and responsive. The home was clean, and the kitchen was hands down my happy place. Every morning waking to see the beautiful lake and sun shining through the windows was serene.
We realized last year when traveling with kids ages 8-15, we need space where we can feel at home and relax. This was everything I could ask for.
After hours of travel, everyone had their own space. The beds were very comfortable.
We will absolutely look to stay here again for our next family reunion."

Stayed with kids","Hello everyone, let me just start off by saying God is so good. This Air BNB was a wonderful experience we loved it. My family and I (family of 5) had to stay here for 1 month because our home flooded. We really enjoyed staying here it was really nice. The owner of the Air BNB is super friendly. He was in contact with us the whole time. We didn’t want to leave this place because it felt some much like home. The Air BNB accommodated our family size plus it was really clean and spacious. We will be booking again in the future.
Thanks so much Mr. Jeff for your warm welcomes, and great hospitality."

This home has its own boat ramp and dock for your toys. Our family had plenty of bedroom space, and living room seating to enjoy the football games. Even though we didn't cook during our stay, there was
a very nice kitchen to cook with plenty of seating for the family of 8 or more. We will definitely be back in the future. Thank you Jeff for all your communication."

He is a lineman and worked very hard so we just wanted to get away and relax. Jeff’s home was very homey and welcoming! Jeff is one of the nicest home owners that I’ve dealt with and we look forward to booking with him again in the future! Beautiful, peaceful, and relaxing home again! We thank you for allowing us to stay!!!"

Stayed with kids","The Lake House was everything we could have asked for. It was nicely decorated - with a spacious open floor plan. Everything was well stocked with necessities and plenty of linens, towels etc. The kitchen had everything you would need to prepare your own meals or it is only a short ride to a number of local eatery's if cooking is not part of your vacation plan ;-) The night before our stay there was a bad storm and Jeff drove 70 miles to check everything out and resolved some electrical issues but there was one unforeseen problem with the well caused by the storm that was not apparent until two days later - he rushed a maintenance crew within the hour after we reported the problem and also made the drive again personally thankfully they were able to resolve the issue quickly so that we could continue to enjoy our stay. We hope to return again!"

The house was large enough to accommodate 8 adults and a few children. The kitchen is spacious. The pool table was a fun activity for our group. We thoroughly enjoyed the screened porch and outdoor deck each morning and evening. Be sure to spend time on the dock but if a larger party bring an extra chair or blanket. Sunsets are amazing! We will be back!

The house is all one level which is attractive for people like us who are avoiding steps. The interior has been remodeled; decorated in up-to-date, sophisticated style. Quality furnishings. Well stocked and outfitted for convenience and comfort. There is a carport and covered walkway that will get you and luggage to the entry without getting rained on. Quiet and private neighborhood yet close to the recreation features of the Park. We liked everything about the house and our stay."

The house was super clean and we loved the goodies left out for us. The dock was a good size for us to all fit while fishing. There’s a small cement ramp that made putting the kayaks in and out super easy too. Loved the seating options as well! The beds were super comfy and the master bathroom was really roomy. Anything I forgot, they had! Q-tips, body wash, seasoning, etc. Thank you again for your quick responses and hospitality, we loved Cabernet Cove! I’ll be using my custom coozie at home to remind me of a great weekend :)"

The wide screened porch on the back of the house was perfect for everything - dining, game-playing, watching the kids splash the pool, or just enjoying the view. When inside, the high ceilinged, light-filled interiors make this house feel more akin to Alys Beech than rural Georgia. The quality of everything was excellent, from the well-curated furniture and lighting to the beautifully designed pool. This home is truly a retreat."

Stayed about a week","My family has been vacationing in various homes in Georgia for about 20 years. This is the best on. We hope to come back here year after year. The setting is on Lake Blackshear and there is a boathouse that you can fish off. The pool is the perfect size to swim in and has very comfortable lounge chairs with umbrellas. The house is perfect for vacationing with each of the 3 bedrooms having its own bathroom. The decorating is French Chic and besides being beautiful, it is comfortable and thoughtful. The back screen porch overlooks the pool and lake, and birds are plentiful. Next time we're bringing binoculars. The kitchen is well equipped with everything you need."

Everything was in top notch shape and our host, Susan, was perfect. We had kayaks delivered and we could enter the lake right off the end of the boathouse. When we weren't on the lake or in the pool, we were playing board games on the screened in porch or inside where the AC was more than enough to handle some hot, midsummer Georgia days. It was a perfect location for a family of four looking to recharge. If you find this property available, don't hesitate to snatch it up!"

Stayed a few nights","The little “river shack” is a great place for people who love the LAID BACK lake life - There’s nothing fancy about it BUT IN MY EYES IT IS PERFECT! It is exactly what Margaret described - There’s space for a family . The shower isn’t built for tall people but we are tall and we managed just fine! The place is efficient - most certainly… and Margaret is a great host!
If you’re allergic to poison Ivy then keep your eyes peeled if you plan on walking around in the yard; the parking area, the walkway and porch are clear of poison vines though. Porch is great- neighbors are laid back and nice. We will most definitely be back to the little “river shack”. Perfect little place if you’re looking for a place to eat, bathe and sleep after a day at the lake- Oh! The beds ARE super comfy- I’ve traveled alot and I’ve booked some of the most high-end houses- I usually have a hard time resting on the first night at a new place- but not at the river shack! 10 stars for it being a peaceful place!!"

Stayed one night","I just want to say we were looking for a secure place to park our small uhaul car trailer driving from Florida to Ohio, so we wouldn’t have to worry about it at night like we would at a roadside hotel. I was familiar with the area from 25 years ago and found what we were looking for. After we checked in we had a family health crisis develop that we did not plan for and it delayed us about 5 hours from planned arrival. Margaret was very helpful and understanding about our evolving situation and was very flexible under our emergency. It is a fishing camp. It is very reasonably priced and it is clean. The beds were wonderfully comfortable and we enjoyed the very peaceful porch on a Sunday morning. It happened to be foggy the entire time we were there and with the Spanish moss hanging off the trees gave it such a cool atmosphere.
I highly recommend this fishing camp. It is not a high end airbnb so dont come expecting, come expecting a great place to quietly enjoy South Georgia."

The bed that we slept in was unfortunately extremely uncomfortable and sinking towards the middle which made it a little difficult to sleep with two people. But it was okay for just one night. Also worth noting if you’re over 6ft you also may have a little trouble showering (the shower head is at around 5’).

I recommend a microwave and a couple extra chairs at the table. The bed in the back bedroom could use a new mattress as the one there caves in the middle so you feel as if you are in a hole. The septic tank seems to need emptied as when you shower the toilet bubbles up and the tub doesn’t drain correctly.

Was not a fan of the extremely small shower that the two larger bedrooms had to share and the fact that it’s jack and Jill lay out so not super private. We all ended up using the kids bathroom off the living room due to the shower being large and the third full bathroom is outside downstairs so not convenient. Did not have internet or dish for the kids to watch/use the entire time which was a bummer for them. Also be aware of wasp! Our daughter was stung the first day followed by two other members of the family. Overall the house is beautiful and we would consider staying again.

I’m so glad it worked out. The internet is spotty through no fault of the hosts- it’s just the area the house is in. I recommend doing what we did and just not trying to use our devices to focus entirely on friends and family. Every guest was celebrating our liberation from our devices. The phone reception was just fine. The interiors of this place have inspired me in my own home renovations. I just can’t say enough nice things!

Quiet and peaceful if you’re by yourself, but spacious enough for a family gathering.
The host communication was excellent, and we had no issues while we were there."

Stayed with kids","This lake house was beautiful and in a prime location!! Our family loved the long weekend on the water!! Host, Christina, was great and very accommodating! She willing to help with any need we had. Downstairs was huge and right on the water with plenty of room for boats to tie up. There is also a full bathroom with shower and a kitchen downstairs so no need to go back and forth when hanging out on the water! Upstairs was really nice and up to date, just remodeled and very very clean! Plenty of room for everyone to sleep and hang out. We really enjoyed our time here and I believe we would buy this house if it ever went on the market! The two recommendations we had after our stay is to add a ladder on the dock to use while swimming and shades/curtains for the upstairs windows at night for privacy."

We were down in the area visiting family who was sick and made the reservation very last minute. Larry was not expecting guests and quickly contacted the cleaning crew to come in and get the place in great condition in a matter of hours. Such a wonderful break at the end of the day to come back and have such a peaceful place to relax. The back porch was such a wonderful and unexpected treat!

The cottage was very clean and stylish and comfort at it's finest with everything I needed. I will most definitely return to Larry's cottag on the lake.

The inside of the cabin was clean and well appointed. We stayed over a long weekend and found it relaxing. One suggestion is to use bug spray- we found it buggy when we were enjoying the outdoors so we recommend snagging the bug spray when you come. The lake view was worth it- you’ll love the tranquility! Thank you for sharing your home with us!

Stayed a few nights","Be aware that there is a slanted bank down to the dock. Unsafe dock, nails and screws sticking out of wood, much of the dock is rotting, and it’s leaning and wobbly. The hot tub cover is heavy and falling apart so it was hard to move. The windows and sills were filthy and didn’t have screens. They were disgusting. The grill had food stuck to it when we arrived. Bring your own pillows. Needs Comfortable chairs for outside. A few details and this could be more romantic. It would have been nice to have the windows open with the nice breeze. It was hard to sit in the sun in the wood chairs for any length of time. A beautiful view and overall peaceful. Bathroom and kitchen were clean. Fresh sheets provided."

Stayed a few nights",Most peaceful place we've stayed in a long time. Beautiful surrounding lake. Lovely cabin. We enjoyed the hot tub and relaxing on the dock and by the fire. The sunsets over the water were amazing sights to behold. Very private and quiet area. We will stay there again!

Stayed with a pet","My husband and I came with our pups last minute because we had a 18 hour drive ahead of us, so we decided to find an Airbnb on the way home to break up the drive. We found Sherrys airbnb and decided to take a 2 day driving break, when we showed up we both immediately took out our cameras and were snapping pictures. It was 5pm and it was golden hour and the lake was breathtaking, we walked inside and just kept saying “omg wow, wow, wow this is gorgeous wow, I’m so happy we are here”. Over and over again, we were both so excited to be there. It’s private, has everything, gorgeous, the hot tub was so nice and great (the cover is heavy, that’s my only complaint). We plan on coming back for another stay, but longer. 2 days wasn’t enough.
Lots of homie touches, she left us a bottle of wine and it was nice to read everything everyone wrote in the guest book about their stay, what they loved and things Sherry did for them. Overall, 5 stars! Highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","Cordele, oh Cordele!
Our stay at Sherry and Trae's lake house was phenomenal! The drive down was gorgeous with the leaves changing and wide open farm land, the check-in process was a no-contact breeze, and the home itself is the perfect size for a couples getaway. A stunning panoramic view of the lake from the kitchen/den area and the sliding windows that let in fresh air and sounds of the lake were incredible, but my absolute favorite luxury amenities would have to be the clawfoot tub and in-deck hot tub. Sherry & Trae also thoughtfully provided nice and thick robes for us use. Although we brought our own, now we could keep them dry and wear them around the bnb to feel extra warm and cozy. We felt safe, and secluded immediately upon walking in and because we mentioned that this was our first anniversary trip, and they were kind enough to leave a bottle of wine for us! 10/10 would visit this bnb again and recommend it to friends!"

They made sure we had all the information we needed for a smooth arrival and checked in a little afterward to make sure everything was in order. They were welcoming and hospitable and though they were onsite at another residence, they did not impose whatsoever. The cabin is lovely. It is very cozy and though it has a smaller footprint, we never felt crowded with 2 adults and 2 dogs. Each space in the cottage is thoughtfully furnished and arranged. With ease you can watch tv from the living room, kitchen, or bedroom if you like. There is a beautiful view to enjoy through lake facing windows in the living room, kitchen, and the bedroom via french doors that serve as the main entrance. We enjoyed peaceful mornings on the dock drinking coffee. The area is quiet without feeling remote. The kayaks provided are easy to get in/out of via steps into the lake by the boathouse. We had a wonderful stay; highly recommended!"

Stayed with kids","Cabin is very basic, as in the pictures. The outside lacks basic maintenance and cleaning. Cabin was not well stocked at all and some spots lacked cleaning. It is private-ish and has a good lake view. Not sure how well I trust the dock. The water equipment was available but it is on someone else’s property, or at least that’s what it will feel like when you try to go use it. The beds are comfortable and it is quiet at night. We had nothing to light the grill with and no firewood for the fire pit. It was an ok deal for the price but I would not stay again. The property has a lot of potential but unfortunately zero investment or interest from the owners."

If you need a slow down of pace for a few days this is the place to go.

We were even left a bottle of wine! It was quaint, peaceful, and romantic. We enjoyed the hot tub, sound of the water, and the amazing sunsets.

The cabin was so clean, sweet, and romantic. We had everything we needed, including our choice of coffee (drip or Keurig), and beautiful sunsets while relaxing in the hot tub.

Stayed a few nights","This place is really all about location, location, location!!!
You are right on the lake with the most beautiful views. It is also very quiet, peaceful and relaxing. We enjoyed our stay but to be completely honest; we were not impressed with the outside of the place. It desperately needs a lot of TLC. Loose boards on the deck as well as some rotting boards. I understand with all the trees you can't keep it leaf free. But it would be nice to just blow the area off before guests' check-in to make sure it is somewhat cleaned up. It is obvious it has been a while since anything has been done to the outside. By the hot tub, while sitting in their chairs, there was a small tree that had actually grown up through the deck. That doesn't happen overnight and just shows how long since anyone has done any upkeep.
As for inside, the living room area does need some updating. The couch and chair are old and very uncomfortable. For the price, I would at the very least expect comfortable furniture."

We had a few issues due to unusually cold winter weather for the area with freezing temperatures, the owners were very responsive to messages and went above and beyond to fix the issues so we were able to enjoy our stay more comfortably... It warmed up enough for us to enjoy the hot tub one evening, the chimnea made it warm and cozy... We cooked on the grill and really enjoyed the dock area... The fishing was great, my huband caught probably 40 big catfish right off the dock.. It was too cold for us to try out the kayaks they provide, but they did allow us to use the dock and live well at the main house at the bottom of the hill, which helped a lot. Things to do within a 30 minute ride, so great location. Would love to return in warmer weather. Would recommend if you are looking for a getaway at the lake..."

Stayed with a pet","I really like the location of this cabin. It’s right on the lake at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac.
It has a full kitchen, the bathroom was recently renovated, and the living area is fine for a couple.
This cabin would have received great reviews if it wasn’t for the fact that the exterior has been sadly neglected. All the patio furniture is moldy and mildewed. The cabin has beautiful window boxes and pots for plants. But the plants were all dead and hadn’t been cleaned up.
If the owners cleaned up the outside, I would recommend staying here. However, units current state, it’s not very conducive to spending time outside on the deck."

Stayed a few nights","This cute and cozy little cabin was just what we needed. The location on the lake is perfect to catch beautiful sunsets.
The bed was super comfortable, it was clean, the hot tub was fabulous and perfect for star gazing.
Pup friendly had us sold. We enjoyed using the kayaks on the lake as well as drinking some complimentary wine while building one of their puzzles.
The location is pretty remote, which we didn’t mind, but do suggest you buy groceries prior to arriving. The local store is quite expensive due to the rural area.
We took a day trip (about 1hr 15 min away) to Providence Canyon and highly recommend.
The door to get in and out is kind of hard to get to lock so just be mindful when leaving that it’s truly locked. Honestly you likely have nothing to worry about as it seems like a very safe area but just FYI.
The dock was a little run down so be sure to wear shoes and there may be quite a bit of bugs but the sunsets were unbeatable.
Overall we highly recommend staying at this cute little cabin. ☺️"

Shade, sun and everything in between. We had great fun watching the birds, geese and the hawk that made twice daily trips across the lake with catches of fish. The docks gave us many options of sitting, sipping, casting and watching. Will definitely book again!"

Stayed with a pet",This cabin was perfect for our stay at Lake Blackshear. We enjoyed the lake view and fishing off of the dock. The cabin was clean and had all of the necessities to make the stay enjoyable. We caught plenty of bream and catfish off of the dock. My kids loved using the kayaks. The owners are very nice and communicate well. We plan to come back and stay again.

My husband and I had a great little getaway; our dogs enjoyed watching the squirrels out of the windows and swimming around in the lake. The kayaks and paddle board were a lot of fun. The sunsets from the dock were absolutely gorgeous (make sure you wear shoes down there, got a bad splinter!) Would recommend bringing bug spray but other than that we had everything we needed to cook and everything supplied at the cabin.
I would 100% recommend taking a little getaway here, we will likely be back!"

Besides the view, the amenities helped to sell this place for me. We enjoyed having the ability to be active if we wanted and explore. Kayaking during the day, grilling dinner and bonfires at night by the jacuzzi. The surprise was all the bird watching we were about to do in the mornings. We appreciated the personal touches inside the cabin as well. A bottle of wine was left for us and the kitchen was well stocked with stuff to help us cook with. Everything about this place was very welcoming and cozy."

And the cabin is just perfect for what we wanted, so cozy and comfortable and had everything we needed for our getaway. It was so quiet and peaceful except for when the construction crews were next-door working on the big house. And even they weren’t very loud just a saw every once in a while. So I’m sure when that’s done it will be even more peaceful. We would LOVE to come back! We actually love this area so much we were looking at property listings before we left. The lake is gorgeous and the people are very nice."

We had so much fun with the kayaks and paddle board, and were welcomed to dock our boat securely at the owners boathouse. Communication with the owners was fast and pleasant. The cabin was well-stocked with coffee, seasonings, and toiletries. The bottle of wine was nice as well! We’d recommend packing several extra sets of clothes since there is not a washer or dryer, and some paper plates and plasticware since there’s not a dishwasher. If you’re looking for a small, quaint place to stay a few days - with excellent views- this is your place!"

We appreciated the amazing views from everywhere, the hot tub and the private fock for fishing. The kitchen is well stocked if, like us, you prefer to cook. The Kuerig was a blessing for us!
The cabin is in a residential area, very close to the hosts property. This in no was was a problem for us but of you want that middle of nowhere feel this is not the place for you. The only downside we had was a lack of curtains, so when the dun comes up the cabin gets really bright quickly.
We would highly recommend this place, it was a truly relaxing weekend away for us."

Stayed a few nights","We had a wonderful time in this cozy lake house cabin. The living area with its wraparound windows was the best place to just unwind, read, journal, and chat. It has great views right over the water and got great afternoon sun for the cold winter stay.
The hot tub was also heavenly! Especially the second night when we moved the chimnea by it and had a fire for the cold night. The first night we took the cover off before it warmed up but learned our lesson the second night to let it warm up before taking the cover off.
I was also pleasantly surprised by the full kitchen which isn’t pictured in the listing.
Also, the view of the open whitewashed rafters when laying down in bed is a real treat! We felt like we were in a boathouse.
Such a luxurious and relaxing girls’ weekend! Hope to come back again soon!"

The outdoor space is great with a beautiful view of the lake. It did not affect my parents, but I will add that the outside has a bit a decline in order to access the dock so proceed with care. When we visited my parents, our kids had fun sliding down the small hill. Lol! And the bonfire near the water is a nice touch. All in all a very nice experience for my parents. Would rent again no doubt."

There are a few restaurants in the area, about 20 mins to get to, if you want to explore the area. We also highly recommend 'Rail House Tavern,' which is in downtown cordele for food and drinks."

Kayaks were great, and the town was pretty close for necessities, but mostly we just hung around and definitely utilized the hot tub to truly relax out there! Probably just a seasonal thing, but I should note that the gnats were insane; we could barely sit outside in the day time. On the last day, the AC actually went out as well, but we just ended up checking out early since our stuff was all packed. The host was super quick to respond and get it fixed though, even let me know what went wrong and apologized. Thanks so much for the stay!"

Stayed a few nights","Perfect space for a couple’s getaway. Everything you need and a few extras like seasonings and coffee. The outside space is just as enjoyable as the interior. The main house is only a few yards from the rental space so if you prefer privacy, take note. The occupants of the main house were away during our stay so it wasn’t an issue but I think the proximity between the two is worth mentioning. We did not use the hot tub but it was clean and warm. The bbq grill and fire pit were nice editions but unfortunately the firewood is kept outside and it had rained before our arrival and was therefore wet. The back deck and the dock at sunset were worth the stay alone! The cabin was a lovely experience overlooking the lake! Would definitely stay again!"

The bed was heaven, we slept like babies The kayaks and paddle boards they offer are so nice. We used the kayaks daily. We had fresh caught fish from the lake our first night. Sherry and Trae invited us to their farm and we were able to meet all their furbabies! We can't get back soon enough! Tammy Hembree and Bob Hornfeck"

It was better than the photos and the description. There are plenty of stores and eateries near by, like 15 minutes away. Stores and eateries that you actually know and recognize. There's plenty of to do on or off the lake. The getting there was an equally beautiful adventure.
I do desire to go back myself AND strongly recommend this property to anyone vaguely interested an absolutely beautiful, luxurious, peaceful vacay."

The house was exactly as described, and the 4 bedrooms were great to have. Our baby even had his own little room in the bunk area. There is a lot of comfortable sitting area inside, and of course outside was fabulous as well.
If we ever have a reason to head down to South Georgia again, we would definitely stay here again. Thank you!"

They accommodated everything we needed from the hospitality to the necessities for a get away. My favorite part was a baby longhorn was born the day we stayed and Susan introduced us to all of the animals and told us a little bit of their history. We went fishing by the pond and caught 3 bass and laid out in the swing. 10/10 recommend this place for a quick cute farm stay!

Stayed with kids","This has been one of our favorite places to stay! We booked it as a quick stop on our way back home & wish we could have stayed longer! Susan & Barry were excellent hosts-so friendly & kind. Since we were getting in a little late, Susan asked if she can make the extra beds for the kids. Very thoughtful & that same thoughtful shows in this property. The place itself is super clean & stocked with all you need. The views are amazing to wake up to, such a beautiful & peaceful place. (& only 10 mins off I75). Our kids went out in the morning as Susan & Barry were tending their animals & they let them join right in! To say they were excited would be an under statement-they were begging to stay longer & have more of their questions answered about the animals. We spent a great morning watching the animals & learning about farm life. It was quite the experience and we hope to be back next year! Thanks so much for everything Susan and Barry-it was so nice to meet you! God bless!"

They have wonderful animals and breathtaking nature that simply takes your breath away. It was especially nice to find a postcard and little hearts left on the table for us upon arrival - it was a truly heartwarming touch. The atmosphere of this place is simply magical, and we felt like we were in a fairy tale. We definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for coziness and peace surrounded by nature.

The location is a particular standout, in beautiful countryside with acreage, lake stocked with fish, birdsong, starry nights and the friendliest cows (and dogs and goats) I ever met! The cottage itself is SPACIOUS, nicely decorated, spotlessly clean and well stocked for comfort. The big kitchen with seating and views to the pasture is lovely, as is the living room for cuddling up on the couch with a book. I also appreciated the adjustable climate zones, and Susan and Barry's fast help when I couldn't figure out how to set the temps! I look forward to the opportunity to return."

Stayed with a pet","these people are super kind and compassionate. it's obvious that they take pride in this venture. although the home is older, it's definitely the cleanest older home I've ever been in. places spotless. I'm a maid and it passes the white glove test :))). we did not use the master bedroom as we had a sick dog so we slept in the guest room in the Twin and the queen air mattresses. us being older, the air mattress wasn't very comfortable. it would be fine for a child or younger person. the twin was super comfortable but the frame did make noise when you roll over. there is a train that goes by occasionally. we always travel with a white noise machine so it was no problem. will definitely book again on the next trip from Florida. Also, looks like a tiny house in the backyard that appeared to be occupied. not sure if it was the owners or another rental. Thank you Dennys:)"

We will definitely book here when traveling in the future. The accommodations inside were so thoughtful down to a fully stocked coffee bar, soaps in the bathroom, towels, WiFi, local tv, dog bowls, and a purified water spout.

However, not easy to find. Mailbox hanging sideways with only partial numbers. No driveway to speak of so we didn’t know where to turn into. We passed it twice. I messaged her that we couldn’t find it she told us to go to the road near but it didn’t have a road sign so that didn’t help. After driving all day we just wanted to relax. My husband was frustrated. We use air bnb every trip for the past 5 seasons and this was the most frustrating experience we have had. There was no welcome page to let us know house instructions nor WiFi.

Group trip","Worked perfect for us for a family gathering for a wedding at a nearby wedding venue. Leon was nice to allow us an early check in since we had multiple guests arriving from out of town who needed to freshen up and dress for the rehearsal and dinner that early evening of check in. We utilized all 5 bedrooms so everyone had their own space.
We were so busy with the rehearsal dinner and the wedding that we really didn’t get to spend any time enjoying the amenities, but I am sure the pool and the ability to dock a boat for a longer stay would be wonderful.
With our hectic schedule we only had time to enjoy one quick lunch and 2 breakfasts during our visit, but we had everything that we needed during our stay, and it was very convenient that we all got to visit during what little down time we had instead of having to all stay in separate hotel rooms."

Clean, gorgeous and private with a beautiful view of the lake. Comfortable beds and furniture had young and old feeling right at home. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a little piece of South Georgia heaven."

Stayed with kids",We had to take a large family to Cordele with very little notice for a funeral. I found this house and it had enough beds to accommodate everyone. We loved the space in this home. The kitchen was large and dining table was fabulous for us to enjoy meals together. We were able to gather in the living room for fellowship. The outdoor space was beautiful and peaceful. The kids loved the game room. There is plenty of parking space and the host was very responsive. They left us a basket of snacks and a note of condolences which was an extra special touch. Highly recommend for anyone with a large group.

Group trip","We have family that lives in Cordele. When we converge on Cordele, we don’t have enough space in our own family Farm House. Being able to utilize Leon’s place as a home away from home, was just absolutely perfect! Our kids fished from the dock, we had great family, gatherings, played games from the game closet, enjoyed the outdoors, and it fits all of us comfortably! The game room was a bonus!
The house was spacious and clean, Leon left us snacks, and there was so much to do with the game room and outdoor spots. We will definitely utilize again!"
