Stayed a few nights",We loved this house. We were in town for a family wedding. This house was very spacious. The neighborhood was really nice. The house was very comfortable and easy to relax in. Mary was in touch with us until our arrival and made sure we were all checked in. If we had a question she responded right away. I recommend this place. We hope to stay here again on our next visit.

Stayed a few nights","Beautiful, and clean house on a quiet street.
Check-in was super easy.
Beds were not mattresses, but foam with mattress topper. Way too soft for anyone with back problems.
Kitchen was clean but difficult to cook in because of the lack of utensils and cookware
Overall we had a nice weekend"

Karim's Airbnb property exceeded our expectations! It was absolutely perfect for our dance competition weekend. The price was comparable to hotel rooms, and the driving distance was the same, but we got the added bonus of THREE bedrooms and TWO bathrooms, along with a full kitchen. This will definitely be our go-to accommodation every time we're in Rocky Mount! The house was super clean and beautifully maintained. Highly recommended!"

Like most have stated very clean, quiet neighborhood, 10mins from the main highway and restaurants , 5mins from the event center and downtown. Beds were a little on the firm side for me but we made it work and enjoyed our stay. I will book again if I were to return to Rocky Mount in the future. Thanks again!"

Stayed with kids","We came to Rocky Mount for Thanksgiving. My 85yo Mother in law lived 2 blocks away for 40 years before moving to Charlotte and we wanted her to feel at home instead of staying in a hotel. The house was fantastic! Extremely clean. There was one hiccup: The furnace stopped working on our 2nd night there, but Karim got on it right away! That can happen ANYWHERE. When we got home last night, our own furnace had crapped out and we can't get anyone to fix it until tomorrow. Karim had his back to cozy temps in no time! Thanks Karim! We hope to do it again next Thanksgiving!"

Stayed with kids","My family and I had an absolutely wonderful stay at this Airbnb in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. The beautiful decor of the place immediately caught my eye – it's evident that the hosts have put a lot of thought and effort into creating a warm and inviting atmosphere.
What truly sets this Airbnb apart, though, is its peaceful neighborhood. Nestled in a quiet area of town, it offered a much-needed escape from the hustle and bustle of big city life where I am from.
Overall, this Airbnb is a gem in Rocky Mount. If you're looking for a relaxing retreat with beautiful decor and a peaceful neighborhood, I highly recommend booking a stay here. It was a delightful experience, and I can't wait to return for another visit."

Stayed a few nights","A good Airbnb in a relatively quiet neighbourhood. Honestly, we were a little put off initially by the message from the host which listed numerous rules including not eating on the couch, warning us our reservation will be cancelled if we park too many cars, telling us the property is monitored 24/7 by security cameras and telling us ""this is not a hotel""! In case we hadn't got it the first time the rules were also printed out on the wall in the house with additional rules like ""no eating in bed"". That said, the property was actually fine and we had an OK stay!"

Stayed a few nights","The home was very clean, however someone else’s personal belongings were left in the master bathroom (not a big deal though). However the side door railing, which we were instructed to enter was loose and disconnected and one of the guest fell on the concrete outside. We were also questioned by someone who drove up the first day about why we were there and whether we knew the owner. We are all senior citizens and have no reason to be questioned. I did not report either incident to Karim because they did not return. I also didn’t report that one of the guest had a bad fall. But I am reporting now in the hope that the railing has been repaired. I’m sure Karim would have responded. I reserved two locations there were no problems on Cedarbrook."

Quiet neighborhood, and close to restaurants, grocery stores, and shopping.
Exceptionally clean, and you can tell Karim has taken pride in your home away from home.
The beds were so comfortable, Netflix was a plus, and the kitchen was equipped with the essentials for basic cooking.
We will be back next year. Top Notch!"

I wish we could have stayed more than one night! But we were just passing through. I highly recommend booking Jamie’s place. Jamie, thank you for having us! Your place felt like home."

Stayed one night","I had a wonderful stay at Jamie’s lovely apartment. It’s just as described, very comfortable, and has everything one would need for an overnight stay and for a longer one. As other reviewers have said, her notes were so helpful and thoughtful, something that many hosts don’t think to include. Jamie is immediately responsive, and she checked in with me to make sure I had everything I needed. I hope to stay there again."

Not only was the entire place charmingly decorated and super comfortable, Jamie was a wonderful and caring host. We wished we could've stayed longer! There were plenty of restaurants nearby and the neighborhood was peaceful and quiet. Jamie provided lots of thoughtful and useful little things that made the stay even better - our little one was a huge fan of the applesauce and instant oatmeal left for us. If we're ever in the area again, we'll definitely stay here!"

We were in town for a dance competition and Jamie’s place was perfect for our small family and it was only 10 mins from our venue. The attention to detail to think of everything her guests needs was tremendous! The apt is super clean and cozy. I would recommend Jamie and her apt to anyone!! Thanks for a great stay!

The space exudes warmth and comfort, filled with loving touches that transform it into more than just a place to stay – it's a place to live, even if just for a short while. The apartment was a treasure trove of delightful details. Every corner held a new discovery, from quaint decorative items to personal photographs that added a unique charm to the space. It's evident that a lot of thought and care has gone into making this apartment not just functional, but also inviting and homely. Organization and cleanliness were top-notch. Everything was in its place, which made it incredibly easy for us to settle in and find what we needed. The attention to detail was remarkable – from the neatly arranged kitchen to the perfectly fluffed cushions, every aspect of the apartment was meticulously maintained. The communicate was very smooth with Jamie. She rocks in my opinion for hosting Airbnb guests."

It was very homey and I felt safe. She even had it decorated for the holidays! The comfort of the primary suite was better than most - the bed comfort was excellent. I didn't use all the features offered as I was just basically sleeping one night and hitting the road early the next day. I think you will enjoy staying here.

The place has such a cozy feel and it was a great place to come back to each evening. Good decorations and peaceful spot in the neighborhood. Also, we even took the Roku remote on accident when we left the house and Jamie gave us a call and was so gracious about it (we swung back by and returned it to her, by the way).
About a week before our stay, I needed to extend our reservation by 1 day and Jamie confirmed quickly and had no problem.
We wholeheartedly recommend this Airbnb to anyone! Especially those who are looking for a homey, cozy feel in the little town of Rocky Mount, NC.
Thanks again!"

Stayed a few nights","Stop looking.
You've found it.
Whether you are visiting the area for friends and family for the weekend - or for a getaway (why I chose it), this place is peaceful and has all of the amenities that you need.
I chose it as a respite to do some writing, and it had all of the quiet I needed. the backyard is spacious and lovely to sit and read, and there are stores nearby in driving distance for your food and/or libation needs.
Jamie has thought of everything in regard to the notes of instructions that are left in the abode for you to know how everything works.
The hosts are very friendly and will engage with you as much or as little as your heart desires.
The place is probably (fit wise) compatible for two adults at max (and possibly a small child). (The coziness of the space would probably make it more challenging for three adults).
Stop reading this right now and go select this AirBnB.

Stayed with kids","This was our very FIRST Airbnb! All I can say is, why have we been wasting time with hotels? Jamie was wonderful. The apartment is directly adjacent to her home, which gave us a sense of security in case anything went wrong. The house is located in a nice neighborhood and I felt safe there with our 4 month old baby. The Airbnb was stocked with everything as described- and more! When we arrived we realized we hadn’t packed our sound machine (the only thing that helps our baby sleep), and to our surprise there was one plugged in and ready to go! It saved us from having to buy another one. Safe to say we will be rebooking with Jamie for our next trip to rocky mount. 11/10 reccomend !"

Upon driving up, the private back yard and garden called us to walk and sit after long hours of driving. The apartment was well acquainted with art, comfortable furnishings, and good lighting for reading and relaxing. Both quiet ceiling fans and lights greeted us with a warm and delightful feeling. Though there were TVs, we had books to read and rested well in a lovely en-suite bedroom. The kitchen had everything necessary for eating there, and we enjoyed our breakfasts before heading out for our days’ activities. We hope to return when we are in the area again."

Lots of pictures and paintings, nice decor and i love the sticky notes Jamie has all over the place with directions and instructions. Place was very quiet, unfortunately, we didnt get to enjoy the garden because we were in and out. There is a parking spot for you in the back of the house, super easy check in.

Jamie has thought of and added EVERYthing a visitor might need or want! She emailed every day to check if we needed anything, which we didn’t because she had already put it all there, right at hand. The bed was awesomely comfortable. The place was sparkling clean. The cost value was simply terrific. We would love to stay there again, and definitely will if we can think of any reason at all to go back to that area. Jamie was born to be an Airbnb hostess, and she is #1 in my opinion!"

Stayed a few nights","Excellent hosts! Everything was so nicely labeled with many notes inside of the rental to tell us how things worked and where things were located. Very convenient location for the volleyball tournaments. My only complaint is that the floors are extremely squeaky. So squeaky that they woke me up from sleeping as my daughter crept into the shared bathroom. The walls are also pretty thin, so we were able to hear the hosts in their home which is connected."

There were informative notes everywhere throughout the place indicating how to use all features. It was easily accessible to 95 with lots of options to get something to eat or anything else that you might want, easy to find, had a nice private driveway and parking. We couldn't have asked for a better place and we will definitely be coming back. Thank you Jamie!"

It was fun to run into the wonderful stories of her loved ones and the house as well as thoughtful labels as we moved around the space. While we didn’t need them, we thought the courtesy snacks were a step above and beyond. Jamie was also great at communicating with us while also giving us privacy.

The place has friendly pointers about its features and some of its history that adds character in a way that makes you smile. I received an email during my stay and needed to print and scan a contract. Jamie straightaway pointed me to a store only half a mile away that did that and also mailed boxes right here in town and got the job done before I was on the next stretch of my trip!

We only stayed the one night but I wish we could have stayed longer it put a smile on your face and made you feel happy. The host was quick to respond and had different snacks and food available for guests. They even had a map and journal showing were previous guests were from and what they said about their stay. It was definitely more of a homey, bed and breakfast like feel, so if you prefer something more hotel like this may not be for you. That being said I highly recommend it and would stay here again no doubt about it."

She always makes sure you’re accommodated to the fullest. Any time we are in town, we always try to book with her!!! You can’t and WILL NOT go wrong with booking their place!!!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a charming house that is located in a quiet, safe neighborhood. It is clean and nicely decorated. The photos are very accurate.
If you're looking for a place to bake cookies and drink wine, this is not the house for you! There are few cooking supplies and no wine glasses. Oh and you have to be a giant to reach the microwave! Hopefully you don't intend to lounge around the house here. The couch (that you should not eat on ) is not comfortable and the backyard...needs lots of work. There are no desks in the house. I found the dining room table and chairs to be a the best for telework.
This is a home to sleep and shower. Two full bathrooms and decent beds. TVs and ceiling fans in all three bedrooms. Never found a full length mirror but I did see an iron.
For the price, I'd recommend and do it again!"

Group trip","The house is as it is in photos. Nice home
, good area. Furniture was nice and beds we’re comfortable. However the lock was terrible. We kept getting stuck inside , often needed someone stronger to open the door. The knob was literally coming out the lock and had tape on it. The communication was not great and the host was a bit snarky as I discussed checkin issues with him. The property manager was dismissive of my checkin complaint. I’m not trying to tear this place up in the review but those are my only complaints. I felt the host could’ve took accountability of the agreement we clear as day made for early checkin but instead he commented on me being a host and suggested I should know about last minute bookings which I told
Him I’d simply let my guest know before they arrive ESPECIALLY when they tell me they have a 9am flight and booking is contingent on early checkin ! He took no accountability for not updating me."

Stayed a few nights","I booked both The Stowe Away and The Stowe Away II for a group of co-workers attending a workshop. Both properties were beautifully decorated, clean, and spacious. Some of the bedrooms were extremely roomy with seating areas. The pool and tiki area with BBQ grill were a definite plus! And there were numerous outdoor spaces for enjoying coffee/cocktails and conversation. Dorothy was very responsive when I had a question about our reservation...and she checked in via text to make sure everything was satisfactory. Overall, it exceeded my expectations...I would definitely recommend both properties!"

Stayed a few nights","Loved the stay at Stowe Away. There's a plethora of rooms to choose from and the kitchen was nice with lots of utensils, pots, pans, etc. However, be aware that the floors aren't completely level so there is a fall risk for those who may not be steady on their feet. It has the old timey cottage feel, and like a real old timey cottage the Wifi sucks. A great place to stay if you want to relax and take life slowly not so much if you want remote working conditions. Another thing to note is the pool area while great is a shared area so be aware other guests may show up and with the copious amounts of windows (which let in tons of light and are great to sit by) you may feel like you're in a fishbowl with the curtains open and guests in the pool area."

We came for our oldest grandson’s baseball tournament and the location was great. The grandkids ( ages 12-5) loved the pool! Dorothy and her husband were so responsive when we had a question. Highly recommend this house and if we are ever back for a baseball game, would definitely stay here!!"

Stayed with a pet","After visiting relatives all day it was nice to have a place that we could come back to in the evenings and relax in the quiet. Also, it was a huge plus that we were able to have our little dogs stay with us in the home. The home is nicely decorated, but could use some repairing. The tile in the bathrooms and decking around the pool area were not fully attached and/or secured. The home is not handicap friendly-lots of steps, and very low toilets and furniture, except for the king size bed. I tried to get into it and it was too high. I ended up sleeping in one of the smaller beds. Since it was February we could not use the pool, but it did look lovely outside. Lastly, it was nice to have the cold water and snacks as a welcome gift."

And although it was too cold for us to enjoy, the pool area was like something you’d see in Key West. The pool was really clean, even in January! Super convenient(5+mins) to I-95 and Rocky Mount(10+mins). And even though the other house connecting was empty, I’m sure things would have been fine sharing the pool area. Definitely a great Airbnb."

Stayed a few nights","The Stowe Away was a good stay. The two houses are attached so there were times when we heard the family in the other house. Also, it was a little awkward trying to navigate the shared pool with the other guests. It is important to travel with the right group of people as the layout of the house makes it so that you have to go through two of the bedrooms to get outdoors and the laundry room. The internet was kind of slow which impacted our ability to watch TV."

Great place to stay! We used both homes and could not have worked out better. Lots of great space. Both houses were impeccably clean and so beautifully decorated, accommodating, warm & cozy, with all the comforts of home (including snacks). We had everything we needed and MORE than expected. This place was Perfect for our group!
Love the open well stocked kitchen, the bedrooms are great (comfy beds). Everywhere you look you spot something new. Charming rooms to all hang together and yet roomy enough for everyone to have their own room to hang out. There are quaint areas for privacy, like a reading nook & private courtyard outside one of the of the bedrooms. Then there’s the outdoor space, it was so relaxing sitting by the pool everyday and great fun splashing in the pool with our dogs. In the evening we could enjoy each other's company at the tiki bar or go for a midnight swim. We had a great time and really appreciate the great service. Absolutely love this place.
Both Dorothy and Jerry were very friendly and personable attentive and responded quickly to any needs or questions right away and always happy to help!
Thank you, for not only sharing your lovely home, but for a memorable experience."

Getting to the pool was a bit odd as the only convenient way was through one of two bedrooms, but it was not a big deal for us. We will definitely book again next time we visit my brother.

The pictures simply don't do it justice. We marvelled at the design and decor during our stay... you spot something new and exciting almost every day. My parents were happy to have their very own reading nook, since my dad is an avid reader and this gave him a private area to read away from my two rambunctious boys lol. My mother loved getting acquainted with the large kitchen and the small, private courtyard outside of their bedroom. My children shared the large room with the wrap-around windows and it gave them a large area to play. My husband and I loved our room because we could sneak out after everyone was asleep and share each other's company at the tiki bar or go for a midnight swim. We were so sad to leave, but we are already talking about coming back again soon. This may be our annual family vacay spot going forward. Thank you, Dorothy, for not only providing a lovely home, but an outstanding experience as well."

There isn’t much around the house but there is food and grocery stores within a 5-10 minute drive. The house was being enough for our whole group comfortably. The pool and the tiki bar lounge area in the back was a great place to relax in between wedding activities. However, there were some cleanliness issues on the inside but it was minimal, there was also some on the patio but it may have been due to Hurricane Dorian which passed the day prior to our check-in. Overall, exactly what we needed!"

Stayed with kids","The Stoweaway was great for my family's weekend. We were in town for a graduation and reserved both properties. The convenience of having both properties made the experience worth it. The shared backyard with the pool was great for the kids. The house was clean and looked better in person than it did in the pictures. There were a few ants, but that is not an indication of the cleanliness of the house. It just so happened to be ant season. Any issue we had, Dorothy responded very quickly with a response and a solution. The rooms were spacious and comfortable."

Group trip","Great place to stay! Enough space for my whole family with some more room to spare. The only downside was the house needed some repairs that would have made the stay perfect! For instance, the beautiful bedroom doors leading to the pool were broken and had a big gap that let some outside bugs in and the outdoor area had some wasps, but I'm from up north so this is new to me. Other than that it was a great stay and I would definitely reccomend it to everyone!"

The house was perfect for our needs and sparkling clean. It is so inviting, you just feel at home. We can’t say enough good things about our stay there.

We walked in and the place had a nice scent and clean air, a spacious area with no clutter, and even a very attractive assortment of welcoming snacks. After a long day out, we were able to watch Hulu on a large flatscreen and cook dinner in. There was no noise from the house or cars the whole time and we never felt intruded upon. Will definitely stay again, probably the best AirBnB for the value in the county."

We all did agree that some of the rules were a bit excessive for the quality of house but all in all we enjoyed our stay and would consider returning in the future. I believe the wifi could use an upgrade since the TVs only had streaming services no cable. The two master bathroom’s were great with a jacuzzi in both. Good size house for the price!

We left a personal item and he was kind enough to send it back via mail for a fairly small charge. We found the kitchen to be lacking in overall essential items (utensils, plates, cookware, etc.) for the ability to host larger groups it needed more. Some good TLC is needed, but overall a wonderful host and good size place."

i am telling you about this, we stayed at AIRBNB for two days . my friends and I love this beautiful house. I love it. It was a nice quiet place . I suggest you need security light off and outside for the parking because of dark and hard to see on the sidewalk . also need toaster in the kitchen that all . Thanks for staying at airbnb .

Stayed a few nights","little things, the living room tv has a blue tint (thats not good for the eyes) the lights off the backporch were either blown or intentionally off.. shame bc the backyard seems to be inviting with the exception of those HUGE poodles next door JEESH!!! There really should be way more funiture in the home to accomodate large families. Please get rid of the stuffed parrott, It creeped us out the night we came back in. Also dishwashing fluid is helpful to keep the dishes clean and kept in between dishwasher loads. The bedrooms are huge but again the rooms could use some sitting furniture to avoid committing to the bed the whole visit. Beds are extremely comfortable we slept very well, love the area!! We would definitely reserve again! THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR FLEXIBILITY! YOU ARE A TRUE GENTLEMAN!"

Stayed with kids","George is a wonderful host. I'm glad his home was available. It was large enough for 10 of us to stay and sleep comfortably, from Sunday through Thursday. Upon arrival, the ambiance of the home is welcoming. The washer and dryer are located upstairs. As well as the King bed - bedroom w/ a beautiful full bathroom. If you're not comfortable with stairs, there's a Queen bed - bedroom on the main level w/ also a beautiful full bathroom. In addition there's a half bath on the main level. The layout worked out well for the family and my knees. We were interested in finding a home that our immediate family could stay in together, while we were in town for our son's funeral. This lovely home was the perfect fit for that. My husband and I are grateful for George and his home. We'll definitely use this home again if George will have us back and if it's available."

This house will sleep up to 6, but the dining and living areas will be a little tight for that many people if you want to spend considerable time in the house. The kitchen is complete with stove, refrigerator, and a small washer/dryer combo. There is no dishwasher. There is one full bathroom and another 3/4 bath. The 3/4 bath is tight, but manageable. We provided some feedback to the owner to improve the experience at this property. With that said, this property works well for short stays. The owner was responsive to all our contacts."

Stayed a few nights","Great location right off Sunset Avenue. As a Rocky Mount native staying for the holidays, it was helpful to be close to everything in reasonable driving distance, or even walking distance for a few things.
The house was comfortable, with enough space for my fiancé, sister, and I to stay in separate rooms, and to host my brother and his wife as well for a night.
The kitchen was decently equipped, which was a plus for us as we chose to cook.
Check in and out were remarkably easy, and the parking available was welcome as well.
Would recommend to anyone looking for a space to spend a few days, or a large group for a night or two."

Karim’s place did not have enough paper towels or toilet tissue, but once we contacted Karim, he had his cleaner come over the very next day to bring more tissue and paper towels. Unfortunately by that time we had already gone to the store to get paper towels and tissue. It was no biggie. I will still give this home an overall 5 star rating because the home was cozy, comfortable, peaceful, and Karim was very responsive to my messages."

Group trip","The owner of the home was very clear about their expectations. Extremely. However, the tone of their communication clearly indicates they've had issues in the past that they're attempting to address with clearer communication. My primary issue is that while they're clear, the guest is not treated as a guest but more of an inconvenience. It's clear they do not feel you are worthy to sleep in their home as you would your own.
This was in the initial email I received -
Important House Rules:
-NO MORE THAN 3 CARS OR YOUR RESERVATION WILL BE CANCELLED*
- DO NOT PARK ON THE NEIGHBORS SIDE
- PROPERTY IS MONITORED 24/7 VIA CAMS OUTSIDE
-NO SMOKING
-DO NOT BBQ IN THE BACK
- ****DO NOT EAT ON THE COUCHES! Crumbs get In between. Please do not do anything to the furniture that can cause stains!*******
These are not deal-breakers obviously but personally, I prefer property owners that are thankful for AirBNB'ers given the higher rental cost but I didn't get that vibe from this owner."

They were so potent that we had to open all the windows during our stay and we got headaches overnight."

Stayed with kids","We stayed in Rocky Mount, quite a bit both, in hotels and Airbnb. This property is historic and extremely well renovated and updated. Even though the house sits on a busy street, it’s peaceful and quiet. Parking is great as well.
The layout of the house is fairly open, if you like with a lot of window covering this probably isn’t for you can see right through the house . We enjoyed that, but my mother in law wasn’t too comfortable at night (she’s a bit old school about blinds and things).
The host has been extremely meticulous about instructions,, as well as leaving games and things for families to play with. Check out was extremely easy and effortless.
I would definitely stay at this place again the next time we come to town. This is a poster child for great AirBnBs!!!"

They excelled in their hospitality and we hope we get another opportunity to return. If you are in doubt of where to stay in Rocky Mount look no further!!! You will be glad you stayed with Greg.

Despite the ""transitional block"" we were two females traveling solo and we felt safe walking in the neighborhood and staying in this home.
It is very close to a fun hub of restaurants and breweries.
Greg was very responsive and helpful."

The Mill was in walking distance and included at least 5-7 breweries and multiple restaurants. We had top notch burgers at Barley and Burger (a 5 minute drive away). We walked over to the tipsy tomato for some awesome pizza. Had all different kinds of appetizers at Tap 1918. And amazing breakfast sandwiches at Books and Beans.

Stayed with kids","We travel to Rocky Mount every year for a dance competition. This was the first time we've had the chance to stay away from the highway & the hotels! We love The Mills & LOVED Greg's Airbnb. The house was super clean, had the cutest decor & amenities. 10/10 would recommend over any hotel, any day!
It was a bit loud in the master bedroom, because it sits on a somewhat busy road, and the houses surrounding Greg's are in a state of transition. But you can tell that if the area continues to follow Greg's lead - it will be the place to be in Rocky Mount!
My trip was with a friend of mine & our two young daughters, we felt very safe & very comfortable in this house. It's much larger than I expected. Modern decor with intact historical charm. Mistakenly told the other dance moms & will likely have to fight for this place next year :) Thank you Greg!"

Everything is decorated with wonderful taste. Absolutely spotless. Cannot think of a single thing we could have asked for to make the house itself better. Even the quality of linens was above expectations. If you are a light sleeper you should know it’s an active one way street - basically all night. Master window faces the street. Even so, I slept fine in the wonderful bed! Greg was quick to respond to questions! I will definitely stay here or one of his other properties next year if we come to Rocky Mount again!"

The house was very clean. We brought our food to cook and the kitchen was extremely well stocked for all the essentials. We also greatly appreciated the washer and dryer that was available.
There was a welcome book available with great recommendations on restaurants. We tried a few out (breweries in person and delivery for Mexican) that were great!
As another person noted, the house is in a transitional area of revitalization. I stayed there the first night with my three young girls. The following night my husband and was able to join us. I felt very safe in the house and area. Great access to the Highway, great food/breweries, and the event center.
When we are back in the area, we will without a doubt try and stay again in this rental."

I was especially impressed by the Welcome book and Coffee Bar! This house was Old and Charming with a Modern feel and little touches like multiple chargers, extra toiletries, a snack box and even a cute little waffle maker with pancakes and syrup.
I even got to spend some time sitting out on the front porch in the rocking chairs, which was Icing on my cake. Greg was a responsive and gracious host.

They were the perfect hosts and I would stay at any of their properties again if the opportunity presents itself. They left the most thoughtful touches and items and the home was very clean and inviting. Thank you Greg and family.

There was plenty of room for my family of 5 to sleep comfortably. Very quiet neighborhood, we were able to sleep without any disturbances. Love the decor in the home with lots of natural sunlight and plenty of space to move around. The host Mettu was very responsive and tended to all my needs.
