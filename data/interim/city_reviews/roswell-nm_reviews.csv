Stayed a few nights","The casita was the nicest Airbnb we have ever stayed in.
It was extremely clean and very comfortable.
That is very important to us since we have to visit annually for a medical consultation.
It is the best place to stay in Roswell hands down.
The fridge was even stocked with food.
Maria and Kim were very gracious and made us feel at home.
They live next door but the casita was cozy and private.
Maria was very responsive with any questions I would text her.
When our flight was canceled and we had to stay another 2 days they were very accommodating with allowing us to extend the stay.
The decor is very nice and there are impressive prints of paintings throughout the rooms.
We were blown away upon learning that several of them were created by Kim who is a professional artist.
We would love to stay here for our 2025 visit."

It is VERY clean, loved that I didn't feel like I needed to start by cleaning the space when we got there! I am plenty happy to pay for a cleaning fee when the space is this clean! Okay, now that I covered that! Wish we had more time just hanging out this cheerful casita! It was a quick over night stay but absolutely loved this space! The beds were comfortable, everything one needs is there and Maria adds lovely extra touches like snacks and some items if someone forgets their own! The decor and artwork is quite beautiful also! I have nothing but wonderful things to say about Maria and this cheerful space! Maria just feels like good people, very authentic and caring soul!"

Stayed a few nights","I recently had the pleasure of staying at Maria's lovely house through AirBNB and I must say that it was an amazing experience. The full size kitchen was a great feature, providing plenty of space to prepare meals during my stay.
The house was very inviting and comfortable, with a warm and welcoming atmosphere that made me feel right at home. I appreciated the special touches that Maria provided, such as having snacks available, wine and chocolate, and coffee pods.
The home was very clean and nicely stocked with extras such as dishes, towels, and cleaning supplies, which made my stay even more convenient and hassle-free. Everything was relatively new and in great working condition, which added to the overall sense of comfort and relaxation.
I would definitely recommend this AirBNB to friends and family, as it exceeded all of my expectations and provided a wonderful home away from home."

We we’re staying here on our honeymoon and our host left a congratulations note with a bottle of champagne and chocolates. What a wonderful surprise. We would definitely stay here again if we are in the area. It was so comfy and cozy. Thank you for helping us celebrate our wedding.

It's the best Airbnb I've ever been to.
Everything was excellent.
The place is beautiful, super clean, nice, private, with a beautiful view and patio.
I liked the location because you can walk to the back path and it has a beautiful landscape.
The place has everything you could need. From dishes and cooking utensils to personal hygiene products, first aid kit… (which was necessary because I cut off my hand cooking).
It really has everything, as if you were in your own home, we didn't need a single detail.
They also welcome you with a bottle of wine and snacks. 🥰🥰
They are very friendly people and made us feel really welcome.
We'll go again… 💖✨"

Stayed one night","The Bunk House was a terrific find for us on a short notice for one night and would definitely consider staying there more nights on another trip to NM. It was nicely decorated, and we felt at home immediately with plenty of room for two of us. It was clean, quiet, peaceful and dark! (You can turn off the lighted display on AC unit even) :) We slept great, and the space was perfect for what we needed. It was great she had a grill available for cooking, even though we didn't use it. Shower was amazing after a day spent hiking and walking around tourist sites: Stanton Fort, Lincoln NM and Three Rivers Petroglyphs ... it was clean with great pressure! Parking is off street and beside the rental, which is always a requirement for us. I left a sentimental piece of jewelry and she offered immediately to mail it to me, preventing us from back tracking miles to pick it up. Thank you, Jane for sharing this gem with us!"

Stayed one night","I cannot express how wonderful our one night stay at the Bunkhouse truly was. We were in town for a memorial service and being on the outskirts of town was peaceful, serene, and much needed. My mom and I stayed in the Bunkhouse and both felt right at home.
Jane was responsive, communicative, kind, and thoughtful. The history of the Bunkhouse was preserved but the comforts of home were very much so present; a beautiful melding of historical charm with modern amenities (plentiful outlets, lighting, overhead fan, tv, strong wifi, cell service, powerful split unit for heating/cooling, space heater, etc).
If you're looking for a getaway, some peaceful mornings with birds chirping and privacy while you sip your coffee and watch horses meander in the nearby field or perhaps a quiet evening by a warm fire out on the back patio...this is the place for you. All that said, it was VERY affordable.
Truly a gem of Roswell. Thank you, Jane!"

Clean, quiet and serene. Jane was so sweet and helpful. The horse greeted us upon arrival & is very friendly, he likes ear scratches ;)
There is no stove but there’s a microwave and fridge & Jane stocked it with some goodies. It was a little hard to find but Jane came out and pointed us in the right direction. The only recommendation i have is the toilet take a bit to flush so handle with care. Other than that I can’t wait to visit again ! Also highly recommend the cowboy cafe for breakfast :) thank you Jane for your awesome hospitality and for allowing us into your lovely and cozy home! See you again soon !"

Cute place, great amenities, and it's obvious that Jane takes a lot of pride and effort in providing a great experience for guests (and is more than willing to talk about the bunkhouse and its history if you want to know).
Location is out of the city, but it's super relaxing and quiet being nestled between a bunch of farms. And the stars....so many to see if you have a clear night.
Jane and her place are great, lots of little touches and amenities provided. I'd recommend this place, and if I'm ever around Roswell again, I'd definitely stay here."

Things to know that didn’t bother me (they were a selling point for me) but they might bother some:
1. It’s a cozy space and it would feel too tight for me if I was traveling with someone else.
2. The bathroom is tiny (too small for a sink) so if you travel with a lot of bathroom accessories, they are likely going to be in the kitchen
3. This one was perfect for me but others might be annoyed that it’s a few miles from any restaurants"

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed our stay at Kim's Airbnb and would gladly return. We had an issue with the fans and appreciated how quickly Kim responded & helped fix them. This location is central to all the Roswell sights, shops and restaurants. It was a quick drive to anywhere. We came to visit both Carlsbad Caverns and White Sands as well and found this location super in terms of drivability/something to do post-hike. We are both from the city, so the occasional emergency vehicle didn't phase us like it might others. This Airbnb had everything we needed, was comfortable, and in a super location. Thank you Kim :)"

Kim was so wonderful and more than accommodating when our plans changed last minute and needed an extra night’s stay. The super spacious bed and numerous cooking materials were a nice surprise. I couldn’t recommend this place more for a couple staying in Roswell!

Once we did get in touch with the host she was very apologetic and offered a comped stay in the future which was generous. This stay though wasn’t what we were hoping for after a day of driving. (Wasn’t sure the rating to give since there’s not one that aligns with the stay not happening)

Stayed a few nights","A unique location for an apartment, which suited me very well. Huge bed, well appointed kitchen, bathroom, and laundry. The wifi was strong enough for light-medium duty remote work. Plenty of entertainment on the TV. Walk 5-10min to delicious Stellar Coffee, UFO museum, Visitor's Center and more. Would be a little cautious roaming at night in the residential neighborhood behind the apartment, but get the sense that things generally stay quiet after dark. Street sounds are barely noticeable after six or seven PM. Just a passing vehicle from time to time. Good parking. Food option (til around 9pm) just a few doors away!
Kim was wonderful! Super helpful, and made my trip easy and comfortable while maintaining my privacy. Great spot, especially for such a reasonable price : )"

Since I'm a light sleeper, I brought ear plugs and doubled up with the white noise machine they provided, and I had zero issues with street noise. Kim was a friendly, responsive host and reached out to let me know the space ready for me early, which was very convenient. I'd definitely stay again if I'm back in the area."

The place is very clean and has all the amenities needed for a long or short stay. Just like with any rental for this period of time, there are going to be some small issues. Kim was quick to jump and fix the problems ASAP. She went out of her way to make I was comfortable. The house is located off of a busy road with lots of traffic (cars, trucks, semis, trains). It can get noisy at times but not enough to really complain about. Enjoyed my stay here and would rent again if back in the area."

Stayed a few nights","I think most options deserved an A++ rating. The value, the look, the location, and cleanliness were WAY better than expected. The look of space was better than expected. I must say that the vibe is very industrial and am very curious how the side “garden” will eventually look. I appreciated the space so much and knew that it was gonna be good but turned out way better. Very trendy and clean layout. The only problem I had was later explained by a local to be just be “a Roswell thing.” That was the WiFi! I jumped on my own hotspot about 80% of my stay because of how horrible the WiFi was. It was extremely inconvenient especially if you had work to do like I had. The location is perfect. I loved being around old mills. Parking was convenient. I had an problem starting my vehicle after check out, so I kept it in front for several hours and was not bothered about why I had not moved it after check out. I appreciate that. The motorcycles in the area didn’t bother me but it was there. It wasn’t put it in the description HOW CLOSE the location is to downtown and a “natural” grocery. So convenient."

Stayed with kids","Positives: My family and I stayed while passing through town. It was a lovely home and the Roswell theme was sure fun. It’s close to downtown and to the grocery store. We tried very hard to take good care of their spot. We thoroughly enjoyed use of the pans to make dinner. Loved the video game station they had set up for use, if people wanted to use it.
Challenges: Communication with the host. We couldn’t find an item that was needed. We also attempted several times to contact them about something that broke during our stay from normal use of moving it over. However, we could not reach them in the app or by phone, or get a response about how we could remedy the situation. We felt very bad about it, and tried hard to reach them. If you go here, a tip make sure you know the beds are mostly firm and bring your own extra pillows! Tons of decorative ones, few comfortable usable pillows! They do plan to get more!
Thanks for having us!"

His hotel was two miles from Burt’s house and my son could jog over to see us. We had a cozy and comfortable stay and took advantage of the great location to the downtown attractions and restaurants.
Also, the house was well equipped: lots of kitchen utensils, bathroom towels, blankets, etc. I also mentioned and gave five stars for the cleanliness of the house. The bathrooms and kitchen were immaculate."

Stayed with kids","I hate to not leave a 5 star review but there is one big issue with this house that I think has to be mentioned. Location. It’s in a bad part of town and we didn’t feel safe. Sure enough about 4am our truck alarm went off from an attempted break in. Luckily we were already on edge so my husband was out the door quick, gun in hand, to scare off criminals. I think the only remedy is a secure gate to park your vehicle behind, double deadbolts on doors, and outdoor security cameras. We felt like we couldn’t leave any valuables in the house and we were dreading someone would smash out a window on our vehicle or do further damage to get in. We didn’t sleep for the rest of the night.
The only other issue with the house is an extremely low counter in the main bathroom, I’m 5’4” and had to stoop over to wash my hands, and the raw edge overhang on the counter was too close to the toilet, scratching me twice.
Outside of those two things the house is nice. Most importantly the house is very clean, the beds are comfortable, the blackout curtains are a nice bonus and it is nicely furnished. We didn’t use the kitchen so I don’t know how well it is stocked. Burt was easy to communicate with and I would rent from him again if he had a house in a different location. I’m sincerely sorry I had to leave a 4 star review, Burt was truly wonderful, but as a renter this is info I would want to know."

Side note: We made a day trip to Carlsbad caverns but we lucked into some tickets for the tour. If you want to see the caverns then stay in Carlsbad for the night and get in line at 6am."

The only small drawback was some road noise could be heard from the two bedrooms with windows facing the road. It was manageable and only an issue with loud cars and/or honking cars."

The house was cozy, in a central location and had all the amenities to make a home style dinner. The back room was also very cool, as there was a vintage arcade game. The owners also let us in early which was nice. The only thing I would change is the furniture outside. The chairs could definitely be in better shape. Nonetheless, the big backyard was lovely.

When you opened the door to Carmen’s home, it felt like home! I was only in town for two days - less about site seeing and more about decompressing and recharging. This home offered a safe, sanctuary to unwind and enjoy the amenities. Our favorite were the pool table and indoor gas fireplace.
Carmen was absolutely lovely as well. She was communicative, answering all my questions promptly along with being flexible with check-in when I arrived to town earlier than expected. Carmen, thank you again."

There was plenty of space to have convos while one of us was cooking then move to the den to watch movies to end the day.

The cleanliness and attention to detail was the best I’ve seen in any AirBnB I’ve stayed in. White glove immaculate. Everything seems newly remodeled/redecorated, and the kitchen is SO BIG!

None quite living up to our own listing, but Carmen’s does! The entire house is adorable and very clean! The welcome snacks and drinks are perfect. The coffee station is so cute. We loved our stay and would definitely rent this place again."

Carmen even left us some nice movie snacks and sodas (to which our 9 year old son said ""5 stars!""). We really enjoyed the pool table as an added bonus. We appreciated the fact the house was dog-friendly and the backyard being fenced was nice to help keep the dogs contained. Carmen was super-responsive, accommodating and kind. If you're planning a stop in Roswell, this is a nice and convenient place for sure. We also recommend the Cowboy Cafe for a really good home cooked style breakfast."

Advantages:
Close to Main Street amenities
Newer Home
Very clean
Easy to find
Some condiments, coffee pods and water provided
Comfortable furniture & beds
Nice washer & dryer with cleaning pods provided
Outdoor grill
Big TV in living room
Disadvantages:
Some of the heat/air units didn’t function as expected.
The kitchen wasn’t very well stocked. We had to buy a baking dish to use. There were no baking sheets or tongs to use for the grill.
The barstools are too short for the bar.
The kitchen table with 2 chairs wasn’t ample enough for a home that sleeps up to 6.
There is no window covering on the master bedroom door to outside.
There were no extra blankets for the sofas or bedrooms.
No kitchen towels - only paper towels.
The outdoor furniture was small, uncomfortable and dirty."

Something to know though about the area- Roswell is not very EV friendly. If you are traveling in an electric vehicle do your research to make sure you have the correct adapters to charge in the town. There are VERY limited options until they build new chargers there.
Overall it was a great stay though and we loved Rebeccas rental!"

The kitchen was equipped with everything you would ever need....coffee pot, toaster, cooking utensils and baking sheets and pans. The bathroom was squeaky clean with wonderful shampoo, conditioner and body soap dispensers in the shower. The TV & WiFi worked perfectly! The bed was super comfortable with plenty of pillows. There were even soft comfy throws in the living room when you were watching TV. We plan to stay again. And the backyard was especially nice if you had a pet. The trees in the front yard were huge...probably 100 years old. This place was so relaxing and comfortable. We plan to stay again since we come to this area several times a year. Thank you Rebecca for being willing to rent out your beautiful home."

Don't miss walking over to the nearby MIA-POW Park to learn about some very interesting Roswell history! We had a great time and hope to come back!"

If we come back to this state again, would stay more days here at this place - didn’t have time to enjoy the backyard .
The only disappointment with Rebecca is that we didn’t get a chance to meet her. Besides being professional, she was friendly, something not all hosts can do .
Thanks again."

Roswell was a stop on a cross-country moving road trip, so unfortunately we didn't have much time to explore the area and only stayed one night at the property. Even so, we thought the location was fantastic, and it was the perfect place to relax and sleep in the midst of a grueling travel pace. Despite the heat outside, the AC was up to the task, and the additional fans in the guest room closets were also a welcome surprise! I highly recommend Rebecca's place and hope to visit again sometime soon, when we're not on a tight schedule."

Stocked kitchen with plenty of appliances, cutlery, pots, spice cabinet, coffee and teas, and even Tupperware to borrow while in the home for leftovers. The bathroom was not only clean but well stocked with big fluffy towels. Oh and the bedroom had the most luxurious bed...a California King...it was huge and now I want one for my own home. Thank you so much, Rebecca, for being such a wonderful host!"

We also spontaneously decided to visit the Roswell art museum which was super close too.. We were happy to realize we could just walk there, and the museum is really nice inside. We also enjoyed lunch at the Pecos Flavors Winery and Bistro. We definitely recommend it and they even had half sandwiches for lunch. We would definitely stay here again if we’re back in Roswell."

Stayed with kids","We absolutely loved this little house. It was clean, comfortable, and had everything we needed. We stayed here with our two little kids and my mom. Plenty of space for all of us without us feeling like we were on top of each other. Loved the yard for the kids to get out and stretch their little legs. The smart door makes getting in and out easy. My husband accidentally set off the alarm (his fault entirely) and the host was pleasant to deal with over our mistake. Lovely host!"

There isn't a dishwasher, but they provide a drying towel and soap and a brush if you choose to use the dishes (plus a pretty stocked kitchen, with spices and even pancake syrup). The bathroom was CLEAN. The entire place was clean. The backyard was perfect for our dogs to run around in and completely enclosed. There is a neighbor dog that barks, but only when you go outside and not when you're inside. Check-in was simple and the washer and dryer was definitely a plus!"

Easily played videos/movies on multiple devices while I caught up on office work. Felt safe running laps around the park across the street from the house. We didn't use the backyard, but did find an electrical outlet in the back of the house that i used to easily charge my PHEV overnight.
Such high value! Totally worth it."

The doggie treats on the shelf and wall pictures confused me as it states no pets but since I am a dog lover I appreciated the décor.
The park across the street was perfect for my morning walk and afternoon run, peaceful and with nice neighbors that waived and smile.
I would definitely stay at Michael's place again when in Roswell."

What an experience this was thanks to Gary and Arturo, co host you might say.
Anyone with an interest in US history/missile history/cold war/air force go! Go! What a shame the US did not keep one of these up and turn it into a national monument."

Stayed a few nights","Staying at the missile silo was an extraordinary experience! Gary and Ava welcomed us with such genuine warmth, making us feel instantly comfortable. Their captivating stories enriched our stay and made it truly memorable. Gary’s knowledge and life experience is the stuff of movies, and our chats were riveting.
The accommodations surpassed all our expectations. Turning a missile silo into a cozy and fascinating home showcases remarkable creativity and dedication. We loved exploring the space and contemplating its history. Looking back on the adventure that ended just hours ago, it seems completely incomprehensible that we were actually living inside a decommissioned Atlas nuclear missile silo. It’s kind of mind boggling.
We’ll be talking about this experience for the rest of our lives.
If you have the chance to stay here, don’t think twice: DO IT. We do a lot of unusual and eccentric world travel, and this is one of the most extraordinary experiences we’ve EVER had — by far."

It seems like it might be creepy to stay in a silo but it's actually quite homey, which is maybe odd in itself. Gary is a wonderful, engaging, and well-informed host, and Arturo's nighttime bonfire atop the silo is not to be missed. An amazing place to visit."

Stayed a few nights","This is without a doubt the most unique place you will ever call home, even temporarily. You will find yourself staying in a veritable museum with a man whose knowledge of this unique place is equally incredible. It's spacious, comes with amenities right down to food and beverages, and, in the bath, everything from toothbrushes to panty liners for the ladies. About the only thing you could need for your stay that isn't there is clothing! You could easily go into town and see all the sights, but why when you can explore a piece of this nation's history within steps of the room you'll be sleeping in? Plus, Gary is an expert on not only what you will find at this location, but at others like it, with first-hand knowledge of the entire history of the program that produced it. His enthusiasm for this place was only matched by my enthusiasm for being there. Will I be back? YOU BET! Many thanks to Gary and his assistant, Arturo, for the experience of a LIFETIME!"

The place is like a museum, but not fussy, just that there are tons of period-appropriate magazines, books, photos—you name it.
And it’s super close to Roswell so
You can dip in and out of there as desired.
We had an excellent 30 minute tour upon arrival which gave us some needed perspective on where we were staying.
But the whole experience from the history to the acoustics of the silo—all so cool!
Thanks Gary (and Raul) for doing such a pains-taking restoration of this important part of history!"

The accommodations, which were the old crew quarters, were fully upgraded, clean and cozy and filled with Cold War artifacts, photos, magazines, books, etc. We could have spent days looking at and reading everything. The tour of the silo itself was amazing. Looking down into the 11-story deep hole was vertigo inducing! The kitchen was FULLY stocked with a ton of food! We could not have been more pleased. I HIGHLY recommend this stay for any Cold War history buff! Our expectations were exceeded by far!!!"

Stayed one night","Gary's Atlas ""F"" missile silo 4 is a time capsule that preserves history, and allows us to experience through echoes what it was like to live in the new frightening nuclear era. The incredible speed and precision that this silo was built, operated and maintained was only matched by how swiftly it was dismantled and left forgotten. A treasure and a secret salute to all that made it possible for America's safe keeping. Thank you Gary for keeping this one alive and telling stories for many decades to come.
The new retrofitted living quarters are perfect for staying comfy while providing many artifacts of the missile silo and era, such a great opportunity. Raul, who guided us through the site was a great wealth of information and enjoyable to chat with.
It was a unique experience

Stayed one night","I have been wanting to to do this for a few years and this year decided I would treat my Son and Step Son to a Road Trip . We landed in Roswell, spent the day in town, then drove out to Gary's place. It was about 25 minutes out, very dark (as expected). I overshot the runway (road) by a few miles, reached out to Gary and he quickly got us squared away. I was super excited and my Son and Stepson has no idea where we were or why we were here. (LOL). Raul led us to the stairway and in we went. He gave us the grand tour and was very knowledgeable about everything including all the work Gary did to turn it into a BNB. The Silo was very cool, 186 ft down, we had a great time, and we went back to the Silo on our own a bit later for more photos. Next morning Gary came down to our humble abode and for the next 90 minutes we talked about the missile silo, how it can to be, how it became his, how it became his, Gary was an incredible host and our overnight stay was awesome!!!!"

It is such a gem and Raul made this stay even more special with his tour and in depth knowledge of the history behind the missile silo. Bunker is filled with magazines, books, and even movies that pertain to the Cold War era and it felt like we were in a time capsule. What an amazing trip for our family and we are extremely grateful that we got to stay here!"

Also Raul was a great host. The place was well stocked and I learned a ton of history.
But really the quality of the renovation and attention to detail was amazing. We all just felt super lucky to get to have this experience."

Stayed one night","Memorable stay in a missile silo!
So as to not repeat all the same great stuff everyone else said, couple notes:
-if you have kids or a couple people in your group, they have inflatable beds they can setup in the living room to accommodate everyone.
-they include a bunch of food/drinks in case you don’t want to go out/back to town, with a full kitchen. We didn’t take much advantage but felt it was a really nice touch.
-my wife was terrified when we got there (doesn’t do well either new situations like missile silos, ledges..) but Raul did a great job putting everyone at ease and giving us an orientation to the place.
-they really make you feel like home, allowing you to roam around the entire place, but Raul is just a quick phone/text away nextdoor if you need anything. Both he and Gary were super-responsive.
-there are DVDs in the bedroom. Go to the main menu of the one with the 3D glasses and look at the bonus footage featured in 3D.. a real “blast from the past”:)
-thanks again!!:)"

Stayed a few nights",Gary and Raul were excellent host. We had a very informative two night getaway in a piece of our local culture We were givin the opportunity to go to site 10 and go the depths of a once very powerful site. We made it half way down and so much is still in tact after all these years . The photos they have hanging through the halls in the living quarters show amazing detail of the sheer power involved in our country during the period and there is super nice living space. The biggest plus for us is the fact they are pet friendly so our fur babies got to experience this amazing vacation with us thanks again Gary and Raul for all that you have done and still do to make this possible!

We received a full tour on arrival, and with the kitchen fully stocked, there was no need to go into town for anything - just time to enjoy the place. We played our guitars in the silo (great acoustics), enjoyed a few board games, and taught our two boys about the Cold War. Raul will do whatever you need to be comfortable. Do yourself a favor and join the club if you can! PS - be sure to browse through the guest books."

We arrived after dark and missed our turn onto the land, but he was already waiting in his truck and led us right to the spot! And despite arriving later in the evening, he still took his time to tell us about the space and take us on a tour. We were encouraged to move around and explore freely during our stay, which made it feel extra exciting and fun. Just such a cool place and a once in a lifetime experience."

There was food, soda, so much literature, books, vintage magazines, and too much to list. We were given full run of the place. We watched the DVD's on the Atomic Age and had the most enjoyable experience. Raul was so gracious about us being at least an hour late on check-in. He was there waiting for us with a smile. 100% recommended. I hope to bring a couple of our kids someday."

I was surprised and delighted by the high level of comfort in the spacious, stylish, and sparklingly clean underground “apartment”, housed in the control center of the missile silo. Everything we needed was provided for, (bottled water, coffee & tea, even food & snacks!); and all appliances worked perfectly. Owner, Gary Baker, and property manager, Raul, were courteous, friendly, fun, and eager to share their deep knowledge about the history of the silos and the Atlas 5 missile program. The attached silo itself was exceedingly dramatic, photogenic, and creepy in a cool way. We were also given an extensive tour of another silo still in its slightly terrifying original unreclaimed state. Absolutely incredible. The whole stay was super fun, and a rare and unforgettable experience. Many thanks to Gary and Raul, for a fantastic time!!!"

Stayed one night",I absolutely loved the location. From the moment I booked too well after I left I have felt so overjoyed with happiness. The location was shockingly overwhelmingly beautiful. Please take advantage of the stars at night. The Silo itself was so beautiful and unique. It was a true honor to have been able to experience this important landmark in world history. Make no mistake that that is exactly what it is. It’s a moment trapped in time that seems so far in a mental reach but it’s just a Airbnb booking away. I’m glad this is open to the public to book. I wish I had more room to type I can go on forever. Please book for more than one night! I would have spent a month or more there. I have to talk about Raul! I’m so proud and happy of this person! He so knowledgeable and well spoken. The conversation we had made me so sad it ended. I learned so much. I have been introduced to a great new niche community. I feel like both Gary and Raul are historians. The love of history has spilled into me!

They gave us a tour of the place and told the story, plus we were also able to talk with Gary who shared some incredible anecdotes with us. After staying, we went to a museum in Roswell and saw the history of this type of military base and were even more shocked to have slept right there.

Stayed one night","Gary is a national treasure & our overnight stay in his missile silo was an unbelievable and unforgettable experience! Raul is also a gem & was an excellent host/guide for the ~24 hours we were there, frequently checking in to ensure that 1) we felt comfortable as if it were our home and 2) that we were enjoying our time in the silo to the max.
This was a birthday surprise for my boyfriend, who usually enjoys exploring these places more when they are totally abandoned, but he quickly realized this experience was unparalleled. Having the chance to dive deep into all kinds of interesting topics with Gary the following day, from missile silos to current nuclear affairs, brought history to life for us in a big way and genuinely felt like a once-in-a-lifetime hang session.
Even though we paid for it, we felt honored to have stayed here and to have connected with Gary & Raul. We would not hesitate to book this again - thank you both for helping me pull off the best birthday present EVER!"

There is a story here that is fascinating. Parts of the property have been painstakingly restored and reimagined while maintaining the original structures. The living quarters are charming, comfortable, and full of historic photography and a library curated by the owner who himself is a wealth of knowledge about the the first generation of ICBMs. This would be enjoyed and appreciated by history buffs and creative people alike. It is a memorable place that I feel privileged to have experienced."

But the real WIN is the Missile Room!!
When we got the tour, and Raul turned on the lights in the Missile Room for the first time, it was overwhelming – in the best of ways. In addition to hearing about the history and what the room (and the rest of the silo) would have looked like in original condition, we were able to spend time in the Missile Room by ourselves listening to music, drinking coffee, and enjoying a birthday cupcake.
Gary is an enthusiastic and informative host, and is readily available for any questions you might have.
This is a very unique experience that we will never forget! Thank you Gary and Raul!"

We were spoiled from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. The beds were very comfy, the bathroom spacious & clean, the kitchen was fully stocked with anything we might want plus loved cooking on the techie gizmos. The reading/sitting area was astounding to look at & many times I would just sit & stare at the books, the pictures and the decor and just let it all sink in. I personally loved the fans throughout as it brought me back to lazy summer days during my childhood. I’m so glad we stayed two days as we got to take advantage of an additional tour the next day. I think my biggest surprise was knowing we had full reign of the place to explore when we wanted to. Gary was very informative & Raul was a delight!"

Raul, the hardworking, talented handyman and artist, greeted us and brought our bags down to start the tour. Before continuing, we got to talk with Gary for a while about the fascinating history of the Atlas missile program, and how he became the Siloman! Gary is a truly interesting and knowledgeable man, with a heart of gold! His wife Ava has quite a beautiful personality as well! The whole family emits infectious positivity, despite the dark history of the place they call home.
While here, truly immerse yourself in the experience! Read some of the history from the books and magazines in his extensive collection, watch one of the atomic bomb history DVDs, go into the silo with just a flashlight and listen to the bats in silence, put yourself in the mindset of those who worked there.
Such a cool place to see and experience!"

Staying at Gary’s missile silo was that opportunity, and I’m so glad we did it. Gary’s preservation of this piece of history is clearly a labor of love and a public service. We appreciated his enthusiasm and his willingness to spend time sharing his knowledge. Raul gave a terrific tour of the silo (including the owls living in a ventilation shaft outside) and was so kind, patient, and informative. Both were very responsive and welcoming. The apartment had everything we needed, and the beds were comfortable. The historical photographs, magazines, and books were carefully chosen, and the thematic touches were thoughtful and appropriate.

The actual silo where the missile was once housed is so impressive. It's one of those things that you can only really grasp the vastness of in person. If you're thinking of booking this and hesitating, absolutely do it! The price tag might seem a little daunting, but Gary and his family do everything possible to make it worth it. It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience kind of stay. Join the silo club!"

If you have any interest in the cold war or military history, I'd imagine you'd find this beyond fascinating. In addition to staying at this missile silo and getting the grand tour, the next morning we got to visit his other nearby silo and tour that too. That one you can go all of the way to the bottom if you chose to do so.
Added perks - lots of interesting books and Life magazines from the cold war that are so interesting to look at.
The kitchen is stocked w frozen pizzas and other dinner items. There's plenty of breakfast. There was wine and beer.
They are very gracious and super knowledgable hosts. It was hard to commit to what was such an expensive stay, but I'm really glad I did!!!!"

Stayed with a pet","Gary’s silo was the most memorable and amazing place we’ve ever stayed! It’s not only a comfortable place to sleep, but also an interesting history lesson and a chance to see that history in person.
Even though the location is remote, the instructions to find it were clear and we found it easily. The location was secure and felt safe, and the view was beautiful in all directions.
When you arrive, Gary and Raul greet you and get you settled into the well-appointed apartment. The apartment is comfortable and has great photos, books, and DVDs related to the silo/missiles, as well as being thoughtfully stocked with food.
But the main attractions are learning the fascinating history of the ICBM program and silos from someone who is an expert, and seeing the silo. Gary is very knowledgeable and fun to talk to and learn from, and invites questions and discussion, and Raul gives you a great tour of the silo and the different features.
I highly recommend this experience- thank you Gary!"

The only reason Gary has 4.99 stars instead of 5 is because some fool doesn’t realize the INCREDIBLE FEAT that they don’t have to camp, they can actually have wifi, electricity, and running water in a formerly abandoned missile bunker.
The attention to detail for information you can study while there and the hospitality touches are amazing. 💯 recommend."

The accommodations are clean and comfortable. Everything is well (and redundantly) lit so getting around inside the silo is easy. (We stayed in the middle of a long road trip so the washer and dryer were really helpful.)
Be sure to check out the pictures scattered throughout the silo and the reading materials in the living area. There is some fascinating stuff in there!"

Stayed a few nights","We are going to be talking about this stay for years. It was such a unique experience. Gary is so passionate and clearly loves to share his deep knowledge of the early ICBM program. His stories set the scene and then Raul takes you on a tour of this amazingly unique place. Both of them make you feel right at home and encourage you to explore and enjoy the experience. We stayed two nights so also got to tour Gary’s other Missile silo (an exhilarating experience!)
We highly recommend this experience/stay. An earlier reviewer said if you’re considering it — just do it! We agree.
Highlights: morning coffee in the quiet, cool and oddly meditative silo. Talking to Gary after we arrived and learning the silo’s history. Perusing the books and old Life magazines (check out the pamphlet on surviving a nuclear bomb). Raul’s tours. The atomic bomb DVDs in the room. Stargazing at night. Walking around the fenced-in grounds after dawn. Tugging on the giant doors into the silo to feel the weight"

Stayed one night","This is a very unique experience. A once in a lifetime. A must for history buffs. Gary is an expert regarding the Atlas Missile program. He took the time to welcome us and make sure we were comfortable. He enlightened us about the US military and the general tenor of the time surrounding Cuban Missile Crisis. Raul was very friendly and helpful with a complete tour of the facility. Raul also offered to help with luggage and getting us acclimated.
This is not your normal glam Airbnb. The emphasis is on US history and the impact the missile program had on world history. Absolutely fascinating!
On a side note, take some munchies and maybe libations for fun. You are 20 minutes from Roswell and it’s not convenient to leave and come back. Also bring a sweatshirt or sweater, it’s a bit cool underground.
My husband and I were very much in awe of the site. Very thankful we experienced this. Gary and his wife have put so much into preserving this part of history."

Gary provided some wonderful history and interesting facts - it's clear that he is very knowledgable about silos! Finally, we had a BLAST playing music and singing in the silo. The silo is in the middle of nowhere, but to our surprise the kitchen was well stocked with water and a few other drinks as well as frozen and refrigerated food. Frozen pizza tastes so much better in a silo! Five million stars."

Stayed one night","This is not my typical AirBnb review, where comfort, cleanliness, and privacy are my priorities. That is not to say that this accommodation lacked in any of these departments. It is simply not the point of this AirBnb, which is better described as an experience than an accommodation. It is more akin to staying overnight in a museum, a place that is both contrived to evoke the feel of the past as much as it is actually the past. “Silo Man” Gary and his assistant are part of the experience, setting the place—a first generation ICBM silo and control bunker—within its historical context, the fearful Cold War era. Gary is a historian of the era and the engineering of Atlas missile launch silos and buildings, and is eloquently able to describe why this place matters, both to the past and to present day geopolitics. This place (and others like it) are so obviously the love and focus of his life, that it is hard not to want delve into their history."

We arrived and learned so much of the history of the silos and missile programs and received a tour. The living area was very comfortable and had so many awesome books, old manuals and emergency operation procedures, photography, and movies. We were allowed to explore freely throughout our stay which was one of the coolest parts! Seeing the silo in person was wild, I don't think pictures can do this place justice. The sheer size of being inside is incomparable to anything I've ever seen. We drove to the site from California and stopped in Pie Town, NM, on the way. This was cool because we got to eat our pie in an old missile silo which I never thought was something I would do in my life.
We are so grateful to have had this priceless, incredible opportunity. My only regret is that we didn't book a longer stay. We will definitely be coming back."

This is a once in a lifetime experience.
I incourage you stay more than one night.
He has other sites to take you to which can't be done in just one day.
Because the site is not in town, he goes out of his way to provide food, snacks and drinks should you be hungry while there or upon arrival.
His side kick Raul is just as pleasant and both want you to just enjoy the experience.

Raul, his assistant, also provided additional context and details as he gave us a tour of the silo. Two wonderful characters. The silo itself is striking - over a hundred feet deep into the ground, dry and well-lit. The massive blast doors are also amazing. Gary also has photographs, books, and other memorabilia to pursue. Living space was cozy and comfortable. Gary provided frozen dinners, knowing that we would arrive late, which was a nice added touch of hospitality.
If possible, arrive during sunlight hours. The directions provide are accurate, but it can be difficult to find at night. If you do arrive at night, give Gary a call and he’ll help you find the door.
Overall, an excellent experience! Good value for the price (which is admittedly quite high)."

Stayed one night","Like everyone else says... Don't think about it, just do it! Gary's 1st generation Atlas site is a sight to behold. Not only is the silo amazing, the accommodations and people are, too. When we arrived we proceeded to talk to Gary and Raul for 2 hours each and got a great tour. Gary took his time to give us his story, the silo's story, and a taste of the atomic age-- along with some great life and buisness advice that we took to heart! Raul is a joy to chat with and his story of what he did before this (and how he got his current role at the Silo) are awesome and worth listening to. These two both live the true American dream and believe in it for all of us!"

Stayed one night","It’s hard to say enough positive things about our experience with Gary at Silo 4! We echo everything that previous reviews stated about Gary, Raul, and the facilities!
You don’t always have a chance to interact with your Airbnb host, so what made this stay special was that we spent hours talking with Gary and Raul about history, silos, and plenty of other topics. We cannot thank them enough for their generosity with their time and knowledge!!
This was definitely an experience of a lifetime - as we wrapped up our discussion with Gary, he told us to “go play”! And he meant it! We were able to explore the grounds and the silo facilities as much as we wanted to!! And as to the regular “Airbnb stuff”, there was a well stocked kitchen (bring food to cook/eat - you won’t want to leave), coffee, WiFi, an escape hatch, nuclear history dvds, and a washer & dryer!
Stay with Gary - you won’t regret it!"

Stayed one night","DON’T hesitate- book it!! This was a unique and very special opportunity to literally spend the night in history. Gary, the host, was super friendly, easy to work with and extremely knowledgeable about the ICBM program. He gladly shared so much info about the program, our heads were spinning! The apt was clean, had EVERYTHING you could need and the pictures are spot on! The location was easy to find, and parking was plentiful. Our tour of the Missile silo by Raoul was excellent and informative and we were allowed to take all the photos we wanted. I really, REALLY need 5 more stars to give this experience!!"

Stayed with a pet","I've seen a lot of airBnB's. But this one takes the cake! what a phenomenal experience. Gary and Raoul are absolute dolls and made our experience 1000x better. You don't just get to stay and see you get to actually learn from the 1st generations hands on experience of these silos. This trip was mainly for my husband as a surprise birthday present but let me tell you, I would've went by myself too! If you've seen this listing on airbnb and thought ""Yeah maybe"", or ""that's seems pricy"" well you're wrong. Do it! You're not gonna get this chance anywhere else in the world and you don't wanna miss out on meeting Gary and Raoul!"
