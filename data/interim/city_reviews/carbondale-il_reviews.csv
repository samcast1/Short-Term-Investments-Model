Stayed a few nights","We come to this area frequently to visit family and always stay at Brenda’s if it is available. In the country with a big sky full of stars thanks to low ambient light. Lovely flowers, privacy, and there was a wild turkey outside the bedroom this morning. It’s a little tricky to find the first time, look for the brick colonnades at the driveway entrance. Drive straight past the big house and you are there. Once you have found it, no problems!! Perfect for the two of us!"

Stayed a few nights","Cute 1 bedroom with well appointed kitchen. King bed was comfortable. Bathroom was advertised as small, but it had all that you needed to be comfortable. The rural setting was beautiful and allowed walking and a bit of nature after a long drive. Easy to find, but arrived before dark. Town was about 5 miles away, so the best of everything."

Stayed with a pet","Place was fairly clean and cute. Loved being able to bring my dog, walk around the property, and still felt very secluded despite having to drive past main home to get to ""apartment"" which is more like a barndominium. Bed was so comfortable we're buying the same mattress to replace ours.
The place wasn't pristine (dirty microwave, a few ants in the bathroom but we stayed the first nice weekend of spring so that was not a shocker) but overall clean and comfortable. If you're sensitive to smells, you can tell pets have stayed there but overall wasn't bad, we got used to it.
For price, this place was a good value, great location near hiking trails and the wine trail, and would definitely stay again."

Stayed with a pet","My family had a wonderful stay at Brenda's Carbondale home! Perfect for two! Brenda's is close to town, beautiful trails, and SIU! We loved the private property and amenities of the house. The only thing I couldn't find were measuring cups and a coffee pot, there was a Krueig but we opted to use our pour-over. Access to her rental was easy, and Brenda allowed us to settle in before checking in to see if we needed anything. Although we didn't meet, she was very accommodating and friendly! The quiet and peaceful landscape was the perfect getaway; don't forget to look up outside at night; the stars are gorgeous! Thank you, Brenda!"

Stayed a few nights","We had a very lovely stay at Brenda's place. The kitchen was very well furnished, and the huge bed very comfortable. The outdoor patio is right next to the studio and a perfect place from which to enjoy the stunning surroundings. The wide windows in the living room and the bedroom also allow to enjoy the peaceful landscape and the pond/lake from inside. The property is vast and we only walked down to the pond/lake but there is much more to explore. Another positive aspect: it is a short drive from beautiful trails in the Shawnee Forest. The bathroom is indeed small but with a nice shower. Easy to work on the kitchen counter or to enjoy a movie from the couch. It was a perfect pick for us and a very good price for what the place offers."

Stayed a few nights","The location was in the middle of everything we needed. It is on the older side so when we woke up, it was like we had allergies, but went away as the day went on. Would recommend to bring earplugs as the air conditioner in the room was pretty loud. The description of the bathroom was very accurate as it was very small so we utilized the kitchen counter to get ready in the morning. We didn’t need to spend much time there but the property itself was beautiful and peaceful. It was a great deal!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a great little place especially for 2 people. The bed is big and comfortable and the whole place was very clean. Full kitchen with all the necessities. As it is described in the listing, the bathroom is tiny but the hot water is hot and the water pressure is good so it was perfect for everything we needed a bathroom for. I especially enjoyed sitting at the outdoor ""gazebo"" area drinking my coffee in the morning or a beer in the evening and listening to the bullfrog serenade coming from the pond. Very quiet and peaceful location. Easy check in and entry. I understand some people have had trouble finding this place when they first arrive, but before we arrived I looked up the address on (rhymes with) Oogle Street View which showed the mailbox across the street. I just flipped Street View 180° and it showed me the driveway from the street so I knew exactly what I was looking for and had no problem at all. We will definitely look to stay here again."

Stayed about a week","Brenda was extremely responsive. I stayed at her place twice for approximately a week each time. Both times minor things happened (i.e. lights went out in bathroom, flipped a breaker, etc.). She not only responded quickly, but had the things fixed in record time. I was on a third shift schedule, so peace and quiet was important. I never had a problem falling/staying asleep. The wifi is good for streaming videos and doing online work. The location is in close proximity to restaurants and shopping. The apartment was over all clean (dusted, wiped down, linens washed, etc.), but is due for a deep clean. Had I only been staying for a few days I don't think I would have noticed anything, but being there a week you start to notice dust build up in the areas that don't typically get cleaned on a weekly basis in any home. I 100% recommend Brenda's place. I cannot put enough emphasis on the kindness and response time of the hosts!"

Stayed a few nights","Wonderful! I have stayed in many Airbnb’s, and I’ve never had a bad experience. But this is the ONLY one I’ve loved so much that I had to return for a second visit. The living space is comfortable and cozy, with many small touches that show what a thoughtful host Brenda is! The kitchen has all you need to prepare any meal, and I’m impressed by the great quality of all the cooking utensils, pans, appliances, etc.
The king bed and pull out couch are really comfortable. The friend who came with me loved the bed mattress so much that she ordered one for herself when she got home!
The outdoor covered patio overlooking the pond is just lovely, and I spent much of my time out there watching deer, great blue herons, and all the wildlife a pond attracts. And the view for star gazing is amazing!
Although it’s only minutes from Carbondale, you’d never know it in this quiet setting. Also, it’s only minutes from Giant City State Park, and many other beautiful hiking and fishing spots.
Brenda is a great host, answering messages quickly and taking care of any need I had.
I can’t recommend this place highly enough. I WILL be back for the third time as soon as I can!"

Having a washer and dryer was so excellent. It was great being able to travel home with all clean clothes. My kids really enjoyed exploring around the pond and catching fireflies at dusk. The owners were quick to respond to any questions or needs we had and were very kind and friendly; checking in during the week to see how we were and if we needed anything. This was my first experience with an Air BNB and I am so happy it was a pleasant one. Thank you Brenda and Doug for giving us a little home away from home.

Stayed a few nights","HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
We enjoyed our stay here SO much. Inside, the kitchen was well stocked with quality cookware, utensils, and appliances. All the shelves and cabinets were labeled with their contents, which made finding things so much easier. The bathroom is small but clean. The king bed is very comfortable. (We didn’t use the pull out couch bed.) Lots of closet room and dressers for our stuff. Many small, tasteful touches throughout the apartment.
Being a nature lover, I particularly enjoyed the outdoor areas. The patio overlooking the pond is lovely, comfortable seating surrounded by well tended flowers and shrubs. Two bird feeders hang near the house, and I enjoyed watching all the activity there, as well as the herons and turkeys at the pond. The grounds are so well maintained, making it easy to stroll the entire property. We are hikers, and we were only about 10 minutes away from the trails at Giant City S.P., which was perfect. But, we were also only minutes away from shops and restaurants in Carbondale. The best of both worlds!
Brenda and her husband were gracious and helpful, and I look forward to staying here again!"

Stayed a few nights","Hello Travelers! This is a cute, minimalist and cozy space. This is perfect for those looking to explore Carbondale city from a quieter perspective, for those looking to spend time exploring Giant City, and a beautiful beginning for a drive out to explore Garden of the Gods. The property is beautiful with full views of the pond, land, and a cute outdoor sitting area. Belle, the pooch, is super friendly and will come visit you when she does her rounds. At night around dusk, watch out the windows next to the bedroom door! We saw so many deer running around at dusk. it was perfect. You can bring a telescope! the views are great.
This would be a great location for those wanting to make it to any fests Makanda and Carbondale are hosting. Don't forget to take a break from cooking and check out the Long Branch Cafe in Carbondale (and you may find some treasures if your vintage clothing hunting at Vintage Tropicana, just past Long Branch's parking lot - you can't miss it! there are traffic signs indicating when they're open - just call them about their shop).
Enjoy Boskydell road!"

My son and I camped in the back yard and enjoyed listening to the frogs and crickets (and a few coyotes) while looking at the stars, while my wife and daughter took the bedroom. Everyone was well rested. The house is a great jumping off point for hikes and exploration around Giant City."

Brenda also suggested Hunans Chinese Restaurant for dinner. Another not to be miseds place. She was right, the best Chinese we had ever had. So fresh.
So if you are looking for a beautiful and quiet place to stay in Carbondale, look no more. A little piece of heaven on earth. Thank you again, Brenda, for everything."

The kitchen was fully stocked with anything you would need to cook a delicious meal from scratch - pots, pans, cutting boards, cooking utensils, a coffee maker and even and air fryer!! Brenda also was very respectful of our concerns with covid and the apartment was absolutely sparkling clean on arrival. This apartment is also within 45 mins of Little Grand Canyon, a must-visit for any adventurers! If you’re looking for a quiet place to relax at night, whether you’re hiking all day or wine-tasting all day, this is the perfect spot."

It is so peaceful and quiet, perfect for relaxing and getting away from busy life for a while. We visited the Blue Sky Vineyard (it was fun even in the freezing cold of February) and we went for a walk at Fern Cliff State Park. This place was perfect for our dog because the porch has a gate allowing him to run around outside without getting out. We want to come back and visit more of the local wineries. We stayed for my birthday weekend and I briefly mentioned that in conversation with Derick when I reserved the treehouse. When we checked in, there was a big Happy Birthday banner and it was so sweet! It made the weekend feel more special and I appreciate the thoughtful detail from the host."

Stayed a few nights","Lovely tree house in near the wilderness. Had listed amenities and provided additional information on local places. We walked to the Blue Sky winery nearby to get a better sense of the peaceful area even in the winter time.
The tree house has hot water and heating although would recommend reading instructions to make sure you're not too hot when sleeping upstairs or freezing in the bathroom. Kitchen is great to cook in, peaceful scenery and thoughtful touches. No WiFi, so if you primarily rely on WiFi calling or navigation please download maps beforehand. Otherwise a very tranquil stay for the wintertime to escape city life."

Derrick was awesome to work with and the pictures do not do it justice. For size of home there was way more little touches that I have had lacking in much larger spaces. Derrick has thought of everything ! If you have dog to travel with you need to rent this place now!! Absolutely perfect for the pups and worry free for owners.

This was our first stay, but we will not hesitate to book a return trip. We didn't have a need to use the indoor fireplace, but found solace at the outdoor fire pit.
Derick is receptive and knowledgeable of the area and what guests would need and want during their stay. The place was well equipped with both.
Take your supplies so that you don't have to leave.
I would recommend this property to anyone looking to unplug."

Stayed a few nights","Dericks treehouse was absolutely amazing! The inside of the treehouse was immaculately done. We loved the decor. It was modern with a rustic feel. We felt at home as soon as we entered the treehouse. It was a little hard to find because we arrived at night and it was DARK! It’s not exactly where the pin shows on maps, but about 1/4 mile away. No big deal, after a little driving we found it no problem. We love how much there was to do so close by! We enjoyed hiking the panthers den loop, checking out the wineries with live music, and finally the best brunch I’ve had in a loooong time at Fork and Vine. We visited the cute boardwalk of Makanda for ice cream and even checked out the Goreville food market. The little towns were like stepping back in time.
We spent most of the time enjoying the beautiful weather on the wrap around porch. It was such a nice getaway from the city. We truly enjoyed every moment!"

We LOVED the remote location. 2 wineries less than a 5 min drive away but no other stores, gas stations, places to eat less than 15 mins away. The area has absolutely zero cell service once you get off the highway. Derick said this and we were expecting it and enjoyed it.

We would stay again in a heartbeat, and we recommend anyone to do so, as well.
Thank you, Derick, for a wonderful stay!

Stayed with kids","The treehouse was everything we wanted and more for our first mother-son adventure! My 7 year old and I wanted to get away from the city and do some hiking in the area. We were also looking for a place that would be away from other people, peaceful, and adventurous while still providing enough home-like comforts for a somewhat picky child. The treehouse was all of that and more. We were especially thankful for the firepit and s'mores as they helped us create memories. The hot/cold water dispenser with filtered water was definitely a bonus for us as we filled our hiking packs every time we left for a hike. I loved the added touch of freshly roasted coffee. (It went well with my French press I brought!) Sitting on the porch in the early morning with fresh coffee and a book while the hummingbirds buzzed around me was a type of peace I won't soon forget! I think the treehouse would make the perfect getaway for anyone looking for peace and a bit of adventure."

We loved sitting outside and listening to the forest, there were a ton of hummingbirds hanging out around the house that were so much fun to watch. The house itself is clean, well kept, and well stocked.
One thing you should be aware of: no wifi, no cable, and we barely had cell phone signal (had to stand in certain places in the house/outside to send a text, DEFINITELY no internet surfing!) Not a problem for us, it was really nice to be away from everything. Just know what you’re signing up for and plan accordingly.

Stayed a few nights","Derick's place was the perfect spot for our Shawnee National Forest adventure.
After looking through many listings, we decided that its secluded location in the forest would be a perfect spot for a getaway. With the beautiful wildlife, the courtesy s'mores kit and the kitschy movie collection, we barely touched our phones. And we found that just driving a mile or so down the road was good enough to get the cell service we needed to make a few quick calls to family back home.
At the cabin, we were able to cook great meals, rest after long days of hiking, and most of all enjoy the scenery from the porch and even the 2nd story outlook. (Our favorite part was waking up to the hummingbirds buzzing at the feeder right outside our windows.)
We also enjoyed going to Feather Hills Vineyard and the Blue Sky Vineyard. They were both close to the cabin. Both great spots for wine tastings... and for being around some friendly vacationers and their dogs too."

Second, I have to say how beautifully and thoughtfully this place is put together, down to the smallest of details. Every time we realized that we'd forgotten something, or wished we'd brought, we could just open a drawer or cabinet and there it was!
I mean literally anything you could think of.
Host left us freshly roasted (delicious) coffee and didn't hesitate, when we ran out needed more to hook us up.
It was such a special time for us, to just BE without distraction.
My husband has ordaned that the Tree House is officially our NEW Anniversary destination, (you've been warned Derrick, we're coming back!)

Although near a local road, there was extremely little traffic (i.e., maybe a car or two an hour). The vast majority of sounds we heard was from the local bird population.
The Tree House had the basic necessities for a comfortable stay. Derrick even provided a smores package for those wanting to take advantage of the fire pit. The Tree House had all kinds of little quirky details demonstrating the thoughtfulness put into making the space welcoming and inviting. It was a fun place to stay.
The Tree House was a great launch location to see parts of southern Illinois, which has a lot to offer. We did some of trails and had a breakfast at the Giant City State Park near by. We also checked out some of Cache River wetlands areas in addition to the Pomona Natural Bridge in the Shawnee National Forest. Lots of adventures available in the area."

A true dog lover designed that enclosed porch…it was awesome. And the outside shower was surprisingly relaxing. We thoroughly enjoyed our time at the treehouse. We would love to visit again!

Stayed with a pet","Derick's description of the property was spot-on, and the location was perfect for us. Derick's recommendations (on the website) were informative and helpful. (Unfortunately, the E-Town Fish Restaurant had floated 100 ft into the Ohio River, so that's currently a no-go!)
Many wonderful hiking destinations within an hour's drive (Panther's Den trailhead is less than a mile up the road, Ferne Clyffe 15 minute drive, and many others).
Two wineries within a few miles of the house, and others nearby.
Derick owns the forest land behind the house, so you can get in some fun hiking right out the door. Very quiet and peaceful.
The house is compact, but well thought out, and fit our needs nicely.
The furniture, kitchen equipment, etc. were in excellent shape; everything was very clean and functional. The surrounding outdoor deck was wonderful. Small pets and mobility-compromised people may have trouble negotiating the spiral staircase, so check with Derick before booking if you're concerned."

Stayed with a pet","A very cozy cottage looking over hilly woods and a creek. Very secluded and private. Nicely stocked kitchen and easily controlled fans and heater, as well as a gas fireplace. Everything was great, but I didn't realize how steep the spiral staircase was going to the sleeping mezzanine. No way I wanted to go done them in the middle of the night to uses the bathroom. Plus, no way that a dog could or would climb them. I chose to sleep downstairs with the dogs (this place is extremely pet-friendly), near the the fireplace and bathroom. Sleeps three or more, three upstairs, and possibly two downstairs on a reasonably comfortable convertable couch. Overall, a super weekend retreat. Oh also--zero phone or wifi reception, but it states that clearly in the listing."

Although you you’ll have little cell reception, you won’t miss the electronics due to being so distracted by the beautiful setting and shear greatness of staying in a treehouse! Super clean and cozy place perfect for a romantic getaway or even small friend trip. We didn’t bring our two dogs, but they would have enjoyed it too with the gated porch and provided doggie bowls. I’ll definitely be staying here again in the future!"

He was extremely helpful with recommendations for where to eat and hike.
It was pristine and peaceful . . . with very comfortable beds, perfect kitchen, cozy seating area by the fire, lovely deck where the dog was safe and close to all that we wanted to see in the area!
We really appreciated the details and thoughtfulness that Derick added to his place ----from the freshly ground coffee, the hot/cold water dispenser, bathroom products to the dog bowls provided.
We would definitely return ----the only down side was that we wanted to stay longer----it was hard to leave."

Only down fall for us was that we missed watching movies together in the evenings, however we did play several rounds of Yahtzee which was a lot of fun!

Stayed one night","We would 100% recommend Dericks place!!
Great location, very secluded in the woods. If there were any neighbors, we sure couldn’t see or hear them. Just fyi, the windows do NOT have curtains or shades, which was a little uncomfortable for us because we’re used to closing the blinds every night at our own house for comfort.
The house was very well stocked, with extra gifts such as a s’mores kit and coffee/hot chocolate. The kitchen was stocked with everything you need if you enjoy cooking like we do! He even had a full rack of spices. Derick was very quick to respond and gave us suggestions for local places to eat as well.
There was no cellphone service or WiFi and the tv was small (placed about 9ft off the ground) if you want that for entertainment. It has some local channels but there is also a way to play dvds if you bring your own dvd to watch! We weren’t much for tv, so that didn’t bother us too much. Everything else was wonderful and he even provides some games to play as well!"

Surrounded by nature, but in a very cozy, well-appointed, intimate cabin that had great attention to detail when it came to both physical space (e.g., the convenience of a full set of light controls on main AND loft levels) and amenities big & small (hot/cold filtered water machine AND a meat thermometer). Not to mention the fabulous (and freshly roasted) coffee. Getting out of the hustle & bustle of St. Louis to kick off 2023 was exactly the restorative weekend we needed (can't remember the last time I read 2 books in 2 days); and the atypical 60 degree weather was an extra special bonus. Couldn't believe we got to enjoy the porch in January! We will definitely spread the word about your beautiful place, Derick!"

I’ve already recommended this place to all my friends, we’ll definitely be back!
Our host Derick was so helpful and offered to help us with anything we needed when the snow/ice started. He left us roasted coffee and a bottle of wine! He responded immediately to all my questions. His customer service is top notch! 10/10

Stayed a few nights","Feel free to read the other reviews, as I share our Homestead Cottage holiday (Thanksgiving '23) experience. Chris accommodated our evening arrival with the porch light assisting our check-in. Our timing & the rural setting, especially in light of the shotgun hunting season, offered plenty of nature sightings. Chris' thoughtfulness includes a flashlight to offset insects' instinctual lure of a porch light. The self check-in was a much welcomed blessing.
This all electric Cottage (no CO source) employs a tankless hot water heater, which is simple with little adjustment from common tanks. It's cozy & energy efficient in spite of the fall-winter temperatures. The range & stove are apartment sized (24""), so no Cottage baking (a good thing from my perspective). Chris' Homestead Cottage truly made our first Holiday rental simple and affordable - please pass along our thanks to your support crew, Chris."

Stayed with kids","Chris's place was perfect for our small group (2 kids, 2 adults). It had everything we needed as far as towels, kitchen utensils and towels, blankets. My son and I slept on the futon type bed and discovered it is way more comfortable if you sleep with your head towards the front door. (My 5 yr old can sleep anywhere so that was more for my comfort) There is a floorboard heater in the bedroom that we somehow missed the first night, and since we were there on a verrryyy cold weekend, it felt great the second night. There's another heater/AC in the main living area that worked perfectly as well. We enjoyed looking at and petting the horses and goats...they were all friendly and curious and just adorable. I would chat with Chris before doing anything on your own bc the fences can be live and she will tell you about each horses personality, etc.
The area is very close to the downtown on Carbondale, which had some great dining spots. Our kids LOVED the Boo Park too!"

Chris, the host is very nice and gives good recommendations on where to get the best burger or cup of coffee in town. the cottage itself is very clean and has all the amenities a traveler might want or need. make sure you take time to sit out on the porch with a cup of coffee or tea. you can watch the horses and chickens and relax. my son and his girlfriend are students at SIU and I always try and stay here when I'm in town visiting."

The kitchen is fully stocked even has fresh eggs from their farm. The bed is super comfy and the space is like home. Everything there was perfect. Lots of games to play at night. You'll love the sweetest dog to come say hello when she sees you. The serenity of this country getaway feel is flawless. Excellent communication, easy to check in and check out. Great local for the wine tour of the vineyards and many other things to do in the area. Book now before you cannot! If I return to the area again, I will seek Chris's cottage as my go to place! You want to stay here!"

The cottage is well removed from the main house and the grounds had numerous trees so it felt as if we had the farm to ourself. One evening we watched two deer from the front porch. The accommodations were clean, well maintained and appropriately decorated with a country chic decor. The kitchen was well stocked with condiments for cooking, snacks, chilled water and even farm fresh eggs. This was truly a delightful experience."

Stayed a few nights","The property and little house are gorgeous. The house is small but brilliantly designed to make the most of the space. It is plenty for 2 people and would probably be ok for 3 as well. All the amenities were good and the heater worked well on a cold night. It is on a big property - looks like maybe 5 acres or so? Anyway, the main house and the barn were decorated with Christmas lights that make for a breathtaking drive-up to the property. As for location - it feels like it is in the middle of nowhere, but is only a few minutes from the college and city center. It is very quiet in a country kind-of-way. It is a great monetary value. The only little problem we had was with the dogs standing outside our car growling and barking on the second night, but that was resolved without incident."

You’re just down the road from the tasty Midland Inn (make sure to get a margarita), a few minutes from campus and the best pizza in town at Quatro’s, and only 15 minutes from the beautiful trails at Giant City State Park.

We saw so many deer and at night too many stars to count (also witness the rare northern lights event in southern Illinois!). Waking up and sitting on the rocking chairs, drinking coffee and watching the sunrise was the most peaceful. The cabin itself was immaculate, almost as if everything was brand new! The bed was beyond dreamy and comfortable, even the pull out sleep sofa was comfy - we all slept very soundly. The kitchen had everything we needed, and we did cook large meals. The hot tub is better than most with the jets actually powerful enough to feel like a light massage. The bathroom was spotless and having access to a washer dryer was neat, after the hot tub we would dry off our suits before the next dip. We definitely will be back, it was a much needed retreat from graduation madness. Thank you so much!"

Bathroom and bedroom are very tasteful and highly functional. 4-5 miles from Giant City state park. 5-6 miles from Kroger in Carbondale. 30 minutes from Marion. 1 hour to Cape Girardeau, MO makes these an supremely well located cabin. Access into the area is easy and is partially paved and gravel. Entry in the home was simple. WiFi worked well.
I loved everything about this cabin. I hope I can stay here again."

The cabin was nicely secluded and we could tell these were built as a labor of love. The cabin had everything you could need while away, and the caldera salt hot tub was a great way to end a day of hiking. We can’t wait to return again to stay in a different cabin and explore more of the area."

The cabin is new and the interior finishes are immaculate with an at home feel that captures the outdoors with a touch of modern. Nothing against some of the more quaint locations available but this place is a more updated spin on the traditional cabin.

Getting in is super easy - the locks work very fast. The washer and dryer are very fast cycles, so you won't have to wait long. It's an A-frame, so watch your head, basketball players. The neighborhood is older but super friendly. Many of the neighbors waved to me coming and going. Lua is an excellent communicator and super responsive. I did not begin to use all of the amenities in this cottage. Oh, the beds are super comfortable, unless you prefer sleeping on boulders, LOL. I slept better than I have in years."

Stayed a few nights","Lia was an exceptional host! I use Airbnb a lot but I don’t usually leave a lot of reviews; this one deserved a review.
The place was beautiful, peaceful, and the private backyard was absolutely amazing. Lia was very responsive and went the extra mile when it came to service. We accidentally left our winter coats hanging behind the door (it was cold when we arrived and like spring when we left) and she mailed them to us the next day.
The location is great for visiting the Little Grand Canyon, Inspiration Point, and Garden of The Gods if you’re into hiking/outdoors.
Highly recommend this Airbnb and Lia as a host. Thank you so much for an amazing get away."

The house was perfect for the kids who bunked out on the pull-out couch/bed. We even built a fire in the freeeezing cold and have a nice sendoff on our last night. The kitchen and long cafe-like table was the focal point of our gatherings and long chats over coffee for best friends, reunited.
Thank you for hosting all of this, Lia!"

Lia went above and beyond with some fresh, local produce for us to enjoy during our visit. We love the landscaping and all the beautiful wildlife. Waking to the birds singing every day was magical.
We loved both the sun and the moon room. The energy in this space is very good and clear for a home with a lot of visitors. The bed sheets smelled so amazing, I want whatever soap Lia uses! The beds were comfy and we all slept very well.
There were so many amenities and every thing we could need was found easily. I even somehow forgot my toothbrush and was lucky enough to find a pack of some emergency spares. I’m not a coffee drinker, but the coffee they have smells amazing also! Our family loved our stay. So easy, quiet, and peaceful."

Beautifully clean, filled with light, thoughtful details everywhere - a basket of blankets, lots of lamps, shampoo and conditioner in the bathrooms, and of course the snack box. The whole house has such a good atmosphere - maybe because of all the nature around it. You can see trees out of every window. I can’t recommend it highly enough."

Group trip","This AirBNB was AMAZING. The house is so clean, well-stocked, and very comfortable. There's a great TV in each bedroom and the living room and everything feels really new. Lia was the best host I've ever stayed with - she asked what snacks/breakfast items we liked and bought groceries for us in advance, she provided s'mores and firewood for the fire pit outside, and when one of my friends forgot his jacket, she shipped it to Chicago!
We had an amazing stay and will definitely be visiting again. Thank you, Lia!!!"

Stayed one night","I would give 10/5 stars if I could - WOW, I was really impressed with this wonderful house. The bed was comfortable, there was coffee and water and eggs and snacks, and everything was SPOTLESSly cleaned. Lia has thought of everything you could need. The best part was sitting on the back deck and enjoying the fenced in back yard in the morning, and watching the squirrels and the birds and the flowers - it was so relaxing that I didn't want to leave. Also I enjoyed a nice night walk to the strip in downtown Carbondale and it was very relaxing.
I give my very warmest recommendation - you will not find a better AirBNB anywhere. What a great oasis! I'll definitely be booking again!"

He claimed to be the owner which doesn’t match the listing. I was at work and my kids were there bc it was no school but the car was gone so he thought no one was there. I would say be careful with this “basement tenant” he had no reason to try to come thru the front door on my kids as there is no way to the basement from the inside of the home

Stayed with kids","Samantha's place had lots of comforts of home, was stocked with the essentials plus more. Which made for a comfortable week long stay to visit with our kid who lives nearby.
The 3rd bedroom is in the attic floor, which did get hot during those 100 degree days even with the A/C on.
If you are a light sleeper, bring ear plugs, sleep mask and maybe dont share a bed. The train is nearby and can be well heard and like other older raised wood foundation homes sound travels. The wood slat blinds, which match the decor well do let light in from both the exterior solar lights as well as the early morning sun. And the mattresses are very springy so the slightest movement bounces the whole bed which meant I kicked my husband out of the bed.
The parking was an issue at timea because people in the basement rental kept parking in the driveway as well. And someone in the basement unit was smoking weed which hot boxed the kitchen in as all that seperates the 2 rentals is a basement door."

Stayed with a pet","Positives: Affordable, pet friendly, access to washer and dryer, responsive hosts.
Negatives: Limited parking, poor lighting, train noise.
We booked this place the day of travel and let the owners know we would be a late check in. We arrived after dark. Another guest who had booked the basement level had already claimed the driveway, which was too narrow for more than one vehicle. We had to park our large truck with a lot of our belongings in it across the narrow street. The lighting outside the front door is inadequate to see the entry clearly in the dark. After fumbling with the lock box, we texted the host, who informed us the key code is for the door lock. The hosts were responsive and polite. However, I would not stay here again, mainly because there were trains nearby coming through all hours of the night and into the morning with their whistles blowing loudly. I would recommend this place to groups of 1-4 people who can arrive in daylight and are used to train noise."

We especially enjoyed the back deck, which is remarkably private for being in a residential neighborhood. As stated in a previous review, hearing the cat in the basement was unpleasant. In general, though, we found Samantha’s place a comfortable stay and hope to stay there again when in Carbondale."

The accommodations are thoughtfully provisioned with soft linens / towels, plenty of lights & outlets, a variety of kitchen ware, and comfortable spots to hang out. The signage and guides are helpful without being intrusive. The pool, sauna, and Ofuro tub are lovely too. In fact, we're now pondering getting our own Ofuro tub! And we loved the books, prints, and photographs that abounded too."

There is not one detail overlooked in this place, and even though you're sharing the same property (separate buildings), they provide complete privacy.
The property itself has a robust and interesting history that has only been improved on by D. and Jane's obvious passion, care, and upkeep. You will not regret this stay. While the landscape was still impressive during our winter stay, I will definitely be coming back in the warmer months to get the full garden experience."

It's a place to easily zen out. D and Jane responded quickly when I asked for recommendations in the area. They made it known from the beginning they would be available if we need anything, but would otherwise be hands off and give us our privacy while they live on the adjacent part of the property. We were able to enjoy the soaking tub and sauna in peace without feeling like we were being watched. If you're hesitant to stay here, don't wait any longer. I'd happily book here again!"

If you're wondering if you should stay here, do. It is the most relaxing and rejuvenating place I've been since this whole pandemic started. The hosts are attentive without being intrusive, and their lovely touches are everywhere - from a little holiday bouquet of holly to a towel warmer in the bathroom to excellent books. It has the most comfortable bed I've ever stayed in at an airbnb and a beautiful garden that's a bird and butterfly sanctuary. The outdoor tub and sauna were wonderful - it's like being at your own private spa. I loved sitting in the tub and watching the birds at the feeder. They're about 10-15 minutes away from some great hiking trails. Oh, and if you like to cook while you're away, this is the place! A fully stocked spice rack *and* vacation necessities like hot chocolate and popcorn in the cupboards :) Strongly recommended."

D and Jane have gone out of their way to turn their backyard & pool house to the kind of idyllic, relaxing stay you didn’t know you needed. When I arrived, D showed me around the property and everything was easy to understand and very well communicated. They left so many amazing homemade treats and I used the fresh juices Jane left to make cocktails every evening after I soaked in the tub. The place and pool are sparkling clean and the kitchen is decently stocked (and I ended up cooking every night instead of going out.) I brought my dog with me on the trip and D and Jane were so accommodating and welcoming to him. Ended up extending my stay by a day because I loved the place so much. A perfect low-key getaway."

Jane was incredibly helpful when needed and responded quickly to our messages. The sweet touches, like homemade sourdough, pumpkin bread, goat cheese, and jam, were incredible. We felt so comfortable, welcomed, and safe. Book it now, you won’t regret it! Thank you Jane and D!"

Stayed a few nights","First and foremost, the hype throughout these many, many positive reviews is 100% warranted and deserved. This experience, curated by the hospitality pros D. and Jane, was above and beyond what I expected from Airbnb's realm of possibilities.
My partner Kerry and I spent a few days at the Pool House as a retreat away from our day to day in alcohol sales. COVID-19 has made the busy nature of that world much more stress inducing and exhausting, but our several (seriously, several) trips into the hot tub and sauna left us both feeling immensely refreshed. The Pool House is the perfect oasis that will leave you with a clear mind.
The amenities are endless. The sheer attention to detail is amazing. I don't expect to find another Airbnb that comes close in comparison. Our trip was during bleak winter weather conditions, but that didn't make it any less of an enjoyable trip. We're looking forward to returning during warmer months, too, though. Buyer beware, book this immediately! Also, go ahead and add another day or two to your planned trip here; we sure wish we did."

The space was perfectly clean, so cute and stylish, and the extra touches of the homemade breads and snacks they provided made the trip even more pleasant. I brought my two dogs along with me, and it was so helpful that they were able to provide crates for me to use so I didn't have to lug those with me.
Overall, I would recommend this airbnb to anyone looking for a relaxing getaway with wonderful hosts."

Stayed a few nights","Our hosts, D. and Jane, were the ultimate superhosts for our 3-day stay at their Pool House. Their genuine warmth and care made us feel pampered and appreciated, and we would welcome them if they come to our city. Beyond their hospitality, we found check-in to be easy. There were several aesthetically pleasing note cards placed throughout the house that made navigating all the home’s features very fun and logical. Care for detail and comfort are the best features of our stay. Jane’s fresh garden herbs, conveniently left for us, enabled us to indulge in gourmet delights that made us feel at home. Her jam, baked goods, and snacks and beverages spoiled us. The king-size bed—with a variety of pillow options—was exquisitely comfortable, especially after a soaking in the authentic Japanese Ofuro Tub-For-Two and Finnish sauna. It made for peaceful, sweet sleep. In addition, the towel warmer, fully stocked kitchen, and retro “Danish Modern” wood décor made for the perfect getaway. In fact, we stayed an extra day! Jane was very helpful to guide us to local shops and hiking trails, and D. went out of his way to help us be happy as well. This property has a fascinating history, and our hosts are stewards
of their town. We look forward to returning with our family one day."

Stayed a few nights","What a gem--far and away our best AirBnB experience! Hosts D. and Jane are outstanding hosts and even better human beings. They are my favorite kind of people: those who leave this world a better place than the one they found. The Pool House is a lovingly curated home. We loved their taste in furnishings and décor, which are eclectic and lean pleasantly heavy on a sophisticated mid-century modern aesthetic. We were delighted to find not only all the creature comforts of home, but lovely and thoughtful touches such as a gift of home-made and delicious pumpkin bread, and fresh herbs displayed on our table—in November!—to add to our cooking. All the comforts of home are here, and there are features that you would be more used to seeing in a four-star hotel than at an AirBnB rental—plush white robes for the soaking tub! We came to hike the nearby Shawnee National Forest. What a treat to come home to that Japanese soaking tub and a sauna and pool. The property and garden are huge, and a certified Audubon society butterfly and bird sanctuary. We will return here in a heartbeat. We are so grateful to Jane and D for helping us rescue Thanksgiving from COVID and this horrible year."

The hosts have put so much care into the living space, but beyond that the property itself is beautiful and relaxing. I plan to return when their sprawling garden is in bloom, because it feels like an oasis where you can timelessly watch the birds and listen to your own breathing into eternity. If they ever offer to cook for you, take then up on it! Being treated to such a flavorful and perfectly balanced meal was a dream start to my stay. The space itself is spacious (for 3) and tastefully decorated. I WILL be returning to The Pool House, and I hope next time I can pick the Hosts' brains even more."

The house is well-appointed and beautifully furnished and they provided extra special touches like fresh flowers and herbs from their garden and homemade goodies by Jane including pumpkin bread, sorbet and jam. The bed was sooo comfy and a great place to recharge after a long day of hiking in the gorgeous Shawnee National Forest. It's close to all restaurants in Carbondale and the SIU campus and an easy drive to Giant City and other great areas for hiking and exploring. The grounds are lovely with the pool and garden and a cozy front porch on the pool house for enjoying morning coffee. I highly recommend the pool house and we'll definitely be back. We may even bring our kids next time."

The house was full of little extras that made us smiile, including delicious banana bread made by Jane and a few children's books that our son loved.
It was the perfect set up for our family of 3. We were able to set our sons pack n play up on the second floor and then retreat to the back bedroom to watch TV and relax. The bed was large and very comfortable.
My only regret is that it wasn't warm enough to use the pool and see the garden in all its glory.

Stayed a few nights","Such a beautiful and unique space. Walking distance to the university and many places to eat, grocery shop, etc. The unit itself was perfect for our needs. We were traveling to visit friend and family and it was a great home base for two adults and two teen boys. The boys commented a few times on how cool the place was and thanked us for booking it, which if you know teens, never happens! Great touches like snacks (some homemade!), drinks, bathroom toiletries and a table set with bright, cheery dishes. The airbed was very easy to set up and very comfortable (the pickiest of the 4 slept there and he thought it was just fine!) We heard right away with details after booking and check in was a breeze with the code for the door. A designated parking space was a real added bonus.
Since one of us was originally from Carbondale, we didn't need local advice, but there was plenty of literature and a listing of their own recommendations so that would definitely have been covered had we needed it. We briefly met Jane and D. and they were lovely as well. Since we're in Carbondale often, we are already looking forward to staying there again!
Check out was again easy with the code and the provided list of where to put everything once we were done with it. I've stayed in a lot of airbnbs and this was my favorite so far!"

It’s very close driving distance to anything you need grocery shopping, restaurants, retail shopping, even campus. Perfect to stay in and relax. We made breakfast and grilled dinner at the house, they had all utensils, bowls, oils, seasonings we needed for all meals. The pool was very relaxing and very deep! The welcome goodies like Jane’s zucchini bread were very tasty. Jane and D are very responsive and helpful with any questions we had. I would recommend the pool house to anyone looking for a place to stay in Carbondale!"

The pool house includes a roof patio as well as an open one that is nestled in their wonderful gardens that is rich with flowers, herbs, and vegetables. The swimming pool was fabulous, and we took every opportunity to enjoy its refreshing comfort.
The home is a treasure, and the hosts are very accommodating to your needs. We highly recommend it during your next visit in Southern Illinois."

Stayed a few nights","We stayed for two nights and absolutely loved our time at the Pool House. The space was immaculately clean and very comfortable. The kitchen is very well equipped and when we arrived there were several drinks in the fridge, snacks on the counter, coffee packets for us as well as Jane’s homemade pumpkin bread and some local apples. The bedroom is very comfortable. Every last detail was thought of such as an adhesive lint roller and essential oil diffuser in the bedroom, heated towel rack in the bathroom. The hosts are very friendly and knowledgeable about the area, it was fun to get to chat with them a bit. My favorite time was enjoying coffee on the porch in the morning, sitting near the wren house and listening to the lovely birdcalls. We hope to visit again!"

Stayed a few nights","Overall an ok place. No natural Light as it is in the basement with a small window. The ceilings are very low with the bathroom mirror even lower.
When I message them I got shocked when I turned the light off I was told that was rare and don’t use that light switch. That’s fair but since it was for half the lights, it was inconvenient! When I said the sheets were covered in hair, I was told there were clean sheets in the closet. They are super fast in their response, but their responses were rather dismissive.
Since this is the basement unit, you do not have control over the outside lights. Therefore, the outdoor lights were off and it was very dark at night. You get what you pay for and yes, it was a $60 a night."

The Hideaway worked out fine for us.
When we first arrived, had trouble with the code on the door,
but called Samantha and she explained that we could attain
an actual key from the lockbox. That took care of the problem right away.
After that, it was smooth sailing for the remainder of our stay.
The living space was spacious and comfortable, nicely appointed.
The huge bed was so comfortable. The neighbors were friendly.

Comfortable bed, decent neighborhood, adequate street parking (which was a bit hampered by the number of driveways and it was garbage collection night). Check In was easy. A minor problem with the door lock was quickly resolved. Host communication and response time were very prompt. Other guests in the apartment above noisy at times but nothing interfered with comfort or sleep. Location was pretty good. Carbondale isn't a big town so getting anywhere is easy. Close to the east-west highway so access to Murphysboro and all that good barbecue was nice too. I'd choose this again for value, cleanliness, ease of access and host communications."

Stayed one night","We stayed at this air bnb for one night on the way to Tennessee and then on our way back from Tennessee. Our first stay here was a five star rating. Everything was clean, tidy and smelled fresh. It was exactly as expected. On our way back, it was clear that someone had been smoking weed (debris in a blanket and paper towels to block the smell from moving to other parts of the house)- the space was otherwise clean. I contacted the host right away and she got back to me on where to find some more clean linens, and apologized for the oversight of the cleaning crew (im guessing it may have been a quick turn around from the last person leaving and is arriving). She also made things right financially. While our 2nd trip wasn't ideal, the host was professional and quick to help problem solve. We return to this area often and would stay again! Overall a very nice place to stay with a host that communicates well."

The host was also very responsive with my messages and helpful. I will be back since I have friends in the area and you can’t beat the price!

Stayed one night","Very clean, comfortable bed, great television. Nice toiletries and great bathroom. Very close driving distance to SIU. Didn’t realize it was entrance “B” so it was unclear how to enter. Family with kids were staying above and we could smell their food (which smelled good…). Kids were running back and forth for until 11pm. It really sounded like people were coming down the steps to our room even though they weren’t. It didn’t bother us too much but I could see this bothering others. Not sure if they are long term or short term but anyone walking in that space I think would be easily heard"

Stayed a few nights","It was restful and fun to stay at hideaway! The bed is amazingly comfortable and feel rested when I get up! Love the tv and the shower too.
There is some noise from upstairs guests that you definitely notice in the morning as I think kitchen of house is directly above. But at night it was very quiet and feels luxurious/ great stay for a single person and that is why I thought it was an “ok deal” instead of a “good value” once all the fees and taxes factor in. Will stay there again though!"

We appreciated the water in the fridge and the coffee that was provided. There isn’t a kitchen, but plates, cups, napkins, etc made it easy when we got takeout and forgot to ask for those things!
This is a basement apartment and we could hear the upstairs guests, but they did not stay up late so it wasn’t an issue."

Stayed one night","My wife and I enjoyed a very nice stay. We had a little trouble figuring out which house it was at first, but we got there. The basement apartment is very nicely appointed with lots of thoughtful touches. The top space above us was being rented out as well, so there was a bit of noise, but it wasn't too distracting. Overall, it was exactly the space we needed to crash for the night as we passed through the area."

Stayed one night",I enjoyed the simplicity and privacy of the basement apartment. Hot shower with no time delay for warm up and a comfortable king size bed was just what i needed for a quick overnight. I arrived very late in the day and through my own mistake from mental exhaustion I needed assistance with the lock box. Even though it was very late the host was quick to reply to my need and did so patiently. Located a few blocks from the hospital which was a plus for what I needed this trip. Would definitely recommend.

Would totally recommend and will be staying again when coming through the area. You can hear the upstairs folks walking around, but honestly it was a non-issue."

Stayed one night","Samanthas place was a good resting spot for our cross country trip. A couple of things that weren't mentioned were that this is the bottom unit and the top unit is also rented by airbnb guests. They had some loud ""adult time"" and the ceiling is extremely thin so unfortunately we had to leave as we were trying to settle in. Which is no fault to the owner, I just wasn't under the impression it was rented by other airbnb guests from the listing description. Next, the room was pretty warm even with the screen and window open and there was no fan so we ended up having to purchase one. Third, the other tenants parked in the driveway so we had to park on the very narrow street and us being in a large truck it was unsettling. Other than these things, the room was very clean and tastefully decorated with amazing amenities."

Stayed a few nights","Nice cozy stay for Carbondale! We stayed here when this listing was operated and owned by another host and loved it. This time around we liked it, but wanted to flag the upstairs listing and all the noice from upstairs. If you a not a deep sleeper, understand that you can clearly hear every footstep, movement and conversation from upstairs. Affected our comfort and sleep throughout our trip, but overall great location and nice listing."

The only downside is that the floors upstairs creak a lot, and you can basically hear everything going on upstairs. Having the host communicate with the upstairs guests to be quiet is definitely recommended, I did that and they solved the problem right away!"

Easy walk to restaurants and probably other things (we were just passing through to break up a long drive). Very comfortable bed. It is a basement, and the ceiling is not super thick, so the upstairs renters sounded like elephants even though I know they weren't walking loudly. So just be aware of that!"
