We really enjoyed sitting out on the deck later in the evening, it was a perfect night for it! Our host provided info on local running trails and the breakfast was great! Plenty of tables were available to ensure social distancing was possible. Everything was clean. My only critique was that the shower could have had a better head or pressure, or something - it was fine, but not great for washing my thick hair."

His property manager was on top of a plumbing issue and it was taken care of within the hour they were notified. I couldn't have asked for a nicer, peaceful place to stay for 10 days."

The deck was massive and was situated just right to have an unobstructed view of the river - we were even able to set up Darren’s tent & air mattress for our kids to have an outdoor camping experience. Not to mention, the Blackstone grill was a huge perk! The dock was also a huge plus - our kids enjoyed some time with their fishing poles out there and had a blast. Darren provided a wonderful & quiet little getaway, and his communication was unmatched."

Plenty of places, activities and food within a reasonable drive. Really enjoyed hearing the birds and watching the fish jump while on the dock.
Paddle boarding, kayaking at a small lake without any power watercraft at Lake Yankton was a blast. Picked up South Dakota’s best pizza and enjoyed it immensely on the new deck.
Huge selection of trails…hiking, biking and walking."

This time, we went in spring, with our little son. And it was a perfect weekend get away.
The place is as always very clean, neat, comfortable, cozy. She even had board books out for our baby!! Even though it was raining, and she had prior engagements, she came specially to show the goats to us. And her breakfast is always was delicious.
She’s an amazing host. Very responsive.

We were able to make a last minute reservation with Gale when we saw the cottage was open for our time in the area. We have stayed at lots of airbnb's and VRBO'S in the U.S. and one in Paris. This stay was by far our FAVORITE and it is because of Gale's ability to go above and beyond with every little detail. The cottage and property are delightful and so comfortable feeling. The beds are amazing and the surroundings so quiet. Gale adds the extra touches such as homemade breakfast, bread, chocolate chip cookies, coffee, cocoa to tie everything together in a beautiful bow. We cannot wait to book our next stay at Kate's Cottage!! Thank you again for everything!"

We’ve been coming here for over half a decade and it is honestly something we look forward to every time we make the drive. Not only is her place ridiculously inexpensive for what you get, she is an awesome person, great hostess But genuinely a good human being. The first time we went there it was like a home away from home. She remembers my kids names and is the most sincere person you will ever meet. I cannot recommend this place enough. It has been nothing but great memories, good vibes, And a feeling of your home away from home. This place is a national treasure."

Especially since I booked late and Gale still asked if I wanted some cookies when she came to feed the goats!!! The cookies were warm and freshly baked and just a nice little hug before bed!
Meeting Gale and Flo were my highlights. Gale is such a nice upbeat wonderful person and you can tell they put a lot of work into this Beauty! And flo was so loving and sweet! What a good watchdog! This was my favorite place I’ve ever stayed through air bnb!!!"

Gale is such amazing woman and her attention to detail to making you feel at home is felt from the moment you reach out to inquire. The homemade breakfast was just delicious and such a wonderful treat. The beauty that surrounds the cottage is breathtaking (makes a wonderful sunrise coffee walk)! Extremely personalized stay and incredibly cozy. Finn makes a great surprise in the morning and comes to say hello. We were passing through and were incredibly lucky to have found this gorgeous gem. Do yourself a favor and go ahead and book, you’ll thank me later and forever want to come back. Thank you Gale for everything, it was just perfect and we felt so loved staying at your cottage on the farm ❤️"

I could have stayed here and never left. This truly feels like a home away from home. It is so well maintained and decorated. You can tell that there is a very caring and loving couple behind the scenes of this place. And someone with an eye for home decor.
The breakfast delivery in the morning is a bonus and such a sweet start to the day. We spent a night in the early winter here and it was beautiful but we can imagine this place being even more magical in the summer.

A unique and homey space, surrounded by beautiful farm country, with unmatched hospitality from the host. If you are visiting Sioux Falls, Kate’s cottage is worth the short drive. One of our favorite stays ever."

However the best part of this Airbnb is the host, Gale. We were greeted by delicious cookies and had breakfast delivered at whatever time we requested each morning (AND she cooked all items gluten free when I notified her that I had celiac disease!) Their home is on the property but we felt we had great privacy and the space to ourselves. It was the getaway we needed to unplug and our dog to have space to play."

Stayed one night","I wanted to treat my mom to a special getaway for her birthday, and this couldn't have been any more perfect. My mom is still talking about it! We loved every moment there. The cottage is so cozy and quaint, and the setting is absolutely beautiful. We enjoyed sitting on the front porch in the evening watching the full moon and again in the morning drinking coffee in our robes. It is just so peaceful there. In the morning, Gale delivered a delicious breakfast to our door too. Everything is done so thoughtfully. We will definitely be back to stay again and plan on bringing others to experience it too!"

Stayed with a pet","Gale's listing is wonderful, as a host she's wonderful, very friendly, very welcoming. I was excited also to have the chance to meet Flo her dog.
Everything involving the host, the property and the experience of sharing a slice of life with Gale was wonderful. There was a big negative though, me.
I've stayed at many Airbnbs in the past, we almost always bring our dogs. Up until recently we've always traveled with our big popup kennel. A few months ago I decided that our dogs never showed any destructive traits so it was a waste of space in our tight little jeep setup. As we were leaving my girlfriend said ""are you sure you don't want to bring the kennel"" I said ""nope, they're all good, we trust them"".
In hindsight that was very dumb, but also against the rules. While not mentioned in Gale's house rules page in the description it does clearly state that dogs aren't to be left alone in the cottage unless in a kennel. I missed that completely. The first night was fine, the second day, wasn't. I'm guessing they were startled by something outside, what it was doesn't really matter but our pups (I think I know which one) damaged the blinds inside of the cottage. We got the call as we were heading into Sioux Falls, Gale reminded me of the kennel policy (again which I completely overlooked). She showed lenience on us though as she allowed them to stay in the mud room, which wasn't ideal for any of us but it was an option that excused me from finding another place to stay or a new kennel. Everything else went well and as far as I can say no other hitches. My own hubris caused a dark cloud over the trip though. Sometimes we need to stop, and listen to our partners and do a reality check. I won't forget this one. Thanks Gale, I hope we're able to stay with you again sometime, kennel in tow."

Stayed with a pet","Our stay at Kate’s cottage was the much needed little oasis in South Dakota that during our cross country road trip. We appreciated all of the little things that made our stay so comfortable— cookies waiting for us, breakfast in the morning, a welcome sign and notes, toiletries, etc. Rarely on AirBnb do you find a true BnB. Gale thought of it all. The price was great and the location was worth the extra drive to be on the most charming farm. Couldn’t recommend this stay enough— it’s a must go. The only thing that would have made this stay better was if we could have spent another night."

Stayed with a pet",Perfect embrace back into the midwest. The cottage is beyond tranquil--so much personality and warmth. The bed is bliss. The only Airbnb to date I've stayed where a full breakfast was brought to the door (in a picnic basket). The cottage stands out most of all due to Gale's gorgeous attention to everything--she's on site (though my quick stay didn't facilitate meeting her) and tends to every detail first-hand. The first thing I saw upon arrival was a sign hung on the front door welcoming me and my pup by name. I loved that the cottage is disconnected. (I did have an emergency phone call that I was able to take--two bars of cell service were strong in the cottage).

That someone special is the host of this little gem! She sure knows how to appreciate her family’s heritage farm and share with others! From the greeting of her kitty and pup, to the soft lighting of the sun setting through the windows, the coolness of the a/c on a muggy night, to the thoughtfulness of Gale’s French toast sitting in the kitchen, it was all so perfect. This cottage is perfect. A lovely stopping point to rest and breathe in the beautiful surroundings. Thank you for that Gale. 🌸"

Stayed with a pet","This was the most unique and cute Airbnb!!
The cottage was super comfy and quiet. We were traveling with our 2 labs and they were able to roam the farm and check out the chickens and goats!
Gale greeted us upon arrival (and made some great recommendations for the rest of our road trip), but gave us free reign of the farm to explore (plenty of privacy). We also had fresh cookies in the kitchen upon arrival (yum)!
Gale quietly dropped breakfast off the next morning at the door (at the time we specified). It was the cutest setup but was also an AMAZING breakfast.
We only stayed one night, but this was the perfect stop on our long road trip. Beds were comfortable and we had all amenities needed; full kitchen with fridge and microwave, shower with toiletries, etc.
There is no tv, but we didn’t need it. Exploring the farm was fun and the cottage also has puzzles/cards if you are traveling with kids.
I would absolutely recommend Gale’s cottage and will be staying again when we road trip through there in the future!"

The host (Gale) is amazing--she's kind and welcoming (and is super cool with letting you chill at her dining room table if you have to get on the internet). The goats and chickens are steps away, the area is incredibly quiet, and the space is incredibly comfortable. No fenced yard but I'd guess they'd be okay with off-leash pets if you asked (mine are runners so didn't try). Memory foam mattress that is medium firm, A/C worked on a pretty hot SD weekend. The fact that breakfast is included in your stay (and the breakfast is superb) is amazing. Definitely recommend, definitely would stay again."

Gale was so communicative. The cottage was adorable. There were cookies upon arrival which was much appreciated after a long drive.
We explored the property and saw the goats and chickens. We took a walk down a dirt road. There is just acre upon acre of farmland. It’s breathtaking!!!
Breakfast in the morning was so nice and perfect before our journey back home. We had to get one more walk in before we left. There are barely any cars on the road.
What a beautiful place to relax and unwind away from all the nuisances of the world!
Highly recommend. I’ll definitely be back."

We are on a cross-country drive from Washington State to Ohio, feeling grateful for the opportunity to have stayed in Gale’s beautifully restored farm cottage as we made our way through South Dakota. Gale is the best of hosts – so friendly and helpful. We had a blissfully quiet night’s sleep and a delicious breakfast. The farm itself is a piece of history. Also in the area is an historic church (the pastor gave us a tour). Although Kate’s Cottage is out along a rural road, it is quite close to Beresford (excellent grocery store, Fiesta Foods), and not far from Vermillion. As I said, we’re hoping to find our way back there!"

Stayed a few nights","We chose Kate’s Cottage as the location for our wedding anniversary for many reasons and they all proved to be true and good. First, we wanted to “get away from it all.” The cottage is on an old farmstead in a rural area typical of what one would imagine South Dakota to be like, a cluster of buildings surrounded by a windbreak in a sea of acres and acres of farmland. Coyotes were howling at sundown on our first night and then the most wonderful quiet ever came with the darkness. There was a CD player with a little selection of music and we played the flute CD and had a glass of wine while relaxing and talking in a most comfortable living room. Sleep was undisturbed and the bed very comfortable. Breakfast brought to our door (the second reason we chose this location) was the best treat of all! Gale asked about dietary preferences and fashioned two lovely and very hearty breakfasts for us that filled us so much that we didn’t even need to eat lunch! We picked up a yummy Casey’s pizza the first night and brought our own food to be microwaved on the second night since we knew the weather was not going to be the best. The third reason we chose the cottage was because we wanted to bring our two little terriers with us. They just loved their little walks around the farm and snoozing near us in the warm cottage. We chose to visit a friend 35 minutes away in Sioux Falls for our outing on Saturday, but considered hiking in local state parks or visiting Vermillion. The quaintness of the cabin provided a setting that was super comfortable and private for a lovely weekend for us! Thanks, Gale, for being such a great host!"

It is a little, quaint, quiet, secluded cabin cottage, that just gives you that necessary break from your mundane life! It is an offline cottage, with some board games, light reads options available. Gale provides breakfast in the morning and we are suckers for that. She is very quick in responding and always available.

We have gone to her cottage in Winter and now want to visit her in the Summer to enjoy her farm as well :)!"

We brought the pooch along and were able to give him some much-needed attention. If you are looking for a quiet spot to unwind, a place where you will feel a sense of care and comfort, the cottage is a great spot. We’ll be back!"

Stephanie is a wonderful host! She made sure we knew all the instructions for how to find and enter the house and felt comfortable with the check-out instructions.

Stayed one night","Stephanie was a wonderful host- proactive communication, wonderful guidebook with great local recommendations, made sure we were able to get all settled in with no issues, and checked in periodically throughout our stay to make sure we didn’t need anything or have any questions.
The tiny house was also amazing. It was clean, had all the amenities you could ask for and more (the heated floors were my personal favorite), and just adorable. We were a little nervous knowing there were other houses near the property but we didn’t see anyone the whole time and there was a partial privacy fence that covered the view between the tiny home and the house behind it. So that was a non-issue!
Per Stephanie’s recommendations we visited Ponca State Park (I highly recommend checking it out), ate at Outlaw Pizza and stopped at B&S Trading Post for groceries. All of it was wonderful and the people were very friendly.
All in all it was a great place to stay and a fun little place to visit!"

Stayed a few nights","This place was 100% every bit of what I was looking for in a stress-free, mini-getaway - I can't say enough good things! The moment you step inside, it's obvious that Stephanie has given this little house so much love and attention! It's beautifully made and every inch feels like it was crafted for comfort. The compactness of it actually made it really easy to settle in and still keep clean while there. Everything from the large porch to the big living-area windows to the loft skylight (probably my favorite thing!) made it easy to feel surrounded by nature, whether outside or inside. And there are so many options for cooking and eating - honestly, makes you want to try a little bit of everything.
The property too has the kind of views you could just sit and enjoy again and again. And Stephanie herself was great - super friendly and it was obvious from the start that she really was as available as she promised and more than willing to make sure it was great experience. Thank you!"

Stayed a few nights","Although this is a tiny home, it seemed to be roomier than what we had expected! The bed was comfortable, the skylight was dreamy, and the shower stayed hot! (We’ve had issues with previous tiny home stays and the hot water being less than hot.) I wish the weather would have been more cooperative for us to enjoy the outdoor amenities, but it also made for a cozy time spent inside. Note there is no TV, but we had no issues with WiFi and streaming on my iPad. Stephanie went over and beyond to meet (and surpass) our expectations. We would recommend to anyone staying in this area, and wouldn’t think twice about staying again in the future! (Also, the composting toilet is def one of the better setups we’ve used.)"

Being out in the country, we were able to sit outside and watch thousands of birds during migration. The home was very comfortable, with enough room for our group to sit and visit in the evenings. Having access to the clean garage was extremely helpful with all of our gear! I slept in the downstairs Georgia room and it was one of the most comfortable beds I have slept on. There was enough space in the home to allow for our group to not feel crowded or rushed. Kary was very accommodating and between his messages and the notebook at the house with instructions, everything was very convenient. No complaints in the least bit and hope to stay here again in the future!"

The home is spacious with plenty of room for family gatherings. It’s great for hiking (almost 4 miles if you go around the block). Not so remote that you can’t get to stores and restaurants in 15 minutes. It’s quiet, very clean, with plenty of towels. The host is very gracious. Can’t wait to come back again.

Check in/out was a breeze. And the welcoming cheese/crackers/wine was a thoughtful touch.
The home is comfortable and clean with a well equipped kitchen. We cooked several meals to help save the money and tedium of eating out. The beds were comfortable, and extra blankets were nice to have in the basement rooms.
It was a nice ""home base"" for our trip, and we highly recommend Kary and his place for anyone thinking of visiting/staying in the area. You can't go wrong here."

Group trip","This place was great. It was clean and well appointed. The ping pong and foosball tables were a nice touch. It was a little far from campus and downtown by foot but heck, Vermillion is a small town and nothing is really too far away. Thanks for a nice place for my family to stay while here for our mother’s funereal."

Group trip","This is a great place to stay if you have a large family or group of individuals. We loved the many rooms with beds, not just pull-outs and sofa sleepers. The location was easy to find, and Alicia was great at communicating how to get in and giving suggestions about the community.
The place has everything you need to cook, so if you want to avoid eating out, that is possible. The location made it easy to access everything the town and the college had to offer.
My mom is in her mid-80s, and without this property, she would not have been able to come to see her granddaughter sing at the college."

The host was friendly and quick to answer emails, check in was a breeze, and the binder with restaurant menus, ammenities was helpful. The downtown area was only a couple of blocks away, easily within walking distance. The house was immaculate and showcased modern decor with a few eclectic pieces. There were board games to play, an ottoman filled with fuzzy blankets to snuggle up with on the couch and a huge TV, all of which gave a warm, comfortable, homey feel. We each had our own spacious bedroom with comfortable beds and pillows; the closets were huge with plenty of hangers provided; the biggest bonus was each of the three bedrooms having an ensuite. It allowed for all of us getting ready in the morning a breeze. The only downside was that we couldn't stay longer to enjoy this beautiful home. We hope to stay again!"

Stayed with kids","The Ponca house was perfect for my family while we attended a family reunion. A crib and appropriate toys were available for the infant in our group. The house was extremely clean, the beds were very comfortable and the AC worked perfectly for those extremely hot summer days. We met some of our extended family at the Cedar Hills Bar and Grill a few blocks away from the house for a delicious dinner. The front porch was lovely for sitting on and enjoying our morning coffee on a cooler morning. Britney was amazing to deal with and she graciously put for extra effort when some things were left at her house that belonged to a family member to make sure those items were returned. I think it is wonderful to have a great house like this in the area close to Ponca State Park."

This home is completely renovated so all the flooring, kitchen, bathrooms, and finishing's are brand new. It was obvious the furniture was brand new as well. The beds were comfortable and everything was pristine! They added really nice touches to make the stay enjoyable, especially loved the Stone Bru coffee left for us to have for breakfast! The bathroom amenities were also really nice. Overall this is a GREAT place to stay when you're in the Ponca area. You can sleep as many people in this house as you could in the mini-lodges at the state park. We will absolutely be renting this again in the future. Thanks!"

Stayed with kids","If you are looking for a peaceful place to stay in this area, look no further! Communication was great and it was wonderful to have our own space, versus a hotel or houses close together. We loved being in the country for our stay, but you do need to be prepared for the remote location and dirt roads. There are a couple of towns pretty close by, so not too inconveinent. We were in town to attend graduation in Vermillion, the drive was fairly easy back and forth from Vermillion. The cabin has everything you need, very thoughful hosts. The shower is very small and would not be comfortable for very large people. We are average height and weight, so we had no trouble. The beds may also not be preferred by large/tall people. I'm 5'6 and my husband is 5'10, we have no trouble. If you need a peaceful place to stay while in this area, we receommend this cottage and would certainly stay again!"

Stayed with kids","After going down a beautiful and scenic (and very dusty) road off the main highway, pulling into the cottage's driveway and taking everything in is an experience I hope you won't miss. The immediate quiet falls on you. Then, one by one, as if nature is a symphony, you hear the wind through the trees, birds singing, crickets cricking and the far off corn fields corning (yes, that's a word!). The daisy blanketed cottage grounds are a delight and the inside is just as fitting. We arrived and stayed for ten days during an extreme heat wave and we were all very comfortable. The cottage kitchen was not only well equipped with all you need but with equipment that worked well. Between the air conditioner and fans in every room, the house stayed cool (which was good for us as we acclimated back to the Midwest heat and humidity). Beds were comfy with plenty of pillows and linens. Our kids loved camping on the living room floor watching DVDs. Mary Ellen had excellent communication, instructions and suggestions for outings. My only suggestion would be to make sure you use the bug spray at night when going out. And you'll want to go out at night and see the expansive starry sky and LIGHTNING BUGS and hear the whippoorwills!"

Stayed one night","I stayed in the renovated chicken coop! the studio apartment like feel was very cozy and comfy. I personally didn't mind sharing a community bathhouse that wasn't attached to the stay but that's just me. the bathhouse was nicely furnished and felt like a mini hotel lol. The plot of land this place is on is gorgeous, wide open horizons for the sunset. They let me light a fire in the pit, I sat under the full moon and played guitar, dreams do come true lol. just stayed for one night, passing thru coming home from a roadtrip, and honestly am very glad I choose this place over a local hotel. it was fun, exciting, peaceful, rejuvenated the soul, and left me ready for my drive the next day. this air bnb left me with cool memories to finish off my roadtrip! Definitely staying here again someday!"

Stayed one night","If you’re looking for something out of the ordinary, a stay in a charmingly unique converted chicken coop is it. Friends asked “where did you find this place” and I’ve recommended it, planning to write a short piece of a newspaper travel piece about unique places for a weekend-getaway. Inside and out, we loved the kitschy decor, the art, and the beauty of the property and countryside. Thank you to Kelley, for her personal greeting on site and for inviting us to explore the outdoor property. Loved the sunset view from the corn crib."

They were understanding when we got in after dark, were quick to recommend restaurants on our way in, and we got such a great nights sleep in the very comfortable beds! Everything was as expected and was well represented in the posting and pictures. Since we got in late we didn't see the cool gate and fence on our way in but stopped to take pictures on our way out...it's made of bicycles and parts! Just another representation of their eclectic, whimsical stay :)"

Stayed one night","First of all, this property was GORGEOUS. There was so much to explore and see, from the gazebo to the balcony of the reception hall to the corn crib swings and on! The twinkle lights strung throughout the grounds added a magical (and useful!) element to the stay.
To all people that will book in the future (which you definitely should)- remember that you will be staying in a refurbished chicken coop. There will be some spiders/flies/other random bugs in various nooks and crannies of the place. Do not come expecting your stay to be comparable to one at The Ritz. Embrace the eccentric and absolutely adorable stay for what it is. Outside, under the stars, in the fields, beneath the trees.
Kelley was a dream of a host. She was quick to respond and very informative. She provided cereal, milk, orange juice, and a gallon of water in the kitchen, as well as plastic cutlery, paper towels, garbage bags, etc. She also had chocolates and little snack pastries in the coop for us upon arrival.
I cannot stress how beautiful and expansive the grounds of this property are. I would highly recommend the chicken coop to anyone and everyone."

Stayed with kids","Noreen is so incredibly kind and accommodating. We arrived pretty late into the evening on our check-in day, and she took the time to show us around, helping us feel safe and comfortable on the ranch. We stayed in the chicken coop, which was cozy and inviting after a long drive. The sinks and toilets are a short walk across their driveway (as stated on the listing), but this was a non-issue for us since the weather was very warm while we stayed and their light sensors turned on whenever we needed to head that direction at night. Although this was essentially glamping, there are plenty of outlets for lighting and charging phones/electronics if needed. We watched movies, relaxed, and were able to make cereal for breakfast (provided by Noreen). We even asked for extra fans to stay cooler at night. There is a window AC unit that helped a ton, but we're just not used to the humidity we experienced! Noreen took care of that and any other request we reached out for. My kids absolutely loved the ranch, chicken coop, and yard games... calling it their favorite part of our trip! The ranch location is just a short drive to Vermillion if you happen to be headed to USD like we were. Also, if you're lucky to stay on the property, you might get to say hello to Noreen's sweet pets Freckles and Moo. Thank you again for the memories, we hope to return soon!"

Stayed one night","Kelly's Farm is a fantastic and serene place. It is right off the road so easy to access.
The farm itself is very big and therefore lot of open places to explore. Kelly has decorated a section of the farm very well, sitting in that Gazebo with shade over you and the birds chirping around you is very peaceful.
We stayed in the Chicken Coop, and it is literally that, a remodeled coop.
Therefore, the cleanliness takes a hit inside the room. The blankets/throws have lot of dust in it, the bed/mattress too is not in the greatest condition.
Also, given that the restroom is a short walk away from the coop, for me to say this is good value the per night price needs to further drop a little bit to say $35-$40.
But in the mornings one will realize how beautiful the place is, we loved the place apart from a few minor issues mentioned above."

The staff are amazing: we were cooked wonderful breakfasts; everything was clean and well organized; and the staff who worked there were really helpful and friendly. The shared kitchen has all you need to heat up and serve, but not really cook.
And oh, the deck! Get there early enough to enjoy sitting on the deck with a pair of binoculars. American goldfinches everywhere."

Their hospitality was outstanding and the food was excellent for breakfast. I was pleasantly surprised by the beauty of the location and the historical significance of the vineyard and neighboring landmarks. Some of those landmarks were even part of the Lewis and Clark trail. Highly recommended, and if I am ever in Vermillion I wouldnt hesitate to stay again."

Stayed a few nights","We love Airbnb’s for the room, comfort, and privacy. This one definitely has privacy and comfort! The yards are full of over grown plants - in a good way. They shelter the property so you feel like you are in an oasis. Private back sitting area, small but private. The front porch was the place to hang outside. The bathroom is small and the only access is through two of the bedrooms but that did not pose an issue for our family of 4.
Hosts were SUPER responsive! Check in was a breeze. We had everything we needed at the house for the week.
When we checked in the AC was on (was a hot humid day so we were very thankful!) and they left the lights on for us 😊
We figured only one TV (living room) so had packed another for one of the kids Xbox. But with all the trips we took - Sioux City and Sioux Falls, we were only there in the evenings.
Which to another point - Verm is nicely centrally located to go for day trips to two large cities!"

It has one of Vermillion's beautiful iconic town lamp posts out front, a morning porch to sit on for coffee, Frnch Press and a very private back yard with flowers and plantings. Kitchen was clean, bathrooms were clean, and linens and big towels were just fine, a/c worked very well. This is a good examples of a family house being successfully turned into a very usable guest house. Hoping to come back. Loved the regional Sioux inspired art to enjoy and the fresh paint job throughout. The greenery in the back garden and off street parking gave us privacy and a few blooms to enjoy. Great for a family stay or couple's retreat with full kitchen, university event stay. They home is in a prime yet quiet spot."

The place was very clean and had everything you could need. The gas fireplace was very cozy. Only downside I saw was that the only bathroom is in the middle of two of the bedrooms, so if anyone needed to use the bathroom from the 3rd bedroom they would have to enter someone else's bedroom to get there. We would definitely stay again! Much better for a family here than at a hotel!"

I felt the cost was a little high as we have stayed in much larger homes for cheaper but I was not in a position to be picky with last minute booking. The yard could use some TLC.

Stayed one night","This place was nicely in the countryside, quiet, and remote.
While denoted as ""dogs allowed"" it definitely should not be considered ""dog friendly"". Inside the cottage, thankfully we spotted four Advils under the coffee table. Ibuprofen, as you may know, is toxic to dogs. Additionally, scattered on the grounds of the property was not only trash (paper plates, empty water bottles and soda cans), but also wrapped and unwrapped chocolate candies, which as you might also know, is toxic to dogs.
The fridge included an opened bottle of milk, which, while in date, also might've been chugged from some unknown previous tenant during a pandemic. No, thanks.
The bathroom had no hand-towels, but only washcloths well beyond their useful life to dry your hands.
The Ibuprofen on the rug, random dead insects and general dust and dead/dying plants leads us to think the cottage is not deeply cleaned very regularly.
There was a distinct lack of side-tables, so we pulled stools around to have a place to put our cocktails. The pallet-wood coffee table, though, was pretty unusable as the gaping slots of pallets do not work swimmingly well to hold beverages, remote controls, or apparently Advil.
Additionally, we will be rinsing glitter off ourselves and our dog-bed for the next several months, as it's clear some sort of glitter bomb had exploded in the bedroom, and had not been vacuumed up since The Event.
Additionally, do know if you do book this cottage, Google Maps will send you about 100 yards beyond the entrance of the Blue Tin Ranch, into a corn field. The gate is marked ""BTR"" and well illuminated with lights."

The property is big and quiet and the amenities are awesome although we didn't get much time to enjoy them. There's a very friendly older pup on the property named Maggie. I adored her although my pups were taken back and not very nice to her after riding for 16hrs :( The swings were a very cool surprise, I'm not sure I've seen anything like that. The hot tub had just been cleaned and was ice cold so we didn't have a chance to use that. The hosts were very responsive. Overall it was a good stay."

A beautiful Irish wolfhound greeted us as we drove up the driveway and Kelley’s husband came out to show us where to park. He was very welcoming and friendly.
The inside was just as nice as the pictures and had amazingly considerate touches, such as the Keurig hot cocoa and coffee; fridge stocked with creamer cups, orange juice, and milk; and the display of single-serve cereal bowls on the counter for us to enjoy for breakfast — all of which we really appreciated after two long days of driving!
We loved our stay and would definitely come back!"

In came The Blue Tin Ranch! It was truly the perfect getaway. Far enough in the country to have quiet in the morning and quiet at night. But close enough to town to be able to drive in for a dinner out and a campus visit. Loved the space & the hospitality! Fresh fruit, plenty of coffee, individually boxed cereals, & chocolate were a hit for our family!
Hoping next time we get to visit it’s warmer so that we can relax in the corn crib to swing the night away by the fire pit."

Private drive for tandem parking near rear of the house, but beware significant bird poop and some sticky leaves / flowers from the overhanging tree. Responsive hosts. Some improvements could be made in terms of cleanliness— perhaps just missing par for a short-term rental. Furnishings adequate for all activities of daily living. Aesthetically not my particular style, but based on other reviews many have enjoyed. Close to down town."

Stayed with kids","One year later, our second ""honeymoon"" stay at Kea Sophie's vintage house was very much the same as the first, except this time we were joined by our son and two grandchildren from California...and a notable fresh coat of paint has freshened up the interior. Involving family gatherings, both trips to Vermillion were charged and meaningful, and ""glamping"" at this marvelous location surely served to ramp up those visits. Location, accessibility, amenities, convenience, all things favorable are adequately promoted in the listing, but the embracing ambiance and intangibles must be experienced. This house was built 80 years before Patricia and I were married for heaven's sake, and you can't buy this kind of domestic charm, you have to live it...and preserve it.
Thanks Kea Sophie and Gabriel for doing your thing, so we could do ours..."

This house was just right in every way- and besides that, it was much more economical for us to rent the whole house for three nights than it would have been to stay anywhere else in Vermillion.

Stayed about a week","Sometimes the line seems to blur between the enthusiasm a visit generates and the housing that allows all the generous features of the away-from-home adventure to meld, but I am very clear minded about the salient features of host Kea Sophie and Gabriel's Airbnb; Patricia and I thrived there and our experiences in Vermillion were greatly enhanced by virtue of staying in such a such a curiously warm and charming house nestled in a neighborhood that at once felt familiar and friendly. If one of your things is peace and quiet, I can only report that the loudest noise I heard during our week's stay was the sound of my head hitting the pillow on a very comfortable bed. Clean? Sure. Amply stocked. Yes. Convenience? On foot, two zigs and a zag get you to the bountiful yet quaint historic main street, and 30 cents worth of gas will take you to either the franchise strip or all things University of South Dakota, depending on your bent...and back. Easy access and communication? Of course. But these aspects seem to pale in comparison to the house's character. It is an old house that has been updated just enough to maintain the integrity and grace that comes with age. It has a generous lived-in feel and an assortment of curious furnishings, each iconic, enriching, from its own era with a story to tell. Reservations about our stay? None, save this...I suspect it will be increasingly difficult to book this marvelous mini mansion as time goes on."

Stayed a few nights","Nice home in a quiet, friendly neighborhood, which is walking distance away from some great restaurants in a quaint downtown area. The Airbnb was clean and well-stocked.
We look forward to returning during our future visits to the Vermillion and Yankton areas."

Stayed with kids","This Victorian home in Vermilion, SD is wonderful. It is in a great location and walking distance to Main Street and the shops and restaurants in the area.
Kea and her husband were so kind and responded so fast to any questions we had.
The house is very clean and cozy."
