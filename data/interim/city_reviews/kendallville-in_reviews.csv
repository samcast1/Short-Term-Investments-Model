Stayed with kids","We were in town for our son's wedding and loved our stay at Big Fish cabin. Our favorite part was the porch swing on the back deck; it was so peaceful to watch the stars and listen to the fish jump in the lake. We didn't have much time to make use of them, but the cabin came with lots of outdoor activities: grill, fire ring, boat dock, and more. Inside the smart TV provided lots of options on a rainy morning, and the WiFi was fast for a rural setting. The cabin itself was spotless and well furnished, and our host anticipated the things that would make our stay pleasant."

Group trip",Beautiful home loaded with amenities! We loved the big yard and free access to kayaks. The area was safe and quiet. Great host communication and more than willing to make accommodations and ensure a good stay. We stayed end of April and they were more than happy to come pop the AC in for us as soon as possible. We really appreciated it! Kitchen was well stocked. Firewood was provided. We truly had a great time and couldn’t be happier with the amenities. Would absolutely recommend staying here!

Group trip","We really enjoyed our stay. This is a beautiful place to stay right on the lake.
Marika was extremely helpful and responsive to whatever we needed. The power went out during a rainstorm and she immediately contacted the power company and checked with a local restaurant to make sure they had power in case we wanted breakfast. She let us know when the power was restored ( we were kayaking ) , so we knew we could come back and shower etc.
The beds were very comfortable and the decor perfect for a lake cottage.
If we come back that way in the future, we would definitely stay again."

This was by far the best stocked and most thoughtful host I've ever had. They had thought of everything for the kitchen and the same for the bathroom. This for me for once was a staycation and not for work. What a cute hidden gem I will book again for a nice break! These hosts are so top notch !!

Stayed one night","Peggys place is not what i am used to! BUT she is a wonderful, kind, caring host. She has a home full of history and memories. It is like it is stuck in time.
Going through the home reminded me of sleeping over with my nana 30 years ago. It was a surprising feeling since i havent been there in decades but it was so familiar.
My husband soaked it up right away. He loved the feeling like he was sleeping over with great aunts and uncles and his grandmother.
This home feels frozen in time.
Makes the heart long for the original owners and heart swell for the current family. I would stay again and recommend.
I stayed overnight while transporting 29 dogs across country welcoming us with open arms.
Thank you for all you do. ❤️❤️❤️"

Stayed with a pet",Peggy was a wonderful host. She had excellent communication and her kindness really showed through as she made sure there were special treats for both the humans and the pets. We were in the area for a family reunion and stayed in Peggys' house with additional family members and 2 dogs. The location was ideal for us and the property was very nice. The house looked very nice as we pulled into the drive. Once we got inside we noticed that it looked like someone was currently living there. The closets and refrigerator were very full. I had a little trouble getting the food that I brought for the reunion into the refrigerator because it was very full of opened containers and partial bottles of soda. There are also lots of knick knacks and family history items that may have made it difficult to dust. The house was very large and the beds were comfortable. My son did give the piano a little play which was fun.

Our favorite were the cinnamon pretzels sticks. The place is spacious with plenty of bathrooms for a family of six. Awesome view from the kitchen as you cook or eat. We enjoyed the master bedroom with the fireplace and huge windows. The couches were so comfortable too. The doggie bags and treats were such a nice touch. We were there during winter so we couldn't enjoy the screened patio but it was beautiful! Plenty of coffee and if you by chance forgot something, Marita probably has it in her guest closet for you. Had fun playing uno, monopoly and other fun games for the family. She was so kind to leave cinnamon buns for us and they were huge! We hope to come back again."

There were yummy cinnamon rolls and snacks left for us. Which was so kind and thoughtful. She has full size shampoo and conditioner in bathrooms, a medicine closet, a game closet, an extra walk in closet, two fireplaces, coffee bar, and last but definitely not the least the screened in porch. It was a bit chilly in the mornings but we bundled up. And the views from the kitchen, dining room and master are incredible. We will definitely be back!"

The location was delightful - on a lake, so the whole weekend was peaceful and calm. We were there for an organized bike ride, and the garage was the perfect place for our bikes - wait til you see it! We also had cinnamon rolls and customized snacks awaiting us! Marita’s attention to detail and thoughtfulness in meeting and exceeding our expectations was extraordinary. Even in the midst of a family party, she was available to answer questions. She and her husband made this an extraordinary stay. We can’t wait to come back!"

She literally thought of everything and didn’t skimp on anything. Anything that we realized we had forgotten she seemed to magically have! The home was spotless and squeaky clean. She even had cinnamon rolls, a basket of goodies for us and treats for our dog waiting for us when we got there. There was even a basket with all the ingredients for s’mores that my kids loved! There were also some food and drinks that she provided complimentary. So thoughtful! The setting on the lake was so peaceful and the outdoor spaces were just as well maintained as the indoor ones. We especially enjoyed the screened in porch. Communication with Marita was so friendly and prompt. It is very clear that Marita feels personally connected to her guests and wants them to have a wonderful stay, which we definitely did!"

The home is on a beautiful setting on a channel leading into Lake Oliver. We rented a pontoon, with the help of recommendations from Marita, and this provided hours of entertainment for our kids and grandkids. Beautiful lake!!!!!! This house was perfect for our family of 8, and we made many beautiful memories. Best cottage we have ever stayed in. Marita was always available to communicate with if needed."

Such a gracious and generous host! We arrived to find special treats on the counter, even some for our dog! She provided so much history and helpful information about the house, lake and community in her guest book. A closet full of great selection of crafts and board games for rainy days, and a shed full of outdoor supplies, kayaks, paddleboards kept everyone entertained. Oliver and Olin Lakes are wonderful- even on a holiday week, we often felt like we had the lake to ourselves. Just a perfect stay! Ten out of five stars!"

Such a kind, generous host! We can't say enough about how great she is & how much we enjoyed our sister weekend getaway. It is such a peaceful, beautiful location making us feel like we were escaping reality for a short time. We enjoyed being out on the lake in both the pontoon & the kayaks & even tried the stand up paddle boards. The house has everything you need. We loved all the amenities, the screened in porch, the fire pit & the thoughtful welcome basket. Marita has truly thought of everything. We loved it so much, that we have already booked it again for our 2024 trip & we can't wait to return. Thanks again, Marita!"

The house is just perfect! It's unique layout was very conducive to private areas and was beautifully and tastefully decorated!
The amenities at the house were above and beyond our expectations- from the treat filled welcome basket to the ""anything you can imagine and more"" filled closets!
We loved the area and especially enjoyed the clip clop of the horse and buggies going by on the road. Such a peaceful area ... we wish we could have stayed and stayed but
are happy we chose this house to enjoy Shipshewana from.

She had a welcome basket for us with snacks and dog treats! The personalized letters to the dogs and us were much appreciated. Communication was excellent as well. We ended up having to leave early and we’re refunded part of our stay which we did not expect but GREATLY appreciated!

The quiet serene view of the lake and just 20 minutes away from plenty of tourist attractions makes it an ideal location. Our young boys loved seeing the Amish horse-drawn buggies and all the farm animals in the countryside. Marita recommended a fun playground that was just a few miles away. Dock Holiday is better than the photos! Marita’s hosting is unparalleled from the extra touches she prepared for us to the exquisitely decorated home and amenities provided. This property is in tip-top shape with no check in or check out issues. You will arrive and leave relaxed. It was fun for the kids and luxury for the parents!

Stayed over a week","Firstly, Brandon is a legend. He really understands his property , everything was straightforward and simple. I chose the location because it was in a quiet area and I'd be close to a job I was doing. Immediately I felt right at home, everyhting I needed was already inside. The kitchen is stocked with pots, pans, coffee machine, and blender. The couch was very comfortable (fell asleep on it like once a week), the bedroom was also great. The window looks out to the lake through some trees, the layout is was great and the bed extremely comfortable. The washer/dryer was very good and he even stocks some detergent and dryer sheets.
The neighborhood is quiet and I even found it somewhat interesting. Every Saturday I'd walk around the lake and take walks through the nearby woods.Long story short, if you need to stay in the area for an extened period of time this is the place to go."

The windows all around the cottage invited sunshine and the fact that no houses are super close allowed for it also to feel like a private retreat, which is what we needed."

There is a good breakfast restaurant (Sylvan Shores Diner) and an ice cream place (Sundaes on Sylvan) both within walking distance. The walk on the roads around the lake was very nice. We visited a winery (Country Heritage Winery) about 25 minutes away by car and stopped by Fancy Flowers and Greenhouse for fresh fruit and vegetables. Overall, it's the restful, quiet getaway we were hoping for."

Stayed a few nights","If you’re looking for a little home away from home for a super comfortable stay, I highly recommend this little stone house. The interior has been completely updated end-to-end, and everything from the bathroom to the kitchen to the sitting room is clean and modern but still cozy. Even free two car parking with easy access. One thing you will notice right off is the quiet, I stayed there for three nights and barely heard a car go by the whole time. The lake view is lovely, and it is very easy to get to anywhere you might want to go nearby. You’ll also notice all the thought that Carolyn has put into making you feel at home, from the seasonal decorations around the house to the little touches like games and notepads, just in case you need them. She also had a ton of suggestions for things to see and do in the area, and kept in touch the whole time. I would certainly stay here again the next time I’m in the area."

A small piece of paradise!!!
This quaint cottage is everything short of peacefully packed with great purpose of Relaxation. Carolyn and Greg were beyond hospitable, sharing the ins and outs and the roundabouts of Kerr island. Although you are not physically on the lake its amazing views from multiple windows throughout and a swift walk up the road. Not a stone unturned in attention to detail for the guest of the cottage. Complimentary bikes and kayaks available are a super bonus. The gas grill made it easy to cook not only dinner; but breakfast on the lake view deck. Embrace the sunrise, sunsets and Scout ( the best pup ever).
From me to you Expect to be peacefully intoxicated in this small piece of paradise.
Helpful Notes
1. Don't lock the bottom lock( embarrassingly we did twice) Super Girl Carolyn to the rescue:)
2. Don't be alarmed by the tiny flying bugs outside they do not bite ( The represent a healthy lake) repellent is in under the sink for your convenience:)
3. Be sure to check out Coody Brown Bar/Grill located on the channel (7 min drive) for Blue Gill basket. Make sure to sit on the patio lots fish and turtles swimming around and they LOVE french fries. LOL
4. Lastly Sylvan Ice Cream is a must..Honey lavender and Lemon Poppy seed cake (no seeds :) Absolutely DELICIOUS. (heads up very close but close early)
MOST IMPORTANTLY Special Thanks Again to Carolyn and Greg for being beyond Super host, but being genuine good people sharing a piece of their peace!
See ya later!!

The local area has a great bike path and The Gene Stratton-Porter House was very interesting and beautiful. A yummy ice cream shop and grocery within walking distance. If you are looking to disconnect and get reacquainted, this is your jam! You’ll love it."

Carolyn and her husband live just a few houses down and could not have been more friendly or hospitable. We took long walks around the area, rode bicycles on the gorgeous trail, and went kayaking. We also explored the various area restaurants & parks. Kerr Island is super quiet which allows for good rest and relaxation as well as the simplicity of reading a good book and playing games to pass the time. The home itself is recently remodeled and gorgeous inside."

Her place was clean and very homey, with a lot of nice touches she added to make us feel at home. We appreciated the bottled water and tea. The bed and pillows were super comfortable, so much so that I checked out the name brand. Our first night and all of the next day was rainy and chilly so we read and watched some excellent Amazon Prime movies, which we don't take time to do at home. We also biked and drove around the area, which is beautiful rolling countryside. Wednesday was a gorgeous day so spent most of it canoeing and paddle boating around the lake. So thankful for water craft! We found the Half Acre restaurant was an excellent place for a hearty breakfast. Our last morning we took our bikes up to Rome City to ride a really nice bike path to Kendallville. I would recommend that for an outing on a nice day."

Stayed a few nights","Amy was extremely attentive and available throughout my entire stay and before. I originally booked for different dates but had a work emergency and Amy was kind enough to reschedule my reservation without any fees. Her lake home is lovely for a city escape. The lake is very quiet and calm, smaller than what I expected. Definitely not a “water sports” or swimming kind of spot but good for easy kayaking and pontoon boats. I brought a kayak but Amy has a 2 person paddle boat too. The location is right off a busy road but I wasn’t bothered by the cars. The home is cozy and has everything you need from toothbrushes to mosquito bracelets! Amy was incredibly hospitable and easy to communicate with!"

Stayed with kids","Bertha and Marco's place is a lovely, peaceful, and serene house on a channel of a small lake. We enjoyed watching the family of swans in the channel. It was very quiet and calm.
Down the street, there is a small playground with wooden swings and a tennis court nearby.
The lower level of the house has a room for watching movies if the weather isn't good outside.
There is no central air-conditioning, but there are window units in 2 of the 3 bedrooms and in the lowest level; however, it was still a little hot (it was in the 90's outside).
The water is rusty, so it may stain clothes washed there. There is a filtered drinking faucet at the kitchen sink and 6 1/2liter bottles were provided.
The space is well appointed, and the decor is welcoming and lovely. My 3-year-old enjoyed playing outside in the backyard and the split-level space meant we could spread out a little.
All in all, this was a 5-star stay and we enjoyed the location and the home very much."

Group trip","Bertha and Marcos are wonderful hosts and have provided an AIRBNB with everything you'd expect and much more! Each room is beautifully decorated for a relaxing and stress free stay. Good size kitchen and eating area. Good size full bath, lots of bath towels. Large bedrooms with comfortable beds. Each night stand has built in combination USB & GFC outlets and light fixtures for night reading. The family room is a great place to just hang out and reconnect with loved ones. It's large enough for watching tv, games and conversations, without too much disturbance. The backyard is spacious for bbq'ing, yard games, or just chatting and enjoying the beautiful night sky while sitting around the firepit. There's is a short pier where you can fish or just have some quiet time and enjoy nature.
There are plenty shopping options nearby, such as Kroger Foods, Walmart and almost any fast food restaurant you can imagine.
We look forward to coming back when the weather is nicer, so that we can visit the nearby orchards, vineyards and other attractions in the nearby towns.
Thank you,
Evelyn, Nancy, Rozie and Jeilyn"

Stayed with a pet","We stayed at this lovely home for the month of February so that I could spend time with my Dad who is in rehab at nursing home in Kendallville.
The home was perfect. Well appointed. It had everything we needed to decompress at the end of each day.
The place is so cute and comfortable. The neighborhood is quiet.
Sarah communicated well and left very clear directions and helpful information.
I would definitely consider this place again. While no place feels like home, this place was so cozy it came quite close to home.
It's a great value when one considers what you pay for a hotel.
The place was also very clean. Sarah thought of everything and we are grateful that she shared this place with us."

Stayed with a pet","Sarah decorated for Christmas with a cute tree that we utilized during our Christmas gathering. We made cookies and pasta and the kitchen was very well stocked. The hostess left butter in the fridge, spices in the cabinet, a bottle of wine from a local winery, and a helpful binder with local recommendations. We enjoyed a difficult Lego puzzle that was already there.
The town of Auburn, less than 10 minutes away and easy to get too, is super cute with bakeries and gallery and other fun things to do. The house was exactly as pictured, with plenty of towels and blankets. Fort Wayne is also nearby, about a 30 minute drive.
While the house is pet friendly, the yard is not fenced in and you will want to walk your dog on a leash as there are many neighboring dogs anxious to meet new friends. While the noise did not bother me, some of the houseguests weren't a huge fan of the noise from the nearby railyard.
I would recommend staying here."

Also love the Roku on all of the TVs and the ability to login to our personal accounts like Netflix!

The neighbors were wonderful one made us cookies another gave my twin nephews and niece bubbles . couldnt have asked for a better place we grilled out most every day and had a fire in the pit most nights. If i come back to the area i will definatly stay here and i hope every bnb that i might stay in is as beautiful as this. Sarah has done a beautifull job on it. The neighbor told us the home was a railroad home and moved to this location and the wood inside was from the railroad. We wished there was a history of the house inside. Over all perfect vacation.

If you have a dog one neighbor also has a dog but they keep it tied up when it’s outside. Also don’t freak out that occasionally you’ll hear the tornado siren late at night, but the police and fire use that as an alert so when there’s a call the siren goes off and it can be a little loud late at night.

Stayed about a week","I stayed her due to my daughter having surgery @ Parkview North,- a 13 minute drive- I literally just slept there and took showers the first 4 days of my stay. Brian and his wife checked in on me to make sure I was doing ok and kept an eye that I had made it back safely at night. I was having a crazy week.
There was a beautiful bouquet of daffodils waiting on the counter and the bed was so comfy and I can't say enough about the place. I would give it 50 stars. If you need a place to crash while family is at Parkview, this is the ticket. Reasonably priced and I wish I had been able to set out on the patio and watch their cows and horses on their farm behind the house. That rooster sure let me know he was there every day lol.
Thanks again! You and Lauren are Rock star hosts."

It was rainy throughout our stay, yet, we loved the view of the lake and gorgeous fall foliage from the comfort of the living room recliners. The supply of boardgames added some entertainment to our rainy days. There would be plenty to do to enjoy the trails and lake if the weather permitted. So, we may have to make our way back during the summer! Thank you, Mary, for making your lovely home available for us!"

Although we only caught catfish from the dock, we rented a pontoon boat from the next door neighbor at a very reasonable price and we spent all our time out on the lake catching walleye, bass and crappie. Mary has a binder full of resources in the area which is how we knew about renting the boat. The cottage was stocked well with everything we needed, and then some! It was quite a delightful getaway and we enjoyed every minute of it."

Stayed a few nights","We loved Mary's house from the moment we stepped in! Pictures don't do this little cutie justice. It is a small house but very open and great for a small group. The kitchen is well stocked with any tools you may need and a modest assortment of spices. There were some kcups for us but not sure if those are stocked by Mary or leftover from past guests. There is a little screened in gazebo with some rocking chairs to sit in. Coffee on the porch in the morning was lovely! One thing I suspected but wasn't 100% sure of is that all the beds are in one giant room, not two separate bedrooms. The entire 2nd floor of the house one large bedroom. It wasn't a problem for our group. It is a little tricky to find when you first get there as it is a shared driveway but once you know where you're going it is not an issue. Mary has thought of it all, this was a great house!"

Stayed a few nights","Absolutely nothing bad to say about Mary’s cottage. We had a very peaceful and relaxing winter getaway. Everything was as advertised and more. We did get hit with a bad two day snowstorm which dumped around 12-14 inches of snow on us, but this place was a great place to be snowed in. We had no worries because she had a crew come out twice and plow out the drive and also shoveled around our car. We also got treated to a very picturesque view of the lake after the storm. If the opportunity presents itself we would definitely stay again. Thanks again for sharing Mary!!"

Stayed with kids","Prepare to be overwhelmed with this exquisite peaceful lake cottage. The quiet and intimate cottage right off the lake and surrounding neighbors were great. Once we arrived, we were amazed at the beautiful, small cottage that seemed like it was just remodeled. Smells of a brand new house. We literally walked out the front door and had a wonderful view of the lake. Our host Mary was very accommodating with us booking last minute and arriving late. Everything was clean and the amenities were overwhelmingly thoughtful. We came prepared but you don't have too, she literally has thought of everything that you would potentially need. She even had chargers for both Android and Iphones. We enjoyed some local wine from the nearby winery which was delicious. We fished off the dock which was big and spacious for 2 adults and 3 kids. One of the nearby neighbors came and chatted with us and even offered us his worms to fish with..very kind. The neighbor's definitely know that your a visitor because they are a small quaint town. There is a local grocery store that is less than 5 minutes away and we were able to stop on our way into the cottage. We were lucky enough to have booked when The Apple Festival occurred, we loved it so much. The local handmade soaps are superb and we felt very welcome. Thanks so much for a great weekend stay!! Will definitely make this a yearly or bi-yearly visit."

Stayed a few nights","The lake views are beautiful. There is plenty of space to enjoy a view of the lake whether you are inside or outside. The home is SUPER CLEAN. The kitchen is well-stocked with a variety of quality cooking ware and serving ware. Everything in the home looks new...the flooring, the kitchen, the furniture, the appliances, the bathroom, the bedroom...it's very nice. The wifi is great. We were able to stream a football game without any issues. The water in the shower was nice and hot. Mary is very responsive to any messages you send her. The check in and check out was super easy. There are places within walking distance. We walked to Sylvan Shores Diner (about a mile walk) for breakfast one morning. Lovely walk around the lake. If you are runner like me, there is a trailhead a half mile away that leads to 8 miles of jogging if you like. I saw a shooting star over the lake during our stay. We visited Sylvan Cellar for drinks and live music and had a great time. Mary truly has a lovely home and you can tell she values her guests having an enjoyable stay. Thank you, Mary!"

Stayed with kids","A great place to stay! The house is perfectly clean and the beds are comfortable. We caught catfish, blue gills and perch right from the dock. We’d stay here again if we come back to this area.
I highly recommend driving the 15 minutes to Gropp’s Fish Shack in South Milford. If you like fried fish this place is for you! It’s take out only and they aren’t open everyday so check their hours before planning a visit. There is a quaint park with a playground and picnic tables so close to the fish shack that you can see it from their place. If you have children I’d like to recommend a few fun places that we found during our stay.
Fort Wayne Children’s Zoo is less than an hour away and well worth it. We stopped for a meal at a Cracker Barrel on our way to the zoo (it’s on the north side of town) and they had great service and good food.
LaGrange Splash Pad-about 20 minutes away. It has one of the nicest playgrounds that we’ve been to right next to the splash pad. It’s all outdoors. Kids loved it!
If you go to Shipshewana there is a carousel at the top floor of Davis’ Mercantile. Worth checking out!"

We loved going out on the canoe and enjoying our morning coffee on the deck overlooking the lake. Communication was fantastic with her from the beginning with getting ideas of what to do on our stay, to the very end on our way home when she texted us to let us know we had an oil leak! We will definitely be back and bring the kids!!"

Location was great with many things to do in the area! The home was perfect if you wanted to stay in and recharge..the space is warm and inviting and spacious enough that the walls didn't close in on us! We had a great time exploring the area. If you have a boat, the dock is beautiful and well maintained! We didn't have our boat with us so can't say anything about Lake Sylvan other than it's a beautiful view from this home! This is a beautiful rental! Highly recommend!"

Both TVs had roku fully set up for minimal fuss, all the condiments and kitchen sundries were present, and there was plenty of coffee! There was also easy dock access and plenty of space to spend time down there fishing.
If you are coming for work, I would say that cell phone reception for T-Mobile users required me to go to the end of the driveway as there was no reception for calls and minimal for text messages in the cottage itself. The wifi is strong though if you have other communication options. In addition, if you have picky water drinkers, the water has a slight smell and taste that may put off some (my 7 year old) but was perfectly safe to drink. Mary has also provided some bottled water to start guests off with."

You can feel the warmth and sincerity of the owners without even meeting them. Make sure to check out the board games in the closet! Thank you guys for your hospitality and very clean home. It's hard to find much comfort during these hard times with covid 19.. but Mary communicated with us the steps they are taking to ensure a safe trip. Thanks again for the wonderful experience!

My first priority was a lake view and the big windows of the living room looking out at Dallas Lake were perfect for enjoying nature during our December stay. All the adults commented on how relaxing it was to share coffee together while watching the lake and various ducks and geese. The family room with games, large and small, was where the grandkids gravitated. It can be closed off to preserve the peacefulness of the main living area. The kitchen had everything we needed for all our meals. We celebrated birthdays and an early Christmas together, and simply made some wonderful memories. Can’t forget to mention how accommodating Sarah is! Communication was easy. We’ll definitely be back!"

Stayed with kids","Loved it! For myself and 2 teenage boys, this was a great experience. Great location on the water. 2 kayaks that the kids enjoyed (with access to more if needed). The home itself was very nicely decorated and comfortable. Had everything we needed. There were also some games in the house that my kids surprisingly enjoyed. The ring game on the coffee table was a huge hit! Lacy was very quick to respond and also sent me several messages on her own thoughts or suggestions with how to make the stay even better. She also had family just a short distance away who I spoke with. They were very friendly and helpful.
We very much enjoyed our stay and I'm sure we will be back."

Stayed with kids",Super cute place! My family had a great time here! We mostly stayed in the backyard with the fishing poles and the fire pit. Hoping to come back soon for another weekend getaway!
