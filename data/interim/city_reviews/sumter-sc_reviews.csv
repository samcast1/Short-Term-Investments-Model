Stayed with a pet","Cute little ranch located in a small, quiet town. Within 10 minutes of Sumter, which has all the shopping and dining you would need. Camden is another very cool town only 30 minutes away. Joseph is very responsive to any communication. House has comfortable beds and living room seating. Great fenced-in backyard for dogs. The half bath in master bedroom is great plus. Sumter is great city; easy to navigate with minimal traffic. Highly recommend Simply Southern Bistro for lunch/dinner in Sumter. Candy's at the Granary in Camden is great for lunch. Excellent pimento cheese sandwich.
Overall, a great house in a quiet location with a great host. Would definitely recommend staying here."

Stayed a few nights","We came to Sumter for a family trip this weekend. Upon booking we only needed room for my wife and myself. However, after my son and his wife decided to come with us I requested a change to add them to the reservation. Joseph was very fast in responding and approved the change. After a long day driving and visiting family, the home was exactly what we needed! We arrived late that night and it was well lit, drive way big enough for two cars. Check in was super easy. Home was very nice and comfortable! Very quiet area. My wife did a few strands of animal hair which is expected considering pets are allowed. Other than that we had an excellent experience. Would definitely recommend staying here!"

Stayed with a pet","This place is as nice as everyone says—comfortable, fenced back yard for the pups, clean, etc.. Kicked it down a star for three reasons. 1) Once you reserve, you get a list of rules, one of which is no dogs on furniture. Won’t be a big deal for many people, and we didn’t stay long so it didn’t matter much for us, but we wouldn’t have booked it had it been included in the rules on the listing. 2) relatedly, the hosts have posted various other rules around the house. The rules don’t prevent you from doing anything you would do (ie there is a sign saying not to pour paint or solvents down the drain), but they did make us feel a little like we were at our grandma’s house. I suppose it’s just a shame that some guest once did those things necessitating the signs in the first place. 3) none of the outlets in the master bedroom worked. Given how well kept up the house is, I imagine the host will have fixed this by the time you arrive!"

Stayed with a pet",This is a perfect place for stay if your looking in this area!! It's even worth the drive off the Interstate if you're traveling with a pup. I booked to spend time with my Husbsnd who works for the railroad and had to work Christmas Day. Super happy with our choice! The kitchen has all your essentials and then some. Bed was very comfortable and really like all the pillow options. We didn't use the 2nd bedroom at all so I can't speak to it; other then it's really large and looks for nice. The fenced in backyard was a huge plus for us since we have a Great Dane and she's not welcome most places. They provide you with amazing local information and a very easy check in and out. Neighborhood was quiet and felt very safe; we went for a long Christmas walk and neighbors waived to us ans wished us a merry Christmas. Highly recommend Lauren & Joseph's quaint cottage!!

We appreciated having a kitchen, washer and dryer, and multiple bedrooms and bathrooms while staying for a few weeks with kids. The yard is large and safe for kids and pets to play. The internet worked well. Communication with the hosts was quick and easy. The only detractor that couldn’t be easily remedied was that one of the neighbors has a rooster that likes to crow at all times of the night. Maybe bring a sound machine or earplugs!"

Great guy and very accommodating. If I should need to come back to the area would for sure stay here again.

Stayed with kids","We stayed here for more than 3 weeks during a move transition, and couldn’t have asked for a nicer, safer place to stay. House is clean, furnished very nicely, really beautiful, and very roomy. My 2 kids were super comfortable sharing the 2nd bedroom, it was a great size. The decorations made the house feel like home. Pretty much any amenities we needed were there, and Joseph reached out to me a few times to make sure we were comfortable and to see if anything needed to be refilled. He even stopped over to take care of a popped circuit breaker due to a storm. I felt that I could reach out to Joseph and Lauren if I needed anything at all. The surrounding neighbors were also really friendly, and the neighborhood was a great place for walks. We would absolutely stay again and recommend to our visiting families, and anyone looking for a comfortable place to stay in Sumter."

House was very clean. The little details were perfect. King bed was absolutely comfortable. Plenty of storage. Central air kept me comfortable. Kitchen had all the necessities I needed to prepare a meal. Washer and dryer was convenient. I really only have two small gripes: Netflix was not logged in on the television (in the hosts defense, I did not contact them for log in information and I did not use my personal information to log in) and the window dressings were sheer (not a big deal to be honest, but I would have loved some blackout curtains). Overall, I would DEFINITELY stay here again in the future. The house is more than worth the value and the hosts have done a great job with the place. I highly recommend this property."

Joseph was super responsive and confirmed almost immediately and we arrived within an 2 hours after leaving behind our previous accommodations in another town. The Cozy Cottage was everything we needed and more after 12+ hrs in the car with 2 dogs. The king bed was so comfortable and the shower was glorious. The kitchen had everything we needed to make a quick dinner and plenty of coffee for the next morning. The dogs loved the yard and it was great to have a place to let them run before getting back on the road. I’m so thankful to have found this spot and that it was safe, clean, adorable, and super comfortable. If you’re ever driving down I-95 and need a place to stop for the night, this is it!"

This cottage is a nature lover's delight and the hosts have added many thoughtful extra touches like bird feeders, binoculars for viewing, doggie bowls & blankets, local areas to visit and a list of restaurant spots. The hosts are top-notch. Absolutely recommended!"

Stayed a few nights","Lesa and Russell offer a lovely place to stay -- one of the most memorable in our eight years of experience staying in Airbnbs across the U.S. and around the world.
Most noteworthy, staying at their place is like looking out on a nature preserve. The pond in the back of the house is home to croaking bull frogs, good-sized turtles, and at least two alligators that regularly visit the deck, looking for a handout.
We were careful not to feed them anything. You don't want to befriend a 7-foot-long reptile that can readily take your hand off, but they are fascinating to observe and photograph from a safe distance high on the deck."

The setting is perfect for those who want to get away from the hustle and bustle, but still be close to town and the great parks in the area. We were only there for 3 nights, and wished we had time to stay longer. The house was very comfortable; the couch and chairs in the living room were great, and the dining table in the kitchen is perfect for game night. The porch overlooking the pond is wonderful for birdwatching in the morning, and the front porch is great for afternoon sun and sunsets. We spent both days exploring Congaree National Park and Pointsett State Park--great hiking!! Grocery shopping in Sumter was easy, and there are also restaurants to choose from. We had a great stay; I would stay there again when traveling through South Carolina."

Stayed with a pet","The property reminded my daughter and BIL of a family homestead we used to visit in summers on Shelter Island, NY. It was peaceful, surrounded by nature and had everything we needed. It was 33min from I-95 which was a little further than where we wanted to be after driving 7.5hrs. We would have preferred to have some restaurant choices in the area that did not involve a 1hr+ ride since it was just a pit stop on our route to NY. Since you don't get the address in advance, I mistakenly thought the restaurants were much closer than they were since they were in the same town. I would recommend picking up what you need in advance of getting to the house so you don't have to drive so far and extending the stay to take in the property."

The enclosed porch has a great view of the pond and the dock is a great addition. I enjoyed coffee in the mornings and fires in the evenings overlooking the water. A lot of thought went into making sure guests are as comfortable as possible during their stay. I can't say enough about this cottage. It's nice to get away from it all sometimes and this is the perfect place to do it. If you are considering booking this home, do it. You won't be disappointed!"

As always, the house is super clean with all kinds of thoughtful touches. It was so relaxing sitting in the sunroom looking out over the pond as well as enjoying the firepit on the dock this time of year. Russell and Lesa are wonderful hosts and keep us wanting to plan another stay. Thanks for everything!"

We chose to sleep on the sleeping porch rather than in the very comfortable looking beds in the two bedrooms, and I'd do it that way again next time. Russell and Lesa were very responsive with a question or two we had and were sure to follow up to make certain things were resolved. The snacks, coffee, cider, and hot chocolate were an added cherry on top. We will definitely return."

Stayed a few nights","The minute I walked onto the back porch, I knew that two days wasn't going to be enough. This is an amazing cottage! All of the charm of yesteryear, with all of the modern touches. Drip coffee and a Keurig, snacks, popcorn, hot cider, tea & coffee, well stocked kitchen, bathroom, comfy beds. The hosts have obviously spent a lot of time thinking about their guests comfort. There are phone chargers everywhere, the TV has Roku, Chromecast, and a DVD player with a great selection of movies! The porch is amazing, the hosts have put up seed feeders right on the windows as well as a hummingbird feeder. You can sit and watch wildlife for hours. The porch also overlooks the pond with a very sturdy deck/dock that you can venture out to and see fish and turtles in the pond. String lights on both the porch and deck! So awesome, highly recommend."

The little gator that we named Chomper, the turtles and little fish was one of the highlights of our stay. The fire pit on the deck was an added bonus for roasting hotdogs and marshmallows for smores. The sun room was also one of our favorite places to sit, relax and watch the humming birds/birds at the feeders. We felt right at home. It's so peaceful, private and beautiful at this cottage.

Stayed one night","This place is a peaceful getaway, surrounded by nature and beautiful scenery. The house is just as pictured. It has two bedrooms with comfy beds but also has two twin beds in the 4 seasons room which was awesome to sleep on. The deck overlooking the private pond does have an awesome small alligator who came to visit many times. Turtles and small fish were abundant in the pond. We did drive the 8 minutes to town for breakfast and dinner but there is a full kitchen so you'd have everything you would need to cook if you bring your own groceries. The snacks and microwave popcorn were a nice surprise. Coffee bar was also great in the morning as I made a cup of coffee and sat out on the deck and just listened to the birds. The AC was wonderful on a hot day. The host was very sweet and very responsive. Wonderful visit!"

Just like the others have said in the reviews, it’s even prettier in person. The view on the back porch is perfect while sipping on your morning coffee.
We saw the small alligator while we were there, which was really cool!
We did bring our eight-month-old baby, and it was great. With her crawling around, we keep a very close eye on her. I can see why they would warn against bringing children though because of the glassed in porch and of course the alligator.
The hosts were great and even had snacks waiting for you. They always responded and were easy to talk to . We will definitely try to stay here again the next time we are in the area!"

We spent most of our time relaxing on the sun porch overlooking the pond and dock as well as some time on the dock. We even got visited a few times by the two small gators. The cottage itself was extremely clean with everything you need to feel right at home. Russell and Lesa were great hosts, and we even had some time to meet Russell and learn some of the history of the place. I think we only watched about 30 minutes of TV the entire weekend because we couldn't bring ourselves to come in from the views of the porch. We highly recommend this cottage if you are looking for a spot for true relaxation and can't wait to come back for a visit!"

Stayed with a pet",WOW best describes our reaction upon entering Lesa’s and Russell’s Cottage. One night (our stay) was not nearly long enough but if that is all the time you have don’t be deterred. Lesa and Russell have thought of everything one might need right down to extra toiletries and even yoga mats on the porch. The pictures do not do Justice to the setting. I could spend a week just sitting on the porch watching nature. But don’t. The cottage is secluded but only a 10 minute drive from the charming town of Sumter. We will be back and will recommend a stay to everyone traveling through South Carolina.

Stayed one night","The pictures don’t do justice to how beautiful Russell and Lesa’s home is! The house itself was lovely and stocked with everything you could possibly need, but the glass porch and the dock were where we lived during our short stay. We had so much fun watching the birds at the feeders attached to the porch windows, and the pond was absolutely magical. As soon as we arrived we changed our dinner plans and ordered takeout instead (lots of restaurants within a 10 minute drive) so we could sit on the dock enjoying the beautiful flowers and watching the ducks and alligator! The gas fire pit was wonderful to keep us warm late into the night as we continued to savor the solitude listening to the frogs and crickets and looking at the stars. The hosts were great with communication and helpful with local suggestions. Our only regret is that we were just passing through the area and couldn’t stay longer! We’d highly recommend this home to other travelers and can’t wait to stay again ourselves."

Stayed a few nights","Needed a stay for a wedding weekend getaway and stumbled upon this gem!
LOVED the location: secluded, quiet, right on a lovely body of water with beautiful scenery. The home itself is very clean and tidy; just a well put together and cozy home. There are several amenities the hosts offer that go above and beyond basic needs. The hosts themselves are very kind, respond quickly with clear answers to your questions; they really give you a sense that if you needed anything they’d be more than happy to help with whatever you asked of them.
My friends and I couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay. It definitely fit our low-key, relaxing, nature-loving personalities. This is a really nice place to call home while traveling. :)"

Stayed a few nights","Russell and Lesa's cottage was perfect. The location is private and quiet, but very close to ""civilization"" with restaurants and shops nearby. The couch and bed were so comfortable, and I really appreciated the handheld shower head. Everything was very clean (but no overpowering cleaning product scents) and in working order. We had everything we needed (and more) to prepare meals at the cottage. The dock has been recently rebuilt and was a lovely and peaceful spot to sit quietly, and watch the ducks if you are lucky! The bath linens were lush and plentiful, and the bedsheets were crisp and clean. I recommend the cottage without hesitation. Thank you, Russell and Lesa!"

The house is pretty, large and always cool despite the outside heat. Armchairs and beds are comfortable inside as well as outdoors or on the veranda. Appliances are functional and not very noisy. Anything you need is available. Really everything has been thought out! In the pond behind the house we enjoyed looking at the turtles and an alligator. The city of Sumter is full of shops, shops and other facilities. The accommodation is also well placed to visit Charleston, the plantations and gardens. I would gladly return to Russell and Lisa's place. Thanks again to both of you!"

The property is very quiet and peaceful - we walked our dog to meet the cows in the morning and relaxed and watched hummingbirds and turtles around the pond in the evenings. It is well stocked with everything you might need and incredibly clean. We highly recommend the cottage, as well as Russell and Lesa’s hospitality!"

We really enjoyed just sitting in the glassed porch overlooking the pond and watching the turtles and other wildlife.
We only met the host briefly, on the way in; but they were very nice and they had the house fully ready for us to have an enjoyable stay.
So glad we chose this place and definitely want to return there for our next visit to Sumter"

We brought a sound machine which helped. Their son came to pick up the garbage (he did not come in the house) but they communicated that fact to us ahead of time so we wouldn't worry.

Stayed with a pet","We needed a place to stay for my son’s graduation that would allow pets. The backyard was large with a chain linked fence, which provided a secure place for our dog to run and play. The direct neighbor dogs were friendly to our dog which was nice. The home was clean and tidy. If you need a place to stay for you and your furry friend, near Shaw Air Force Base or just passing through, Ana’s home will meet your needs! Only thing missing was my comfortable bed but for 2 nights, we made do, so our dog that was recovering from surgery could still get the care she needed. Willow 🐶 loved that she made new friends and got to come on a road trip with mom and dad, she said to tell Ana thanks for having a home that allowed pets!"

Stayed with a pet","Lovely place and stay here in Dalzell. It was cozy, clean, and carefully appointed.
Many pros:
+good location and close to my relatives house
+immaculately clean
+nice washer/dryer and detergent/fabric softener supplied
+WiFi connection easily accessible
+very easy clean up directions
+safe and secure neighborhood
+host communicated quickly; very friendly
A few cons, but not enough to taint my review:
-no bottled water or decaffeinated coffee available
-Bedroom #3 only has a futon and not a regular bed. There were four of us but no one wanted to sleep on the sofabed.
(NOTE: The Airbnb photos showed the futon bed so I couldn’t take off points since I knew ahead of time. I just wish there were also a regular bed, too).
5/5 in all areas except for overall value. I would prefer to have 3 regular beds for the price per night.
Hosts were lovely and I would gladly stay again if I only needed two regular sized beds."

It was a very peaceful place both inside and outside. The seating was comfortable and the chair in the living room , we found to our delight, were recliners. We had a wonderful weekend visiting with family in the area. Both my parents were so happy that we had this spacious beautiful home instead of hotel rooms. The kitchen was well furnished for our cooking needs and the beds were comfortable and everyone slept well and peacefully. We had an absolutely wonderful stay. Ana was a perfect and responsive host. Clearly a 5+ star home! We hope to come back next year and stay even longer."

Ana was very responsive and it was easy to find and get into the house. Carpets could use a cleaning or replacing with a washable floor - accepting pets in a rental with carpet is bound to be problematic. Otherwise clean and comfortable for the few hours we were there.

Ms. Ana was a very pleasant host. My family and I stayed there for my son’s 14th b-day weekend. We all celebrated it at a NASCAR race in Darlington. The house was very beautiful, quaint, spacious, clean and peaceful. Even the neighbors across the street greeted us with a warm welcome wave 👋🏾. My kids enjoyed their own rooms and even my wife, who is very picky when it comes to Airbnb’s was impressed. I would definitely recommend Ms. Ana’s AirBnb to others and hopefully, we can book another stay in the near future!👍🏾"

I wish we could have stayed longer but we were just passing through on our way to Orlando, FL as we do every other month, and we just needed some where to relax for the evening and pick up where we left off the next morning. Ana was very responsive and polite as well! We will be booking in the future for sure! We also checked out a little restaurant called ""Henry's Bar & Restaurant"" it was roughly an hour from her place but well worth it! Thank you again Ana for opening up your home to us all!"

It is situated in a very nice and quiet neighborhood and a law enforcement officer lives directly across the street for even more added security.

Stayed a few nights","Our stay was pretty decent overall and if a few things are tended to, it would be a great space to stay. Due to the season, there were a few caterpillars crawling around but nothing alarming. The home was moderately clean and neat but some areas needed deeper cleaning in my opinion. The beds were not comfortable but everyone has a different preference. The layout was great and the neighborhood was safe and peaceful."

The front door key pad stopped working and Joe was there within 15 minutes and had it fixed. He checks in to see if we need anything and this stay has all around been the best stay i’ve had & i’ve been traveling for 3 years now, so that’s saying something. I couldn’t ask for anything better!"

Stayed with kids","The place was cute but had an awful smell of animal. There was dog hair all over the bedding and we had to wash it before sleeping. The bath tub jets were full of mold and we had to clean that as well. There was good amenities for cooking since we stayed there for a week it was good to not have to buy salt pepper oil and stuff like that. But again, the smell was really bad in the house and in the garage because there was a trash can in there with old trash in it. Also, the ceiling fan in the master bedroom was loose and made the loudest noise when it was on. All small issues that can be fixed!"

Stayed a few nights","The house was in a safe and quiet neighborhood. There was room for two cars in the driveway easily. The place looked like the pictures. It had everything you need in the kitchen. The bed in the master room was hard and the beds in the front room were springy, this doesn’t effect my review as I know everyone’s bed preferences are different. They appeared to be new mattresses.
The only reason I had to give 4 stars was there was a fishy smell the entire time we were there in the house. You could smell it as soon as you walked in the door. We bought a candle and it didn’t help. It almost seemed as though someone cooked shrimp and hid one somewhere. Other than the smell, which I’m sure is fixable, this was a great place for the price."

Furniture and beds were comfortable but the house was not family/toddler friendly. We had to move several things so our son wouldn’t destroy decorations. Smoke alarm went off at night and woke our son up. Someone was mowing the grass on a Sunday night around 7:45/8:00 pm. And a neighbor knocked on our door at 9:00 pm another night to tell us about some owls that were hooting in the back yard. Really? Just like Sumter…not the best."

It did get a little noisy in the evening because it was steps from the mainstreet area. We were originally going to bring our dogs, but changed our plans last minute. They would have loved it here.

The climate controlled sunroom was such a delight....we spent our mornings sipping coffee and looking out over the lovely view. And having a garage for our car was unbelievable!

The only negative is the downstairs bedroom, which isn't very private. Evidently, we didn't look close enough to the pictures online to notice this."

Additionally, the host's attention to detail was evident in every aspect of the property. From the plush bedding to the well-stocked kitchen, every comfort was thoughtfully provided.

The property itself was enchanting and well-equipped, providing everything we needed for a comfortable stay. The check-in process was seamless, and the host's communication was prompt and friendly throughout our stay. We especially appreciated the front porch and coffee in the mornings! The cleanliness of the space was impeccable, and we felt at home from the moment we arrived. Overall, we had a fantastic experience, and we are grateful to the host for their hospitality. We highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone visiting the area! You can’t beat this price!"

The bedrooms are large with comfortable beds and high quality linens and the bathroom was huge. Everything was spotlessly clean. The outdoor screened porch and patio were perfect for our party to enjoy spending time together. The host was easy to deal with and responsive any time we needed her. We will stay here again very soon!"

The bath towels and bed linens were soft and of good quality, and everything smelled clean and freshly laundered. The mattresses were comfy and of very good quality too. The street was picturesque, quiet and safe. The house also has a gorgeous front porch with a swing that is so enjoyable! Check in was easy. Yolanda and her husband were amazing hosts! Helpful, friendly and VERY responsive to my inquiries and needs. They really go out of their way to make sure their guests are having a pleasant experience and have everything they need. Bravo, Yolanda! And thanks!"

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed our stay at Carolina Casa but we were alittle disappointed when we pulled in (after dark) to really high grass. Although 1st thing in the morning Kodee contacted us, Checking to make sure we got in ok and wondered if it was ok if someone could come cut the grass. They were there in 2 mins. Check in was really easy. Home smelled wonderful & looked like the pictures. The description says there would be shampoo/cond/bodywash. There wasn’t any there. We stayed for 4 nights, there was 1 1/2 rolls of toilet paper in each bathroom. Not a huge deal, just make sure to bring these things. Beds were comfy, bath towels were great & inside home was clean. We were hoping to light the burn pit (make sure to bring wood) in the evening in the back yard but the steps down to the the deck were rotted/missing a board and not real safe. To spend time out there, we would’ve had to clean up BBQ ashes & pit was full of water, a few toys scattered. We just avoided it. Great location. Friendly host."
