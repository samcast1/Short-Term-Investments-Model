Stayed a few nights","This was the second time that we have enjoyed the Pfaff house. My daughter got married this weekend and her bridal party weekend was here a few months ago. We have photos to follow as my daughter and her bridesmaids prepared, my daughter did her first looks before heading to her venue, she stayed two days previous to the wedding for down time. Madison was awesome in communicate and accommodating our every need to make this weekend very special. 5 star rating on her service, the beauty of the property and the entire weekend."

Group trip","We stayed here for my daughter’s graduation at Illinois State University. It was the perfect place for us. Madison was so accommodating and responsive. Place was the perfect family place and all the stores are nearby which made it easy to navigate around. Kitchen and living room was our favorite part of the house. The beds were so comfortable! My daughter and her friends really enjoyed the bathroom with the vanity mirror. Overall, we had such a great time the airbnb was beautiful and cozy. We also took the perfect pictures outside of the house! Definitely would stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","Attractive home with old world woodwork inside. Everything was just fine. I esp liked the way she had 3 different firmness to the bed so you could pick. Plenty of seating, shade trees, channels on tv, many kitchen supplies. Mom older mom was looking for a traditional coffee pot. She learned the Keurig. walking distance to farmers market & music at the park. Surprised with notable good coffee cake waiting for us in the morning. This maybe a newer listing. (The only thing I might add is scissors in the kitchen as people tend to order out or bring supplies in.)
Thanks for a nice place to stay."

Stayed with kids","Sharri's home was clean, comfortable and just lovely! The kitchen was really well stocked for cooking and had a great ambiance, as did the entire home. The beds were comfortable and so was the temperature in the house, upstairs and down. The ceiling fans were on when we arrived and added such a breezy, open-air feel! It was heavenly. We were also greeted by smiley face cookies in the kitchen from the local bakery. How fun was that! Also, a 12 o'clock check in and check out is so rare. What a wonderful thing to offer. Our stay was appreciated and enjoyed by our entire party of 6! Thank you for sharing your home with us."

This unit has all the things one may need, even down to the many board games provided. The space was decorated and utilized amazingly! Had plenty of room for the family and very clean. There was also a second bathroom upstairs that could be used as needed. Our favorite thing was the cafe downstairs for the awesome breakfast and coffee to get our day started."

Stayed a few nights","Our stay was fairly short (just two nights). The loft is very athletically pleasing, but not overly comfortable for resting (harder cushion type chairs and sleeper sofa). There was some leftover food items from other people, and some of the laundry not finished. but, Brandi and her husband were really responsive! The coffee shop below in the mornings can get a little loud. overall, pleased with the space! it made a cozy meeting spot for a girls weekend. Make sure to check out Java Cafe downstairs! Delicious coffee, baked goodies and lunches."

Group trip","We so enjoyed our stay at the courthouse loft! The space is decorated so thoughtfully and the history of the building is so interesting. The beds were comfortable and the Airbnb had so many extra touches such as phone chargers, plenty of towels, board games, some basic cooking ingredients and fully stocked cooking utensils. We loved being able to go downstairs in the morning to the adorable coffee shop and how quiet and peaceful the area was at night. El Paso is a cute little town and convenient for us to drive into Chicago for part of our trip. The drive was not bad and definitely worth it being able to stay in such a cute Airbnb. Highly recommend!"

Stayed with kids","The Courthouse Loft was just as fun as the description lead us to believe. Traveling cross-country, we've stayed at a lot of Airbnb's and one of the things that really stood out about this place is the white cotton sheets on all the beds. These are the types of little details that make for a five star stay. The space was utilized incredibly well. Our large family was not crowded at all. We didn't have time to explore the town, but the coffee shop downstairs was great and I saw on the map that there is a tea shop nearby. Afternoon tea and a stay in the loft would make for a great little trip."

We arrived at an eerie rainy and windy hour of the night so going into a small town off the beaten path seems a bit sketch but as soon as we went in the place it was very well kept and felt cozy, homey and clean. We got immediately excited. Don't second-guess it. The history of it makes it even cooler to be there. Book it!"

I've passed thru El Paso when old route 51 was the only way to get there. I've never taken the time to browse the town. Beautiful community, again I could easily live there, if I needed larger town amenities then Bloomington is just a drive south. Hmmm, retirement?"

Everything was clean and lots of additional stuff for you to use if you forget something. The hot tub was super nice and it was very well decorated thoughtout the place. Cafe was lovely. Food and drinks were delicious. Tv was great and had hulu, netflix and other things you could sign into which was really nice. Very cozy and warming place. Would 100% recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","Responsive host, great space (photos are accurate), nice amenities, and a comfortable place to spend a weekend. BUT, there is a lot of noise from the downstairs cafe throughout the entire day (when they open at 6:30/7 until they close late afternoon/early evening). You can clearly hear people talking. So I would definitely suggest bringing ear plugs, using a noise machine, or even ear buds if you want to sleep in even a little. And if you’re intending to work from home and you need some quiet, again some noise canceling headphones are probably necessary."

Stayed a few nights","The courthouse loft is a beautiful and serene space. We loved the thoughtful furniture and decor, the intriguing historical elements, the private hot tub, and how everything we needed was already considered and provided, from pizza cutters to full cookware to cozy blankets to several streaming channels. We also enjoyed the cheery art-filled cafe right downstairs for coffee and an extra spot to relax with a book.
While the listing photos are lovely, they still don’t fully capture the airy and upscale feel. With very high ceilings, stylish furniture, and impeccable decor, it’s a wonderful place for a relaxing getaway, to stay in and enjoy some peace and quiet. It was also seamlessly managed, clean and organized, and all aspects of check-in and check-out were clearly communicated, which overall made for an even more easy and peaceful stay.
We are likely to return in the future and looking forward to our next opportunity to stay here!"

This is the perfect destination for a relaxing weekend getaway. The hosts clearly put a lot of thought and effort into decorating the space with both class and consideration to its history. The private patio with hot tub is also a very zen area. As an added bonus, every morning was filled with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee from the coffee shop below. Literally the only downside to this hauntingly gorgeous space is the distance from home makes repeat visits a challenge. Thank you!!!"

Bed was comfy and cool to wake up thinking about all the old courtroom back in the day & the cases that probably took place. Can't beat an airbnb above a coffee shop. Coffee was great, so was food and very reasonable prices for a coffee shop. El Paso was a quaint little town with great antique shops. Would stay again!"

Stayed with kids","This loft has been on my wishlist since I joined Airbnb but I didn’t really think I’d ever stay as it’s only 2 1/2 hours from home. However, we decided to get in one more quick getaway for a few days before back-to-School activities starts so I planned a trip around El Paso and we had a great time. The loft gives you all the “downtown” vibes while also being rather peaceful. I love the easy self check-in, everything was as described and very clean. The space feels nicer and more spacious than the photos can show. There is a bonus bathroom in the building for the upstairs offices that came in handy when one of our 3 girls was taking too long getting ready! The back patio was a fun wind down at the end of the day. Even my 15 year old enjoyed the bunk beds! We loved heading down to breakfast in the coffee shop. The neighborhood is wonderful for family fun-clean, peaceful, amazing park space and local restaurants. Reasonable drive from incredible hiking, history, and Route 66. Perfect!"

Stayed with kids","All I can say is WOW! Just WOW! Verdict is clear - you have created an amazing space! You have extreme mastery in utilizing space and creating such a luxurious-feeling airbnb. There were plenty of linens and pillows and even a treasure trove of board games to play that the kids enjoyed. Great place to unplug and unwind. It was just what we needed for my husband's photo shoot for his cutting boards and such.
I was SO excited to learn that there was a hot tub!! And the patio space was so beautifully decorated. My husband and I had a short little luxurious escape while the kids slept in the loft. I would have liked to stay longer!
Thank you for sharing your space with us!"

The modern bathroom, with washer & dryer, the full kitchen, the extremely high ceilings, the flood of sunlight in the late afternoon when we arrived, the eclectic, lovely furniture, comfortable bed with the delightful triple bunks for kids, books, toys, popsicles, and the original low railing with swinging doors from the former courtroom...all made this unique place very special. We were sorry to have only one night there and will definitely try to return. Having a coffee shop below is a big bonus! It was quiet in spite of being a popular and busy morning place."

Stayed a few nights","Brandi is a responsive and gracious host and her place is an amazing find! I grew up in the area and remember what many of these historical buildings looked like before folks like Brandi acquired them. Brandi turned the old City Hall and Court House loft into one of the best Air BnB’s I have ever stayed in. I travel back to Central Illinois from my current home in the Rocky Mountains to see family in the area and Brandi’s Court House Loft is spacious, beautifully decorated and so comfortable , you will opt to “stay in” and invite others to join you at the coffee shop downstairs . I will be honest. I was tempted to write a bad review in hopes to keep this place a secret . It’s that special. And the Java Cafe, just down the stairs from the loft is so convenient and adds to the hometown flavor you would want in your stay. Everyone is so friendly and the staff so gracious. I plan to book this place once or twice a year every year."

The town doesn't offer much and the views out the windows aren't appealing (we just shut the shades :) ), but since we were just traveling through on our way to Springfield, we didn't need entertainment. Bed was comfortable. We didn't use the bunk beds, but they were a really nice feature.
Kitchen had everything we needed for dinner in but the appliances/utensils were very basic. Bathroom also lacked some expected toiletries (body soap). We would stay again, but we would be sure to bring some of our own amenities next time."

Being able to head downstairs to get our morning coffees and breakfast was the perfect ending to our overnight (LOVED the gluten free Everycado Toast!)

It was warm and welcoming, with lots of Christmas decorations as a bonus:) I loved that it was above a coffee shop for easy access, however, it is very noisy and you can hear every coffee grind and conversation downstairs. Also, if you randomly stay on the first Tues of the month, the siren sounds like it's attached to the outside of the building and will deafen you, haha. Bed was overall comfy, but the pillows were pretty thin and uncomfortable. The fridge also needs some cleaning. Overall, it was a nice stay and I felt very cozy. I would recommend:)"

Stayed with kids","This AirBnB is one of my absolute favorites. The esthetics were great, the vibe was spot on and there is almost everything you could ever need. We fit our family of 6 (16, 9, 4 and 2 comfortably) and everyone felt so included like they had their own personal space. The toys they include for kids and adults alike make it a perfect spot for a one night stay as you are passing through or an easy destination for vacation. Some complained in past reviews about being woken by the sounds of the coffee shop below but that didn't seem to be a problem at all for us. It pleased every one of our family members in one way or another. It is a great place to gather a bunch of friends, bring the family or getaway as a couple. I'm already trying to find a way to come back! It was well worth the 8 hour drive. Can't recommend enough. Also, everything smells great. The blankets and even the throw pillows smelled like they were freshly washed between guests. As a studio style setup, I was a bit worried about how the space would feel... it was so spacious and lovely. You won't regret booking. We stayed on Halloween so our kids got to put the town to the test and it was a lovely, friendly, safe town from our experience."

Group trip","When I booked location I informed them that I would be coming for my wedding. There was a major event that blocked off all the roads to the location and was never informed ahead of time. Parking was a disaster and noise was even worse. There was band music playing till 2am in the morning the night before my wedding. It’s above a coffee shop with extremely thin walls so at 6 or 7am, you hear people talking loudly and machines grinding. The room itself is beautiful (reason why I booked it) but just like the 100 year old windows and etc.. it hasn’t been dusted in forever. There were left over popsicles in freezer and fridge was dirty. A lot of this would be forgivable and understandable if it wasn’t an important weekend for me and didn’t add to the hassle of everything. So, in conclusion if it were a random trip and you don’t mind not being able to sleep in this place is for you."

Stayed a few nights","The courthouse loft was just as spacious and Insta-worthy as the photos made it seem! And it really does get GREAT lighting. The beds, couch, and seats were all comfortable - the wooden desk chair was one of the comfiest wooden chairs we have ever sat on! If you're going to use the desk though, just be aware it's a little wobbly for someone who types intensely, but the table and the counter were perfect alternatives. The loft is over a lovely coffee shop and it has the usual coffee shop hours, which means you might be woken up early if you're a light sleeper. Otherwise, it was the perfect ambience for a writing retreat.
We actually left earlier than planned because, while it was clean, it was extremely dusty. All the members of our group had terrible allergies that greatly interfered with our time there. Whenever we went downstairs to the coffee shop for a while, went outside, or wore a mask, the allergies went away. We let Brandi know and she said they would do a thorough dusting next time.
Java Cafe downstairs was a wonderful and brilliant addition that the owners thought of (it's SO convenient!). We ended up getting our breakfast, snacks, and a lot more drinks down there than we planned because we really loved what they offered!"

The Java Cafe right below is a wonderful amenity to have so close at hand...a huge menu of drinks and also delicious fresh baked goods.

Stayed with kids","Our stay at the Courthouse Loft was perfect! We are a family of 4 (3 & 6yr old) and really enjoyed this rental! Some Knick knacks were placed up high for safer keeping and returned to their spot upon leaving. The spot included all the amenities you would need. The Java Cafe below was adorable and yummy! They offered full on breakfast with gluten free options as well if you are celiac like me. That was definitely an unexpected bonus.
If you’re looking for things to do with your kids in the area -
•We went to the Children’s museum in Normal (way lower priced than the childrens museum by us). The kids had so much fun with 3 floors of fun.
•Comlara Park Glasener Beach in Hudson was a great spot! Sandy lake with bathrooms, showers, lockers, concessions food and fun! Only cost our family of 4 $7 to get in.
•Fairview Aquatic Center in Normal. Slides, splash pad, zero depth entrance pool up to 12ft depth.
We had a great time at the Air BnB and found lots to do nearby! Would recommend as a family stay, solo break or romantic getaway!"

We just loved the adaptation of a beautiful, historical space that was so tastefully decorated. We enjoyed the selection of games and such a peaceful environment. Even though the temperature outside was extremely hot, the loft was luxuriously cool. Brandi was readily available before and all throughout our stay, and she couldn't have been kinder or more helpful . It was fun to head down to the coffee shop to enjoy a treat, coffee, and some local art. Our stay felt good for the soul. We were sad to leave!"

The kitchen area is fully stocked, so bring nothing! There were plenty of linens and towels to use. We also enjoyed the tv and Roku, which allowed us to stream some movies and tv shows we enjoy. There are games galore here, and plenty of children’s books to keep everyone entertained.
Check-in was easy, and after about 5:00, we had the entire building to ourselves…super quiet. We parked on the street at night, and this is a super safe area.
We will definitely be back, and I highly recommend."

I had to focus on a deadline for a project when I got there, conveniently I was able to grab a coffee from downstairs and sat down at the most beautiful table, spread out and focus!

The furniture was comfortable, clean, and well-placed. The beds have new mattresses and the frames did not squeak. The mattresses are firm memory foam, which I found very comfortable.
There was a typo in the wi-fi password, but Julie came over right away and took care of it right away. Julie was very responsive and communication was excellent.
The hot-tub was excellent: Clean, hot, with tables nearby for towels, water bottles, etc. There was a fence sufficient for privacy without feeling walled off. Mature trees abound.
The kitchen was clean and appointed in typical airbnb fashion. The Keurig/drip coffee machine worked well and came with variety of k-pods and ground coffee. This was greatly appreciated, especially by one of my tweens.
Overall, a great value and we would gladly stay again"

Best part was the huge Roku tv which made every night movie night. This place is definitely a steal for the price! There was coin laundry directly across our apartment and free parking right out front. Leslie and AJ were one of the most accommodating Airbnb hosts I’ve interacted with. AJ lives in the building and would promptly assist us with anything we needed. Leslie is a very friendly and really cared about marking sure we were comfortable.

Super friendly,
Accommodating and very nice house for a short getaway!"

Stayed with kids","This place was an unexpected gem. One of the best short stays we have had with Airbnb and our family rents with Airbnb monthly. The home had a high level of cleanliness, which made this place a standout since the COVID-19 pandemic--i feel like the standards have gone done since the pandemic. Cleanliness is VERY important to me when renting a home. If it's not high level clean, I feel uncomfortable and often will not leave a review because it definitely would not be a 5 star review.
This place was bigger than it appeared in pictures. The furniture and decor were tasteful--another factor that stood out as many places have furniture that looks worn out. I thought it was nice that there were plush robes for guests in each closet. There were specific towels for the hot tub. We enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this rental to anyone coming into the area."

The timing was perfect as we had worked a busy week and needed to relax. we snagged dinner to go at Acres Inn in town (HIGHLY recommend!) and came back to eat. After eating, we relaxed in the hot tub. The jets were great, and the tub was nice and warm. The bathroom was very clean, and the shower was great. There were soft linens throughout the home, and the bed was very comfortable. There is the cutest park and splash pad nearby, so we are hoping to return again with our kiddos. Lindsey was a great host and had excellent communication leading up to our stay. We will definitely return! Our only regret was that we didn't have more time there."

From the time of booking, Lindsey was very friendly and easy to communicate with. She provided clear check-in instructions, replied quickly to my questions, and was eager to do what she could to make our visit pleasant. It felt like we were personal houseguests of our most stylish friend :)
The house is so cute - perfectly styled light fixtures, wall art, furniture, bedding. It really felt like a treat to stay there! The couch is huge and so comfy for hanging out and watching Netflix on the giant TV. Outlets, light switches, and amenities are clearly labeled throughout the house. Comfortable beds with luxe bedding, USB charging ports on the bedside tables, the neighborhood was nice and quiet so we slept great.
We walked from the house to downtown Pontiac -- it's a great little town to explore. We had a fantastic experience with Lindsey and the house, and plan on staying here again next time we're in town."

It was EXACTLY what I needed. She was very quick to respond to my every need and very gracious as well. The house was spotless, had everything that one would need to be comfortable and feel like home. Fenced in back yard for pet, hot tub and great neighbors. The neighborhood was extremly nice and without disturbances. Huge front porch to sit on after long day. TV with Roku in every room, washer/dryer and very comfy beds. I could not have asked for more, i had a great 3 weeks and felt well rested when i got back home. Definately worth it, downtown right around the corner, shops food, swinging bridge and museum, who knew all this in Pontiac Illinois, but true, was a wonderful place. I thank Lindsey for everything and remember, there is a vacuum cleaner in the room next to living room :))"

A second separate bathroom on the first floor, which included a bathtub, was very handy for our young grandchildren.
The house is well equipped with a dishwasher, washing machine and dryer. The kitchen has plenty of crockery and cutlery and a good sized oven.
The front porch area is a great space to watch the squirrels and bunnies, while the garden surrounding the house is a good area for children to play in safety.

Thank you for your hospitality and allowing my guys to stay at your property it was clean and convenient. Thanks for your understanding with the date change and providing quick turnaround on refund, the team definitely wishes they were able to stay longer but duty called at another project. If we're ever in the area again, you will definitely be our preferred lodging location.
Thank you

This place was so cute and fit 8 of us perfectly. The only trouble we had was getting the thermostat to stay set higher than 55, but it eventually did. First part of the night was chilly, but you can’t control the weather and we came here in the middle of a snowy January. Overall very great stay and we would love to come back in the warmer weather!"

Linda takes the time to have all the extras for anything you’d like to do. There were bikes, Ingredients for s’mores, a book with local attractions and much more. We only wished we had allotted more time.
In short, Linda’s house was cute and perfect for us. Thank you, Linda for allowing us to use your place."

The weather was too cold to enjoy the porch or fire pit but we’d gladly meet there again in better weather! Meanwhile the rooms were comfortable and we were pleasantly surprised by the dining options in nearby Bloomington/Normal as well as the town of Lexington itself.

Be sure to browse the photos of the remodel to see the home's transformation. We'll definitely consider staying at Linda's again!"

Stayed one night","The WiFi nor the TV worked, I booked this place with it saying it had WiFi and a separate workspace as I needed to get work done on my trip south. There was no separate workspace and I waited up for hours for a fix to get work done. Tabitha’s solution was for me to wait until morning and go to the local coffee shop for free WiFi. She also said it was because of a storm, but it was sunny out and still no WiFi or tv. Disappointed with experience. She also was not responsive or could fix the issue so I had to use airbnb support. I was not going to leave a review and move on, but if she left a negative review on mine when I was not in the wrong. I also wish she would have reached out to me directly instead of doing so in this manner. Other reviews have also complained of WiFi, I’m not the only one whose had the issue :/"

Stayed one night","Quaint historic building. Loved hearing about the history from the host. This unit & the rest of the building are definitely a labor of love for Tabitha & her team. It is obvious that a lot of effort has been made in the spirit of preservation. It could be even more of a gem if a higher level of basic amenities were included by the host, such as better quality toilet paper & shower curtain. A supply of some basic snacks & bottled waters without the expectation of an extra payment would go a long way to welcoming weary travelers. The unit consists of 3 rooms with ceiling heights of 12 ft. or greater. This allowed Tabitha to install some beautiful fixtures for great lighting. However, there are only 2 HVAC vents in the ceiling and they did not seem sufficient to cool the space. Location of the thermostat in a closet was confusing to us. Unit needs a smoke detector in each room mounted on the ceiling, not at doorframe height. Overall a good experience & served our needs for 1 night."

The Post Office Suite is absolutely charming. We loved the exposed brick. Lots of space. The ceilings are incredibly tall with massive windows on the south side. Tabitha was a wonderful host making us feel very welcome. El Paso is a charming little town with a walk/bike path. We enjoyed meeting some locals at Topsy Tavern and a delicious breakfast at Java Cafe. We brough out bikes and locked them up in the back courtyard but I have a feeling that locking them was unnecessary. We were just passing through and stopped in El Paso to break up our drive. So glad that we did.

Stayed with a pet","The post office was charming and we feel Tabitha has done a great job creating a cozy space. However, brick debris aside, we feel that a deeper cleaning between guests (such as the fridge), or if some time has passed between stays, a touching up (dusting etc) of surfaces would greatly enhance the confidence of your guests that a thorough cleaning was done between patrons.
Tabitha was very responsive and helpful with a Roku question and we enjoyed her suggestion of breakfast at the local coffee shop. We also enjoyed the walking trail and felt very safe in the space and town. We'd love a chance to revisit her space in the future."

Stayed one night","The old building has a cool vibe, and it is evident that the host is working to rejuvenate an unused space and preserve history. That being said, my daughter and I felt pretty uncomfortable staying here. There was no one else staying in the building, and the surrounding area felt abandoned except for a few people coming in and out of the adjacent bar. There was also a room in the apartment that was blocked off by just a curtain on a tension rod that had exposed wires and evidence of water damage. This would not be a safe place to bring a small child. It would also not be advisable to bring anyone with mobility issues, as the old, uneven stairs would be difficult to navigate. That being said, it was conveniently located 4 minutes off the interstate and it provided us a place to sleep before we continued on our journey. Nothing went wrong, we just didn't feel very comfortable there."

The only complaint isn't a big deal if you can sleep through a constant loud sound. The heating system is loud, and right by the bedroom.. so if you cannot sleep with that kind of background noise, avoid the 'post office' suite at this location. The other rooms available may be further from the heating system so not an issue.
I didn't have trouble sleeping with the heater on, but others may not be able to."

I stayed in El Paso for one night before heading to Bloomington for a family event. Tabitha was incredibly accommodating, as my flight was delayed multiple times and I was late getting into town. The building that houses the suites is a fantastic historical landmark, built in the 1870's and maintained wonderfully. The main sitting area with the built in bookshelves was so cozy, especially as I sat at the kitchenette counter and watched the first snow of the season. The space was meticulously clean and stocked with coffee, appliances, and toiletries. The exposed brick and functional windows in the bedroom made for a magical overnight stay, and Tabitha was gracious in extending my checkout time to allow me to finish a conference call, making an already great stay even better.

We loved the roomy & quaint atmosphere in a small town & will definitely be back to stay! What Tabitha & Ty are doing in restoring this old Post Office building to Suites for guests to stay in is so commendable!!! it takes a tremendous amount of hard work & dedication & money to do so. We wish them blessings & good luck in their endeavor!!!

Very cozy and comfortable. The history of the building is amazing and comes through in every room. If you’re a history buff, definitely stay here and be sure to take the tour of the building.
El Paso is a small quiet town, there is a bar/restaurant next door to the accommodation, and a VFW across the tracks, a family restaurant, Mexican restaurant and fast food places nearby.
A few other bars & a pizza place are the entire town, but they were closed during my stay (M & Tues.)
There is a great walking trail right outside the door, several antique malls, and only 20 mins from Normal/Bloomington area. Several breweries 15-20 mins away!"

Stayed one night","Tabitha's place is funky and eclectic. It's a fun space and of very good value. And we appreciate that she let us book for only 1 night of the weekend. Here are the only things that kept it from being a 5-star review:
1) The hallway light from the building was on all night and shining through the bedroom window, which disrupted our sleep. We were surprised there was no curtain we could close to keep the light out.
2) Part of the couch doesn't have much cushion left and you sink into it.
Also please note they host weddings in the building, so it's possible for it to be loud / hear music and dancing into the evening from your room."

Stayed a few nights","I really, really enjoyed my stay in the Post Office room. Like everyone else, I strongly recommend paying for the tour. It’s a wonderful way to experience the property, get to know the hosts, and fully understand the history of the space.
Just to dive into specifics, the room was well equipped with all of the things one might need to reheat food and cook small meals.
If you want to cook a real meal, I recommend reserving the kitchen downstairs. I did that and it was very pleasant.
My only personal suggestions would be to bring your own toiletries (there are some provided, but you’ll probably prefer your own) and bring a robe!
This is a big, beautiful historic building so the ceilings are very high and heat rises. You’ll probably want a robe and some slippers to stay extra cozy.
Anyway, this was such an incredible stay. I’ll 100% be back and have already recommended it to several friends!"

I would make the short 35 minute drive over to El Paso and rent out this AirBnB over and over again. Just simply beautiful.
Tabitha is also an amazing host! She is so warm, accommodating, and is so great with communication! You can just tell that she is the NICEST person. She is totally made for the hospitality business!
If you are currently looking at this listing, word of advice... BOOK it ASAP!!"

We've got high risk in our house and so we're being extra cautious and trying to not interact with other people. She met me outside, masked up to show me how the door works. Very thoughtful and much appreciated. And the space is crazy cool! Perfect for an overnight. Highly recommend."

The owners have done a wonderful job of fencing and landscaping however so privacy is not an issue. This cabin is very well stocked from the kitchen to the game room everything you need plus more is there! We were six adults and two kids and all had plenty of space. The bathroom is huge, the beds are comfortable , really great place. Recommend staying here!!! The only thing I will say is the hot tub was a little dirty and overall it is a cabin, so there are a few bugs and some dust, but that’s all part of the charm!"

Unfortunately the weather was so cold and bad that we had to cut our trip short and we barely used the hot tub. It was all well kept and we had an extremely relaxing weekend.

Stayed a few nights","We had a very pleasant stay at the schoolhouse. Host communication was good, and everything pretty much lined up with the expectations from the listing. We were worried about it being cold or noisy based on other reviews, but were pleasantly surprised that there was minimal traffic noise and the house stayed warm enough, even with -8 degree lows. The hot tub was great. The kitchen was not super well stocked and was missing some essentials like a sponge or a full set of measuring cups. Would also recommend bringing your own bathroom toiletries, except for hand soap. The TV seemed older and streaming speed was spotty. The wood on site was pretty wet, so using the wood stove or fire pit was a challenge - would recommend picking up your own wood and bringing fire starters. Grocery stores and restaurants were conveniently close. Definitely check out the friday night fish fry at the Lake Road Inn! Overall we had a really nice getaway for 2 and pretty much had everything we needed."

We did a night of games in the garage, walked to the nearby lake, did a full Christmas dinner using the kitchen, and used the hot tub every night - cabin had everything we needed! Brandi was super responsive and accommodating. My only gripe about the entire stay is the cabin is directly in front of a 4-way stop so we were a little worried about our dog and we did hear some noise when the occasional motorcycle went by."

The hot tub was clean, well kept, and private. It was so nice to have the ability to have a fire outside and to have the wood available to use for it was an extra bonus. The cabin was cozy and comfortable. The décor added an extra touch to the schoolhouse theme. We would definitely stay again with no hesitation. Everything was easy and self explanatory."

You can tell a lot of thought went into the decor inside and outside, from the school-themed decor to the cozy lights outside. Everything was clean and comfortable, and anything you needed was provided and pretty easy to find. We loved the hot tub and making a fire/s'mores, and you'll see plenty of wildlife when you're outside. Definitely take a walk over to the lake, it was really pretty and we saw chickens, birds, and deer. The Lake Road Inn is a 2-3 minute drive and had a decent fish fry if you're looking for food, but we went to Hy-Vee in Bloomington (about 10-15 minutes away) and were able to get everything we needed. Super cute, cozy, and definitely unique! We will definitely return!"

The area is beautiful surrounded by woods and we spotted deer, chipmunks, and lightning bugs at night.
We walked into the game room/garage and the kids were beyond excited. I taught my daughter how to play ping pong and we all enjoyed the air hockey. We went to dinner at the Lake Road Inn and loved sitting on the patio amongst the tropical plants.
There was plenty of room for all of us to have our own space. The kids loved the bunk beds with the wonderful selection of books and I found my bed to be really comfortable.
I loved reading the history of the schoolhouse and appreciated the tips on where to eat.
I wish we could have stayed longer to explore the area and check out the hot tub. We’ll definitely be back!"

Stayed with a pet","The Schoolhouse Cabin is overflowing with charm. Cozy and cool. Comfy yet stylish. Rustic but upscale feeling. Far enough away from Bloomington/Normal that it felt like a lake retreat, but close enough to go into town daily for vacation activities. Beautiful outdoor areas. The bikes were a great plus for our family. Firepit too. Allowed family from different states to come together and bond, making memories that will last our lifetime. Thank you, Brandi. The care you put into your vacation home was felt by us as your guests. Also appreciated that Brandi was laidback, not checking in on us unnecessarily. Let us be, peacefully. No onerous rules. Just basic be-a-good-human ones. I've never seen so many deer before, either! Pretty cool. The steps up and down between rooms was fine for us but like description says, should be considered for those with mobility issues. Didn't realize game room detached from house, but no biggie. Overall, A+ stay and experience."

We couldn’t shower as the shower did not work only bottom one worked for baths. We didn’t take shampoo or conditioner because in the amenities section it mention the house had some. Thank God there is a Walmart close by so we drove to Walmart for shampoo, conditioner and blender. We took food to cook and we did not take a blender because in the amenities section it mentioned blender. Not all bicycles are in working conditions. They respond quick to messages. We liked the house and history but for the cleaning conditions and missing amenities that made us drive out to Walmart we think it is very over priced for 3 nights."

Dishwasher was completely full of dirty dishes from whoever stayed last and had not been run or put away. There appeared to be dried blood on the side of the downstairs toilet and on the floor too. While the place is labeled as ""pet friendly"", would have appreciated a thorough lint rolling of the main couch in the living room because it was very hairy upon arrival. Luckily there were extra lint rollers in one of the lower kitchen cabinets that we were able to use. Hot tub was extremely easy to use as a first timer. Game room garage was fun too, just know that it's not an attached garage and you will have to walk across the yard to access. The downstairs bedroom was super comfy and has wonderful blackout shades. Roku TV had Chromecast built-in which was nice. Loved the reading window nook upstairs too. 12 minutes away from downtown if you need anything (WMT, TGT, etc.)"

There were clean dishes left in the washer, some minor dust, and some pet hair left behind.

Stayed a few nights","My partner and I really enjoyed our stay at the schoolhouse cabin. It was clean and comfortable, spacious (standouts include the kitchen and bathroom), full of cozy nooks and corners, and the vintage school decor is so charming! We enjoyed quiet mornings reading on the couch, cooking meals together in the well-appointed kitchen, and sipping hot cocoa while doing a puzzle (shoutout to the impressive game room!). The hot tub was clean and well-maintained, and has a handy opening bar which made getting the lid on and off a breeze. It's a 16 minute drive to get groceries in town, and we enjoyed a nice winter walk around the nearby lake.
It's worth noting that this may not be the place for folks with dog allergies or limited mobility. There was some lingering dog hair on blankets and furniture from previous furry visitors, and the spiral staircase and stone-paved entryway might be challenging for some to navigate. But it's as cute and cozy as promised and we'd love to return someday!"

Group trip","The space is gorgeous, Brandi did a wonderful job with a binder in the home giving you all necessary information.
The kitchen was well stocked and the house had all the tools and amenities we needed.
The space was clean, comfortable and wonderfully decorated.
It was a bit on the drafty side so if you’re going in the chilly months I definitely recommend bringing warmer lounge wear. Although they do provide extra blankets and a wood stove so it’s not a large problem regardless!
We’ll definitely be booking again!"

Stayed with kids","What a beautiful and peaceful retreat! Our family of five took a long weekend get-away and were thrilled to stay at such a charming and cozy home.
Highlights:
The library was just so lovely. Our daughter was obsessed with it, and the abundance of cozy places to sit and read.
The house was stocked with everything we needed, from dishes to extra pillows to fans in the bedroom!
The game room was extremely fun, and the hot tub was perfect on a cool night.
Thank you, Brandi, for a great stay!
Tips for those staying:
The steps are a big part of the house! The step off the deck to the main door is a little precarious. There is a step into the living room/down to the kitchen that every single one of us missed at one point. I thought he would get better at it, but we ended up putting a chair there to remind us, so be mindful."

We enjoyed seeing the local wildlife and surrounding nature areas. While there was plenty to do outside, the inside of the cabin was also very comfortable. What I enjoyed most was the decor of modern meets historical landmark. It was so intriguing reading up on the history while also having those additions (such as the lovely shower and the family room) to make it feel like a home away from home. Highly recommend for anyone looking to have a fun, relaxing trip."

I will say I would have enjoyed it more if I didn’t have a mobile baby and a very young toddler to worry about on the stairs and falling off of the side of the stairs. But the kids did great, we used a pack and play upstairs and never let the baby out of it when upstairs. Our two year old thankfully is cautious and wanted to be carried down the stairs. We ordered food from the bar/grill up the road and it was delicious. The garage was a great addition too. My kids loved playing out there. I do not know if there was any AC though so in the summer it was muggy. There were also bikes that my teens enjoyed riding and seeing the deer around the house. A really well thought out and set up Airbnb. I would love to go back with just my husband sometime."

The lake is very close and there are places to walk, run, or bike. You don’t even have to bring one because bikes are furnished! You can have a friendly competition with the people you came with in the game room located right across the yard. Or you could rent a boat and go out on the lake. We didn’t even get to all the spots in the cabin and around it for enjoying R&R. This was a great place made even better because we could have our toy poodle with us and she’s family!"

We tried out the Lake Road Inn for dinner (down the street) and the Java Cafe in El Paso for breakfast and LOVED both.

Stayed one night",Tonya was the perfect hostess. We booked her Airbnb because we were utilizing her event space below for my daughter’s bridal shower the next day. It worked out perfectly and we were all very relieved at how smoothly the weekend went. I highly recommend Wells on Main in Fairbury both as an event space and bnb. Tonya is very easy to work with and always available with quick answers for questions. The space has been tastefully decorated and is so well maintained. We loved everything about it and definitely will be back!!

We celebrated a belated Valentine’s Day and it was perfect for a romantic occasion. Tonya even provided a full bottle of champagne and about 8 servings of a delicious local pastry. We were wowed. It’s about halfway to our daughter’s house, so we are hoping it’s available for our future trips."

It’s also just steps away from Lost in Time, a local spot that serves up massive cinnamon rolls and brunch classics like country skillets and biscuits and gravy.

Stayed about a week","Tonya was a great host. It was a great place to spend a week back in my hometown while attending my class reunion.
The town clock strikes on the hour which can be annoying. In addition, the train goes thru during the middle of the night and blows its horn frequently which is disturbing.
Tonya makes it very clear there are steps. We are in our late 70's so getting two large pieces of luggage up the stairs was a challenge.
I do not mean for any of the above to be negative. Just information.
It is a gorgeous place. They have done a great job restoring one of my hometown eyesores to a beautiful place. Loved having a kitchen to prepare breakfast and lunch.
Tonya was always checking on us to make sure we had what we needed. I have stayed at other AirB&Bs never to have any contact with the host.
Enjoyed our stay at a beautiful place.

My heart was so full after our stay. The room was BEAUTIFUL! My husband and I both said that we felt like we were living in a New York apartment, it was so gorgeous! The pastries that welcomed us upon our stay were so delicious (and I’m a picky bake goods person because I love to bake😂😅)! I highly recommend staying here❤️ I’m super sad I missed out on t$3 champagne due to being pregnant, but I definitely enjoyed my sparkling grape juice 🥰"

Several welcoming amenities were provided: locally baked pastries for breakfast, chilled bottled water, and a bottle of champagne. Plenty of space, separate living room and bedroom areas. The bathroom is a treat: spacious shower with 2 individually controlled shower heads, and a freestanding soaker tub that is spacious and comfortable, even including a tray that has a book stand and space for drinks etc. I felt totally at home. The town has lots of interesting architecture, and a very nice grocery store is practically across the street. More dining choices than one would expect in a small town. Off the beaten track, but still convenient to major traffic arteries. Rates are excellent. Everything was clean and in wonderful condition. I was delighted by every aspect of the rooms themselves, and a very easy and straightforward process of booking and payment."

I took two long baths in the most incredible, deep bath tub. I had breakfast at Lost in Time. Really fell in love with this town.

I found this place and I'm so glad I did. From the moment you walk in, the decor is just beautiful, the tub was so relaxing, the bed and couch were comfy. The area downstairs is breathtaking for weddings or parties. I showed my 9yr old daughter the pictures and she even asked me to take her there...LOL so even your family can stay if needed.

Tonya gave great instructions for accessing the apartment and stayed in touch just the right amount through out our stay. The champagne was a nice touch and the danish was fantastic. Great restaurants around and really good coffee close by at the coffee steamer. If we’re ever back in the area we’d be sure to stay again.

We were able to relax and enjoy a breakfast “in” as we are road-tripping. I highly recommend this stay for anyone looking for a cute and quiet town and a beautiful and comfortable place to sleep!

Having a full kitchen and a washer and dryer was very nice for a traveling family. The bedroom bed is super comfortable. Lots of room for a family to stretch out and relax. There’s a leather couch and chair with an ottoman, and then three stools at the kitchen island. There are two futons which aren’t too bad to sleep on, but I would recommend bringing some air mattresses, there’s plenty of floor space for them. Also plenty of room for a pet crate. The unit is on the second floor but has two entrances, one in front right along the store fronts, and one in the back by your private deck and private parking. We hope the next time we’re back to see family this exceptional home is available!!!"

The location was great (we drove in during a TON of fog, which was Not Great) and we would've explored the town little more but had to move on. It was so nice to be in our own space after starting in hotels the three nights previous. Especially wonderful to do laundry & take hot showers. Beware: there are 21 steps leading up to door, so pack light!"

She was quick to respond to our inquiries and communicated fast if we would be able to switch our stay from the Loft to the Nook and we were more than happy to as the Nook is on the first floor and was easy for us. The entire place is very well equipped and the layout and designing gives it a much appreciated homey feel. The location was perfect for our dogs as it had a back entrance the led to an alley and grassy patch. It is attached to the Main Street that has pubs and stores along it so there was some noise but nothing that kept us awake or disturbed our stay. Would highly recommend"

Stayed a few nights","We stayed in Loft 444 for a Thanksgiving escape from the city, and it was great. The pictures of the loft don't do it justice - the space is huge and spotlessly clean, with great eclectic decor, comfy furniture, and wonderful nice touches. Minonk is a very small town with an interesting history as both a railroad and mining town, and the loft is in the middle of a row of beautiful old storefronts. Because of COVID-19, we unfortunately didn't get to experience the bars in town. It is about 30 minutes to the state parks (Starved Rock / Matthiessen / Buffalo Rock), where we hiked every day. Cathy was a great host - excellent communication, easy check-in, and she really went out of her way to make sure our stay was worry-free."
