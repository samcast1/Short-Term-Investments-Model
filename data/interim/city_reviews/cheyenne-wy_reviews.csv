Stayed a few nights","A Perfect Getaway
When we first was suggested this house on Airbnb, it seemed almost too good to be true. There must be a catch! But everything was as perfect as it seemed online. My host, Rose, is the most thoughtful and gracious host we’ve ever encountered.
The house itself is a gem. The kitchen is compact and contains everything one needs. The beds are comfortable, the bathroom is pristine, and the front porch is a relaxing getaway. I explored the area based on Roses excellent restaurant recommendations and had an amazing meal at the chop house down town Cheyenne.
But what truly sets this experience apart is Rose's hospitality. She went above and beyond to make my long weekend comfortable and relaxing. From providing local tips to ensuring our stay was seamless, she wad an exceptional hosts.
Thank you, Rose and Cheyenne, for a wonderful weekend! I'll definitely be back.
Warm regards, Rick"

It’s very warm & welcoming. Lots of little details to make your stay comfortable. Loved the neighborhood. Our host was great. Always responded quickly. We were there for the holidays & the house was decorated beautifully!

Group trip","First when we got there we passed the place a couple of times because we couldn't believe this beautiful place was where we were staying. It was decorated so lovely we just thought we were in the wrong place. Then walking into the door, just took our breath away. We arrived late and we just kept looking around the place to take it all in. When we finally got to bed we were so in love with the bed and the bed linens we just felt like we were sleeping on a cloud. We have our own AirBnB that we rent out and my Husband who isn't a man of many words or opinions kept telling me, take a picture so we can try to do this in ours... he said that 3-4 times! That says a lot. We came in with my in-laws and my Mother to celebrate my Niece graduating from Nursing school and the house was so accommodating to all of us and we felt spoiled the whole visit. If we ever find our selves in Wyoming again we will for sure be back to stay at MAMA's house! Thank you for everything."

Stayed a few nights","Rose's place was incredible!! I would live in this house in a heartbeat! Everything was clean and every detail taken care of. We were never in need for anything and if we did need to contact Rose, she responded within minutes and was super helpful. We had one evening we had made plans to go out but decided to stay in so we could enjoy MAMA's house instead - movie night in the basement was just what we needed! Beds and furniture were very comfy and kitchen was stocked with all necessities. The words ""I love this house"" were muttered over and over by the 4 of us throughout the 3 days we were there - so absolutely perfect!! Don't hesitate for a moment if you're thinking about booking - you won't regret it!!!!!"

A lot of thought went into this airbnb and it really shows in the details. On top of that, Rosa is a kind and communicative host. When we realized we left some items behind, Rosa was easy to reach and went out of her way to mail them. Thanks again Rosa! We can’t recommend this stay enough."

Not like many Airbnb’s where furniture, appliances and bedding are cheap and not well maintained. It is close to downtown and so quiet and peaceful. The beds are so comfortable and the bedding is lush and so comfortable. This little place is a gem, and Rosabelle responds to all communication immediately. She also attends to little details that means so much. I was late arriving to the house in the evening, and Rosabell had gone in and turned on the house lights and the porch lights so I would be welcomed into this adorable little home. I see why she is a super host!"

Stayed with kids","5 Star Cheyenne House
Accommodations
The house was big enough to accommodate 6 people, yet felt cozy at the same time. There was room for everyone to have their own place. Yet we still gathered at the downstairs tv area.
The house was well decorated with newer furniture. Most importantly, the place was clean. We have been to quite a few BnB rentals where we wanted nothing to do with the kitchen area.
Location
We felt that we were never more than a quick car ride to the sites, scenes and places to eat in Cheyenne.
The train museum, the Capitol Building, Cheyenne Frontier Days and plenty of place to eat where all nearby.
Hosts
There is no doubt that we would stay again with Rose and her family as hosts. They responded right away to our questions and requests.
Need extra toilet paper because you have four kids? Rose has it delivered to your door.
Need a recommendation on where to visit or a place to eat? Rose lets you know where to go.
Have a problem? Any problem? Rose and her family will speak with you directly over the phone, no matter what time of day, to make sure you are taken care of. It is comforting to know that you can actually speak with someone over the phone, and not have to text, email or use an app.
This was our first time visiting Wyoming. Rose and her family made our stay enjoyable thay we are already thinking about returning next year.
If you want updated decor, a clean house, close to everything and great hosts, this is the place to stay."

The quality of the linens and towels were great. Everything in the remodel was done with so much care and thoughtfulness. We loved the sitting area next to the bedroom to make coffee. After a long day of driving it was so nice to sit in the very comfortable den and relax. It’s a beautiful home with lovely decorations. It was very quiet and inviting. They had cold water in the refrigerator and granola bars for breakfast - if you are in a hurry to be back on the road! I really wish we could have stay there forever!

The remodel that she did is simply the best I have seen in an Airbnb - I got to stay in the bottom floor, and it was like having a luxury condo to myself - the whole place is really nice and everyone appreciated it.
On a personal level, Rosabelle was SUPER accommodating. I've probably stayed in more than 50 airbnbs, and Rosabelle was the most helpful. I didn't get to meet her in person, but when I had an issue, she bent over backwards for me."

My only reason for the one star being docked is because the room “fresheners” were so strong and over whelming that even I was a bit thrown by then and I’m not usually that bothered by them. This honestly wouldn’t have been to huge of a problem had you been able to open any of the windows, but there are no screens, and the ones I tried could not be opened. Just something to be aware of, but otherwise the place is very very nice!"

Group trip","This is your Airbnb for sure if you are in Cheyenne. The hosts has gone way above what most Airbnbs offer. This is probably in our top 3 that we've stayed in over the years. The decor is spot on & lovely. But the kitchen was very well stocked, entire place was clean and the washer/dryer were very helpful in our stay. They responded to our messages quickly & it's located in a nice place. We met my brother here in March 2022 and there were 5 of us. The upstairs area is delightful to just hang out & visit, no tv. But the family room downstairs is nice & the smart tv is stellar! The Master suite is delightful & pretty dark for late sleeping if that is your thing. We didn't get to use the wet bar or that area of I loved the concept & would come back for a nice getaway for a couples weekend. Don't hesitate, book it! One minor thing and it's more about our own tastes and the bar stools to the table aren't very comfortable to sit on when having a full meal. They sit alot higher than the table. But we ate only 2 meals here and there were 5 adults so just giving a heads up. Not a deal breaker for us just something to note."

We loved gathering in the open kitchen to living area with no tv distraction for catching up and chatting over food and drinks. The front and back yards were spacious and welcoming. I want to have a shower exactly like the downstairs bath in my home! From the design touches to how fluffy and soft the towels are, this is one of the top airbnb's we have stayed in and so glad that it is in Cheyenne.

The remodel and eye for the smallest of detail (the steps to the master suite have a wood trim right under the step that I would never think of adding to my own home!) is impeccable. Absolutely the cleanest and most comfortable home we have ever spent with AirBandB. Way above the 5 star rating. A gem in the city of Cheyenne. Please take care of this home as you will want to stay here every time you are in the area. Plan to stay several days (we stayed a week). The Ramirez family is so compassionate and generous which made our reunion with our granddaughter and the death of her daddy easier to deal with. We will be back and hope we can stay again.

Stayed one night","One of our most pleasant Airbnb experiences. The place was immaculate, cozy, private, and centrally located. They had coffee and ice readily available. When it snowed, they shoveled the pathways (totally unexpected and very much welcomed). They were completely flexible and accommodating when we needed the place for one more night. I would HIGHLY recommend you use this Airbnb for your next stay in Cheyenne. Such a pleasant and seamless experience."

Hooking up to the wifi was easy, the place was stocked with all the basics (including a coffee maker w/ground coffee!!), and it was quiet & peaceful. The bed was a bit firm for my preference and the shower head is pretty low for a taller person, but other than that, I enjoyed my stay."

Stayed a few nights","Josh & Halei's place was perfect for me this trip. It's decorated with a bit of quirkiness so it's unique & fun. It's a great size for 1 or 2 adults, but could handle more in a pinch. It does not have a/c which I usually look for, but opening the windows was fine for this trip. I might not book it in the very hottest months. It's in a great location, turn the corner & you see one of Cheyenne's prettier parks and the lake. It's not very far from downtown or other amenities. From living nearby in the past, I also know it's a safe area. Parking was conveniently always available right out front of the unit. There are several units so keep in mind you'll hear the neighbors some but I didn't hear them very often. Overall, I would definitely recommend staying here!"

Josh and Halei also provided a list of recommendations and I must say, they did not disappoint! Did I mentioned that their wifi was pretty fast! I managed to get my schoolwork done and joined in some webinars.

Stayed a few nights","Stayed at Carolyn's bungalow while exploring Cheynne to see if I might move there permanently. The bungalow was spotless and comfortable; and stylish without a lot of decorative clutter. As a bigger person I appreciated the sturdier furniture such as the couch and dining chairs. The bed in the front bedroom was extremely comfortable and the linens were soft and cozy. The house is smaller but is laid out well and felt spacious. The neighborhood is quiet and I didn't notice a lot of 'city' noise. Carolyn provided everything I needed; and little extras like water, snacks, and fresh, baked cookies upon arrival. There are even toys and backup pet items available for families traveling with pets. The house is in a great location and easy to find. It's close to attractions and restaurants. The State Capital, museum, train depot, and historical districts, and even the hospital are just blocks away. Great location, great house, great host. I would highly recommend this little bungalow."

We appreciate being able to travel with our pups. The yard was secure and very well maintained. They were never left alone in the yard, but I didn't fear that there was trash, glass etc for them to encounter. The extra amenities for the dogs is a very sweet touch.
Carolyn was very responsive during our short stay. We woke up to terrible weather, interstate restrictions and closures. She was very kind to allow a later check out so the weather could pass and the roads could clear.
If given the opportunity to return to the Cheyenne area we'd definitely book Carolyn's home again."

Stayed with a pet","Carolyn’s home away from home was almost to good to be true. After driving across country her home was amazing! The most comfortable bedding, modern amenities. The sweet woman even baked us cookies and had snacks waiting for us. Off street parking, a place to do laundry, tea and coffee and even lotions and extras for my puppy. Not only was it inexpensive.. it was a little cheaper and better than I would’ve imagined. Just two blocks from downtown.. WOW! If we ever come through again, we will look her up again! Thank you for the wonderful stay!"

I don't think there is anything that Carolyn has forgotten to provide. The beds are comfortable. The bathroom and kitchen are squeaky clean. We've stayed at many Airbnbs but this is the only place where fresh homemade cookies were waiting for us on our arrival. It's in a quiet walkable neighborhood and is dog friendly. Five stars to Carolyn for the attractive and comfortable place she has created!

It is old and needs some updating, such as the paint touched up. The bathtub and kitchen sink really need replacing or refinishing. The finish is very worn off and I was glad it was a quick stay and we weren't using the tub/shower. For some, the traffic noise outside might be too much as it is right on the main thoroughfare through town. However, on a week night we had a good sleep."

The room and kitchen were well stocked and spotless. I think the sink is even original, which was really cool! There is a little bit of wear and tear, which is to be expected. I think it added well to the overall feel and ambiance of the room/building. Parking was very close, which I really appreciate. It is right in downtown, so everything is really accessible.

We enjoyed the location of being downtown and the quick and easy access to restaurants and the nearby streets. Our hosts were responsive at all hours and helpful in every capacity. The room stayed warm and with a kitchen it’s easy to cook. I would recommend to buy or bring any cooking things you need. The kitchen is incredibly limited with obscure necessities. The room was clean and ready to go with a great guide book with local recommendations.
Although it was a positive experience, there are a few things that affected our stay but could easily be worked out. Be prepared for stairs the room is up three flights and of the elevation difference when booking a room with a large elevation difference if can be a bit of a challenge at first.
Overall, great hosts and I recommend the stay!!"

Stayed one night","The hosts were excellent with communication and had clear instructions for getting into the building. Great spot right off I-80 for those traveling through, with close breakfast & coffee options. The space itself was a good size for two, but it could use some extra attention. The description of the space doesn’t exactly fit, in my opinion. “Retro” is used lightly. Didn’t feel the safest, maybe just because of road noise and questionable atmosphere of the building. But if you need a quick stop, it’s just fine."

The only reason I can’t say my stay was perfect is I didn’t sleep well…it was the city on a Saturday night, it was pretty loud. I consider that my fault for not thinking of it so just something to consider when booking."

Stayed a few nights","This Airbnb was very nice considering that it was an old apartment building back in the early days. Bed was very comfortable. The water was nice and hot. The price was great. The place is very historic.
The only thing I didn’t like about the place was getting into the building. You have to unlock a lockbox that’s hanging on the door to take out a key fob to put next to a keypad sensor to open the door. Put the keyfob back in the lockbox and scramble the combination. I don’t see why you can’t just use the keypad to open the door. That is a safety concern to me. Also the parking lot could use some lights. The lights on the building didn’t work either. Need to see so you can unlock the lockbox at night🙄….another safety concern. I’m sure I’m not the first person that have these concerns. I did let them know about the keyfob situation so hopefully they will change that one day.
I would stay there again cause the price is right and it was very clean."

Stayed a few nights","This place is insanely loud.
The road from the interstate crosses over a huge train yard on a bridge. at the bottom of this bridge there is a stoplight. Above this stoplight is this unit.
I won't go so far as to say tat every vehicle in Cheyenne is either a giant pickup or a motorcycle with huge pipes, but I will say that there is never a time in this apartment that there isn't a vehicle with an oversized exhaust either driving by or idling at the stoplight, often with musical accompaniment (at loud enough volume to be heard over the exhaust).
This unit's location and paltry windows were not even coming close to providing a quiet enough place to sleep. Even backed up by earplugs, there was simply no way I was going to be able to sleep here.
Also, be concerned if you think you might want to do any two of: run the A/C, use the microwave, use the toaster, use a hair dryer. Evidently the entire unit is on on 20-amp circuit.
Consider yourselves warned."

Stayed one night","I was passing through Cheyenne on a very long multi-day road trip and just needed a place to sleep for the most part. Overall this was a good stay. It was quick to get to straight from the highway. Parking was easy and right next to the building. The bed and amenities were clean and in decent shape. The building is quite old and therefore has a ton of character to it if that's something that interests you. Unfortunately, with that age comes thin windows and not much insulation from outside noise. I had a difficult time getting to bed with plenty of shouting and vehicle noise out on the street. If you're a light sleeper perhaps try somewhere else or bring some earplugs."

Had to be careful to not use multiple electric appliances at once so we didn’t trip a breaker. Also we couldn’t find the plug for the bathtub to take a bath. It’s an older building, and it’s very unique and cute. We stayed just passing through from a super long road trip. Well worth the money for one night. We ate at “2 Doors Down” right around the corner and it was great!"

The communication was fantastic and I felt taken care of the entire time. Absolutely will stay again when in Cheyenne!

I accidentally left my toiletries bag behind the first time we stayed and Cara was quickly responsive and was so great to have the housekeeper leave it on the bed for me when we came back to stay again!
PROS; Bed was incredibly comfortable, kitchen was perfect for our needs, plenty of space! Well heated, especially since we stayed on some cold nights (early Jan). It’s right in downtown so I’m sure you could easily walk to all the shops and restaurants!
CONS; None! At least nothing that would lessen the value for me! Water pressure may be a little harsh, but there’s plenty of hot water"

I should have a better feel for the age of the building, but pretty sure it is older than I am. That is not a bad thing... just something new/different for us. We found the original wood floor, original tile in the bathroom, and french doors between rooms very charming. The hosts were very upfront and communicated clearly, for example, of the electrical capacity... we had no problems whatsoever. It was very quiet overnight and extremely clean- the most important factor for me. We will not hesitate to stay again if needing a room in the area."

This was my first Airbnb experience and I loved it! The only recommendation I would make that would likely benefit others as well, would be adding some light above the entry. I found it difficult to see the numbers on the lock and it wasn't just me. I helped two others during my stay that had trouble getting in. This is definitely not a deal breaker just might be helpful for some, especially those of us with aging eyes.

It really felt like going back in time, this apartment is perfect for a few night stays or long term! Kitchen is well equipped with utensils and cooking supplies. Apartment is a little warm during the day but with AC unit on and once the sun goes down, the place cools down very quickly. Would stay again!"

Stayed one night","when i stepped in the bathroom there were some things on the floor that stuck to my feet, but other than that the whole place was super clean. There was a big loud party across the street at the beach please place that went on till late at night (around 12 or 1). We were confused thinking it was a club, but I guess it was a party. We called the police for a noise complaint. They said they would shut it down but it didn't seem like they got there before it was over. Not sure if this is a common occurance or not, but if it was this place isn't good for sleeping because it's hard to sleep there.
the AC unit was amazing. It cooled the whole place down to the chilly temp we liked."

Stayed a few nights","I stayed in apartment 32 so many of my comments pertain to that apartment only. Also I realize that when a person becomes negative, when they start to complain, that a lot of nit-picks can be brought up
I stayed in apartment 32 for 3 nights in mid June 2022.
Host used words like ""fabulous character"", ""classic vibe"" and ""old"" to describe the Murray Building. It most definintely is OLD, and looks OLD inside the apartment.
The wiring is old fashion 2-wire; there is no ground wire. An adapter is needed for all three-prong electrical cords from tenant appliances and power supplies. There is one extension cord with adapter available in the kitchen closet. Placement of outlets is inconvenient.
The tub-shower has awkward faucet placement, making it dangerous for elderly or infirm folk to set the water temperature and climb in.
There is an always-open window near the bed. The AC/heater exhaust exits the left side of the window and is sealed off. There is no pane in the right-side window, a crank only.
There is a lock-box on the first floor entry door that must be accessed every time a tenant comes in. This is very inconvenient. It gives one pause before going back to one's car/truck to retrieve a forgotten item. (I guess it's necessary though for security/safety sake. When I arrived there was a vagrant leaning against the wall in the parking lot alley. As I was making one of my trips to the truck to retrieve luggage, he asked for money. The next day there was an apparent drug deal taking place among several loiterers across the street.)
Apartment 32 is on the street-side of the building. There was lots of traffic noise late into the night and in the early morning. (Made worse by the pane-less window.) There was also a construction project underway but noise was minimal.
There is a hole 'to nowhere' under the kitchen sink. Used to be for a drain pipe I think. It should be sealed off.
Cosmetics: There is a crack in the bathroom sink. The enamel is peeling in the tub and kitchen sink.
I realize that Cheyenne is a high-rent area, however the cost of the apartment where I stayed was not worth the expense. If I get back to Cheyenne I shall look for alternatives."

We had access to the kitchen to cook whenever we needed and there was a separate shared fridge downstairs to keep cold items. The land has great views and is close to some great hiking at Medicine Bow-Routt National Forest and Vedauwoo Road. If you need to go into town it's only about 20 mins to Cheyanne or 30 mins to Laramie. We felt very comfortable and welcome in the house and had everything we needed. Communication was great and was always available. This is a great value! Highly recommended and I hope to be back in the future!

The pictures don’t do justice to their beautifully recently built home. Everything is new and sturdy. Spotless clean. Gorgeous kitchen and open layout the pictures don’t capture. My room had incredible privacy and was very spacious- the room I rented is the only one downstairs so I had the whole downstairs floor to myself. Very quiet. It’s got a private entry in a deck area to overlook the landscape. the sky is very inspiring out there. Deb and her husband Ed were great communicators, very out of your way but kindly made sure there was coffee when you woke up. Very delightful people, great pleasure. Hands down the place to stop, can’t even compare to a hotel home. Truly a gem."

Although their driveway starts less than a half mile off Interstate 80, by the time you get down to their house in the valley you have no sense that you are that close to the highway, and are in a quiet, tranquil place. Their house is amazing, my room was enormous with beautiful furniture and although there were other guests I felt like I had the whole place to myself. The bed was extremely comfortable and everything was immaculate. They are great hosts and checked often to make sure everything was perfect. I highly recommend staying with them if your travel takes you to southeast Wyoming."

As far as the host, Deborah was very fun to talk to and provided us with coffee and bagels in the morning and suggestions for stuff to do after checking out. The check in process was very easy and the communication was great too. Would highly recommend for anyone traveling near/through this place."

The Ranch is beautiful, clean and comfortable. We will never forget our stay, because we do have plans to come back one day...hopefully next year!"

Stayed one night","Very refreshing stay. We stopped here while moving from Kansas to Utah, and this place is very close to I-80 yet feels like it’s a world away from civilization. The surroundings are beautiful, as is the house. Driving a moving truck down the hilly dirt road was slightly sketchy, and the cows were intrigued enough to come close. We both had a great night’s sleep despite the high elevation (if you’re coming from a low place, be prepared for that). The host kindly prepared breakfast snacks, and the hot tub felt perfect after driving all day. If you’re near Cheyenne or Laramie, stay here."

This is my first time at this exact listing (first floor bedroom) but one of several visits to Deborah’s ranch. It is in a city called Granite Canyon, between Laramie and Cheyenne. It is immediately off interstate but far enough away that it is not audible. The premises are secure. The rooms are spotless. The price is a steal-of-a-deal. I plan to book a room at this ranch next time I travel on I-80 and need to stop around Laramie/Cheyenne."

Their property expands to offer access to a nice little (4+ miles round trip) walk through some gorgeous nature. I saw wildflowers, colorful lichen, hawks, antelope & tons of adorable little prairie dog-lookin’ dudes on my walks. She’s usually booked up, so if you’re thinkin about bookin.. snag that spot!"

Stayed a few nights","Trudy’s place is a great location in Cheyenne. One short block to a beautiful park with a lake and great walking path. A lovely neighborhood with lots of historic homes (eye candy for architectural buffs). A lovely walk to the Capitol building and Western museum and old downtown Cheyenne.
Trudy is a wealth of knowledge about both Cheyenne and the Frontier Days events. Seek her input and you won’t be disappointed.
In addition to its great location, Trudy’s place is comfortable, relaxing, well appointed and charming."

Stayed a few nights","Trudy's place was lovely. It's a great location close to everything (I recommend Bella Fuoco Pizza). I enjoyed the park nearby. Trudy has thought of every detail and there's a lovely outdoor space. It is a basement apartment so you're able to hear some noise upstairs but it wasn't anymore than I expected.
Trudy was very conscientious that I have a good stay. There was a freak power outage one night and she very quickly made sure I was ok and offered candles.
I would highly recommend this place and would stay here again."

Such fun and the people of Cheyenne were all so nice! Can’t wait to return. Check out the Diamond Horseshoe Cafe while in town! Excellent breakfast/lunch!

Trudy was very communicative the entire time. Although short, this was by far one of the best Airbnb experiences we have had. Highly recommend!"

Trudy obviously cares a lot about this place and the small details like the personal hello message on the whiteboard goes a long way especially when so many other AirBnBs I have stayed at have just been stale homes a single couch where the owner only cares about the bottom line. I absolutely loved my night here.
I should add too that the location is A+ as well."

The internet worked well and was fast, so I could still work online and use Zoom with no problem. Trudy was very friendly but not intrusive. Overall, I would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Cheyenne."

I can’t say enough about the effort Trudy has made to make the space comfortable but at the same time, unpretentiously luxurious. The shower is a particular treat and the linens and appointments are much higher quality than one might expect. Whether you’re looking for a night passing through or a longer term place to stay, I’d strongly recommend. Hope I’ll have the opportunity to stay again."

Stayed one night","Lovey little home! My boyfriend and I were traveling home from Georgia to California with a new boat and had a last minute booking. Denise was very responsive. The house was easy to find, easy to enter and just what we needed after a very long day of travel. There was ample parking for both our pickup and boat. The inside was nicely decorated and I appreciated the craftsmanship that went into the remodel. The bed was very comfortable and the neighborhood was very quiet at night and into the early morning. The black out blinds were a nice touch in the bedroom. The neighbor was very friendly and we enjoyed chatting with him. I wish I had more time to spend relaxing in the beautiful back yard. I really felt right and home and welcomed. If I’m ever in Cheyenne again I’m definitely going to book shotgun blue again."

It was nice having off street parking in the driveway. We really loved the BBQ area with the patio furniture and umbrella - we cooked up some awesome New York steaks on the BBQ!! The smart TV worked great and the couch and living room felt like home. The shower had really good water pressure and even temperature. Was very convenient having the washer and dryer in the basement, but we didn’t use it. We didn’t walk or travel by far to town, so cannot comment on the location, other than it was very quiet and nice for sleeping. Thanks Denise for everything!!"

For example, there is a lovely little park nearby we could have walked, or enjoyed picnic on the outside table, or used the barbecue, or the big screen TV, but we pretty much just used the place to sleep and bathe and keep some leftovers in the fridge because we were gone most of our trip. So no complaints at all, and a great place to stay."

Stayed one night","This Airbnb was recently remodeled within the last year or two. It has a security system and cameras hooked up to an indoor security system as well as his high-tech air conditioning. GPS has a difficult time finding the home. Upon arrival, there was a noticeable odor of what we think was smoke/mildew. We addressed this odor with the Airbnb host upon arrival and she said she was aware of the odor and they tried to cover it up with new paint. The listing states that it has Netflix, Hulu and other TV subscriptions but you have to use your own sign in. We notified the Airbnb host before arrival that we have a service dog but shortly after check out we received a message on Airbnb complaining about dog hair and that she wasn’t notified about the dog. Overall, the host was a good communicator during our stay, parking was easy, and the host was accommodating with a flexible check out which we were grateful."

Stayed a few nights","Where to begin-
Let’s start with the horrible neighborhood this is in and no outside light on for night check in! Was very uncomfortable.
No curtains on any windows just cheap plastic Venetian blinds.
Water pressure in shower is non existent I had to rinse my hair in kitchen sink.
Upon checkin we were notified the landscape was being worked on so couldn’t use yard for a family cookout —however with the neighborhood I wouldn’t either as it’s a very bad area!(Homeless shelter within a few blocks!)
Ceiling fans are in horrible condition with wiring, voltage and secure issues that are unsafe. Lights dimmed and flickered—when I contacted Denise she said oh ya I am aware of that so just use the lamp. The bedroom ceiling fan shakes and makes noises again she is aware of that but none of this was fixed!
Laundry is in a basement that is something sort of like a dungeon.
Neighborhood is VERY SKETCHY!!! This isn’t a place I would take children to! I am pretty sure all the others that claim they walked outside and such were staged because there’s nothing to walk to in this neighborhood!"

Denise responded quickly to my questions before reserving and everything I regretted not packing (lotion, coffee, laundry detergent, basic seasonings) the house is stocked with! A private driveway is an additional perk. Everything in the house worked wonderfully."

Stayed one night","5 ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️
I’m leaving 5 stars because the bed was incredible of course and bedroom & bathroom was very clean !
Assure you read the check in instructions!!
I admit, after a long day of travel , I usually depend on the host to give me a brief tutorial via email and he only gave me the door code which I thought was all I needed to know honestly . I didn’t realize there was an alarm set and didn’t know I had to park on the street so that’s my bad but the very cold demeanor in how he communicated this “ YOU REALLY SHOULD READ THE INSTRUCTIONS “ was not needed and made me afraid to even come out of the room the entire night . This was the first time a host has been like that to me and just felt he could’ve showed a little more grace. Hopefully he learns that but I would stay again for the price you pay ."

Stayed a few nights","We had trouble before we even checked in. The host’s listing offered “on premises parking” when we communicated with the host, he said “you park on the street”. We had to, for the first time ever, in an extensively long relationship with Air bnb, include customer service. Host has now removed “on premises parking” from his listing. The host’s listing also offered a “patio we may use” another reason we booked this rental - only to be told it was closed - this has now also been removed from the listing. We felt unsafe at the rental especially having to navigate an alarm system each time we entered & left. The host talked down to us & quite frankly was rude , poor communication. We have been to 57 countries & we have rented 100’s of rentals & we have never had issues with what a listing offers for amenities & what it actually has - this was a first. We have a full on 5 star rating with Air bnb. Confirm listed amenities that are important to you 1st with host before booking."

Stayed one night",Mark's place is so conveniently located for a quick overnight stay when driving through Cheyenne! His place was very clean and the bed was comfortable. He was also very responsive when we ran into an issue of a flipped breaker. He has clearly worked hard to anticipate a guest's needs and provide for them.

Mark was very responsive and flexible for our very last minute and very late checkin (Nothing like a very comfortable king bed when you're tired from hours of driving). It was the perfect place to crash on our journey Eastbound through Wyoming. We really enjoyed the western themed room. Next time we'll have to actually stay for a few days.

Stayed one night","We appreciate our stay at Mark's place. Very easily accessed from the thoroughfares (I-80 and I-25) , easy to find in the neighborhood, and entry was straightforward. Point of concern, hopefully not regular: upon arrival we did have to walk across about 30 of (not freshly fallen) snow-packed and slick walkway and driveway before reaching the 10 feet or so of cleared sidewalk up near the door. That said -- once inside, the very comfortable room and private bath is immediately inside the entry, on ground level, which was particularly appreciated. The space was very clean, attractive and amenities were great, except for the notable absence of bottled or otherwise filtered water. This was our first AirBnB stay where bottled water was not offered, and we hope the host will consider offering that to guests. Mark did indicate the municipal water was safe to drink -- but it is typical ""city water"", strongly treated, thus not pleasant for drinking. Overall, a pleasant stay. Thank you, Mark."
