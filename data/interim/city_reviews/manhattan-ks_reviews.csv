Stayed with kids","Pros- the house was cute and very easy to find in a decent neighborhood. I was allowed to check in early which was great.
Cons- the stairs to the loft felt unsafe to me as I almost fell down them a couple of times just bringing my bags up there. Couldn’t control the thermostat which then made the upstairs loft super hot even with the fan going up there. I couldn’t sleep in the bed because it was too hot and not safe for me to carry my infant up or down the stairs. There is a door leading to the other side of the duplex in the upstairs loft which made me feel uncomfortable and unsafe as I didn’t know who was next door. The neighbors in the duplex next door was loud after 10pm as late as 1am most of the nights I stayed which kept my infant up and even woke him up after he finally fell asleep. There wasn’t slippers or sandals like I expected. The travel size soaps and stuff like that most were used.
My stay could have been better but you get what you pay for I guess."

Stayed a few nights",I enjoyed my time here and everything was as expected. They were very responsive to my questions and easy to work with for check in/check out. The neighbors were very audible due to the age and layout of the place but it was not at all deal breaker for me. There is not a tv in the living room for passing time but that was a welcome subtraction which led to good conversation.

Stayed with kids","Our stay was great! We had everything we needed. There was plenty of dishes, cookware, games to play, etc. The hosts were kind, informative, and all around awesome. The only things that were less than ideal was the comfort level of the mattress on the pull out couch and the stairs. Like many old homes, the stairs to the loft were very steep with short foot beds. We have a 4 year old child so it was a bit nerve wracking. Overall, we enjoyed our stay!"

Stayed a few nights","I enjoyed my stay at Donita’s place. It was clean and affordable.
I would suggest future guests bring bottled water. There were none in the fridge. The climate control is located in another part of the home. You do not have access to this. It was 95 outside the day I arrived and a tad bit warm in the home. Fans are provided for air flow, but I was still a bit surprised by this. The stairs to the loft were really sketchy. They are very narrow and steep. I had to carefully navigate going up and down them. I was afraid of slipping and falling down the steep incline. I eventually brought my big suitcase back downstairs so everything I needed was on the main floor level so I didn’t have to navigate the steps as often. One more note, I am very sensitive to dare I say “paranormal” entities. So when I saw the upstairs closet with no door or covering over it I freaked out a tad bit. Perhaps a curtain over the door would have eased my fear of the closet monster staring at me while I slept."

Stayed a few nights","The Vintage Loft was a good place to stay. Great location to Aggieville and KSU campus while not being loud in a college town. The value was great. The only 'negative' thing that I would like to point out to others is the stairs to get into the loft. They are very narrow and very steep. I did find it a little challenging to get up the stairs, so when it was time to go to bed, I didn't come back downstairs at all. Everything else is located on the main floor."

Stayed a few nights","Wonderful place in a great location. Alll you really need for a two-night stay for a football weekend. I will say the walls are bit thin and we could hear the people on the other side of the duplex wall. However, when visiting Manhattan for a football weekend we weren't really spending too much time in the unit so it wasn't a big deal at all."

Some people might mind there was no TV, but we didn’t. We had fun playing games instead! The stairs to the loft were a bit treacherous but manageable. The only issue we had was the bed wasn’t very comfortable. It was wiggly and squeaky. It felt like we were sleeping on plastic. So we didn’t get a lot of rest."

I wanted to check in early, but never heard back from anyone before time to check in.. again a little disappointing."

Stayed a few nights","Bright side: great options for breakfast. Nice kitchen equipped with the staples. Clean and well decorated. Plenty of space and places to sleep.
Downside: Not an accurate listing. No tv, no way to control the temperature. The stairs to the bedroom are extremely narrow and unsafe. Water pressure and temperature also appears to be controlled by the neighboring air b&b. Bed is covered in a plastic liner (which is great for germs, but noisy to sleep in).
Overall not what I was looking for but could see how staying here would be great for someone trying to go to a game or hang out with friends nearby."

This place is near KSU and lots of places to eat. Little touches like a mounted extension cord near the bed made charging devices easy. Would stay here again.

Some items that I feel I should share is with this being a historic home the floors were loud and creaky. You could definitely hear anyone above you walking and walking throughout the home. The exterior walls or windows were thin as well. We could hear traffic and sirens driving by at all hours of the night. Overall for the price that we paid we felt this was a good deal.

Stayed one night","Skylar's home is very clean and in a great location! It was well decorated and she was prompt in responding.
We did have challenges getting into the front door, but was able to get in easily through the back. We also could not lock our own room when leaving - unsure why or if it was just how the lock works.
There were also some issues with the other residents not being considerate of the bathroom and shared spaces, with one person spending upwards of 30-45 minutes in the bathroom, and were watching videos. Another resident in a different room had a baby who was crying throughout the night. Then, at 5am, when people were leaving, they were slamming the front door. I have been in hostels and have rented shared rooms and this was unusual. Of course, this is not due to Skylar at all and was based on the other individuals who rented a room, so if you struggle with being respectful to other residents then maybe this is not the best place for you."

Stayed with kids","Her home is a home away from home. Skylar was very responsive . In the morning I took a walk- 3 miles around the area. Peaceful , safe and nothing that brought concern . I was traveling alone. There were other people in her home renting rooms as well, and i never felt unsafe or concerned . Make your own breakfast lunch or dinner in her cute functional kitchen. And she has plenty of sitting area as well. Private bedroom and just enough space to wind down between activities .. lots of restaurants around . Manhattan is a decent size city! Gas stations. Starbucks , etc
the price point is a blessing to our family as we have to travel so far to visit . I’m so thankful and thrilled with this little find ! Thanks skylar !"

So we see this right off in her design, renovation, hospitality, etc. But what's amazing is how egalitarian she seems.

The house was clean, a bathroom with an awesome shower, a well equipped kitchen and a gorgeous patio where we could enjoy our breakfast outside in the morning!
We would definitely come again if we ever drive through Kansas again!"

Stayed a few nights","I can't say enough good things about Skylar's place. The house is historic, with lots of charming touches. The downstairs bedroom I rented was small but comfortable and next to a lovely living room. The kitchen was excellent and very very-equipped. There was coffee and a sunny room overlooking the charming back yard to drink it in. I felt right at home. Located on a quiet street, parking was easy. Skylar and her mother were delightful and helpful. I felt very much at home and will absolutely stay there again when I'm in Manhattan."

Stayed a few nights","This is the first Air B&B I have ever used, and probably set a standard no one else will ever meet. The bedrooms, bath, kitchen, yard, sun-room were all outstanding, accessible, tastefully decorated. Full kitchen with a serious gas stove for cooking, and nice big fridge. I met Annette, Skylar's mom, who is just lovely--so helpful, imaginative, excited about helping people have a great stay. Skylar communicated perfectly, even when I couldn't figure out the keypad with an after midnight arrival.
Fantastic value for the price!
We fully intend to return, probably to rent the whole house for any family gatherings and events while our daughter interns at K-State Veterinary. You cannot go wrong with anything Skylar and Annette manage!"

-The property is beautiful and well-maintained. It's expertly decorated with a warm and modern sensibility and so inviting. I loved all the natural light and wood touches. A lot of thought went into every design element.
-There were thoughtful touches like the personalized welcome sign and fresh toiletries in the bathrooms.
-The furniture is very comfortable and the beds were the best I've ever slept in outside of my own home!
-It was easy to use the electric fireplace and entertainment center. They have an amazing menu of streaming options, as well.
-Security elements made it feel very safe and secure.
-The neighborhood is lovely and quiet and less than a 10-minute drive from Manhattan-proper. Lots of families and friendly faces on the street.

It's a beautiful house, it's very open and it was perfect for what we needed. Very conveniently located, less than ten minutes away from all the places we were going.
My messages were always answered right away when we had a question about something! It was a great stay. I would definitely recommend for someone needing a great place to stay in Manhattan!"

This classy and modern home left no need unfulfilled during our stay. The attention to detail in each room was seamless and comfortable. Keevan communicated with us leading up to our stay and thereafter. Given this was our first Airbnb stay, future stays will be held to a high standard."

Entry was simple and we were greeted by name on a sign at the entrance. The house was very clean and nicely decorated with a Christmas tree and decor. Overall the house is beautiful and very comfortable. We have stayed at a lot of airbnbs and this one was one of the nicest, most comfortable and easiest stays we have had. We appreciated the convenience and attention to detail by the host. We would definitely stay again when passing through."

Stayed with kids",You will be hard pressed to find an AirBnB as nice as Keevan's in Manhattan and we have stayed in many AirBnB's at this point! It was a nice size in a safe neighborhood and not only nicely decorated but newly decorated. No expense seems to have been spared in putting this house together! The personal touches were nice! We entered the home and had a welcome sign and some fruit waiting for us. ALL of the bedrooms were very nice! There is so much seating to eat and to sit and watch tv! We loved the open concept of the common areas. There was ample parking for our four vehicles we had there at one point as well since several of us had to come separately. Keevan was close by in case we needed anything and super responsive prior to our check in and post check out! We thought being out a little farther would be a huge inconvenience but it really wasn't as far out as we initially thought. We were able to get to most places in Manhattan within 10-12 minutes. You do not want to pass up this listing if you are looking for a terrific place to stay!!!

Stayed with kids","Very cozy and stylish stay! The house is quite charming and also unique. Clay had excellent communication and was very accommodating. One thing to be aware of is the stairway to the loft. The stairs are very very steep and might be difficult for young children and the elderly. Once booked, you can read that children are discouraged from using the stairs unaccompanied, and for good reason. Unfortunately, the loft bedroom has the bunkbeds which are best suited for children. This could make the second bedroom almost unusable depending on your age demographic. Besides this potential setback, the house was wonderful."

Stayed with a pet","Jack and Mel's home is spacious and still has some of the original features of the home (built in bookcases and the porch light switch, loved it) but with an updated bathroom and kitchen. The location in Manhattan works well for a quick drive to the K-State campus, Aggieville, and to the downtown area for restaurants. Mel was extremely responsive to questions, and helped us out when I didn't realize until after I booked that the lower basement was also a AirBnB unit (we were looking for an entire house for our older dog who doesn't like hearing noises he can't figure out)."

It was built in 1920s, so if you stay in the middle bedroom, you can hear the basement guests as clearly as if they were in your hallway lol thankfully, the 2 outside bedrooms are quieter.
Mel was always responsive, letting us know about the Air Conditioning repair guy that came over for an hour and how to park up the driveway. This was overall a very comfy stay."

We had plenty of parking very near on Colorado street as well as the spot behind the house. All three bedrooms are a very nice size with super comfy beds. There is plenty of room all around the dining table so no one is squeezed in or trapped. The living room has a big comfy couch and a large TV. Each bedroom also has TV. We would definitely choose this house next time we need a place to stay in Manhattan. It is centrally located and just minutes to anywhere in town.

There was plenty of room and surfaces to set up a food buffet and seating around the dining table. We slept comfortably that night in our queen size bed.

Stayed one night","Clean and comfortable home. Great beds. Convenient location. Check-in and communication was easy. You might notice some street noise in the front bedroom, but the back bedrooms were super quiet. If there are guests staying in the basement unit, you might hear them through the vents. We didn't know anyone was there until the morning. There is parking near the back door, but be aware that the driveway is steep and there are places that might need high clearance. We parked on the street and walked around. The old wooden floors do squeak, so if you are someone who gets up a lot during the night, be aware that others will probably hear you."

Group trip","I was prepared to give this Airbnb a 5-star rating.... it was clean, a good location and the communication was very good! However, about an hour or so before we were going to check out, I saw that I had an email from the host. The email asked that we move one of our cars so that the tenant who was staying in the basement could park their car in a spot. What?!!!! That was a shock to me and my family members who were staying in the house. We had no idea that there was someone else staying in the house with us. When you rent an Airbnb and it is listed as ""Entire 3-bedroom home"", you expect that you have the entire home, but that was not the case. The fine print stated that someone may be staying in the basement, but when you rent an ""Entire 3-bedroom home"", it should be expected that you have the entire home and they then will not rent out the basement because that is part of the entire house! So, much to our surprise, there was someone (who?!!!!) staying and sleeping in the basement of the house. Yes, there was a separate entrance, however, the entrance to that basement area was through the main entrance at the back of the house through the porch that both of us entered in. (Maybe they locked the outside door, maybe they didn't!). We could have easily opened the door from the kitchen to the porch and been startled by someone standing there inside the house that was not one of our family members. Or, we could have heard someone enter the house after we had gone to bed and not knowning that they rented the basement and had access to the home and we thought it was an intruder and called police. This person/people may have been the nicest people you could have ever met or they could have been a serial killer. The host knew nothing about me and my family and I'd assume they knew just as much about the other party in the basement. This home is an old home and the floors are very, very creaky! I don't know how they slept while we were up late that night and early that next morning with all those creaky floors and we didn't try to be quiet because we thought we had the entire house as it was advertised! We had 6 adults in the home with one bathroom so there was a lot of movement. AND, I'm sure he/she/they heard all of our conversations as there are many floor grates in the house. If the basement is going to be utilized by some other party, then the Airbnb listing should be ""Entire 3-bedroom 1ST FLOOR"". I just thought that was very unprofessional and misleading! I wanted to give this home a 5-star rating, but I could not do so after knowing that someone else was in the basement - too creepy! Just thought anyone who rents this Airbnb in the future should know that you are not actually getting the ""Entire Home"" and are actually only getting the ""Entire 1st Floor"" and you may have someone you don't know sleeping in the same house with you, entering and exiting the house and you are expected to meet their requests when you rented the ""Entire Home""... it was just wrong!"

Although we didn’t cook there, it had everything you’d need to do so. The driveway was a bit steep but we were able to drive our suburban up it and park with no problem. I would definitely recommend this spacious home!"

Literally 4-5 min away from everything and right across the street from a small park for strolling. Beds comfy too. Also a nice Shark vac that’s lightweight to clean up any messes"

We spent four nights at Mark’s place over Thanksgiving week when we visited my daughter and her husband, who is stationed at Fort Riley. Mark’s Airbnb is exceptional. It's very welcoming and very clean, with a comfy bed, and lots of extra touches - coffee, water, snacks, extra towels and blankets - all the comforts of home. What's more, Mark is one of the most friendly and proactive hosts I've ever encountered. He noticed the battery was starting to get a little low on the front door lock and reached out to ask us if he could change the batteries, just to make sure we wouldn't get locked out. We will definitely stay again when we return to Manhattan."

The place is cozy, and exactly as pictured/described. The bed was very comfortable, and there were plenty of really nice pillows. He clearly has spent the time and money to make it a nice place to stay. Mark was extremely responsive and helpful, and we had zero issues with an extended stay. We will be recommending his place to our friends and family when they come to visit!"

My dog enjoyed the backyard and grass space around the house. The home has new appliances/features that made the stay comfortable. I appreciated the security of the property as well. Would stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","We had a great stay at Sandra's rental. It is quiet neighborhood, away from the bustle of students, yet close enough to campus. The space is exactly as depicted, which is greatly appreciated. Plenty of space, and everything we needed for our weekend stay. Two things that were non-factors for us, but may influence your decision: As depicted in the photos, there are a number of steps from the driveway down to the entryway. If stairs area a struggle and you will be in and out, just be aware. Also, there is a step in to the tub/shower. I'm 50 and was a non-issue, but I know for my parents it would have been difficult. Definitely not a problem, just a FYI. Sandra was proactive and helpful whenever we had questions and needs. We stay at AirBnB's every game weekend, and we'd stay again!"

This was my first time being upstairs in the building. Unlike the downstairs units the bedroom upstairs is on the street side, which made it a little noisier from car traffic, but still surprisingly quiet on a weeknight. The noise machine was a nice bonus. I'll be back again next year!"

Stayed a few nights","I needed a very last-minute booking to get my rental tenant into a place so we could fix plumbing issues (pipe connection failed suddenly. They had us accepted and with a keyless access code within 30-minutes to an hour (so-so fast). Then when we needed to extend the stay, it was approved very quickly also. Such an efficiently run and quality place to stay. It was exactly what we needed--full kitchen for my tenant while he was displaced from his home, a much better alternative to a hotel. I would absolutely use again. In fact, I'm tempted to book for myself so I can have a research retreat to get some work done away from the demands of home."

Rose has stocked everything from pods for the washing machine to Saran wrap for leftovers. Aggieville can get pretty noisy at night. That's the price you pay to be right next to all the great downtown restaurants, bars and coffee shops. I slept like a baby because I always keep foam earplugs next to my bed (I have 3 kids). But, as a we were leaving, I noticed that Rose had actually supplied a dedicated white noise / sleep sounds machine. She really thought of everything. Equally as impressive, everything was super clean, to the glass to the plate to the fork. Can't say enough. Stay here. You won't be disappointed."

Stayed a few nights","The apartment was very clean, neat and tidy. Advance communication was right on time and accurate. Unit was easy to find. Great location. We came to attend the football game and were close enough to walk across campus to the stadium. Negatives are not things owner can control. Our bedroom was on the street side. As a result, we had a lot of road noise. We both had difficulty sleeping even though the bed was really comfortable. On Saturday morning around 7 a.m., another resident was in the parking lot playing loud music. Looked like he was getting ready to go tailgate at the stadium. Also, whoever was staying next door in Unit 7 was very noisy and partied until about 9:30 p.m. when they apparently went out for the night (Saturday). I guess I'd forgotten how rude and inconsiderate people can be."

Stayed a few nights","Every single thing was above and beyond what I expected when I reserved this apartment. First off, you cannot beat the location! Super close to Aggieville and KSU. The apartment itself is so clean and appears to be newly renovated. Bed was SO comfortable! This apartment is far better than the two hotels close to campus, and they can’t compete on value. I will be staying here again!"

The home sits high on a hill and any direction you look is stunning. The home was HUGE and more than accommodating for our family of five. It’s clean and well designed for relaxation, playing games and being together as a family. We enjoyed watching the sunrise over the lake and the vast landscape from the deck in the mornings. We also appreciated the host being so responsive and kind as we worked with them. We highly recommend this place and would love to return for another visit."

It just happens to be the someone walked down the hall every 1.5-2 hours during the night, and in one of the rooms had a new born baby that woke up several times. I was there for work and had to wake up early daily for 10-hour shifts. The other occupants made it challenging to sleep. This was no fault of Skylar, she is a great host."

The surrounding neighborhood and areas are pretty and conveniently close to MHK airport. The bathrooms are very large and the upstairs bathtub was great for a soak. Only downsides I can think of is it's a bit creaky upstairs, which I imagine could've been bothersome/embarassing if there were other airbnb'ers staying in the other rooms when I was there. The inner finish of the bathtub was also chipping a bit but it wasn't too crazy, and it was still perfectly enjoyable to relax in!"

Stayed one night","Very nice host, and nice neighborhood. All that being said, kinda tough to rationalize giving this a full 5 stars. For what it was, it was fine (being a room in a shared home). However, the vibe and feel of the house was much more-so that of a nicer hostel than that of a bnb. Bathroom doesn’t lock, earlier checkout time, no toiletries, ran out of toilet paper. It was clean, and if you’re up to that style of accommodation this listing is perfectly acceptable."

Phenomenally clean, comfortable, and quiet. Skylar is obviously a pro at making people feel welcome. I met Mom too while she was doing some laundry and had a lovely chat.
I am currently an online summer grad student and will be back next summer (or sooner) and this will be the first place I look into when returning.
Thank you Skylar, fantastic job! :D"

Stayed one night","This is a true Airbnb: it's local, cheaper than any surrounding hotels, and the cleaning requirements are very minimal.
This house is historical to mhk and is within walking distance to multiple restaurants, the mall, and kstate. The only gripe I have is that at 5'3 I was about eye level with the shower head, so be prepared to squat down if you wanna shower and are a taller individual.
Skylar always responded quickly to questions and provides a detailed binder about the area in the room so you can navigate around if you've never been to Manhattan before."
