Stayed with kids",For those with kiddos this was a fun place to hang out in the backyard and watch them play in the grass. The house was also large enough to play hide and seek when the weather turned on us. Being close to everything on main and a nearby park made it easier on us and more relaxing.

Stayed with a pet","We had a wonderful stay at Laurie’s place in Sheridan! Me and three girlfriends went for a fun weekend and there was plenty of room for us and we could have easily fit more! The house is fun, has a lot of character, is well put together and clean. It’s a little bit of a walk from downtown Sheridan, but we didn’t mind it. Laurie was great with communication and on top of getting us all of the information that we needed.
I would definitely stay here again! Thank you!"

Stayed one night","Wonderful stay! This bedroom is in a beautiful vintage home that was warm and inviting. Cara was very friendly and helpful. The home was immaculately clean, extremely comfortable. Cara provided coffee, delicious banana bread and an orange in the room. We walked from her home to downtown Sheridan and had a nice supper at Smith Alley Brewing and then topped off the evening at Black Tooth Brewing. Only had time for one night but would love to return to explore more of the downtown area. Recommend highly."

Stayed one night","Just gorgeous! I unfortunately only stayed overnight and had to drive off early, but I wish I could’ve enjoyed the peaceful atmosphere for longer.
It was SO nice soaking in the claw foot tub after 8.5 hours of driving. The bed was super comfy, and everything was tastefully decorated. So many thoughtful touches, and it’s obvious Cara takes care of her beautiful home and loves hosting. My privacy was respected but Cara let me know she was available if I needed her.
The neighborhood was cute too and close to shops etc.
Beautiful experience, and would definitely stay again.
Thanks Cara!"

Stayed one night",I had never stayed in a room in someone’s home before. This exceeded all my expectations!! Front door enters into sitting room and off of that room is the bedroom. French doors open into this bedroom. The queen bed is super comfy with great pillows. The bathroom is directly off this bedroom with great water pressure for shower or enjoy a soak in the claw foot tub. Everything was clean clean clean. There is an enclosed front porch with tons of comfy sitting places and cute lights. This old house is charming and delightful. In our room Cara left grapes and homemade zucchini bread for us and it was delicious!! Cara worked with us on arrival time. She greeted us and was an excellent host. In the morning before we left she answered travel questions for us and was an overall delight! I would stay here again and again. Highly recommend Cara’s!

I slept very well and was very pleased with my room and bathroom. As much as I liked Cara's home, the best part of my stay was my interaction with Cara. I realize that timing and other factors may not allow everyone this opportunity, so I felt so fortunate. She is a dear person. The zucchini bread was delicious, Cara. I had it with coffee at mid-day.

The bed was incredibly comfortable and the bedroom & bathroom were spotless clean.
PS: make time to learn about Cara and her adventurous soul…she’s so young at heart! Also…she might leave you a small treat to take - we indeed had a delicious treat for our road trip ahead. We will be staying again in the future if we’re passing through!!"

Stayed with kids","Tyler's place was super clean, modern and had well-thought-out decor. It felt like home right away. An excellent refuge to end a long day of competition. He knew we were there for sports and even left a few snacks and drinks for the tournament!
Tyler was very quick to respond and was really accommodating with our changing schedule. One of the best stays and hosts we've had in a long time!"

Stayed with a pet","Feel like a tourist and a hometown kid at the same time! I grew up in Sheridan and this year we visited for Christmas which was my first holiday here in over 20 years. It's a literal impossibility to have picked a better spot. This is a back unit which I found perfect because it felt like our private alley oasis. Being right off 5th Street you're quite close to downtown for shopping or grub but you're not far from anything else you might want to do.
The kitchen is fantastic but it is small. Loved the gas stove! While it is quite well equipped it's not organized like a home kitchen so maybe don't plan on making Thanksgiving dinner :) but if you wanna cook here you're good to go. And the charcoal grill out front came in clutch for the tri-tip we made on Christmas night.
As everyone has mentioned the bathroom is the MVP in the spot because the heated floors are absolutely wonderful.
The beds and linens were fantastic."

Stayed with a pet","We are driving all the way to Anchorage and have needed to find places among our route that are pet friendly. Tyler’s place was one we knew we had to book! It’s hard enough to find pet friendly stays, so we jumped on the opportunity to stay here. The space is so much better than the pictures! We walked in to a toasty space which was welcomed after the weather dropped. I appreciated the heated bathroom floors! In the morning we took the our two pups on a walk nearby and had the best time. We went to get some coffee before we hit the road and it was easy to choose because the house has a local guide.
We cannot recommend this space enough! We all felt welcomed, and felt right at home. See for yourself!"

I cannot recommend this Airbnb enough! not only was Tyler an incredible host, but From the moment we stepped foot inside, we were greeted by an ambiance that exuded charm and coziness. Every aspect of this place, from its adorable decor to its pristine cleanliness, made our stay truly memorable.
The attention to detail in the interior design was remarkable. The space was tastefully decorated with a perfect balance of modern touches and rustic charm. It felt like stepping into a Pinterest board and I photographed everything!. Every corner was thoughtfully curated, and the overall aesthetic created a warm and inviting atmosphere that was a joy to come back to after a long day of exploring.
Cleanliness is of the utmost importance to us, and this Airbnb exceeded all expectations in that regard. we will definitely stay with him again!"

There were tons of nice details, like laundry baskets, individual heating/cooling controls in every room, and my husband the cook's favorite - a kitchen scale. The only thing that wasn't perfect for me is there isn't a god place for a laptop computer since the table is in the middle of the room and therefore not near an outlet. We managed by putting a side chair across the cord so nobody would trip."

The house was open and spacious, but cozy and inviting at the same time. The host was one of the best hosts we've had, with great communication and provided additional information about the house and area, without us asking. This host goes above and beyond with the additional perks. There were pillows of all types from firm to plush, sound machines to help you fall asleep, ear plugs in case you needed those as well. Lastly, there was a fun record player and some records to jam out to when relaxing on the large couches."

Very spacious, with two queen bedrooms, living room, dining area, kitchen, laundry room, and unfenced backyard seating area and grassy side yard. Only two observations crossed my mind. Since the bedrooms are on separate floors, the basement room was about 10 degrees colder than the upper, all controlled by one Nest thermostat. The basement was also quite noisy with footsteps and running water in the kitchen or bathroom, but ear plugs were thoughtfully supplied. All in all, it wasn’t too disruptive of our stay!! Would absolutely be back."

Stayed with a pet","Tyler’s basement unit is cozy and comfortable. The kitchen is small but open so it doesn’t feel tight. The refrigerator runs a little loud, but not bothersome by any means. The heater makes a fair bit of noise when it gets itself up and running, but I think that’s to be expected as I believe it’s a slightly older system. If you’re a light sleeper, the hosts have thoughtfully provided earplugs and a white noise machine to drown out the sounds coming from inside the basement unit as well as the inevitable sounds of any movement going on upstairs.
Overall, great place in a good location (walking distance to the quaint downtown Sheridan scene).
Would gladly stay there again should we ever find ourselves on a return trip to Sheridan."

Stayed one night","This was a nice stop for the night on the way to Yellowstone. Location is amazing, I got in kind of late and didn’t have time to explore Sheridan, but it would’ve been a really easy walk into town. The bed was huge and comfortable, apartment was super clean and well stocked. The kitchen had everything you could possibly need to make a full meal. The only thing about my experience that wasn’t perfect was that I couldn’t figure out how to lock myself in (but that’s probably my user error!)"

You couldn’t hear any cars or road noise in the apartment which was really nice. They had everything one could need and it was easy to see how much care was taken to make the space perfect for each guest. The bed was so comfy too!! The place was only a 2ish minute walk to town which was great for a morning coffee and a walk before I headed out!!

Stayed one night","You will find this little basement unit to be exactly as advertised but you may be surprised at just how detail oriented these hosts are. This is a small space but it feels much larger. The decor is clean and completely unintrusive to the space. This is a big deal and it seems like the other properties I have been in lately have covered every inch of counter, table, wall and floor space with junk. This is definitely not like that and what a breath of fresh air.
One frustrating thing I find when I travel is lack of accessible outlets. This little basement is loaded with USB-A and standard electrical outlets. You will find them all over. The night tables have them built in so no need to get behind the bed or move furniture to plug in your electronics.
The wifi works well and I was able to stream with no problem. The bathroom has shampoo, conditioner and body gel dispensers. The kitchen has a small coffee maker complete with coffee, filters and yummy biscotti.
There is a bar top seating area with two chairs that serves as a table for eating or a place to work if you need office space. There are canned lights throughout the unit that provide lots of light so you don't feel like you are in a basement cave.
The unit is right around the corner from a beautiful little park that was very welcomed since my husband and I were traveling with our four-legged friend. I initially chose this because of its close proximity to the downtown area. It was 0.2 miles to get to main street and get a bite to eat at one of the local restaurants.
The listing mentions that this is owned by a husband and wife that like to travel. You can tell that they have picked the best of their stays and put it into their unit.
If you are looking for a huge house then this won't be for you but if you need a convenient, clean and well thought out place to spend a little time then this is a great choice."

The owners of the unit are extremely personable and keep the cleanest unit I have ever had the pleasure to stay. The personal touches add a lot as well! Things like extra towels for our long stay and local, freshly ground coffee, as well as personal recommendations based on things of interest. Also, one may even have the opportunity to engage with the owners as they do all the work on their units--from cleaning to property upkeep and landscaping. We were very impressed and if ever we are in the area, we plan to stay here again."

She has every amenity that you might need and some that were special touches to make the stay feel like home. It does not have a kitchenette but is set up so you can still cook some things with microwave and air fryer. The bathroom has enough space on one side to wash and dry dishes and the other side of the sink for vanity. In warm weather the private porch is a great place to read or have a meal. Some neighbors are doing construction but I did not hear them as their work hours are appropriate for neighbors. The fireplace is not actively used but candles are set up in it. Overall the room is elegant, comfortable, and very clean. I plan to stay here next month when I return to Sheridan. Thank you! Caroline"

Stayed one night","Best Airbnb ever! My husband and I are nomadic travelers and have stayed at many Airbnb’s. If we could give this one 10 stars we would. From the moment you walk in the door-Kristen has thought of everything. A small refrigerator with bottled and sparkling water; a snack basket on the counter; FULLY stocked kitchen-many say this but aren’t. Pots, pans, skillets that weren’t pealing teflon, sharp chopping knives, cutting boards, ice, kitchen towels and washcloths. The home didn’t have 100 air fresheners plugged in throughout the house stinking it up and the bedding didn’t smell like Gain. The beds were very comfortable with good quality sheets and blankets. The couch was comfortable to sit and watch TV at night. Home was not cluttered and everything looked new and in good shape. We were delightfully surprised and thankful for a cosy stay and will definitely be back. Would be great for longer stays also."

It’s nestled real close to Big Horn and Sheridan and you’re so close to the mountains the scenery is unbelievable. Richard and Elaine were also super accommodating when it came to our travel issues getting there. They were responsive and very welcoming upon arrival. They made us feel right at home. I would absolutely stay here again! Thank you again for the digs!
P.S. Be sure to check out the stars at night. Unbelievable. We could see the Milky Way!"

Stayed one night","An incredible location in a small town outside Sheridan, only about five miles from trails heading into the Bighorns, leading through wildflower meadows and evergreen groves. The house has views of the mountains from the outside tables and a quiet gazebo, perfect for breakfast and coffee, as well as a garden and a stream.. There's a nearby pizza place that looked really good (I brought my own food, so didn't try it.) The interior of the house seems like a photo spread in an art and architecture magazine (filled with one of the host's art). Great kitchen, comfortable bed. The hosts are very kind and give great suggestions for local hiking. I'd highly recommend this one."

Bed was firm but comfy and plentiful airflow via windows and screen doors if you need or want it. I think only a microwave was available for cooking - but the two local restaurants in Bighorn were both very good. The local Brinton museum is not to be missed if you like western indigenous artifacts. The collection is the best I have ever seen, focused on ornamental clothing and we really enjoyed the current Curtis photograph exhibit as well. If you like art - definitely look up this museum to understand what all is on display."

Stayed one night","Where to start?!
Elaine and Richard's place was delightful! The space was spotless, and every possible convenience was provided. I am a very meticulous person, and it exceeded my standards. : ) The space itself is like an artistic wonderland, and I wished I could have stayed another day just to admire all the beautiful objects of art and the creativity of the layout.
Elaine was such a champ, and waited up for us, as we were a bit late in arriving because of a delay in plans. She was every bit the perfect host and explained pertinent details to us.
The bed in the loft was glorious, with a fluffy down comforter and exquisite sheets. Just like sleeping in a cloud. The open windows provided a delicious breeze throughout the evening.
It was the perfect place!"

The only thing I would say is that the owners go to bed earlier so around 8:30 pm or so. We had been traveling all day and were getting in later so we felt terrible about coming in late so just something to be cognizant about!"

It was tranquil, welcoming, and awe-inspiring (we wish we could've stayed a bit longer). The place was cozy (super comfy bed & pillows) and had everything that we needed (from the coffee set-up, to the nightlights guiding us downstairs to the bathroom, and local food/hike/cultural guides). It was wonderful to sit outside by the stream listening to the many birds and watching deer graze in nearby fields. The sunset, moonset, and sunrise over the Bighorns were MAGICAL! We highly recommend their place and hope to be back soon."

We immediately felt at home as they showed us about the studio. We were glad to have had the time to learn from them a bit about the history of the area and the property itself which is just beautiful. The space is an eclectic fun spot to stay in. The creative energy was rejuvenating and had there not been places to go, I would have loved nothing more than curl up with one of Elaine's books, or pulled out some art supplies and settle in. Loved it! This is a lovely studio, comfortable not fussy and it had everything we needed. We look forward to seeing Elaine and Richard again."

the only complaint I can think of is the guest bedrooms frame was slightly squeaky. other than that perfect stay and very charming and warm, we'd love to come back"

Stayed a few nights","Great place, right off the main drag & very convenient to stores & restaurants. They anticipated every need, from first aid & q-tips to cooking & baking supplies. The front lawn was perfect without a single weed, & there were some pretty flowers planted around the porch. The dishes left for guests to use were similar to those I would have in my own home, rather than the dollar-store kitchenware I’ve encountered in many rentals. Many white rugs & linens, which made the cleanliness of the home more obvious. Cute decor & private backyard. I would definitely stay here again, & I probably will when I visit family in the area. Thanks for the use of your lovely home!"

Stayed with kids",Darrin’s place was such a great launching off pad for our stay in Sheridan. The house was spotless and had more than everything we needed in terms of amenities. The kitchen was well-stocked and the beds were comfortable. The washer/dryer was so helpful to have after our long drive. Everything in Sheridan was a short drive and my young boys really enjoyed having the park across the street. Darrin was very responsive and we loved reading through their local suggestions in the binder. This was my first time touring my Dad’s hometown and having such a comfortable place to stay made the trip even better!

I love all the decor and appliances. The coffee was a nice touch for the mornings. The house had everything we needed and more. The washing machine and dryer was nice to have for wet dirty soccer clothes. I would definitely recommend and would come back to. The price makes it affordable and much better then staying at a hotel."

We were able to give our toddler her own room and even had space to set up the pack n play for our baby in the front office which was an added bonus we didn’t expect. The space was extremely clean and the kitchen was well stocked with anything you would need for cooking. Darrin was helpful and responsive. This is a great spot and good deal.

We spent 4 days driving around Sheridan and it is easy to say that this cottage was by far the cutest most quaint property in the surrounding area. The living areas were spotless and even had treats for us when we arrived. Great place run by very nice and responsive people! We communicated a Handful of times with ease. We would stay again if we return to visit family in the future."

The location is very safe (right across the street from an elementary school) and covenient: you are just a short drive (less than five minutes) to Downtown, grocery stores, and parks. The inside is beautiful (living room, kitchen, bathroom and two bedrooms - all very modern and comfortable and stocked with supplies should you need extra). Darrin was very friendly and easy to get ahold of (they even shoveled the driveway every day I was there because of the weather). I would highly recommend this place!"

The house is well appointed, super clean, and very cozy. We absolutely loved our stay. The coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and snacks were such a nice touch. Darrin is easily reachable through the app message center for any questions you may have. The house book was very useful explaining how to operate the smart TV, thermostat, as well as the wash and dryer(so great to have this amenity). It also has wonderful suggestions for places to go visit and good places to eat. We loved contributing to the thoughtful guestbook on the coffee table. I highly recommend this stay and will be staying here again on my return visit."
