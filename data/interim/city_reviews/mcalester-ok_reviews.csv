Stayed with kids","The house was cozy. Even though there were a few flaws. The floor wasn’t the cleanest, the outside didn’t seem to have been cleaned after previous guest. Other than a few cleaning mishaps the place was a nice find. The host was nice and left great instructions and input on things to do nearby such as restaurants. We went for a Mother’s Day get away weekend and visited the Italian festival and we were happy with the stay. I would stay with Colby again. I’m sure that the cleaning was just an oversight.
Also if you are a fan person make sure you bring your own. There are no ceiling fans in the entire house. The air works great. Beds and pillows were very comfortable. Accommodations within the house were fantastic as well. Overall good stay. Just a few mishaps."

Stayed with kids","Darling house! We stayed in this house for six nights and all in all it was a great stay for us and our three children. The beds were comfortable and had everything we needed. We really appreciated the great communication, the one car garage, and the little play set out back. The only areas that weren’t our favorite were a very slight mildew smell in the home likely associated with the age of the home/humidity in the area and the pit bull next door with two puppies that was either staring us down, growling, or trying to jump the fence every time we saw her. Nice big back yard our kids enjoyed playing in but they were not allowed to get close to the fence. Not sure if there really is a risk as it appeared the dog/fence was secure but just a bit stressful for parents of young curious kids."

Stayed a few nights",Not handicap friendly. The front steps are very steep. Hard to use for the elderly or people with joint problems. The back door was easier to use but it was a long walk to the back door. There were several big dogs next door to the house which were very scary. The toilet stool was not the taller easier to use type. This was the only problem we had.

Stayed with kids","Colby was wonderful and overall the space was clean and accurately explained. But unfortunately there was a very strong mildew/mold smell that impacted our stay drastically. Three out of the four of us were negatively impacted anytime we were home. Upon getting back to my own home, my husband, who wasn’t on the trip, could even smell the lingering odor on my clothes - it was that strong. Colby was quick to respond and was unaware of the odor. All that to say, I’d recommend checking on this prior to booking."

The beds were comfortable, tv was good, there was a filtered water and ice maker in the refrigerator. The host says you can park in the garage- we didn’t use this feature for our stay because we were unsure on how to get to it. The drive way is very long and dips dramatically right next to the road so be careful. All in all a very comfortable stay!"

Stayed with kids","Great stay! Easy check-in, washer/dryer (we were an eight day stay...so that was appreciated), nice size bedrooms, plenty of room for the four of us and two dogs. Back yard is fenced, so dogs can run. Location is in close proximity to a community park, which was nice for evening walks. Colby communicated with us well and it was just a great first Airbnb experience. We actually have ti go back through McAlester and have asked Colby if we can stay again."

The garage is a plus for an Airbnb they had coffee filter available and mostly never see those; so It’s always a special trip into town for them. One bed could use a little help at being hotel comfy in my opinion. It was quiet and spacious with TV you can just watch instead of downloading an app and creating profile all that waste of time. The place was great for a weekend away to visit and hang out with the game on the tube and a beer.

Stayed one night","This was a wonderful Airbnb. We just had a quick one night stay as we were driving cross country, but really enjoyed this peaceful spot. Nestled on a small hill surrounded by beautiful oak trees it had a very nice private outside patio where you could eat a meal. It was a little hot at dinner time, but enjoyed sitting out there after dinner when it had cooled down a bit. The inside was very nicely decorated and all of the furniture was very comfortable, nice complete kitchen and a cool shower in the bathroom. We enjoyed talking with Terry and the kids who were all very friendly and communicated with Dena as she was out of town. We thought we might need to leave later than the checkout time due to a severe thunderstorm and Dena was flexible with our departure time. All in all a great experience and we would definitely stay there again if we were passing through."

Stayed over a week","We had a beautiful stay at Dena's place.
We stayed a whole month
Dena and Terrie did everything to make us feel home and when there was a problem with the water in town, Terrie came by to bring us water.
The internet was decent.
The place was beautiful and we were really happy.
But you should also know this:
The apartment is attached to the garage.
The walls are very, very thin.
The kids spend a lot of time outside and next to the garage, which also has a basketball court.
The children love screaming, playing basketball, slamming the door, the dogs can bark very loudly and you can will hear sound of loud motor vehicles mostly every day at least between 5 pm and 8 pm right outside your door.
The last week before we left, we continuously smelled gas from the older vehicles in the garage.
When the children are in school, it is heavenly quiet.
If you like to be part of a lively family,I definitely recommend this place. It simply depends on how much noise you can tolerate on a daily basis"

Lance responded quickly (almost immediately) to several questions before we booked and again for the one time we reached out during our stay because we accidentally locked ourselves out. He went over and above as an attentive, helpful host. The electric fireplace was warm, and the heat worked exceptionally well, so we stayed warm during the freezing weather. The kitchen was stocked with anything and everything we needed - and we love to cook. They even have a kettle for hot water, which made these hot tea lovers quite happy!! We highly recommend this beautiful home!"

Tastefully decorated and well equipped with all the necessities and more. Our four-night stay was comfortable in all ways. The sweet cottage was clean and quiet. We really couldn’t have asked for more. I’ve been an international as well as domestic Airbnb user for many years, and I felt this stay was more like the beginning years when hosts were consistently generous and intent on making a stay memorable. It’s spotty now in that regard, so kudos to Lance and Tracy."

Stayed with a pet","The location was easy to find, parking was simple, and got into the home with no problems. The neighborhood is a bit run down, but there were children out playing so it made me realize this wasn’t a bad location in town. Upon my inspection of the home, I quickly realized the main kitchen lights were not working. I messaged the host and they were quick to respond that they would have it checked out for future guests. The lack of lighting in the kitchen made it difficult for me to cook dinner and breakfast, even with the light on over the kitchen sink and surface light under the microwave. It was a bit inconvenient. The rooms were clean and bedding was clean. You’re able to tell they attempt to keep the bathrooms as clean as possible. Furniture was clean and I was comfortable sitting on the couches without any hesitation. Overall, our overnight stay was fine with the exception of the kitchen lighting not working - hence my 4 star review."

Stayed with a pet","Returning to this Airbnb for our second stay, we were reminded again why we loved it so much the first time. Although our visit was shorter than planned due to severe weather, our brief stopover was just as perfect as our previous stay.
As always, the house was a beacon of cleanliness and comfort, providing a much-needed respite during our journey to Texas. The large rooms and well-stocked amenities offered a homely touch, even in our short visit. Our dog Amy enjoyed the fenced backyard again, which is a fantastic feature for pet owners like us.
Despite only using the home for a couple of hours to rest and feed Amy, it was exactly what we needed. The neighborhood maintained its safe and quiet charm, and the beds, though we didn't sleep this time, beckoned with their usual comfort.
The hosts' responsiveness and attention to detail shone through once again, making us feel right at home, even in our brief stay.
Highly recommend for anyone traveling through McAlester!"

Stayed with kids","When the grandkids approve, it's always a win, win choice! The grands kicked off their shoes and immediately found a TV to watch (one in the living room and another in a bedroom) and were thrilled with the streaming options. Having 2 full bathrooms is a plus as well as a garage to pull your car in for the night. It's an older duplex, however, well maintained. Floor fans are provided as one ceiling fan is noisy and the fan portion doesn't work on the other. plenty of linens provided too, not just 1 towel per person; there were at least 2 bath towels per person. Iwould stay again"

Stayed with a pet","We recently stayed the weekend at this property and it was everything we needed and wanted.
The house is close to shopping and food downtown and within walking distance to many places. There is a Pruett’s grocery store a few blocks away and a Walmart and Pet Store not too far away.
The house is clean and well stocked with dishes, cups, pots, pans, toaster, air fryer, etc. There is a Roku TV in each room for entertainment though there is currently no access to local TV, news, or weather.
The backyard was the perfect size for our Yorkie and the owners were quick to respond when I told them of a loose board in the backyard.
We’d definitely recommend any of Richard and Becky’s properties. We will be coming back!"

Don't hesitate; book this property while you can. We stayed here en route to our new house, and left so inspired and so happy. Also, two words: game room! You will not be disappointed with Lance, his kindness/communication, or his wonderful home. It's likely we'll go out of our way to stay here again because my family and I loved it so much! Thank you, Lance!!"

Stayed one night","We really enjoyed our stay! Very beautiful home,clean and attentive host! Although I would have to say that there is literally nothing around. We struggled to find something to eat when we arrived. Another thing is that they didn’t provide any Netflix,Hulu or Amazon prime accounts to watch any movies or shows. This honestly made us very sad because we were looking forward to sitting in the living room and watching a movie after our long drive. But overall it was beautiful and clean! Amazing Host!"

Stayed with kids","What a beautiful home! We came in to visit family and I have to say the Lances home felt like home away from home. It allowed us to be able to visit when we were there and see everyone but it also gave us time to catch up with each other. Nice and quiet area. Even the 3 kids enjoyed it, they had room to play with each other or have some space alone.
Lance was always very quick to respond to any of my emails. And ALWAYS happy and so polite. Everything was definitely most appreciated, enjoyable and comfortable. I will keep his home in mind for future visits to McAlester."

This would be our first pick if we need a place to stay again!

Timothy's place was a mile off the interstate. It was clean and comfortable and we each had our own rooms as opposed to 1 shared hotel room for more money. It is for sure worth it for our needs. Check in and out were clear and easy instructions.

The lake view from the screened-in porch was beautiful and the fenced-in area was the perfect size for our little dog. It’s very close to McAlester if you forgot anything or wanted to run to town to eat. While the walk to the water is a little steep, it is doable and there is a nice flat area to set up your fishing chairs or a campfire. We spent a lot of time at the water and even caught a few crappie. Highly recommend!"

We did walk down to the Lake, it is quite steep, and some washed up tree logs made it difficult to navigate the shoreline for us old people :-) but I'm sure kids would have no issue.

Stayed with a pet","We had a wonderful stay at the lake house! It was peaceful, had everything we needed and was extremely clean. Another review said it was the cleanest Airbnb they’d stayed in, and I second that (and I’ve stayed in several around the country). We enjoyed kayaking on the lake, throwing horseshoes in the yard, cooking and relaxing. The sunsets over the lake are beautiful, and the pastoral scenes in the neighborhood are lovely. The hosts made everything easy, from check-in to check-out and were very fast with communication. They thought of everything you might need for a stay at the lake. We had a terrific stay!"

Stayed one night","This Juniper Point Lake House is truly a gem—exceptionally clean, comfortable, and has all the amenities you’d need to make yourself at home while relaxing with family. The best feature is the panoramic view from the porch of Lake Eufaula! I’m also thrilled this is a dog friendly home and although I did not have my fur family with me this time, I would love to return for an extended stay during the warmer months to make use of the outdoor areas and easy access to the lake. We had a wonderful time and highly recommend this as the best place to stay in McAlester! ✨"

The colors they chose, amenities, and comforting touches like the electric fireplace, Christmas Tree, Edison lights on the screen porch, crocheted coasters in the bedroom and the blanket in the living room made everything feel so cozy and comforting 🤗
The beds are really comfortable and we enjoyed playing horseshoes.The owners are very responsive

Stayed a few nights","This is my new heaven. We were passing through and stopped on our way out but had so much fun we rearranged our week to come back for another night! I LOVE Lake Eufala. I had never heard of it. It is quiet and beautiful. I has not been developed very much so my dogs and I explored as much coastline as we could. We loved the Crowder family camp grounds and Arrowhead state park but the most beautiful was right there down the street at Juniper Point. Do not miss sunset at Juniper Point!
The fenced in area is just big enough for the dogs to go potty but the land is huge around this home. WE WILL BE BACK!"

Stayed one night","This place is the perfect getaway. It is a steep walk down to the lake but it is breathtaking. The house is extremely comfortable and new/clean. You feel like it was built just for this purpose. Just enough space for a small family with comfortable amenities.
We fell in love with Lake Eufaula while we were here. My dogs and I swam and walked along the rivers edge there at the house but also ventured to near by camp grounds and state forest areas to hike and swim. They were all a perfect day trip but do not under estimate the beautiful Juniper Point area down the street. It is a gorgeous place to hike around and enjoy the views for the afternoon… Do not miss sunset here!!! It is gorgeous and so peaceful!!
Our first trip here was just a quick one night on our way out further into Missouri. We changed our trip so we could come back and enjoy another day here. We will be back again."

Stayed a few nights","A Five Star Experience. Most important was our bed was comfortable, we stayed in the twin bed room and had the bed made up to be a king. I sat on the bed in the other room and it seemed good too. Loved the screened in porch with the view of the lake. Kitchen has what you need to cook so you don't have to eat out. Bring your own spices and food containers for storage. There is a charcoal grill, there was charcoal and lighter fluid but that might have been left over from someone else. The two kayaks were fun BUT if you are over 200 lbs don't try it. My husband pushed off and instantly became very unstable and almost tipped over. It was then we saw the weight limit on the kayak. The listing mentions a dog next door who barks. He does, but after he sees your hanging around for awhile it's no bother and he stops. It was a perfect stay for two people and I hope we get to come back next Spring."

Stayed a few nights","Beautiful home with great views.
We rented it at the last minute, and although they were on vacation themselves, the owners readily responded and communicated well. The directions were easy to follow to find the place. It was well arranged home with sophisticated decor. Simple and Clean comes to mind. Lots of natural light and plenty of lighting for darker times. The rooms accomadated well with nice closet space for any length of stay. They did provide nice white towels (which is beautiful in a crisp hotel but at this lake I would consider something with a tad of color or pattern) hand towels, beach towels and kitchen towels. There are some games but some pieces are missing. The internet was sufficient for our use, but with the lake at the backyard who spends time inside? Especially with a nice lil screened in porch overlooking the lake and sipping wine while the sun sets!!
Now on to that.. we were a tad disappointed the the photos didn't show just how close to the road the house was and with no fence, but after speaking with owner, that was to be resolved AFTER our stay, kinda a bummer since we brought dogs and had no idea, but it will be a nice feature once completed.
The yard is a very large lot but be WARNED.. the house sits atop a very steep hill that has no steps.. you basically have to be a mountain climber to go down from the back porch or go to the front to find a more gradual grade to get to the 2nd level yard where there's a more friendlier incline. There they have a pit set up on gravel with a nice breeze that comes down over the hill. The horseshoe pit was fun too.
The 3rd or lower level to the beach is quite steep as well and has some obstacles that aren't too bad but would be a challenge to older ones or people with hip or knee issues. This is only mentioned because it wasn't clear on the listing. The Beach was nice and one of the nicest that we saw on that cove. Lots of shade and a gradual entry to the water but wear bring shoes because it is rocky. My uncle even enjoyed some great fishing too! We even got to meet friendly neighbors who came to introduce themselves and compliment the house.
Over all a beautiful place, gorgeous views, private, nice beach and pet friendly to boot.
The owners were really nice and easy to work with. We hope to go back sometime in the near future since the fence will be up. I do recommend this place, you really won't be disappointed."

I love that the house is not too big, but is still very spacious. The kitchen is perfect if you enjoy cooking. The beds are clean and comfortable. The shower has long lasting hot water and great water pressure. The only “con” of this house is the driveway being very narrow and street parking being illegal meaning only a few cars can fit in the driveway. Other than that, I think the house is great and I definitely recommend staying here :)"

Our foursome was very comfortable and it was a perfect central location for visiting family in McAlester with restaurants, a good grocery store, downtown shops and area antique stores all nearby. Robin gave us info on how to access the house in advance so we could arrive on our timelines and check out was super easy with only a few items we needed to make sure were taken care of before we locked the door on our way out. We did reach out to Robin once but our issue turned out to be a false alarm on our end - Robin was quick to respond, kind, understanding and did not make us feel foolish for the false alarm. We will definitely look to this property again for any future trips to McAlester - thank you for your kind hospitality, comfortable home and extra special little touches that put the cherry on top of the sundae!"

It was also near Eufaula Lake which I heard was good for stargazing although I didn’t get to go because of rain.
Lisa stayed very communicative with us even though it was during Thanksgiving holiday.
Overall we loved the stay so much we’d come back if we get the chance!!"

We rated low due to having a few wasps entering our bedroom through the vent system. We understand wasps get in and build nests. It happens everywhere. We have no doubt Randy will fix the issue quickly. It just made our stay a little nerve racking and less than expected. Without that, we would have rated higher."

Group trip","We loved the MCM decor and the place was clean and well stocked. The beds were comfortable and bathrooms and kitchen were nice. The living space is really weird but not unmanageable. Each room opens into the next creating a circle throughout the house. There is no front door so when you sit in the living room you are exposed to anyone walking by. Because of the way it opens to the front sunroom, air came in and caused the front of the house to stay cold while the back bedrooms got hot. Parking is tight but not unmanageable because the house sits on a business street and there is additional parking across the street. All in all I would stay here again but I would bring a curtain to block the front entrance."

Group trip","Robin was our host for a 2nd time and she never fails to impress! The home has ample everything! There were excellent personal touches including a very welcoming written message and extra items in case you forgot something from home. She provided some quick snacks for us on the table the night we arrived and even left the lights on for us knowing we might arrive after dark. The kitchen and bathrooms had everything you could need. Most important, this was a very clean and well maintained home. We felt right at home again with Robin!"

The one thing that truly stood out to us, is how nice it was that you can have adults and children in the same house and still feel like everyone has their own space. My buddies son (age 4) loved all the toys you had in the game room and that kept him busy. Meanwhile, the guys were able to watch the NCAA basketball tournament in the living room and not be bothered with the loud noises of toys and a child's IPad blaring. This will not be our last stay at this particular propery, it was everything our group needed and more!"

We did get a rainstorm one evening and sat outside on the little covered patio to enjoy the cool-off for a few minutes!!
Beds and pillows were comfy.
Would stay again!! Beats a hotel ANYDAY!!!!
Easy check-in.
One thing I did not like was Airbnb would not give the address upon paying for the house. Wasn't sure I really liked that because I was trying to have someone go check it out to make sure it was a good area. That would be my only complaint, if there was one."

Stayed over a week","10000% recommend. I stayed here for a month and enjoyed every minute. Randy, the host, is spectacular. He responds quickly, makes sure everything at the house is good, and goes above and beyond if there are any issues. The house is super homey and I would definitely stay here again. It’s also a quiet and peaceful area."

I couldn't get the password on WiFi to work, so we used our data which was ok.
Bed super comfy!

Stayed with kids","I was honored to be the first guest to stay at the Airbnb and I feel bad for writing a bad review, but I would want someone’s honest opinion.
The neighbor is sketchy. The security door is missing the handle and couldn’t tell if dead bolt was latching since it’s not on the door frame really
I know it’s an old house but the uneven floors make dizzy, nearly all the walls have plaster peeling away from it with paint slapped over it. The musty moldy smell is a lot but only to be rivaled by the heavily fragmented bedding.
The master bed is over 4’ tall. I am 5’1” and without a running start I couldn’t get on it.
The ice maker was leaking and the water
Rolls to the other side of the room without uneven the floors are.
The doors and door frames haven’t been painted in quite some time and look dirty but it’s just beat up. The bathtub has also seen better days. It’s not dirty just really
Stained.
I could have stayed at the extended stay for the same price and it would have been better."
