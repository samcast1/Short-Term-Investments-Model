Stayed a few nights","While the neighborhood is rough around the edges, the house itself is absolutely lovely! It is clean, cozy and comfortable. It had everything we needed for a weekend getaway to Hannibal. Outdoor space is very small and limited, but we made it work. We had no issues with the street parking and always found a spot close to the house. We would stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","It was a nice clean place. I stayed here 2 days for my wedding. It was super difficult to find parking and the neighbors were a little rude but that's no fault of the owner. My bridesmaids came over for 2 hours to get ready for my wedding and got messaged about "" not allowing a party"" so I think there was a bit of a miscommunication with the owner. HOWEVER if you're looking for a nice place to stay without any event to worry about I had no other issues."

Stayed with kids",This AirBnB was excellent! It is newly remodeled with top of the line appliances. The beds were comfortable. The entire house was super clean. The neighborhood was quiet and peaceful. It was located in a flat part of town. Hannibal is very hilly and one Christmas we got iced in and couldn’t get up and down the the hill at a different Air BnB. This would not be a problem with this property. This is something real to consider if staying during the winter. The water was hot and plentiful. We had everything we needed. I highly recommend this airbnb and we will definitely be back!

The only drawback (if you want to call it that) was the street parking. You can only park on 1 side of the street & it's not the side the house is on. I'd love to stay here again in the future."

I was a bit sceptic of the neighborhood at first, but it was peaceful. We were not far away from anything we visited. Spent time sight-seeing in Hannibal. Great trip on the Tom Sawyer River Boat Cruise for our anniversary! Cave was OK, downtown was full of activities. Home was big enough that we could have had another couple with us to enjoy the trip as well. Perhaps next time. Thanks, Joseph, for sharing your place with us. God's blessings!"

Stayed with kids","We came to Hannibal for the history, so staying in a house built in the 1830’s really added to the character of the trip. The improvements to the house add modern convenience without sacrificing character. The period furniture was the finishing touch. We enjoyed all of the large format paintings and live plants!
The place was cleaned well, but they had forgotten to take out the kitchen trash. Oops! Given the attention to detail the owners clearly give this gem of a place I’m sure that kind of mistake doesn’t happen often."

Stayed one night","We absolutely loved our stay at Gordon and Ashley's place last weekend. The home was impeccably decorated with antiques and great Hannibal details. The AirBnb was easy to access and was exactly as described. They communicated seamlessly, worked with us for a special request, and were just wonderful. If you plan to stay in Hannibal, you will notice that many homes in the area are undergoing restoration projects. Just two blocks away, there's a great spot for dinner (LaBinnah Bistro) that is sure to please! We also highly recommend Java Jive for breakfast, the Mark Twain cave (of course), and Sodalis Nature Preserve for a great morning run/hike. This spot allowed easy access to all of these things and more. We will absolutely request to stay there again in the future!"

The decor is well done and tasteful, looking something like a hypothetical collaboration between Mark Twain and Oscar Wilde. The high ceilings made the home feel spacious, and the plant room created a relaxing atmosphere."

The period decor was quaint and very well thought out and planned. Like staying in an art museum with all the beautiful pictures through out. Comfy bed and pillows. Spotless clean through out. Nice and quiet and cool on a hot weekend. It was just my husband and I but perfect for 2 couples. Loved sitting in the sunroom with my morning coffee. Gordon’s house made our Hannibal stay memorable and enjoyable. Highly recommend!

We had the entire 2-bedroom home, complete with a full kitchen, dining room and living room to ourselves - my only disappointment was that we were only staying one night. The bathroom was beautifully appointed with a large claw-foot tub which was an unexpected delight. We would most assuredly stay here again, and recommend it to anyone traveling in the Hannibal, MO area."

Every painting and piece of furniture was unique and interesting. And the house itself was extremely romantic. The house will charm you to pieces. It was one of those Airbnb’s that you wish was your own home. Gordon was ultra responsive to messages. Literally getting back to us in seconds. It was a wonderful experience and we will be back!

Stayed with kids","Our entire experience was excellent--front the moment we booked till we left. Rob responded to our request for a booking within minutes and stayed in touch throughout. Any time we wrote to him, we got a reply literally within minutes.
The house is newly redone and excellently so. The beds are very comfortable. The kitchen is fully equipped with pots, pans, dishes, tableware, even a dishwasher. Everything is done with a taste. The rustic theme consistently shows throughout the house. The little hallway-turned-breakfast-nook with the slanted ceiling and siding on the wall was my favourite.
The property is a 5-minute walk from one of the major attractions in Hannibal--Rockcliffe Mansion. The Mark Twain Boyhood Home & Museum, the Mark Twain Memorial Lighthouse, the historic Hannibal downtown, etc., etc. are all exactly a mile away--easily walkable even with little kids.
We spent two nights at this property with a toddler and a five-year-old. We highly recommend this property! Rob, the owner, was a pleasure to deal with, too!"

The price seems a touch on the high side until you factor in the OUTSTANDING in-suite jacuzzi and the killer location. The rooms have been immaculately clean both times, with fluffy towels too! Communication is always fast and very helpful. We will be back, for sure."

We liked the view of the Mississippi River from our room. The whirlpool tub was great, and so was the walk in shower. Everything was clean and orderly. Thank you! Amber"

Stayed one night","It was great, with the hot tub and everything. My husband loved watching the trains and walking to the park with the Riverboat. It is close to downtown and restaurants ( though none served any fish dishes, except catfish!).
Gully ( the host) was so nice to respond to all my texts with questions about hot tub. We would go there again if in the area."

Stayed a few nights","I would definitely stay here again! Other reviews I read mentioned the train waking them or keeping them awake! I did hear it a time or two but it didn't keep me awake! It definitely isn't a game changer!
The jacuzzi tub was amazing and very clean! The bed and couch were very comfortable!
There were plenty of towels and washcloths!
There was coffee for the kurig with plenty of creamer! There were 2 bottles of water in the fridge and they had a few snacks in the room as well!
The host left a bouquet of flowers for us because we were celebrating our anniversary! I thought that was very nice and was appreciated ! He also sent a text message letting us know the room was ready and told us happy anniversary!
There were a lot of places within walking distance but we didn't do that because it was so cold!
I loved the view of the river and enjoyed seeing a few boats on the river!
I highly recommend this place!"

Stayed a few nights","Excellent! Clean: even the corners of the bathroom floor were dust-free. The jetted tub inspired confidence with just a hint of the scent of sanitizing bleach. Linens - including bedspread - were all white and washable (no grody permanent bedspread). Views: The river view is better than its photo suggests. There's usually something going on. There in early August, we watched - on consecutive days - the dockings of the huge American Queen, American Symphony, and one of the Viking line cruise boats. I walked over to watch - up close - the American Queen play its calliope and cast off. Location: Most of what you want to visit in Hannibal is within two blocks - museums, restaurants, shopping. Plenty of parking, and you probably won't need to drive.
It was what we were hoping it might be, only better. Thanks for providing a clean, interesting, and convenient place!"

The history behind the inn is very interesting being originally built in approximately 1917 as a brothel."

Stayed a few nights","Aswin and Gully’s lodging was wonderful!
We stayed on a Friday and Saturday night in early June 2022. As others noted, the trains do pass by often but we didn’t find it disturbed our sleep at all. We weren’t even sure if any trains came through at night!
The room was very clean, well equipped and as advertised. We’d give 5+ stars if possible for the ease of use of the Jacuzzi tub! Location and parking were awesome - right off Hannibal’s Main Street.
Our main criticism was the thinness of the walls between our room and the other suites. This is to be expected in traditional hotel-style lodging, but it is worth noting because the antics of other guests is significantly more noticeable when one room makes up 25% of the guests per night at an establishment. We were kept up both nights and woken up early in the morning by other guests (both those speaking at normal volumes in their rooms, and those speaking at slightly above polite volumes in the hallway). Obviously the behavior of individual guests is unpredictable and totally out of the owners’ purview, and this does not impact our overall rating."

Plenty of room to walk the dogs in lush green grass, or along a short gravel road. The distant clickety-clack of a train below the bluff in the evening and birdsong in the morning. Perfection. 10/10"

It is evident that he truly appreciates everyone who books a stay there and will do anything he can to ensure a wonderful experience. From the time we entered the guesthouse to the moment we left we felt so ""at home"" and nothing but peace. The location, overlooking the river is amazing! This was our 2nd stay in the Guesthouse and we look forward to so many future visits. We highly recommend!"

Stayed one night","What an outstanding location. The river view is AMAZING, with a big deck with a long wooden bench and big table. The view from inside is almost as good, with 3 different glass doors opening onto the deck. Even on a chilly November morning, I was eager to bundle up and enjoy my coffee on the deck watching the dawn sky over the river. Clean, inviting space with comfy beds, cute kitchen, and good explanation of everything (sometimes Airbnbs can be like a puzzle -- I truly appreciated the ""handbook"" along with the little notes/signs around the house explaining things) and the special Hannibal touches. I just stayed one night, but headed back for 2 more nights soon, and already fantasizing about someday being able to bring a friend and stay for relaxing week of watching the river, the boats and barges, the birds -- and listening to the trains going by below the bluff."

Spotlessly clean, very comfortable, quiet, and with a great view of the Mississippi that you'll have a difficult time finding elsewhere. My son (11) had a great time watching the barge traffic and was almost beside himself that he could see trains at the bottom of the bluff. Liked that it was just outside of town but still within five minutes of everything. Very relaxing and secluded. The pictures are accurate but I'd have to say the stay was better than expected and Ted was always very responsive. If you're considering this listing, just go ahead and book - you won't regret it!"

Ted and Carol greeted us the first day and kept in touch with us regularly throughout our stay; very friendly down-to-earth folks.
The apartment is clean and comfortable, light and airy and even though it is located next to the main house it still felt private.
Outdoors on the deck and down the stairs are well-lit at night.
You won’t regret staying here. It’s very refreshing and good for the soul to get out of the hustle and bustle of city life."

Stayed with a pet","After reading all the glowing reviews, I wondered why no one complained about anything. Well, now I know. There is nothing to complain about! The Guesthouse is spacious, clean, comfortable, and well appointed.
There are three doors that open onto the deck. I never tired of looking at the river. Sunsets are amazing ... so are sun rises! We ate every meal on the deck. I had my morning coffee there as well as my evening wine. Sitting there was so peaceful and soul nurturing. I really didn't want to leave.
Both our dog and cat were welcomed. Plenty of room for the dog to run outdoors (but no fenced enclosure) and the cat hung out happily in the deck's sunshine.
Tourist attractions are just a few minutes away by car, as were a couple of well stocked grocery stores. Plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables as well as some good salmon that we grilled on the convenient gas grill located just off the deck.
Hosts were friendly and helpful. Communication was clear and easy.
Only one recommendation to future visitors: Use the insect repellant so generously provided by the hosts prior to exploring the grounds. I didn't notice anything so didn't use it. I ended up with LOTS of Chigger Bites. I mean LOTS! They are microscopic mites that hang out in the grass. Lesson learned by this former Midwesterner. Should have known better!
This rental is perfect for a solitary retreat, for couples, and for families. It is a GREAT value.
You will need to carry bags, etc. up a flight of stairs. Not a good place if you can't climb stairs.
Plenty of parking, and everything felt very safe. It's a secluded setting but just off the highway so totally convenient. (There is highway noise and an occasional train. So not super quiet on the deck. Indoors. however, was quiet, and we slept very well.)
One of the best places I've stayed. Highly recommend."

The place, located on a high bluff overlooking the Mississippi River, is close enough to town to take in all it has to offer, but private enough to feel like you’re miles and miles from anyone or anything else!
The space inside is very comfortable and welcoming and Ted & Carol have left several helpful notes all around to help you to navigate and find anything you need.
For us, the highlight of Rocky Top has got to be the large deck out back that looks out over the Mississippi River. It’s a beautiful view, not to be missed!
Whenever our visit to Rocky Top ends, we’re already looking ahead to a time when we can book again!"

It is super private and views of the river are worth every penny of this rental. Easy to find. Very comfortable king bed in the main bedroom; lots of extra pillows and blankets. Ted and Carol were also exceptional in responding to queries quickly. There's a little path for a short walk in the woods, a huge lawn with truly beautiful peonies and irises in bloom while were were there in mid-May. This was one of the best Airbnb experiences we've had (of at least a dozen places around the world between us!)."

Huge deck with plenty of seating overlooking the river. Very clean. Comfortable beds. Good shower pressure.
More spacious than the photos! Great communication from the hosts. Only 1 mile from town, so location was perfect & it was nice & quiet.
Highly recommend!"

They quickly respond if you need anything. We would go back. Thanks again for a wonderful experience. The Walker’s.
We drove to Ilasco 3 miles south of rental. They have little monuments there that is worth checking out. It won’t take long. We found a brochure in Hannibal Visitor Center to tell us about it."

We were worried about the driveway since it's on a hill, but it was cleared and no ice visible. The stairs had been cleared and salted as well. One of my favorite features of this Airbnb is that they provide a tower fan in the bedroom, which I use for white noise. The ambience is also so peaceful and relaxing. I love opening the curtains in the window to watch the sunrise while drinking my coffee. It's a place I look forward to visiting again!"

We were able to meet them & they were very cordial & hospitable, we enjoyed talking to them.

It’s so relaxing.
The little notes left around the house were charming and the decor is very homey. When we walked in we were impressed at the cleanliness. If you’re on the fence about booking, book it!

We were hosting a family reunion and blocked off rooms at a hotel, even though we had a block of rooms I was told by the manager of the hotel that local family would not be able to attend our meet and greet since they did not have reservations at the hotel and we were trying to host it at the pool. I reached out to Chloe immediately and she said ""I could definitely have the family come to the Stables! Chloe is an excellent host, with excellent communication with her guest. The Stables are located in a secluded area, we enjoyed a private pool, and the farm animals on property! The ranch styled decor is the perfect addition to such a cozy environment. Definitely a 5 star all around the board! I will be booking again and several members of my family have also stated they would be interested in renting from Chloe in the near future."

Chloe was very responsive to any questions we had, and respected our privacy throughout! We will definitely recommend to anyone staying in the area, and will visit again! Thank you for a wonderful experience Chloe!"

Stayed with kids","This is our 4th stay at this location, we obviously love it here. Chloe is everything a host should be and so much more. This place is as beautiful as the pics show it to be. We are very comfortable when we stay here. We come from Michigan to visit every year. As we have stayed in the Hannibal area for the past 6 years, we have pretty much seen all the nearby sights. Therefore, we don't leave Chloe's very often, other than to run to town when we need groceries. The landscaping is beautiful and the kids pretty much use the pool all day long. The pool is very clean and inviting. You will love staying here."

The pool and pool area are well kept, and it’s such a relaxing space to wind down after adventuring in Hannibal. The kittens were the icing on the cake for us this trip! Highly recommend a stay at Chloe’s if you’re looking for something off the beaten path and great for kids!"

Stayed with a pet","Stoneville Stables is an outstanding stay, and Chloe is the host everyone should aspire to. She outlined what to expect, how to check in, and even etiquette tips for those who bring pets. Stoneville Stables is a hop, skip, and jump from Hannibal - a pretty sweet location for arts, music , crafts, and tourists. Stonehill Stables was a great spot for my family and I to play volleyball in the pool and games around the fireplace. After a good night's sleep on what can only be described as angel feathers, we enjoyed coffee on the covered porch each morning. We are already planning a winter trip to Stonehill Stables to visit our sweet host, Chloe, and see how the kittens have grown! If you're looking to stay in a beautiful cabin on a peaceful piece of property just a minute from great food and good entertainment , book your stay today!"

It’s the great getaway not to far from the closest towns but far enough away where you don’t have to worry about the outside world. It’s very peaceful and there’s tons to do!"

Chloe was extremely welcoming, and wanted to make sure we would be comfortable during our stay, so I felt right at home! My kids enjoyed the pool, and probably wouldn’t have left it if it hadn’t been rainy and somewhat cooler during our trip. I enjoyed watching them from the deck, loving on a sweet kitty we decided we would call Taco during our stay. We went into Hannibal both days, and there was more to do than we had time for in our 2 night trip! We actually ran into Chloe the first evening in Hannibal and she was extremely helpful and gave us recommendations on where to visit. We had great food, lots of laughs, and made lots of memories. Chloe’s space is the perfect place to spend quality time with people you love. We will definitely be back!"

The house is beautifully decorated. This is clearly a property that Chloe takes a lot of pride in. Lots of attention to detail. I mean, even the shower was really nice.
We loved all the extras for families - games, a rocking horse, a toy corner, some baby toys, not to mention the swimming pool and outdoor play set.
Just a few things to note: the Airbnb has an open floor plan with loft. The bedroom is not a separate bedroom (it’s in the loft). And there’s no wifi/internet. However, you will have plenty of private space from the host. We never heard her, so sound is not an issue.
All in all, very accommodating host, beautiful property, great outdoor space."

Stayed a few nights","We were looking for a weekend getaway that we would be able to drive to, that wasn’t too far away but not in our backyard, and that would allow us to bring our Jack Russell dog. Luckily, we found Stone Hill Stables situated between the towns of Hannibal and Palmyra, Missouri.
Stone Hill Stables is quiet, peaceful and away from the hustle and bustle of town, but close enough to both Hannibal and Palmyra that you are able to go to a restaurant, shop or visit the local sites if you should choose. But, it also has the amenities that make it so that you don’t have to go anywhere if you don’t want to.
Stone Hill Stables is a welcoming place. When you walk in the door you instantly feel at home with its rustic charm. The cabin is small and attached to the owner’s home, but it is well appointed with all the things you need to stay for a weekend or a week. Lest you be afraid of noise, we heard nothing on the other side of the walls. It is very family friendly even though we didn’t bring any children with us. The cabin was comfortable and everything worked! Have you ever walk into a place and you couldn’t figure out the tv or the microwave? Believe me, it has happened to us. Not here. The dish tv was very self-explanatory and worked from the start. Also, our hostess, Chloe, made sure it was nice and cool on a very hot day. The kitchen is not full sized, but you don’t really need one. Who goes away to bake a cake?? And, even if we had wanted to, Chloe offered her oven if we needed it. There is a gas grill for your use that we did take advantage of. A word of warning to those who have teenagers attached to their phones, there is no wi-fi. This is a great opportunity to come and unplug from the world!
Outside, there was a wonderful swimming pool and a beautiful deck that just calls to you on a hot day. There are horses and a donkey. We even had a small, gray kitten check us out. And, let’s not forget the friendliest dog ever. There is a swing set for children to play on. Believe us, everything was well thought out here for the full family experience.
You want to see the local sites or eat in town? Chloe left informational pamphlets to help make those decisions.
Chloe was a wonderful hostess. She was in contact with us and made sure to let us know she was always able to be reached should we need anything. She was very friendly and willing to get us anything that we felt we needed.
We had a great time at Stone Hill Stables and would have no problem returning."

Stayed a few nights","I really enjoyed my stay at Anna's place. Beautiful, very spacious apartment, spotlessly clean, lovely living area. Loved hanging on the couch and especially loved the comfortable king bed with soft linens and a luxurious amount of pillows. I slept great. Shower has excellent water pressure and SO nice offers both a rain showerhead and a handheld.
Palmyra is a quiet and mellow location. I arrived at night and Anna was so thoughtful to leave lights on for me and helped me out when I couldn't find the house in the dark. I would definitely come back.
PS great location for exploring Hannibal or Quincy, and don't overlook Palmyra itself, lots of historic architecture here too!"

Stayed a few nights","Anna’s place was lovely and peaceful, and the amenities were just as described. The space was aesthetically very nice and spacious, and it was a great value for the price! We were able to cook easily, the bed was very comfortable, and it was a quiet location. Anna was very responsive to questions and proactive with communication. The only thing that made me give 4 instead of 5 stars was that there was a slight musty smell in the living room, which got a little bothersome if you were in that room for a longer period of time. I’m guessing this was just due to the age of the house. Other than that, everything was great, and I would definitely recommend!"

Surroundings were gorgeous and so peaceful. The 15 to 20 minute drive to everything we wanted to do was scenic. We nearly managed to arrange horse lessons, but decided against it. Owners were kind and left lots of suggestions for food.
Beds were good, not great, pretty soft/bouncy. We slept well!"

WIFI was strong and perfect for steaming movies for family night! Kylee’s hospitality was inviting and kindhearted! Kylee even provided a portable crib, highchair for my baby; and various games/toys for my kids leisure. Her children were also very friendly and kind. They let my kids assist with feeding the animals on their farm and also gave my kids horse rides on their beautiful & well trained Mare, Birdie. The little tourist town of Hannibal, with the Mark Twain Caves is a short 10-15 minute drive away, making the location perfect! Thank you so much for sharing your homestead and contributing to the memories my family will cherish in their hearts forever!

The large washer/dryer was great after having traveled many days. We look forward to returning and spending more time here. Host was very accommodating when we needed to check in a bit early.

Stayed a few nights",Very peaceful and quiet. Christmas themed and our kids got to open presents by the tree. That was my most favorite part! Their dog Sadie was such a gem to my boys. They loved playing with her. The snow made it so much more magical with the hills. The home was open spaced it felt breathable. We were able to wash our laundry so comfortably and it wasn’t loud. The wifi was fast. I thought the journal for guest to write on was such a cute idea. They provided more than enough toiletries and towels. The king bed is cozy! She was such a great host! Beautiful home!

It took us straight down to Main Street off seventh near all the town happening s. Rob was constantly Checking in with us to make sure all was well. It was easy access to get in and out.

Stayed with kids","We purposely chose to stay at one of Rob's properties in Hannibal, Mo., because we were in one of his houses last year, too. This time, just as before, we were very satisfied with the whole transaction: from the booking and confirmation, through the pre-arrival communications (Rob is so very much on top of his e-mails/messages--we usually get a response from him within just a few minutes' time), the place, the cleanliness, everything.
Both properties we have stayed at were clean and done/decorated with taste. If you are with little kids, though (or big but clumsy ones), I would recommend gathering up the decorative vases, figurines, etc., that are so artfully placed throughout the house, and putting them away because they are prime targets for the curious little hands.
During our second stay, a very minor maintenance issue arose. Rob had a handyman come over within half an hour of messaging him about the issue which was also fixed within minutes.
Great experience both times!"

The home is charming, clean and comfortable. The hosts are accommodating and friendly. Any issues that we had were dealt with immediately. The beds are super comfy. There is a lot of space to spread out. There are family games and media options. We would definitely stay at this Airbnb again if we ever went back to Hannibal.
Note to self: bring my own food to cook next time, since Hannibal apparently doesn’t have good food options."

We particularly liked Java Jive - great coffee and ambiance. Loved the riverboat ride and tour. What was most outstanding were the people. From beginning to end they were kind, thoughtful, helpful and creatively and passionately vested in their community and in putting their best foot forward. I would happily return to the Rose Cottage and Hannibal."

The home gave us both our privacy and great areas for visiting and catching up. The enclosed area behind the house with the fire table was perfect. They messaged us a few hours early to tell us that the home was ready whenever we were. We were within walking distance of Mark Twain's boyhood home, restaurants, and shops. The place had everything we needed and was very clean and well decorated. Very comfy. They left nothing to be desired. They left us some very thoughtful welcome gifts. We never had a need to reach out to them. Everything was great. Thank you!!!"

Stayed with kids","We had a great visit to Hannibal. John and Sharisse were very helpful. The cottage is adorable and we loved being close to main street so we could go out and walk around, then come back for baby's nap time, and leave again after he woke up and had been fed. The cottage is full of cute little special touches. We thought the beds were comfortable. Loved the complimentary snacks and wine and the back patio is beautiful!
The one thing that we were concerned about was that the train tracks are close and there is traffic. We were worried our 8 month old would wake up a lot. We put him in the back bedroom and he slept like an angel! Definitely was worth it so that we could do more and didn't have to load him up in the car every time we wanted to go out.
Next time we find ourselves in Hannibal, we would love to stay here again!"

The Rose Cottage itself is a beautiful, charming house located right at the end of the main drag in Hannibal. We were able to park outside the cottage and walk to just about anywhere in town we wanted to go. Bars, restaurants, tours, cute boutique stores, and (if you need to get your steps in 🤣) the steps leading to the Mark Twain Lighthouse. It was clean, private, and they supplied everything we may have needed for a weekend getaway, including a nice propane fire table which we used while drinking the wine they left for us to enjoy!
We're talking about a return trip this summer, and if we do, we'd definitely stay at the Rose Cottage again!"

Stayed with kids","The cottage was clean, comfortable, and perfectly situated for exploring downtown. I watched boats and trains pass on the other side of the levee, did some people watching from the front porch, and climbed the hill to the Hannibal Lighthouse above the cottage. However busy the traffic downtown, we always found parking in front of the cottage. By evening, the cottage was quiet and peaceful, despite any passing trains or local traffic (which really was sparse at night). The back patio was charming and private, like a secret garden behind the house. The beds and the furniture were comfortable. We used and appreciated the Keurig coffee maker, the retro fridge, the icemaker, television, and especially the birthday balloons for my daughter and anniversary gift for me and my husband. I would absolutely stay here again. I have been to Hannibal many times, and never had as pleasant a lodging experience as this."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I just wanted to get away and we didn't want to drive for hours. We live near Hannibal, MO. I saw the room online and thought it would be worth it just to stay in that room, and the room did not diappoint. I cannot believe the attention to detail that was put into the room. The wood seems to have been from an old barn, which Barb cleverly displayed a picture of in the kitchen. The claw foot tub was a fun experience, and the ceilings were beautifully done. The locks were easy to use and required no key from us, which I appreciated a lot! We had a great time walking around downtown Hannibal and shopping. The local restaurants also did not disappoint. I would love to chat with Barb sometime and hear the stories of how she renovated the room (not to mention the other rooms in the building!)! Thank you for such a memorable stay! We loved it!"

The only downside was that multiple trains came through town and sounded their horns very close to our windows. This happened between 10-11 pm but then I never heard another train. Barb did provide ear plugs, so there is a potential remedy. I would still stay here again when I visit Hannibal."

And the unique window shades, or doors rather, were a unique touch (among other things) and effective at keeping the room dark. Be prepared to take your luggage up a couple long flights of stairs. Outside it's a very walkable area but we were there New Year's Day so most places were closed until the next morning. Shout to to Jet's Palace for being one of the only places open and an excellent take-out experience and to Barb for the bottles of prosecco for New Years! We only stayed the one night while passing through and the following morning was foggy, so we were limited in what we could see and do and kinda wished we were there longer."

I would stay here again and hope to in the summer months to do some hiking in the area. If you want to stay in a unique older building that was been updated with all the amenities you could want this is the place to stay. There is an active train crossing nearby so if that noise bothers you the listing is accurate that this might not be your spot.

Barb and Pattee were wonderful hosts—I messaged them with a few questions before booking, and they responded very quickly with tons of helpful information. Parking and check in was very easy, and once we saw our room we were blown away! Barb and Pattee have clearly put tons of love and care into every aspect of the room—the suite was incredibly comfortable, and there were so many thoughtful small touches that made our stay a delight. Just a few examples include: yummy snacks in the room, chilled wine glasses ready in the freezer, coupons for the delicious coffee shop next door, and umbrellas conveniently placed in the hallway in case of rain! In addition to the comfort and amenities, the location of the Travelers Rooming House really can’t be beat—it’s right in the middle of town within easy walking distance of all the main attractions. Our weekend flew by with all of the fun activities in Hannibal—we were hoping for a relaxing, fun, easygoing trip, and that’s exactly what we got! Thanks so much, Barb and Pattee, we hope to come back soon!"

You'll feel like you're in a beautifully crafted wood cabin a million miles from anywhere, only there's a fascinating historic downtown area on your doorstep. The suite is very spacious and cozy, we had everything we needed for a relaxing stay. We booked at short notice and everything was easy, even the parking. Communication was excellent, the staff were kind and we felt very well accommodated."

Stayed a few nights",Cute place in old downtown historic Hannibal. The room was greatly appointed with everything you would need for a weekend getaway. They even had vouchers for the coffee place downstairs. Our suite was on the top floor overlooking Main Street which was cool. The attention to detail on the remodel of the place is impeccable. The only downside I could see is the stairs are kinda narrow and steep. We will definitely be back to stay again.

We loved it being on the main strip of Hannibal but that did add a little street noise and train whistle when it was time to sleep. However, THAT'S the experience that this little, quaint downtown Hannibal offers. You will enjoy this third floor apartment meant to be a step back in time. Lovely, lovely place. 👍"

Super clean! High end bathroom products!! Just some things to be aware of: There are two flights of stairs to go up with your luggage. There is a train track along the river very close and the train came through during the night three times making its presence known!! Lol We weren’t bothered by either of those, but some people might be. Amazing host!! Definitely want to go back!!"

While every bit of this stay included modern day comforts - complete with high-end luxurious bedding, blankets we melted into, bath mats that made us want to dance our way out of the claw-foot tub, a three-tiered tray with a mix of snacks, local sodas and candy, a coffee maker with fresh beans from Java Jive next door, bath and hair products that were spa-worthy, a hair dryer and straightener in case we wanted to fancy up before the Mark Twain performance, and a giftwrapped toothbrush and toothpaste for each of us, our imaginations ran wild with all that must have happened in this beautiful building and our amazing room. The painstaking rehab that was done to bring this historic building to its modern day glory is so appreciated, and will be remembered long into our future."

The only downside is that the bedrooms didn't really match the description. There is really only 1 bedroom that had two beds in it. The 2nd ""bedroom"" is just bed on the landing at the top of the stairs that you pass through to get to the actual bedroom. The 3rd ""bedroom"" is just a sofa that can be laid flat in the main living area/kitchen. This was perfect for our family as we didn't need the privacy, but if we were expecting private spaces it did not exist.
Overall, we still give this amazing place 5 stars. It felt cozy, clean, cute and very comfortable to stay in. We would love to stay there again if we are ever in the area!"

It does have an ambitious amount of stairs to 2nd floor but was not hard for someone who has no problems with steps. I do caution people about the upstairs thresholds which are higher than what most people expect could be a tripping hazard. The kitchen was clean with dishes available to use full size stove and fridge. A nice table for dining right near kitchen. The bedroom was huge!! it gave it a historical feel. if you go thru this way again would stay here.

Stayed one night","Anna’s place was charming and clean, and well situated for our travels between NE Iowa and central Missouri. We arrived during a heatwave, but the air conditioning was robust and effective, even on the second floor of this very old building. We enjoyed a nighttime walk around the surrounding area — so many lovely old houses! My only warning would be to folks who don’t do stairs well, as there are lots of them — and both toilets are on the ground floor, so if you need to use one at night, it’s a bit of a walk."

I slept downstairs- the bedroom upstairs is massive and could easily have another bed or couch. The bed was comfortable and the shower nice and warm. The town was neat to explore - and I enjoyed walking the nature areas down in Flower City Park.

Stayed with kids","Pros:
~ Extremely clean, even though the home is over 100 years old
~ Bed in the bedroom was very comfortable
Cons:
~ The main bathroom is *in* the kitchen/dining room. It doesn't feel like a separate room because the walls don't go all the way to the ceiling. There is about a 2-foot gap above the bathroom dividing wall. This means that everyone at the table (6-8 feet away) can hear (and smell) everything that's happening in the bathroom. That was a bit disconcerting. The latch on the bathroom door hardly catches either, so if someone comes (like a small child) and leans on the door, it comes open.
~ The bedroom walls are in need of repair. I think they're going for a shabby/chic look, but it really just looks like they ran out of time to repair the old walls. My 1 ½ year old was pretty scared of the room."

The home is located on Main Street, and it is very easy to walk to local restaurants and a new coffee shop called Carter’s Coffee - definitely a must-visit!
Side note for older or mobility-challenged visitors: the stairs to access the bedroom in the home are very steep, and the bathrooms are on the first floor, so going up and down the stairs might be a challenge for some individuals."

Stayed a few nights","This place worked out excellent for me as I was working nearby and helped me lessen my commute to my customer. The price was actually less than what most of the hotels I usually stay in charge per night for much less of of a room and space. This apartment is has a rustic appeal while also having very up to date features. Very cozy place for a couple, and maybe those with a young child or two.
The only complaint I personally could make is that I am getting up there in years and climbing stairs to get to the bedroom began to get somewhat painful after also climbing up on ladders at my customer's site all week...but that is just me and my old knees."

I didn’t realize it wouldn’t be in a bedroom also, so just mentioning it’s not a private space. Sorta private, but not really! It’s also a little warm in that space. Window AC in bedroom worked great. Downstairs (main floor) was cool and the bed/sofa there was comfortable. There is a door on that space that you could close and make private if you wanted. At first, we didn’t notice the second restroom. It’s under the stairs (toilet/sink only). Just down the street were restaurants we walked to. Glad we stayed here. Would recommend."

The apartment is very clean and well stocked. Our family of 4 didn’t lack for anything! Spacious rooms complete with board games which kept the kids entertained. Highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","This cute duplex was just as shown! Super cute and clean. The weather was perfect for sitting on the front porch a couple hours & chatting. My husband learned a new term ""shabby chic""😄. I loved the fresh bag of ice in the freezer instead of ice trays that are who knows how old😬 Visited Hannibal one day and Quincey the next, then went back to Hannibal as there wasn't much in Quincey, especially on a Sunday. Really can't say enough good about our stay at Anna's!!! Highly recommend❤️"

Stayed with kids","Lovely, peaceful, restful place to stop for a good night’s sleep while on the road. Host is super responsive and helpful. Beds are sooo comfy! Heads up that the full bathroom’s walls don’t reach the ceiling (“loft style” open floor plan), but the 1/2 bath is fully enclosed for privacy. Families with kids will love Flower City Park for the multiple playgrounds and room to run off some energy! Town is super small but close to Hannibal for touristy things, and this home is easy to find — just a couple of blocks off the highway."

Stayed one night","I was visiting Hannibal, MO to see the Mark Twain exhibits and was pleasantly surprised by the various shopping and curiosity shops there. My drive back to Anna's house was only about 20 minutes and it was a clean, quiet, warm house. I rested and then ate at the Rebel Pig which is about a 5 minute walk from the house. The food was very good and the I talked to the locals, who were very friendly and made me feel at home on this solo journey. The stay was simple and exactly as stated in the ads."

Stayed with kids","Anna's space was definitely better than described. The unit was spacious and clean (also noticed the amazing scent of the unit!). It is a beautiful mix of modern and shabby chic and we loved it! Extremely comfortable beds, high end bedding (duvets, memory foam). Temperature regulation throughout was easy and very comfortable. Kitchen contained all we needed. Space was bright and cheery and we loved the front porch. We went to see Hannibal and Mark Twain home. This was just a short drive from above. We ate at a fantastic Mexican restaurant in Palmyra, also recommended! Anna made every step of the process very easy and we would definitely stay again. Our family of 4 was very comfortable staying here. Thank you Anna!"

Stayed one night","We LOVE Anna! She is awesome.
The house is absolutely the best Airbnb that we have ever stayed in. It's beautiful, clean, spacious, and homey.
All the amenities are perfect. The sunlight falls through the windows like liquid gold in the morning.
The radiant heat in the master bedroom is a definite plus.
My husband wouldn't let me get away without saying this, but he insists that ""the bathroom in the closet under the stairs should be called the 'Potter Squatter'"" 🙄😂
Thanks for giving us such an amazing experience. ♥️🌻"
