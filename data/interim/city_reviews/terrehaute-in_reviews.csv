Stayed a few nights","Mark is an excellent host. He went above and beyond: he got a ramp to get in the home, I have mobility issues; he offered to help get our things into the home; we had issues with the lockbox and there was someone right there to help. I am very concerned with cleanliness, Mark's home made me feel comfortable!
When I had questions prior to our arrival as well as during our stay, Mark responded very quickly.
My friend and I were in town for the Covered Bridge Festival. If we ever go again, we would definitely stay here. There are tons of places to eat and shop.
I can't sing Mark's praises enough! Great host."

Mark the host was very nice and stayed in contact to see if I needed anything.
It was such a relief to not hear slamming doors from hotel hallways or the portable window air conditioner cycling on and off keeping me up and awake all night.
Such a relief to get a full nights sleep while on vacation!! Thanks so much!👍🏼👍🏼"

Stayed with kids","We are in Terre Haute a few times a year when visiting family and this Airbnb location is our new favorite place to stay. It's clean, quiet and was near where we needed to be. Nothing fancy, but I'll take a quiet neighborhood and a clean, roomy place over a cramped hotel room or a loud area. My son enjoyed the big TV and access to all the video services and my wife enjoyed coffee on the patio in the mornings and that there was a fan available for white noise at bedtime. It was also nice to have a garage available for parking if we needed it. Arrival was simple and easy and Mark was quick to respond prior to our trip."

Stayed about a week","Marks place made me feel safe and comfortable. It was nice to know the people next door are Mark's family. They were very helpful and kind. It is a nice neighborhood. It was very clean and convenient. We loved the personal garage that we could actually open remotely, pull the car right in, and then walk directly into the house from the connecting door, which made it very convenient to take our things into the house. A beautiful large yard with a frisbee stand and patio furniture. Yes I can recommend staying at Mark's place. Sheila and Buddy"

I joked with my wife that if she ever left me, I would look into moving and renting this place. The bed was super comfortable.
I loved being able to hear the trains in the distance. Was quiet and peaceful. We had only ever passed through Terra Haute, we had no idea the variety of food places to eat out.
We had an awesome breakfast at Cackleberries, service and food was awesome!
No complaints and highly recommended this place."

We were traveling across the country from California and were very road weary, we got in late and it was such a relief to relax in this great space separate from the owners residence, decorated so beautifully with so many personal artistic touches.
Since we were traveling the week of Christmas, it was decorated better than my own home! A little Christmas tree in the living room, and other Christmas lights in our bedroom and a beautiful Christmas candle arrangement. There were also Christmas cookies on a plate waiting for us, which my husband was delighted to enjoy!
I highly recommend this wonderful host and safe haven. We are passing through again. We definitely would love to stay here! Thank you!"

With a ramped entrance, it also has its own outdoor deck overlooking a pretty yard. Actually, the apartment is even prettier in person and appears quite new. The bed and living room seating are very comfortable. We had a car issue that delayed our arrival, but Annette was understanding and helpful. We look forward to staying here again."

The ceiling is so high it feels a bit like sleeping in a castle turret & I mean come ON who doesn't want to experience that vibe at some point...
The porch has a ramp, too, so if you use a wheelchair this might even be accessible! It's kinda' short & narrow, but since most places don't consider this at all it bears mention."

A/C works great. It only has a small fridge & microwave (which was fine for us & as described). She left us a drawer full of snacks which hubby enjoyed! Lol

Nothing was bad, so not trying to pick, but the water pressure was a little low and one bedroom is a little small. But, the good is so good! Immaculate and attention to detail. The house is excellent for the number we had (7), plus our daytime visitors (6 more). The open dining/kitchen/living area is large and comfortable. The view is amazing. The amenities are perfectly thought out. The hosts have really attempted to think of everything. No details were overlooked. Every door worked, every switch, every appliance, worked. The paint and trim were good, the cleanliness was perfect. This was absolutely the cleanest and best kept property we - or anyone in our family - has rented. So well kept and organized, it felt like home the moment we arrived. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend this property and the hosts."

Family traveled from Fl, NC, GA and some still live locally. It was the perfect place to get everybody together to remember dad and to catch up! If we gated in TH again we hope this place is avail!

We enjoyed having access to the boats and life jackets as well as some games and toys. The small beach provided entertainment for my youngest. If you're serious about fishing, bring your own poles and tackle as what was available needed some work. It was a relaxing getaway for my family, and all ages had a good time."

They’ve thought of everything and the kitchen was more stocked than my kitchen at home. The view was spectacular. It was private and peaceful and we basically had the entire lake to ourselves for fishing and kayaking. We had teenagers and a young one and all had a great time. We used instacart and DoorDash to this location no problem. If you’re looking for a place to relax and slow down but still want luxury and comfort this is your place. Thanks Thomas and Meghan! We will be back!

The house is always very clean, fully stocked and everything is easy to find There’s a great place to sit outside under the porch and a bench by the fire pit and recently added is a log to sit on right next to the river. This time we met Billie’s husband, what wonderful man. We had a couple great conversations and learned a little history about the area. He was also telling me about the storms on July 4th and the tree that fell. Also that he brought down window air conditioners and a generator for those guests until the power came back on. This is a great place to stay with some really great hosts!!!"

a terrible storm had electrical lines down All over the city of Terre Haute, trees were down and even hotels did not have electricity.

The house was exquisitely clean!
I wish I could have given it 10 stars and I would have. Everything was absolutely perfect and it was a lovely spot on the river.
Billie made sure we had everything we needed!
Fortunately, our power came on a few hours after we arrived, and John came and removed the generator and removed our window units.

Stayed over a week",John and Billie made sure our stay was comfortable and were very responsive to inquiries. We had the best snowy view of the river which made our wintertime stay very enjoyable. This was a nice getaway from the busy streets and made post surgical recovery a wellness retreat. The kitchen was well stocked with utensils and appliances for our 26 days.

There are pictures of covered bridges throughout the house and both are pretty close to visit and I highly suggest visitors check them out. Although the GPS doesn’t take you right to the house if follow the directions from Billie it is really easy to find. We are already planning our next adventure in this house!! Book it and enjoy it!!!!

The host was very friendly and was quick to respond to emails. Check-in was easy. Other reviews mentioned that the house was tricky to find, but we used Google Maps and it took us all the way to the house without any problems. The host will send you detailed driving directions before check-in though, just in case your GPS system isn't as accurate.
All in all a very nice place. I'm sure we will stay here again."

Billie's attention to the little details was one of the things that truly made the stay special- from the luxury hand soaps to the cozy towels. The shower head in the master bath is AWESOME!!!

Stayed a few nights","Where do I start? Ah-mazing place!!! If you get the chance to stay here, DO IT!! Billie's place is incredibly clean....beyond sparkling. The entire space is wonderful but, most important, ALL of the beds are super comfortable! Tons of hot water, a well-stocked pantry and all of the sheets and towels are scented! You may not think this touch is important but, after a very long day, a hot shower and a fluffy towel then snuggling into a fresh bed is heaven! Oh and the view is to die for! Nature everywhere! Jumping fish in the river, lots of birds. I can imagine it is challenging to find this little gem in the dark of night but we made a point of arriving during the day and only had to turn around once:) Once you know where it is, it is SO convenient! It feels like your out in the country but there are chain stores less than 2 miles away. We will definitely stay at Billie's place if we are ever in the area again!"

Stayed a few nights","Was very pleased with this house. Stayed here while visiting with my son who is at Indiana State University. It is only a few minutes from campus. As another person shared in their rating, the house was nicer than I anticipated from looking at the pictures. Very cute decorations (quilts, rocking chair, covered bridge photos). We had a beautiful sunset that we could see from the house one of the nights we stayed. It was very peaceful to sit outside and watch the river. House was well stocked and was very clean.Beds in the bedrooms were very comfortable. When we had trouble with the TV, hosts quickly responded they would come help, but we figured it out before they got there. On the downside, even though we were notified that the GPS would not route us correctly to the house, we got a little lost following the directions emailed to us by the host. Once we knew where the house was, it was a breeze to locate. Would stay there again on another visit."

The location is better than it appears in the picture, the river felt closer than it looked online. Billie's place was spotless and had tons of comforting touches. I think with AirBNB we all expect ""home away from home"" and Billie's place meets (if not exceeds) that relaxing expectation. Billie's place was close to a ton of attractions and not far from IU."

Our dogs loved the fenced yard! Travis provided lots of amenities like candy, bottled water, dog bags, etc. The only suggestion I have would be to try to lubricate or replace the bed frame in the back bedroom - any little movement resulted in a creaking noise, which woke us up some at night. Otherwise, it's a great little house for a Terre Haute visit!"

But a great stay and better than hotel as traveling to see family and area and this was the midway point to travel farther south.

Didn’t realize until I got home and Travis was willing to ship it to me but my brother was still in town at a campground with his family and Travis got my pillow to him for me. Pillows aren’t much money but it was mine and he made sure I got it back. Great stay. Thanks.

Things happen, and I understood, so it was nice he was so receptive and prompt. I travel with my bulldogs so this could’ve taken a bad turn, and I felt to be in good hands with Travis managing the property and repair."

Stayed a few nights","Well folks, if you’ve ever wondered what excellence was like, stay here for a couple nights and you’ll never look at other Airbnb places the same. From the rapid, clear communication to the clean, quiet house to the beverages/snacks, games/books to the fully stocked kitchen, everything about this stay broke the 5-star system. AC was cold but quiet, fenced in backyard if you bring your dog and no noise from interstate or busy roads or wild neighbors.
The one thing I will caution you on, is after staying here, other Airbnb’s won’t be as appealing. Travis really did set the bar incredibly high and I miss the fun times our family had while staying here."

Stayed a few nights","Travis communicated quickly and was so thoughtful. He left the porch light on for me when I told him I would arrive after dark. This place is appropriately named. It is cozy, comfortable and very clean. It was decorated for Easter, which was so sweet. There was candy, cokes, popcorn and water and tons of extras like condiments and spices. The bed was as or more comfortable than my own. I slept deep and woke refreshed. I originally inquired about one that was bigger hosted by a lady named April, but when I asked her if it was in a safe neighborhood, it must have made her mad because she said she wanted to wait for someone staying longer than 5 nights. Im glad she did cause I got the best deal and much cuter home. Travis is a great host and this cottage is close to everything. If I have to come back for business, I hope to stay again in this cozy cottage."

We originally planned to stay at his place on our way out to the east coast from Colorado. However, Travis told us the day before that the previous tenant had tested positive for COVID-19. My husband and I were driving cross country to see my (elder, cancer surviving) parents, and the honesty was invaluable. I know some people will value, well, location and beauty over honesty, so I put that first! But his honesty and integrity is what puts Travis over the top! Thank you Travis! Due to this reason, we opted to stay with Travis as we drove back from PA to CO."

Stayed a few nights","We are residents of Terre Haute and wanted to offer visiting family more than our spare room. My niece and her husband were visiting with their poodle. This home was the perfect fit for them! This place packs a punch for being well equipped and anticipating a travelers' needs. My family was so happy in this space, so I wanted to share my niece's personal words for this review:
""The Cozy Little Cottage is an AirBnB gem! The host(s) have truly thought of every little detail to make your stay a truly comfortable and memorable one. Between the super thoughtful and generous amenities (and generous is almost an understatement) to the cozy and inviting decor and cottage set-up, this place is a fantastic little getaway. It’s quaint but roomy, tucked away in a quiet little neighborhood area, and everything you need (and we mean everything- the host was even generous enough to have cold drinks and condiments in the fridge!) is within reach. Every space in the cottage is well thought out, efficient and very clean! We felt like we were staying in the very welcoming, very comfortable home of a good friend or family member. Wish every place was as lovely as this one! The guest book is a testament to the amazing job the host(s) have done and continue to do! If there were more stars, we’d happily give more than 5!"""

My son was graduating from ISU so I brought my family and in-laws in we slept there, and there was plenty of room, we had 6, great kitchen and gathering space as we able to some of my sons friends over for lunch over the weekend. it was very nice to. E able to gather there
A lot of thought went into the place with the design and finishing touches , well done like a and spacious loft area was really cute. Many design and finishing touches to make you feel at home.
Upon arrival, it looked like there was had some things was out of place. I reached to Medina immediately within 20 minutes she had her service there to put things back in place and to insure that our stay was “best in class “
Im in construction management and have build many boutique hotels in Chicago. Her product and service toward her guests was excellent and would be fitting to be associated
I’d highly recommend staying there if you’re in the area, good price, great place, caring owner."

Stayed one night","We had a one night stay with a late night arrival to Melina’s place. She was able to take us same-day on a long road trip, and this home was the perfect oasis for our exhausting day of driving. Melina sent a check-in code right away but be sure to click on the link to the lock system, because it took us a little extra time to figure it out when we arrived. (I’d never used this particular brand before - it’s great, but user-error is real lol!) The floor plan is very open on the first floor and was a perfect little suite set up for my mom. I took the upstairs suite (it’s the whole second half-floor) and heads up (pun fully intended here!) that the bathroom was perfectly-sized for a shorter-statured human like myself - would not recommend for anyone over 5’6” given the way the walls are angled there. Everything is beautifully appointed, cleverly designed, and thoughtfully arranged. Melina is very communicative and kind, and we are looking forward to staying again next time we pop through!"

The upstairs is beautiful, but not functional as it was difficult to use the bathroom and walk around for those of us over 6 feet. There are low ceilings on either side of the peak of house so we hit our head quite a few times.
I would still stay there again, just would not use the upstairs.

The beds were comfortable, great appliances, and we appreciated all the special touches around the house. Melina was very accommodating, responded quickly, and flexible with our checkout time when our travel schedule changed. We would highly recommend and would stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","The location is on a corner in a quiet area of Terre Haute. The location is very quiet during the day and night. Parking was easily accessible. Checking in/access was easy, as well. Terre Haute isn't large, so the location is easily accessible to any portion of town, but is fairly close to the local regional airport. A good place for smaller parties; be sure to pay attention to the face that there's no washer and dryer. We ended up not needing one, but I missed that during booking. Otherwise, we would gladly stay here again."

Stayed with kids","This place was great. We had five people but it never felt crowded. At night 3 more family members would come over to visit and there was plenty of room. I loved that there was a crock pot. I cooked chili for 8 one night. I appreciated the small details. Lots of hangers in the closets, luggage racks, make up wipes, cleansing pads, Q tips and cotton balls. The decor is pleasant and soothing colors. Fold out queen bed in living room is good quality and comfortable. Easy check out. Some places require so many things done I wonder why the cleaning fee is high. Not here. We will stay here next time we come to town. The host is very responsive."

Stayed a few nights","Cheyenne's place was a perfect home-base for our visit to Terre Haute. Clean, cozy, and well-appointed, it is a remarkably good deal. One thing I'll mention that may not be evident from the description is that it was a great space for my 92-year-old mother who has limited mobility. There are three steps (with a railing) to enter, but all the rooms are on the first floor, there are no funky stumble spots between rooms, and there is a grab bar in the shower. We loved the home and would definitely book here again."

The house itself is just like the pictures show.
We stayed there in August of 2023 and liked it enough to book it when we travel back again for Christmas this year. The host Cheyenne was very accommodating and fast to respond to any questions we had. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a quiet, cute and safe place to stay while in the Terre Haute area."

Well stocked for cooking and very comfortable for a quiet night in. It was close to the major shopping areas and food. It was also close to the Moonlite Drive Inn.
Cheyenne and Raj were always quick to respond including adding an extra day so I could stay longer.
I appreciate it. Next time we are in Terre Haute we will check to see if the home is available.
Thanks again!!
Lucy and Lucia"
