Stayed a few nights","Gary was amazing. We made our reservation day of and Gary immediately offered us an early check in. The house is a lovely little place. It is perfect for a cozy weekend getaway. The lofting is a fun addition. Everything you could want is within walking distance and Gary was more than helpful in picking the best places to go. The area felt residential and safe with the beach, fun breweries and coffee shops within walking distance. 100% would visit again, a must book in traverse city."

Stayed a few nights",Gary is a fabulous host. He greeted me and did a walk through of his airbnb. The location is what drew me to this Airbnb. Walking a few blocks and you’re in downtown TC. Quaint and beautiful neighborhood. Pay attention to the loft and ladder set up. I wasn’t comfortable with it. I was very careful going up and coming down. It was a warm first evening and Gary walked me through cooling the loft down via the window unit air conditioning and ceiling fan. That helped! (The windows don’t even have an option to open!) Last but not least: I wish we had an extra refrigerator around here and the hosts def utilize the freezer in the unit. In my 100 plus stays that might have been a first.. like staying with family but paying for it :)

It's very close to the TART hike/bike trail, which we enjoyed. It was also very close, and easy to walk, into town where all the shops and restaurants are located. Gary and Lisa were so hospitable. They took the time to welcome us and give us some great recommendations on places to eat and visit. Without hesitation, we would stay there again when visiting Traverse City!"

Gary and Lisa were great hosts and seem like really lovely people. Their place tells a story and I enjoyed all the unique decor. It was a peaceful, clean, and comfortable studio that made us feel right at home. Gary was very informative and texted me photos and instructions. We met him upon arrival and he shared some tips on what to do nearby. They provided wine, beer, coffee, milk, and cereal for us. We absolutely loved The Little Fleet and lucked out being in the City in the midst of pride celebrations. We look forward to staying with them again as there's lots more I'd love to explore in town."

Everything was very cozy and I thought the various reading materials were a nice touch. There's plenty to do with shops and eateries on the garden level, but visiting the downtown area is very worth it too. Highly recommended."

The bed was incredibly comfy, we fell asleep immediately. The location is fantastic too, there’s restaurants for both breakfast and dinner as well as other stores in the same building.

We enjoyed a fabulous dinner at Trattoria Stella before a concert at Interlochen, and had brunch downstairs in the morning. Joshua has photo books about the historic buildings and a folio of suggestions of things to do in the area. I love that the trees on the grounds are mapped out.

Condo was conveniently near to all downtown sites and areas, but still provided a quick 3 minute respite from all the bustle of a busy day.

Stayed with kids","This was our very first time ever trying an AirBnB, but we may just have become overnight converts! This condo was amazing! The price was very reasonable (especially considering what local hotels are charging). As rookie AirBnB'ers, Joshua's instructions were super clear. Driving instructions directed to the parking and front door of this large estate. My kids loved entering the secret code for elevator service as well as sleeping on a (very comfortable) Murphy Bed for the first time. Because of dietary needs, it was great having a full kitchen! The complex is absolutely gorgeous. The building has such rich history and we found it fun to learn all about it. The local boutique's and restaurants on the campus make this a special treasure as well. The location off the lake keeps you out of the heaviest traffic and lets you park for free which we thought was a great bonus. With a 30 minute drive you can go to other areas like Sleeping Bear Dunes, Empire, Glen Arbor, Sutton's Bay, & Leland."

2. Concerns -
a) the window shades are a see thru type that lets in a lot of light. We were there June 19-22, sun up 5:30 and down after 10pm. Very bright during these times.
b) we were contacted the first night regarding the people in the condo below ours that we were making excessive noise and jumping around? Nothing could be more false, unless the place is usually vacant and there are no sounds???

The Native shampoo, conditioner, and body wash was a treat. The hallways in the condo areas are so quite. Not a sound. The only take away. which has nothing to do with the condo, was the facilities staff of this building were out clearing snow on the sidewalks with their machine at 4:30 in the morning. Since there are stores in the same building one can understand why the early hours. One could easily fall back to sleep."

Location is close to lots of hiking trailheads and the Keystone Soccer Complex. also just a short distance from downtown without having to deal with all the traffic of coming from East Bay.
The condo was very clean and well stocked. Both the bed and Murphy bed were quite comfortable. Communication with host was excellent. Would definitely stay again! Highly recommend!!"

Within the Commons, Red Spire is excellent for breakfast/brunch - highly recommend it. We had dinner at Stella one evening…thought it was average, but is a unique setting.

Stayed a few nights",Fantastic spot! Such an easy walk to downtown. The only reason I put 4 and not 5 stars is the parking. The only overnight parking is a block away and is $20 a night. If you stay more than a a night or two the cost really adds up.

If you arrive at night the hallway will be dark but lights come on immediately via sensor. We wanted to rate 4.5 stars: the bedroom is not for light sleepers; the AC unit outside the window is loud. Parking situation is not ideal (but manageable) and the wifi was not working during our stay. It is a very lovely apartment for a couple to stay.

Many special touches to make you feel valued and at home: Q-tips in the bathroom, air freshener, toothbrush holder, fuzzy throws for snuggling in the evening. Carrie communicated very well and timely with respect to check-in / out instructions, location, and parking. We had no trouble using the adjacent parking lot or the Harding structure for overnight. Highly recommend this space and would stay again."

Stayed a few nights","This was our first time visiting Traverse City. We didn't know the area, so based on maps, we chose Carrie's Modern Condo. It was exactly as pictured in the review. It did require being able to climb two flights of steps (FYI), which wasn't a problem. There was paid parking behind the building. The condo was super clean and had a full kitchen and one bedroom. We liked the big windows which allowed us to see the weather and some of the action outside. There was a huge TV inside and a smaller one in the bedroom. Washer and dryer with laundry soap in hall closet. We liked how walkable the location was. We were literally a block away from the main strip. There is a walking/bike path not far from the condo. We also found various places to kayak. We hope to stay in this awesome condo again. Thank you Carrie!"

The only downside was paying extra to park in the parking garage (super close!) which was 20 bucks a night, as the lot right behind the condo does not allow parking overnight. If you can overlook this, this condo is perfect for a TC stay. Walking distance to literally everything including the beautiful bay. The host was also super communicative and quick with responses! Will stay again for sure. 10/10!"

Self check-in was a breeze, just note that there is a code to get into the building and then another code to get into the room. The condo was spotless and I loved the modern furnishings. I slept on the pull-out sofa bed and it was very comfy!
You do have to pay for parking so factor that into your costs (I think we paid $26 to park from 7pm to 11am the next day at the Hardy parking garage).
Given the location and how nice and comfy the condo was, I would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","This stay was very nice in terms of convenience, location, and cleanliness.
The host is professional and responsive, even late at night.
However, be sure to consider the strong lingering odor from years of smoking in this older building if you are sensitive to this type of smell. We had to leave the window open in order to neutralize this smell and tolerate being in the room.
The room itself is quite small as well as the bathroom. This is important to note if you have a lot of luggage/toiletry storage, it is suitable for up to 2 people. It is about half the size of typical hotel rooms.
As many have stated. The walls are very thin, but as long as guests in other rooms are aware and respectful of this, it should be manageable. We were fortunate to not have anyone loud and rowdy staying during the time we were."

What truly set this AirBnB apart, though, was the genuine warmth and hospitality of the hosts. From the moment, we booked, they were incredibly responsive, offering valuable suggestions and ensuring that every aspect of our stay was well taken care of. They went above and beyond to make us feel welcome, providing us with a warm greeting upon arrival and taking the time to show us around the property.

The apartment was so cute and clean and perfectly decorated I told my husband we were moving in! She had great recommendations for local spots which was perfect for our first time in Traverse City. The location was ideal as we were close to downtown and the Vasa Trail (we brought our mountain bikes) but was tucked away in a safe and quiet neighborhood. I would say she far exceeded our expectations and we would absolutely recommend her for your stay! Would give 10 stars if possible :)

Stayed a few nights","The Condo is situated in Downtown Traverse City, almost new, Fantastically Designed and Appointed. Very Clean. You could not ask for more. It had everything. Very clean with a bottle of Sparkling Wine waiting for us.
From enjoying the restraurants a few blocks away, to having a nitecap accross the street. Shopping for ourselves, and enjoying the offerings of the downtown area, while listening to the waters of the Boardmen River and the gathering of birds that enjoy the waters.
Traveling to the Pennisula and other areas was close at hand and always enjoyable, but the best part was coming back to the condo with a Kitchen to fix a few morsels that we picked up on the way back.
Dave and his Staff are fantastic, we did not have to reach out to him, as we had clear instructions and great ideas that were left for us to explore.
We will be back, maybe for a Fall Color trip!

Just across the river from the main part of downtown, but also with several bars and restaurants right by the condo. We walked everywhere and could be at the waterfront in less than 15 minutes. The inside of the condo was beautiful and they thought of everything- outlets everywhere, chargers, lots of dish ware and several small appliances (loved the hot water pot for tea!), fluffy towels and sheets, clean, beautiful bathroom, comfy beds, and even chairs and beach towels in the closet. We will definitely look to stay here again when we return to Traverse City!"

Stayed a few nights","First of all, we had a great experience. Dave was friendly and super responsive. The apartment was beautiful with a very comfortable layout and bed. It was convenient and clean.
There are a few things we wish we knew before going. This is on the top floor of an apartment (three flights up) with no elevator. If you're staying for a while and need to bring things up, it is hard to do that due to the narrow hallways and the annoyance of carrying heavy luggage. The parking situation was also frustrating. There are limited spots out back, so we were having to pay $20 a night to park in the garage next door.
Last, if you care about privacy this isn't the place for you. The big bay windows in the apartment all face each other so you look right into each other's places. We sat with the blinds closed most of the time.
I would highly recommend this place again- just a few things to consider depending on your trip. Dave was great- and the place was well maintained."

The condo had everything we needed and the bed was so comfortable that we actually slept well.
We parked in the parking structure next door and were able to take advantage of the free ChargePoint EV charging, which was a real perk.
The only thing we slightly regretted was having no elevator after hiking the sand dunes one day and our legs being so sore lol.
Check-in instructions were well detailed and we had no issues during our stay.

Parking can be tricky in the condos lot, but thankfully this one came with a parking pass for the garage next store which is only a few extra steps away.
Also The Benedict is a great spot for breakfast/brunch and a block away from the condo!
Highly recommend Dave’s condo for your stay in the TC area!"

A perfect location to walk to everything in downtown TC, plus parking (either in the lot or adjoining garage if the lot’s full.) The only slight downsides to be aware of are that it is a third-floor walk up with no elevator (not a problem for us but good to be aware of if it’s an issue), and that it’s a little tricky to get around downtown for the next few months with the Cass St and 8th St bridges are both shut down to car and pedestrian traffic. Other than those things, a perfect home base for your adventures!"

Love the parking pass in the parking garage right next door. I have an electric vehicle and with charger in the garage it provided an overnight charge each night.
I had a few questions for Dave and he literally answered within 2 min, got my answers and gave suggestions. Was great to work with."

Bathrooms and kitchen were spotless. Beds were very comfortable. The only thing that could have been cleaner was the patio. Lots of spider webs. We just used the furniture on the beach instead. But I do feel like that’s harder to keep up with and it wouldn’t keep me from staying again. We really enjoyed walking right out to beach. Overall, great stay!"

Group trip","Steps out the back door is a nice sandy beach and beautiful lake. Jet ski and boat rentals are next door and so are bike rentals (we did it all). The condo is very nice, clean and comfortable. The beds were comfy, the darkening shades were a bonus. Big bathrooms with plenty of plush towels. The open concept kitchen and living area are great for family time. The condo living was great for our family of 4, we felt very comfortable. The location to Downtown TC is a bit farther out then I was expecting (had hoped to bike and walk more into town, it’s way too far for a walk, the bike was a good 30+ min, be sure to use the awesome bike trail behind Einsteins bike rental, the kids and I enjoyed the 6+ mile bike ride there and back as long as you use the trail). The farm club was a new restaurant experience worth a visit, and the wineries on old mission are easy to access from the home so that’s a plus too. The jet skis were a big highlight. A+ rental. Katy is a great host very responsive."

There were plenty of towels, beach towels, pillow, throws, etc. Katy was a great host, incredibly responsive at all hours of the day & night.

We enjoyed the sunset and sunrise everyday and all of the amenities that were included. This Airbnb had everything you could think of in the home from the kitchen appliances to the plate ware and cookware! Not to mention the heated floors (which was a pleasantly unexpected amenity) Katy was the perfect host and was very responsive and super informative, which we appreciated! Only negative was that the deck was not assembled and beach chairs were not present as pictured when we stayed and blocked what would’ve been a full 360 view. I’m guessing it’s because we went while it was still relatively cold. (Beginning of April) Nonetheless we worked around it and had an amazing time! We will definitely be returning as soon as we can!"

Stayed with a pet","T.C. rooftop rentals was amazing during my stay here. While there was an issue with the AC unit, they were very quick to accommodate me. When I was set to check out, another unit was offered to me an additional night to offset the warm nights I had in the prior unit. I would definitely recommend this company, the communication and friendliness alone will bring me back. Additionally, the second unit they put me up in is 10/10. Beautiful, cool and very clean. Thank you!"

There is construction going on but we never heard a thing; it was very quiet and peaceful. We appreciated their wonderful suggestions for trails etc. and visited a few during our stay. It was very thoughtful for the owners to include essentials like spices, aluminum foil and body wash for us to use during our stay. If you are looking for a place that puts you close to everything in TC, this is the place you will want to rent."

The pictures posted on the app are exactly what the place looks like. I highly recommend taking a 30-minute drive to hike Pyramid Point it’s an unbelievable scenery that doesn’t feel like it should be in Michigan! Also, don’t miss soaking in the hot tubs on the rooftop."

Stayed with a pet","One of the best nights of sleep I’ve ever had! …and I know it must’ve been the bed since I had my fur baby with me. With that said, for a pet friendly spot that’s closer to some busy streets (one was noticeably busier because of construction), the unit was so quiet. I love the overall design of the place and all the interiors were well thought out. For a business trip, this was such a great find. Loved the rooftop hot tubs and the space was perfect for WFH. The hosts also put a lot of effort into sharing local
Gems (the welcome guide inside the apartment was a charming touch). I’d agree that the restaurants and coffee shops they recommend are fabulous and it was nice being a very short drive from some of the best! For those traveling with family (kids), it’s worth noting that the location doesn’t have park or water access. It is close, however, but there is a precarious intersection to cross to get to the bay and local parks. Regardless, I would stay again!"

We loved how close it was to everything, and despite construction still going on, it was very quiet. The bed was so comfortable we are going to buy the same one for our home!
The hot tubs were a fun addition, and the bathtub in the bathroom was lovely. I bought some bath salts in town and used them in the tub for a relaxing night!
The owners provided clear and easy directions, and made sure we knew they were available if we needed anything. We were greeted in the condo with a book of their local favorite places to eat and things to do.
We will definitely be back and tell all our friends and family!"
