Stayed with kids",Everything was very nice. The home is clean and the beds we’re comfortable. The host reached out prior to our arrival and wanted to ensure that we would have adequate parking for our truck and trailer. We will definitely recommend this home to others and be back if we are in need of a place to stay while playing at the Beaver Dunes!

Stayed with a pet","Despite having to come to town for a funeral, the house/stay was great! The co-host was great at communicating, and checked in to ensure everything was as it should be. The place looks exactly like the pictures. It was very inviting, and felt like home! This was definitely a great find in such a small town! Will definitely stay here again when back visiting family!"

Stayed a few nights","My family of 4 stayed at Drew's place for my father's funeral. The house was simply adorable. The beds were so comfy, and there was more space than we expected. The entire house was very clean, and they had everything we needed. The host was very friendly and showed real concern when I was unable to get into my Airbnb account to respond to his messages. My father had been missing for some time, so the town was aware of his passing. The host was so kind and thoughtful to leave a single rose on the kitchen counter in my father's memory. I will definitely stay at Drew's place again when we return to Beaver to visit in the future. Thank you for everything."

Drew was welcoming with our same day booking, very responsive to communications, offered local tips, and friendly. The decor in this place was well thought out and made the place cozy - it’s obvious they take care of the property and are thoughtful. Beds were super comfortable and the grill was a fantastic surprise. Would definitely stay again if we come back through the area. Thanks so much - it was the holiday we needed!!!"

Parking was a little tight for bigger pickup. Overall nice place to stay. Only negative was I felt the final price was a little overpriced for the location in such a small town once the fees and taxes were added. Would recommend as a good clean place to stay though."

This is a traditional B&B that offers a home-cooked breakfast in the morning. We had a comfortable room furnished with antiques and artwork with a roomy en suite two-part bathroom with double his/hers sinks. I was able to use the sinks counter quite well as a computer desk and catch up on some work. The two of us plus quite a bit of luggage plus two large dogs fit comfortably.

We had never been to a bed and breakfast before and right away we loved it. The place itself and the room were spotless, and the bed was very comfortable. We slept so well and then enjoyed an incredible breakfast with great company. We only wished we could stay longer but we loved our time there!"

They even let me keep my bicycle in the foyer to be extra safe! Met me at the door, personal sign as I walked in welcoming me, showed me my room and the beverage nook (free soda, water, coffee, hot chocolate) and even helped me find a restaurant for a to-go order!
Room was spacious and beautiful, with separate vanity room and bathroom... Almost more like a suite than just a room. Bed was comfy and since I had to leave so early, they were kind enough to make me a Grab & Go breakfast! I'll definitely be staying here again!
Only suggestions I have:
- A sign with B&B visible from the road
- The directions link within your listing doesn't work on Google Maps."

From the moment I stepped through the door, I was swept away by the charm, comfort, and attention to detail that made this Airbnb experience truly exceptional.First and foremost, the communication with the host was outstanding. They were prompt, friendly, and went above and beyond to ensure a seamless check-in process. The warm welcome continued as I entered the space, finding it meticulously clean and beautifully decorated. The photos online don't do justice to the cozy ambiance and tasteful design that permeates every corner of this home.The attention to detail is what sets this Airbnb apart from the rest. From the well-curated selection of snacks and thoughtful decor to the fully equipped kitchen stocked with essentials, every element is carefully chosen to enhance the guest experience. It's clear that the host has put a lot of thought into creating a space that feels like a home away from home. Highly recommended!"

The beds were comfy only complaints i have is the water pressure was not the best and there isnt a skillet in the house big enough to cook in other than that ill definitely be booking again ill just bring my own pans

Mignon takes great care of this place, is very easy to work with, and has an affordable price point.

Stayed with kids","It was nice to find a place near our friends to stay. It was spacious and unique so the kids loved the house. The kitchen was well stocked with nice pans and utensils to make our own meals. I hope you use my old school potato masher when there ❤️ because it got left behind by mistake. The abundance of two plate sets allowed us to not have to wash between meals too, so we spent more time visiting. The outside patio table allowed us to enjoy the weather and make a fall wreath. The bathrooms were stocked with clean linen and finding hairspray available in the bathroom saved the day. The large friendly cats were funny. The farm was a favorite of the kids and my daughter loved the calf but I strongly recommend children not be allowed to roam with a bbgun while the property is occupied. By the grace of God our stay ended well."

The inside of the house was clean and nicely decorated and new. It was better than the pictures I thought. It was cool inside when we arrived on a sunny afternoon because the window unit works well and the temperatures dropped 50 degrees overnight so we got to test the heater too! The bed was firm but comfortable and we slept well. The TV worked great and was easy to find something to watch.
It was just what we needed and if I’m ever in Guymon again I would stay there."

Stayed with a pet","Location was private and close to the highway, so perfect for an overnight stop on a long road trip. It was as described and pictured. We arrived later in the evening on an especially hot day and the place was unbearably hot. Even with the air on all night on high, it was still so hot we had to put the kids in diapers to sleep instead of pajamas and our bulldog was nonstop panting. The filter needed replaced in the window unit too so that could also have been the issue. It was not especially clean either. There was hair on the sheets (so we washed them before sleeping on them) and in the bathroom. There was also half eaten takeout and leftover random food in and on the fridge. It doesn’t appear to have been cleaned, or at least not well, between guests so that was disappointing."

Stayed with kids","The house is in Elkhart Kansas, not a place people would go to find vacation type activities, but in a nice quiet little town. We were there for a family reunion and it was just what we needed. We didn't do any cooking or use the kitchen much but it was awesome if we'd have needed it. Elkhart had been getting a lot of rain and had some large storms so we were having trouble opening the door. I reached out to our contact and got help immediately. It was unlocking, just took some muscle to push it open and we weren't trying hard enough at first. We thought the lock wasn't working and didn't want to break anything. I would definitely stay again anytime I need to bring my family to Elkhart."

Stayed one night","No hot water, no internet, no TV. The place was not very clean although not exactly dirty either. The cement floor needs paint so it looked dirty. The windows were filthy, hadn't been cleaned in a very long time. The host left a note demanding that we take the garbage out and wash the dishes or we'd be charged extra. Seems like that would be included in the cleaning fee. That was not a big thing, but I resented the threat, especially since we did not get all we paid for - hot water and internet. What is going on here is that if we don't do his job (clean the place) then we are charged extra, but if he doesn't do his (provide hot water) we have no recourse. That is a bad way to do business."

Stayed with kids","I was pretty disappointed upon arriving . I usually can over look most things. But before arrival we were charged per person a hefty cleaning fee. And the day of arrival we were informed that a man would be staying in a camper on property. He was literally off the front porch and made us feel uncomfortable , especially since there weren’t any window coverings in common areas . There are several cameras inside the house that made you feel like your being watched. The house was dirty, dead bugs everywhere and piles of them on floors and dishes in cabinets were dirty. His place has potential, but needs some TLC to make you feel welcome. We were very considerate of his property, but a few days later he said we ruined a TV remote. We never even turned on a TV. I should have taken the time to read all the reviews before booking. Several people have had the same complaints. I needed a large place in that area to stop and rest on our way to Colorado and there aren’t many in the area. This place has the potential be a wonderful AirB&B so hopefully they will take the criticism to help improve it for others."

I unplugged the cameras on the inside, there are cameras outside. Be careful using the recliner it is not stable. Don't be surprised when the door handle for the bathroom fall off.
Shower stalls are small and the water pressure in one is low and the other will drowned you."

Stayed one night","The house was ok. It is a large house with a game room and it was clean. The bed my wife and I slept on was comfortable. There is no master suite so the bathroom is down the hall. We had two issues during our one night stay. The first issue for us were the cameras inside the house. There were cameras in the kitchen, living room and game room. Not sure if there were more. This was disturbing for us; it didn't feel private and felt like we were being watched/monitored during our stay. The host told us to turn the cameras around if we want but, in my opinion, there should not be active cameras inside an Airbnb residence. The second issue was the front storm door. We received direction to make sure we closed the storm door all the way. We followed the hosts directions and didn't have any issues with the door during our stay. After we left, we were contacted by Chad that the door had been damaged. They requested that we pay $750 for new hinges. Airbnb settled the dispute in our favor but renters be aware."

The wood was too big and no axe there to cut wood to burn in the inside stove. The showers have low pressure and the first shower is hard to set to the right temperature. I followed close out instructions but had issues with the host. I would not stay here again since they have too many instructions and cameras inside the house. They advertise 125 a night, however, that's for one person only. After you select the stay you'll be charged an addition 30 dollars per person. The kitchen was dirty and disorganize and we left out cleaner than I found it."

There’s also this musky mold smell in the kitchen and the living room. I tried to open the windows to freshen the area but the owner has put screws on them so you’re unable to open. But the worse part of it all is that there was about 5 security cameras inside throughout the house, I don’t even know how this is allowed through Airbnb, I understand some for outside but inside is invading of privacy. The house is surrounded by cameras on the outside as well, it’s a fortress. So the area has potential if all the diys were completed and the place was really cleaned up."

Stayed one night","I pray no one has the experience I did. After driving 8 hours all I wanted to do was take a shower. Unfortunately the second I opened the shower curtain I realized that unfortunately the shower had not been cleaned at all probably in multiple visits. There was spit and hair on the walls, dust built up in the shelves, and worst of all there was mouse crap all over the floor of the shower stall. I then got told I was full of crap (with different language) by the absolute “Chad” that’s owns this house. Even though I had pictures of the spit the hair and the mouse poop was still on the sponge I used to do their job. He has been too lazy to take out all the old tiles, concrete chunks, and old rotting pallets. This should have led me to realize that he would’ve been to lazy to make sure the house is clean. Horrible experience someone would have to pay me 3x the booking price to have to deal with this joke again."

My only complaint would be the cleanliness of the house. We found 4-5 spiders in the bathroom and more in the living spaces. It didn’t bother me but someone with a fear of bugs, especially spiders, would find being there quite difficult. Still, it’s a big, quiet space that for the right person will prove a perfect space, especially if you have kids."

Stayed one night","Very clean and cozy home. Barely any stairs so very accessible to those who don’t like stairs, the whole home is one level. Very spacious and definitely a place to call home temporarily in small town elkhart. My boyfriend and I only stayed the night along our route to the West Coast and although we have never been to Kansas, we felt very at home at this airbnb. For our visit, the no cleaning fee was VERY useful, as sometimes booking airbnb’s for 1 night and paying an $100 cleaning fee when we barely rustled the blankets is a bit frustrating. It was nice to be able to just clean up after ourselves from the short time we had stayed and not have to overpay. If you were to stay a full week and cook meals in the home, the cleaning fee may be more worth it than scrubbing the place clean but in our case, it was nice! The backyard was spacious for the dogs and the security cameras/system outside was comforting considering were new to the area. Also, the floors being majority concrete made it very pet friendly. If we were ever in Elkhart again, we would definitely return!"

Everything closes by 10:00pm around town so get all snacks, drinks and toiletries before you arrive. Any questions asked had a 1 hour delay for a reply. Other than that, it was a good stay. Make sure you visit WILDCAT CAFE for breakfast. Great and prompt service with friendly staff!"

Spent a lot of time in the game room. HUGE kitchen with everything you need! This was one of the main reasons we choose this place.
Big back patio with plenty of seating and a fire pit. There is more than enough to do to keep you entertained during your entire stay.
They even have nice high-end appliances to use. Excellent communication and very friendly!"

Stayed a few nights","We are 5 star Airbnb frequent users. We generally don’t write negative reviews and were going to let this one go but have reason to believe the host wrote a false and defamatory review of us.
We stayed here for 3 days as a result of a car accident that stranded us in Elkhart, KS - far off the beaten path. The host tried to collect $455 in additional cleaning fees as a result of our dogs - the place purported to be pet friendly.
Here’s the truth: This property has a “pool” of standing, rancid, brackish water in the backyard. The yard is also full of dead animals and old dog poop. Like most dogs would ours apparently foraged in this grossness. As a result one dog had an accident on an inexpensive, small rug. We cleaned up as best we could. The place has cement floors so it’s not really possible for dogs to do any real damage.
The host was aggressive and called us a series of names when we refused the baseless cleaning up charge. Among them: that we were not adults, not responsible dog owners, liars etc. Read our other reviews and you can determine for yourself whether what the impolite host here said is true.
Also: When we checked in the place looked like it hadn’t been cleaned at all let alone Covid cleaned. Dirty dishes in the dishwasher and old coffee and filter in the coffee pot.
Again, since we were essentially stuck here with nowhere else to go, we weren’t going to complain. But when the host makes up a story, calls you names, and trys to take advantage, we are not going to be silent.
Everyone else we met in Elkhart, KS was a pleasure. The host here was not."

The house is located right inside town so finding a grocery store and gas was very convenient! We did visit the point of rocks about a 30-40 minute drive from the house and it was pretty worth it considering the location of Elkhart! Overall a great experience for our last minute trip.

Stayed with kids","What a beautiful home. We went for a Christmas COVID get away, and couldn't have chosen better! We checked in and didn't even leave for 2 days. When we ventured out on the 3rd day, we found the town offered some dining options and a really nice home town Grocery store.
We chose the location because we wanted to get away and rural is a nice choice during this period of the pandemic. It was about 20 degrees warmer than our home town and very flat and open, everything we were looking for. We traveled with 2 dogs and they loved the yard, it is fenced, but there is an opening near the front gate that our adventure dog found, we were able to block it with available plywood for the rest of the stay. It was a bit difficult to find in the dark as it is well hidden and private, but it is through a large metal gate. The home had everything we needed and more. We cooked a lot for ourselves and there wasn't anything missing in the kitchen.
Beautiful home, lovely stay, nice communication. We look forward to visiting again!"

It needed polishing but had the essentials. Very close to road so if you cant sleep with trucks passing its not your place. The heat is concentrated in the master bedroom. I did not feel comfortable letting my infant crawl around. Over all it was a okay place to rest our heads in our travels.

Stayed a few nights","After checking in we realized the sheets on the king sized bed were still wet they smelled good you could tell they were freshly washed someone had just rushed them out of the dryer. Luckily we found this early we stripped the bed and put the sheets in the dryer and we notified the host. We then left to have dinner with family and when we returned Trey and Jena had brought over a new set of bedding ,remade the bed, and left a note. Trey and Jena were very responsive and super friendly! They answered every question promptly! It is clear that the hosts are working on making it more comfortable and up dating it. Literally my only complaint would be the front steps/porch could use immediate attention as my boyfriend is an amputee and uses crutches to get around. The steps leading into the house are in pretty bad shape and the floor of the porch isn't a flat surface and could easily be a trip hazzard other than that I would rent this place again. It was a comfortable stay with great hosts"

Stayed with kids","I wish that I had known that we were booking a mobile home. The description never mentions that you are staying in a trailer park. There were storms the first night we were there and I was nervous we had nowhere safe to go.
Inside the actual home, we were provided with what basic needs- beds, a place to eat, and bathrooms. However, the state of the place was not welcoming. The floor was dirty and the surfaces of the kitchen were not clean. I spent some time sweeping and wiping everything down when we arrived.
There are quite a few updates that need to happen to make this place a little more comfortable/ presentable. Simply having a towel bar available in the bathroom can make a difference. The outlet in one of the bathrooms does not work. Curtains over the windows in the living room and kitchen can help guests feel like it's a more private space. This is a home more suitable for college kids wanting to party who may not care about cleanliness."

Stayed with kids","This was a great Airbnb and host. Jana was very communicative and proactive from start to finish. She offered extra amenities and advice that were relevant to our stay. We felt like we were in good hands and that any of our needs would be met. Regarding the location itself - there are not many places to stay in this small town to begin with - however this exceeded our expectations and was nicer than most of the big hotel chains. Very homey, lots of amenities. The room was very large with plenty of space/furniture to be comfortable. The community fridge is full size (unlike the mini-fridge you get at most hotels) and was a very nice feature that we utilized for all our drinks and food during the stay. The kitchen area was fully stocked with a number plates, utensils, napkins, etc. The commons area was a nice place to hangout at the end of each day. Highly recommend!"
