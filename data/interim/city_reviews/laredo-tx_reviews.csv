Stayed with kids",Michelle was very responsive and helpful. Booking her house made more sense than booking 2 hotel rooms for our stay and the photos were exactly what we found when we opened the front door. Check in and out was very easy and the house was an easy distance to everywhere we needed to go (which was all around Laredo for a baseball tournament). I would definately book again if we ever came back to Laredo.

Stayed a few nights","The house is very clean and nicely decorated. The house has many wallflower plug-ins. So, while the smell is nice, it is also overwhelming. The neighborhood is quiet during the day. but quite noisy at night and in the early morning. A lot of neighbors, who seem to have lost their mufflers, enjoyed revving their engines during these hours. There is also a nearby train, but we only heard it few times. Not a complaint, but just informational, all bedrooms are upstairs. Overall, the place is really good and the host was great - I would stay again, but will bring earplugs."

The location was fantastic, allowing us to easily explore the area while still providing a peaceful retreat at the end of the day. Without a doubt, we had a fantastic experience and would highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a memorable and comfortable stay."

Stayed a few nights","What a beautiful monochromatic and modern restful space. The bathrooms were so high-end looking and the shower revitalized me. A true townhouse that creates a private world in the middle of town. Big city tastes throughout. Thank you for using your talents to create this beautiful space and making it available to all of us. I thought the bed was so comfy I gleefully overslept. We opted to bring back takeout meals just to be able to spend more time in this home. About 15 mins away from Quinto Sol, an excellent vegan/vegetarian restaurant."

Stayed a few nights","We found Michelle's condo to be a wonderful fit. The location is great. It's close to Target, HEB, etc, but was still quiet and tucked away. Parking is easy. Instructions to get inside were clear. The home is extremely well decorated with contemporary designs. The A/C worked like a charm. The water temperature and pressure were perfect. I loved the outdoor space with twinkle lights. I work remotely so I took advantage of a desk that was set up in one of the bedrooms. The wifi was excellent. We hope to be back."

We were able to cook on the last night there, but I wished I had packed some ziplock bags to take my leftovers; the salsa I made was delicious.
Thank you, Maria! We shall return, possibly in June!"

The private entrance is a lot of privacy, all clean and tidy. Maria was always on top of our needs and supporting us with recommendations of places to go, she was very flexible with schedules and accommodation.

The entry way was a bit narrow so if you have a wide frame or bags that could pose a challenge but honestly there is nothing she can really do to adress that. 10/10 would recommend and come back."

Upon arrival, the property was exactly as described in the photos and by the hosts. The AC worked perfectly well, the restrooms were clean and functional. The internet/wifi was excellent. The TVs in the living room and Master bedroom are large (65""). The kitchen was stocked with the basic necessities to prepare a simple meal. HEB is just across the street. Several restaurants are very close. The accents and furniture are tasteful. Very cozy by our standards.
We were able to rest and relax. It was literally a PERFECT stay. Thank you Amalia and Jorge for being perfect hosts."

Stayed with kids","Amalia’s place is absolutely amazing! We drove in tired and late not expecting much but once inside, we found the place clean and beautifully decorated with everything we needed to feel right at home. The owner didn’t skimp on providing good organic keurig coffee, bottled water, and high quality soaps and toiletries. The place has huge tv’s, super comfortable beds, extra blankets and plenty of fluffy cotton towels. She also provided soaps for the laundry and dishwasher but we didn’t use those appliances as it was a short stay. The location is in front of a highly trafficked street so some noice will be heard but nothing intolerable. The bathrooms have good water pressure and plenty of natural light throughout. One thing worth mentioning is that it’s on the second floor and the condo is two stories so there’s plenty of stairs to climb. Overall, we were very impressed and delighted with our stay and highly recommend Amalias place. Special thanks to Jorge for all his help and attention."

Stayed one night","So, to be fair the place itself was very neat. The beds were comfy, and the host was very helpful and communicative. I wrestled between giving this place 4 stars but ultimately settled on 3 for the following reasons:
1) I reserved what was marketed on the app as an “entire place”. Now, I’m sure technically it might count but in truth, it was a garage that had been remodeled into an apartment space. While it did have a little kitchenette, and a restroom of its own (aka I didn’t share a space with the family of the attached house) it did have a wall that connected with the home. So it felt more like a private room than an entire place to myself. It was a bit odd to pull up to a home with cars in the driveway and realize that this was basically a detached area semi connected to the house. So I’m not sure if that’s something I missed on my end or not, but definitely wouldn’t recommend if you’re looking for an entire place to yourself.
2) The heater didn’t work and it dipped into the 40s at night.
3) There are a lot of dogs in the neighborhood and anytime someone was outside they would go crazy barking. Woke me up a few times throughout the night.
Again, to be fair the host was awesome and the space was nice. Just not what I thought it was."

The kitchen had all the spices we needed to cook. I highly recommend Sylvia's place and would love to book it again in the future. Sylvia was a great host, too. She also gave us supplies (crayons, papers, and erasures) so my daughter can have some fun drawing and coloring. It was a great experience having her as a host."

Just a head’s up to my fellow hot sleepers: the mattresses are wrapped in plastic for protection, but I woke up sweating my tail off both nights as a result - even with the a/c cranked low! Overall though, we plan to stay there again. It’s a super nice spot! Best part was the fact that it’s fenced in. A toddler parent dream come true!"

And, if arriving at night, the street is very dark, don’t pull directly into the complex, the unit is the very first one on the street. We drove around for a bit in the complex. Maybe that was our own oversight and being tired, but there’s the note if it helps anyone unsure of where the unit is located.
The host was responsive."

Stayed one night",I am a repeat customer and always feel peaceful when we stay here. They added lighting to the patio right outside the walkway and door area which was awesome for our check-in. I happen to come in late in the evening but this made everything so smooth for me. Great place!

This is definitely a gem, if I were to visit Laredo again this will be my forever go to place.
Lovey touches to the studio, you feel right at home, just such a lovely stay. AND traveling with an infant can be tricky but this home provided me everything I needed for the stay to be successful. Thank you Maria!"

The restroom is a tad tight/small, but it’s not a dealbreaker for us. We will stay there again on future trips to Laredo!"

A few things that could be improved to receive a 5 star review would be the following: more linens & blankets. Stain-free comforters & furniture. En suite bathroom needs a mirror that’s mounted to be able to see your head for makeup/hair. It was not usable. Some lamps didn’t work. Also tv’s in the bedrooms would’ve been a nice touch. Other than that, our stay was great. It served our needs."

Everyone had their own bedroom and bathroom, and the kitchen/dinning area was large enough to accommodate all of us. We spent the majority of our time around the pool and hanging out in the gazebo. Restaurants and shopping are very close by. A very large storm came through the night before we got there, and did some major damage in the neighborhood. Annibal got in contact with us right away and went above and beyond to get the storm debris cleaned up and the pool ready for us. He was very quick to respond to any questions we had. We would definitely stay with him again!!!"

I wish the pool would have been cleaned. Although we were told it was cleaned that morning and it was due to the rain making it cloudy. The kids still got in but it was a little too murky for me I like to see the bottom and to be able to tell what's in a pool. The furniture was outdated and felt completely uncomfortable to sit on and we had a few issues with the log in for a couple of the bedrooms were we had to use our own Netflix log in because we kept getting an error message stating the account was not authorized on that particular tv even though it was on the same wifi in the house. The bathrooms and floor could have been cleaned a little better. We had to keep shoes on the children and throw away nasty socks. However, we did have plenty of linens so that helped."

Group trip","We were a group of clinicians that flew in to train with local providers. This place was perfect for a professional crew. It also had large spaces perfect to have my mom’s family come for a nice dinner. The ensuites were unbelievably perfect for 6 women.
It was particularly nice that the host knew my family both in Laredo and Rio Grande City.
We look forward to renting there when we do the next training.
Thank you!"

Very helpful and very wonderful throughout our stay. He was quick on responding any questions/concerns prior and during our stay.

Group trip","My team and I traveled for a work project the week of November 7th. We had previously rented some smaller home as I had sent a three or four member team. I had thought we were going to have to rent two homes, but found this place with just enough space so team members could enjoy their own room. According to the team members that had traveled previously, this was the most comfortable. We enjoyed the spacious home with enough bedrooms and restrooms for my team. We booked it for the week of the 14th as well. Although we did not get to enjoy the backyard as much as what we would have liked, I noticed there where both gas, charcoal and wood burning grills available. Annibal communicated well prior to the stays and during the stays to make sure everything was ok. He even offered a late check out if needed which for the first week was well welcomed since we had to work half a day. This gave us time to come back to shower and pack before our 6.5 hour drive back to Dallas/Fort Worth."

Group trip",This house is amazing. Every room has its own restroom which made every one of our family feel comfortable. The hospitality we received was great. Definitely one of the best place we have ever stayed at. Rooms are a decent size with great closet space. Definitely recommend this house for family bonding vacation.

Stayed with kids","This is the second time my family and I have been to Annibal’s house. Every time that we have been there everything is extremely clean and he is quick to respond to our messages. Pool is clean and the backyard is perfect for grilling. The amount of room and beds + the crib and bassinet made it easy for my large family to stay there, and with 2 small infants! We will definitely be back when we make our way to Laredo."

Stayed with kids","You can expect to find this home as described in the listing. The home is clean, large, and and all guests will enjoy their own private bathrooms. I have a large family and the adults were comfortably seated indoors while the children had fun in the pool under the safe watch through the glass doors and windows. The beds are extremely comfortable. I learned Annibal replaced the mattresses with Purple mattresses which I've heard of before but never actually laid on one. Well, I am a convert and plan to replace mine at home with Purple. My mother-in-law, brother, and sister-in-law (and their children) who shared the home also felt the same. The home is easily accessible from I-35 and about a 10-15 minute drive from the airport. The neighborhood is quiet. I recommend this listing for large families and would definitely consider booking this one again in future visits to Laredo."

Stayed with kids","This was our first Airbnb experience and it was beyond our expectations I want to express my gratitude to Annibal because he is an excellent host. He made sure in all ways that we had everything we needed to make the best of our stay.
The house is in excellent condition and is very specious, we had a family reunion and we all had different spaces to talk and to enjoy ourselves, the bedrooms are very big, including a bathroom for each one of the bedrooms and I wanted to point out how confortable the beds are.
The kitchen is very well equipped I can’t think of anything that we needed because we had it all. We didn’t had to much time to watch tv but the kids enjoyed Netflix, also the kids swam al little bit but the weather wasn’t ideal for the water to be warm enough to be there for long but I will say it’s a very nice pool and the barbecue area is very specious as well.
Overall our experience was amazing and if we go again to Laredo we would love to stay again in this house.
Thank you so much Annibal for everything we had a great time at your place.
If you are considering staying at this house don’t hesitate because overall it was an amazing stay. Hope you have the same experience as we did."

It’s like a jack & Jill sort of setup.

The pool is fantastic along with the covered area where the Barbecue is located. The house location is very central in Laredo- only a few minutes to shopping, eating places, the Old Town etc. Also the price is very reasonable for a group. The owner responded quickly to a small problem and fixed it immediately- very important in these type of rentals. We will return to Laredo and stay here again if it is available."

The house is very close to the mall that is very convenient for last minute grocery shopping even at the middle of the night since Walmart is 24 hours open! This huge house is very clean with all what you will need in the kitchen.
I highly recommended this place for a very enjoyable stay in Laredo! In addition, Annibal was very responsive 24 hours a day before our trip and during our trip!!! Our stay at Annibal's house could not be better."

Group trip","IF YOU’RE READING THIS, DON’T HESITATE! This is the best air bnb I’ve ever stayed at and it has everything you could possibly need. The price per person, per night breaks down to way cheaper than a cheap motel, and you get to live like a king.
The property is in a super quiet neighborhood, the house itself is beautiful and well taken care of. There are plenty of places to sit and be social, eat, watch television (he had many streaming choices available as well as good and fast WiFi!). All the rooms were spacious and had their own bathrooms, the towels were SUPER SOFT, and everything was super clean and there was no auxiliary clutter in the home. The decor is tasteful and not overbearing. the Pool is beautiful and there’s a few chairs back there so you can lay out. Also a gazebo with patio furniture and I think there was a grill too, but we didn’t use it.
The house even has 2 thermostats, a room that works for kids and babies, and the front living room has a door that closes and a pullout couch making it another sleepable room. I took this room and was more than comfortable.
I’m already looking into the dates we’ll be in laredo next year so we can book this place again.
10/10, A+++, perfectamundo!"

Stayed a few nights","We stayed at Annibal's home for five nights and absolutely loved it. Small issues with the AC and pool, but nothing he didn't rush over to fix (probably due to us being his first visitors, I think). He was attentive and friendly and allowed us to check in and check out at the times that were most convenient for us. Our party was rather large - 5 adults, 3 teenagers, and 4 kids and we all fit very comfortably! This home made our softball tournament trip much more comfortable! Highly recommended - Thanks, Annibal!"
