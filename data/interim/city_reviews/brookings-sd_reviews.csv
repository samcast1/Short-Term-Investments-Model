Stayed a few nights","Shalom cottage was such a hidden gem. I visited while in town for a wedding, and had such a comfortable stay. It felt so cozy and homey, like I was staying at my grandparents house as a kid. It’s evident that this property is a labor of love, and Karen takes great care of it.
The bed was incredibly comfortable, the alpacas were adorable, and having a hot cup of coffee on the porch in the morning was so serene. I’d never been to South Dakota before my stay, and this cottage alone is a reason to return. Thank you, Karen, for sharing your beautiful property with me!"

The bath was ginormous with the kitchenette very accommodating for us, and the most amazing part: The ALPACAS! There was a jar of alpaca treats to feed them and they love that. Very friendly and derpy animal friends. If you need a getaway or have something to celebrate, GO HERE!"

Stayed one night",Karen was an excellent host and her place on the farm is just as great! We were traveling from Mount Rushmore so we unfortunately didn’t get to the Airbnb until late that night but we had no trouble getting into the Airbnb and Karen was very understanding the next morning of our situation. Seeing the alpaca’s and feeding them in the morning was a fun experience to cap off our visit. We will definitely be returning to Karen’s place if we’re coming through SD.

Stayed a few nights","Quaint little cottage for two. Rustic feel with all the comfort amenities.
The farm is a great get away for couples or families with little ones; however, the cottage would probably be too small if more than two of you. Plenty of other options on the farm to choose from for families with children.
A short drive from Brookings (SDSU) and Flandreau.
And of course, who doesn’t like llamas, er Alpacas."

We appreciated how easy it was to communicate with Karen, she was super welcoming and accommodating. Recommendations for fellow city-folks: bring boots you don't mind getting muddy, bring your own shampoo and conditioner, and don't come expecting a petting zoo or ""modern"" decor, this is legit cottagecore."

We had a plumbing issue with the shower during our stay and she was right on top of resopnding to it. If you need somewhere to stay in this area, this is quiet and lovely! Suggest mapping to Enoch Farm vs the address so you don't end up in a cornfield :-)"

Our was stay was only 2 nights, but it was private (which I love), yet I knew close enough to the house that we weren’t totally alone if we needed anything.
The animals were great. Nice dogs with treats available inside the cottage to give them 😉 I’ve been thinking about adding an alpaca to my farm gang and these guys really made me want to go get a couple! Loved the name tags!!
We’ll be back eventually!"

The farm itself was quiet, and peaceful at night. The dogs were friendly and the alpacas.....well, they are alpacas. By that I mean, they are curious critters, but don't like to be touched. 🤣😂
Check out all 3 spaces the hosts have to offer. They are unique in their own way.
Highly recommend this place as a place to stay, and we will definitely be back some time."

Extra Blankets, Magazines, (too many to list) everything for the kitchen, it’s stocked with fresh eggs from her farm, and bacon. The Shalom Place is absolutely adorable. Great trails to walk. ( must do) We walked them at least 10 times. stunning immaculate grounds!!! when you drive up the driveway, you feel a calm ✝️ and happiness. Maybe it’s all those cute Alpacas ? You need to check this AIABNB out for a new experience
KAREN IS there if you need them .... but it’s like you have their entire farm to yourself.
So beautiful... staying again in a couple weeks. but at “The BARN “❣️perfect place to celebrate a birthday with a few friends. Such a great space.
If you ever need a small venue - you will want to book this!"

Stayed one night","Oh my gosh, Karen’s place is absolutely adorable. Located behind her house in a beautiful area of South Dakota, this place is charming and comfortable with a ton of amenities. It had a stocked fridge for us (donations accepted), alpacas to meet, and space to walk (or bike!) outside. Perfect for a solo traveler or a couple on their way through SD. Karen is absolutely lovely, kindly showed us around and checked in if we needed anything. I would give her 10 stars if I could."

The cabin is located out in the country and the property is beautiful!! Very quiet and peaceful. For animal lovers, her dog Keeba is there to greet you and make you feel right at home! (And there are alpacas, too!) It's an easy 20 minute drive to Brookings and South Dakota State University."

I appreciated the banana bread and chocolates left for me and when my car had a flat tire in the morning, Karen's husband generously put the spare on for me and directed me to a good tire place where they patched the hole. Would definitely recommend and return."

I arrived late at night and my place was unlocked with a sign outside welcoming me by name so I knew I was in the right place! She stocked my fridge and gave me little treats throughout my stay. I spent most of my time at South Dakota State and the commute was not bad and totally worth the trip. I really enjoyed Karen’s company and the beautiful retreat at Enoch farm. Highly highly recommend.

There were wonderful discoveries in creative reuse of farm buildings, repurposed and decorated with so much imagination and artistry in a beautiful and peacefully quiet rural setting. There were several alpaca including an adorable 2 week old to watch. At night be sure to go outside and see the vast prairie sky full of intensely bright stars and the Milky Way. We enjoyed a dramatic lightning show. Karen is a most welcoming and generous host....we had a wonderful stay."

Stayed one night","Enoch Farm is a treasure! We stayed in the Shalom Shack for one night—it was a last-minute snag on AirBnB, and I still can't believe my good fortune. Karen welcomed us warmly and even provided some fresh-baked scones for our enjoyment (yum!). We had all the creature comforts—lovely bed, well-equipped kitchenette, and even a TV for settling in to watch some Netflix. We had so much fun feeding the alpacas and chickens, and even took a short bike ride to watch the sunset.
Karen's spirit and hospitality made the stay so special. We loved hearing about the history of the property, plus all the faith and hard work that have gone into restoring it. I hope to come back for a longer stay as soon as I can manage it! Thanks, Karen!"

There were fresh eggs in the refrigerator and butter for frying them. Coffee and tea, cool drinks were there as well. It was fun to spend the night on a farm. We did experience some trouble finding the farm though. We arrived late in the day and our gps sent us the wrong way. Luckily there was cell service and we were able to call Karen and get directions from her. By the time we arrived, it was 11pm. Karen came out to greet us to make sure all was well. How very nice!

And with the 4 bedrooms, 7 of us from out of town had a comfortable place to sleep. The kitchen had plenty of pots, pans, dishes, etc. Plenty of space was made for us in the refrigerator. The ambience on shore of the snow-covered lake was beautiful. And bonus - Hannah was one of the most responsive hosts I've encountered. A great place to stay."

The house is so comfortable. During our 5 day stay we had any where from 3 to 9 people and we were never crowded. There are several outdoor spaces to enjoy, even a screened in patio for when the bugs are bad. The grandkids were in heaven with the trampoline and swingset.
The kitchen is fully stocked. Everything you need to cook is there including a couple of grills. We made all our meals at the house.
We have stayed in Airbnbs all over the world and this was our favorite. We are already trying to plan another trip to stay there.
We highly recommend Hannah's place and consider ourselves very lucky to have stayed there."

Stayed with kids","This house has a really beautiful location! The lake is lovely, and we saw some stunning sunsets. It was a bit of a mixed bag in other areas. I’ll start with all the good!
Pros: The house had nice spaces if you have a larger group. We had 5 adults from 3 families, so it was nice for everyone to have privacy.
The house itself was also immaculately clean. That was #1 on our list, and it delivered.
Lovely outdoor spaces: the deck off the living room had a dining space where you could enjoy the stunning views, there was a pergola with
a gas fire pit for evenings, and a screened in lower deck for when the bugs were bad.
Easy contactless check in with a keypad was great.
There were plenty of throw blankets everywhere, and extra pillows in closets. Those were really nice touches.
We loved the cute breakfast nook!
The rope swing provided hours of fun!!
Cons: The ice maker in the fridge was broken. For some this may not be a dealbreaker, but it was huge for us. It was close to 90 degrees all week, & we ended up just buying a $100 ice maker in Brookings. Being 15 minutes from town, it wasn’t feasible to just go buy ice every time we needed it. I intentionally looked at the photos before we left to ensure the fridge had an ice maker, so it was a bummer.
The advertised paddle boat did not work - only one side pedaled/steered. This was really disappointing, because it was one thing my parents would have been able to do on the water.
The central air kept parts of the basement freezing while the upstairs was really stuffy.
The downstairs bathroom was fairly unsafe - the faucet handle is broken so just spins, so whether you were getting hot or cold water was a gamble. Twice the handle came off in someone’s hand. We didn’t feel safe letting the 5 year old take a shower in that bathroom.
The shower curtain rod isn’t installed properly, so it fell and hit people in the head twice as well.
There was a random step between the basement and kitchen that several people hurt themselves on.
There was very little room in the fridge for our food, and I was surprised that so much of the owners food was in there. I understand they live there when they’re not renting it out; it just surprised me that the fridge wasn’t cleared out.
Having two family members with us who were an electrical engineer and contractor respectively, they felt a lot of things in the house weren’t up to code, so they saw things no one else probably would.
Overall, it was a decent stay, and most importantly, we got to spend a week together as a family! I think the owners got a lot of things right; for us, some of the things that were really important didn’t deliver, but for others, it wouldn’t matter at all!"

Hannah's home is located conveniently close to Brookings so getting into town to check out various antique stores and food options was very easy. The bed was very comfortable and waking up to the sun and the lake and the sound of birds was amazing. In additions the home has a lot of toys and safety features for children. No matter where you are in Hannah's home, you are comfortable and surrounded by beauty and thoughtful touches. We loved our stay and highly recommend staying in Hannah's home if you have the chance. Thank you so much!!"

Stayed with kids","The house was just what we needed. The area was quiet, both street wise and boat traffic wise. It was perfect for us and our 3 yr old. We used the kayaks, paddle boat and the rope swing. Hannah was very generous in letting us use all the lake floats, toys, etc. and our daughter loved it all. The spot on the lake was great, about a half mile morning paddle every day to the beach where we played in the sand. We also used the grill and fire pit quite a bit. We were so glad to have everything included at the house so we didn't need to bring a thing in terms of cookware and entertainment."

Lake was so peaceful and just a short drive to town.
We made sure to get back from town around 6pm every night so we could spend a couple hours sitting outside and enjoying the great views and cool breeze.
Downstairs was a hit for the kids with their own area to hang out and play. The little one just loved playing with the kitchen set and toys!
Really wished we could have stayed longer.
Hope we can get back in the near future!"

The weather for our trip wasn't great, but we took full advantage of the home amenities such as Netflix, grill and games.

For a family of nine adults, two kids (one on the way!), and four doggos, this place couldn't have been better. It was especially great for the kids, as everything is child-safe.
If you're looking for a crystal-clear lake, you won't get that here. However, the water was warm because it's a shallow lake, it wasn't overly crowded (even on a sunny Saturday), and Hannah and Adam have fun amenities for the lake (kayaks, floating rafts, ROPE SWING!).
We would LOVE to stay again and again."

Stayed with kids","We were in town for our son’s wedding on 12/30/22. A beautiful winter wonderland! Timed perfectly between winter storms. This house was very cozy and perfect for our family of 8; 6 adults and 2 children. There was more than enough room for everyone to have their own space & privacy. Actually bigger than what we needed. We played family games late into the night, with much laughter…best of all…without the risk of waking the littles🥰
The big dining room table, was a plus, we had just enough chairs (10) to invite the bride and groom over for brunch the next day🥰
The large garage was another bonus! Especially during the winter & for this special occasion.
We were so happy that we chose an Airbnb over a hotel room. We would have needed at least 3 hotel rooms and would not have been able to cook meals together, relax and create so many fun family memories!
Jeff was very responsive & answered any questions we had very quickly. We didn’t run into any problems with the house.
Thank you!"

Group trip","Jeff and his wife were great to communicate with and very accomodating. There was plenty of room for our large party. The poker table and pool table were fun to have also.
The location is great - beautiful lake and close enough to Brookings if you need to run to town and grab supplies. We would definitely stay here again!"

Group trip","Photos don’t do this house justice. It here is lots of room throughout the whole house and the game area with the pool table, cars table, fireplace, and couches is perfect for hanging out during the day. Jeff was a great host who was responsive if we were in need of anything. I would HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone looking for a winter or summer retreat with family or friends."

They said they were very comfortable and they felt very safe in them! The queen beds were comfortable with fluffy cozy linens, and the place has a lot of character and charm! We got donuts from the bakery for breakfast, which were yummy… I recommend the Bavarian cream bismark. We felt very comfortable there and got a great nights sleep! Thank you!"

Carleen was a great host, and made our stay very enjoyable.
Flandreau is a quiet, peaceful little town, with a beautiful river, and lots of interesting culture. We really enjoyed meeting and talking to different folks as hung out in town.
We were only and hour from De Smet, so we went over and visited the Laura Ingalls Wilder homstead site from the Little House on the Prairie book series while we were there."

Carleen was a fabulous host, always responsive, friendly, warm & welcoming, and full of great recommendations for nearby places to eat & drink (if you go, I'd echo Carleen's dinner recommendation of El Rinconsito, just a short block away - it was delicious!). There are a surprising number of restaurants, cafes, bars, and even a boutique taproom & live performance event space all right downtown Flandreau and within a stone's throw of the loft. I'd absolutely stay here again the next time I'm passing through the area!"

I really enjoyed going to the establishment they have downstairs. Enjoyed live music and drinks. The environment was very friendly even though it’s a “ bar” it was very family friendly. Everyone was sitting around playing games and had their children and danced. It rounded out my trip to go and relax and listen to music and have drinks and play games. I would recommend staying at this Airbnb.

I'd recommend it to anyone needing a place in the area. If you are cooking and need special appliances, check with Carleen before heading out. The kitchen cooking area is small so it only has the basics, which was just fine for us. The open layout makes it feel very spacious. The bedrooms are not huge but there's plenty of room to move."

Stayed a few nights","Cool, fun loft with great western and native American style. Extremely clean with lots of fun touches. The built-in bunk beds were adorable and would be great fun for little ones. Really nice selection of local books and games if you wanted to just hang out but also close driving distance to Pipestone National Monument and Devil's Gulch state park for outings. Beds were most comfortable I have experienced at an Airbnb. Historic building so a few rough edges around baseboards, tub, and kitchen ceiling but just part of the atmosphere of an older place. My only reason for rating this place 4/5 instead of 5/5 stars was the broken oven knob. Big reason I stay at Airbnb rentals is to be able to cook and have good meals with family and friends in a private setting. We couldn't cook half of the food we had planned without the oven. Carleen did state that she had a new knob ordered so hopefully not a problem going forward. I would definitely stay here again."

It is a spacious two-bedroom apartment over a store on the main street with a bakery and cafe and small park right nearby. The stairs up to the apartment and the charming but uneven claw foot tub might be a problem for some with mobility issues. But it was very comfortable for our family.

We loved all the little touches - exquisitely soft sheets, decor chosen to reflect the land and the people of the region, products with a purpose (bathroom hand soap that supports women who are getting out of difficult life circumstances), and just enough kitchen supplies to dine in. The stay was exceptionally quiet (which is what we needed) and the stay was a refreshing respite. We walked the Main Streets and tried out a few of the local businesses and took a day trip to shop downtown Brookings. Carleen was an excellent communicator and was so sweet and kind. Everything was exactly as she described and we appreciated the ease of everything. This will most likely become an annual trip for us!"

There isn’t that much storage space in the kitchen, so we would recommend bringing a tote or two if you plan on cooking a lot. The location is great with a grocery store, laundromat, and gas station all within a short walk/drive away. The owners of the shop below are very sweet as well. Overall we are so glad we found this place!"

Stayed one night","I LOVE THE HOST CARLEEN! The best host I’ve ever encountered! She gave us a lot of helpful tips before our arrival and all questions are promptly replied! One tip you will definitely have to listen to her is about the cops in town! We got a $95 speeding ticket for 5mph over 20mph limit. It was midnight and we were just ONE block away from the property trying to locate it! If you have a out of state license plate! Better drive very slowly!
Enough with the bad experience.
Carleens place is a gem. It’s very clean, quiet and comfortable. There’s a guitar on the wall for guest. We arrived to town around 9pm, and almost all restaurants are closed. She was so kind and asked if we need her to bring any food to us! Checked in with us time to time to make sure that we got there alright. And even after we left, she was trying to help us find a place to stay near Yellowstone park. I just love this girl!! Treats guests like friends!"

We enjoyed the pipestone monument and walk to the waterfall and had an epic night at our very first Flandreau rodeo ! Honestly, I wish we could have stayed longer and visited all the unique towns nearby. Carleen was super helpful and responsive to all my messages and was super cool when we accidentally took the remotes ! This was a truly memorable stay on our 3 week road trip cross country!"

It truly has so much space to stretch out. The view overlooking the Flandreau streets below really provide an urban feel in a quiet rural setting. One thing we particularly appreciated was the list of suggestions that Carleen, our host, left for us. It gave us a comprehensive look at the nearby restaurants and attractions to check out. We really liked the donuts from the Flandreau Bakery right next door! With all the space, the quiet setting, and the proximity to nearby Brookings or Sioux Falls, I would definitely recommend this space for pretty much any couple, family, small group, etc."

Emmett saw that one of thd kid's bike chains came off and put it on without being asked. They provided firewood and helped us get it started on one of our nights. They showed us a calmer part of the lake when the winds picked up at their place so we could continue to fish and the kids could swim. They made a list of area events going on for the kids because it got chilly for the kids in the water. The experience was true midwest hospitality balanced with privacy and peacefulness."

We have already discussed bringing the family out for another trip in the future for a relaxing vacation! Cabin was spacious and very well supplied and more than the description could have portrayed. Worth the price for a home away from home!

It was exactly what we planned for. A quiet weekend together, watching movies and laughing. The beds were very comfortable, all appliances worked, dishes were all spotless, not a speck of dust anywhere. The house itself was really cute and did feel like a home for us away from home. The neighborhood was quiet, which made for great nights of sleeping, nice location for being in town but not around the college. Molly was really quick with instructions and any questions I had for her. In the future we will be booking with Molly again for visits."

Some bathroom cleaning issues however -which she was made aware of and I believe she will rectify for the future… unfortunately her cleaners did not do a good job and she was out of town so it fell on us.

Fenced in backyard is a huge plus to anyone needing a pet-friendly place to stay. Arcade and PS3 in the basement is a huge hit with the kiddos! There are also 2 bathrooms, one upstairs and one in the basement. Kaira was super accommodating and flexible in allowing us to check out later than anticipated due to tournament games, which we were super thankful for considering we had our dog with us. Anytime we have a tournament in Brookings, we are certainly going to book this place again. Thank you again!"

We loved the backyard and enjoyed using the fire pit and grill. We had a wonderful stay and will definitely look into staying again if we are in the area."

It looks like the house might be lived in part of the time as there are a few personal odds and ins around. There are three bedrooms (one does not have a door on it) and the basement space downstairs helps the space feel bigger. Great location - 15 minute walk to downtown and a block from Hillcrest Park.

Group trip",Our friend group used this place as a meeting point for a reunion weekend as it was centrally located for all of us. The property was nice and well kept. The house was clean and updated nicely. We really enjoyed the area as it was peaceful and relaxing. The lake being across the street for us wasn't an issue since the road was actually very quiet during our trip. We had a great time relaxing on the deck and playing games in the yard. The public beach and bar/grill being walking distance was also a huge plus for us. The hosts were very friendly and extremely responsive to messages. I appreciated their openess and honesty with the post and cummication. There were no surprises. What they advertised is what we got. We would definitely stay again.

It was nice to stay together under one roof. Our hostess was very welcoming and we enjoyed talking with her. I would highly recommend staying at this Airbnb."

Room to hang out and room to have your own private time. Fire pit outside of the barn, fireplace inside the Shalom Cottage. The alpacas were adorable! The accommodations were very clean. Every kitchen accessory you could want was provided. I had a favorite mug that was there that reads,”I need a day between Saturday and Sunday’”. So true when you stay here. I can’t rave enough about the location, accommodations, and alpacas! Karen is a super-DUPER host! Thanks and many blessings to Karen and the Enoch farm.

There is plenty of space in The Barn! Be prepared for staying in an antique store of sorts. There are a lot of items with price tags ready to be sold. Although some might like this style including my mother, the extra ""stuff"" may not be for everyone. Karen and dog, Keeba, were welcoming which we appreciated. I did not appreciate the Trump sign in the front yard. As long as you know it's there when booking, you won't be caught off guard. For that reason and the antique store feel, I give this place 4 stars instead of 5."

Karen was such a great host and made sure we had everything we needed. The complimentary breakfast was definitely a bonus we weren’t expecting too! Delicious homemade cinnamon rolls and breakfast burritos. If we ever make our way back to Elkton we will definitely be booking with her again!

Stayed with kids","Such a wonderful place to stay! Truly an amazing retreat. It felt like staying in a combination of an antique shop and my aunt's farmhouse- what could be better? How about alpacas?! My son woke up the first morning there- stepped out to visit the animals and ran back in and cheered ""WE GET TO DO FARM CHORES!"" Everything was amazing- from the cozy nights under a quilt, with the bright stars outside to waking up to homemade cinnamon rolls and morning walks with alpacas and dogs. We will definitely be back!"

You are always within arms reach of a blanket or coffee cup, and there is plenty to do if you feel active instead. Alpacas are more than cute and the country road is great for a bike ride or walk."

The spaces are full of charm and life, the farm setting is beautiful, and Karen goes above and beyond in so many ways -- from the handwritten signs welcoming us to our lodging, to the treats and handmade goodies she brings, to the binders and magazines full of local tips. She even interrupted her farm chores to bring an alpaca over to our 2-year-old so he could get a closer look! The farm is a special place. Don't miss it if you're in the area!"

Stayed a few nights","So many positive things have been said; there is little else to add. One more plus that I would add is that the short amount of gravel road leading to Enoch Farm was very smooth and isn't a concern for low-clearance cars. I would like to dispel some of the claims made in Kate's review, from July 2020: Kate wrote, ""so much potpourri."" During our stay there was no noticeable potpourri, just a clean, nice atmosphere. In Karen's description of the barn she invites her future guests to, ""enjoy our vintage eclectic style"" and that is exactly what you can expect. I found Kate's descriptions of ""knick-knacks piled up"" and ""just piles of stuff to move out of the way"" to be highly inaccurate. Lastly, there are not, ""religious verses painted on every surface."" There are some verses and other quotes incorporated into the decor. The barn offers plenty of open space interiorly and exteriorly. Karen has bettered the interior space with her creative finesse since the posted pictures were taken; it is cooler than you can imagine."

Little did we know, we would be driving into a little slice of paradise. Let us just say -- we are so sorry, Karen, for being a few minutes behind checking out. We couldn't get up this morning because hands down -- that was the most comfortable bed we have slept in. We couldn't get up this morning because we didn't want the experience to end the night prior. It seemed that every time we blinked, we discovered something new in the barn. The space was brimming with eclectic individualism, history, and positivity. Relaxation came easy and the highlight of the trip was revisiting the night sky. We have forgotten what it's like to be in simple quietude.
Thank you so much for letting us in your home! We will remember it always!

There were even fresh cinnamon rolls and bacon and eggs in the fridge to make our stay more comfortable.

It might not be the most beautiful construction on AirBNB but it is a very comfortable space. There is lots of room for everyone to spread out. When we arrived we found the place was stocked with some snacks and drinking water. Check in was easy and Karen was very responsive. The only caveat I would leave is that sound travels very well inside the barn so I would suggest turning on the furnace fan to help provide some white noise. It was a perfect stay for our family of 5.

Stayed with kids","Nelsons' farm is an incredible place to escape the busy mundane 9-5 life! We came with our 2 year old and she had a blast hanging out in the chicken coop and harvesting eggs (even though a few of them didn't make it, oops). Place was incredibly cozy. Felt like home.
The day of check-out Karen took my kid out for a ride in the trunk of a small tractor. It was super fun!
One small less convenient of things - mosquitos. It was a wet hot season and we didn't totally blanked out and forgot to bring a bug repellent. So if you are stopping by sometime in the middle of the summer, grab that, it will come in handy.
Other than that, stay was perfect!
Thank you for such a lovely stay, Karen & Family!"

Not just beds, but bedrooms and a kitchen and common space with books and games and DVDs. The snacks were awesome because we were a bit of a drive from restaurants. Our kids loved the grounds with all the animals. The dogs greeted us and are well trained and don't jump up. The kids fed the chickens and gathered eggs (which we ate for breakfast) and got to feed the alpacas too. Our host even took us on a golf cart/wagon ride all over the grounds. Above and beyond, we would definitely stay here again."

It was extremely cold the day we checked in, Stacey was worried it was too cold, so she brought us an extra heater, we didn't check in until late at night, Stacey still brought us a heater. She was very responsive and very accommodating! We will definitely be back! We loved our stay and Stacey made it easy to be on vacation! Thank you!"

Stayed with kids","Stacy and Bryce have such an amazing place right on the lake. We had a winter stay due to a funeral and it was slippery out. They made sure to clear us a spot and even provided salt. Huge plus to me-gravity likes me.
When I needed to contact them with a question or two they responded almost immediately. Very clear responses, very very respectful. The house was clean and had a beautiful clean smell. There was 6 beds and room to sleep more if needed. The kitchen was fully stocked. Everything you could want or need was there. Just bring your food! They have fans in the closet if you need a fan. There’s two full bathrooms with everything you could need. Even has a washer/dryer which is a huge plus!
It was a great stay and right on the water. I would stay definitely stay again!"

Stayed with a pet","This place was exactly what we were hoping for and we’d certainly recommend it to others considering a stay! We had two adults and four kids (9 and under), plus our doggo. This was our second trip to Lake Poinsett, but our first at this house. The kids loved the bunk beds and were pleasantly surprised by the toys in one of the rooms. Kitchen was well stocked- air fryer, slow cooker, plenty of pots/pans, serving and mixing bowls. I especially appreciated all the kid friendly plates, cups, etc. The living room is set up well for family movie nights.
The house has tons of great outdoor space. And you can’t beat the sunset views from the lower dock.
Stacey and Bryce were very responsive when we had questions and even recommended a cute beach across the lake."

Stayed with a pet","The pros - This lake house was charming, and worked perfectly for our family visit. Four adults could comfortably stay here, several times we had four adults, two teenagers in the living room without feeling squeezed. Stacey was a great host, friendly and communicative. We cooked several meals and had what we needed, plenty of dishes and the dishwasher worked great. The main/master bedroom bed we found to be comfortable, but my two BILs stayed in the lower of the two other bedroom bunks and they said it wasn't very comfortable, but mileage may vary because comfort is subjective. The only con I would note is that the back main bedroom was much colder than the rest of the house. The portable CO had a thermometer that read much colder than the Nest which was outside the door, oddly. Stacey was responsive and offered a space heater, but we figured out the right setting. Another review called this a hunting cabin, this cabin is MUCH nicer than that description. We had a great stay."

Stayed with a pet",The peacefullness was amazing so where the sunsets and neighbors well worth staying a week . On a fishing note it was a few day before we found fish anyone coming to the lake to fish a sweet spot is left of the boat ramp on a gravel hump that comes up from 15 to seven feet . On staying at the cabin make sure you bring all groceries ya need mom and pop store is very nice and close but very pricey closet walmart is 30 min down I 29 . To wrap this up yes we caught lots of fish had a great time and would stay a month if we could afford to . Stacey answered every queastion we had within min. I wanna give big shout out to Stacey for letting us stay
