Stayed with kids","We enjoyed our stay and fit our family of 6 well. Beware of the glass front door, it doesn't have a way to stop it from swinging shut, thankful it was an adult who discovered this and not one of the kids. The backyard fence could use something to make it more stable as my son was outside when the neighbor's dogs charged out barking and jumped on the fence making it wobble. He quickly came inside and they didn't go out back anymore.
Great assortment of things on hand for the kitchen and having the garage access was very nice as well! We'll definitely keep the Hidden Gem in mind for future stays!"

The little fire place was perfect while relaxing watching tv.

Stayed with kids","Greeted by a very noticeable, musty odor. The home also needs a major deep clean and some TLC. The neighborhood didn’t feel the safest, especially with the cops next door most of the night. We also couldn’t get the bedrooms to cool down during the night… at one point my daughter had to go and sleep downstairs (it was SO hot) and the Mr. Cool (I think that’s what they are called) AC units in the bedrooms just would NOT stop pumping out hot air. However, the beds were clean and for the price, the house worked as a quick stop to sleep for the night and then GO. Danette was also friendly and responsive."

Thankful that the air conditioning worked well to combat the heat wave. We found a park a few blocks away that was nice to walk the dog. The neighborhood is convenient to the highway and nice and quiet. The dog in the adjoining house whined a bunch while left alone during the evening but the upstairs bedrooms were very quiet at bedtime and great for sleeping.

Stayed with kids","This is a beautiful, unique home with lots of charm. We loved looking at all of the antiques and especially enjoyed the balcony and the huge rain shower. The towels are great quality, beds are comfortable (although I wouldn't want to sleep in the bunk bed as an adult) and the kitchen is decently stocked.
It's a great house for adults or a family with older kids, but we probably wouldn't stay there again with a baby. We stayed for a week and were terrified our baby was going to fall down the stairs the whole time. There are gaps to the sides of the stairs so it would be worse than a fall down regular stairs. They did provide baby gates which we were grateful to find, but it was tricky to get a gate to stay in the right place. The bathtub is also peeling and paint got in our kids' hair, there are no plastic dishes and the yard is not great for kids.
I still give it 5 stars because it is a beautiful home and a really fun experience."

It was just as described, only better! The auto museum across the street is also amazing and was one of the biggest highlights of our trip. And they make really nice bratwurst at the cafe!
This was a lucky find and an absolute treat - we'd come back in a second.
The wifi was great and it's an excellent base for working remotely. Lots of shops and restaurants just a couple blocks away. One thing to be aware of is that the space is beautifully open, which we loved, but could make it tricky for larger groups. The upper floor is sort of like a giant (and beautiful!) loft, so it is not closed off from the main living area. As long as everyone wakes and sleeps at the same time it's no problem, and like I said for us it was perfect!"

There was an airbed supplied for use, but it had a hole it in, so didn't hold air, and that person had to also sleep on the couch. We were 8 women, and there wasn't quite enough toilet paper in the main floor bathroom. We brought some down from the bathroom upstairs.
We really enjoyed our stay. The dining table was big enough that we could all get around it comfortably for eating our meals and playing our games. Kitchen was great. Plenty big and all the utensils, etc. we needed to cook.
Great location. We went to the museum across the street, and it was fantastic. Will be going back to visit that. So much to see there.
The hostess was very informative and quick to answer questions. It was an excellent stay. We had a wonderful time."

Stayed with kids","The castle was amazing. Everything we needed from sleeping arrangements to cooking was there. The kitchen and large dining table were especially appreciated. We were able to cook breakfast and dinner and not have to spend a ton of money getting takeout for our large group. The beautiful grassy areas, front steps, and deck were so nice for a place to hang out with family outside. The coffee shop/gift shop/ auto museum across the street were incredible and so affordable. Quiet neighborhood, close enough to town for groceries/shopping and about an hour drive to Devil’s tower. We enjoyed the stay very much!"

Group trip","The photos look amazing — so amazing that they’re one reason we decided to stay in Gillette. And the house lives up to the photos!
It’s a unique place to stay, full of interesting vintage knickknacks. Everything is thoughtfully and clearly labeled — light switches, TV, garbage instructions, and so on.
The upstairs patio is a great place to sit and soak in the evening — I meditated up there several times.
The location is convenient for both walking or driving to interesting things to see or places to eat.
Loved our stay and would definitely book again if we were in town."

Stayed one night","Paula’s place is squeaky clean and exactly as it is described on her listing. The neighborhood felt safe. Keep in mind that the bed is a double bed - I am 5’4” and fit perfectly but my partner who is 5’10” had his feet hanging off. But her listing does state the size of the bed. The secondary bed is firm. The shower water pressure and temperature was fantastic! Just remember to bring your own toiletries such as body soap, shampoo, and conditioner. Plenty of towels were provided. The bathroom is shared, as stated. Having access to laundry facilities was a major bonus since we are on a long road trip.
ADA accessibility: Paula was resistant toward my service animal. Upon booking, I sent her a message regarding my service animal. She confirmed the booking. I sent a message reminding her of my service animal on the day of arrival, and she assumed I had made other accommodations since her listing does not allow “pets.” We felt unwelcome in her home. There was tension upon our arrival."

The only gripe (and not with the host or listing) is that its very hard to have mail shipped directly to the house! So if you are here and want to receive any mail/packages, it'll have to be shipped elsewhere. Luckily, the hosts also own a nearby Auto Museum and we were able to have things shipped there for us to grab later. The hosts were very accommodating!
I loved my stay! 5 stars"

Appointed with incredible and authentic museum pieces including an old switchboard, post office wall, and file folder box (with real name cards stating Supreme Court 1800's! Unlike other AirBnBs we have stayed at recently this location has real furniture that has class and style. We felt pampered staying here.
The Carter House is owned and managed by the folks that run the Frontier Museum across the street... hence the amazing decor and pieces in the space.
Truly an authentic and amazing place to stay this one is worth going out of your way to visit or making sure it is along your way so you can stay.
We felt at home and even extended our stay because we enjoyed it so much.
Briana and the team have something special on their hands. Book this and discover what I mean."

Stayed a few nights","I was slightly nervous to stay in a house filled with antiques with our children but when we got there it didn't feel that way at all! The house is old and filled with antique furniture and decor. My kids loved the record player and we had lots of fun discussions brought up by different items in the house. It was clean, comfortable and Briana was very prompt in communicating. When we got there all the lights where on which made it feel like home and that we were being welcomed in. Do not miss the opportunity to go down to the Auto museum!!! This was my favorite part of the whole trip. They have shakes, floats and malts, puzzles and antique games for kids and a record player in the corner, old movies playing in the museum and if you stay in this house your admission is free.....not to mention the museum this is the most impressive collection of cars I have ever seen and the displays are gorgeous...but it's not just cars the history is SO impressive. Loved our stay!"

It was cozy and they had plenty of AC to cool it down during the hot weather.
The beds, (ours was a sleep number!) sheets and blankets were quality, not cheap polyester like several homes we've stayed in!
There was almost Everything we needed in the kitchen except a toaster.
Quality dishes and pots and pans.
We were even given a little gift of coffee mugs with some fresh roasted coffee!
Two coffee pots, a Keurig and a regular 12 cup.
We were pleased with the home and truly enjoyed our stay.
Everyone slept well.
I would recommend this home!
Thank you for helping us enjoy getting quality time with our children and grands!!"

Stayed with a pet","Overall Danette’s place was very clean, especially the kitchen Bedrooms and bathrooms. The carpets were stained and had pet hair from previous visitors. We tried to use the vacuum and it didn’t pick up well, so maybe that is why the carpets were as clean. We have stayed in numerous airbnbs and the keypad to enter was by far the best and easiest to operate than any we have stayed at. It was great to have access to the garage because a snow storm had come through the night before we arrived and the driveway was very slippery and we were able to drive our full size crew cab 4-wheel drive pickup into the garage and be able to enter the living space through the garage."

Danette was very responsive to my messages and accommodating when we needed a pack and play. The bed in the master was very comfortable and everything was very clean! My only suggestion would be that the kitchen could be organized. Everything was available that we could need, we just had to search for it. Backyard was great for our dog, but you have to go through the garage to access it. I’d suggest bringing an extra towel to wipe paws because it was hard for them not to get muddy.

Stayed with kids","Danette’s place was probably the best option in Gillette as far as we saw. We looked at many hotel reviews and a lot of them weren’t great (talked about bed bugs etc). Danette had some pretty decent reviews and is a super host so we thought we’d give it a shot.
Overall the pros were:
-Pretty easy checkout instructions which was nice.
-it was fairly cozy (kind of like a home away from home which was nice as well).
-loved the fact that there was a rocking chair (so I could rock my toddler to sleep, it made bedtime easier).
-the bathrooms were very clean
-it wasn’t too far away from some restaurants or stores or the freeway.
-I enjoyed the Christian decor. It was encouraging.
-it was homey.
-it was À fairly quiet neighborhood
Cons:
-the bed was very uncomfortable in the master. Both for my husband and I. We didn’t sleep in the second bedroom so I can’t speak for that. I think it may have been a better investment to provide a better quality mattress and maybe even a king size mattress because the room could absolutely accommodate that size.
-bedding and sheets were seemed pretty cheap (if that matters to you at all). Not the most comfortable to sleep under.
-the kitchen and entry was was dirty. There was some gunk that looked like food and mud on the floor that I could scrape off with my nail. Gross.
-the coffee maker was filthy, with residue all in the pot and also in the area where the filters go. One part of it looked a little moldy…
-there was a screw also found on the floor that my toddler could grabbed and put in her mouth or something- not safe or good at all. Not sure where it came from. But it made me wonder if the cleaners even vacuumed.
-there were crumbs in the counter so it seems that the cleaners really didn’t do a great job at all.
-when I brought this to the hosts attention, she asked what we’d like to have done for us and I just asked for the cleaning fee to be waived. I’m not sure if we have seen that yet or not. I’ll have to double check.
-not sure if it’s really a con but perhaps something for someone to know. The home is on a slight hill and is actually a duplex unit, which would have been nice to know ahead of time knowing that the parking may be a bit tight.
-it was FREEZING when we got in the house. I thought they keep the thermostat at 70 based on the checkout/check in instructions
-we were told the cleaner came almost a week prior to our arrival- so no wonder.
We only stayed for one night because we are moving halfway cross country. Overall it was decent- clean enough that there were no bugs or anything and the bed was clean. Sad we couldn’t use the coffee maker. Just too much to deal with and so after driving 7 hours with a toddler. I didn’t want to wash it out. It looked pretty gross. Like it hadn’t been washed for a while.
Overall we appreciated the stay. Maybe this was just a one off situation."

Stayed about a week",This house was perfect for hanging out and was in a location that made it easy to get anywhere with easy access to the interstate! The beds were comfy and having 2 full bathrooms for two separate families was so nice. The kitchen was perfect for slow mornings of coffee breakfast and some work and then lunch and/or supper depending on everyone's schedule. The house was clean and cozy and it started to truly feel like home after just a couple days. I hope we can stay here again when we come back to Gillette!!

It is a darling home with everything you need, right down to something that you may not realize you might need but was there when the need arises. It's a perfect location and Danette was a great host. But the number one reason for the great review was that it is "" PET FRIENDLY"". The backyard is fully fenced so you don't have to worry about your pets escaping.
Do not hesitate to book - you will not be disappointed."

Location was great: quickly accessible to other parts of Gillette, but up on the hill, which made it feel like it wasn't in the middle of everything.

The home is very close to all of the necessities, like WalMart and food, and it was away from town enough to be close to hunting land! Danette was a very helpful host— one day we were locked out of the house after going out of town, but Danette unlocked the door digitally and got us back in. It was very convenient!
Check in and check out were very simple, just the way I like it. I would highly recommend staying here if you are looking for a home away from home while you’re in Gillette! We know we will be back to hunt again, so we would love to stay then too."

The house was comfortable but could have use a few more homey touches and a bit more furniture like chairs in the bedrooms. Overall we had a good stay. I’d recommend it. We were in town for a wedding."

I liked the convenience of the door lock. No key needed was a nice benefit. The washer and dryer were a great benefit too for a longer stay.

The place was smaller than the photos made it look. We noticed a number of ants in the kitchen and had to wash some dirty pots and pans in the drawers before we were able to cook with them. However, overall, we enjoyed our stay here and appreciate Briana’s hospitality."

The house is very close to Downtown and a 5-minute drive to all the supermarkets and service areas.
In front of the house is the museum of old cars which is the best I have seen in years and also a very cool cafe. Briana leaves you as a gift two entrances to get to know the museum , a rich welcome coffee and a rich cake.
We were able to use the garden grill for several nights and really enjoyed it.

We especially appreciated the well-stocked kitchen and full-sized dining table so we could cook dinner in and have some space for catching up on emails and the newspaper in the morning. The hot tub was a true luxury, and there is even a sauna that we didn't realize until we were getting ready to check out! It was great to have access to a drier so did not have to travel with wet suits and towels after our evening soak. The place is just around the corner from the old downtown where we poked around the shops, and we took advantage of the free passes to the museum across the street and really enjoyed the displays of vintage cars and shop spaces."

Stayed a few nights","The location is very convenient to downtown Gillette and the Cam-Plex events center.
It’s an older model basement apartment circa 1980s.
It is spacious and well equipped.
The bathroom lighting is dim.
It was a great value and great location.
The biggest drawback is the upstairs people noise. It sounded like people were coming through the roof and dogs were often barking.
I would not recommend if you can’t handle overhead noise.
But the kitchen is big, the living room is spacious, and the location is good.
There were people drag racing down the roads nearby on the weekend nights - so again - noise was the biggest drawback.
If you have a noisy crew, you’ll be fine."

The bedroom with the queen bed was accessible only through the bedroom with the two twin beds, but it worked fine for us with our two children. The back bedroom was also rather stuffy, but we found a fan in the closet and that took care of that problem! Very spacious living room and easy to access the house. One side note, the curb into the driveway is a little higher than some and our minivan had to be pulled in on an angle so it wouldn't scrape."

The place was very clean and the kitchen was well stocked with everything you need. Bring a fire stick or Raku with you as the TV doesn't have cable or antenna but the couches and recliner are great. The layout of the bedrooms are a little different as the one room has no windows and gets really warm. Also, the thermostat was already programmed and basically turned off the heat during the day so keep an eye on it.
The people upstairs own a dog which runs a lot and walk heavy so you will hear them.
I was only there for 2 nights. The beds were good and easy to sleep on."

Temperature was great for winter in living room and bedroom. Kitchen was a little drafty, probably because it's right at the entryway. There were just the 2 of us but they had 3 beds."

The how was clean and comfortable, with everything we needed in the kitchen and bedrooms. The backyard has beautiful wide open views of the Wyoming plains. Shantell's communication and proactivity was greatly appreciated.
The one piece of feedback I have for the hosts is that it would have been nice to have both upstairs bathrooms stocked with soap and shampoo. There was only shampoo/conditioner in one of the bathrooms. Still this is a 5/5 stay and I highly recommend it if are looking for somewhere to stay in the area."

The house is whites and grays so I could tell the house has just been cleaned before my arrival. The house is located on a dirt road, so I’m sure dirt would have been noticed if I had a longer stay than one night. Shantell was always fast to respond when I messaged her and was very helpful. Definitely will stay again and suggest for others."

We really appreciated how clean the bedding/ mattresses were.
The only complaints are that there were used coffee grounds in the coffee maker, the lawn was over a foot tall when we showed up and there were no serving or mixing dishes/bowls. Lastly, there was a miscommunication during our stay that was less than professionally handled and assumptions were made."

Stayed a few nights","Our stay was disappointing as this home simply did not match the listing. The home was missing a full bed, the two upstair bathroom fans did not work, there were basically no house supplies like dishwasher soap, laundry soap, kitchen supplies were non existent not even salt and pepper, poor cookwear and few plates and cups. The fridge didn't make enough ice for one person.
This home might be ok for one night but for a stay of longer than that it is not the place to go.
Our group was four adults which this home should of supported but it was not as it was missing one complete full sized bed.
The host simply needs to spend a little time insuring the home is maintained better and basic supplies are in place to make this home a viable Airbnb."

Stayed over a week","Paige was an excellent host. She was responsive and very helpful when I needed her. Every interaction with her was a positive one. The place was spotless and comfortable. I immediately felt right at home. What impressed me the most was how well stocked the place is. She has thought of everything. If you forgot something at home, odds are pretty good that she already has you covered. When I return to the area, this will definitely be the first place I try to stay."

Stayed about a week","We have stayed in several houses from AB&B and this one was in the top 5. It was so clean and homey. it's so much better than a hotel room!
Everything was described in the photo's and description points were so accurate. (and then some)
I would probably venture out to say if you forgot something they will have it for you to use.
It's tastefully decorated. Not too much not too little, quaint."

Stayed over a week","Ty's place was very clean and felt homely. He responded within 30 mins of moving in about wifi difficulties and was resolved.
It's a 2B2B apartment equipped with all things for long term stay. I stayed here solo, and would have stayed 3 more months at monthly discounted price I signed up for. All shops are approx 5-8 min drive"
