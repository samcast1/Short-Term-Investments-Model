Stayed with kids","The house itself is marvelous! We had 3 families staying here and felt that we each had our own space, yet plenty of space to all hang out also. The game room was grate fro the pre-teen boys. Spacious bedrooms and bathrooms. Great amenities! The location of the house is odd, right on the corner of a streetlight, but the secured gate that surrounds the house and yard, which is also where we park, does help. Didn't feel comfortable hanging out outside because of a lot of foot traffic along the sidewalks on the other side of the fence. Overall a great experience!"

Group trip","The house it self was amazing. The remodel of the building was done well. They have made very good use of the space. The one thing I would say is the location. There is a fence all around the property, but has a railroad changing station right where you enter the property in back of the house. The trains can be a little noisy during the night.
If you are having a large group need to stay this is the place for you. Lots of room inside and out."

Stayed with a pet","We had such a great stay here! We were there for about two weeks and Larry was responsive and attentive the entire stay. We realized our dog was getting out of the fence and he immediately had someone over to replace the broken board(s).
The house itself is super cute and very comfortable. We loved the layout and the kids loved the backyard—lots of safe room to play inside and out. We enjoyed being near the cute downtown area too.
There's some traffic and train noise at some times of the day/night since it's a corner house and a couple blocks from a railroad crossing but it sits away from that side of the lot so it still felt private. Just bring your sound machine if you're a light sleeper. Even the occasional night train did not wake the kids.
We would definitely stay here again with our family."

It’s right in downtown which from our perspective is definitely the best part of town. Amazing beer, coffee and kombucha in the Silver Grizzly local coffee shop and the house itself is recently done up and immaculate in all aspects!
Larry is super responsive and I would add very thoughtful, our baby daughter was delivered in Longview hospital during our stay and he arranged for a small gift to be sent.
Thank you Larry!!"

This home sits on a circle drive one way in one way out street so it's perfect for a little exercise around the block with your pets or for yourself. 5 minutes away from Longview's main restaurant area, shopping and a top area hospital.

Stayed with a pet","Courtney & Shane's place was great for us! We had family from several states coming to Longview to connect between Christmas and the New Year. Their place was perfect for our small gathering. I liked how bright it was, and it was also nice to know we had full use of the garage as well, which would have been amazing if it would have been super hot or rainy, but our weather was perfect. The driveway was plenty big for the cars we had, so no street parking was necessary (although there was room). We also loved the backyard for our granddaughter and her pup to safely play and run around in. Although we could hear the traffic from the main road, the neighborhood was quiet, even on New Year's Eve!"

Unfortunately this time there were large amounts of pet hair on the sheets, in closets, and in the fridge/freezer from a previous guest. To the hosts credit we contacted them and they offered to come immediately and change the sheets on the beds and do some additional cleaning. This was not a problem last time. We are aware they allow pets and have no problem with this at an Airbnb. It seems like the cleaning crew was not being thorough enough."

Group trip","It was easy to find and check in. The place is quiet, even though it is next to a laundry mat and gas station(which made me feel a little unsafe) The place was a little dark inside, but it is just an older house too. The freezer looked like it needed to be wiped out and the primary bathroom needed some body wash. I got in the shower and then realized there was no body wash in it. I also found a small worm/bug near the baseboard and there likes to be pet hair on the pillows. We did not bring our pets since the owners charge $100 per dog. A mysterious key also showed up on the front porch on the morning of our check out. It was a key to the front door and also made me feel unsafe knowing that there was a front door key just sitting outside while we were still there. Not sure that there are many Airbnb rentals in the area, but next time, we will probably stay elsewhere."

Overall, pretty decent place to stay."

Stayed with kids","This home is as described: cozy, clean, no clutter, spacious. The owners made the whole experience perfect, straight forward instructions, easy checking/out, responsive to questions pre-stay and plenty of recommendations. If you come to Longview with kids, there’s not a whole lot for kids to do so I was happy to have enough space for them to play, as well as a great backyard! As you see in the picture, the porch is the perfect place to have your morning coffee and watch the sunset in the evenings. Looks like a tin roof that covers the porch, it didn’t rain while we were in town, but I love the sound of rain on a tin roof so I would’ve enjoyed that too!"

Stayed with kids",Our hosts thought of everything we could possibly need prior to our visit and were ready to accommodate any needs. Mornings I would take my mug of coffee and sit under the covered patio listening to the playful chirps of local birds while the wind swept gently over treetops…so peaceful and reflective. Ample room inside for 4 adults and 3 rambunctious toddlers. All the comforts of home with all the little luxuries of a resort. The play kitchen in the bunk bed room was a tremendous hit and kept the little ones entertained for hours. Fell in love with the roomy refrigerator as I prepared several large trays of food to take to my son’s college. The master bedroom seemed like a secret bungalow as it blocked out many of the sounds from the main part of the house and contained a private bathroom. All in all a wonderful stay!

The showers are low, and the couch seats are small, so they are not the best fit for a tall family. They did supply some coffee, but I would have liked to have seen some sugar and creamer options."

Stayed with a pet","We are a military family and natives of Longview. Our family has grown in many ways and we felt it would be best to stay in a place of our own instead of with family for the first time. I will say it was the best decision we could've made, this place offered the space and the peace we needed to be able to truly enjoy the holidays with our children, their significant others, two dogs, and our local family members. We just so happened to visit Longview during a time when they were experiencing an unusual cold snap the temps dropped to 9 degrees at one point! I do not think the homes heating system was ready and neither were we!! The heater wouldn't heat past 65 and I reached out to the owners and they responded and had it repaired immediately. I truly appreciate their responsiveness to our needs and concerns. The house is updated and located in a part of town that I felt comfortable in. I would stay here again. (S/N: Backyard is not fenced all the way around for those bringing dogs)"

Stayed with kids","This house was cute and had so much potential. After booking, it is clear that Courtney and Shane own/rent out multiple properties, as there were multiple messages sent outlining the check-in process as well as house rules. Same thing happened before and after checkout. I can appreciate them wanting to keep guests well-informed, but the tone in some of the messages was a bit harsh, in my opinion. For example, there were many penalties laid out (Stolen towels? We will charge you $10/towel. Damage to home? You will forfeit your deposit and can possibly incur additional fees. Late checkout? We will charge you $15/15 min increments. etc etc) It was so over the top that I felt it necessary to message them the morning after we checked in to outline items that were broken upon our arrival so that we wouldn't potentially get charged for that. I have always prided myself in being a considerate guest when staying in other people's homes, so this wasn't a very welcoming way to begin the trip. HOWEVER, I do understand that not everyone is the same and they are just protecting their assets.
As noted, there were quite a few items that were broken when we arrived - crooked cupboards that wouldn't close, guest bath door wouldn't close all of the way, toilet paper holder hanging from the wall, etc. To their credit, after I notified them and sent pictures, they quickly replied and said they were aware of some items needing correction and would add the others to their repair list.
The location is fine. We were about five minutes away from our family's home, so that was convenient. The house is at the front of a neighborhood located directly next to a washeteria and a gas station, so take that as you will. We didn't have any issues while there, but I was very grateful for the garage where we parked our car throughout our stay. The neighborhood stayed quiet.
I read a recent review about a brown recluse issue - we didn't see any bugs throughout the duration of our stay, so I assume that problem was rectified. I did agree with that poster on the living room couch - it is extremely uncomfortable. The master shower is quite short (I'm 5'9"") and I had the same issue as a previous poster with trying to figure out which gel was the shower gel/shampoo and which was conditioner. Not a huge deal, they both smelled fantastic. :)
We (and our toddler) appreciated the play kitchen that is stored in the guest room to keep her busy in the mornings and the evenings before bath time.
The house is extremely spacious - it's an older ranch home, so the rooms and closets are large. I really liked the layout of the home. The back patio is a nice add, although we didn't use it, and I like the option of bringing your dog (although we didn't take advantage of that). The yard is a nice size and is enclosed/fenced. The laundry room/mud room is gigantic.
Overall, this was an OK stay. The owners did a good job with renovating the exterior and parts of the interior. I did feel as if the home is represented in a more modern way in pictures than what it actually is. The bathrooms are in serious need of updating. There is definitely room for improvement, but it isn't a bad place."

Stayed a few nights","I don’t ever leave reviews but feel this one is needed for others safety.
Cons: I was bit three times by a brown recluse while sleeping in the bunk bed room. I’ve had to go to the Dr for ointment and pain due to the bites which has resulted in me missing work. If I’m lucky it will take a couple of weeks to heal. If not so fortunate I will have to go back to have the section cut out of my back and leg. I’m glad this happened to me and not my son or another child. Please have the house treated.
Master bedroom mattress is horribly uncomfortable and the bed frame squeaks with each move. Master bathroom shower is made for a short person, I’m 5’6” and had to bend backwards to wash my hair. The couch is also extremely uncomfortable, it’s very hard. Shower gels are a nice touch except they’re not labeled so you don’t know which is body wash vs shampoo/conditioner. The house is right next to a laundry mat which brings in questionable people.
Pros: AC works great. The house is cute with so much potential. Plenty of room. Check in was easy.
Overall I would not recommend staying here. I can overlook the uncomfortable couch and bed but I cannot get past being bitten by a brown recluse."

They came and took a look at it fixed what they could at the time. Still issues in the home which the owners are aware of. Would be nice if the beds were softer the beds are very hard in the guest bedroom and the master bedroom. The children’s room for their beds were very nice , the children had no complaints. Would be a five out 5. Star Pl. to stay if the plumbing & Comfort & softness of beds, was better.

We were incredibly fortunate as Lee's place was one of the few locations that had power. This meant that we could enjoy the refreshing coolness of the air conditioning despite the scorching 99-degree days. Our family and friends in the vicinity were envious and eager to visit us, seeking respite from the intense heat. The central location of the property made it convenient for everyone. The accommodations were cozy and provided ample space for us to relax and move around comfortably. When we return to town for another visit, staying here again will definitely be on our list of considerations."

Stayed a few nights","This was the perfect location for our needs. We had a family wedding with lots of back and forth to events over 3 days. It was wonderful to be able to come to this tiny home and have a comfortable place to sleep and rest. Everything was exceptionally clean, and the decor is farmhouse modern…very cute. Would stay here again if we have need in the area. Thank you to Barry who responded immediately to questions before and during our stay. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"

There were some larger spiders, but when I reached out to Barry he was responsive and let me know they were taking care of it for future guests. This is a deal if you are looking for a quiet place to lay your head while in the Longview/Kilgore area."

Stayed over a week","This is my first ab&b stay.
Cheapest last minute option, decent, private, but I should have found a place closer for my needed transit. And, it is not for someone with bug issues. Crickets and ants come out of the framework, and flying insects invade when opening the door. I managed.
More or less served its purpose. I was unfortunate to book time when construction started next door (only 2 days of 11). Airport is small, so really no issue with noise.
I don't like hazelnut coffee, so bought my own. Instant oatmeal was present but didn't use that either. Plates are plastic and marked on bottom ""not for microwave."" Again, used my own.
Please mark the address clearly. (No numbers found to match)"

This property is close to Longview for any college or family events, as well as close to the lake. Communication was friendly, responsive, and proactive. If you ever have a need to visit the Longview, Texas area, I would recommend staying here. So many amenities that you can't get at a hotel for a very reasonable rate. Barry and family...it was great! We want to come back for the balloon festival next year and stay here again!"

And exactly what we were looking for. The house was incredibly clean. The kitchen was very well stocked with cooking utensils. The area was quiet and welcoming. The host was very responsive and proactive. They always let us know if anyone was coming by for yard work or anything else. We had a fantastic time and loved the house! We try to visit the area once or twice a year so we will definitely be hoping to stay again! Thank you for the great experience!

Chinmay was an amazing host and went out of his way to help me. I accidentally put the wrong dates and Airbnb was going to charge me over $600 but Chinmay called them and i was refunded in full. I haven’t had any other host that really went out of their way to help when it didn’t benefit them. I will never forget it. Also, my last visit was at a different property of the same host. I left my gold earrings and he mailed them back to me. I didn’t realize i had left them but he sent me a picture of them. I will only use Chinmays properties when I return to Texas. Honest and kind!"

Group trip","I booked this stay for my family and I because we were in town for a family reunion. My parents can be very picky when I comes to cleanliness and safety so I was hesitant to book a location that would provide everything we needed to make our trip comfortable. However, Chinmay’s listing exceeded all of our expectations. The house felt extremely safe with the security system and location. The instructions were abundantly clear and made me feel at ease throughout the entirety of our stay.
Furthermore, the home was the cleanest I’ve ever seen at a bnb. Spotless. Could it have felt cleaner. Cherry on top was the exact amenities needed to make the space feel like home.
Lastly, I had to work during our trip and the dedicated office table and chair was the right amount of space to do just this. However, there was ample space for me to work from without the worry of waking anyone up or being in the way.
Would absolutely book another future stay!"

Also the house was clean and ready for us to enjoy the moment we walked in. We didn't get spend as much time at the house as we would have liked but we did enjoy the quiet comfortable feel of the house -- like being at home type of comfort.
And just as important, the house is in a quiet, well-kept neighborhood that felt safe.
We enjoyed our stay there and hopefully we will be able to travel back to TX in the future and once again stay here while we visit our family.

The back porch was lovely and the living room, dining room and kitchen were so well apppointed. The ‘s’mores fixings were a delightful touch and we thoroughly enjoyed playing with the provided cornhole setup. We know we will be back to Longview and hope to stay here again."

Simple, clean aesthetic. This was our second stay in less than 6 weeks. Unfortunately we were there for my dad’s funeral. Nagelle was kind enough to leave a sympathy card and allow us to have family over after the service for lunch.
She was very responsive and proactive. The Wi-Fi went out and we didn’t even have to reach out to her. She got a notice and she reached out to us with a simple solution to get it back on board.
Highly recommend! When we find ourselves back in Longview this is definitely where we’ll stay again."

We each had our own room with plenty of space to gather for meals and games. A huge storm chased us into town and we were able to park inside the garage to protect the car from hail damage. The screened in room was great for a late night glass of wine with the sounds of nature singing beautiful music that brought back so many childhood memories of growing up in East Texas. Nagelle was quick to respond and her place is even better than the pictures. Highly recommend a stay here if you are visiting Longview."

There is Central air but I think the temperature must be controlled from one of the other units as I couldn't find a thermostat, but there was also a window unit if needed. Huge plus that I was able to bring my dog. It worked out perfectly for what I needed."

Stayed with kids","We enjoyed staying here. The backyard is beautiful and big! It is the perfect yard to throw a football, kick a soccer ball, play tag…
I think it’s a fairly new rental and they are probably still in the process of getting a few things. The kitchen had all of the basics you would need; but didn’t have a lot of other cooking items. But- it was actually a treat to eat out all of meals! And if you happen to be going to wedding at Dove Hollow then this house is a great location- nice and close. Also, there were plenty of wonderful bath towels and wash cloths; but there weren’t any hand towels. There was a hand towel ring- so I’m guessing that they just hadn’t gotten around to getting them yet. Really not a big deal though since we could dry our hands with the bath towels. All in all, everything worked, it was clean, the a/c worked and we all had a great time."

The host's amenities were spectacular -- they truly thought of everything you might need during your stay. The kitchen is well-stocked, and the place could not be cleaner. The outside is nothing to look at, especially the grass and shrubs, but once you get inside you will be glad you rented the place. The host could not have been more helpful and kind, and we look forward to staying here again when we're back in the fall. This is likely in our Top 5 Airbnb places we've stayed at globally!"

Stayed a few nights","Our original Airbnb host cancelled our booking, and the host of this Airbnb was a huge blessing! We were worried we might have to completely cancel our trip to see family we hadn’t seen in three years and a new grand baby. The host of this Airbnb took our last minute booking and had the place pristine by the time we arrived. She made sure everything was right and went above and beyond, including fresh cookies that were a hit. We had a minor issue with the front door locking system, and as soon as I texted and made her aware, she responded and fixed the issue.
The location its self is a smaller Texas town, and the area around the Airbnb was very quiet and we felt safe. It was big enough for our family to hang out during the day, yet quaint and homey feeling. We would highly recommend you use this Airbnb if you’re staying in the Longview area!"

Highly recommend if you are traveling with a little one. The kitchen and washrooms were equipped with everything you would need.
Carolyn was extremely accommodative and responsive to all our needs and queries, and made our stay very smooth. Thanks Carolyn for all the help.
If I had to share any feedback, there would be 2 things:
1. There is no microwave in the kitchen, so heating up food every time was a huge task. A small microwave in the kitchen could go a long way.
2. Maintaining the garden and front yard: The house would be even more comfortable if the garden was cleaned and well maintained."

The house was charming and extremely welcoming, We had every item that you use at home. I was shocked at how they thought of all our needs. The bed was unbelievably comfortable. I have severe back issues, and I slept all night without pain. The dining room table was ready with place mats. I never had such a wonderful experience when we travel. We are working, so a comfortable place to stay is necessary. We have booked again for all our shows in Longview."

If we had a larger group we would definitely have rented the whole house, with the upstairs rooms also, but the main downstairs level had everything we needed. Rodney was communicative and always helpful. We would definitely stay again if we were ever in the area again! It was probably my husband and my favorite airbnb rental and we have stayed in A LOT!"

The farm house Cottage decor was lovely. I so enjoyed the beautiful flowers outside in the front and back yard. My 2 grandsons came over twice and loved the beautiful back yard . even did a little yard work. Beds were good, Loved special little soaps in bathrooms. his sweet barn cats greeted us in the mornings SORRY we were little late leaving my daughter in love wanted pictures of the boys on the porch swing & It took a little longer than we hoped. But we got to meet Rodney in person , he's such a personable man and puts a lot of his self in to the atmosphere of place. We will be back ."

Everything about the home is comfortable and inviting. There is quite a bit of nighttime traffic at the intersection, so it might be necessary to turn on the bedroom window unit air conditioners to mask that occasional noise. For those missing pets back home, there are some very healthy cats that come to the front porch expecting a meal- cat food and dinner service provided in the kitchen. A great location just far enough away from the hustle and bustle of Longview."

It is a beautiful little farmhouse, perfect for a quick get away. Everything was clean, they provided us so much information on what to do around town (things we didn’t even know about), and they were extremely welcoming and communicative the whole time we were there. When we come back to Longview, we will definitely be stay here and I highly suggest it for anyone else."

Can't say enough about the value of staying in such as wonderfully decorated home over a boring hotel room! Others have mentioned the four-way stop. We didn't find it very destracting at all since most traffic died down once it got dark outside. Rodney, Priscilla, and Shelly did a great job of providing a warm and welcoming home away from home. I miss Sandy and Smokey (the outside house cats) already. We'll be back for sure."

Very comfortable and peaceful. It was kept clean and i have to laugh at the two cookies. They were so pretty I thought they were magnets until I saw my husband eating one. Everything was well thought out to make it feel like home. I thought the dog dish and biscuits was super sweet for us dog lovers. We stayed during one of the hottest weeks, it was 100 degrees one of the days, but we were comfortable. It's on a country intersection but still quiet and didn't bother us."

My husband and I had the whole downstairs which had two bedrooms and two bathrooms which, for two people, felt rather luxurious.

I found this place and I was impressed. Lots of space, very clean, huge yard with a cool place to chill in the back. The front porch was great! Beds were comfy, smart TV was great for kids shows on demand. I was very happy with our stay and our host was very quick with communication. Stay here if you get the chance!

Stayed one night","This place is everything! I am from the big city so this was a lovely quiet getaway not even 4 hours from home. Pulling up to the home is beautiful, like a blast from the past! Very elegant, yet chic. Then you get inside and the patterns are farmhouse/country chic with elongated wood floors stretch all the way back through the house, with the first bed room and living room on your sides. You keep walking in and there is a stunning kitchen filled with lovely snacks and views the you can easily enjoi. And across from that, the second bedroom! There is also a very lovely sitting area out back and as well as upfront where you can just lounge about, and enjoi the evening. All in all this place was enchanting! The inside was very nicely decorated. There were sighs in numerous places that help you navagate around the house such as ""Welcome"", ""Wifi password is _____"", ""Excuese the mess! This area is closed due to remodeling"" and ""Farmhouse"". Things along those lines. It was very cute and very appreciated! I could go on and on about how lovely this place is, but I'm not one for too many spoilers! Go see for yourself and fall in love with the countryside for a weekend! You'll love it!"

They have made great renovations which allow for modern luxuries, at the same time they preserved the historic feel of the home. Literally, my wife and I cannot express how much we recommend this home. The beds are comfy, and wifi allows you to keep up with your favorite Netflix show. The front porch is gorgeous and the back porch has lights strung around it, comfy chairs, a firepit, and a charcoal grill. We grilled fajitas and had a good time around the fire with friends.

Group trip","I was so pleasantly surprised with this house. Not only did it match the pictures and descriptions, but it had positive surprises like laundry detergent and 2 washers, a nearly fully stocked kitchen equipped with ice, a dog bowl for my fur babies, dog treats, and dishwasher detergent. We literally only had to bring shampoo and conditioner. Everything else was there. The house was so clean-not even a spec of dust! The ceiling fans were on and some lights and the AC had cooled the house. We arrived and felt welcomed. The beds were comfy. Coasters would have been nice in the rooms since everything condenses in the humidity but that’s not a huge thing. The shower only bathroom door kept popping open even when locked so we got creative to let others know it was in use. I appreciated the fenced yard for kids and pets. We enjoyed the fire pit and lounge chairs out back. And of course the front porch swing! Upstairs had window units for air that worked great and kept the noise of the road dwn"

There are 2 sweet kitties that live outside but were very dog savvy and steered clear of them when they were in the yard. As other reviews have said, the intersection outside is very busy and you can hear a random car here and there. We just turned on some white noise and the a/c in our room and it was not an issue. We would definitely stay again when in town!"

Group trip","We were so excited to arrive and see all the space. The pictures online do NOT do it any justice. We stayed because our daughter got married at Reserve Event center and needed a place with space that wasn't too far away. When we arrived and realized it is 2 story with all the room, we were so excited. My mom had room to finish final alterations on wedding dress and bridesmaids dresses while my sister had plenty of room to decorate the cake. In the mist of all this chaos, we were very thankful for all the Christmas decorations which just reminded us of the season and to take a deep breath in that moment. We felt we were in a Hallmark Movie and everything was very heartfelt and touching.
We did not have any issues, but did reach out to host a couple of times with questions and he responded very quickly each time."

Having both central AC/Heat AND the window units was awesome as each guest can customize their own room. LOTS of nice pillows and covers on the beds.
The yard cats were very cute and friendly.
Rodney was super responsive and very very nice.
My only suggestion is bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper. The house is on a 4-way intersection with a stop sign. I was the only one in our group that had issues but I'm a super light sleeper."

Group trip","The Grable Creek Farmhouse is full of character. We enjoyed the historic details of the farmhouse's original segments!
Guests should be aware that most closets in the home are rustic and not suitable for hanging a wedding gown or other formal clothes. In addition, the 2 upstairs closets are only half height. Only one closet in the home (within the queen-sized bedroom on the 1st floor) is suitable for hanging wedding attire.
If you have elderly guests in your group, please note that a large, high step separates the main floor's queen-sized bedroom from the rest of the home. It could be difficult for elderly guests to navigate. We chose to switch rooms so grandpa didn't encounter trouble with a misstep."

I would recommend providing more kitchen towels and wash cloths. I would recommend providing the renters with a broom, dust pan and/or vacuum. With the kids in the house, there were crumbs everywhere and we really needed something to clean that up. My sister wanted a washer and dryer however it didn't bother me b/c I wasn't going to spend my vacation doing laundry :-). Overall, lovely time beautiful house and gorgeous landscaping. Thank you for the hospitality."

Group trip","Eight of us stayed at the house and several more joined us for a LeTourneau graduation party. Everyone slept very comfortably, and we were easily able to prep food for the party in the compact but very functional kitchen. We loved the charm and history of the home, and how we felt completely out in the country but were only minutes from town. Our reason to visit Longview has now graduated, but if we find ourselves back in the area, we would definitely stay again. Texas countryside at its finest."

We loved the front and back seating areas for sitting out in the afternoons and evenings.
Plenty of parking and remote enough to enjoy our privacy, but still close enough to Longview and Kilgore to find plenty of places to eat when you didn't feel like cooking."

Our group of seven plus two fur babies were able to spread out, relax, and enjoy the little time we had between events for a family wedding and Dove Hollow Estates. We enjoyed walking through the house and imagining what it once was like when it was a general store. Rodney, the host, was quick with replies to any queries we had. If you need somewhere to stay in that area, we all agree that this is well worth every penny."

The bathrooms are not connected to a bedroom and are on the first floor which worked well for our group because there was always one available. Property is on a road corner with fair amount of fast traffic, need to be careful with little ones in the front yard. Back yard is safe. There are fans in every room for climate as well as noise control. This place was very clean, well furnished and decorated, and I’d live in it in a heartbeat!"

There was much laughter at the table as they enjoyed each other’s company on our first evening. Overall it was a huge success!! If we needed a spot in this area again, we would choose this same place!"

Stayed with kids","The farmhouse is lovely with four/five bedrooms as there's a room on the landing with a drop-down sofa bed that can serve as a 5th bedroom. (You just have to go through it to get to the king-size bedroom upstairs but it was perfect for our 9 year old grandson who wanted to be near his parents in the adjacent room.)
The house was charmingly decorated for the holiday season. It was cold when we arrived and it took awhile to heat up the house which is reliant on floorstanding space heaters/window units. Once we figured out how not to trip the circuit, it stayed warm.
You feel like you're out in the country even though it's not far from the I-20. It's on the corner of the intersection of 2011 and FM349 which is an established truck crossing. The house is easy to find because the street sign on the corner actually says 7830 FM349, plus the front porch faces 2011 -- it looks just like the photos."
