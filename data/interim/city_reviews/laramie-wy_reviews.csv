It featured all the amenities from the listing and we were very thankful to be able to use the washing machine. Heidi and her father-in-law were very responsive and friendly. Our only 'issue' was that the heater was a little noisy at night but it stopped when we turned it off. Overall, we'd recommend it!"

Stayed one night",The Gibbon’s Place was the perfect Airbnb for our stay in Laramie. We were in town for a Uni of Wyo football game and easily walked to and from the stadium and were a short drive from the Walmart and downtown (could’ve walked to downtown if we had more time!) The downstairs unit had everything we needed and was decorated nicely. We loved the original pine paneling.

When you stay here, leave your car parked and walk through the neighborhoods/town. The murals are amazing!"

Stayed a few nights","Heidi’s place was perfect for my short stay in Wyoming! I personally needed a place to stay during my trip from Colorado to Wyoming that wasn’t too far from the Denver airport and Heidi’s place was the perfect location for me. I didn’t realize how close the University of Wyoming was to the house, it was a pleasant surprise and I enjoyed walking around the campus when I had some down time. The place itself was incredible, very clean cozy and spacious I would have loved to have been able to stay longer and would definitely come back if staying in Wyoming again. Heidi and Dave were very helpful throughout my stay and were kind enough to show me how to use their washer and dryer. Everything you need is about a 7-15 minute drive which was so great and I loved walking around the town to see all of the local shops. Overall, great experience would stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","""Oh wow..."" were the first words out of our mouths upon entering Heidi's place. A narrow flight of wooden stairs leads to the basement apartment which we found to be quiet, well-appointed, clean, and larger than what the photos suggest. We found a welcome tray with chocolates and instructions on how to use the Wi-Fi and suggestions for restaurants and activities in the area. The apartment is spotless, and you can tell the Host pays attention to detail. The bed linens and towels are of good quality, and everything was in working order. Because it is a basement unit with a few small windows and wooden wall paneling, it is a bit dark. However, if you allow yourself to travel back in time to your very first basement retreat where you could escape from your parents and create your own kingdom, then you will feel right at home. And because this retreat includes a full-size refrigerator, stove and oven, microwave and coffee maker, you may never want to leave!"

We ended up in the basement and the people in the upper had a small child that woke at 6am. There was more noise than we expected. You might want to check who is going to be above you if you are in the basement. We met Heidi and she was a very lovely person.

Stayed a few nights","The Gibbon Pad is a stylish basement apartment and we really enjoyed our recent 3 night stay! When we arrived, we had just been camping and road tripping, so having a full kitchen and bathroom and all the beautiful spaces to relax within the apartment was simply luxurious! Contactless check-in and check out was super easy. If you are a light sleeper, consider bringing earplugs or booking another of Heidi's units. As this is a basement apartment of an older home, you will likely hear footsteps and voices from the upstairs unit. I always sleep with earplugs anyway (snorty French Bulldog at home!) so it didn't affect my sleep, but my husband had a hard time sleeping with the noise from above. Overall, a great value, wonderful host with clear communication and a great location in Laramie. We'd love to come back and try staying in one of Heidi's other units next time we are in the area. All her spaces look so beautiful from the pictures!"

Even though it’s close to the university, it’s in a very quiet neighborhood. Check in was a breeze and the amenities gave the feeling of being at home. 10/10 would recommend!"

The twin cot fit well in the living room and seemed comfy for our child. We needed additional towels and toilet paper during our stay, and Heidi delivered them super quickly. The apartment was as described and felt private and secure, easy parking was appreciated. We also enjoyed hearing/seeing the chickens in the yard. I'd definitely recommend Heidi's place for a visit to Laramie!"

The place was very clean, modern, had everything we needed to feel at home, and was an easy walk to all the sites we wanted to see. Also close to a big supermarket which was handy, and few steps to dozens of restaurants and cafes. Communication was great too. We would highly recommend this wonderful apartment."

Overall, I loved my time at the Rustic Hollow and will definitely stay again if I am in town."

Samantha was very responsive for questions we had when booking and other like parking etc. There is some road noise noticeable at night but she was upfront about and provided ear plugs if needed as well as a white noise machine, I carry one with me and when on I did not hear anything. Thanks so much for a comfortable, convenient place to stay and see you soon."

Great view of the local area. Samantha's home is very comfortable. The only downfall was the construction in the front. Hopefully it is done soon, because you do have to park a couple blocks away. I would suggest parking to the street only 20 yards away and taking your luggage to this front door in front of the street not in the back alley. Those steps are not as steep as the back ones. Then go move your car. Samantha provides esr plugs and a sound machine if any type of extra noise bothers you. We are early risers so we would have avoided any of the construction sounds.Great place to stay overall. Very clean and close to about everything you would need."

Even with construction going on on the main road Samantha did a great job of relaying parking recommendations, as well as being very quick and responsive. She had cute recommendations for places downtown, including drink coupons making it so fun to visit new places! Highly recommend this place to anybody wanting to explore downtown Laramie!"

Stayed one night","Beautiful, unique place but there is massive construction going on right outside which limits the parking availability and messes with the hot water for taking a shower.
None of this was specified until after the reservation was made and paid for.
I would have gone with a different place if I was aware of this predicament. Everything else was great!"

Stayed one night","We had a wonderful stay in Laramie.
My wife and I booked the two bedroom apartment knowing that it was more space than we needed because we loved the location.
We were within a block or two of all of the downtown restaurants, bars and the farmers market.
We did have to park a couple blocks away because of a major water main break but that was not the host’s fault and she provided us with numerous alternative options for parking.
We appreciated her thoughtfulness."

The only issue was in front with the water main being replaced. Can’t blame the hosts on this and hopefully it’s done soon. Would definitely utilize this space again though as it’s extremely clean and was great for our family of 5! Thanks for everything Samantha!

The space was perfect for my mom and I passing through - quiet and private and in a good part of town (unfortunately because we got there Sunday most of the shops were closed). Only caution would be if you have problems with stairs - they can be steep. Thank you for the Hershey's Kisses - definitely needed those after a long drive!

The description is exactly what you get. We stayed for 4 days in downtown laramie, very small cute city.
The only con was there was construction going down on the Main Street and had to park 2 blocks away. If you travel light no issue. If you have to buy essentials water, food, etc you will get a workout especially with kids. Overall, great experience. Thank you"

The queen bed was a little soft for us- but that is just us- we like hard beds. The owners were absolutely lovely. We were planning on holding a largish graduation party in a local park, and when weather did not cooperate, the owners were very cooperative about us moving the party into our unit, and their beautiful back yard. The art work in the unit is also lovely- most of it painted by the owners. The kitchen has about everything you need. Parking is on the street, in front of the unit."

Sketch pads and pencils on the table for guests to use was a really nice touch.

Very comfortable living area for visiting with our sons. Linens and beds were wonderful.

Everything was spotless in the house! Would highly recommend staying here if going to Snowy Range for the weekend. It’s a quick 40 minute scenic easy drive.
Only thing to be aware of is the house is a duplex with a permanent tenant living below. There are two separate entrances so paths don’t cross but can hear the other tenant below at times and likely vice versa. Was not an issue for us but may be for others who are not expecting to share a house, even if the levels are separate. Overall, still highly recommend staying here!"

We had troubles with the Spectrum WiFi not working but Heidi responded very quickly when we reached out and provided us with their new fiber WiFi and it worked great!
This residence is above another connected residence but we didn’t notice them more than hearing them open/close their front door a few times while in the living room.
Parking passes were provided for us to park in the street in front of the house. The house is within 5-10 min of many fast food places/restaurants too. We will book again if we end up visiting Laramie in the future! 😊"

The reason for 4 stars is parking pass instructions weren't clear and we got a parking ticket. After we reached out and let her know, there was no reply for over 12 hours. It is also listed as an entire home to yourself but that is not true. It is half of the upstairs section of a house with a door that connects you to the other half and their guests. you can hear them talk and walk and do everything."

House was comfortable. The whole place was immaculate. They even had the ceiling fans on and a screensaver of some fish on the TV when I arrived. Price was much cheaper than what I would have paid at any of the nicer hotels in the area and I got more out of staying at this house than I would have staying at one of them. For those doing anything at the college, it is all of 3 blocks away from the main campus and maybe a five minute drive to the stadium or arena. I would definitely not hesitate staying here again if I see it open on any of my trips up there."

It was extremely clean, very comfortable and well appointed. Heidi was very responsive and kind when I reached out via phone with a special request. If I ever come back to Laramie, I know where I'm staying! Thank you, Heidi."

Stayed a few nights","My husband, adult son, and I stayed at the Gibbon Getaway for 5 nights. It was wonderful in so many ways. The house is pristine and very nicely decorated in a modern farmhouse style. The beds were very comfortable and linens were fantastic. I loved that the university is only a few blocks away. An easy walk gets you to their museums and the plant conservatory. My suggestion is that if you're traveling with small children, this may be not be the best choice because this unit is above another basement rental unit. We were careful to be quiet but we never even heard the other guests. There is another unit they rent on the property that's totally separate that would be a good option. I can't say enough great things about this rental and the hosts themselves. Wonderful."

Parking was easy. You can walk to town.
The cleaning fee is low ($25 during our visit) & we were asked to strip the beds and do the dishes; that is the ideal price point for what we were asked to do. Other hosts have asked 4x as much and it makes me so mad. No issue with Heidi’s check out procedures!
Thanks so much. Highly recommend this place."

Stayed a few nights","This was my first time using Airbnb . The place was located close to all the places I needed to be and having the decent sized kitchen was great in terms of what I needed and what I wanted to accomplish while there. Was able to pull off a surprise birthday breakfast, twice. And the place was so inviting and comfortable that the kids spent the majority of the time I was in Laramie at “ my place”, sharing meals, playing cribbage and just hanging out. The only “problem” I had was with the wi-fi and TV options. But when I contacted Heidi to ask about it, she was willing to come by and try to get the better option working in the unit. We were able to make the wifi better enough the kids could do their online work for class, but we’re still limited for streaming/TV options. Heidi mentioned she would be addressing that in between renters. Overall, it is a charming, comfortable and well-located place and Heidi was a very responsive and helpful host. Especially for someone who was new to Airbnb and had lots of questions. I know I will look for it again should I visit my nephew in Laramie again."

We were able to find another weekend that worked and it was so worth it! She is VERY communicative and checked in on us several times throughout our stay. The house is well stocked for a family with kids and had the perfect bed/room set up for 4 adults and 2 kids. One note is that there is no stove/oven, but there is a hot plate and so we planned dinners around that knowledge. It’s VERY clean and well kept. Highly recommend!!"

There are several sleeping options, but my husband and I chose the private bedroom with the king sized bed. Wonderfully soft mattress! The location was about 3/4 mile from all the action of downtown.

She took the time to reach out with route recommendations, road conditions and a link to Wyoming Road Conditions website. She checked in on our progress and made sure the house was ready for our arrival. She had the lights on and the heater running. I was happy before we even set foot in the house. And that’s saying something because this home is beautiful! It looks exactly like the pictures. Every detail has been taken care of - there was ice in the freezer, games in the closet, spices in the kitchen, extra blankets in the living room, ample towels in the bathroom, toiletries in the shower, a first aid kit, and toys in the children’s room. She even has multiracial baby dolls! It is evident that Seiley takes pride in providing an amazing experience for her guests. I anticipate many return trips to Laramie over the next 4 years.

The home is small, but was perfect for our family of 3 (it would be plenty big for a family of 4-5). Seiley went above and beyond with so many little things around the home like extra soaps, chargers, water and snacks. The house was also very accommodating to children. The home was well cared for, very clean, and very well stocked."

Stayed with kids","Lovely stay! The house is beautifully decorated, very clean, super comfortable beds. We all slept great! My kids (4 and 6) were completely thrilled by the bunk beds, toys, and books. Hostess has not forgotten anything- snacks, cups, variety of drinks, toiletries, bedding, family games, fan, anything for kids/baby, and more. Sadly we basically only slept and showered here as our days were completely full out and about, would have loved more time to enjoy the cozy space together. The check-in keypad was super easy and nice to use. Neighborhood felt very safe and was totally quiet during our stay. Easy drive to Cheyenne. Although we needed nothing during our stay, Seiley was very communicative and I don’t doubt we would have been well taken care of had anything come up. Perfect stay for our young family of 4 and could easily accommodate a few more people. Thank you!"

The bunk beds worked perfectly for the kids (there's even an extra mattress stowed under the bottom bunk that you can pull out so you don't have to worry about anyone falling, which no one did by the way). Everything was so thoughtfully set up. It was great to have the bath toys and story books for the kids! There were also nightlights in the kitchen and bathroom. The bed in the master bedroom was super comfortable. It was also very centrally located. There's a great park just a couple of blocks away where our kids had fun playing with the water spray. We also walked with our kids to the UW geology museum nearby to see the dinosaurs. When we return to Laramie, we'll definitely try to stay at Seiley's again. Thanks for everything!"

We are used to stripping down all the beds so we weren’t for sure if we needed to do that but she was quick to respond and let me know what she wanted me to do before we left (although I think I forgot to empty the bathroom trash in our 4am departure). Beds were comfortable and plenty of blankets for those that are coming from super hot weather and thinking they will be just fine and they wake up to 46 degrees! We had never been to Laramie and we were there to check out your little town to see where our daughter will be spending her next four years. It was beautiful and everyone was very friendly.

Fabulously comfortable bed and couch and stuffed chairs. Wall art and books are local and great references when on the road. The bathroom with tub and tons of extras are supreme. The muffins, fruits and any pot, pan or cooking utensil you could want are behind the bar in the kitchen...it's all there and more!
Well worth the price. She should charge twice what she does. An oasis, friendly and intelligent hosts! The Best."

We lived in Laramie for a few years and come back frequently to visit friends. For this trip we booked Tami's place and we were not disappointed. Everything was as described and better. There was popcorn and cookies, plus muffins and fruit for us in the kitchen. Tami and Dick invited our kids to play in the playhouse they built for their grandkids and even had a trunk of toys for them to play with. Hank, their sweet dog, was enjoyable and my boys loved him. They offered to let us store our bikes in their garage. We will be back to stay with Tami and Dick. This is a top notch place in Laramie and one of the best we have stayed in across the country."

Very quaint space that was decorated for Christmas making it feel more like staying with family than somewhere strange! The place was so clean…even the baseboards in bathroom!!! Tammy was super friendly and accommodating, especially after we got stuck in Laramie because of Wyoming weather. We loved the fresh muffins and fruit that was left for us. Stop looking, book this place, you won’t regret it!"

Even though we didn’t cook ourselves the kitchen had so much to offer… a nice selection of spices, flour, sugar, oatmeal, peanut butter, an assortment of fresh fruit and delicious homemade muffins. The decor is fun throughout the entire place. So many unexpected items are provided such as cell phone chargers for both an I-phone and an android phone plus other items not typically provided at an Airbnb. This place is a real gem of a find!"

All the listings were just as described. I highly recommend any of her properties and I will continue to book them until I get a permanent residence while working in Laramie!"

The space is very aesthetically pleasing - clean, not cluttered and I really loved the little gas fireplace, it made everything seem extra cozy. It's just a quick walk to downtown or to campus. I appreciated a rectangular table as I brought drawing supplies with me. I would definitely stay again! Thank you!!"

Stayed a few nights","I loved the studio. I miscalculated my driving Eta, and checked in a day later than anticipated. As a result. I had to extend my stay a day, and incur the additional cost. None the less, the comfy bed, linens and peace and quiet made it all worthwhile. I arrived in the wee hours, and could not see the house address number so that took me afew times around the block.I made every effort to follow the instructions, but misunderstood the street parking diagram , and the arrows on the street signs regarding permit parking made no sense to me at all. I got a $50 parking ticket. Ive got some mobility issues and have handicap plates . The walk from the street to the studio is dark so keep your cell flashlight with you. I took pics of the street signs and the free parking diagram to city hall to dispute. They were kind and accommodating. I was told to submit the pics online and request the $50 ticket be waved. Again, I loved the studio. I loved the neighborhood."

Stayed one night","We stayed here to cap off a 9 day camping trip in the Tetons before continuing onto Denver to fly home. This was a literal haven for us. It was the cleanest, most convenient, and far and away nicest Airbnb I have ever stayed in and I have stayed in a few now. It is not just because we slept in a tent for 8 nights, this is a seriously great place to hang your hat. We stayed in Laramie 9 days prior on our way up to the Tetons and made the mistake of booking a hotel and not this. Luckily it was available last minute for our return to the Denver area. Laramie is a great little town, and this Airbnb won’t be beat it’s within walking distance to the downtown area and has ample street parking. I actually sleep better at night knowing this Airbnb exists and it is managed by people who take such great care. I never really write reviews, for anything and I mean every word of this one, if you see this listing available for your dates, you are lucky and truly in for a great experience."

The studio is charming and modern, nicer than a hotel suite (plus has a full kitchen), and a perfect location for walking to campus or the downtown area. I felt lucky I found it, and it was available during my dates."

Stayed a few nights","Really cute space and comfy bed within walking distance to downtown Laramie. Looks exactly like the photos, check in instructions were smooth - and like others' reviewed, I had no issues finding free parking on the street just outside the building.
Unfortunately the electricity was out in the space (and most of the town) for half of my stay. Krista was communicative about the issue, and it was obviously out of her control - but it nonetheless made being able to actually use the space infeasible.
In a hotel or similar situation I'd expect to be credited some amount back, with Airbnb I guess this is a risk you run."

Location is perfect, design is incredibly charming, spacious, and equipped with more than anything you might need. If it was for sale, I would buy it. The bed is comfy, the shower and sinks work well, and it's plenty toasty on a subzero night.
I absolutely LOVED it and will be renting it again!"

Stayed one night","I was traveling across the country & ended up passing through Laramie. Looking for a hotel, decided at the last minute (like 8pm) to check Airbnb and found this amazing place at a very comparable price to the freeway hotels. Krista responded right away and I booked one night. The place was really nice, clean, modern, and cool. It was chilly when I arrived, and it takes a little while to heat up with electric heaters on the walls and a nice little gas fireplace in the corner, but it eventually got comfortable. Bed is very firm memory foam. Not my favorite kind of bed, but it was better than most hotel beds. It was VERY quiet overnight and in the morning. Great location very near the cute old downtown shopping, restaurants, etc. Don't know if I'll ever be in Laramie again, but 100% would rent this place again. It's one of, if not THE best Airbnb I've stayed in so far!"
