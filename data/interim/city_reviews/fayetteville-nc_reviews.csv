Group trip","Bella was a fantastic host! The house was immaculate and beautifully decorated. We loved all the extra special touches that made it feel like a real get away. From the massage chair, to the showers, and the game room, Bella's place was not just a great place to stay, but a wonderful setting to relax. Highly recommend!!!Thank you!"

Group trip","Fayetteville, is a military town with limited attractions. This home was a home away from home. A central location with everything within a 5 minute driving distance. We were there to celebrate a graduation and Mother’s Day and loved the home. The place is even nicer in person than in pictures. Host literally thinks of the small details one can forget on a trip and has them there. The towels are white, I mean white like you would expect at a 5 star hotel. I recommend to anyone that appreciates a comfortable place like there home and will care for it as there own because the house is very nice and beds are comfortable."

Group trip","This was a perfect AirBnB for our family of 5 to visit my father, who lives nearby. The teens enjoyed having private rooms (that locked!) and it was cool to re-experience Galaga from my childhood. Rooms were clean, instructions clear, and so quiet at night. Great driving distance to historic Fayetteville. We loved Circa 1800 - great food (banana pudding, boudin balls, and craft cocktails) and cozy back room."

Stayed with kids","Bella,
We can't thank you enough for sharing your lovely home with us! It was beautifully decorated, perfectly clean, and very comfortable! Having two living spaces was great for our family, and the game room was a big hit with our grandson! The three bathrooms were very nicely redone! The couch in the family room was super comfy! (I'd love to know where you got it!!) It was just so welcoming and homey, our grandchildren didn't want to leave!
If we ever have a need to return to Fayetteville, we would love to stay in your home again!"

Group trip","Bella’s place was nothing short of amazing! I originally booked her home for my aunts who are older (60’s plus) after a long drive from FL. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by a warm open concept. The updated touches (master shower), kitchen amenities, and convenient bathroom in the back bedroom) we’re just AWESOME. I would honestly book this place again just for me. I also recommend anyone else to book and stay here.
Lastly, Bella was SO flexible with communication and reservation. I had to add an additional day to the stay last minute, which she approved promptly and when we checked out my aunt left her cell phone in the home after the door codes had changed. Bella gave us a new code to access the door and my aunt was able to get her belongings. The cleaners were present so I was originally weary, because I have had bad experiences with cleaners stealing guests items. This was NOT the case! Thank you to Bella ! this was the perfect accommodation for my family. 10/10 ."

Group trip","Our son was getting married in the Vicinity. We initially picked Bella’s Place because of the three bathrooms and four bedrooms. We did not see any other Airbnb’s with 3 bathrooms. Once we walked into Bella’s place, we were truly excited with the space and the layout of the home. Being there added so much to the wedding weekend. Bella had everything well stocked and there were really no issues I needed to contact her about. Definitely recommend!"

We had family over to bbq for the holiday and it was spacious enough for all of us and room for kids to play. The home itself was beautiful, everyone raved about the comfort of having personal door codes and so much space to relax. There was a bad storm while we were there and Bella was very responsive about reconnecting the internet and any needs we had. Definitely adding this to our list for the next time we’re in town! Thanks so much for everything!"

Stayed with kids","Bella’s place was exactly as the photos portrayed it to be and then some. This only the second time staying at an Airbnb and was a little nervous because it looked so nice compared to others I was reviewing for our stay. She was very helpful and sent someone right over when we had issues with the code for the door. She allowed us to have family over for a celebration meal. There are no pictures of the backyard in her listing so I do want to mention it was very accommodating for my family and guests. There is a basketball hoop, volleyball, picnic table, large patio table and grill. Having 3 bathrooms was very convenient. There were essentials there to get us through a few days so we didn’t have to run right out to the store. The home is updated, very clean and comfortable. The furniture was new and comfy along with the beds. Thank you Bella for opening up this home for us to have some much needed family time."

Carli is so responsive and proactive...example...the day before I checked out, I let her know that some supplies were low. Now remember I was only staying one more evening. I sent her this text during the afternoon and when I got back to the cabin the supplies were sitting on the porch! Amazing"

Stayed a few nights","A must to visit!…Carli’s Cozy place… Pristine, charming, peaceful, private, and packed full of every amenity you could possibly think of. I loved, loved everything about this place. It was personable and private.The off street parking was a bit of a challenge, but was totally manageable. Carli, the host, made me feel right at home. She truly is a good person and has a real heart of hospitality. It is clear to me that she loves inviting people to experience her beautiful oasis. Her place is second to none!!! She has taken time to cross every “t” and dot every “i”. When traveling, it’s easy to forget to pack something or have a last minute need. Well, at this place…if you can think of it, it is there. From the clear precise instructions to the fully loaded kitchen cabinets. Thank you Carli for sharing your place and your heart. I would definitely re-visit and will definitely remember experiencing this visit to Carli’s Cozy Place."

The place is so tastefully decorated, so warm and cozy, that we felt right at home from the moment we opened the door. The cottage is private and spacious, perfect for a couple. I really wished I could have packed it in my luggage so we could live in it when we retire!
Carli is an awesome hostess, very kind, caring, thoughtful, and communicative. You can see how much she cares about her cottage and her clients by how clean the place is and all the added extras that people may forget to bring from home.
We enjoyed our stay immensely, and we'll definitely be booking again the next time we visit NC!"

Beautifully decorated, plenty of dishes, kitchen supplies, toiletries, extra blankets and pillows, washer and dryer with supplies, Roku. This place has everything you need. Carli goes above and beyond with communication answering texts immediately and thoroughly. She is polite and professional and has many personal suggestions to offer. I reached out several times over my stay and she was happy to answer each time. If needing a comfortable place when visiting Fayetteville, book here. You won't regret it."

Stayed a few nights","Carli provided a home away from home when I visited Fayetteville for house hunting. She is an AMAZING host. Everything and I do mean everything that I could have asked for was there. As I was arriving on a late night flight, she provided muffins for my breakfast next morning in addition to the breakfast items that she already had there. Her cottage was beyond clean and well appointed. This was my first trip since the pandemic started and I was not concerned once I stepped foot in this little paradise in the woods. It was a peaceful place to rest and recharge after a busy day of house hunting. Carli is so quick to respond to questions before my visit and during though I had only a few and that was because I did not understand how to work the TVs and she came so quickly just to make sure I knew how it worked since I knew nothing except what I was accustomed to and that was cable. I would 100% recommend Carli as your host should you visit Fayetteville, North Carolina. I am so pleased that I chose her cozy, roomy cottage. If I could give her a 10 star rating, I would!"

Stayed a few nights","My recent stay at ""The Cottage"" in Fayetteville, North Carolina, hosted by the incredible Connie, was an absolute delight—the Airbnb seamlessly blended style and comfort, from its spotless interiors to the thoughtful decor. Our super host, Connie, contributed to the exceptional experience with a warm welcome and detailed instructions that made every aspect of the stay easy.
""The Cottage"" is a true haven of relaxation, featuring a well-appointed kitchen and cozy living spaces, including a comfortable and tranquil outdoor area. Connie's meticulous attention to detail is evident throughout, creating an elegant and inviting atmosphere.
The location couldn't be more ideal, offering convenient access to Fayetteville's attractions and amenities. During my visit to family in the area, the home served as the perfect base for exploring the city or enjoying the peacefulness of the neighborhood. I felt perfectly situated for a thoroughly enjoyable stay."

Stayed a few nights","Connie’s cottage was indeed a home away from home. It was immaculate and had everything that you would need and more! It was so cozy especially the nice bed linens, blankets and pillows. I can honestly say that the comfort of the bedding gave me the best sleep ever(especially since I’m an insomniac). 😊. I had to cook a Thanksgiving meal and had everything that I needed with the cookware. I appreciated the fact that she had a great breakfast readily available. This is definitely my go to place when I’m in Fayetteville. I tip my 🎩 to Connie for being the best host ever!!"

Connie was an amazing host! From the moment we stepped onto the deck we knew it would be perfect for us.
Everything we needed was there. She left enough breakfast to get us through our stay, I’ve never had any host leave breakfast! It was a very thoughtful addition.
The beds were comfy and I didn’t want to get up! The deck was our favorite. It was like a sanctuary, waterfall, rain, peaceful. We definitely plan to book again very soon. ❤️"

THAT says A LOT! In having the intent to make an annual trip to visit a wonderful cat rescue in St. Pauls that I sponsor, I will continue to work the timing of my travel dates to align with when the cottage is available. Free guaranteed parking, easy access with keypad, overall very clean and uncluttered (even outside on the covered porch that I LOVE!), comfortable beds, safe area, close to retail/restaurants/highway, stocked with some food/beverage for breakfast and I used washer/dryer. Recommend using coffee filters instead of the filter basket. Connie is quick to respond."

Unfortunately this May is uncommonly cold and windy so we didn’t sit out much. She also provides enough breakfast food and coffee to last a couple of days. These are definitely our go to lodgings when in town."

Connie is a super friendly and accommodating host. She responded right away to my questions and was attentive to our needs.
The photos don’t do the cottage justice because it’s far more cute, homey, well decorated and stylish than the photos reveal.
The private porch is so cozy and, at night, even magical and serene with its dim lighting and waterfall for ambiance. My favorite space for sure!
The kitchen is fully stocked for cooking in, and updated with the cutest modern amenities. My favorite room in the house!
The bathroom has THE BEST walk in tile shower big enough for two people. My favorite feature for sure!
Another great detail is the central location to restaurants and shopping. Five minutes to anything you need."

The beds are comfortable, the couch pleasant to read on, as well as a nice assortment of other furniture and decorations. A look thru the kitchen showed a good assortment of pans, dishes and modern appliances; although I did not make any meals.
Connie was very quick to respond to any communication or questions leading up to the stay. I never had any issues once in the house but I can safely assume she would have just as quickly responded to and fixed any issues found.
The house came with some breakfast items and cold bottled water in the fridge.
The neighborhood was quiet and we had no disturbance during the stay. There was off-street parking just behind the house with my car visible out of the bedroom window.
If I or any of my friends need a place in Fayetteville I will look to see if Connie has anything available."

Everything was “EASY” at the cottage….keypad/lock worked well, entire home and porch were VERY clean, it is sufficiently stocked, quick response from Connie when I asked if she had a few baggies I could use (she provided me with a whole new box), retail/restaurants/highway are very close by (while the neighborhood is QUIET), parking area is guaranteed on the back side of the cottage, Air Conditioning and ceiling fans available, plenty of pillows (I think they all are foam, I bring my feather pillow when I travel as it’s what works better for me :-), the beds are comfortable…..so it may come as no surprise that I will DEFINITELY put this cottage at the top of my list to check, and cross my fingers, for availability whenever I come to the Fayetteville area!
Connie’s rules are totally reasonable and I did my part to leave the cottage as close as I could to when I arrived so she can keep the cleaning fee low for guests. Thanks much, Connie!"

Enjoying a breakfast sandwich with coffee on the well shaded deck was my morning routine. The breakfast amenities were VERY appreciated. Quiet neighborhood, close to groceries, restaurants and access to major roads. The “Cottage” is now my go to place for visits to Fayetteville, NC. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

The moment you ascend a few steps, you can hear a fountain and see a warm, tranquil setting on the deck. Upon entering the home, the wonderful aroma of fresh cleaning lingers in the air. Connie, the host has gone beyond caring for her guest. She had coffee, breakfast even juice and milk for us along with goodies. The cottage is decorated in the cutest way and furniture is comfortable!! The shower has great water pressure and hot!! The bedrooms are beyond comfy topped with a plush memory foam and high end linens!! We are so grateful Connie was able to accommodate us on short notice!! The cottage is definitely a gem!!

Stayed a few nights","Nobody likes third party booking, and I'm pretty sure Airbnb doesn't like it either since it makes communication and accurate reviews difficult if not altogether impossible. However, with upfront honesty and a promise to maintain excellent communication throughout Connie took a chance with us, and we're certainly thankful she did. We flew one of our authors in from out of town in order to participate in a lecture and book signing event. Being from the area, we know where the best places in town are to stay, and that's why we selected the Cottage. This place is an absolute gem and our guest author was amazed by the accommodations we were able to provide thanks to Connie. The guest's flight was a disaster and by the time he arrived he was tired and hungry and in no mood to venture back out for food. Connie had provided a well stocked fridge full of goodies and coffee for the morning. Wow! A really nice touch one doesn't usually find in other Airbnbs. The place is immaculately decorated and extremely clean. The outside covered porch is an oasis of its own and very relaxing. The beds are super comfortable and the place is just the right size; not too big and certainly not cramped. But best of all, Connie provides value at a time when a lot of folks need it. The Cottage is comparable to other Airbnbs costing much more with less experienced hosts. If you're lucky enough to find some space on Connie's calendar, you won't be disappointed."

Throughout our stay she never hesitated to make us feel comfortable. The cozy aesthetic throughout made us feel like we were at home, and the covered porch was the perfect spot for a morning coffee. We will definitely book it again when we’re back in the area next."

I needed a place pretty quick and booked with Connie. It had absolutely everything one would need. There were even extra toiletries which came in handy since I came into town on emergency and needed a toothbrush and tooth paste. The kitchen was stocked with all things needed and several snacks and goodies to get started. I really wish I had more time to enjoy the beautiful deck. It was so warm and inviting with a beautiful fountain feature. This house would be a must for anyone needing comfort and location. Best wishes for this BnB! ❤

Stayed a few nights",The Cottage is one of the best places we have stayed through Airbnb! Connie is a great host who has beautifully decorated a small house in a quiet neighborhood in Fayetteville! She stocks the kitchen better than anyone else by far! We were looking something close to the hospital(wife works there)because of the snow storm headed our way and my wife didn’t want to have to drive very far in the snowy and icy conditions. This place was perfect! She also has the Bungalow across the street in case the Cottage is not open. We have stayed there also and it’s great too! You will not be disappointed with a stay here!

Due to being near an army base we did hear the ranges going off all night but only from the front room, and nothing that wasn’t fixed by some white noise. We setup our little girl in one of the back rooms and she slept super well. The beds are really cozy and the shower nice and hot. You really can’t beat this place for the great price.

The house had a perfect blend of cozy and chic decor, creating a comfortable atmosphere throughout. All the rooms were spacious and provided ample comfort. The added bonus of a large yard for kids to play and a garage with weights for working out made our stay even more enjoyable. The washer and dryer in the garage were a huge bonus for fluffing clothes after travel. The check in and check out processes were so simple and easy to complete with 4 kids. Great family location.

It is obvious he takes pride in his property, respects his neighbors and truly cares about his guests. This will be our go- to accommodations in the future. 😊"

The neighborhood is nice and close to EVERYTHING you may need to want to do in Fayetteville or surrounding areas. Matt and Liz are amazing hosts and very responsive and accommodating. There was nothing that we needed, but they did a great job of making sure that the home was equipped with anything that we may have needed. Will definitely stay here on my next trip to Fayetteville if it'savailable."

The neighborhood was nice and quite and tucked away, but still close to restaurants and stores if you needed to grab something. The beds where amazingly comfortable and my husband and I both agreed that we had a great nights sleep.
Matt’s communication with us throughout the stay was prompt and he was very friendly. He even accommodated my last minute request, and was more then understanding when we had to be accommodated with a late checkout because of my oversight thinking that I had reserved the accommodations for an extra day. I would absolutely Love to stay here again, and if not available I will look for other properties in the area hosted by Matt. For the price, comfort, and experience with the host, If you are thinking about staying here, do it! You will be so glad you did!"

Matt was very easy to communicate with and quick to get back to us on the few questions we had. Note that the location is about 20 minutes off 95, but in my opinion, worth it for the comfort, price, and quiet. Hope to say again on another one of our drives."

Location was super convenient for access to the highway, but far enough to not hear road noise. Be advised that there is a bright street light that shines through a beautiful arched window in the primary bedroom. The lower window has blinds and curtains, but there is still a significant amount of light through the upper window. My wife and I use sleeping masks regularly and this light did not pose a problem. Anyone with sensitivity to perfumed detergents, be advised that just the primary bed sheets and/or comforter had a clean but distinct scent which was a minor annoyance to us, but could be a problem for some. Overall, excellent!"

Kelly answered faster than I would have expected and was even flexible at the last minute for something that was a time management fault of my own.

However, the surrounding houses are not well-maintained ! …you have to be very aware of shared property behind this property where the lighted wooden bridge leads that leads to Cape fear River, because roaming dogs do come on to the property. One in particular was a very large dog who had done its business in several places on the rental property, Ashley was very gracious about understanding that ; we wish we could have cleaned it up, but there was no utensils to clean ALL that up. Inside of the house is very very clean."

Host was very prepared for our family and had everything we needed to be comfortable. Special thanks for the pastries you left for us! Hope to see you next time we are home visiting.

Lots of natural light due to large windows that face a nature lovers backyard. Plenty of natural shade from trees. We saw variety of birds including a woodpecker and a deer across the river. Enjoyed grilling and making smores outdoors. Many thoughtful and practical details in the home to ensure a comfortable and fun stay for the whole family including dog. First-rate communication and responsiveness- Ashley is a pro. Got great tips from the welcome binder on places to eat and things to do (it even includes local medical facilities if need arises). Thank you for great family time- our 10 and 14 year old daughters loved it too!"

The living room is set up nicely a good TV and sound system. I'll be checking this listing first anytime I'm traveling in the area."

Stayed with a pet","We had house work being done so this was the perfect place to do a quick stay while that was happening. Host was responsive and accommodating to an early check in based on our schedule. Great backyard for the dog. The kitchen wasn’t as well stocked as the listing made it seem -no basics like cooking oil, almost no foil, no extra paper towels, and very limited pots and pans. Wasn’t a huge deal since we could grab stuff from our house but a bit inconvenient to do so. Also could be a little cleaner especially bathrooms but it wasn’t too bad. If your pets are escape artist you do have to be careful of some loose fence post but the backyard was amazing and for most pets no issues…ours is just a determine dog.
Overall I would recommend! Super appreciative of the flexibility and responsiveness."

Stayed with a pet","Nicolas was very communicative, no problem there. However, the house was not clean like I would have liked it. Mind u, im not one to complain but it was a mess. We walked in the house and u couldnt even smell any type of cleaning products, i do mean nothing! The mirror in the bedroom is caked up with dust like it hasn't been cleaned in months! There is so much trash and rose petals under the beds. The couch had trash in the cushions. The fridge was NOT cleaned out. Had somebody's leftovers and stuff in it. The laundry detergent container was absolutely empty, thank goodness I brought some laundry pods of my own. Every other dish and cup I pulled out the cabinet had to be washed as it was noticeably dirty. The mattresses do not have a mattress casing or anything so the mattresses are pretty disgusting. We ended up sleeping on the couch. Pool table was great, the sticks don't have hardly any tips left so can't really use the chalk so that part sucked. The dogs did love the big yard!"

Would be perfect for hosting except the rules would not allow “partying.” 🤷🏼‍♀️ Host is slow to respond, which can be difficult at times, especially on checking in and trying to get electronics to work, needing sufficient towels and not bringing, and numerous areas lacking cleaning, most noticeably the kitchen with sticky spots on floor and dishes in washer still dirty. No paper towels, dirty rags in washing machine, only one dishwasher pod left. Enjoyed stay overall, would not rebook if in area again."

Stayed a few nights","I can say this place is in a very peaceful neighborhood and everything was somewhat stocked. Place definitely needs a good cleaning. We had to leave after one day of staying because the carpets and rooms smelled like pets and our socks picked up a lot of pet hair. Grass was too tall, a landscaper stopped us on our way out and asked us did we need their services, so that said a lot. Also we booked this house because my husband and I are pool players. So disappointed the table was broke and uneven. We didn’t get to enjoy the pool table or the house."

The only unfortunate situation was that we couldn't use the pool as the previous guest kept the cover off their whole stay which let a lot of debris go into it to where we couldn't use it. It wasn't the end of the world though we still enjoyed ourselves!

The pool table was too close to the wall to use (maybe we could have moved it over, or used it anyway but we didn't want to risk damaging the wall). Also, the lights in the hallway and living room didn't seem to work, making the sunken living room almost dangerous at night. Otherwise, the location was great and the space was nice."

We loved the nature surrounding the house. Lots of trees, a quiet street, and so much greenery. Waking up in the morning to birds chirping on the lawn and squirrels playing just outside the windows. We were able to cook meals as the kitchen has pots, pans, nice plates, bowls, and silverware. We hosted a small dinner to celebrate my daughter's birthday and having the pool table and board games were a hit! The host was very responsive to the few questions I had during the trip. Anyone visiting their child at Ft. Bragg should consider their stay here."

Stayed with a pet",Nicolas was very responsive with questions and concerns. The home was good enough for a one night. The home was clean however there was a distinct smell. We couldn’t tell it someone was trying to cover having a really good time or animal urine. Also it was bare in essentials that could make a longer stay more difficult.

Stayed with a pet","Needed a place to stop for a night on the way to Charleston with the pups and the house was perfect. Easy access to the highway but in a quiet neighborhood - important to note that I felt very safe here :) There’s a couple of small restaurants within walking distance around the corner and it’s also about a 4-mile drive up the road to a ton of restaurants/shopping. The house is immaculately clean and the yard was HUGE with a secure fence - the pups really enjoyed exploring. The outside space was perfect to unwind after 9 hours in the car from PA. Exactly what I needed without breaking the bank - would absolutely stay here again. Thanks for sharing your home, Nick!"

My son and I were very comfortable in the house. It is very clean very spacious and very entertaining. He enjoyed playing pool but more than that hooking up his music to the surround sound Bluetooth. It was an excellent visit and we hope to stay there again.

Two things to note: we could find only two wash cloths and two towels in the house. You may want to bring extra linens. Also, the living room is sunken with steps leading into and out of the space. We were fine with it but it wouldn’t be ideal for anyone with stability/mobility issues."

We were very happy with our overnight stay with the exception that I just did not find the full-size, pull-out bed to be comfortable. :( (Note: My partner said he was comfortable, but I felt like I was sleeping on a rock.) Most reviewers don’t mention the bed - noting for those who need more comfort. Hope an improvement is made on the mattress/bed. Would love to stay again. Everything else is 10/10!"

I may have made a mistake when I booked that there were 2 beds.

A bottle of water was waiting in the fridge for me, which was very much needed after a long day of traveling. Cookies and hot cocoa mix in the kitchen as well. And on the return trip, there was even a small bag of dog treats for my four legged companion. I couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay and will absolutely try to book here if I’m coming through again this year."

I chose to try Fox's Pizza and would recommend (closest to Reta's). Not alot of food options nearby so be prepared if you want to go out for a meal you will need to drive closer to Fayetteville.

There was a huge dog at the end of the one path that scared the begezies out of me. He was loose and huge, he didn’t come up to us but we scurried away from him. Honestly don’t know if the dog belonged to the host. The property and the tiny house are truly unique. Unfortunately we arrived later than we would have liked and only spent one night but we were able to get a nice mile walk in. I would recommend the place for sure and would love to visit again."

The directions Reta provided were very clear to get to the Airbnb. Great sign right down the driveway to guide you to where to park and lead right up to the front door.
The Airbnb was more than what we expected and we were beyond pleased with the pull out couch (super comfy) and amenities of the place. Super quiet and peaceful night. Only regret is we wish we had more time to walk around and explore the beautiful scenery and enjoy the seating around the fire area that’s right outside the tiny home. This stay really helped us get thru the rest of our trip the following day.
Would absolutely stay here again ◡̈"

Stayed with a pet","Reta's place was incredible! It is in a beautiful setting, right out of a movie. Reta's family owns a tree farm and the walking paths surrounding it are amazing! However, the sleeping arrangements do need to be discussed. I was lucky as there was only me and my dog (with her pillow). I am not sure how two people or folks with limited mobility would have been able to sleep on the ""chair beds"". Yes, the pictures on the posting make it look easy to change the chairs into beds. There is also a set of directions on a sheet of household informational tidbits like wifi, etc.. However, I was unsuccessful and used one of the mattresses I found. After driving all day and two Tylenol PM, I was ready to sleep anywhere. I am not sharing this info to keep anyone from staying here. I just think a more realistic description of the sleeping arrangements needs to be shared."

A pull out sofa would seem like a better option, but even still they do have options to choose from (the chairs pull out to single beds, another little fold out cushion for the floor, and an air mattress). Otherwise, there’s nothing negative I can say because it’s a beautiful home in a peaceful location off the main highway. The hosts were very responsive to messages which I appreciated! Thank you so much! I will be back!"

Stayed one night","Our group of three had to cancel our booking at another location and needed to find a place to stay at the last minute. By luck this tiny house had just been listed and even though it had no reviews (at the time) we contacted the host to see if it would be right for our needs and after a quick exchange we went ahead and booked it for two different stays. We were a bit nervous at the idea of being one of the first guests to stay at this location, but we had absolutely nothing to worry about. The property is just a few short minutes off I-95 surrounded by trees and away from all the noise. A code is needed to check in which our hosts sent to us before we arrived and we were able to park directly next to the house itself. A note was waiting for us with a contact number that we actually had to use because we couldn't figure out how to work the tv (which is set up with Roku and Netflix). Not only were the hosts more than happy to help resolve the issue but they wasted no time to get it fixed; when we walked through the door on our second stay the tv was set up and ready to go! There are three sleeper chairs with linens, but an air mattress is offered as a substitute for one of the chairs and a queen sized bed in a separate area can also be used at no extra charge which really goes to show how much the hosts care about the comfort of their guests. There's a kitchenette sink, mini fridge, and stove combo as well as a small microwave and two coffee machines (k-cup and standard). The kitchen provides cups, cutlery, plates, a few cooking utensils, and a convertible table that seats two. The bathroom is roomy, has plenty of towels, and the walk-in shower has consistent hot water with good pressure. What we really appreciated were the small touches such as the snacks/candy on the kitchen table, the waters and sodas stocked in the fridge, the board game in the main area, and the fire wood for the outside pit; on our second stay there were sugars and creamers available as well as body wash and shampoo/conditioner in addition to everything else. However, nothing will highlight how kind and generous these hosts are more than the message we got from them between our stays asking after our well being as they knew we were in Florida at the time Nicole was passing through the state. It was an absolute joy to stay at the tiny house with these hosts and we highly recommend others to stay here whether it's for one night or an extended stay."

I did a bike ride Saturday and then picked her up Saturday night, it was an easy drive to there and we slept so well on the beds, the mattress was so comfortable. Reta left everything in the house that we could possibly need. Her and her husband also had the outside fire pit loaded with wood ready for us to use. It was a wonderful stay, and we look forward to coming back."

Group trip","If I could place a title on this review it would be called Laughing Out Loud. My family and I always have so much fun and we laugh a lot...loudly. One moment while laughing, I quieted myself and thought I may be too loud (as if in a hotel and possibly disturbing the other guests). Then I realized that I was at ""home.""
I can't say enough about the hospitality we received during our stay. From the beginning to end, our hosts were very responsive. They went above and beyond to ensure that we had a pleasant stay.
The little amenities in this home made the biggest difference. Suitcase racks, the good felt hangers, laundry baskets, mints, tissues, water, coffee...and towels, towels, and more towels. We were well taken care of!
This house gave my family a chance to be together for my mom's 70th birthday. Beyond all the little touches, the greatest touch was that it was filled with love and peace. We would definitely stay again! Thank you Rodney and Seante'!"

It's sooooooooooooo many amazing amenities stocked & provided in the home & the location is literally bike riding distance from the mall, grocery stores, movie theater, & even from Fort Bragg. Sorry people, there's nothing negative that I can say about my stay @ this astonishing guesthouse.

Very neat and clean. Beds/pillows were very comfortable. Great quiet location! We could get to shopping, restaurants, mall and grocery stores within minutes. Check-in was easy and hosts were very clear on instructions. They checked in with us daily. This was my first time booking an AirBNB and Seante & Rodney made it a wonderful experience. We drove from several states away and appreciated the flexibility with check-in. It rained the entire stay and we were not able to use the back yard but it looked very inviting with the grill/patio and has a very nice wooden privacy fence."

Stayed with kids","Rodney and Seante’s place was perfect for me and my boys. The fenced in backyard was perfect for them to run around and play. It was also a relaxing space for me to get some quiet time. The inside was extremely clean and organized. I thought they had to be former military because no one folds towels that perfectly.😂 But seriously, the Guest House felt like a home away from home. It had all of the basic necessities and was cozy, yet spacious enough for us to enjoy each other. The house is also in a great location, you’re no more than 2 or 3 miles from everything you will need. I am definitely booking in advance for my future trips to N.C. I already tried booking for next week, but it’s already taken😩. They were great hosts. You can’t go wrong with this property or these hosts."

We initially came to visit family which unexpectedly turned into making funeral arrangements as a family member passed. Seante allowed us to extend our reservation and add family as events unfolded and expressed their sympathy for our loss.
The house was very clean, beyond well stocked, comfortable, and very close to numerous places in Fayetteville. One of our family members said that they had the softest towels in the world here. This place is one we will reserve again for future trips to Fayetteville. Thank you again Rodney and Seante for the beautiful home and adding a human touch in a difficult time in our lives."

The house was very clean, appliances worked well, white sheets and towels that look brand new. The house was well stocked, we only had to purchase food.
The backyard was a nice surprise; very spacious with a BBQ grill and places to sit and enjoy. Easy access to the backyard.

Group trip","I don’t even know where to begin!
We booked this stay for 6 people (3 couples) 2 of us were celebrating our 22nd birthday on New Year’s Day, and we were spending this weekend with the people we loved. Rodney and Seante’s house was PERFECT for this. When we arrived Seante greeted us to give us a personal tour of the home. She made sure we knew where everything was located, and what to expect of our stay. They graciously provided tips about local restaurants and activities in a binder in the living room, left Shampoo Conditioner, body wash, makeup wipes, razors and a travel toothbrush in both bathrooms in case you forgot your own. I think I speak for the 3 women in our household that we loved that they left makeup wipes and even had darker wash cloths to wash our face with so we didn’t have to worry about messing up their white towels. Everything was amazing, I could go on and on about the small details, but instead I’ll give you the big picture. If you are looking for somewhere charming and affordable this is your place! We were less than 5 minutes from town.
I will say that they were very responsive to anything we may have needed from them and all in all they made us feel so very welcome. If I find myself in Fayetteville again I know EXACTLY where I’ll be staying.
Thank you Rodney and Seante for such a wonderful stay!!"

Stayed a few nights","As soon as we arrived we noticed a gorgeous view of the trees from the back patio. Inside, the home looked freshly re-modeled. Whoever designed the interior should be very proud. The whole home was gorgeous. We were very happy and will absolutely return."

Stayed with kids","We were so fortunate to have been able to find this gem! This home was immaculately clean and the layout/furniture/bedding was great! Our host was on point, and was able to quickly supply us with a few extra needed items without us even requesting! It was also conveniently close to the city of Fayetteville! This was a much needed peaceful, quiet and comfortable home that truly sets the bar above and beyond."

Group trip","We stayed at Katie's house for my sister's baby shower weekend and it was absolutely perfect. Each bedroom had it's own bathroom with an additional half bath, the kitchen was very spacious and invited people in to sit around the bar and talk, the sun room was where my mom woke up and read every morning and the cleanliness of the home was beautiful. She had coffee ready to go, clean sheets and towels and it truly felt perfect for me and my four sisters."

Group trip","We were in the area for a wedding. This was a perfect location for our needs as we were less than 2 miles from the wedding venue.
The property was as just as described, very clean, and spacious. Each bedroom provided privacy and a comfortable mattress/linens.
We very much enjoyed our stay and would absolutely recommend."

Stayed with kids","We fell in love with the Blake Cottage and I will be back! My family lives nearby, so I'm probably a little biased, but we loved this place! It is stocked with a full setup for multiple guests in rooms that also rent separately. Plenty of parking and porch seating, and there's a friendly neighborhood floppy eared bunny that visits occasionally 🐇 😂
Seriously though this place is great. It is super clean, modern, with fast internet, and the air conditioning works really well. Right near 95 if you're looking for a quick stop on the way!
I'll be back!"
