Group trip","The Farmhouse on Ollie is a lovely home. It is fresh, clean, no clutter, nicely decorated and furnished. The kitchen is perfectly stocked with anything you could possibly need, the towels/bed linens are of good quality. The photos are true to the quality, comfort and design of the house.
We were visiting Stephenville to celebrate my brother and sister-in-law's 50th wedding anniversary. This was a great house for us and our grown children to stay for the weekend. Thank you, Maddie!"

Group trip","When we arrived it was even better than I could have imagined! We arrived in December for a Tarleton State graduation. The house was perfectly and tastefully decorated with Christmas decor that did not clutter but added a perfect holiday touch. We were also greeted with several snacks available which were appreciated! The pantry even had some basics like flour and sugar and even some Mac and cheese. This was a pleasant surprise. We had 6 people staying in the house and had a small approved gathering to celebrate the graduation. It was perfect! A true diamond covering all 4 C’s! Comfortable, convenient, clean, and super cute!
We also had a bit of a challenge in that the day of graduation was raining and the school moved graduation to Saturday instead of Friday. We had planned to leave on Saturday. Checkout was at 11 but graduation was not until 3:00. Maddie was awesome and worked with us to extend our time in the house. Top Notch Host!!"

Stayed a few nights","You must stay in this airbnb if you're in the area! It's a carefully appointed historical landmark. It's obvious that a great deal of time and thought went into the furniture and decor, right down to the colorful potted plants out front. The beds are luxurious and the shower is first rate. I wish we could have spent more time on the front porch soaking up the calm. It's very close to the square and not far from the college. Check in was smooth. The host was very helpful and engaging. Absolutely delightful place! We'll be back."

Stayed with kids","An absolute gem of a place, we highly recommend staying here. Nearby amenities, quiet neighborhood, beautiful home. Dally was responsive and helpful. Our family thoroughly enjoyed our stay, our girls didn’t want to leave. We stayed here and drove into Glen Rose for the eclipse, and it was well worth the scenic drive! The decor was top notch, the beds were extremely comfortable and plush, there’s a tv in every room, extremely clean bathrooms, and that kitchen! Stunning. And the view of that wide open sky in the backyard is simply amazing. It’s especially perfect for a quiet couple’s getaway.
One thing I would like to point out is that there is a lot of glass around the home (showers, large floor mirrors, furnishings, and dish ware) so be mindful if you have littles.
Overall, 5/5! We hope to stay there again."

Denise did a fabulous job of adding extra amenities such as shampoo, conditioner and body wash in the showers, a few snacks and bottled water and a jar of candy! This house was super convenient to the university, shopping, food, etc. The only drawback (minor) was that this house is located in an older part of town that needs some TLC. Some homes were in dire need of repair or demolition, yet many of them were being renovated, and it was evident there was a movement to improve the area overall. My daughter and I felt safe and would recommend staying there again!"

The only restaurants we ate at were what she suggested in the binder. They were great. The only time I contacted Dennise was to let her know we left and loved it. It was that nice and smooth! 100% stay here again.

There were 2 different types of coffee makers with all the coffee (many varieties) and creamers needed. We appreciated the lovely interior, especially the basket of comfy throws in the living room. The beds were very comfortable with nice quality bedding. If my sister and I make a return ancestry research trip we would definitely stay again. I highly recommend! Great host! Great value!"

This was the cleanest AirBnb that we have ever stayed at. We even loved the red heeler that was the welcoming comittee when we got back to the AirBnb that night and he hung out with us on the porch. He was so sweet! It was a very good value for the price. We also thought it was awesome that there were fresh eggs on the porch in the morning. We will definitely be back!"

I didn’t use the arena since we had riding plans already, but it was freshly dragged and the footing looked good. Definitely a place I’d stay again."

Stayed one night","This place was perfect for a one night stay for two. We were in town for a wedding so we weren't needing anything big. Just something for a quick change and to rest our heads at the end of the night. When we arrived the place was neatly kept and smelled fresh and clean. It was a little hard to find, but was cute and quiet and had a great country feel. We were also pleased with the cost as hotels alway raise prices on a busy weekend, but again for what we needed it was perfect. Melanie was kind to allow us to take our small dog for a small/fair price this also was a plus when we were looking for somewhere to stay."

We didn’t get any pictures as we were just there for a short time (hit a deer on the way in, had to leave early for the eclipse), but the pictures Melanie has listed are exactly what it’s like in person. The bed was so comfy and soft and the towels were plush. Melanie was the best with her prompt communication even though I messed up some things when I booked the place. She graciously adjusted and made our stay as comfortable as can be. Definitely recommend."

It is definitely a showcase home, straight out of a magazine, and while the cleaning fee is really high for less than 24 hours in the home-I understand why. If you know retail brands-the furnishings & linens are all 5 star and the home is immaculate. It is an excellent Air B&B, and we will definitely be back, as our daughter will be a freshman at TSU next year, and her sister the following year. 💜💖"

Stayed with kids","The Patricia was a well equipped and a great place to stay, Barbie was super sweet, welcoming and responsive.. The home had everything we needed to be comfortable especially while we escaped the unseasonably warm heat during the heart of the day.
The beds were comfortable and my girls loved the room with 2 queen beds..
Not being use to hail and having a truck with a sunroof I had a bit of a scramble when we got some golf ball sized hail and I had to scramble at night to find cover.. this isn’t a negative on the place but it would have been great to have some covered parking so I didn’t have to worry at night the rest of the stay.
We would be happy to stay here again on our next visit.."

Stayed with kids","We have stayed at many vacation rentals, from LA to Istanbul, but this one was probably the most impressive. The place itself is lovely, a home redone with thoughtful attention to detail everywhere. The location is great. There are not a ton of restaurants on the square but you can certainly walk to a few. We loved sitting outside at the firepit and letting the kids roast marshmallows. Stephenville is not far from Glen Rose, Dinosaur World, Dinosaur Valley State Park, and Fossil Rim. So if you are looking for a great jumping-off point that is beautiful and comfortable, this is it. But we were most touched by the many little details added (details that many owners would not want to spend money on): from the plentiful amount of K-cups for the coffee maker, to the candy jars in the pantry, from the gold laminated book that told you all about the space and the town to the beach towels in the closet, from the pancake mix, oatmeal, and other necessities on hand, truly every want or need was anticipated. I loved the counter-top crushed ice machine! We will definitely stay here again whenever we are in the area. My two boys LOVED the house and referred to it as The White House, asking often if we could live there. Thank you for a wonderful stay!"

I also really enjoyed that the house is only a couple of blocks from the city park. My daughter and I would go on walks frequently there. The house itself is gorgeous and you will feel so welcomed with Barbie as your host. We stayed for an entire month and this is truly a home away from home.

Stayed a few nights","The home was cute and very nicely done inside and the furnishings were comfortable. Kitchen overall was very clean and the spacious fridge was perfect for all the food we bought for the party. We came for a birthday party for our grandchild, so we didn't spend a lot of time in the home except for early AM and evening. The island was great for preparing food trays to take to the party. It rained the whole weekend and we were glad it had a concrete drive. but had to angle park my Tahoe to keep it out of the street. Would recommend extending drive alongside of the house a little for the longer vehicles, but obviously a smaller vehicle would fit just fine. Overall, it suited our needs well."

Stayed a few nights","I'm so pleased with my decision to sandwich my 110 mile gravel bike ride out of Hico between nights at Miriam's place in Stephenville. The clean, homey place was only 20 minutes or so drive away from the start of the ride. It allowed me to prep for the ride night before, sleep well, get up at a reasonable time, prepare my own breakfast, and make a short drive in. Afterwards, I didn't have to drive all the way back to Fort Worth. I returned, hosed off my bicycle, did a small load of laundry, grabbed a bite from any number of familiar places on the South Loop, slept and headed home in the morning. I could see a small family or two couples making this a base for a trip to the area. However, don't plan on it for Gravel Locos, I may have it already :-)..."

Stayed a few nights","I’m hesitant to give this glowing review because I don’t want Mimi’s to be booked by others while we’re there visiting our daughter at Tarleton in the next four years. But we have to tell you it’s perfect, for us. Quiet neighborhood, very close to Tarleton, and completely updated and fresh inside. It had everything we need, and extra items we didn’t realize we needed (that our host did). We’ve stayed at many AirBnB locations over the years, but none more fitting. Easy but secure number lock entry, extremely well-lit grounds with fixed and motion lighting, and well-maintained grounds. Extra coffee and teas, butter and eggs in the fridge, multiple sets of towels, and clean, very soft sheets. It’s a gem."

There is space in the fenced in back yard if you have kids and a nice covered porch to relax. Plenty of coffee, washer and dryer easy to use; felt very homey. Would definitely stay again."

Great location in town, close enough but not so close that it’s noisy. Make sure you check out Caam’s Pizza and Grumps Burgers… 6 minute drive to both! Downtown was charming and close.
Jamie was a great host, she gave us clear and timely instructions, and was very friendly.
The entire townhome was absolutely spotless, and comfortably decorated without being fussy. The attached garage was a great perk! Perfect amount of space to relax and just hang out together. We immediately felt at home!
This will definitely be a place we keep on our favorites list!"

Overall, the host was very responsive and cared greatly about our stay and made sure to check in. She even offered a partial refund due to unforeseen work that was being done to the unit outside. We would be happy to stay here again in the future and would highly recommend this space to anyone!"

Basic toiletries were there, in case you forgot something. Bed was super comfy. All light switches are labeled so you don't have to search for the right one. Perfect place to stay & visit my daughter at Tarleton."

Stayed a few nights","The apartment was more beautiful in the pictures than it was in person. It was equipped with everything I needed and more. I was in love with all the textures, furniture, etc. that went into the design. It was like staying in a space I wish to create in my home. The backyard was super cute and Lauren and Andres were very helpful with all their instructions and information for my stay. I met Andres while staying on site and he was super polite and desired feedback on how to make the space better. They are doing a great job to just be getting started. Stay here if you’re visiting in stephenville. I will be back if it’s available during my next trip."

Stayed with a pet","Thank you for a wonderful stay! We had to bring our dogs to our child's freshman orientation at TSU and this was the perfect place for our crew... family of 5 and our pets. Something that stuck out: They had a sunroom that has concrete floors and a doggy door going outside to the fenced in yard. It was perfect. Pool was beautiful, and it was just a wonderful atmosphere to cook steaks on the charcoal grill after a long orientation day.
Thanks again for your hospitality!"

Group trip","The house is older, but nice. It’s worth noting there was a sewer smell that started the last day we were there. I did not notify Jenny about it because it was the evening of our last day there and we just dealt with it. Also the first night the air conditioner was erratic - in the middle of the night it dropped the temperature down to 65° - the comforter on the bed in the master bedroom is thin - not warm and cozy so I woke up freezing having a hard time warming up. My husband got up and figured out the thermostat, so night two was better…but again it’s worth noting - bring an extra blanket with you! One of the spare bedrooms did not have a comforter on the bed but we found one in the master closet. A little annoying considering we pay cleaning fees. The pool was also dirty, and not sparkly clean as pictured; and there was no welcome snack basket as pictured in the listing either. However…with all of that the house fit our needs for the occasion we were in town for."

Group trip","The place was priced right, good location, plenty of room, there was nothing on the rental description that it was on a septic system and they had a sign in eat bathroom saying no toilet paper down the toilets so u had to put it in trash cans, that completely grossed us out, the water pressure in the kitchen Barley came out to wash dishes in the sink or too take a shower and the heater control was erratic, rooms were not controlled evenly. The windows were sealed shut and. Couldn’t be opened so in case of a fire we couldn’t get out. There was not enough toilet paper, trash bags or dish soap but when I called Jenny, she brought it right over right away. The house is old but quaint. Decorated cute, furniture comfy, and layout great for family time. All and all we had a good time."

Definitely will confirm next time everything works as it should prior to booking. That alone made the price a bit steep.
Having said that the house was nice and very clean. Jenny was helpful but not as forthcoming with some details that would have impacted our decision."

Jenny worked with us on an early check-in so that our belongings didn't have to sit in our hot vehicle all afternoon. The house was super clean and there was plenty of parking. We didn't get to really enjoy the pool due to our schedule, but it was nice to put our feet in the next morning after a long day. The cleaning/check-out instructions were clear and not over the top like some places I've stayed in the past which we all appreciated.
We all agreed we would stay here again. Thank you again, Jenny, for the fantastic stay."

Air conditioning worked like a charm for the crazy Texas weather. Jenny's restaurant recommendations were amazing (Azteca). We felt right at home, peaceful, bed were comfortable as well.

Group trip","GREAT house, great location and LOVED the restaurant recommendations. You HAVE to try the Purple Goat. Only tip I would add is to take toiletries - there were none (I know, I know, it's not a hotel.......). We had to go on a slight scavenger hunt for paper towels and trash bags, but all in all - a GREAT stay."

Stayed with kids",We traveled to Stephenville’s to lay my father to rest and we wanted a nice place for my sisters and I to stay together. We showed up and the house had everything to fit each of our needs. There was a slight hiccup with the pool but Jenny and her daughter were quick to get that fixed. Overall the house was an amazing stay for us. I’d recommend this house ten times over.

Group trip","Jenny's place offered our immediate family (who are normally spread all over the country) a nice, welcoming place to stay and make happier memories after a difficult week of a family member passing and a funeral in a nearby town. Though it was not yet pool season, we all remarked what a great place it would be to have a pool party with friends or family."

The house is decorated so nice and comfortable. The kitchen is perfect. That marble counter top ohhhhh my... it is so well stocked and everything seemed so new. The TV outside was so nice.

Group trip",We wanted to express our heartfelt gratitude for the beautiful accommodations and the incredible warmth of “southern hospitality” during our stay in Stephenville. Their personal touch and excellent communication truly made our experience memorable. Being able to gather with our extended family to celebrate a graduation was made even more special by the comfortable and welcoming environment they provided. We are truly grateful for their contributions to our delightful stay. We wish them continued success in creating wonderful experiences for your future guests.

I really appreciate the quick response from the host, very interactive, friendly and accommodating.
The outside surroundings were very country, peaceful, and quiet. I especially loved the tree swing. I would definitely recommend this place all day every day. We will definitely be back."
