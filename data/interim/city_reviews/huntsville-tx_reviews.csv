Stayed a few nights","WARNING!! Stacy’s place is clean and quiet in an upscale neighborhood outside of town. However I cannot recommend it. The host failed to unlock lower door and would not respond when I messaged for help. I had to rent a hotel room in town that night. Apparently Airbnb could not convince her to provide access even though I had a reservation and paid for it.
To get in, you need keys which are in a lock box INSIDE the lower door. If the lower door is locked at check-in, the guest has no access. Stacy never messaged or showed up while I waited two hours in the dark in a rainstorm. I had to drive to town and found a hotel. No help from Airbnb either. Strange behavior. Cannot recommend this host or Airbnb."

Stayed a few nights","Stacy is truly a super host. Stacy was always quickly responsive when I had a question. She was just so friendly and so accommodating and her husband, too, as I got to meet him. He even carried my luggage upstairs! The studio apartment is just the right size and arranged so well. Loads of amenities and it looked like it was just upgraded as everything felt so new and fresh. Beautifully decorated too and the studio really made you feel ""at home"". Also, the subdivision is perfect for walking or running and the only thing I encountered on my early morning runs were deer...no wild animals, no dogs unleashed, no fast vehicles. Just a very tranquil and lovely community. Stacy and her studio apartment really did make my week stay in Huntsville awesome. Thank you, Stacy, and a huge thanks to your husband, too. I know where I will be staying next trip...just hoping the studio is available...fingers crossed.

The amount of natural light coming in during the day makes it an ideal place to study, write, work, or meditate.
The location makes it feel remote, yet it is a very easy 5-10 minute drive back to Huntsville and the university campus.
I will be bookmarking this listing and checking for its availability before anywhere else any time I am working in Huntsville."

The studio is completely independent of the house, bright, spotless, very well equipped, modern and very pleasant. We were even able to use the washing machine and dryer.

The owners are top notch. April was very patient and responsive to my multiple questions, and her husband helped us when our son locked us out of the cabin, and he went above and beyond the call of duty by taking our sons to their private fishing hole where they caught some nice sized brim and catfish. This is the perfect place to escape the fast-paced city life and make wonderful memories with your family!"

Every morning, we let our fur baby run around outside and we would eat breakfast on the porch. The sound of the wind through the trees was magical. The cozy cabin had all of our necessities!!! We brought groceries to cook dinner and all appliances were in great condition, pots and pans were provided! This is the perfect place to unwind and have a relaxing getaway!"

Stayed with kids","I booked my stay so that I would have two opportunities to visit the blue lagoon(which was awesome). This place was its own piece of paradise. I didn't even know it had a hot tub when booking and ask me if I got in when it was 110 degrees outside? I sure did! it had controls to manage the heat, and I put it low so it felt like a warm pool. Surrounded by the sounds of nature and not another house and person in sight. I could not tell you how much I didn't know I needed that. Inside the house was pretty awesome, too. Internet was surprisingly super fast, we played a board game and watched some TV in the cold crisp air. The water smelled a little funky but we the host left water so we didn't drink any. We both walked and drove to the creek nearby but I wasn't brave enough to swim in it. I did have to reach out because I left something and the host left it out so I could grab it. I appreciated that so much! I would definitely stay again."

Stayed one night","April is the absolute best host! Not only is the cabin clean and welcoming with everything and anything you need, they are also amazing humans! We took my fur babies on this short / quick trip and of course one of my dogs decided to take a little adventure and decided to take a tour of the land while we were out to dinner. The cabin does have a little doggie door but my dog mind you is definitely not little and probably a good 60 pounds… it didn’t even cross my mind she would be able to FIT through the dog door, long story short … April messaged me right away letting me know the dogs were out and about running around and she was so KIND to put them back in the cabin for me and made sure my dogs couldn’t get out anymore!!! What the host didn’t know is I just lost a dog of 14 years from old age and my poor heart is still broken from it… I can’t even imagine what I would do if it wasn’t for April and her family!
The best place to stay HANDS DOWN!
Thank you for a great stay ❤️"

You have all you need for a quiet stay in the country. The hottub was soothing, and the daybed was great to curl up on and read while taking in the view of the woods. We had some heavy rain and April reached out to let us know where flashlights and candles were before hand. The metal roof made the storm that much better. We will definitely be back for a longer stay in the future."

Beautiful getaway from anything around the city and see all the beautiful scenery! And at night you can see all the stars it’s perfect. April was also very very helpful and responsive.

Rosi’s place fit our party of 7-8 adults comfortably. There was also a wonderful greeting gift of snacks and cookies in the kitchen for us. So thoughtful. Well stocked kitchen with utensils, cups, keurig, tea bags, etc, but would recommend a few more large coffee mugs!
Had a little hiccup with housekeeping accidentally bolting the front door from the inside so we couldn’t get in that way, but Rosi was so responsive and it got sorted out really quickly, so wasn’t an issue!

We had a little trouble with check in but Rosi was a VERY responsive host and let us know reasons beyond her control that was delaying our check in. The home itself offered way more than we expected. It was so BIG, I don’t think I’ve stayed in an Airbnb this large but I loved it! It was so nice to have especially since we have some early birds in our group that would be making coffee/breakfast in the kitchen which you can’t hear over in the bedroom area. The carpets were so clean and light we were so nervous we would get them dirty but we made sure to wipe our feet well and remove shoes as needed. We bbq’d Friday and Sunday night and it was so peaceful outside. The neighborhood was quiet and we felt safe the whole time. I’m not sure we will have the opportunity to stay again as we normally don’t travel with a large group but we would 10/10 stay here if we do."

The only draw back was the heavy truck traffic on the road in front of the cottage that I understand to be just temporary while they are building a housing addition down the way. I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend it to others!!

My only complaint is that the property is very close to the road so as a light sleeper I was woken up anytime a car would pass by. I was looking for something a bit more secluded or private. Other than that I had a great time hiking and visiting Huntsville. This was a great value stay but maybe bring some ear plugs if you are a light sleeper. Thank you Terri.

We loved the location being so close to the state park and downtown Huntsville. Terri was easy and very quick to communicate with. And I mentioned briefly while booking we were there for our anniversary to Terri and we walked into a cute card and bottle of champagne congratulating us. So thoughtful and we appreciated it so much!

If you are planning to use the sofa to sleep, it is a little firm. Other than that, the place is quaint and I would stay again. Spend some time on be porch, it’s wonderful! Thanks for hosting us."

The extra touches such as additional blankets, coffee/tea, room fan, and being pet friendly were very appreciated. Shiplap on the walls, vintage kitchen sink, and fireplace (non-working of course) added to the historical decor. For history buffs, it was a nice surprise to be across the street from Sam Houston's grave, located in a very old cemetery, which has interesting historical markers throughout. Although parking is on the street, and being an older home, there are two steps from the street and two more steps to the front porch. The bathroom has had a nice renovation, although the shower is on the small side. Towels were of a lovely quality. We would stay here again, and can definitely recommend to others."

I stayed here with a girlfriend and it was just right for the two of us. Would book again! If you plan on cooking they have all utensils and pans, but bring olive oil/seasonings etc. Host was great and very accommodating too!"

Stayed a few nights","This is the perfect getaway and I know we will be back. Dealing with John was quick, efficient and very friendly and helpful. The cabin is beautiful inside and out and super clean. The living area is beautiful and reminded me of Swiss chalets. The kitchen is very well equipped, the bedrooms are large, the beds are great and bathrooms nice and clean. In fact, everything is super clean. During pandemic times this is an excellent and safe place to be! We ate our meals outside on the large deck and enjoyed the view of the pond and various livestock. (They are behind a fence for those who worry) I enjoyed long walks through the vineyard and admired the winery. I look forward to coming back and to sharing this secret with my friends."

It's amazing that such a peaceful place is just a short drive from Houston. We enjoyed hiking in the Sam Houston National Forest during the day and coming home to the super comfortable and well stocked cabin including a great kitchen and really comfy beds. We look forward to visiting again!"

This is a great cabin. Plenty of room for a family. Great deck and fire pit looking out over vineyards. Clean and well furnished.
Oh, and there’s a freaking winery on site! You mean there’s a place you can go to get wine and never run out? Yes, please.
We’ll definitely be back."

If you're looking for a peaceful respite in a lovely rural setting with the comforts of a well-appointed home, this is it! Our cabin had a breathtaking vista of the pasture, vineyard and pond. Their wine tasting with a Christmas ambiance was lovely. Visiting with the farm animals, including the 'zebronkeys', was a highlight. The winery's two affectionate Pyrenees dogs kept us company on our deck every morning. Our host and his family made us feel very welcomed. We'll be back soon!"

A large ranch (even by Texas standards!), beautiful vineyards, medal-winning winery, well-appointed cabins, an incredibly-responsive host (Sandy), magnificent landscape, and proximity to the Sam Houston national forest made for a truly memorable stay. We spent two nights and traveled to this property with our two children. We highly recommend this property and look forward to going back in the coming months. Way to go -- Keep up bar high, Sandy!"

Stayed a few nights","This is the most unusual Air BnB we have had the pleasure of staying at. It was beautiful, the accomodations were lovely (our cabin was very well-appointed), and the amenities were awesome! The winery was a wonderful place to relax and sample some fine Texas wines (we were also able to tour the winery production room - a neat experience!) Diego answered all of our wine questions and provided interesting information about the wines and the process for making them. We sampled white and red wines made from grapes grown on the property while watching the wildlife residing on the ranch. The wildlife includes donkeys, a zebra, 2 offspring called ""zebronkeys"", Great Pyrenees dogs who guard the livestock (and like to play with them), Black angus cattle, and more. The dogs are super-friendly and hung out with us at our cabin a couple of times. Our cabin's back porch looked out over some vineyards, pastures and a lake with a gazebo. It was so pretty. There are also fire pits available at the cabins and at the winery sampling building, where you can sit and relax on the patio. Overall, it is a really well-done Air BnB place to relax for a few days. Side note: there was also a camel in-residence, but it passed away suddenly over the summer. The plan is to bring in a mama and baby camel sometime in 2020. We would love to return and meet them!"

Unfortunately, the home wasn't as clean as I'd hoped it would be, with small bugs coming in through the gap in the front door (doorknob), dust, and old stains. Though Maria helped a lot with the AC situation, it was either very cold or very warm at night, so it was hard to sleep.
Unfortunately, the main negative factor is likely out of their control, specifically the neighbors who drive past on their gators, blasting music and waving their flags. Was decent as a last minute accommodation but won't return."

We had a blast swimming in the little lake and playing on the boats and jumping off the dock. The cabin was clean and welcoming! We will definitely be back soon to have some more fun!!

The Outlook Cabin was perfect for us - cute, cozy and just enough space for the 5 of us. While cooking, I accidentally flipped a breaker, but it was fixed within just a few minutes of letting them know. Their ranch has something for everyone. If you like fishing, visiting all the animals, horseback riding, or you can just sit back and relax. We thoroughly enjoyed our time again!! We will definitely be back and hopefully with more friends next time!"

Stayed with kids","My husband, son, and I came up to Huntsville to visit our daughter who lives up here. My biggest takeaway from this weekend was the serenity of the ranch. We were able to sit altogether as a family around the fire pit Saturday night, which is rare since our daughter moved up here. The animals are delightful. I didn't get a chance to meet Cheri in person, but her communication through text was wonderful. Mr. Williams was very friendly and very informative. We laughed over the golf cart, which came with our cabin, when it broke down then provided another golf to replace it. Having that as an amenity was a godsend because I am disabled. I was able to get around the property with no problems. We will be coming back to Williams Ranch next time we come up to visit our daughter. 🥰"

Stayed one night","Place was in a great location and had lots of cool animals. However, it was freezing cold inside and there were ceiling vents but they were controlled from the attached residence and if there was a way to turn the heat up we couldn’t find it. Due to this, we were too cold to take advantage of using the provided golf cart to see the animals and had to go sit in my truck to stay warm. The place was kinda small but fit the needs we had for an overnight stay for two people, we didn’t use the fold out bed in the living room but it looked like it would be better suited for a youngster and not an adult. It did have all the described animals and amenities as far as I could tell and would be a great stay with kids in the spring or early summer. The bed is against the wall and my wife and I are in our sixties so climbing over each other to go to the restroom at night was also a bit of a challenge.
Cheri herself was pleasant in our communication and the directions were spot on."

We are super appreciative that Ronnie and Cheri took the time to introduce us to almost all of them, it was worth the price of admission to watch the joy on my daughters face as she fed Louie the Lemur, picked up chicken eggs, and pet the baby goats. We didn't get to enjoy swimming in the beautiful lake, but will be sure to do so next time. We'll definitely be back!"

Things we especially loved - the huge master bathroom with walk-in shower and vanity made from antique buffet - cute laundry room - the back porch was the perfect place to relax with drinks in the evening and enjoy the peaceful farm scene with orange marmalade cat and chickens in their coop for company - the MOST comfortable living room napping sofa.

It was very charming. Throughout the month, Calicia totally respected my privacy. Then on Christmas day I found that she had dropped a gift bag on the porch. It held sweet treats, a candle, and a card. It was such a thoughtful touch, letting me know that I was in her and her family's thoughts on that special day.

So I booked this one on a whim. It was a beautiful digital sabbatical. No wifi. Lots of trees. Cows next to you and a pissed-off duck that wants food.
(Don't know what his deal was.)
The only caveat is:
It's REALLY small. For reference, I'm 6'2 and felt like Will Ferrel in Elf. Holy smokes, I hit my head EVERY day.
If you're on the smaller side you should be fine. Other than that, it was a great value and enjoyed the stay."

Calicia is an awesome host and even made up the couch bed for me when I was not able to climb into the loft bed do to me hurting my back before arrival. It is tiny, but well laid out. I live on a 40' Sea Ray most weekends and this was not that much smaller. I was a bit disappointed to find that the handheld shower head that is in the pictures was no longer there, but it was not a major issue. The place was very clean and suited me well for my visit for the area. I was basically there to sleep, so I did not require much. I will probably book again in September when I come up for another visit. If not this property, one of the other properties with 3 bedrooms as I have a couple of colleagues interested in staying there as well. Well worth the money spent and very easy to get in and out of.

This place was spectacular and exceeded expectations. Cecilia was responsive, friendly, and made the process extremely easy. The tiny house was adorable and will consider again next time we are in Huntsville."

The location is also perfect if you want to get away from civilization and enjoy the outdoors. But you can also get to town in a few minutes. There are even animals on the farm for you to enjoy! Great value for your money!

Stayed a few nights","Tiny House On The Prairie is a very charming tiny house. Calicia was a great host, and was very responsive to my many questions leading up to our stay (this was our first Air BNB). We love the front porch drinking coffee and watching the sun rise, or looking at the stars. The ducks were wonderful visiting every morning (they are very tame not aggressive). The Tiny house had every thing we needed, from the bathroom to the kitchen.

I would recommend moving the stairs for the loft more to the middle during your stay, it made it easier for my wife and I to get in and out of the lofted bed.

I would definitely recommend Tiny house for average sized people, the bathroom and loft can be a bit tight for larger folks, like myself.

I would definitely stay in one of Calicia properties in the future she was a great host."

The first thing I noticed opening the front door was the magical view of the creek and steep banks from the window. It was like a painting. Very clean and adorable inside.
We slept in the master bedroom and it was so comfy, from the mattress to the super soft linens.
Dana was very sweet and responsive. Really enjoyed texting with her.
It rained the majority of the time and we enjoyed watching the creek flow and the pretty lights lit up the back yard so we could see it better.
Never saw any insects or spiders inside, even with all the rain. It was so cute and cozy, we hated to leave but will definitely be back.
Thank you both so much!"

We spent 3 nights there and oriented ourselves to the cabin/area the 1st night (took another reviewer's advice and stocked up on groceries at Brookshire Brothers in Trinity/a 10-minute drive). On the 2nd day, we took a day trip to Huntsville State Park for hiking and kayaking. On the 3rd day, we rented a pontoon from the folks at Bethy Creek Marina and spent the day fishing. It was overcast most days, so that really helped to keep things cool. All in all, we had a really great time and are grateful to Dana for hosting!"

But, we let her know that it was there when we opened the closet and the response time was great. Of course we cleaned it up so not to get hurt. But everything was perfect besides that. We would totally go back for another week and maybe bring our nieces next time. We really loved the decor as well. It took us back to when we were younger. Can’t wait to go back!

As a Dutch family living in Houston for a while, this was a great experience. Our kids loved being outdoors, doing hikes, canoeing and make a camp fire. And constantly trying to spot alligators and fishes of course. It’s a nice cabin with enough space. Even though the master bed is not very big (at least for tall persons as Dutchies are), the mattress is very good, which makes it comfortable.

Stayed with kids","Super-cute and comfortable house with wonderful hosts. Lots of extras make for plenty to do for both adults and kids. The hosts have pretty much thought of everything with this place! I loved how close the creek was to the house, as we were renting mostly with fishing in mind. The calm surface of the water was deceptive as there was apparently a lot going on underneath - right behind the house, we caught many fish (several types), and my husband even caught turtles. There were also many fish that got away with just eating the worms off our hooks. Tip: the gas stations just about 3 miles from the house, near Shorewood at 980 I think, have live and artificial bait and other fishing supplies. If the fish right behind the house aren't big enough for you, you can paddle in the canoe toward the larger part of Bethy Creek to try that area. My husband had fun exploring in the canoe and spotted and heard some cool wildlife. Our daughter and I were visited by a hummingbird. Our daughter loved playing with the provided indoor and outdoor toys, and loved the little sandy area near the creek, the hammock, watching Netflix, the star-projector nightlight, etc! We also appreciated the later than usual check-out time and the lighter than usual check-out duties. Wish we could have stayed another night!"

Inside was so clean and ready for us! We had treats waiting and all the tvs had a cozy fireplace set. Bathrooms were spotless (as was the rest of the house) and host checked in to make sure all was well. Would definitely stay here again!!

When the kids got tired of swimming, they would hang out in the game room. Beds were comfortable and the rooms are so cute! They provided all the necessary amenities. We were truly impressed and can’t wait to book again soon! Thank you for having us."

Definitely has its quirks, and we had some minor issues at check in and working some of the fixtures, BUT the host was very responsive throughout our entire trip. They did leave an extra trash bag, however, with a group of 8 or larger, I would definitely recommend bringing extra trash bags/toilet paper/paper towels. We had a great stay overall and would stay again!"

Group trip","This place looks amazing on the listing. However, for the price, it lacks some attention to detail. The master bed frame was missing, so the mattress was on the floor. There were multiple lights missing bulbs. This made it difficult to get ready for the wedding that we were attending. There were only 2 trash bags in the kitchen. We stayed three nights. We made a decent amount of trash, so that was inconvenient. When I finally found the outdoor trash bin, it was already full as well.
The master bath had a shower that took 5 minutes to get hot water. The other bathroom only had a tub, so guests had to use the master to take a shower. That was quite inconvenient. The kitchen was so small with dated cabinets, an oven that was small, and an oversized refrigerator that kept the dishwasher from opening. The swing chairs are cute but totally impractical because the table was too tall for the height of the swings. Two of the dining chairs were bent/broken. So, we couldn't all sit down together for a meal. We had difficulty with 8 people, so I have no clue how this house would function with 12 people. Overall, the house is pleasing in pictures but not practical in person."

The garage is a little fun bonus as after the wedding we were able to just hang out and not have to worry about the noise level outside.
A couple of us arrived a bit earlier for the rehearsal and they were super accommodating in letting us check in early, overall great experience and I would highly recommend this house and their hosts!!"

We were so busy with the pool we forgot about the cool game room in the garage. The kitchen was loaded and had beautiful dish ware! Unfortunately, I brought some tongs and scissors to grill my fajitas which I left behind. I wasn’t able to use the grill, but I got to use the cool oven. So it all worked out! The beds were comfortable and we slept like babies. If I have another opportunity for a staycation, you bet we’ll be there."

Check in was a little overwhelming due to a misunderstanding. Cleaners were still inside the home when we arrived and we weren’t aware. They didn’t let the owner know they were running behind so when I contacted them
They were as confused as I was. However; they did everything in their power to fix the issue and not have that intervene with our evening. They offered to take the cleaning fee off and went above and beyond to make the rest of our stay a relaxing and awesome one. They replied to my messages very quick so they are easy to contact in case we had any further questions.
The home is so aesthetically pleasing . Every room took my breath away. The decor is beautiful and it has everything guests may need. The pool
Has more than enough floaties for the whole family and the play room is awesome for the kids . My toddler absolutely loved the playground as a break from the pool ; so that’s a great addition too .
It’s a perfect home for a family’s staycation."

The home was very spacious & roomy for the three of us, the kitchens needed a few more amenities to be able to cook more meals at home but Diego was very receptive to adding those needed things. The mini fridge with cold drinks was a very nice and much appreciated after a hot day in the Texas humidity. The waterfall shower in the master bedroom was amazing and I would stay again for that alone. Diego is a very responsive host, and his home was a perfect for our first stay in Texas."

Stayed a few nights",I have Abnb properties also while being the Operations Manager for our company. I see the reviews and feedback we get. We get a lot of - not worth the money when it priced very modest with multiple beds and bathrooms. This location was worth the money. Very very nice comfortable clean accomidations that included multiple private sleeping areas and seperate private bathrooms. That - is worth the money.

Stayed a few nights","Mark communicates before, during, and after stay very well. Was tentative to offer us a great stay and paid attention to our needs. With our schedule and his, we kept missing each other in person. However, I felt very comfortable coming and going from his home. BNB room was tidy and spacious. Window unit kept it very cool (which was awesome)! TV in room. Bathroom close. Older home - not fancy, but clean, cozy, and convenient… as advertised on listing.
Couple of posting photos are of a historical home that is next door - which proved a little deceiving in identifying actual location. Cost with cleaning is very affordable. Host generous and offers availability to guests or allows privacy if preferred.
Bring own personal toiletries and bathing products. Towel(s) provided along with bottled water and small snack.
If you’re looking for an extravagant experience, - choose another bnb… if you want a modest room with a kind & caring host - this is a great choice!
Thank you - MMA."

We ended up having something come up last minute, so we were unable to complete our checkout dives and thus go to hunstville. Matthew communicated extremely well throughout the whole process, and gave us great confidence in our travel plans before we had to call them off. We plan on completing our checkout dives in August and plan to rebook with Matthew then."

Stayed a few nights","I stayed at matthews for a little more than a month on and off while I was working in Huntsville. Idk what the last person was talking about in her review. Yes the parking lot is across the street from his house but 90% of the time it is empty besides Matthew's truck and his roommates car. Also the street you have to cross is a small 2 lane back street with very little almost non existant traffic so walking across it is not even a second thought. The house is older but is in fact clean. It just has the usual signs of an older house which is no problem. The room is very big, like stated in the description it is a living room converted to a bedroom for guests. Its has a couch a large 50+ inch TV with an Amazon fire stick so if you have a Netflix or hulu or Amazon prime account you can use it and it is very nice. The only things you should be aware of that are not necessarily cons, at least not to me are that the bed is a twin bed so couples would have a hard time sleeping together but he does have a cot that can be arranged next to the bed. And the second things is that there are not actual doors but 2 sliding track curtains on either side of the room. There not really curtains but I cant thing of another way to describe them. They offer 100% privacy but they are not lockable, it shouldn't be a concern, it wasnt for me, because Matthew seems like a very honest and trustworthy host as does his room mate but something that I figured I should mention.
I give this place 5 stars for being an awesome budget place to stay, with an amazing host, all the basics and some nice extras. If you want the 5 star hotel experience then this isnt the place but you cant expect that for the price. But it does offer a whole lot more than what you pay and easily beats out any motel 6 or super 8 and even some nicer hotels youd pay twice the cost."

Stayed one night","The good about Matthew's Place:
First of all, this young man is very nice. Since the parking is off-site, he was king to offer to help us carry all our luggage in. He is personable, will talk to you, seems genuinely friendly & kind.
And everything else about Matthew's Place:
I read reviews. I rent out rooms in my own home, and I've done this for nearly 19 years. I kind of know what is to be expected with common spaces & renting rooms. I was appalled to say the least, and I'm wondering where on earth all these ""sparkling clean"" reviews came from -- this place was NOT clean at all. I will not go into all the detail here, because it's been shared with Matthew; however just be aware what the profile says. There are two young male college students living here (no mom, as described in one photo), just two guys & a dog. Please be prepared the standards might not be what you would expect from all other airbnb'ers.
In addition, just so you know because this is not in the description of the house, the parking is off-site. It's a small ""parking lot"" that is adjacent from the house; however you are crossing over (I think) 3 lanes of traffic. There is no crosswalk & the cars do not have a stop sign or a light. This is not easy with anyone elderly or when carrying lots of baggage."

Stayed a few nights","Thanks again Matt, you were a great host. My big room was super comfy and the bathroom close by. Everything was very clean and had a homey feeling. The bed was very comfortable and the linens too. I enjoyed watching some shows on TV last night that I missed last week, as I wound down for the night. The only thing I can complain about is missing your dog! Hopefully next time he will be home rather then at grandma’s!! See you in a few months when I come to visit my boys again!
Good luck with school!

Stayed one night","This is a wonderful home right in the middle of the City. Matthew is warm and caring and takes his job as a host very seriously. This was a last minute need for a place to stay during a very stressful time, this was my first AirBnb since the hotels where not available. This was the best decision ever.. With such a rave review, I hope it will be available again Lol.."

Matt is very helpful and attentive in every way that a host can be. Also I was very impressed with how clean and comfortable everything was.

Stayed a few nights",I so much enjoyed my stay here! I needed a place to stay until I moved into my new apartment and this was perfect! It was very private and surprisingly big. Almost like my own little studio. It had direct access to the kitchen and was right by the bathroom which was nice. Matt was an AWESOME host as well!! I will definitely stay here again if I ever need a place in Hunts. It is close to anything you would need. Thank you again Matt.

Stayed one night","This post is on behalf of my sister in law Anna, this is what she thinks:
“I stayed in Matthew’s place while taking my daughter to orientation at SHSU and the experience was very pleasant. He is an excellent host,I felt very relaxed and at ease .He keeps his house very tidy and neat and he is very amicable and kind which makes want to come back to his place whenever I am in town again.
P.S did I say his house is very close to all important places I needed to go?”"

Stayed a few nights",On a business trip to Huntsville I knew that I would be busy much of the time and would not need many amenities. This was just fine for my needs. Near the campus. Easy access. Clean and comfortable. I would stay there again.

Stayed a few nights","Matt was fantastic! The place was exactly as described, and I was pleasantly surprised with how comfortable and clean the room was. Matt even let us use all his streaming services and we had a really nice AC unit in the room. Matt was extremely communicative, gave quick responses, and was more than willing to help us AND accommodate our very late check-in. I would definitely stay with Matt again!"

Stayed one night","Wonderful experience overall and very affordable! The location of the home was very close to local shops and restaurants and most conveniently walking distance from Sam Houston State University. Our host Matthew provided excellent hospitality every step of the way making us feel welcome in his home. He was friendly and attentive to all of our needs. The home was very clean and simple and there was a plenty of privacy. You even have the option in the room to control the thermostat which is a very nice feature. Overall, if you are looking for a clean, simple, and affordable place to stay I highly recommend this home!!! Great experience!"
