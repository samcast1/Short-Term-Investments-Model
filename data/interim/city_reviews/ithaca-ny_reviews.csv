Stayed a few nights","Very pleased with this place, would stay here again. Calyn is a very responsive host, replied to inquiries promptly. Gave us a refund of the cleaning fee after we found linens and towels in the washer and dryer when we arrived (we finished washing them and put them away). Speaking of which, the washer and dryer worked great, very helpful in the middle of our trip. Nice kitchen, large living room. Great location, easy walk to Ithaca Commons. A few minuses: The bathroom was off the living room instead of the bedroom, so from the bedroom you have to walk through the kitchen and living room to get to the bathroom. Parking on Linn St. was available, but a little tight sometimes."

Stayed a few nights","Calyn’s place was the perfect home base for a long weekend getaway. We loved walking to the commons for dinner and to Gimme Coffee for our morning caffeine fix. Being right at Cascadilla Falls was great too.
The space was bright and clean, very pretty and cozy for a weekend. Even with people in the other apartments, it was nice and quiet.
So glad we picked this spot for our eclipse trip-everything is so close! Thanks for sharing this great space!"

Stayed a few nights","Cascadilla Flat is in a great location - very walkable to restaurants, shops and a couple of the nearby waterfalls. The decor is also very well curated and inviting. Overall, it was good for the price and for a short stay. However, there were a few things that could be improved. The place was only ""kind of"" clean when we arrived - in that it seemed like the last guest(s) followed the check out cleaning instructions (which were kind of a lot considering the cleaning fee) and the cleaner only replaced the linens and completed a cursory wipe-down of the bathroom. There wasn't a shower head, which was a little odd since it's been mentioned as an issue in previous reviews from several months ago. Lastly, it was quite cold even with the space heater and provided blanket (which smelled as if it hadn't been washed in awhile)."

Stayed a few nights","Calyn’s listing is in a super convenient and walkable location, close to the Ithaca Commons and nature alike! The space was a bit more run down than expected unfortunately—peeling & cracking walls, older building feel, odd shower head. Be prepared to walk up a flight of stairs with your luggage. It’s well kept in the sense that the listing’s description is accurate and it’s not dirty, but it feels less comfortable than we would have hoped. Great for a shorter stay. If we were there more than a few days, I think these issues would have been a bigger deal. But can’t beat the convenience!"

The apartment has great natural light and is well appointed. The only small set-back is there's no parking included. I was able to get a spot around the corner easily, but parking is metered on the street right outside the front. Overall, still highly recommended."

Stayed one night","Cascadilla Flat is clean, sunny and bright, and decorated charmingly. If you’re looking for the hotel experience this isn’t it, as it’s dated but it’s all about the location. When we arrived we walked the Cascadilla glen trail up to Collegetown and Cornell’s campus, then returned for an evening meal on Ithaca Commons. Calyn provides delicious coffee and a French press so we were fueled up for a walk in the Plantations before we headed home. My husband thought the nightly rate was high but he hasn’t seen the Ithaca hotel rates!! I would definitely return."

It's compact, the kitchen is fairly small, and it's up a flight of stairs, but otherwise the space is accommodating. Airy and peaceful. Simple check in and out too. (You do need to strip the linens and take out the trash.) Stayed in October, so heat or cold not an issue."

So while yes, decorated adorably, practically after 14 hour day of work having half the people not having a clean space to sleep is not acceptable. We’d like to be reimbursed for the stay."

Stayed a few nights",Lovely apartment with plenty of room for a third person on the pull-out couch. Lots of extra linens available and the washer/dryer was a nice perk! It’s a beautiful old building in an amazing location - just across the street from a great little gorge trail at Cascadilla Creek. Also only a few blocks from downtown. Would absolutely stay here again.

Stayed one night","The location couldn't be better, right next to the gorge and a few blocks from downtown. Honestly, I was disappointed with this stay due to lack of cleanliness. We rented this place for my birthday and when I walked in to the bathroom, it was obvious the shower had not been cleaned nor the toilet (and unfortunately it seems like the previous user had explosive diarrhea which was not cleaned from the bowl). My boyfriend was sweet to clean it all but I was horrified to pay $200 for a super dirty, uninviting bathroom on my birthday. There were also yellow stains and tears in the bedding. This place definitely has a lot going for it, I hope the owner will be more considerate for future guests or lower the price."

Stayed one night","Really lovely historical building and great location. Quaint space with nice art and a welcoming vintage vibe. Good location for walking to downtown or the gorge hike around the corner.
Would have liked a heads up specifically that the heat is controlled by the downstairs tenant—we didn’t read the little binder of info until the morning—I lived in Ithaca so didn’t think I needed to read the suggestions booklet. We assumed the mechanism with a vent and a knob for low, med, high in the kitchen controlled the heat. We turned it on before we went to sleep—-I’m guessing now it was just a fan. Woke up to a very chilly house. Thankfully it was warm the day before.
Walked into the bathroom to find lots of different people’s hair on the bathroom floor and bathroom sink/counter. That was a little off-putting. But everything else seemed clean?
Sorry to say this, but it wasn’t worth the price by half. We stayed at the Argos Inn for the same price as this rental the next night. Same price after taxes and cleaning fee.
The housing market, am I right?"

We never had a problem finding parking on Linn St. right in front of the house The convenience and comfort of Calyn’s flat was perfect for our 3 day stay in Ithica. Just one thing to be aware of, if you are coming from out of the region. In the month of January many places close down and don’t open back for two weeks or until February or in the case of the trails, many are closed throughout the winter. But, if you are looking for a place to stay while you are in Ithica, you couldn’t find a better location than right here. Comfort, convenience and ease of communication with Calyn: 5 stars!"

Stayed a few nights","Calyn’s flat really was in a prime location, where I was able to walk along the Cascadilla Creek to my favorite coffee shop every day and the incredible Cascadilla Gorge is just steps away from the front door. Also, this apartment is all about natural lighting and the bedroom was really comfortable and airy. I also loved how quiet it was, even being so centrally located. There were some issues at the start of my stay that Calyn immediately tried to address; unfortunately, some just weren’t able to be resolved during my visit, and I’m not sure ultimately about the value of the price I paid versus the experience I had, but I still enjoyed my time there and think it’s a great choice for a stay in Ithaca."

parking was street parking only but we didn't have any issues with this during a 1-week stay. Calyn is very responsive and her guidebook was really helpful!"

Stayed a few nights","If you want to experience what it's like to live in one of the older homes in the historic district of downtown Ithaca, then the Cascadilla Flat is the place for you. The location is excellent. It's walking distance to the Ithaca Commons but yet on a quiet street with lovely homes. It's located just across the street frm the Cascadilla Falls trail head and Cornell University is right up the hill. It's a big hill but that is Ithaca. The Cascadilla Falls trail is so gorgeous, you hardly feel the hill. We loved the whole vibe of the house and the Flat. The vibe is thoughtful, creative, and original. Staying at Cascadilla Flat is a much more unique experience than staying in a hotel room and we enjoyed the extra space of the common area as we were visiting our son at college and it was fun to have a pizza dinner with him on Friday night when we came in and coffee and pastries with him on Sunday morning before we left. I highly recommend Thompson and Bleeker for wood fired pizza and Gimme Coffee for locally roasted coffee and pastries...all walking distance from the Cascadilla Flat. I loved the window seat that overlooked the street. The apartment was only about 4.5 miles away from the Robert Treman State Park. We enjoyed an amazing hike to Lucifer Falls. The parking at the Flat is street parking but it was free on Saturday and Sundays and it was easy to find a spot and there is a garage nearby if needed. You do have to climb two flights of stairs: one to get into the house and the other to get to the second floor. So, if stairs are a concern, then this might not be the house for you. We hope to stay at the Cascadilla Flat again. It was a relaxing and fun experience."

Stayed a few nights","We booked a last minute getaway to Ithaca and found Calyn's place which was one of the last available places. For the price of a luxury hotel, it was not worth it. There was leftover chinese food from previous guests in the refrigerator and the bathroom was not clean (hair in tub, dirty bathmat). She advertised that there would be fresh coffee/french press but none was to be found. Unfortunately we had to leave early due to illness and after reaching out to Calyn and requesting a refund for 1 nights stay, she ghosted us. The lack of customer service was disappointing, especially for such a high price. We loved the location, being able to walk to the falls and to downtown. Hoping that she changes some things for future guests."

We ate all our meals out, so didn't make use of the kitchen. It seemed well equipped, and although a small space all the essentials appeared to be there. We were delighted to fall to sleep in the comfy bed by the outside chorus of Spring Peeper frogs!"

Stayed a few nights","The cabin was very comfortable and cozy. When we saw that the temperature was dropping, we were concerned about being cold, but Heather and Jeremy have provided everything needed to stay nice and warm--lots of blankets and comforters and robes. But it turned out that the radiant heating that keeps the floor warm was almost all we needed.
We brought food we'd prepared at home, and the kitchen had all the tools and dishware we needed, plus tea and coffee. After going out to Moosewood for our daughter's birthday, we all came back and had a pleasant celebration with cake at the cabin.
The setting was relaxed, just what we needed, and we spent a lot of time being lazy. Heather and Jeremy provided clear instructions for everything. We didn't really need to get in touch with them during the stay, but we felt confident that they would have been helpful if we had been looking for recommendations or had encountered any problems.
We'd gladly come back during another season."

Stayed a few nights","Our stay was everything we were hoping for and more. Private and pristine, we loved the cozy ambience and the beautiful natural environment. Heather and Jeremy have thought of everything: from teas and coffees to extra bathroom supplies .. perfect if you forgot something on your trip. One small thing to note is that there is not a lot of open surface area to lay put your personal travel items. Not a problem if you're traveling lightly and don't have much stuff; we were on a longer road trip hence had more items and didn't really have much room to lay things out except on the floor. But other than that, it was great; if we're ever in the Ithaca area again we'd certainly stay here again: it's so close to all the amazing activities Ithaca has to offer and very comfortable. Thank you both again!"

Oh…there is also the bonus of having an Empire pass available to get into all of the state parks, which was the main purpose of my trip!
This was my first time back to Ithaca in 23 years, and I needed it to be extra special. Spending two days here was all that, and so much more. It is quiet, peaceful, and beautiful…the perfect place to unplug, unwind, and reflect on the good things in life. I really cannot say enough good things about this experience. So, thank you, Heather, for a memorable stay in my happiest place on earth. I am returning home with a lighter heart and a smile.

Little did we know however that Heather and her husband would greet us with the extraordinary kindness that they did! We sai our goodbyes with the promise that we would be back SOON, stay LONGER and hang out TOGETHER! We've raved so much about our one night stay that several friends have begged us for the link to this priceless spot. Hoping to return in the fall! Thank you Heather for sharing your hard work and beautiful heart."

The Airbnb matches the listing perfectly. The location is an easy 10-minute drive to downtown Ithaca. The heated floors were an added bonus for cold winter nights! While some prior guests have commented they found the list of rules burdensome, I appreciated how they made everything clear upfront. Highly recommended!!!"

Stayed one night","This is a tricky review to write. The place offered was exactly as described, but the experience of being there was not at all the relaxed getaway we dreamed of. We have stayed at many wonderful Airbnbs and none have felt as oppressive and particular in their expectations as this one. We are two responsible adults who understand the idea of treating someone else’s home with respect, but the intense list of rules/expectations/threats felt much more like staying at a strict grandma’s house than a retreat.
It is a beautiful, promising property and, with some tweaks, could really be a great place to enjoy.
Oh! Very important to note: the semi-sheer front and back door curtains do not allow full privacy!"

Stayed about a week","This was my first time in Ithaca, New York. I did not know where everything was as far as restaurants, stores, ect. however, once I stepped into Julie's Airbnb, I felt so at home! It made me feel like I had my own apartment. I felt so much peace walking in! Everything was very clean, organized, bed was AMAZING, and I felt just at peace. As a first semester graduate student this was a PERFECT Airbnb. I live in Dallas so I hear the traffic very loudly everyday, at Julie's place it was nothing but peace and quiet! I studied so well at Julie's place too! Anytime I needed something or had question Julie was quick to respond! Also if I needed help with something at her Airbnb, she was always there to help me out! I will definitely be back at Julie's Airbnb! Thank you for everything Julie!"

Stayed a few nights","Very nice peaceful stay. Super host Julie was perfect host. Only reasons gave a 4/5 instead of a 5 are below:
Bed was thin and not super comfortable.
Stairs going up to the apartment are very steep pitch and narrow. That along with a very splintery railing made it feel a bit precarious coming home at night. Highly recommend leaving the lights on before going out if coming back in the dark.
Also, notice there is no TV listed. We should have picked up on that because it was not mentioned in the description, i guess we just assume places all have TV and Netflix etc… would be a good touch for this place as we missed having that.
Otherwise lovely stay and good value. Very clean."

The location is close to town with its restaurants and local attractions (Ithaca Falls, the Farmers' Market, the Cascadilla Trail). Parking was never a problem. Maps and tourist information are in drawers in the kitchen for easy access. The neighborhood is quiet and we were comfortable.

Stayed a few nights","We loved Julie’s place. Everything was really well organized and thought out. Julie is clearly a very conscientious person who put a lot of effort into her place. She was great with communication and letting us know her expectations. We couldn’t have asked for a better host. The bedroom had nice darkening shades so we got great sleep, the mattress was comfortable, and the kitchen/living room was awesome to hang out in with plenty of spots to sit, read, eat, do yoga, and work. Every morning my husband I did some yoga on our mats, then made breakfast (really appreciated the toaster oven and electric water kettle- thank you Julie!!), walked to Gimme for coffee, and took some time to read or talk. We spent the afternoons on long walks and spent the evenings in watching movies on our laptop. We knew there wasn’t a tv so we brought a laptop and it worked out great. The connection was perfect. We also brought our own rice machine for dinners. In general, the kitchen was fully stocked and we found everything we needed. My husband really loved that aspect. We also brought a microwave popcorn kettle for fresh popcorn which was an awesome addition to our weekend. My husband and I always bring our own pillows and blanket on trips but Julie’s bedding was very nice. Our blanket came in handy to put between our bodies and the mattress as there was a plastic cover beneath the fitted sheet that made for some really sweaty sleep the first night. After we put our blanket down under us, we were incredibly comfortable."

Stayed about a week","My first Airbnb during the coronavirus pandemic, and I felt some trepidation at traveling, but Julie has made her place feel very safe. Contact-free check-in, everything spotless, and plentiful disinfectants / cleaners for guests' use. WiFi is solid — 100 Mbps; the router is in the bedroom and not shared with anyone else. Washer+dryer was nice to have; small but they work great.
It's the little things that really get me sometimes. I like being able to see where all my stuff is (without having to learn/remember which drawer I put what) and not be all over the floor, for which wall/door hooks are invaluable. Well, Julie's place has hooks. So many hooks. (And drawers, if you're into that.) Love it :)
The kitchen is very well-furnished, and again, the little things add up: sharp knives, unscratched non-stick pans, good towels, plenty of utensils, multiple coffee-making options, lots of counter space, and a useful swath of basic cooking staples."

Stayed a few nights","Julie is a very gracious hostess. She was always quick to respond to questions or requests. I am particularly grateful for her coming out in the cold rain to bring me a hairdryer one morning, and rescue me one night when I had trouble getting the unit unlocked. Do be aware the unit is accessed through a tricky little alley and up a steep flight of stairs that can be tough to navigate in the dark, in poor weather and/or with suitcases. I would recommend bringing a flashlight if coming and going in the dark. Her place is in a quiet local neighborhood with easy access to the Commons and Cornell, so a convenient place to crash if you're in town visiting campus."

Stayed a few nights","The location was great and the house was mostly as described but definitely not as nice as it looked in the photos. They don't show a picture of the shower downstairs, which seems deliberate, b/c the shower walls were yellowed.
The kitchen was well-stocked, but the nonstick cookware was quite scratched up and the dish scrub looked quite worn.
Additionally, they locked the thermostat--I was unable to keep it at 72 degrees consistently without having to message them. They were also slow to respond--it took over five hours for the host to respond. They turned it up to 72 degrees but did not give me the passcode, which felt weird to me.
The upstairs bedroom with the blue floors looked aesthetic but was poorly insulated and furnished. The pillows were flat, the only blankets were thin quilts despite it being winter, and I could hear the street noise. It was also significantly colder than carpeted bedroom.
Overall, this was a decent stay, but I definitely expected more for the price."

Unrelated to anything to do with the apartment/host, we would probably wait to stay again as we have very young children and it is not the most toddler friendly apartment.

Overall, super budget-friendly option for taking advantage of all Ithaca has to offer. David and George were very responsive!"

The house had everything we needed and was very spacious, comfortable and nicely furnished. David had lots of local guides and recommendations, and even an office room that was not in the pictures! Check in, check out and communications were very smooth. I’ve already recommended the place to classmates for future campus visits!"

Stayed one night","Had a great one-night stay at David's place. My brother and I went to an event at nearby Cornell University. It was my brother's first time in an Airbnb and I told him that this place is a ""perfect"" example of one, where everything is as expected.
It was clean and comfortable, and all the amenities we needed, like towels and bedding, were amply supplied. The apartment was decorated but no clutter which was nice. The bedrooms were spacious, my preferred temperature and dark It was easy to get into and find. David was communicative and clear about details, including parking (we parked on the street instead of in the space based on his information). We got some great breakfast place recommendations. And, the chocolates were a nice touch.
We felt at home!
One note for future guests is that the stairs going up to the bedrooms are steep. It was no problem at all for us (we are both in our late 50s) but might be a consideration for other.s

Stayed a few nights","Rented for my thirtieth birthday. Wasn't bad, but first night we received a noise complaint while playing board games, so that was surprising. Everyone was very cold Friday night, and we were unable to turn up the thermostat as it was locked. George came to the unit Saturday afternoon to fix the thermostat. I asked if there were more paper towels, and they were locked up. George made a comment about it smelling like bacon and reminded us to use the fan when cooking. We did use the fan, and I felt like he was looking around checking up on us instead of letting us relax. He left and then came back a second time to mess with the thermostat again. I've stayed in many air bnbs and have never had a host interrupt our stay, have so many rules, or bother us the way we were on this trip. This aside, it is a good location and okay house, but the owners should work on releasing control and being a little more accommodating to guests."

The kitchen was very large and he had all the makings for coffee with explicit details on how to use his coffee machine. He had spices and condiments that made my life so much easier. The beds were comfortable and the bedrooms were very spacious which was a plus. I never felt crammed being there. He had all the extras you could imagine….tissues, paper towels, laundry items, beautiful towels, hand towels, shampoo, conditioner, books to read, games to play etc. there are too many to list. The place is definitely walkable to the Commons but it happened to be cold and snowy so we stayed in one night and cooked and ate at the Ale House the other night which was good as well. I really have no complaints. If my daughter decides on Ithaca College then I will definitely stay there again for sure."

I was able to cook lunch for the Cornell football offensive line with ease and entertain them in the lovely kitchen dining area. The outside seating was perfect for coffee/happy hour. The extra sitting room was perfect when my husband needed to work, thanks to the nice desk setup. Our family of 5 was able to meet up each afternoon (only 4 of us slept there) in the living room to watch football on the huge TV. Such a comfortable couch and chairs!

For example, the TV is very nice vs budget models that we've seen too often elsewhere. There is great lighting throughout. The street is very quiet. Easy walking distance to many places, and a short drive from everything. We traveled with our two young daughters and walked to the local library almost every day which had an amazing kids section. And George is a great host: responsive and helpful. We can't wait to visit Ithaca again, and hope David's place is available!"

Stayed a few nights","First off, I'm an anxious person who worries about the small things... David/George was right there guiding me through every step of the check-in process. I had sent George a message regarding things to see and places to eat... All incredible suggestions. The location of the house couldn't be better! Everything was a 2-3min drive. Yes, we drove because walking in 98 degrees in July isn't fun. Wegman's grocery store is open late; we were able to pick up snacks before our waterfall chasing hikes. It's probably the best grocery store I've ever been to!
The beds were marvelous (memory foam!!!) and the AC Unit saved us from sweating to death. Every single detail of this home was perfect for us. 2 bathrooms weren't needed, but it sure was convenient when we had to rush to use it from a 3 hour long hike! There are guidebooks, tour pamphlets and their own AirBnB guide. I never felt anxious or uneasy staying here. We were able to relax and enjoy ourselves on the couch to watch some Netflix and make an espresso in the morning.
I would love to stay here again! Thanks for everything!"

Stayed a few nights","Overall I had a great experience everything worked out quite fine. So thank you very much! However, two things were bothering me: one communication about check in was too slow, you should have let me know right away that you have special timeline for check in info. Most super hosts give you details at least one day in advance, I got it 4 hours prior to check in (it’s a good thing I had connection on my phone while hiking).
Second more minor thing was your headline doesn’t match the actual space “designer apartment” it is not. That brown carpet and linoleum floors are more in line with motel aesthetic."

Stayed a few nights","David's home is super cute and homey. The location is perfect—just 4 minutes from Ithaca bakery and a quick walk to Hawi Ethiopian (two of our favorite stops in Ithaca). No one else was in the attached in-law suite when we stayed, so it was super quiet, private, and enjoyable. I especially appreciated the design of the front bedroom upstairs. It felt like a creative space, so I worked from bed instead of on the desk. However, there is a lovely desk and reading nook at the bottom of the staircase that my husband enjoyed.
We stayed on a pretty cold night and were warm and toasty. We've stayed in plenty of older homes that tend to be drafty, but this place is well insulated, and everything is functioning just as it should. David even changed the thermostat cap remotely at my request to make sure we were comfortable. I appreciated his responsiveness from the booking through to checkout.
Extra perk: I loved that this home was super clean yet didn't smell of cleaning solution or fragrances. Sometimes Airbnbs use a lot of Febreeze, plug-in air fresheners, or scented detergents. I'm really sensitive to these things, so it can make a stay unpleasant. But David's place was perfect for anyone like me with allergies and sensitivities!
Note on parking: I was a little concerned when I heard about the driveway being challenging to get in/out of since we had two cars with us, but we found street parking directly in front of the home, so that wasn't an issue.
Thank you so much, David! We'll definitely stay again the next time we're in town."

I'd highly recommend David's place!
As a side note, unrelated to these accommodations, if you are travelling to Ithaca any time soon, be prepared for long waits and early closures at local eateries. This once bustling downtown had noticeably fewer dining options and was shuttered by 4 p.m. on Labor Day so plan ahead!"

There were spiders and big ants everywhere and some bugs that were flying around. Could not find any holes or cracks which made us a little more anxious. The house was very clean and well kept which made it more confusing. Thankfully no bugs that could cause harm in any of the furnitures. David was a great host and came to help right away by cleaning the whole house and even offering a service to come check the house regarding the bugs. He was a great help and I appreciate everything he did for us."

The hosts are very friendly and came to the rescue with a brand-new flashlight and extra candles when a citywide power outage hit following storms. You’ll find yourself mere blocks from a range of good restaurants (be sure to check out the Rook, which is a real gem away from Ithaca Commons). We will watch for availability here on future Ithaca trips."

We acclimated quickly and felt at home during our stay.
As an important note, I was quite pleased with the shower pressure as many AirBnBs in the Ithaca area we stayed at previously did not have shower pressure anywhere near as good as Zac and Isabel's AirBnB."

Stayed a few nights","Isabel and Zac’s home was beautiful and we really enjoyed our stay. It is closed to everything. Was able to walk up the hill to Cornell and the Ithaca Commons is only a few blocks away. Also near a bus stop which can take you to/from airport which is more reliable than Uber/lyft which can be difficult to find sometimes.
The loft is beautiful and great for working. If you use as a bedroom you must bring an eye mask for sleeping as there is an uncovered skylight and light pours in early. They were kind enough to leave some snacks, OJ, coffee, tea and oat nut creamer along with eggs and pancakes. I thought that was a really warm and welcoming touch. It was bit hot upstairs in the loft and hard to regulate the heat but that may have been user error. They ask you to strip the sheets and take out the trash which was fine but I’d never been asked to do that by a host before.
Overall a really great stay and we would define you stay there again when in Ithaca."

Stayed a few nights",Isabel and Zac always responded to my messages quickly. On our drive to Ithaca my husband developed a migraine and we were to arrive 4 hours before check in. I messaged and explained our situation. They contacted the cleaning company and we were able to get in 2 hours early … the blinds drawn in the bedroom and ready for him to lie down. The home was bright and cheery with fresh flowers and welcoming treats. We truly enjoyed our time here. We were able to walk to the falls to hike and also walked down town for food. We met Zac and he was extremely kind and friendly. 10/10 would recommend.

Stayed a few nights",We loved our stay in Ithaca. The carriage house was great and close to everything in downtown Ithaca. Very clean and many amenities and personal touches. We loved the book in one of the shelves that showed step by step how the house was built by them. I would definitely recommend stay at their place. Had a great time and wish we had stayed longer to be able to drive around Seneca Lake. We did drive around Cayuga lake and saw many of the incredible waterfalls within minutes of the house. Visited some ciders and wineries. So many to choose from. Great place!

From the towels to the blanket-throws, the décor was inviting and cozy. Ithaca Commons was a couple blocks away. We had to rent a car and parking was easy. Isabel and Zac left instructions and recommendations. Great place---just as pictured. This will be our go-to in Ithaca, for sure!"

Stayed a few nights","Very nice apartment. Great amenities. Quality appliances, etc. Good shower. Well stocked. Warm, comfortable bed. Good location.
One note, there are no shades on the 3 main windows. As you can see by the photos, it's one big living space so not having any shades creates a privacy issue.
Communication was good up until several days before arrival. They were traveling at the time, but it would be helpful to have some back-up in place for when they are away. Communication was good otherwise.
Overall, it's a very nice comfortable apartment in good proximity to the Ithaca Commons, restaurants, waterfalls, hiking, and both Seneca and Cayuga Lakes for visiting wineries.
Highly recommend."

Isabel was very responsive and even provided us with a drip coffee maker and coffee quickly when asked if one was available. We had originally booked for an earlier date and had to change the reservation last-minute, which they were very understanding about and graciously accommodated. If in Ithaca again, we would consider staying in the carriage house."

Stayed a few nights","As a Cornell graduate, I've been traveling to Ithaca for the last 30 years. This is by far one of the best locations for easy access to campus, but also to all of the town's amenities. It's 3 or 4 blocks away from Ithaca Commons (the downtown pedestrian shopping district), making it extremely walkable, yet located on a quiet street. The description of this listing is spot on. The pictures are very accurate. What stood out for me was the amazing attention to detail in terms of cleanliness... like seriously, you guys, this place was clean, and I'm an insane neat freak. Final bonus: there's a Nespresso (so clean I actually used it and I NEVER feel comfortable enough to use the coffee machine in a rental!). Really one of the best airbnb stays I've ever experienced."

Stayed a few nights","Our son was getting married in Ithaca on Oct. 1st and we needed a large house to rent for 6 days to host our immediate family on both sides. We ended up renting the Chic Mansion AND the Carriage House. Can not even begin to say enough about how great our stay was. Both places are beautiful, clean, extremely cozy and in a GREAT location - walkable to the Commons, breweries, restaurants and even hiking trails. We had 9 people just in the Chic Mansion and we still had plenty of room and privacy for everyone. It was also a great gathering place for other friends and family who attended the wedding. Isabel was very responsive to all of our questions and made sure our stay was as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. I would HIGHLY recommend renting either place (or both!). Do not think you will find a better location or better accommodations in Ithaca. Thank you Isabel & Zac!"

My wife and I very much enjoyed our stay while visiting our son in college. It was a quick drive to the Cornell and Ithaca College campuses, and centrally located for everything else Ithaca has to offer.
The high ceilings provide a light, airy feeling and high windows bring in plenty of natural light. The decor is spot on with a comfortable, yet appropriately impersonal feel. That said, the few knick knacks and books were interesting and added to the experience.
Everything was spotless and clean, and the kitchen was fully stocked with cooking equipment, pots, pans, knives, etc.
Check in was a breeze, and parking was just outside front door.

After that first night, were able to park in the driveway. Other than these glitches, a very nice stay.

Despite this missing hot water (freezing in the shower) situation, this Airbnb will definitely be our top choice in Ithaca and we would love to return to stay here! My girlfriend and I work in NYC and this Airbnb is just the perfect getaway. So conveniently located, cozy, and beautifully designed."

The Carriage House itself is comfortable, completely private, equipped with everything our family needed, and so pretty and serene. This is a perfect spot for exploring Ithaca. It would be a delightful spot for a solo writing or relaxation retreat, but we were there with our two kids, and it was a perfect fit for all four of us!"

I would live to stay there every time we visit Uthaca, but unfortunately because if all there good reviews, unfortunately for us they are already booked up for our next visit.

My mother and I stayed 2 nights and appreciated being able to easily walk all over town from the guest house. Isabel & Zac thought of everything here to make for a comfortable stay (as an Airbnb host myself, I'm taking away a few ideas :). The beds were exceptionally comfortable (haven't slept that well in weeks!) and the setting is very peaceful. Sparkling clean, full kitchen and convenient coffee pods, little games and great books. Can't wait to visit again!"

My best friend and I enjoyed short drives (20 minutes and 30 minutes) to hike Lucifer Falls and wine tasting right on Lake Cayuga at the Twisted Owl Winery. Every place else in town, we walked! It's so close to great restaurants, local bars and shops. If you're a record collector, make sure you check out Angry Mom Records in the basement of the local used bookstore.
We seriously couldn't have asked a more beautiful space in a more perfect location. This is a must stay place if you are visiting Ithaca :)"

The layout was airy and spacious enough for us to host a small dinner party. Plenty of towels, soaps, lotions, cookbooks, card games and other amenities. We will definitely stay here again."

The fact that we could park right outside our door in the driveway was an added bonus. The hosts were very accommodating and not only gave us a necessary early check-in, but left us some delicious snacks. We will definitely be staying here again every time we come to Ithaca!

Stayed with kids","Location is excellent. About a 7-minute walk to Downtown Commons. You'll spend more time driving there and trying to find a place to park than just walking. Isabel and Zac went out of their way to make us welcome; I mentioned that we were bringing our two young children (ages 7 and 10) and our hosts went out and purchased new toys and games for them to enjoy during our stay. Do the big stuff like hiking Buttermilk and Taughannock and Treman parks and going to the Sciencenter, but also enjoy some simple pleasures like the Alex Haley community pool (a 15-minute walk), the public library (4-minute walk), and the sprayground in Stewark Park. The space was comfortable with lots of thoughtful details (condiments, laundry detergent, a fan for the bedroom, multiple snacks at check in, etc. The layout of the ""living room"" is a little cramped; we weren't really able to cozy up on the couch and watch TV at the end of the day, but no big deal. Wifi was a bit spotty as well. Otherwise, our kids declared it one of their favorite spots of all our family vacations."

I had messaged them prior to booking, and asked questions about the location in relation to places I wanted to see while there. They answered very quickly and with detailed descriptions of walking distances as well as the conditions of the routes. I had hoped to walk to the Cornell botanical gardens, and they let me know it was walkable, but uphill all the way, so I was well prepared! They also recommended restaurants with vegan options (Lev Kitchen is excellent) and because I wanted to try the local cideries, they had great suggestions for those. The apartment was so clean and welcoming, very well stocked and organized and with detailed instructions for everything. And a claw foot tub! 🛁 The neighborhood is lovely for walking, and close to Ithaca falls. The bed is very comfortable and the linens are fresh and clean.

Few minutes drive away from Cornell University, and a 10-15 walk to main shopping street (which was a bit less lively than we had expected - in November).

Stayed a few nights","Cute place although the second floor attic rooms have less light because of the small windows. It was darker throughout the day than I would have liked, but that’s just the house/space itself. The lack of doors separating the spaces also made it challenging to both be working remotely and taking meetings. You can definitely hear people talking in the downstairs space and the dog next door barks quite a bit. We were mostly comfortable throughout the stay, but maybe not the best space for remote work, however."

There isn’t a fenced in area, but there is a small area in back to take your furry friend out for a quick break. (P.s. my wife and I wanted to get out our gardening tools and make the backyard a cool little hang spot - so much potential! :)
Thanks for a great stay! I definitely recommend it!"

Stayed over a week","It is a pleasure to look back on our month long stay at this AirBnB.
It was a real ""home away from home"" and hits the high marks for all categories.
Communication: Excellent via the AirBnB platform before and during our stay. Jia was on site weekly (and lives nearby) to take care of the physical property and prepare the downstairs unit for short term guests.
Location: Perfect! Close to Ithaca Falls, downtown, (The Commons, Dewitt Park Collegetown bagels:), Stewart Park, Farmer's Market , Cascadilla Gorge and Cornell.
Amenities: Remodeled kitchen which was well appointed (and marked for easy to find locations), fun clawfoot bathtub, good hot water/shower, and comfortable bed. We had a friend stay overnight on the pull out couch and she reported it as being spacious and comfortable. The hosts provided plenty of sheets, bedding, towels, etc. for the unit. We suggest you bring your own towels if you go swimming in lakes & gorges, as the towels are white.
We were able to access the on site laundry room since we stayed a month. That was a real plus too.
It was a pleasure to meet Jia and some of the other guests and neighbors. The neighborhood felt very safe.
We had a great stay and would recommend this oasis in Fall Creek to other Ithaca travelers without hesitation.
Thank you Jia and Katherine. See you next year!"

The apartment was comfortable and nicely decorated. The kitchen was labeled and well equipped. There is a clipboard and binder with lots of helpful information. I communicated with the hosts about restaurants and they responded quickly and were helpful. The apartment is within close walking distance of a few restaurants but also downtown is walkable. Would recommend a stay there.

Stayed over a week","This is everything you could want out of an AirBnB. My girlfriend and I stayed at Katherine and Gia's apartment for 5 weeks. Two of them, we were quarantined for two weeks due to NY travel restrictions and were not allowed to leave the property. For the two of us, the space had ample room, work spaces, and a spacious kitchen. The apartment was extremely clean. The kitchen was labeled and had plenty of tools to cook and bake to our hearts content.
The pictures don't do a great job of showing off the living room which has a comfortable couch and coffee table. Overall, apartment was a bit more spacious than we expected and extremely comfortable.
Downtown is about a 10-15 minute walk away and you're very close to other attractions like Ithaca Falls, the Cascadilla Gorge Trail, and Cornell University. The town is extremely cute and filled with shops and restaurants. The farmers market is a must if you visit.
Only thing to know is that the only doors are in on bathroom and the door to the apartment so don't expect a ton of privacy from your traveling companions.

I highly recommend staying here. The hosts are responsive and friendly and the apartment is wonderful, and the town is worth visiting."

Our only small complaint was that the water didn't taste good, but this is just a personal preference and something that the owners have no control over - we just bought bottled water. I would HIGHLY recommend this stay to anyone, and I hope we get to go back someday!"

Stayed a few nights","Great little place with everything you need for a weekend away. Very clean, quiet and comfortable. The small touch of fresh flowers was so inviting. The location was great. Close to everything. Enjoy your morning coffee with a view. Hikers, this is a short walk to Potter’s Falls on 6 mile creek. The hosts were very accommodating and communicative. I would definitely s￼tay again."

The space was immaculate and seemed recently renovated. Great shower, great bed, great cozy space for one or two. Nice view from the back window while we had breakfast. Downtown was just a few minutes walk and the spot served as a great home base while we explored the area’s beautiful gorges and waterfalls. Would highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","Cute, clean, and spotlessly maintained apartment in a quiet, peaceful neighborhood. I didn't have a chance to use the fire pit, but really enjoyed the fall colors from the private balcony overlooking Six Mile Creek. Conveniently situated to access Cornell, Ithaca College, and downtown Ithaca by car, bike, or walking. Tim was extremely responsive and left clear instructions that ensured our checkin and checkout were easy and unambiguous while also providing local recommendations. I would love to stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","We LOVED this Airbnb! This is everything we hoped for and more. It was cute, clean, and cozy. The bed was very comfortable, and the shower had great water pressure. For a little studio, it had a great sized bathroom. Absolutely STUNNING views out the windows of trees and the gorge. We didn't get a chance to use the communal space downstairs, but we hope to next time. We will 100% be staying here again — thank you, Tim!"

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at this studio on the gorge was amazing! The interior of the studio was decorated wonderfully, spotless, and had every amenity you could expect of a studio apartment. The view off of the deck was wonderful and waking up to the lush trees right outside our window was amazing. The apartment felt like it was situated in the middle of the woods, yet it was a quick 10 minute walk from so many restaurants, shops, and more! Tim was wonderfully responsive and had amazing recommendations. We will definitely be returning and certainly recommend this stay!"

Note: there is no air conditioning here and I'm not sure it would have been comfortable if it were any hotter, but it was a memorable stay and we hope to come back!"

Stayed a few nights","really nice space that's a short walk or super quick drive from the Ithaca Commons, so we had lots of restaurant options, and then a convenient drive to state parks, breweries/wineries, lakes, etc, which is why we stayed here! there is no A/C and it was a bit hot during the day, but we kept the sliding door open which cooled off the place really nicely, and was so peaceful with the river below! I loved sitting on the balcony with the trees surrounding me, it was a great escape from the city. and Tim had a really detailed list of recommendations which I appreciated :)"

Stayed a few nights","The studio is beautifully designed and maintained. It's in a truly lovely spot that makes you feel like you're in a treehouse. Waking up to all that green was delightful and with the state of the art bathroom, comfortable bed and kitchenette, you really do have everything you need. The location is great: about a walkable mile (5 minute drive) to the Ithaca Commons where there are bars, restaurants and shops galore to stroll around and soak up the positive Ithaca vibes. The communication was Tim was great. The space is quite small and is in the back of a house that has other apartments in it; if you're looking for more privacy, this may not be the right Airbnb, but we felt we got an authentic feel for life in this lovely college town."

I left the sliding door open with the screen and listened to the water rushing below. Loved it- thanks Tim!
