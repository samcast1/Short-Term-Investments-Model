Stayed a few nights","Stayed at the apartment for two days while helping my daughter who is in college move out of her dorm. The location is perfect. Many restaurants within walking distance. Off street parking was ideal. And the overall layout of the apartment was wonderful. The second story loft was very cute. And when I return in the fall, I will definitely be staying there once again.
Photos are accurate and the apartment was spotless.
The perfect place to stay."

Stayed a few nights","Jennifer's Loft was perfect for our needs. (We had 3 people, but 4 would have been comfortable, too.) The loft was exactly as described. While we had a car, we literally walked everywhere. On top of being a great location, Jennifer's place was clean, cute, and comfortable. We didn't cook while we stayed, but we easily could have. If our daughter commits to Brown, then Jennifer's Loft may become our new home-away-from-home for the next 4 years. :) Thanks for a great stay!"

Stayed one night","The loft apartment was spacious, immaculately clean and had what we needed in the kitchen to make this stay easy and enjoyable. Walkable to a couple cute areas with restaurants and shops. Safe area, quiet except it’s near Brown campus and on a Saturday night ear plugs will help with an uninterrupted night’s sleep in the loft bedroom as there was sporadic some noise on the street. No issues at all with noise in the bedroom! Jennifer was proactive with communication, highly responsive and made things easy. Highly recommend!"

Stayed one night","Recently stayed overnight at the Loft and it was amazing. My wife and a second couple enjoyed our stay as if felt like home. The Loft is well designed and welcoming. Nothing regarding this Loft apartment was disappointing. It is located within walking distance from a very active and lovely restaurant/shopping district; which im sure during warm weather it's the place to be! We would definitely love to stay here again during the warmer seasons and enjoy more of what the area has to offer.
AMAZING STAY 🙏 ☆☆☆☆☆"

The neighborhood it is in is also really beautiful, peaceful, and walkable to Brown University and lots of restaurants. Jennifer was responsive and and helpful - and even kindly let us check out an hour later. Don't hesitate to book this place. I am definitely going to bookmark it as a future place to stay again!

Jennifer is an amazing host~welcoming, friendly and very easy to reach and communicate with regarding questions that came up. Jennifer's space is super clean, cozy and easy to settle into. The beds are comfortable and the space quiet~great for getting a good night's sleep after walking all around the city.
The sunlight that comes through the living room window in the morning is beautiful! The space is really cool~old building with gorgeous architectural features.
Updated bathroom, kitchen along with modern cooling and heating system for the space.
Jennifer had great restaurants and activities to recommend.
The Loft is walking distance to everything we wanted to see, explore and visit.
Awesome location!
We loved it!
We recommend Jennifer's place and will definitely book again for our next trip to Providence."

Stayed one night","Staying at Jennifer's loft was a very nice experience. She communicated well and was quick to respond to our questions. The entire place was very clean and smelled of bleach upon entry.
Although the description noted the ceiling was short, the Loft area was smaller than expected as the camera angles don't show well that you can't stand up in the space. Great for kids, maybe, but not the best for adults.
The location is beautiful and very easy to walk around or grab an uber to another area. We were happy to have off-street parking for the night, too.
All in all, it served our purposes well, and we enjoyed our stay."

Stayed here for my son to attend accepted students day at Brown University, and the apartment was very walkable to Brown and all the action on Thayer St. The apartment has cool views of the tennis and ball fields across the street. There was also a perfect little desk overlooking a scenic street, where I was able to work, and the WiFi was great so I could host a 2-hour Zoom meeting with a cool view of that spiral staircase behind me). Note: there are several stairs to the apartment (which I appreciated for the forced exercise lol), but it’s not for those with mobility problems. Can’t wait to stay here again over the next 4 years!"

Stayed a few nights","I stayed at the Nook for 5 nights, attending a conference at at RICC and RISD, so the location was convenient for me. Kevin was responsive and quick to answer my questions before and during my trip and greeted me in the morning to show me the way to the apartment. The small space is well utilized and organized, stocked with many basics in the kitchenette and bathroom- the only thing I needed and couldn’t find was a pair of scissors. It would be a cozy fit for two people, especially as the bed is only accessible from one side and the bathroom has a sliding door without a handle, or one I could find. I love the reading nook, fresh flowers and plants throughout that made it feel homey. As someone sensitive to noise and light a sleep mask, earplugs and a mini sound machine was helpful to block out street noise and the lights that are always on inside the Arcade. Other than a fire alarm my first day when I was trying to nap, my stay was pleasant and it felt like a tiny home away from home"

Place is very tidy with great wi-fi and HDMI cable in the most logic place possible. Location is perfect, walk distance from most of Brown's facilities, with lot's of good restaurants 2-5min from the arcade. Cons would be related to downtown area noises that woke me up at night, and unfortunately a lot of people in situation of street near Kennedy plaza. Kevin did mention this beforehand, and it is safe, but it is still somewhat bothersome. Overall the pros definitely surpassed the cons, I had very good memories from my week here and will never forget how that cozy little place made me feel at home while working from it."

Mostly quiet (nothing to be done about pedestrians on the street shouting, as in any city), but no noise from within the building itself. There are nice shops and places to eat right downstairs, as well as many good restaurants, bars, and shops within a few short blocks. The description and photos are accurate: this place is small. Don't get me wrong, it is a great home-base for a short stay in Providence, but it is a microapartment.

Pros:
- Phenomenal location.
- Easy access to train station, cafes, and restaurants.
- Located above several small cafes.
- Quiet ambiance for most of the day./not loud at night.
- Elevator access.
Cons:
- Matress is very firm and depending on preferences may be difficult to sleep on.
- No parking for building. There is a parking lot across the street that charges $22/day and is flexible (i.e., you can go in and out of garage and pay for the day). The garage only provides 2 day passes so you will need to renew the parking pass every 2 days. It would be more budget friendly to use public transportation than rent/bring a car."

The apartment is located just 8 minutes from the train station and within a few minutes to some of the best restaurants in town including the many located on the first floor of the Arcade. There is a nice communal lounge with laundry downstairs and great coffee place.
The apartment is located on a fairly quiet side street, but it’s possible to walk to the center of town with shops and more restaurants in less than 10 minutes. The iconic Superman Building towers the Arcade on Westminster Street and was truly cool to see in person. The architecture of the Arcade and surrounding buildings was a great experience.
I will be back."

I was extremely pleased with the cleanliness of the rental and the location to unwind with so many excellent bars and restaurants within walking distance.
Kevin was a fantastic host and explained everything I needed to know about the rental, the easiest way to get around the massive building, and emergency evacuation details.
I hope Kevin's rental is available the next time I travel to Rhode Island to cover the Providence Bruins as a media member.
I highly recommend staying here if you're traveling to this great area of New England.

Stayed over a week","Living in this cute, cozy micro-apartment in the unique, historic Arcade was like a fairy tale. Plus, it’s right in the center of Providence! Lot’s of shops, restaurants, and theaters nearby. It’s a tiny place, but it’s got everything you need (including a great library and plenty of storage space)! Kevin was a great host. Friendly and responsive. All-in-all a pleasant stay! My only complaint is that it can get noisy in the evenings (especially over the weekend) due to street noise and fridge sounds. Also, despite the blinds, there’s always a bit of light in the apartment at night. But this is something you have to expect, living in a small apartment in the center!"

Great communication, great location. Walkable neighborhood & easy walk to other desirable areas. Perfect spot for two of us for a few days, the good size apartment fridge & toaster oven helped keep expenditures down. We also appreciated the good size bathroom & little extras…fresh flowers, coffee, tea, etc. We felt very secure with key fob access, the building was quiet, this unit is on the top floor with no one above, and little shops on ground floor were closed early in the evening. We were able to avoid heavy parking fees with street parking in the evening & free Sunday parking. Great stay!"

Stayed over a week","What an amazing stay! I was in Providence for 2 weeks and Kevin’s place was perfect for me. Just enough space to feel at home and go to/from classes. Major win on location as it’s right in downtown, close to everything! I pretty much walked everywhere for the duration of my stay.
Kevin is super flexible and allowed me to check-in/ out according to my schedule. The place is super clean and comfortable and I love the extra touches like bud vases in the dining and bathroom areas. Kevin also provided a bag of coffee (with a French press) and brought me extra hangers.
Beyond the apartment itself, it was so convenient to go downstairs at the Arcade shops to get my hair done during the week. I also took a moment to check out the eclectic bookstore. If I had the opportunity, I would have tried one of the restaurants as well.
Highly recommend Kevin’s place"

Stayed a few nights","Great location without being in one of those large hotel conglomerates. Kevin has made a space that maybe just the same size (or smaller) feel perfect. The room has a way that makes you feel welcome but still has that comfort space when needed. The room has everything a person could need. It was great for 1 person would be ok for 2.
The location is quiet. For being in a ""mall"" I heard no one else. I had music playing that couldn't be heard outside the door and except NYE nothing too bad from outside the windows. When looking out the Windows it is primarily a parking lot which gives you space to see around you. You look at the buildings that make up the Providence skyline.
When you step out of the building you are in the heart of Providence. Steps away from plenty of places to eat, including the ones inside the place. Perfect for exploring the architecture of this great town. I felt safe walking everywhere I went.
Kevin's pregame help really helped make the important decisions but leave time to read a book in the nook especially page 85 in the architecture book."

The place was within walking distance of many awesome places. My room maybe got colder than the other rooms or our temperature preferences were just way different.

Stayed a few nights","This was perfect for what my partner and I needed. The room was large and spacious, the bed was comfy, and we loved the lighting. The parking was so easy, and this Airbnb was so centrally located in Federal Hill. If you are looking to get to college hill or downtown, you definitely need to drive, if you do not want to walk for more than 20 minutes. The only thing we can say is that the bathroom had a slightly bad smell to it— perhaps the shower curtain could be replaced. Other guests were respectful and we had a lovely stay."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I chose Anya's and Alex's place as our 3 nights stay in Providence and we don't regret it. The location was quite convenient. It takes 15 min walk to get to the bus stops to/from the airport, as well as the train station. *By the way, a little tip - if you want to get to Boston by MBTA train, it costs only $10 on the weekends and the rides are unlimited, means you can ride there and back as many times as you want*. Self check-in/check out were very smooth. The room itself was nice, well decorated and clean. My husband said the mattress was good (it matters to him). We lived on the 2nd floor and it was warm enough there (it matters to me). Common areas as kitchen and 2 bathrooms were always clean and well equipped. However, the bathroom on the 1st floor was a bit too cold for me (month of March). There were not many people living there at the same time, so it felt private. The street was quiet even on Friday and Saturday evening. Shortly say,I recommend this place!"

It deserves all the 5 stars because of these 5 criteria we think are important: great deal/price, good mattress, super location, clean, personal touches of the hosts. Anya and Alex really nailed it on those 5 criteria. After so many overpriced, not worth it Airbnb stays, we were happy some people do Airbnb the way it should be. Thanks a lot. We will definitely come back."

The location is great near the Italian neighbourhood (federal hill) but it’s very residential and you need to go downtown if you want some nightlife. It’s not too far with a car.
Overall great stay and the hosts are extra nice and quick to answer. Thank you!"

I felt absolutely secure leaving my laptop in the room, which was crucial. I am a photographer and making sure my equipment is safe is always a priority. Anya & Alex went above and beyond to make sure there would be no kinks in communication and even recommended several local places to eat. Next time I am in Providence for a show I will certainly go out of my way to try and book with Anya & Alex both."

Stayed one night","This was our first time staying in an Airbnb that is just a private room. But let me tell you, they did not disappoint! We felt so comfortable and safe at this place! I was a little concerned about the shared bathroom situation but everything was so clean. There are 3 bedrooms upstairs and 1 downstairs. We were lucky enough to have the upstairs to ourselves since the other 2 rooms weren’t rented out so that was nice. A group of girls rented the downstairs room so we had our own levels of the house to ourselves! Made it so much easier and covid free friendly! Every room has their own lock and key, Anya and Alex left plenty of notes around the house making our stay THAT MUCH EASIER! Federal hill is just walking distance to so many cute and unique bars with the best authentic Italian grocery stores. There’s plenty of parking available as well! I appreciate how well they paid attention to details with this Airbnb and we definitely plan to come back in the future. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE."

Stayed one night",This place was perfect and as described! Couldn’t beat the price! I was only in town for the night (less than 12 hrs) and just needed a place to rest my head. The room was super cozy and comfortable! The shared bathroom was never an issue and there was minimal noise throughout the house as it is shared with other guests. I liked that this room wasn’t facing the street so the noise wasn’t an issue for me. I did have a bit of a hard time with check in since I arrived past dark and felt unsure about the area. Anya answered my call quickly when I had a question and was super sweet and patient with me as I found the house. I was traveling by myself and wouldn’t recommend walking around at night by yourself but during the day the area was lovely and convenient to other places. I did feel safe in the house and it was super clean and beautifully decorated. Would stay here again! Thank you Anya and Alex!

Stayed a few nights","Loved our stay at Anya & Alex's place. I would highly recommend this place and come back again. Here is our nutshell:
Positives:
- Cleanliness. It was really well maintained, kudos to the cleaning staff.
- Coffee machine. I was working for 3 of the days and having a coffee machine at home was a lifesaver
- Wifi is ample quick
- Communication from the host
- Fantastic location
Bad:
There isn't really any but if I have to be nit-picky, I would say the squeaky noise wood makes when you walk. It is particularly noticeable in the upstair bedrooms (like the one we stayed)
Shared bathroom wasn't really a problem as there are 2 units in the house. This isn't necessarily a fancy BnB but they got all the basics right and that's what I look for when I travel."

Stayed one night","The room was within a house with a couple of other rooms being rented out and a shared kitchen. The whole place was gorgeous and extremely clean and organized. There was a coffee machine in the kitchen that I took full advantage of in the morning! The surrounding area probably isn’t somewhere I’d want to wonder around alone at night, but I would definitely stay here again."

The one drawback was the attention to cleanliness during a pandemic. The shared upstairs bathroom didn’t get cleaned until the last day we were there and all the rooms were booked at the same time making me feel a little worried about my exposure.
That being said, I found this little bnb super charming and had it not been for my concern over the pandemic, I think this type of boarding house is perfect for travelers like myself and would definitely stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","The location was fantastic in terms of being able to walk pretty much anywhere within 20 minutes. there were some outstanding food venues within a 5 to 10 minute walk and the convention center was about 15 minutes away. The apartment itself was simply decorated but had just about everything you could need. The one item I do wish it had was a washer dryer setup, but there was a laundromat within a 2-minute walk of the apartment. One thing to keep in mind is that it's a slightly older building so it's pretty easy to hear people walking around in the other apartments, especially at night when it's quiet. It wasn't a big deal and a noise maker is provided to help with the problem, but if it's something you're sensitive to then it might be a bigger deal. Overall I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","Was in a perfect location, close to College Hill, surrounded by things to do and places to eat. Place felt safe and very clean. Everything was set up for us. The building carries a lot of sound (Could hear every time someone used the stairs) but wasn’t much of a bother. Little pricey but is mainly reflected in the convenience of the area. Great host, and will definitely be my first pick when I come back to Providence."

Stayed one night","Jennifer’s place was beautiful and in pristine condition. I primarily chose it for the outdoor space, but it was too cold to spend quality time out there during our time there. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. While we didn’t cook, she did have plenty of items needed - pots, pans, dishes, drink ware, and silverware. She also had a coffee pot with coffee ready to go. (Dishwasher, too!)
We really also loved that there was a parking spot for our one vehicle. Jennifer was EXTREMELY clear in providing us directions to the lot and overall checkin.
Some things to keep in mind, depending on why you are visiting:
- it’s about a .4-.5 mile walk to Atwells, a great strip with wonderful restaurant
- you can’t have more than two people inside the apartment at any time - this turned out fine because we were able to meet with our friend for dinner instead, but keep that in mind.
- pick up some water, as the tap is unfiltered
- there’s an iron and bath towels
- the WFH room is huge!"

I wouldn't have minded the walk if it were not for it being in the middle of a snow storm! Obviously that is out of the owners control. Regardless the apartment itself was beautiful and I would certainly recommend it!"

I did not meet Alexey in person, but he was friendly and responsive electronically, and checkin was very straightforward. The location had good bus service via RIPTA and I was able to get to downtown (and to the Brown University campus) by Lyft in under 10 minutes. There were a couple adequate food and grocery options in a less than 10 minute walk that Alexey suggested, and his suggestions were on the mark.
The bathroom was shared with 2 other guest rooms but this was fine for my stay since the other guests were considerate.
And my stay was a great value. I would stay again."

Everything was clearly listed with the room numbers password and where items were in cabinets. Only thing not labeled was the fridge shelves like description said or I didn't see them because there was a bunch of food there that could have been from the other people. Kitchen was a little messy when I arrived but that was cleaned up once I returned. Like warned it can be noisy with traffic thru the street along with a lounge being down the street.

Stayed about a week",My stay here was 10/10. Everything from the room to the kitchen and bathroom were very clean and organized! I felt very safe in the building and the accommodations were above and beyond. If I need another airbnb I’ll be sure to look for another if Alexey’s rooms!!

Stayed one night","The airbnb looks exactly like in the pictures. It’s clean and the bed is so comfortable! It comes with little extras like a coffee machine, a shave and dental kit and snacks in the room!
Nevertheless, it was pretty noisy at night. Two men were yelling at each other on the street and a dog from a neighbor was barking until after 1am.
I would still recommend the place, for one night and for more than one night. It’s probably one of the cleanest and most comfortable airbnb’s I’ve stayed at so far. The little kitchenette is definitely a huge plus."

Stayed a few nights","Very comfortable stay, the bed literally feels like a cloud! I was so comfortable there that I extended my stay. Only downside is walls are super thin. Could hear upstairs neighbors (it was before quiet hours though so not a complaint just an observation) and people could hear me (watching Netflix on my phone) but everyone respected quiet hours. Loved that there were snacks in the bedroom, and the bathroom had shaving kits and dental hygiene kits. A really nice touch as those are things people tend to forget or lose during their travel."

Stayed a few nights","I stayed at Alexey's place for over two months, my stay was mainly from Monday to Friday I didn't stay over the weekends. Alexey gave me the same room every week. I noticed that anytime I went back to the room on Monday there was evidence that the room had been thoroughly clean with fresh supplies. Great job !
Another thing I have to mention is that I didn't find parking one night when I returned from work because another guest had taken two spots. I ended up parking on the street and the next morning there was parking violation ticket on my door. I brought this to Alexey's attention and he apologized and also took care of the ticket as well. I greatly appreciate this kind gesture. Thank you"

Stayed one night","Lovely place, very easy check-in -- there's a combination lock on the outer door and on the door to your room and everyone gets their own code for that visit. There's wifi, naturally, and it's a quiet neighborhood.
Be sure to read the listing carefully. There are several rooms listed here, one (some?) of which have off-street parking and some of which do not. There's no street parking or garages in the area, so if you don't get the off-street parking one(s) then you'll need to park a ways off and hike / Uber / mass transit in."

Stayed one night","Everything was as described:
-Good value for the room
-The sheets were crazy soft
-Had some pots, pans, etc. which was nice
-Building was clean
Random Comments:
-The building is next to a relatively noisy street, but Alexey provided earplugs though, so no big deal.
-The neighborhood isn't phenomenal, but having off-street driveway parking makes it not a big deal.
-Alexey didn't lie, the driveway is tight, so make sure your car is small otherwise you're parking on the street.
-Never met Alexey. Condo is ran like a hostel, which is no big deal if you're not interested in the host/guest experience. You just kind of show-up, go inside, go to your locked room."

It thankfully ended at 2 am and Saturday was 1/2 as loud as Friday.

The water pressure was good for the shower, and can get pretty hot - I do love taking shower with high water temperature and still I had to turn it down a bit- very good.

Large kitchen that was fully decked out- we didn’t need to use it this weekend, but would have had everything we’d need if we did.

Stayed a few nights","Nora's home was perfection for our trip and needs. It was a lovely, urban oasis that offered the walkability for coffee, restaurants/bars and groceries yet spacious and peaceful. It was easy to find & a seamless check in process as outlined clearly in her instructions. The surround streets are very cute with a variety of shops, bars & restaurants.
The apartment looks exactly like the photos and is impeccably well appointed, clean and thoughtful. I really appreciated the kitchen which was fully equipped with things like a rice cooker, measuring cups, good quality pots & pans for meals during our stay. There were ample plugs strategically placed throughout the home, well placed lighting, wifi, extra linens, cleaning supplies, stain remover near the washer/dryer unit, instructions throughout and even ear plugs (which we didn't need). Nora and her family thought of everything!
I'd stay here again in a heartbeat and highly reccomend her location to anyone visiting the Providence area."

Stayed a few nights","We stayed for almost a full week. Norah’s place was great. Exactly what we needed! Norah is super responsive too.
LOCATION: We wanted to be downtown near everything, it was a perfect location. Providence is super walkable and has tons of restaurants and cafes.
AMENITIES: The place had everything we needed; backup lines, a washer/dryer, kitchen necessities, etc. Bed was SO comfortable. I slept so well.
NOISE: The noise from downstairs is true— you can hear the deep bass from the music. It kept me up a little bit but my partner was fine. It helped to put in earplugs (provided) and turn on one of the box fans (also provided). Also, it only played on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday night. Every other night it was quiet.
* One downside is that right out the windows is a parking garage; so not much of a view. But other than that, exactly as described.
* I’d also recommend that they put some more “homey” touches on the place, like rugs, maybe some more art. It didn’t feel super cozy."

Stayed a few nights","Norah's place was excellent. It is very centrally located in downtown Providence and was an easy walk to a number of great restaurants, bars, and the train station. The apartment was clean and check-in was a breeze. It had everything we needed for our stay - utensils, towels (tons of extra), iron, and a great selection of coffee and tea. There were also a number of board games available and a large desk in the bedroom that would be a great work-from-home setup. We ended up leaving our car in the Biltmore garage for 2 days, which cost $70. A little pricier than I would have liked, but worth it for the convenience! We would definitely stay here again"

Bed was comfortable, WiFi was fast, and everything was lovely. Strongly recommend.). Sadly, an unfortunate event demanded their return home two days after their arrival, and upon my informing Norah of the early departure, she replied with a totally unanticipated gift: she refunded two nights of the booking. Familiar with the rental policy as I was, it hadn't entered my mind to ask whether she might consider any refund or credit; this was entirely her idea.

Free parking was possible (we got lucky with street parking that didn't have meters, and there are several streets that don't have signs), but otherwise there's a parking structure around the block and metered street parking everywhere. For laundry, there's an in-unit washer/dryer combo machine, but the dryer part wasn't the best. However, there is a laundry room (that uses quarters) on the same floor that is available 24hours -- worked well for us. Overall, would recommend Norah's home!"

The location is very convenient and centrally located. My only gripe is that a club or beer garden was directly underneath the apartment, and they played loud music until 2 a.m. each of the nights I stayed. The music was loud enough that I found it impossible to sleep until it was turned off for the night."

We had the unfortunate luck to be there on a Saturday when the bar downstairs was having live outdoor music til 2am, but the Friday night was quiet so clearly not an every day event. We luckily had a sound machine for our baby to partially drown it out. Despite that, we had a lovely stay and would recommend this place, especially if you are not early birds like us and would be down at the bar enjoying the music anyway."

She brought 3 of her friends to stay over and get relief from their stifling dorms. They were in heaven in Aref's air-conditioned unit. It is so well appointed, sparkling clean and comfortable, way beyond expectations. Very convenient off street parking spot. I really enjoyed walking on the street and felt very safe, local architecture was stunning. Excellent Pizzeria was about a 2 minute walk, liquor store about 5 minute walk. Such a great place to hangout, hope to stay again as my daughter has 4 more years in Providence."

Stayed one night","My family of four LOVED Aref's gorgeous apartment and wished we had booked a longer stay immediately. It was incredibly well appointed - a feast for the eyes with all of the stylish furnishings and beautiful details, including a bounty of fresh flowers on the table. The building itself is landmark worthy. And there was a parking spot for our rental car, too. The location is also wonderful - close to Brown, terrific restaurants, river walk, downtown, Capitol. Providence itself was lovely and a great food town. Come hungry and get a good workout so you can eat more! If you are vegan, Plant City is a dream of 4 major vegan restaurants, plus cafes, patios, also elegantly designed. Thank you, Aref, for your hospitality! Hope to be back soon♥️🙏♥️"

I note that there is a closet in the 2d bdrm, but none in the master, so we used the 2d bdrm closet for our clothing. We love the diversity as well as the strong Italian element in this wonderful area of Providence. Being able to walk to the fab restaurants and little shops in Atwells is a plus."

Stayed with kids","This 2 bedroom apartment was located in an historic building and included every amenity from wifi, smart tv, towels to a full kitchen (ice maker, stove microwave, dishwasher, toaster, dishes, and a stocked coffee maker). Parking was right behind the apartment and could be accessed from a back door which made unloading your vehicle about 10 steps away. Coffee shop was right across the street and had great coffee and sandwiches. There is a pizza place next store called hotline pizza, which only takes orders online at set up time slots (I highly recommend). Julians is a block away with a great breakfast and lunch special. Also, about 3 blocks behind the building is Atwells Ave. with about 20 different restaurants. In sum, great location, apartment, host and experience.
Thank you Aref"

Stayed about a week","Thé apartment was just as pictured! I’d say that the 2nd bedroom w loft might even be better than the master bedroom!!! My 15 yr old son liked the loft! A few missing items in kitchen for week-long stay but Aref was happy to take suggestions and was able to accommodate right away. Can’t beat location! Minutes walk away from convention centre (we walked it a few times daily!) and great restaurants- and surrounded by fantastic coffee shops & bakeries. Shopping mall attached to convention centre. Only problem was finding full fledged grocery store! Finally found « stop-&-shop ». Would recommend nice outdoor setup w BBQ, Adirondack chairs & closed fire pit. Would love to go back on a future trip!"

The instructions I received from Aref were timely, very clear; making finding the space, checking and checking out seamless. I never once had to contact him for help with anything. The space was perfect for us 5 girls to hang out, sleep and get ready in. We especially loved the elevated design of the space which made us feel like we were in such a luxe space (which was a bonus to a fun weekend). The location was perfect as well. It was literal walking distance to Atwell's street, which is the heart of Federal Hill and where we spent most of our time. It was great to be able to enjoy our night out and walk back safely to our rental, and continue to enjoy the space after hours. I definetly would book again the next time I'm in Providence!"

Stayed one night","The place was lovely and clean with a coffee shop right across the road. My only problem was that it was almost winter and the outside temperature went down to 32 at the night. I figured out how to turn the thermostat on, but maybe others may not. This heated up the main room very quickly and well. However, the bedrooms remained icy even though I found the floor vents. My friend ended up sleeping on the sofa in the front room to a) stay warm and b) get away from an extremely noisy and annoying generator or something right outside. I was annoyed by it as well but had brought earplugs. There was a vibration associated with whatever the thing was. I imagine that in the Spring and Summer, none of this would be a problem.
It's a really beautiful space and a fascinating walkable neighbourhood with terrific and interesting architectural bits and pieces on the houses. The Nitro coffee shop (and bicycle shop) is right across the road and everyone there was incredibly friendly"

The place is stunning, I want to give whoever designed this place a hug like it was too cute! The beds and couches were sooooo comfy. My friend even made a comment that whoever cleans that place needs a raise because everything she inspected from the bathroom towels to the cups in the kitchen was immaculate. There’s only 1 parking spot in the driveway but the extra cars parked on the street just fine, we didn’t get any tickets. I don’t think I have anything bad to say, the host was super helpful and friendly and the location was cute and quiet. I even met some of the neighbors and they were delightful too.

Stayed a few nights","YOU NEED TO STAY HERE. This is not our first time staying at one of Aref’s places and it definitely will not be the last. He has such a special talent of making his Airbnb’s feel like full houses! This place receives a 10 from aesthetic to functionality. My only wish is that we could’ve stayed longer. It can get a little cold in the bedroom if the doors are kept closed but it didn’t bother us much. The apartment accommodates one parking spot but there is free parking from 6pm - 8am on street. During day it’s 2 hour parking. 5 min drive to center of providence. 8 min to art district. 3 min walk to “little Italy” and 3 min walk to the best breakfast spot on the market, Julian’s. Planet fitness less than 5 min walk away. Restaurants all around. This is the place to be. **If you’re set on this apartment but the dates you want are booked, check out Aref’s other listings in the same building! They all share the same type of vibe so you won’t be disappointed.** Safe travels!"

The beds are extremely comfortable and we had everything we needed. The location was great! We were able to walk across the street for coffee and over to Federal Hill for great Italian food. Appreciated the designated parking space behind the building, although there was usually ample parking out front on the street as well. Loved the provided toiletries! We even came home and ordered the same hand soap after enjoying the scent during our stay. Highly recommend if you will be in Providence and are looking for a location in Federal Hill!"

It was a short night due to a delayed flight/late arrival, but thankfully the instructions were clear and self check-in was easy. Our room was comfortable, but there were a couple issues with the shared bathroom. The toilet was clogged, so we needed to plunge it in order to get it to flush, and the faucet fixture was loose. The bathroom just needs some attention. Still, we were able to sleep well, shower, and get out the door easily enough. The artwork in the house was beautiful."

It was never clear to me if there were other guests in the unit and no information along these lines was communicated. Someone showed up to do housekeeping well before checkout time."

They went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable during my stay. The house was exactly as it described in the listing! It was actually more beautiful in person; you just have to experience it for yourself! It has everything you may need for a comfortable stay. Washer/dryer, full kitchen and living area and a great bathroom with a SPA TUB that works amazing! The apartment feels like a large home even though it is an apartment. The attention to details in the design of the home are incredible! It is set up to make you feel right at ""home"".
Collin and Jen were beyond amazing and kind! Anything that was needed was done immediately! They respond quickly to your needs. I was able to experience a wonderful social event that was held and the apartment! Food, drinks and good vibes! There is beautiful art and photos all over the home! 10/10!"

Stayed one night","Loved the Airbnb. Was a beautiful, tranquil stay - room etc matched description and we didnt want for anything. Nice touches throughout - books in the room, lovely kitchen and sitting area, the tranquil green colors of the space which made the Airbnb experience a truly calming one. Colin is an exceptional host - thank you!"

Stayed a few nights","Stayed at Colin's place for 2 nights in Providence, apartment was kept very clean with many amenities. our room was on a shared floor with 2 other apartments. the room was a little dusty and needed updating, but otherwise serviceable. Bathroom is nice, but shared between all the guests and in need of a plumber to secure some of the fixtures. All in all not terrible for the price point for a couple of days if you can handle sacrificing a bit of privacy."

Colin was a fantastic host. He was friendly and easy to reach. Something I really appreciated when my bus got delayed and I had to check in later than expected.
The check in and check out processes were also very quick and easy which is always a perk.
I wasn’t looking for anything fancy, just a place to sleep between stops on my trip. I feel I got more than my money’s worth!"

Additionally, I had asked Colin in advance if an additional guest could join us, Colin agreed and made exceptions to the rules which I am so grateful for. This may not be the case for everyone so please inform your hosts in advance. Thank you Colin and Jeniffer, we hope to be your guests again."

Very secure and nearby to incredible restaurants and drinks with super easy (on a Saturday eve no less!) available street parking! Would stay again. Cool photos around the apartment too, Colin!"

My only complaint was that the photos showed a different room than what we stayed in. We ended up with a double bed when the listing indicated a queen bed. Also photos of place we booked it was obvious that it was not the same apartment we stayed in. since we were only staying 1 night, it was alright. if we were staying another night we might have complained- mostly about the smaller bed. Otherwise a nice place at a reasonable price. Clean and quiet."

Stayed a few nights","The places was clean and in a great location, easy to walk to many restaurants, a brewery, coffee shops, etc. The description is accurate. You will be sharing a bathroom, which was cleaned regularly. With only one bathroom per four or so guests, expect to wait to use it, especially in the mornings.
The one issue I had is that the walls/floors are very thin, and you can hear everything — people walking/talking in the hallway, going up/down the stairs, in the room above us, and in the commons area. I am light sleeper so it was difficult for me.
Otherwise , it was a great bargain in a great area."

At first, I was looking for somewhere that was more walkable to downtown Providence, but this location proved to be excellent. It's a 10 min walk to Atwells Ave which has plenty of restaurants, and a 5 min walk to some great bars (The Avery, Ogie's Trailer Park). You MUST try Tricycle Ice Cream which was also less than a 5 min walk from here!"

I took one star off for two kind of minor annoyances—first, there was no soap in the bathroom. Kind of gross, but we just washed our hands in the kitchen. Also the thermostat is kept in a lock box that guests don’t have access to. Our room (only our room for some reason—rest of the apartment was fine) was super hot. We didn’t notice this until like 11pm, when it felt inappropriate to text the host. So instead of asking to turn the heat down we closed the heat vent and opened windows. It was still hot but manageable. Overall good experience, would stay here again."

Stayed one night","Great place! Clean and very pleasant house. Nice friendly hosts! Located in the most interesting part of the city, walking distance from everything. Would definitely go back!"
