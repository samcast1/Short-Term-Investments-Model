Stayed a few nights","Jennifer was an extremely attentive host from the day I inquired about the property until the day I checked out. She allowed me to get an early check in which helped me out tremendously as I was coming into town for my son's wedding. I needed all the help I could get with accommodations and any extra time. The place was awesome, the beds were comfortable and I could not beat the location. I would definitely stay her again in the future."

Group trip","We had a great time staying at the Pink Pine with our friends! Two of our other friends rented the Pine Cottage, which is behind this rental, on the same property, and they loved their stay as well! The Pine Cottage is privately secluded from the main house, and we definitely would have still felt we had a private space, even if we hadn’t known the other renters. Everyone in our party loved the comfortable king beds. We wish all places would put king beds in every room! The kitchen is well stocked, and we did a lot of cooking in it and had everything we needed. The property was spotless inside and out, and the fire pit and gas grill on the patio were perfect. There is plenty of parking, and the neighborhood seems very safe and quiet, despite being so close to SFA. We had one small problem during our trip, but our wonderful host, Jennifer, got it taken care of right away. She responded quickly to everything and was great to work with. We can’t wait to stay again on our next trip!"

Stayed a few nights","Jennifer was very friendly and responsive to last minute questions. We came into town to celebrate the holiday with our college daughter who couldn’t get away from work. The home layout gave us exactly the space we needed to prepare a holiday feast, and it also provided a dining table that provided the seating space to all share our holiday meal together! The double ovens really helped quite a bit in trying to pull meals together. The bedroom layout was ideal for us, and the extra door between the bedrooms and the main space really allowed an extra layer of privacy for those wanting to go to bed early or sleep in a little later. There was only one little step to get onto the front porch, and our 79 year old guest was able to navigate onto the porch and throughout the space easily. We really enjoyed our time in this cute home. We plan to keep this space in mind when we come back!"

Group trip","I cannot begin to thank Jennifer enough. This weekend was difficult for my family. We were visiting Nacogdoches for my Aunt's funeral. Jennifer was very accommodating and understood our needs.
The Pink Pine was absolutely adorable. You are greeted by the pink door as you pull into the driveway. The covered parking gives you ample coverage should there be inclement weather. inside the beautiful decor was so inviting.
The kitchen was wonderful with bottled water available and a coffee bar with a wide selection of teas and coffees.
Now let’s talk about the bedrooms and bathrooms. All rooms were beautifully decorated with wonderful mattresses and bed linens. The bathrooms had fluffy/plush towels and plenty of them. There were even soft make up towels provided.
We didn’t have time to venture outside to enjoy the fire pit, and the grill. Next time we visit Nacogdoches we will certainly book The Punk Pine and sit around the pit.
Thank you Jennifer for going above and beyond."

Stayed a few nights","WOW!!! Our family spent an incredible few days at Georgina’s home. The photos don’t do it justice - this property is HUGE. The pool was stunning, kids loved playing some tennis and basketball on the courts The huge trees and greenery in the neighbourhood felt so peaceful. Squirrels everywhere! The beds were so comfy and we had heaps of space. It was truly so relaxing, a perfect way to end our Texas road trip. We really didn’t want to leave.
Georgina was a wonderful host, her communication and support during our stay was top notch. Thank you!!
We’ve visited many AirBnB’s over the years and this one is one of the best. It’s hard to believe you really get ALL those facilities for the price paid. If you’re considering booking this home, do it now, you won’t regret it.
If you’re in Nacogdoches on a Monday night we recommend Trivia night at Maklemores for a fun night."

Overall the house was very clean. The beds are very comfortable. All of my mother’s grandkids loved the pickleball/basketball court. The living room was great. The sectional sofa could accommodate a lot of people and was very comfortable. Our only regret is that it was too cold to use the pool. This home definitely ticked all the boxes and I highly recommend it.

Stayed with a pet","I can't find all the words to describe just how delightful this place is! Everything was so clean but the best part was the wonderful, crisp, clean bed sheets. And the oh so comfortable beds! The decor is simple & elegant. It's such a light & airy home. This place has so many windows! And a lovely patio area where you can enjoy your morning coffee or evening tea. A huge tv above the fireplace so we could watch a movie. You have almost everything you need here. Just add food & you are all set! The neighborhood is lovely & VERY quiet! We really enjoyed our walks (2xday). Be sure & read ALL the info about staying here & if you have a pet, know that they could very easily escape because there are areas in different places under the fence that are open. We will be saving this place & hope to return in the near future. Thank you Host/s for making this home so special with all the little touches you make!"

Stayed a few nights","Luis is very flexible with the accommodations and is a good communicator. There were 1 or 2 bugs inside upon arrival since it’s summer, but as soon as I cooled down the place, I didn’t see any anymore. Upstairs neighbor was quiet and not bothersome at all.
Parking was a breeze with a lot of street parking available if you don’t want to park on the grass/dirt.
The living room coffee table turns into a desk and was very useful since I still had to work remotely.
Everything else was great otherwise! Highly recommended if you’re planning to visit Nacogdoches!"

The amenities were exactly as mentioned/the place was well kept! The neighborhood was very quiet, but makes for a great “retreat” if that’s what you’re looking for.

This home was beautifully decorated, warm and inviting. We had room for everyone and the location, near SFA, was perfect. We had everything we needed to move in and ""live"" like we normally do... dishes, soap, shampoo, towels, comfy beds.. the works. Lovely deck out back that is nicely appointed and private. Entry to and exiting the property is simple and love not having to keep up with keys. Thanks a ton for having us again Marilyn!"

Stayed a few nights","My Mom and I visited Nacogdoches on the way back from a family reunion. Marilyn's cottage was centrally-located with easy access. The house was spacious, way more than needed for just the two of us. But we realized we could return with more friends for a ""real"" girls' trip. The furniture was very comfortable and the TV's (both the master bedroom and the living room) were set up to use easily. We were able to watch local channels as well as stream some of our shows on Netflix. The beds, linens and towels were all top quality. I loved the device charging station set up in the old phone nook in the house. The kitchen was also well-equipped with coffee, which is a bonus. There was a lovely backyard with lots of seating too, and a couple of nice neighbor's dogs to help us not miss our dogs at home so much. We easily accessed the azalea gardens on the campus less than a mile away. We hope to visit again soon!"

After their check out I got a call from Marilyn that she was unhappy with how they did not clean the house after they left. I let her know I informed her it was 6 men who generally used the house only sleep being that they were away for work. I know they didn’t wipe counters and sweep but did try to pick up as best as the could. My guys did leave accidentally taking two towel that were mixed in with their dirty clothes. I did offer Marilyn two separate times verbally and through text to reimburse her for them being that we were at fault. My guys have stayed several times in different airbnbs in different areas with no problem.

The house is about 8 minutes from the closest gas station convenience store and about 20 minutes from the closest real grocery store. This was a perfect, relaxing, quiet getaway for our family of 5. There is a public boat dock about 2 minutes from the house and we were able to tie our boat to the dock for the whole week. The owners were very communicative and helpful. We really enjoyed our week long stay and look forward to getting back soon."

Home is better than described, relaxing common area, kitchen has everything you need then some, decorated tastefully. Savannah & Paul left treats & wine for our New Year visit. Communication was outstanding they took the guest work out of everything.
Clean home with very comfortable beds-
The view was Breathtaking from every angle- Don’t think twice about staying here just do it, you won’t be disappointed-
We can’t say enough good things about this place- Amazing"

He was able to get set up on the wifi quickly and settle in for long business Zoom call. We are very appreciative of this:)

Angela is all about the experience and details from the breakfast ingredients provided, not a spec of dirt in the house, more kitchen utensils than my own home and the tastefully decorated house. She overcame my biggest pet peeve of these rentals which are dull knives in the kitchen. All sharp and in working order. This is not your typical rental where the owner fills it with second hand stuff or items from the attic. This belongs in a Parade of Homes! We will definitely be back."

Stayed a few nights","This is a large, one-bedroom cottage behind the main house, with a private entrance. It's off the street, so it's peacful and quiet. The main room includes a full kitchen and living room with sectional couch and a big screen tv. There's a small coffee table but no dining table or chairs. The bedroom is also large and spacious, but contains just a bed, nightstand, and full-length mirror, adjoining a large walk-in closet. The whole space is sparsley furnished, but clean and roomy. The bathroom has a nice walk-in shower with a built-in seat and safety bars, so it's accessible for older or disabled visitors. The neigborhood is quiet and residential, but close to the main street through Nacogdoches and near the university. It's a very pleasant place for one or two people or maybe a small family, if some don't mind sleeping on the couch or a blow-up mattress. Great place for a holiday visit to family."

She provided us with all the necessary information we needed well in advance of our arrival, including detailed directions to the house and any other important details we needed to know. When we arrived, we found that the house was stocked with everything we needed, from fresh linens and towels to all the cooking essentials we could ask for.
The home itself was a hidden gem - it was beautifully appointed, with plenty of space for our small family of three to relax. The attention to detail was impeccable, and the decor was stylish and comfortable. We truly felt at home during our stay.
If you're planning a trip to Nacogdoches, this home is a no-brainer. It's conveniently located, with easy access to all the best attractions in the area. But more than that, it's a space that truly feels like a home away from home.
Thanks again to Jennifer for providing us with such a beautiful stay! ❤️❤️❤️"

It was such a blessing for our family to come into town for graduation….and be able to gather all together at your lovely BNB! We visit Nac several times a year….wish we had known about this sooner….but now that we do, we will become a frequent guest! The accommodations were stellar…..you literally thought of everything….including coffee and creamer! The house was pristine….so fresh and inviting! The beds were some of the most comfortable we’ve experienced for a home away from home! Being so near the college, local restaurants and other points of interest in Nac…makes it ideal for most all events!
Thank you again…for welcoming us into your city…and into your amazing BNB!
Blessings…….until we see you again!
Jett & Lynette Major and family"

There were a lot of small things that were pleasantly surprising - the shower water got hot very quickly, all the appliances were surprisingly new - and my favorite: there was a coop of very curious chickens near the stairs to the entry way that were happy to greet me every morning. Definitely enjoyed staying here, I'll be looking to stay here again when I return to Nacogdoches."

Stayed a few nights","An easy walk to almost everything in historic downtown. With a secure coded door lock, and seamless check-in, this frame upstairs-garage-apartment is a quaint little abode that has everything you need for a stay in ‘Nac. Comfortable bed, closet, AC units in bedroom/LR, small but full kitchen (range, fancy coffee-stuff-we-don’t-know-about, a large Keurig, glassware, microwave, fridge, comfy living room furniture, and a smart TV) Make no mistake: the premises is rustic and authentic. The cabinets and bathtub are probably original to the structure and haven’t been HGTV’d to a bright shiny finish. The stairs are old and steep, there is paneling and leather furniture that is comfortably loved, but we think that’s part of the Airbnb kitsch and charm. We drank our coffee on the elevated deck at an iron patio set overlooking the historic old cemetery and walked to the city-center wineries and antique shops. If you require brand-new, flawless, shiny hotel style accommodations- maybe this is not your jam; but if comfy boho is appealing to you, you’ll enjoy this little gem close to everything in ‘Nac."

Stayed over a week","I stayed at Elena and Joey’s place for a month while visiting Nac to do my nurse anesthesia clinical rotation (TCU student) at the local hospital. The apartment was very cute, cozy, and comfortable, and it had everything I needed. It was only 5 mins from the hospital, which was helpful when I wanted to sleep in or was scheduled to take call and needed to arrive at the hospital quickly. The apartment is downtown and near lots of shops and all the restaurants. Elena and Joey were attentive and did everything possible to make sure I was comfortable during my stay. I happened to be there during Thanksgiving, and they were kind enough to invite me over to dinner with their family and friends. This meant a lot to me, as I was away from home (south Louisiana). The apartment was very quiet so I could focus on my studying during my last month of a demanding program with a hectic schedule. I enjoyed overlooking the cemetery on the balcony while studying or drinking coffee. I was pleasantly surprised that there was a Keurig in the kitchen! That was perfect! The bed and furnishings were super comfortable, as well. I was able to keep the indoor temperature regulated to my satisfaction. The apartment was decorated beautifully, and the hosts get 5 stars for that awesome renovation job. I enjoyed my time there; thank you again!!!"

This house has good vibes and belongs to good people who actually live on the property and have deep connection to and investment in their community. I had a stressful week of waiting to see what kind of havoc the storm would wreak and Joey and Elena kept an eye on me and basically they took good care of me in exactly the way I needed. The house felt like a safe haven and had everything I needed too, and the natural light in there is really nice. And yes definitely do get a coffee from Joey at La Biblioteca and take Pilates with Elena at Stretch ER. And explore the trail, which you can access through the cemetery! It was an ideal landing place for me during a difficult time. 10/10 would evacuate here again. Eternal gratitude to Elena and Joey."

So peaceful! So convenient too! We walked to Fredonia Steak house and had dinner one night and the next night we walked to the Fredonia Brew house for some tasty craft beers! We definitely recommend booking this cute little hideaway & will definitely book again instead of the boring hotels!!"

Also we were only left a partial roll of toliet paper and no extra. A manual for the house would have been helpful we were not for sure on Wi-Fi password and had no idea what the checkout procedures were . The chalkboard recommendations was a nice touch."

It's kind of a secret delight in the sense that when you first pull up and view it from the outside, you don't really realize how nice it is. Even when you first enter, you don't see the entire layout, but, once you are inside and enter the spacious living room/kitchen/dining room area, you realize that you are in a spacious and comfortable place that feels like a home away from home for the duration of your stay. You are also within walking distance of historic downtown Nacogdoches, and there are fun activities and places to eat within walking distance. Marylyn is also a very accessible and responsive host.

Stayed with kids","I've visited Nac 3 times to visit my son in school, staying at the Fredonia Hotel the first 2 trips. He just graduated, and this time... my last time, I wanted something different. I was also bringing his grandparents, so the tiny rooms at the best hotel in town would have been uncomfortable. Enter Airbnb, and I found Marilyn's place.
Let me echo other reviewers by saying the house is beautiful, roomy, well-equipped, and perfectly located. Let me further tell you that my retirement-age parents were so charmed with the accommodations and amazing value that they have now DITCHED their plans to buy an RV for their upcoming travels and decided Airbnb is the way to go!
Thank you Marilyn for providing such an awesome place to stay, and at a rate that is honestly unbelievable! When we first pulled up, I thought surely it must be only part of the home we would he occupying, the house and parking area being so large. We seriously could have fit 3 vehicles into the driveway. Not to mention 3 extra adults into comfy beds if needed!"

Stayed with kids","The Downtown Inn is a great option for travelers interested in visiting Nacogdoches, Texas. Marilyn has created a beautiful space, within a very unassuming exterior. You aren't sure what you are walking into, until you walk-in and are greeted with multiple rooms, filled with comfortable beds and plenty of sleeping options. We were so impressed by the home's spaciousness, cleanliness, and plentiful amenities (WiFi, TV with Roku connections, fully stocked kitchen, washer and dryer, etc.). The pictures posted really do not do the space justice.
The location is on the cusp of downtown, and is very convenient to downtown attractions. That said, there is a housing unit just behind the home that had people coming and going throughout the evening, sometimes with loud music. It was a bit concerning at times, so something to note.
Overall, I would recommend for a larger group, looking for an affordable, clean, and spacious option near downtown, knowing that you want to remain mindful of your surroundings. Thank you Marilyn for providing such a beautiful home."

Stayed a few nights","This is a huge space for the price--three bedrooms, large living room & dining area, full kitchen, laundry machines, and a small back patio with table & chairs, grill, and outdoor lighting. It was well-equipped with linens, soap, dishes, silverware, pots & pans, glassware, coffee, and some cooking basics. Everything was spotlessly clean and in working order. There was good wifi, cable television, & Netflix available, as well as games and books. There's even a crib in the master bedroom closet, if needed. The house is tastefully decorated and well-arranged for families or multiple occupants. It's walking distance to the small downtown area of Nacogdoches, which has restaurants and shops to enjoy, and a quick five minute drive to the SFA university campus. The neighborhood is an older historic neighborhood, and there's currently some construction along the street in front, including some large metal plates in the road that bang when cars go by--but this is likely temporary. Overall, it was a great place to stay and one that I'd gladly use again on future visits."

Stayed a few nights","We reserved Marilyn’s place for 4 female SFA alumni to meet up for the weekend. I wasn’t sure what to think when we pulled up because it doesn’t look like a traditional house from the outside but I was relieved when I stepped inside. There was driveway parking for 3 vehicles right outside the door & plenty of room on the street if you need it. You enter into the daybed room & walk through the double twin room before getting to the common areas. Every room was very clean & welcoming. We appreciated the thoughtful touches like makeup remover wipes & night lights. The linens were all soft & fresh. We ate meals out but the kitchen seemed well stocked. The coffee maker was a combo carafe & kcup brewer. There was ample room to have our own space & also spend time together reminiscing & laughing in the living room.
The location was perfect for shopping downtown, drinks at Fredonia & driving anywhere in town. Marilyn’s bungalow is a hidden gem & I would recommend it to anyone looking to visit Nacogdoches."

The king bed was super comfy and the living room was spacious with comfortable furniture. My mom couldn’t stop talking about how soft the chairs at the dining table were (we spent a lot of time there playing board games).
I loved all the great touches for kids! In addition to the crib, there were kids games and puzzles, and even a kids shampoo. My baby is too young for any of it, but I would recommend the spot to families for sure.
If we ever go back we would definitely stay there again. Thank you Marilyn!"

Kitchen well stocked with dishes, pots and pans and silverware. Plenty of nice big fluffy towels. Everything was very clean and truly comfortable. There was even a very nice small private patio. There is also a large washer and dryer if needed. Great place and would Stay there again. Oh yes only 1 block from historical downtown and lots of good fun an shopping."

The place is even walkable to a small shopping area: the University plaza. Kasey’s townhouse itself is clean, quiet and comfortable. The neighbors are all friendly. We would love to come back to Kasey’s place next year. Thank you for hosting us."

Bed I slept in was extremely comfortable with equally as comfy linens & bedding. Extras that were appreciated - plenty of towels in bathroom, great iron, luggage rack in master bedroom (probably sounds like a simple thing but I don’t like when I have to put my suitcase on the floor so having the hotel type rack was perfect!) Kitchen had all the cooking items (pots, utensils, dishes, etc.) needed to make my son’s favorite meal during my visit :) I would definitely stay here again. Kasey was super responsive & attentive, even touching base to ask if all was well & if we needed anything. A+ in my book!"

Stayed about a week","First. The chair. It looks harmless enough. It’s not. The chair is unusually lightweight. It is built of sticks and upholstered, but the stuffing is minimal. In fact, you may have stuffed more soft filler in a Build-a-Bear’s butt than was stuffed in this chair. This chair is so light, I don’t believe it actually touches the floor. If you decide to sit in this shapeshifter of average sittery, you must respect it. The sticks, glued together to give this thing it’s chair-like appearance, are sharp and placed exactly where you will likely expect soft stuffing. You won’t find it. I often have a hard time getting out of a chair. Not this one. I found myself plenty motivated to get out of this one. Getting into this thing is the hard part. You must sneak up on it. Whatever you do, don’t bump it. I did. It’s hoverboard qualities are unbelievable. One simple bump and I had to wait till morning and pack a lunch to go find it.
Everything else. Awesome. Super clean 2 bedroom, 2 bath, little dining room, pool, a nice tv, washer and dryer, and a porch on the front and back. The neighbors are friendly and quite. Kasey makes the entry, the stay and the check-out so easy. We were there a week and never had a problem, but Kasey made it clear that she would take care of things if needed. I would definitely go back."

She even let my daughter and her 5 day old son stay until I arrived when she got power back before they did. She kept my family warm! Her space has a mix of interesting personal and inspirational decor, and the supplies you need will be there. Towels, yep nice thick towels in the master!

Stayed with kids",This was our second stay here. Love the location! Went for a beautiful run in the park across the street and it was the perfect spot while we got our Freshman moved in at SFA. The beds in Kasey's place are sooooo comfortable - better than being at home! The place is very clean and quiet as advertised. The blackout curtains and comfy beds make it hard not to sleep in ;-)

It's got two big bedrooms and bathrooms, a small dining area and outside table, a big living room with good wi-fi and Netflix, industrial size washer and dryer, good AC, and a full kitchen. It's also on the ground floor with convenient parking so checking in and unloading the car are easy. There are lots of little personal touches that make it welcoming and homey. It's a great place for visiting family or friends, attending events in town, or work-trips where you need a place to rest or work. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone."

Stayed with kids","This place was a great little stay for our trip to Nacogdoches. Located right by the University and easy to get to food/gas/etc. The place was tidy and had everything we might have needed (i.e. towels, dishes, Netflix, etc.) It was as described on the Airbnb page.
Our only complaints are: 1) the WiFi code that is displayed in the living room is incorrect, and differs from what’s in the app/on the modem. It was an easy fix but was confusing at first. 2) there were some bugs in the kitchen. the area probably needs to be sprayed. 3) the light in the fridge does not work. 4) guest bed is very squeaky and kept the person sleeping in there up a bit. 5) the plastic shower curtain in the master is stained and should be replaced.
All of the above were minor and we still enjoyed our stay. With the above reconciled it would have been 5🌟
Overall, this was a good stay. Worth the $$ and was a comfortable stay. I would recommend to others, for sure. The host was extremely responsive and helpful.
Thank you for letting us stay on our trip to Nacogdoches."

Group trip","The home is exactly as described. It is a beautiful home and extremely comfortable. It is so accessible to everything in town. It only took us 5-10 minutes to get anywhere. It was a quiet neighborhood and a great walking area.
We would definitely rent this again!"

Stayed with kids","We had an amazing time staying at Jennifer’s home! It was so cute and cozy! We had everything we needed. The beds were comfortable, the bath towels were soft, the game selection was fun for the kids, and the living room was the perfect place for sitting and relaxing. The house is within walking distance to downtown which we really enjoyed. Thank you Jennifer for everything! We will definitely be back next year!"

Stayed a few nights","We were visiting the area for a Ladies church conference in Lufkin and could not resist the charm of Jennifer’s listing in Nacogdoches for her cute home! So we decided to book even though the drive was 30 minutes and so Thankful we did! The home is large and spacious so we all had our own space and the two bathroom plus four beds was a plus!
Very cute, very clean and comfortable! Jennifer was quick to respond with any questions we had! We are all ready to book again for next year!! You can’t go wrong booking this hidden gem! Oh! And there’s a Starbucks right down the street and ALLLLLL kinds of restaurants and activities in this quaint little town!! Thankful for a clean home and comfy stay!! We WILL return next year, Lord willing!"

Group trip","The Magnolia House was a perfect place for our stay in Nacogdoches! Our daughter will be attending SFA in the fall and we came for an open house. The house was absolutely perfect for our family. The primary bedroom was even decked out in purple, which was a delight to see! Jennifer was very friendly and responsive and super quick to answer any questions we had! We will be back over the next 4 years and will for sure stay at one of Jennifer’s adorable properties in the future. I highly recommend this house for your future stay!"
