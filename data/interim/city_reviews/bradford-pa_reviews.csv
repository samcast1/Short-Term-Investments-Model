Stayed with kids",What a beautiful home in a gorgeous setting. Our grandbaby just loved playing on the back porch. Debra went out of her way to ensure we had a baby gate and a high chair for our stay...which we didn't expect at all but were so grateful to have available when we needed it. Thank you for a great stay!

Stayed a few nights","I have stated at a lot of rentals and this was one of the cleanest I have ever stayed at. It also had a great supply of things that others seem to lack like ziplock bags, laundry detergent, pots and pans, etc, etc. I really felt like I was staying at someone home not a rental property. Debra was a great host throughout the process. Highly recommend."

Group trip","There are some good and bad things about this place.
Cons - I will start with the most concerning (my husband is an electrical engineer). He noticed the wiring in the kitchen has an open ground so the GFCI wires in the kitchen will not work properly, leaving people in danger of electrocution. Supports for two of the beds (in the front two bedrooms) were lying on the floor or were not stable. The beds squeaked and rocked once someone got in. The entrance to the loft is also inside one of the bedrooms. This is a 4 bedroom house. The railing is only a thick rope to the lift and stairs were narrow. The loft itself was about 20 degrees warmer than the rest of the house which would have been unbearable at the time. Two mouse traps were above the fridge - knowing there were mouse traps would have been helpful to be aware of going in.
Pros - The house itself was very clean. The area around the house is so great."

Group trip","The house has ample space and really is a nice older home. Our host was great and very responsive. The living room furniture was dirty and stained. It had been covered with throws I guess to hide the stains. The furniture was also very small and uncomfortable. A real sofa would have been nice as we had a group of 7 and there wasn’t ample furniture in any room to just gather together and visit. The towels in the home are all in rough shape as well. Overall if you need a place to stay in Bradford that’s convenient this place works, but if you’re expecting comfort for a large group I’d recommend looking at other options."

Stayed with kids","Delightful Stay at a Beautiful Hillside Property !!
From start to finish, our stay was filled with comfort, enjoyment, and a touch of historic charm.
First, the location of the house was simply breathtaking. Perched on a hill, the views were nothing short of spectacular. The surrounding natural beauty created a serene and peaceful atmosphere that immediately put us at ease. It was a true escape from the hustle and bustle of daily life.
The house itself was a gem. Every aspect was thoughtfully taken care of, and we found all the required amenities readily available. The rooms were spacious and well-appointed, providing ample comfort and relaxation.
We had the pleasure of meeting some of the neighbors during our stay, and their welcoming nature made us feel like part of the community.
Our host Michala was responsive and proactive in providing us with all the necessary information and offered recommendations for local sightseeing."

Stayed a few nights","This place super cool. Set at the end of a block at the top of a hill. Michala's House of a HIll is the perfect quiet respite. I need to be near Allegany for a running race in October and this weekend I drove up from Staten Island to train and scope out the area. I cannot wait to bring my family with me in a few weeks. The location of the house is a hop, skip, and jump to the park. Pretty much a straight shot and you're at the park in minutes. Come one - come all Skiers this winter.
The house is perfectly decorated, spacious, and equipped with everything you need to settle in quickly and feel like you're at home. The main room has a brilliant fireplace. Plenty of beds and bathrooms. And there is a cool little outside space with the perfect size fire pit.
Michala is a wonderful host. I understood everything I needed to do and she communicated constantly throughout my stay. Top Notch!
I am excited to come back again in October.
Enjoy!"

Group trip","Overall my stay at Michala's property was pleasant, the house was clean and most of the sleeping arrangements were good. A few words of warning if you're planning on staying with a large number of people, the couches are not very comfortable to sleep on, and the ""loft room"" is a futon in the attic. All in all I would recommend this bnb for groups of 4 to 7 people provided some of them will be sharing some.of the more comfortable beds"

The house is in a charming quiet neighborhood at the end of a street, with views of the mountains. If you’re a cook, best to bring your own equipment (knives!) since the kitchen is sparsely equipped. But I’d recommend the house to anyone! My family of 8 had an amazing stay!"

It was the perfect setup for our family- the bedrooms were huge, the beds comfortable, there was plenty of space to hangout AND our dog was welcome. The house had quirks that I’d expect from a home of it’s age and we found them charming. We wished the sofas were a bit more comfortable but besides that, everything was great. We’d definitely stay here again"

And even if you are not, this is a gorgeous old house with very comfortable beds and several spaces to hang out in. We were there with 3 couples and 1 single person to celebrate the holidays. The kitchen has more than enough space for several people to be preparing meals at the same time, and the house was impeccably clean. The host was also incredibly flexible and willing to deal with changes in our reservation and great with communication. I highly recommend this place."

Stayed a few nights","I am writing this email to inform you that I will not be paying for any additional amount that is being requested. The host, Michala, is not an honest person and can be better described as a conniving individual who will do anything to steal an extra, and unearned dollar. To elaborate further, on 07 July 21 I secured ""Home on a Hill: Allegheny Park Family Getaway"" and paid the required amount. Later that evening, at 6:14pm (yes, same day), Michala texted me personally saying ""Airbnb is a huge rip off with no value, I can save you hundreds if you cancel with them and book directly with me""- I still have every text message saved that she sent me. When I denied her request because I did not trust what she was doing, the following day my card was charged additionally without my consent. I reached out to Michala why that occured, she said that is something I have to take up with Airbnb. I started to get the feeling that this booking was a bad idea so when I reached out to Airbnb, they said that I would lose the amount of money that was paid initially so I did not cancel. The rental I reserved was from 26 Nov 21 to 02 Dec 21 but I ended up leaving on Wednesday, 01 Dec 21 due to the stay becoming unsafe. During our first night, some individual came over around midnight, knocking and ringing the doorbell and when I answered, they were looking for belongings they left inside the red truck (which was ours). We did not know who he was so after he left, that individual kept looking into our vehicles and walking around them, almost every night while we were there. Nonetheless, after we departed the rental, I did end up receiving confirmation on 03 Dec 21 @ 5:00pm that ""the house was left in great condition!"". Then on 05 Dec 21 @ 9:21am I received an email that the house had gum on the walls and the host questioned the number of guests present because a blanket was left downstairs. Michala called me on 05 Dec 21 @ 3:00pm accusing me of ""stealing their tv and that I better pay her for it"". I told her we left everything in great condition and to look at the Ring Camera because we didn't steal her tv, it was probably the individual who kept coming over asking for stuff. After denying Michala, I received an email from Airbnb that Michala wants $650 extra for damages such as a stain on the couch, piece of gum on the wall, scratched coffee table, but the television that I was accused of stealing, was not listed because she was caught falsifying information. I can confidently say that Michala is a conniving individual and provided me with the worst, and most unsafe experience, I have ever used."

We had 4 kids under 4 there and there was the perfect amount of space, all the babies can have their own space to nap, and you really can’t hear any house noise in the rooms. So much safe space for kids to walk around and explore. The two king beds are really comfortable - and the included pack n play was very helpful.
Michala’s communication is top notch and she was so helpful to us during our stay.
Bradford is a simple little place and there isn’t much around to do, but we absolutely loved stayed cozy in this beautiful home. Would definitely be back! Also amazing place to hike if you don’t have little kids and just older kids!"

Group trip","My bridesmaids and I stayed here before my wedding. This house was clean and spacious and decorated very nicely. We had difficulty finding the house at night originally, and there were issues with the check-in process. But I think the check-in issues may have been due to the app. I attempted using both the app and the email to send my ID for the check-in, but for some reason Michala wasn't able to see it any of the times that I sent it. I also had some issues trying to get ahold of Michala to resolve the ID check-in hiccup, but that may have been due to spotty cell reception. This was not my first stay in an airbnb, but it WAS my first experience being the contact person who booked the house. The issues very well may have been my fault, I can't say for sure. Though I also had some more experienced airbnb-ers trying to help me. It definitely was a frustrating experience getting settled, but once we finally made it into the house, the stay was a good one."

Stayed over a week","We stayed for a month
Lovely decor but lacking in quality to make it worth the ridiculous price tag.
Kitchen items are sub par - we ended up buying our own frying pan as the items provided were trash.
One drinking glass in the whole house. Two other glasses were snifters? Candle holders? We used our camping kitchen ware.
Decor is lovely though, but it’s surface beauty only.
Host was very responsive with issues with door not closing and leaking roof - this was torrential rain so not a property issue in my mind.
Host also super helpful on fixing WiFi when storm took it out.
It’s a nice house but not worth the price at all.
Back patio is not kept clean. Slate wall falling down.
Light switches work 95% of the time."

It was the middle point between a number of family members, so it was by chance that we found this home in this town, but it couldn’t have been more welcoming. Plenty of bedrooms and space, beautifully decorated, and impeccably clean. It felt like home for the time we were there, not like we were intruding on someone else’s space. Michala was on top of communication and answered all my questions very quickly. She even shipped me something I had accidentally left there! I’m not sure I’ll ever have a reason to visit Bradford again, but I have great memories (with excellent wallpaper)."

Stayed a few nights","We had a great stay! Michala was very communicative and worked with us on options for bringing our dogs with us. The house is in a very quiet neighborhood almost at the end of the street so almost no traffic or noise. The yard is pretty steep so be careful if mobility is a challenge for you, but the views at the top of the hill are 100% worth it. This was a great home base for our adventuring to various local state parks and forests. I did also end up working 1 morning while there (the dark side of full-time work remote) and the internet was solid."

You have everything you need in the house: a nice kitchen, including dishwasher, and a washer and dryer in the basement. There are nice views on a forest. Near the house is also a fire pit. We bought wood but didn’t have chance to use it. (We didn’t expect to have snow in April.) I highly recommend this house for a vacation."

Great taste for the decoration, and lovely bed linen (not easy to find 😉). One comment: there are 3 windows in the bedroom, hence lots of light, but only one blackout curtain. ☺️ We would definitely recommend this address and book it again, as it is worth the 5 stars. We had a wonderful stay in Bradford, and a fun sunny Sunday afternoon in a brewery in Olean. Thank you Jessica!"

Group trip","A beautiful cabin in the Allegheny National Forest, built by the owner from wood harvested from fallen trees on the property, this is the perfect place to relax on the porch or around the fire pit. The cabin is charming and comfortable, well stocked with everything you need. The national forest is right outside the backdoor, and we walked the trail along the creek to see two different beaver dens not too far away. Very close to Kinzua Dam and Reservoir, hiking at Jakes Rocks, and charming small towns like Jamestown NY and Bradford PA. Barry and Diane were great hosts, communicating quickly before our visit and stopping by to make sure everything was OK at the cabin. At our request, Barry even brought his three goats to the cabin so we could take a walk in the woods with them! I would love to go back and spend more time in this wonderful place!"

The house is soo beautiful with incredible details right in the middle of forest. It has everything you'd need including washer/dryer, dishwasher, barbecue station, fire pit, all sorts of utensils, tools, and comfortable beds. The best part was the host. Barry was too kind to offer us his kayak, canoe, and even his truck! He offered us the cider he brew and they were tooo good! He also gave us instructions on what to do around the area and where to go. We ended up going to a nearby lake to hike, swim, kayak, and ride a boat. Also, there is a beautiful short hike with beaver dam right outside the house. All 7 of us have only the best things to say about this trip and the hosts!

Group trip","The timber frame cabin and property are absolutely beautiful and well worth the price of admission. Even better, Barry was a fantastic host - friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the region with more recommendations than we could hope to accomplish in 2 days. I definitely recommend checking out the rock formations and beaver pond just down hill from the cabin.
The cabin itself is the perfect size for a family with kids or small groups with enough private spaces to get away for a bit while also having numerous areas to gather and spend time as a group. We had a rainy weekend so couldn't enjoy the outdoor fire pit area which looked amazing, but the covered porch suited our needs despite the dreary weather.
I couldn't have asked for a better experience, from the hosts to the cabin and property, and am definitely planning to return in the future.
Thank you, Barry, for making it such a memorable trip!"

This clean, spacious and stunning timber framed cabin sits on 25 private acres which has a beautiful stream, large rock formations, beaver dams and ponds. You could explore just the private acres on your trip and not be bored. We were able to utilize the fully stocked propane kitchen for meals with ease. All water on the property is safe to drink and filtered and heating and cooling worked well.
To sum it up, the accommodations were wonderful. Barry, our host, gave us great recommendations of local restaurants and has extensive knowledge of the area’s many trails and outlooks. Barry was genuinely kind, quickly responsive and wanted to ensure that our trip was memorable and fun. If you’re in the area for any activity, look no further.

Stayed a few nights",I rented this Airbnb for my husband as a surprise getaway with his buddies. They really wanted to go ice fishing in Allegheny state Park but unfortunately there was no ice. But they still spent two days in the cold on the water and spent their night in this amazing rental. They all had amazing comments about how spacious and clean the home was and raved about the wildlife just outside the door. This rental had everything they needed plus some. this rental is staying on my favorites list for the next time we want to get away. Thank you Samantha for such a wonderful place.

The grill and the moveable fire pit were great amenities. There were plenty of condiments in the fridge (in case you forget to pack something) as well as soaps, shampoos, and such in the bathroom.
It smelled great there. The air purifiers and the air fresheners are a great touch!
Marilla Reservoir is beautiful and the main trails there were nice.
Gilbert's Reservoir is quiet and peaceful. Both places would be great for a canoe or kayak."

She is prompt, extremely friendly and takes any questions or concerns or suggestions you may have very seriously. The house is perfectly located. If you want peace and nature, you are in the middle of it. Downtown is only a 12 minute drive away. The welcome book is extremely helpful. The house is newly renovated too to bottom and as the name says, cozy. We had a surprise spring snowfall while we were there and the house was super warm. One morning I was on the porch with my coffee and an owl was hooting in the woods behind the house, the next morning was a turkey calling. I highly recommend this property and will definitely be staying there again."

Stayed a few nights","What a lovely spot! We stayed for 5 days to do some hiking in the Allegheny National Forest and this cabin was perfectly situated to get the most out of the outdoor activities in the area. We did the Beehunter, Blacksnake Mountain, and Bear Caves/Mount Seneca trails; all were stunning! We had an issue with the WiFi the first day and Samantha was quick to help; she even called Verizon to get the issue sorted. The space is so comfy (the chairs/couches are SO cozy) and the beds were awesome, giving us both an excellent night's rest each night. If you are a coffee drinker and don't like Keurig, bring your own coffee apparatus; that was the one missing thing for us, but Samantha made us aware of this before the trip began. They provide firewood for an outdoor fire pit and there are lost of spices in the cabinet in case you forgot to bring something. We had an awesome time and will definitely go back!"

The property was glittered with fire flys at night and so quiet and peaceful both night and day. You do have to drive down a dirt road to get to the cabin so just be mindful of that. There is not a thing I could complain about. This place was lovely and very spacious."

The location has several hiking trails/walks within a few miles. We also traveled to nearby state parks for some great scenic views. Overall this place was perfect and we would definitely use again if we travel through the area.

Well stocked with essentials in case you forgot something. Grounds are well kept and there is a lot of room for parking. Truck & 24' boat / trailer had plenty of room to maneuver... even if you pull in the wrong way like I did the first time. Hint: back in for the easiest in out. Quiet as can be in the area... we sat out on the front porch and our thoughts were the only thing you could hear. Unless its blistering hot... the no a/c thing is not an issue at all. Nice cool, fresh mountain air cools down the cabin for a great sleeping temp. Looking forward to a return stay when we come back in the area to boat. Real nice launch ramp about 8 miles down the street. Thank you for a great place to stay and for allowing pets... our dog loved being able to run around in the front yard."

Having two bathrooms, and a full kitchen was convenient. The host even provided an additional table for us. By the end of the evening, there were ample accommodations for many of us to stay the night together. Furniture was clean and comfortable, plentiful blankets added to the coziness in addition to an electric fireplace! Generous storage space, linens and family games available. Dog friendly but super clean, too! Price was excellent when considering the space, accommodations and location. We will never look elsewhere for this annual gathering! So happy!"

Stayed with a pet","I recently had the pleasure of staying at Calvin Court for a fantastic six-day getaway! My fur baby and I were in town for the Italian festival and to catch up with friends and family, and this charming Airbnb truly exceeded our expectations in every way.
The highlight of our stay was undoubtedly the delightful side porch. Whether it was enjoying a cup of coffee in the morning or unwinding with a glass of wine in the evening, the serene atmosphere of the porch provided the perfect setting for relaxation. The distant echoes of cheers from the nearby high school football game added a touch of local ambiance, giving us a genuine sense of the community's spirit.
The thoughtful amenities provided enhanced our overall experience…. The air conditioning unit in the bedroom ensured a comfortable night's sleep, while strategically placed box fans kept the downstairs area cool during the daytime. We can’t wait to return!"

Stayed with a pet","Arrived late, very dark & stumbled on loose pavers at front door. Porch light was off - we had to go back to the car to get a cell phone/ flashlight for the lockbox. We had to go through the house testing switches to figure out which ones went with which lights. There were two that were burned out. Not a biggie -- we are not going to call for maintenance late at night but cleaning should have caught it. Downstairs matched the pictures on the listing and there were MORE than a few helpful things tucked in drawers for travelers. The blinds are 1/2 missing from the porch. The 1st floor was nicely renovated and modern, great TV & Internet. The upstairs seemed worn particularly the towels. Beds: 1 QU, 1 DOU & 1 TW. When we packing up, we check around to make sure we leave nothing. We found empty water bottles, perfume and vape cartridges from ??? before us. We disposed of everything not wanting to be blamed. Made us wonder what had been cleaned for us or not. A lot of $ but nice amenities."

The cottage was pristine, quaint and so cozy! The owners were detailed with the decorative style and provided every item that was needed. They were even so loving and kind to think of our pups and provided them with their own blankie😊
We enjoyed the hikes with our pups on The Morrison Trail and Jakes Rocks. In addition, the road in front of the cottage proved to be a safe walk as well.
We celebrated with good eats and drinks at The Westline Inn and Tack’s Inn. Everyone was so welcoming and the service was amazing!
The New Year ended with a light coating of snow………

Thank you for allowing us to ring in the New Year in the perfect place! We look forward to visiting again soon😊"

Stayed a few nights","one of the best AirBnB’s I’ve ever stayed in. I often prefer to book hotels because you know what to expect in terms of amenities, but this place had everything you’d expect from a hotel and more! Very thoughtfully put together, I can tell the hosts actually care about hospitality and not just ROI. The location is great. Very quiet and peaceful. I will say, the house is not super isolated, it is very close to the house the hosts live in, so if you are expecting the privacy of the outdoors, you may be disappointed. Also, the internet was not the fastest or most reliable, so if you are working remote with video calling, it might pose an issue. Having said that, I worked remote from here for 2 days and was fine! Would stay again."

Becki provides many little extra amenities which are a appreciated nice touch.

The goodies basket, the Terry robes, the coffee pods and all the extra touches allowed us to feel pampered!
The pillow top mattress with luxurious sheets made us want to stay in bed! I am glad we didn’t because there was so much beauty outside. Kinzua bridge is a must! The kitchen was perfect for quick meals, but there are also many great restaurants in the area! You provided many resources in your Timberdoodle Guidebook.
Finally thank you for accommodating us on such short notice. You are truly super host!!!"

This is the perfect cottage for a couple that are interested in exploring everything the Allegheny National Forest has to offer. When we expressed interest in biking one of the local trails, Becki made sure their bikes were ready for us to use. Mark setup the fire pit for us each evening so all we had to do was light the fire and enjoy. Their knowledge of the local area made our entire trip a lot easier. We highly recommend staying at the Kellidoodle Cottage and will stop by again if we're in the area."

Stayed a few nights","We thoroughly enjoyed our four night stay at the Kellidoodle cabin at Timberdoodle. Hosts, Becki and Mark were just a stone throw away if needed and we would see them daily as we came and went. It was nice to know they were right there if need be. We ate at the cabin most nights for dinner and enjoyed using the patio table/chairs provided. We found the wifi to be excellent inside and outside the cabin.
One of my favorite things was the vanity in the bathroom. There was soap, shampoo, body lotion and make up removers all supplied. The towels and sheets were of high quality and I would have loved to have had the same as we continued our travels, let alone for our own home! A few evenings cooled down overnight to the upper 50's and the bedding provided made for cozy sleeping. And speaking of sleeping - the bed was very comfortable - not too hard and not too soft - just right! In the heat of the day a window AC unit did a great job keeping the space comfortable.
We used the kitchen quite a bit. The hot plate came in handy to boil water for corn on the cob and pasta. (You do have to allow extra time for the water to boil!) Detergent is supplied for dish washing along with pot holders and a wide variety of utensils. The refrig was a nice size with a freezer compartment large enough to have two ice cube trays stacked - very nice in the hot summer weather. A Keurig and pods were supplied - for us unimportant as we do not drink coffee!
You can't go wrong staying at this cabin and in this location. It was close to many areas.......Kinzua Bridge State Park, the Allegheny National Forest with Kinzua Beach and Dam. We traveled a short distance away to the Eldred WWII Museum which is quite impressive, especially if you're a WWII buff. We also went south to Cook's Forest State Park, which we had not realized has the such old and tall trees."

This space is a wonderful studio guest house with separate bath and separate kitchen. It provides ample space for two, or perhaps with another guest. My husband and I enjoyed a wonderful weekend which included cross country skiing just north at the Art Roscoe Cross country ski trails. Bradford offered great spots for eating and any other necessary errands. The space itself is warm, comfortable, and the hosts supply every possible need, and are very available for any questions via texting through the Airbnb site. We felt cared for, yet given plenty of privacy. We intend to return again and again. Thanks to our gracious hosts!"

The cabin is very clean. Comfortable bed. The shower is hot. And they leave snacks for you! That was amazing because we were there after it snowed so it was nice to not have to worry about going out to get snacks. You can easily get to hiking trails - rimrock overlook and kinzua bridge. We traveled into the town of Kane for lunch one day and you can find quite a few restaurants and shops there.
My husband and I both loved it here and plan on going back in the summer . The snow was beautiful but I’m sure the summer is amazing!"

Windows that open, a ceiling fan, baseboard heat/cool, and a heater in the bathroom would accommodate any seasonal temperatures. We were especially impressed by how efficiently furnished and well equipped the kitchen is, albeit small. Loved the special touches like plush robes and slippers, bathroom toiletries, games, books, milk and juice, breakfast and trail treats, and outdoor grill to use to cook our kabobs from Bell's Meat and Poultry Market. The location proved perfect to explore lots of the ANF, scenic drives around it, Kinzua State Park and Skywalk, and into NY. Sprague's Maple Farm's pancakes and deep fried French toast were a brunch treat too."

Becki's place is so welcoming and cozy, the decorating makes you instantly feel comfortable and at home. She has all of the little extra special touches - soft towels, a super comfortable bed, toiletries, yummy snacks, breakfast items - everything we didn't even know that we needed. We travel with our dog-child, so we eat a lot of meals at places we stay, and the kitchen space was roomy, and cooking was no problem from the hot plate or from the cookware, which was all in such good condition. The patio space also provides a great area for grilling and enjoying a glass of wine, while immersed in the quiet of the forest. Becki's place was immaculate, and she is an excellent communicator. The location is very convenient to trails, the Kinzua Bridge State Park (another wow), Bradford and Kane. Loui and I did meet Mark, who is very friendly and fantastic at providing local information. Unfortunately, our schedules didn't align to meet Becki and Baxter (ah ha, this could be our reason to go back!). We can't wait to plan our next trip to this area, just to stay in the Timberdoodle Lodge again!"

Stayed a few nights","The cottage was amazing, and the hosts were even better!!!! My husband and I were on a road trip for a vacation, and this was our first time in the area. We stumbled on this property accidentally through Airbnb, and it was such luck! The cottage location is absolutely stunning!, and it's very quiet and peaceful! The hosts, Becki and Mark, live on the same property, which was very nice for us because they gave us a lot of great suggestion of what to do and where to go. They also provided two bikes, and told us about great bike trails to take. Even though Becki and Mark live right there, we felt like we had our privacy. At the same time, Mark and Becki were such a pleasure to talk to, that we invited them to join us at the fire pit. They brought some wine, and we had a great evening. Speaking of fire pit. It's the cutest thing behind the cottage, super romantic, and the hosts provide marshmallow fixings, sticks, and wood! My husband and I couldn't stop talking about all of the thoughtful details we kept discovering during our short stay. From COMPLETELY stocked bathroom ( I have never seen anything like this even a fancy hotel) - from basic toiletries, to makeup remover, tums, shaving cream, bath robes, and much more! Also the kitchen was stocked with some breakfast items, and snacks! They were extra phone chargers in the bedroom drawers, books, games, candles, and lots of romantic and thoughtful touches and decorations. We had an amazing time, and highly recommend this place!

However, the kitchen is quite small and not recommended for anyone over 6 foot tall. On the other hand the private gas grill outside is clean with a table and a couple chairs where you can cook and enjoy a drink.
The area is practically silent and the host lives next door if there are any issues."

The cozy, well appointed cabin made for the perfect spot for a couple’s retreat, and the peace and quiet was a welcome reprieve from awaking to a crying baby at 5am every day. From Becki’s homemade breakfasts (enough for every morning we were there), to books and board games scattered throughout the cabin, to helpful guides to the numerous hiking locations within minutes of the cabin, we truly could not have asked for anything more.

Stayed a few nights","Very cute cabin in a beautiful part of Pennsylvania! My boyfriend and we’re just looking for a quick couple day getaway after our we were not able to take our longer vacation we had planned. Becki was a great host and the place had thoughtful touches and was decorated perfectly. There were even tasty breakfast items for us waiting in the fridge...what a nice touch especially before we headed out to hike one morning. The only drawback for me personally was since it has been warmer there was no AC HOWEVER the cabin in is in the woods so it stayed relatively cool but I guess I am spoiled with the AC normally, haha. The ceiling fan in the space keeps the space cool and windows open at night did the trick. This cabin is located 15-20 minutes away from all the food sites in the area: Kinzua dam, Kinzua bridge park, Allegheny national forest and tons of trails, Bradford, PA and Kane, PA..etc. If you are looking to explore this area this is the perfect spot to stay!"

The location is great, being just at the edge of Allegheny Park. It sits back a private road which is not far off a main road that takes you to many attractions.
The area is quiet with amazing stars, yet the owners are just right next store for anything you might need.
The cabin has that outdoorsy rustic look but the inside looks brand new. The place is well set up with most anything you might want. It is incredibly decorated and has many luxury items. The bed is like a cloud, the robes(yes robes) felt like they are made of the softest material know to man. Now let’s talk toilet paper. Most Airbnb’s have that awful cheap toilet paper that you need to ball up a Mile of it to use. This toilet paper was thick and soft and wonderful. Nuff said!
I could go and and on but I think you get the idea. If you need to be in this area, stay here!"

As a couple who love wildlife and photography we always look for parks and trails to explore for wildlife activity. As we did find plenty of those, we also found we didn’t have to leave property for some really good birding. Valerie has feeders placed perfectly in yard outside large windows so you can view either from inside or from outside under covered patios. Sat outside with coffee watching birds and relaxing to sound of wind-chimes on property. Zen moment!
House was easy to get to. Plenty of history in this region. Zippo Museum, Penn Brad Oil Museum. Lovely Mom and Pop shops to visit. Great eateries as well. Friendly people.

I was pleased that I was able to pull my truck into the garage as there was additional snow expected overnight, and I felt comfortable as I was unloading. There are a massive amount of amenities available in case you had forgotten something. Very comfortable chairs and sofa in the main living space and the bedrooms were spacious as well. There were plenty of blankets and pillows in case you got cold, or needed a different or multiple pillows. Bathroom was clean. Bed linen was clean as well. I am going to keep this nice cabin in mind for future trips, since it is basically the same price as a hotel room. Now if only it came with a personal chef...LOL. Great place and a definite recommend. Thanks for sharing your home whit me! ~Jeff"

Stayed a few nights","Exactly what we wanted. Normally we might book a hotel for a weekend break but we decided to go a different route this time, and so glad we did. We live only about an hour south of this place but our neighborhood is a noisy one, located between very busy streets and 24/7 factories, so the silence...really was golden. It was great to just chill. Apropos of nothing really, my first time (somehow) staying in a log home of any sort, and it had great ambience."

Stayed a few nights",This is our go to place when we go to visit family & friends. The location is absolutely perfect. Dog friendly means we can take our fur kids but you would never know it is a pet home. Our12 1/2 year old labrador spends 90% of his time on the sofa in the sun room. I asked him why and he told me because it's so comfy and he can watch everything that comes and goes in the backyard. The 8 year old lab likes the cozy comforts and our pocket pitty can walk up to any window and look out.

Stayed with a pet","-I didn’t like having to call someone & interact with a man idk but once communication was made, he was SO NICE! Very accommodating. Jim had the driveway plowed for us twice during our five night stay due to snow.
-Very nature-y and cabin-y. It is strange to stay in a home where a person lives, where the fridge, drawers, & shower have someone’s personal things in it. Not typical of an Airbnb.
-If you are a neat freak or clean freak, this is not the place for you. There are dead bugs hanging around. It’s dusty.
-There is no heat upstairs, which we didn’t know until we had to sleep upstairs because the stairs are too steep for people with weak knees. Very steep stairs. One of the rooms upstairs doesn’t close off. There is no door.
-Babbling brook through the landscape. Lovely views.
-Comfy couches & recliners in the living room. No place for a meal. There is a small table for 1-2 with 1 chair. Tv dinner stands in the living room for use.
-Nicer than most hotels in the area.
-Safe."

Stayed a few nights","I love the authenticity of this place—It’s clearly the well-loved home of someone who values the great outdoors (…and dogs, baseball, and family), not just an afterthought for Instagram-able weekends away.
We originally booked the cabin for the first weekend of November but had to reschedule. Lamenting this because I imagine the area to be stunning at that time. Still beautiful in the winter with some snow on the ground—To enjoy that we drove to Ellicottville to ski Holiday Valley and explore the cute town there.
Temps dropped below zero during our stay, and I was impressed by how warm the cabin remained.
My only caveat is that if you are someone who is uncomfortable with a little dust and dog hair, this may not be the place for you."

Stayed a few nights","Get ready to relax and unwind.
This place is amazing. If you’re looking for a stay that offers rest, relaxation and a stress free time, this is the place to stay.
We went to watch the Perseid meteor shower peak and there was plenty of wide open sky for our viewing pleasure.
HUMMINGBIRDS!!! There are 100’s of hummingbirds, bobbing and weaving between the various flowers and the hummingbird feeders (which you can fill if empty, there was a jug on the back porch).
The porch wraps around the front and side to the back and is covered in both the front and the back. There was more than enough room in the cabin, porch and property. Just my wife and I went this time, but when we go back we plan on bringing our three adult children and our dog.
There are some hiking trails that start right on the property. The trails aren’t clearly marked, so what I did was every time there was a fork in the road I went to the left, that way on the way back it was always going right.
This is great place to stay to disconnect and unwind. A couple days here and you can feel the stress falling away."

Stayed a few nights","My boyfriend and I had the privilege this past weekend to drive down from Buffalo and stay at this cabin. (Hand built by the owner, Jim!)
Very welcoming, clean and comfortable home with all the amenities. Cool antique furniture throughout (check out the stove). Big wraparound porch, perfect for stargazing. Jim also opened his home to our dog, Sampson, who had a wonderful time exploring the outdoors and sleeping on the leather coach.
Two beautiful streams border the property and trails exist that go deep into the woods out back & were perfect for morning hikes with the pup. If hikes aren’t for you, take a seat in the backroom addition and bird watch or play chess! Overall peace and quiet location where we really got to unwind and celebrate my boyfriend’s birthday. Essentially you never have to leave the grounds for the perfect spring getaway. But if you do- rivers full of trout only twenty minutes away!
Loved our stay and cannot wait to come back!
Thank you again, Jim and Jennifer."

Stayed a few nights","Great cabin at a great value! You could really have a great get together with up to six people at this location. We had two travelers and enjoyed the quiet and the time we had together in the full kitchen! The porch was our favorite spot and we looked out over the property and watched the birds. The wraparound porch is so relaxing. Well water is definitely stinky but does affect your shower or brushing your teeth. Bring bottled water for drinking and coffee.
We visited a few establishments in the town and went to nearby towns and had amazing hospitality and great food! Stop down at the Rixford Well for a wonderful burger called the Welly.
There is a fire pit and Amblewood 10 joy the evening and enough lawn space if you want to bring corn hole boards or lawn games of any kind
Make sure you take a 30 minute drive to Kinzua Bridge State Park. It is worth the trip and so informative and well done and free."

The clear, star covered canvased sky at night was a highlight of our trip. This location was convenient to check out the Mansion District of Smethport, Kinzua Bridge State Park, Elk State Park, Bendigo State Park, St. Mary's, Kane and Bradford. You will not be disappointed if you choose to stay at this pet-friendly, remote home!"

It had all the comforts of home, plus a winter wonderland of woods. I spent my days reading and watching birds out the back window. The bird feeding station was such a treat. We took a walk around the property through the snow, had a fire outside, and used the wood burning stove to make dinner. I posted pictures I took on fb and 10 of my friends asked for the Airbnb link. I would definitely go back, and highly recommend this place!"

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed our two-night stay at Jim’s cabin with our two small dogs. He was very friendly on the phone, and we appreciated the contactless check-in. There is one house across the street, but you can’t really see it from the cabin, so it feels like no one else is around. Since someone does live in this cabin, it does have a lived-in feel. We took a walk up the hill on the dirt road behind the cabin, and enjoyed a fire in the fire pit (there was more than enough firewood). There is a big deer head on the wall, which was personally upsetting to us, but we do understand that this is a big hunting area, so it doesn’t affect my review. I just wanted to point it out in case others would want to know in advance; it is in the back room that we didn’t spend much time in anyways. The stairs to the two second-floor bedrooms are steep but manageable, and there is an easily-accessible first-floor bedroom if anyone in your group has trouble with stairs. The bathroom is on the first floor. The town of Bradford is ~15 minutes away, if you need to do any shopping. The wi-fi worked well and was consistent for basic internet use. We have Sprint/T-Mobile and got spotty cell service there. Google Maps tries to tell you the house is located very soon after turning onto the road, but it isn’t. Just keep driving down the road, and it will be the last house on your right when the pavement ends (if you arrive while it is light out, it looks exactly like the pictures; download offline maps if you aren’t sure if you will have service). Overall, this was a very peaceful stay in a relaxing location."

The water had a sulfur-like smell so if that bothers you this might not be the place for you."
