Stayed a few nights","Being an Airbnb Host as well and with my last name Byrd, the Birdhouse jumped right off the map as a perfect selection! Not sure if she staged it, but 2 Real Live Dove were sitting right near the door & chose to ""COO & Fly-away"" as we made our entry. A lot of love is tucked away in such a way, a perfect little nest!
Making videos, Snappin' Out as we go of course we made one for the BIRDHOUSE, using our little splash of humor. We had no idea of what an EXTRACTOR SWITCH was located in the well-appointed throne area, so we chose to make a video! Snappin' Grannies will certainly remember this special place in Eagle Pass! We came to make our Voices heard and appreciate her realizing the value of offering up her home! Trust me if we ever make it back we will not Pass this one up! Thank you and may the Blessings continue, my friend. Bossy Marty & Cuzin' Sandy"

Stayed a few nights","The family was wonderful and lovely caring people. They went out of their way to try to help me become comfortable and to understand how the AC and light switches worked. The setting is lovely - full of birds, butterflies, etc., but a little work is needed. The path to the ""room"" needs to have a better path, as I came in after dark and although they had movement activated, lights that were slow and staggered, so I had to stop and wait for them to make sure I didn't mistep. The WiFi was extrmely slow - to the point I had friends come over to make sure I wasn't doing something wrong.
There was no cable. I was never able to watch Hulu, Netflix, Prime, etc, because it would not connect, however I was able to use my phone with WiFi easily. There were no windows I could see out of it. So if you like to meditate, like being in an extremely small space to feel cozy, this is the place for you."

Stayed one night","August 7, 2022 - First experience with an Airbnb rental and I was nervous about staying in an unknown person's room in the backyard. I read all the reviews, prior to booking and decided to take a chance. I was pleasantly surprised. My experience with Catherine (via text) and her mother, Ruth (in person) were both very pleasant and ready to answer any questions. ""The Birdhouse"" will have us returning! My husband and I could not have been more pleased with the cleanliness, the toiletries, and the beautiful details of the curtains with the birds, and the bird and eucalyptus ornament on the wall. The bed was comfortable, and we appreciated that the room cooled down very quickly. I loved the thank you note posted on the inside of the door with both their numbers in case you needed anything. Ruth greeted us and made us feel welcomed with her big smile and then gave us our total privacy. No ants or other insects were seen either inside or outside (mentioned in one review). It was a totally wonderful experience; we will and encourage everyone to support small family businesses.
Javier and Rosemary Barrera."

The garden to get to the house is very nice and well maintained with lots of cool decorations. A big plus for this listing is the neighborhood location. It is private, secure, and calm. I will be staying there again next time I visit Eagle Pass, and it’s a listing I would recommend to a friend."

The place is usually very clean and on the surface it was clean however, there was debri found in the bedding and cockroaches in the bathroom. While there was spray for the cockroaches, this experience was a bit disspointing this time. Because he was such a great host in the past, I'd be willing to give this another try if these issues are resolved. Best of Luck"

Perfect little get away for a couple. All the amenities are perfect from the cute little kitchen all the way to the chilly AC amd a bbq pit out back. Speaking of the back There's a big covered porch with a table to enjoy the wonderful view amd sounds of nature. The neighborhood is very queit and welcoming. There's a small gas station/ market and food trucks, and if you can't find what you need Walmart and the rest of the town is a short drive. It's also a short drive to the casino as well. I will definitely be booking with him again for the next trip"

Stayed with kids","Great little place. Clean and quiet. The value on what you get is pretty great. They do offer a sofa bed but I would suggest you bring a mattress pad or a thick blanket to put over. It's not the most comfortable but it did serve our purpose for the 1 night. Truly, that was our only complaint. The ease of everything else made up for that. We will be booking this again in the future."

Stayed one night","We had another wonderful stay at Rich’s apt while we visited the nearby casino. The location is ideal as it is literally down the street from the casino. Easy to find as Google maps took me directly to the apt. Check-in is super easy and the location feels safe. The apt is really clean (love the smell of fresh towels/sheets) and the bed was really comfy. Rich was kind enough to leave out snacks, water, and cereal. There is a picnic table and BBQ pit in the backyard for easy use. Enjoyed the beautiful sunrise. Will definitely be staying there again when I’m in the area."

I decided to check Airbnb and came across Rich’s beautiful cozy home. The pictures do not do it justice!! It is extremely clean, comfortable bed (slept like a queen), and came equipped with all the extras. The little amenities was nice to have...just in case. My only complaint was that we had to go back home!! I really wanted to stay longer. We sat outside back on the morning of check out, to enjoy the breathtaking views. This is seriously a hidden gem! Can’t wait to go back again!"

Group trip","The first red flag was the long grass when we first checked in. I contacted the lady, who stated that her gardener didn't go, but she would send someone a few days later.
Then we walked into the kitchen, and the cabinets were filthy and needed cleaning inside and out.
As for the bathroom, there was no vent, and the window we couldn’t open it because it was sealed with a black sponge. It will get very muggy and hot.
They didn’t have central air and had small AC units on the windows. The house will get very humid even with all the windows units on.
The couch had stains and looked like it was about to break at any moment.
Several blinds in the rooms were broken.
Baseboards were also dirty.
The blankets were dirty, and didn’t seem like they even washed them.
The TV remote didn’t work, and we had to turn it on manually."

As soon as you walk into the house you can definitely notice how extremely clean and neat the house is. It was spotless and spacious! It might look small from the outside but don’t let the outside fool you. The rooms were great and just the right size for us. I think you can’t beat the price for how cute, cozy, and clean the house is. The kitchen was super clean and enough space to utilize. The rest room was a comfortable size and clean as well. The bedrooms were bigger than I expected, which was awesome! The rooms were extremely neat and clean, and had enough pillows to use. We didn’t get to utilize the back yard, but maybe next time we’ll have more time too. It quickly felt comfortable and safe for us. Our kids didn’t want to leave, we had such a great first Airbnb experience at Carmen’s place."

Only hiccup was the bathroom door did not stay shut properly so we could not lock it. Not a big deal and I'm sure the owners have fixed since I let them know about it. Good value and I recommend if you go to Eagle Pass."

Stayed a few nights","Inside was clean, rear yard trashed out . Older home so I guess that’s why the outside is like that.Swing play set falling apart, not very safe, Rear yard needs a lot TLC . WiFi never worked. Very noisy neighborhood, didn’t expect to hear the train horn that loud on the early morning hours. No heater in bathroom or outlet to hook up small portable one, had to buy electrical extensions and run them from across the hall. I apologize I usually don’t write reviews but I was very disappointed with this location. Maybe ok for adults but not when you have little ones."

The power went out due to extremely high winds, which caused the AC to stop working. We didn’t notice until we got back to the Airbnb which was late. It ended up getting down to 55 degrees inside so we layered up (no ones fault) Other than that, great place!"

We did finally find the key ourselves though. The listing says that bed linens and bed sheets are provided. Not really. There is a fitted sheet and a comforter on each bed. That's it. When I contacted her about there not being a top sheet for any of the beds she lied and said that it was in the description and that it was for the ""safety"" of her and her family?! Needless to say we would not stay here again. This was NOT a Superhost experience!"

Tho it is good that he alerts you when someone, which was good cause I would take a look outside if he barked. Downside is the barking. other then that the place was very stylish inside. I slept comfortably and was very pleased with my stay."

The hosts were quick to respond to any communication. The gate and security cameras offered good security. I would highly recommend this property if you are travelling to the Eagle Pass area.

Beds are soft and comfortable. Relaxing patio area! Five minutes away from casino. I love this place. I will definitely be coming back with my family. Hosts are super helpful and understanding! Luxury at an affordable price! ❤️ 😍 Loved everything! Highly recommend this stay!

The home is exactly as described in the listing and Mary Lou herself was very quick with any questions I had. I would highly recommend this listing to anyone who is wanting to stay near the casino.

Stayed with kids","We got the Airbnb to catch the April 18, 2024 solar eclipse and the location couldn’t have been any better. There was some loud noise from the casino but once you stepped inside it wasn’t too loud or entirely disrupting. We used the bbq pit on the day of the eclipse to avoid traffic trying to get food and the grill was easily accessible and there was fire wood provided. The host even stopped by to say hello and gave us lighter fluid and charcoal after they saw us struggling to maintain a fire lol they were very hospitable and we highly recommend. The place is actually bigger than it appears on the pics as there were plenty of towels and supplies needed for our stay. The pull out sofa is a little uncomfortable as it dips in the middle so I would not recommend anyone with bad backs to count on getting good sleep on the pull out bed."

We don't like to spend all day at the casino so it was great to come back to a place where we could spend sometime to enjoy each other's company or kick back and watch some movies. It's about a 2 min drive over to the casino and it's a one way street to and back. If it wasn't for the weather I would probably enjoyed a cook out. Something to look forward to next time. It think we just found our spot for future Kickapoo visits!!

We did not cook any meals here but if we were going to, kitchen was well stocked. TV's were easy to operate. The outdoor space was lovely and made for great sunset watching in the backyard. Parking in front was spacious. Location is within walking distance to casino but we chose to drive since it was misty and chilly. Highly recommend this place and will stay again in the future."

Clean. But also appealing rustic touches. We stayed three nights and the open kitchen had everything you need. Including a special basket of Cristina’s Chalet goodies… mmmm good. Quality finishes everywhere you look. In the mornings we had coffee on the back porch accompanied by quiet, expansive nature views, and the sweet smell of the the misty dew. The same location was perfect for evenIng sunsets and a glass of wine. Quiet and private, yet only two minutes from the casino. Had fun watching movies on the big screen! The bed was perfect, really comfortable, and put us to sleep. Bathrooms elegantly appointed. And if you need anything Maricela and Jose are a simple phone call away."

always keep the house clean. We find dog crappy in the house exit and I understand that Miguel is not at fault, but he has to put a sign for dog owners."

Check in was at 4 and we where like 10 minutes aways when i booked. Miguel was super quick to respond to our stay and let me know our room wasn't ready but he had another unit available for us to stay in. The unit was very clean, very spacious, beds where good and location was good as well no problems getting to the apartment or casino. Loved that the casino was about 10min away. Don't hesitate to book this place!! I will most definitely get this place again when we visit. Thank you Miguel 😊"

Group trip","The house was gorgeous, clean and very cozy. They had done some room updates since the pictures we saw online when booking. They no longer have twin beds in one room which now has a full size bed and moved the sofa sleeper to the master. It still all worked out for our group. We only had a few issues. The master bedroom ceiling fan and light were on the one switch and we had to sleep with the light on the first night to be able to use the ceiling fan. I messaged Raul in the morning and he messaged back it was in the cabinet above the fridge. All good for the next night!! The next issue was we were a party of 6 and only were provided 3 wash clothes. There were plenty of towels and floor towels in the master closet, just missing out on wash clothes, this would only be the negative of the trip. Overall the house is spectacular inside and out. The outside could have used a mow. But we were gambling or eating out, so didn't get to enjoy the patio. We will definitely book here again!!"

A heads up that was a negative for our group of 4, and that you should be aware of before renting is that at least during our rental (printed in the rules and policies) you can not flush your toilet paper. It is the only reason I would not rent there in the future. If that is not an issue for you or your group, it is a recommended."

Stayed a few nights","This was the cutest Airbnb ever! Not only was it cheaper than staying at the casino hotel it was super close and was so much better than a hotel room. The fridge kept our drinks nice and cold and there was plenty of room to play board games, microwave some food and get ready in the morning. The host were really great when the batteries on the remote died they brought them right away. This was one of the most relaxing getaways I've ever had and we will definitely be back to try the Green Room next. There's not much to do in the town but if you plan on going to the casino this is the perfect place for you."

Unsure of what to expect but when we opened the door to the Blue cabin and walked inside it was pure satisfaction. The cleanliness, detail in everything was exquisite and chic. The cabin on its own invites you in. We had a question in regards to the WiFi and our host immediately responded to the message. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a cozy get away whether it be for just one to two. We definitely will be staying here again. We were part of a large group celebrating a birthday whom rented the house and all of us being able to spend the time here together privately was appreciative. Also we watched a beautiful sunset as we sat outside on the front porch. Thank you for a great and perfect weekend getaway."

Stayed with a pet","This place is very CLEAN and nice, master bedroom king bed very comfortable, only thing I wish was they had blackout curtains, cause I like it dark when sleeping.. other than that all was great ! Very spacious and big dining table for all to eat and great breakfast table and kitchen.. Steven left us some bottled waters in the fridge. Some popcorn if you wanted to make in the microwave oven, so overall they are very accommodating. Very responsive to your text. Denise will go out of her way to try to help you out with whatever you may need. I liked that there’s a carport for your car so the sun is not beating down on it and also that the house has a gate all the way around even in the front that also locks at night so nobody can drive into the driveway. Neighborhood looked beautiful pretty peaceful. I didn’t experience any thing negative there, I felt really safe and secure"

There are some beautiful plants and flowers outside. There is also a dining table and chairs outside to relax under the covered driveway. I had inquired with Gustavo about a BBQ pit, and he mentioned there was one available and it was along with a new bag of charcoal. This was extremely nice of them, and it made our experience so much better. Inside the home there are 3 big rooms with 2 huge beds and one standard one. There were two restrooms in the house, one in the master bedroom and one in the hall between the other two rooms. It was very beneficial having two restrooms which were clean. The kitchen was perfect along with a small dining table to eat breakfast. With a gated property I felt safe. If If you are thinking about staying in Eagle Pass this is the place to stay in. The house is minutes from the casino!"

One small downfall was no hand soap or shampoo , conditioner , or body wash available unfortunately. We forgot ours. But we did have dawn dish soap. Which fix the hand soap issue. The AC unit was amazing. Room for nice & cold & slept well. Thank you!"

Stayed a few nights","When I checked in the house was very hot, I tried to lower the small air cons but they were programmed not to be changed and stayed set at 81. Temp. Outside was 103 so house was very warm indoors. House was self remodeled so restroom was an ad-on with no vents and was very hot at the back of the house. The fence was made with chicken wire and not very secure, which made me feel very insecure at night. When I checked in I wanted to contact Airbnb and complain and wanted my money back to stay somewhere else. But my husband was tired from travel and told me it was too late.
I don’t believe you should publish this feedback. This is My experience and you should deal with this type of Airbnb listing. I do not want you to list my name. It was a very bad experience for us. I will never stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","We had a fantastic experience during our stay at this Airbnb. From the moment we arrived, we were impressed by how clean and well-maintained the space was. The attention to detail was evident, and it truly felt like a home away from home. I think we need clearer instruction on how to get to and find the Airbnb that was my only issue but that was more so because we drove in at 2 am we could not call the host to ask for clearer instructions.
The host was incredibly attentive and made sure we had everything we needed throughout our stay.
Overall, we couldn't have asked for a better stay. The combination of a clean and comfortable space along with a caring and attentive host made our trip truly memorable. We would highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a top-notch accommodation experience."

And I felt an extra measure of security since the studio apartment was a converted building in the fenced in backyard of the street-facing main house.

Stayed a few nights","Quaint very well decorated super cute space. Secluded courtyard with a pool and very comfortable casita rental. We were very impressed with the beach/water vibe and the attention to detail. We were immediately comfortable in the space as we relaxed in the pool and grilled in the courtyard. Lush grass and tropical vibe trees and themed statues in the private garden .
We affectionately named this place ""The Sophia House"" and will recommend to anyone we know traveling there.
Highly recommend for a couple visiting the border, we easily walked across to Piedras Negras Mexico to shop and eat. Felt very safe and the locals were very accommodating. Walking distance to local family owned Mexican food restaurants and Main st entertainment with live music and dancing clubs. Don't sleep on eagle pass, we made a road trip out of it stopping at the Frio River."

Stayed one night","Cute little guest house in the rear of the yard with a nice little pool and yard between. Easy to find the place which was right off the main road.
The negative… I booked the listing due to the first photo which advertised the swimming pool as the main attraction with a nice yard and patio furniture. Sadly, I didn’t get to enjoy any of it because 6 teenagers were celebrating the entire evening. Upon reporting the unexpected guests to the host she apologized and said her niece and friends were not supposed to be there but were celebrating high school graduation. I responded that I understood, remember being that age and thanked her for quickly responding and addressing the situation so that myself and my guest could do what we came to do, use the amenities advertised… Instead our host did not ask her niece and their friends to leave and told me they would be gone in a few hours (by 9 pm) which was not at all an appropriate response!
Pro tip, customers want to use what they paid for!"

Stayed one night","What a perfect little Casita! I adored this spotlessly clean, comfortable and well-stocked studio and would have loved to stay longer. It is in a cool neighborhood too, which has stunning homes that appear to be from the 1800s. The location is fantastic, only 3 minutes from the bridge and close to great restaurants. I spent the day working outside at Silver Spoon; I really enjoyed chatting with the staff there and their delicious food and drinks. I had no idea Eagle Pass would be so charming. I hope to get back soon and highly recommend this fabulous Airbnb."
