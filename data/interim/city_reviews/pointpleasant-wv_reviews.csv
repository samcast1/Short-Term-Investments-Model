Stayed a few nights",We originally scheduled for April and had to move up our stay due to a very sick parent. Johnnie was responsive and caring. We came to Ohio and found a safe haven to unwind and relax. The house was equipped with all we needed. Johnnie was flexible when my daughter asked to come last minute. We are so appreciative to have been able to stay there. The house was warm and well decorated. Original wood floors were beautiful and a view of the river and Canadian geese while sitting having coffee with family was worth every penny.

Stayed a few nights","My first AirBnB experience. I don’t even know that the photos did this home justice, honestly. It was just delightful and perfect. Everything (basics) you needed - was there. Clean and adorable. Out back had a tremendous amount of property, private back porch, hot tub with a beautiful view of the river coupled with a grill and firepit. Entry was a breeze and the host was very prompt and polite with directions and responses. Just lovely to get away and honestly, I will likely go back because of this experience. Bonus that during the holidays Galopolis has their lights at the city park - which are stunning and not far from the home. 10/10. Thank you all for being such amazing hosts!"

I would definitely recommend going across the river to Point Pleasant West Virginia, where there are a lot of interesting points of history. Another great point of interest is the Ohio River Scenic Byway. And if you love pizza, you must try Lorobi's."

House was clean and well appointed. Great views watching the barges pass by on the river. Quiet location while we were there. Beds were comfortable and hot tub was a nice bonus. Recommendation if staying, bring bottled water. This is no fault of the owner but the city water was so cloudy it almost looked like it was mixed with milk."

Stayed a few nights","I'll preface this by saying that Gallipolis, Ohio might not rank high on the ""places to stay"" list...but that being said, if you are interested in the strange events that surrounded Point Pleasant, West Virginia in the late 1960s, you want to stay here– and you want to stay at this AirBnB. The sleepy city that claims fame to the Mothman, the ""Men in Black"" and the Silver Bridge collapse can be seen directly across the river from your back patio and the river itself lulls you into sleep. The cottage itself was exceptionally clean and the hosts incredibly responsive with communication. I would recommend Johnnie and his riverside cottage to anyone!"

The best part was sitting out back enjoying the river view and looking over at Point Pleasant, WV. Plenty of options for eating out, grocery stores, etc. in the area. 10 minutes drive to see everything Moth Man in Point Pleasant. We found the neighborhood to be quiet, safe and serene.

The home was VERY clean and well stocked, we felt at home immediately! They
included all kinds of entertainment options (lots of games, Netflix, Hulu, ect) for your stay which was really thoughtful!
It rained a lot while we were there but the hot tub is covered so that didn'tdamper our trip any!
Already thinking ab when we can come back.
((We were nervous bc a previous guest mentioning it is an ""industrial area"" but we honestly felt that wasn't a good representation at all. Yes there's a few businesses within a short distance of the home but they never once interfered with our vacation in any way. And if you're inside or outback you'd never even know))
This isn't a secluded cabin in the woods, its an awesome cabin get away on the river and we couldn't have been happier with our stay."

Stayed a few nights","A very nice, 2 bedroom, 1 bath house with a covered patio. We enjoyed having breakfast on the patio.
Overall, this is a very nice place. We will strongly consider coming back.
The kitchen is well stocked and well organized. The bed was comfortable. The decor was cute with a nice lakehouse / riverhouse theme. The TV had a variety of local stations and streaming services.
There were a few minor things that only made this a 4 star rental. Most importantly, the air return for the airconditioning was EXTREMELY noisy. The bathroom had some strange lights that matched the brightness of the time of day; they were off at night (odd for a night light) and couldn't be turned off during the day. Finally, we had expected actual river access from the property. The property had a wide lawn leading up to the riverbank, but the actual riverbank was covered with weeds."

If your looking for a nice fishing spot this place has it. It was great to walk out the back patio and have the water at our fingertips. It was a plus to have a nice sitting area with a grill and fire pit. We couldn’t have asked for a better experience. I would highly recommend this property."

We arrived after 5pm, lady was still cleaning house, host suggested we drive to WV to get something to eat even tho we rented house with kitchen instead of hotel. You will pay a $60 cleaning fee and still be expected to wash dishes, clean floors, strip beds, take out trash before leaving. Wondering what the cleaning person does for $60 after we get up an hour early to clean before leaving."

Stayed one night","Although downtown, it was very quiet. No problem with on street parking. Met the guests in the downstairs apartment who had grown up in Point Pleasant and they gave us local history of the house. They had gone to their dentist there. Love old houses. Modern heating and the rooms were toasty! Peaceful stay."

This place was conveniently located near downtown. Check in/check out was easy.
The hosts even came by to visit us during our stay to see if we needed anything.
We appreciated the snacks and waters that were left for us.
Would definitely come back and refer anyone to this lovely place."

Stayed a few nights","The place is beautifully decorated With a very British styled flavor. The bed was extremely comfortable. Bob was very friendly and helpful with suggestions for questions for things to see and do in the area, Even though I had lived here for 4 years during high school, and still have family in the area, he still gave me some suggestions that I wouldn't have otherwise known about. I'm giving 5 stars in nearly every category. The only reason I gave 4 stars in the price area is because it may be a little high for the area, but then again all air B&B's are getting more expensive these days than they probably should, so I can't really say too much about that.
All in all I would highly recommend this place and would stay again."

Plenty of towels for our bathing needs, and lots of throw blankets if you need to cover up a little. The decor was so cute, I loved it! We were visiting family in the next town over and these online pics looked a lot cleaner than the hotel pics in the area. We are accustomed to renting NC beach houses where the renter has to provide everything from sheets and towels, paper towels/toilet paper, hand soap. It was so nice to already have these items available and cut down on our packing. Definitely recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","I grew up in Pomeroy, OH. My husband moved there in high school. Since leaving in 1972, we have often visited to see family. We also lived nearby in Athens for over 10 years. We always wondered what it would be like to ""live above the stores"" on Pomeroy's Front Street; this was our first opportunity to try it. We had a great time.
The apartment is as beautiful in person as it is online. The kitchen is well equipped, the beds comfy, and the bathroom roomy. The large balcony overlooking the Ohio River was a real bonus. Our host Kevin was easy to contact.
We had several family and friends stop by for a ""look see"" and they were all interested in renting The River Sirens for visiting family members or simply a fun weekend away from home.
We enjoyed several meals prepared in the kitchen, but definitely recommend River Roasters a block away for coffee, breakfast and lunch.
Be sure you have strong legs for the long 2-story set of stairs. We are in our 70's and managed fine."

There are easter eggs located thruout the house that suprise you when you notice them.
I will not tell, it will be fun to find these little details that are in plain view if you see them and unnoticable if you do not.
The only concern I could see if traveling with other couples instead of family is the ""Large Bedroom"" has no privicy.
the doors do not close and stay shut, and there is just a curtain on the other door to the kitchen.
This is an older home with great hospitality. It was a very enjoyable stay.

Group trip",This rental was even better than we expected. The neighborhood was quiet. We could walk to everywhere. Access to the river walk park was just a block away. The adorable Mothman and such “Kitch” decorations added just the perfect touch of whimsy and local fun lore. The front porch swing is perfect for enjoying a morning cup of tea or just relaxing. We will be back!

Stayed with kids","The Home was easy to find and had a great view of the river. The ac was out during our stay. The host had ac tech come out. Ac needed a new part. My disabled mom has a heart condition. Home was 83 at night.
Host offered us $100.00 in exchange for a 4 star review. I declined. There were no functioning lights in the primary bathroom.. The water in the shower gets scalding hot burnt my skin. The water in the hot tub came through the floor and leaked into the hall in the game room. Host said is born
There was a dead mouse.
After bringing everything up to host he said we had more guests than we had included in the original booking and a pet. We had guests that visited the air b and b and we adopted a puppy while we were there. His property says pet friendly.
The host was waiting for us at the home the day before check out. He told us to vacate the property. I told him we have no place to go. He called the police on us. They came and said there was nothing they could do."

Stayed with kids","I'm struggling to write a review. I feel as though the host, for whatever reason, just didn't have enough time to adequately prepare for our arrival. I'm convinced everything that was provided (shampoo, conditioner, snacks, etc.) was left over from the last guest. My experience was much different than every other review and I'm sure the issues me and my family had are the exception. The house is super close to everything cool in Point Pleasant. We were staying here while we toured Monster Museums (Mothman, of course, but also The Flatwood Monster, Grafton, & etc.) We were so excited and ultimately let down with this part of our adventure. Communication with the host was lacking, and the wood floors, area rugs, and bathroom were filthy. Hair all over the bed and the bathroom as well. HOWEVER, the host was quick to offer a refund and rectify the situation monetarily without any hesitation. I greatly appreciated that. We didn't have a great experience but we're clearly in the minority."

The kitchen was especially useful, the smart tv had every option possible, and the bed was very comfortable. Only tips-would bring a sleep mask since the bedroom will be bright in the morning, and one of the mornings there was a garbage truck pickup of a dumpster behind the apartment so maybe earplugs if that rolls through. We heard nothing from the main road though. Some of the bathroom fixtures are also loose but ultimately functional. Great proximity to downtown Point Pleasant and Gallipolis and she is very responsive! All in all we had a great stay!"

It was clean and the bed was unbelievably comfy. I am a bad sleeper and I slept straight through the night while I was there. The hosts are so very kind and we arrived to a backyard filled with deer and wild turkeys. My son loved it and we even got a short visit from Hank, the owner's lovable and sweet Lab.

Stayed a few nights","We really can’t be more grateful. This house was perfect and EXACTLY what we needed for our anniversary getaway. I don’t think I can complain about anything and the communication was spot on. Our usual anniversary spot was booked and so we had tried to find a dog friendly place that was close to hiking and was private/quiet. You house was immaculate, had plentiful kitchen amenities and dog supplies (dog blankets for the couch, poop bags, treats, bowls and towels to wipe paws!) as well as an enormous deck with gates on each end so we didn't have to worry about the dogs escaping! Nicole was wonderful at communication and promptly answered any questions we had as well as checking in to make sure we were having a perfect stay. I appreciated the guidebook she made about the area and things to do/places to eat and well written, clear instructions for checking out, including the option to leave any leftover kitchen supplies/food for the next guests so it wouldn't go to waste. (Normally, this might sketch me out but since it was clear that this wasn't just forgotten stuff, like condiments, I appreciated it!). The area was located about 15-20 minutes away from town down a beautiful country road and the leaves were all starting to change. Behind the house is the firepit which we didn't use but look very inviting and a nice size yard in front of the house and beside it. Our dogs loved to play ball and sniff all the new smells in the yard but also wander around on the deck watching the deer in the woods behind the house. We didn't see any cows in the nearby pastures but heard them and the coyotes at nighttime. My only suggestion is to check out hours for local spots like coffee shops, wineries and restaurants. We hit up Twisted Winery Saturday night and it was awesome with great wine and live music as well as several fire pits and heat lamps for the cold evening, but the other winery was closed at 6 and the following two days were there. No big deal as we spent the following day hiking but in a smaller town, definitely check hours. But that's really the only thing that isn't even negative, just a tip!
This house and hosts are definitely 5 plus stars and have set the bar high for future airbnbs we visit. Thank you again, you will NOT be disappointed if you book this house!"

The home is spacious with an amazing back deck on the house. Everyone could spread out and read a book or we could come together in the living room to watch a movie and didn't feel cramped. The kitchen was great for prepping and making meals. Nicole was the perfect hostess and made sure we arrived safely, as well as checked in via the Airbnb app to see if we needed anything. The house was also a nice place for my dog. The fenced in deck allowed her to roam but I didn't have to worry about her wandering off. Nicole also had treats for my pup to make her feel welcomed too! If you are looking for an amazing get away to just reconnect with friends and also have some personal time, this was a perfect spot and I highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","There are no words to describe how lovely and amazing this Airbnb is, it’s one of the most well-equipped homes my husband and I have ever visited. If you can think of it, it's probably already provided, from full size bathroom necessities to fully loaded kitchen items, including spices, cooking oils, and every kitchen appliance and cooking accessory you would need. It was as if we stepped into our own home. The home is exceptionally clean and inviting. The outdoor patio's, yes that's plural, there are two decks, an upper deck with ceiling fan, lighting, outdoor grill, glider chairs and more and a lower deck, plus an outdoor firepit area with chairs. We stayed here in the summer and spent 98% of our time sitting outside on the fabulous deck listening to nature, because there are no other noises to be heard! It is the most peaceful place we've stayed. No barking dogs, no noisy neighbors, no cars! only grazing deer and hopping bunnies. Now that I've just scraped the surface on how nice the home is, the check-in and check-out are extremely easy, you're provided a code to the door so you're not on a time schedule to meet with someone to get checked in. Now, let's talk about the host Nicole. She is fabulous, it's no wonder she is a Super host!! She made an unbelievable accommodation for us which we couldn't thank her enough for. She was only a text message away from anything you would need or questions you would have, she is very gracious and thoughtful. If it was possible to give this getaway retreat a 10 star I would, because 5 stars just doesn't seem to be enough. You'll be missing out if you don't book this location, especially if you're looking for cleanliness, comfort, peace and quiet and a serene, wooded view!"

Stayed about a week","What a special find! We chose the home because it looked beautiful and welcoming with enough space for our needs. What we didn't know was that we were surrounded by sounds of nature and the countryside. We loved watching the cows on their daily walks and listening to them. The woods gave us much to enjoy, too, including birds, a chipmunk, coyotes, turkey vultures, and deer, not to mention the peaceful sounds of a tree or nut falling now and then. The Amish neighbors passing by almost daily made us feel connected to the community.
The home was extremely clean and inviting. The beds were very comfortable, with extra pillows and blankets. The kitchen was fully stocked. Little things here and there added to the feeling that the hosts really wanted us to feel at home and welcome. For instance, there were yard toys for little ones and grilling supplies and fire supplies for adults.
We've stayed in many AirBnb's and can happily say we've had a good experience every time. However, this place was the cream of the crop. Do yourself a favor and stay here. We'll definitely be back when time and schedules allow."

It was a great setup for two friends meeting up as each end of the house has bedroom(s) and bathroom. Nicole was very quick to respond to any questions. We had a wonderful time and would definitely return if we are in the area!

Stayed a few nights",We’ve been working in the area and had stayed in several Airbnb’s before finding “The Runaway Retreat” and I wish we’d found it sooner. It’s a perfect place to relax and having WiFi available was a big leg up over other comparable options I’ve been able to find. Everything was perfect.

Stayed with kids",Nicole is a gift! Our stay was so serene and peaceful. We left feeling rejuvenated and relaxed. Nicole messaged us when we arrived late because Chicago traffic had been delayed and answered any question we had promptly. The WiFi was super fast and reliable. The beds were comfortable and clean. The location is close enough to things you might need but remote enough to unplug and rejuvenate! Would highly recommend it! Our toddler daughter enjoyed the puzzles and books.

The house is just the perfect layout. So much space for a family and the back deck is just the icing on the cake. So much time spent watching the wildlife. Fire pit out back for s’mores and all the amenities you would need and want for one night or more. The WiFi was also very strong to relax and watch any of our streaming services in the evening. We will definitely be back!!

Whether you're wanting to roast marshmallows around a fire pit while enjoying the outdoors or vegging out in front of the TV with the whole family, this stay will work for you! Nicole is a great communicator and has clearly put in a ton of work to make her stay very comfortable and relaxing. Definitely will be visiting the next time we need some family time!"

It's very peaceful back there. The home is exceptionally well cared for , decorated, and equipped. We also found plenty to do in nearby Gallipolis, one of the initial towns created as part of the Northwest Territory. If you're looking for a place to unwind, this is it. Nicole is an outstanding host, and we enjoyed our exchanges with her. We'd gladly stay here again!"

Stayed over a week","My husband and I stayed here for an entire month.
Pros: The house is set up perfect for long stays. It was easy just to come and unpack, allot of hangers in the closet and empty drawers. Plenty of storage in every room. Kitchen was fully stocked for any meal you may want to cook. The bed was very, very comfortable. The house stays cozy with central air. We work from home and zoom all day and had zero issues with the WiFi or TV app streaming. The house is very well kept, a lawn service comes every week to mow and the yard looks soo good with the fresh lines. The washer and dryer are just flawless, they have been added to my wishlist. The shower has the best water pressure ever, as someone who is 5’1 with long hair this is the dream shower. Nicole is excellent with communication and you can tell she genuinely cares about your experience. Check in was easy, we arrived to a spotless house, and a basket of snacks (i happily attacked). The couch is comfy and even has a USB port for cell phone charging while you lounge. The porch was just soo great, fully furnished to enjoy the space. We loved the rocking chairs.
Cons: Gravel road, stirs up allot of dust.
Long story short, book it! And make sure you visit poppy’s coffee shop in downtown Gallipolis and take a stroll through the park along the river! :)"

Tucked away in an idyllic valley with a beautiful wooded hill and a stream behind it, this is a perfect peaceful retreat. The decor is lovely, and the house is full of thoughtful touches that make it an exceptional stay, such as gates on the roomy deck to keep little ones safe, dimmer switches on the lights, a fully equipped kitchen, a beautiful work space/desk area, wonderfully cozy beds and linens, tea and coffee and snacks available when we arrived...you will feel welcomed and pampered when you stay here. The house was immaculately clean. Communication with the host was excellent, and she checked in during our stay to be sure we had everything we needed. If I could go higher than 5-stars, I would!"

The kitchen is fully stocked for all your cooking/baking needs. The beds are very comfortable. The furnishings and decor make you feel relaxed and at home. The home is very clean. It is in the middle of cow country, so very isolated. This was very nice for us because one of our guests is extremely immune compromised, so we felt very safe and relaxed. The low moo from neighboring cows was just so sweet. We saw plenty of deer on the back hill, and listened to birds. The area is beautiful and just peaceful. If you have children, the outlets have safety plugs, there are toys and books in the bunk room, and also a potty seat. The yard is perfect with space to play and a fire pit. I highly recommend Nicole's place! She is also very prompt with responses and incredibly helpful! We will be back!"

Stayed with kids","This has been our favorite property/stay so far out of many. The house sits on a beautiful property. You can hear the stream in the backyard and see beautiful sunsets. The layout allowed enough space and room for everyone to have space without being on top of each other. The wrap around porch has baby gates built in and allows you to sit and enjoy being outside with your LOs and not worrying. The vibe of the house is filled with so much love and so calming. The washer and dryer were great to have when you have a child with you. The walk in shower was a perfect touch! The beds are so comfy we ordered one for our house on day 2!
Nicole was easy to get in touch with and checked in multiple times to make sure we were doing ok and didn’t need anything. She was an amazing host and I can’t wait to visit again!
(I will add I know it says low signal, I have AT&T and never had any issues. My husband has Verizon and although he had a few spots that would drop down to 1-2bars he always was able to use his phone as well.)"

MIDDLEPORT/POMEROY
Folks, this is one of those forgotten, and shockingly beautiful little corners of creation. Birdsong, like you will not believe because of the abundant water, woodlands and rocky cliffs guarding this special place, and her good People.
So peaceful. No traffic noise - just birdsong everywhere you go. Walk along the excellent bike path in the morning, and it's so calm that you will hear a cock crow on the far side of the truly majestic Ohio River (which has its own energy).
Do not miss the Old Post Office, with its CLARA FASANO SCULPTURE on the interior south wall.
See the world's cutest, and cheeriest little CARNEGIE LIBRARY steps from your door.
Amazing LOCAL BARBEQUE a block away. ...everywhere you go, you'll find genuinely welcoming local People.

Stayed one night","This is an absolutely lovely place, larger than I was expecting. The interior is very well-considered, with some clever shelving/lighting solutions embedded in the whole bunk bed setup. It's easy to find, and easy to get in and out of. The whole pond/kayak setup was a lovely little bonus (though the water's pretty murky -- there's a reason the listing mentions kayaking and fishing but not swimming).
Just be warned that some cows may wander by to yell at you from behind their fence. :-)
Fabulous experience, definitely recommended. If we're in the area overnight again, this will be the first place we look to for accommodations."

Group trip","Our stay at this home was very nice. The beds and sofa were comfortable. The house has been maintained well and was clean throughout.
The neighborhood is peaceful. The house is located on a dead end street, therefore there was little traffic. The town has a beautiful downtown area with a large park overlooking the Ohio river. We were visited by some deer in the backyard twice.
The only downside to the whole stay was the amount of furniture available in the living room/TV area. There is one sofa that seats 3 people and a desk chair. We had 6 people in our group, so two people had to bring chairs in from the dining room. I would recommend the host purchase two sitting chairs for the living room to serve the maximum amount of guests. The living room is spacious enough to accommodate the additional seating.
All in all, we enjoyed our stay and had a great time in the area. We are planning to return next year."

Group trip","Home was on a steep incline, but still a beautiful home. our GPS Maps app sent us in the wrong way (via an exit I believe), but we managed.
Home was so clean and with plenty of rooms and closet space available for a family of 5 (3 beds total, plus couch), plus two bathrooms with showers made things easy. The kitchen was very clean and we enjoyed heating up our food and making our coffee, plus a working fridge + freezer. TV was available and we enjoyed some streaming. There was also space outside to sit and relax. Laundry room was available, although we didn't use.
Parking space outside the house was plenty for our pickup truck."

Stayed with kids","This place was a great option for our group of close friends to get together. The back yard was relaxing in the mornings and it was great to have a listing that has rooms with beds for 6 rather than beds for 4 and then a couch or pull out for the rest.
There are a few rooms that we didn’t find any use for, but we were only there for a single day. Maybe you could let younger kids play in them to keep the noise down in the living room and bedrooms.
Do note that the house is located at the top of a rather steep hill, so come prepared if your vehicle struggles with that.
Rajesh was very friendly and accommodated requests of ours.
Bathrooms were clean and having 2 full bathrooms for 3 bedrooms was nice. Both of the bathrooms are in the general space instead of one in the master bedroom.
Half of the backyard is a pretty steep hill (the half by the house is flat).
Not sure if it was pictured, but there is a play set in the backyard as well.
Overall, great stay for the price.
Worked out for us"

Stayed a few nights","One thing to note - the house is located on a very steep hill and the first time I drove up I bottomed out my car. Everything was completely as shown in the listing - except that there was a camera by the front door. I stayed with a group of four and we really liked this house. It's in a beautiful area and the living room window has a gorgeous view of the woods. I would bring a white noise machine for sleeping, because otherwise you'll hear every creak from the bed. We cooked dinner the first night and there were pots, pans, salt, pepper, a whole spice rack, silverware, plates, and more provided. We couldn't find a can opener, so that's something to bring. The light in the hallway is terrible. It is dim and did practically nothing whether it was on or off. The bedrooms were all a nice size with storage plus extra blankets. The bathrooms were nice. It was a good stay and I recommend it."

Communication with Denise was great and the cabin is well stocked. She has added plenty of additional touches for forgetful travelers as well as interesting and helpful information regarding certain local Lepidopteran phenomena. (If you visit the statue at night - which you should - be sure to use the flash when you take pictures for the full glowing-eyed effect!)
The marked trail to a little pond was an added nice touch. We walked down in the morning before we checked out and it was nice to stretch our legs before getting back in the car.
Would definitely stay here again!"

Not only is the cabin family friendly but she integrates some of the lore of the area seamlessly with fun themes & games for the whole family.
Visited during winter (just passing by on a road trip from Texas to Michigan), I had just had knee surgery and everything was in its place and easy to find, Denise keeps the cabin well equipped and with plenty of water, other essentials and even keeps nicely packed ingredients so you can make roasted marshmallows and so much more.
Decor is great, it feels like a lived in space, love the frog themes throughout.
Your car will be safe from elements and wildlife with the handy car port!
If you’re into Mothman and other WV cryptid lore, this is definitely the place to visit, super close to Downtown Point Pleasant while still feeling like being out in the wilderness."

Stayed a few nights","What can I say about this wonderful cabin, and Denise - fantastic! Abso-bloody-lutely bob on!
When Denise found out why I was making the trip to the States, she was so protective and made sure I had her as a point of contact over there. What a diamond of a woman. She even left me a little gift to cheer me up after having my belongings stolen right at the start of my trip in South Carolina. So making the drive up to WV with my boyfriend, knowing this cabin was waiting for us was the fresh start we needed to our vacation, and it was the perfect choice.
The cabin itself is so cozy and spacious at the same time. Lots of little goodies to spot around the place, and the 'Emergency Mothballs' made me laugh way more than they should have! It's so peaceful and quiet, comfy bed and furniture. Wonderful fully functioning kitchen. Outside is gorgeous. Sitting on the back porch at night just listening and watching was an experience I'll never forget. Thank you so much for having us over. Much love"

Clean, cute, lots of extras from the host in case you forgot anything, really had everything to make your stay cozy and not have to think about too much but having a relaxing time. Had a grill and firepit, which we used nightly. Lots of wildlife to observe. The hummingbirds were so cool. This was one of the best little trips we took so far. 7+ hour drive was worth every minute and definitely worth the cost of the stay & trip. Denise is an excellent host!

Frazier's Cabin is absolutely wonderful, inside and out! It has everything you need for a relaxing getaway. I really dug all of the cute little cryptid things peppered around the place! We enjoyed seeing all of the birds, bunnies, squirrels and deer from the back porch. I walked the trail to the pond, and saw a family of eight turkey (six were babies)!
The location of the cabin is close to everything and easy to get to/from. If you are at all into cryptid things, hit the Mothman Museum downtown and find time to check out the tnt igloos. Very cool stuff! And if you're into American history, there are a lot of points of interest downtown. Point Pleasant really is the place ""where history meets mystery ""!
I definitely recommend Frazier's Cabin and plan to return in the future! Absolutely loved it!"

The hosts are very generous with amenities and extras! The cabin is cozy and had everything we needed and more! The view was great. The deer come right up to the back deck! We enjoyed drinking coffee in the morning and watching the deer amble around as the fog rolled in. Perfect! 🌄"

The grocery store Piggly Wiggly has cheap prices on food, steaks, etc compared to where we live in Louisville Ky. The host was quick in replying back to our messages. The cabin is well stocked of supplies, kitchen, bath, etc. We really loved the cabin and will definitely stay again. 5+ stars. Thanks so much for allowing us to stay in your cabin.

Stayed a few nights","If you are looking for a relaxing stay, this is the place. Frazier's cabin is quiet little place off the main drag, no traffic, just nature. Yet it is still close enough to Point Pleasant to enjoy the local sights. There is so much to see in the surrounding area. Not only the famous Mothman and the ""Bunker"" but interesting historic moments in our country's history. Be sure to enjoy the local diners and local pizza places, the food is great and the people are even better. After a day of taking in the sights we looked forward to returning to the cabin, it is so relaxing and inviting. We would sit on the deck (even in the rain, it is fully covered) with a warm or frosty beverage and watch the birds and deer. Denise has thought of everything, there is a fully stocked bathroom, laundry and kitchen with utensils and a full size refrigerator, stove and a microwave. There is a TV with a few local channels and a DVD player with a small library of movies or bring some of your own. She has a lot of information about local sights available with directions. Denise was extremely prompt and helpful with answers to a question that we had. She has everything taken care of for the weary traveler. I would highly recommend Denise and Frazier's Cabin if you are in the Pount Pleasant area."

Stayed a few nights","We stayed at Frazier's cabin over New Year's and LOVED it! Denise keeps the cabin clean and tidy, with lots of thoughtful details for her guests. It was wonderful to be surrounded by nature with the deer, squirrels, and birds right outside. We built a very cozy fire and enjoyed several movies that we found in the cabin's collection. It was a chilly weekend outside but we were toasty warm inside. The kitchen was fully stocked and even had a few ingredients that we forgot to bring. There's is a grocery store right down the road which had just about everything we needed. We enjoyed walking around the town and learning more about Mothman. (Although, if you're not fond of spooky stories, this may not be the town for you!) We had a view of rolling hills and deer, and I'm sure that summer foliage obscures the few neighbors that are visible from the back porch. All was quiet at night and we had a very peaceful stay. Thank you again, Denise, for all your hard work making our stay comfortable!"

It’s hard not to be reminded of the simple beauty of life when you’re surrounded by open country and more deer than you can count. The cabin was stocked with all the essentials you could possibly need, which made it feel extra cozy.
This was a solo trip for me - I was mainly looking to decompress, so I didn’t do much sightseeing. I did, however, check out the tnt bunkers, which I highly recommend. I can’t wait to come back and see what else the cute town of point pleasant has to offer, and I certainly hope to stay at Fraziers cabin when I do!"

They supplied snacks, bathroom supplies, a handful of movies, games, and lots of information about local spots and historical areas. We felt safe and warm. The local animals came to visit often, including deer, woodpeckers, and rabbits. The fire pit tied everything together at the end of each night. This cabin does not have wifi, and the service in the area can be spotty if you have AT&T. That wasn't a deterrent for enjoying ourselves, but for others it might be an issue. Other than that, we had no complaints!"

Such as cabin socks to wear and snuggly blankets hanging on the wall to use while you enjoyed the great DVD selections. We also found the pamphlets and tips about the local legends all around very useful.

Finding the cabin was a bit difficult as they said it would be when using GPS, but Chris was super easy to get a hold of and helped us within minutes to find the driveway. From the cabin it was a very simple drive into town, and there was the best Christmas light display I have ever seen! We ate at a Mexican restaurantwhich was good too. In the AM we got the breakfast we ordered delivered to our cabin, which was lovely. As we left there were 2 outdoor kitties that greeted us for our send-off. The inside of the cabin was simple, clean, and smells like wood, which is very nice! Just the right atmosphere for staying in a cabin on the river. There was hot water, plenty of shampoo & conditioner as well as bodywashes. I highly recommend this place!"

Our compliments to Gina who cooked the breakfast and delivered it to our cabin at a time set by us. WE would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to others. We also wanted to mention how comfortable the queen size bed was.
Thanks again Chris and Rebecca for a GREAT stay!

While it comfortably fit 3, 4 could easily fit on the bunk beds if the top bunk is used. There is also a loft bed that is good sized but the clearance is on the low side. All in all the space was great and the supplied breakfast was a nice added touch. Really enjoyed our stay here!"

The place is very clean, comfortable, and scenic. The breakfast served was excellent. This is about 20 minutes to the Mothman museum and tours. The trip back and forth includes beautiful scenary all along the river banks along the way. This place is like a postcard picture. If you are checking out the Point Pleasant area, this is the place to stay."

It was a great place for us to stay for a peaceful night and morning away from home. I loved that our hosts delivered us a freshly-cooked warm breakfast (and it was delicious!) included in the cost of our stay. The view from the porch was gorgeous; I think it would be even nicer when the weather is less hot and humid so you can take more advantage of sitting out on the porch looking out on the river. The hosts were very welcoming and warm and gave recommendations for where we could go for dinner in town (~20 mins drive away). Would definitely recommend this place for anyone who needs a peaceful retreat."

Stayed a few nights","This was a great stay for a couple; however, we look forward to bringing back the rest of the family to the larger cabin on property. The location and property were beautiful and a deal in themselves. The views will not disappoint. The hosts were responsive, timely, sincere, and created the best space to chill. The breakfast included in your stay is a MUST. The value is unbeatable, and you will most likely have leftovers. Inside the cabin, it was evident from the linens to the bathroom cleanliness that the property is well taken care of.
The only minor inconveniences were no dish soap and having one sink with minimal counter space/ no kitchen. This somewhat added to experience though and allowed us to explore the nearby town of Gallipolis for supplies. Gallipolis is also a must see. The townspeople made us feel very welcome. We made it a point to eat at the Shake Shoppe a few times because of the prices, food, and atmosphere. This was the vacation we needed!"

Also the breakfast, yum! Many options and huge portions. We visited Point Pleasant for the Mothman stuff and drove to Huntington and neither was terribly far.

If you visit in the winter, we highly recommend some cozy socks or slippers, but you'll be plenty warm otherwise! It's a little cabin; it heats up fast, and the bedding keeps you toasty! :) I would love to come back here, and I highly recommend spending a night or two yourself!"

But the restaurant was amazing! I have food allergies and they were able to make some amazing delicious food. They served a breakfast the next day. It comes with the cost. You definitely get your money’s worth. Their staff at the restaurant were very helpful and friendly."

The hosts are absolutely adorable and kind. They're immediately available since they live next door, but they won't interfere with your privacy. I had two very huge delicious breakfasts delivered to my door. I ate them on the deck with a fluffy kitty that came to visit. Wonderful place, I'll stay there again soon."

We didn't have time to relax on the patio, but we did get to use the firepit. My greatest complaints are that it seemed very easy for bugs to get inside (there were many ladybugs inside, and I also saw a few spiders) and the temperature inside was difficult to maintain how we wanted. The beds were very comfortable and the location was quiet, safe, and comforting."

We enjoyed our brief stay at Rebecca's place. Her husband and herself (and staff at the restaurant) were very hospitable. The food from the restaurant next door is made from scratch and was excellent.
They are building another cabin next door and there was a little bit of a construction feel to it, but the inside of the cabin was nice, with the smell of cedar panelling.
Having a home cooked breakfast, made to order, delivered to us in the morning was a great way to end the stay. We'd like to stay here if we make the same trip again"

Stayed one night","If you have landed on this listing - thank your lucky stars and don't hesitate to book. A wonderful cabin with a front porch overlooking the Ohio river - the sound of crickets and frogs fill the air and you'll sleep better than you have in ages. Wake up to a gorgeous sunrise and a genuine home-cooked breakfast. I had a veggie omelet with perfectly cooked fried potatoes and even if you opt for toast instead of a homemade biscuit, you'll do yourself a disservice if you don't slather it with their homemade apple butter. Rebecca and Chris are super hosts making sure you have everything you need - an intelligent, thoughtful couple (with a lovely daughter) who put their heart and soul into this slice of heaven. If you don't stay the night but are merely passing through, at least stop for a meal at Bladen Landing Restaurant. I hope the locals know what a treasure they've got in their backyard. HIGHLY recommend."

It was also so handy to have it delivered right to the cabin door. We got dinner on our second night, since we enjoyed breakfast so much and we were not disappointed! We stayed 2 days, and had no problems with anything, the lack of TV/wifi was a nice reset for us, they offer games in the cabin we mostly just sat and watched the river. It rained a good bit of our stay so we didn't get to enjoy the fire pit area, but it looked cozy. If we are back through this way again, we would stay here again!"

It was also a good vantage point for the changeless natural world that in July that meant fireflies dancing up the bank and the chorus of crickets and katydids at night. The next morning the show began with a remarkable full country breakfast delivered to the door, extending the feeling of a true vacation another day. Dinner at The Landing Restaurant the night before was a treat, too."

Highlights:
- The friendliness of the owner and the other two women who were working at the restaurant.
- A delicious dinner enjoyed at the restaurant, and then the included breakfast the next morning. (SO good... ""The best waffles I've ever had,"" said my daughter.)
- We were greeted by several friendly cats which my kids spent a long time petting.
- The porch overlooking the Ohio River with beautiful views as the sun set.
- Easy to find and to check in.
Notes for other parents: The top bunk does not have guardrails and is pretty high. The ladder to get up there is a bit tricky. It's not ideal for younger kids.
We look forward to stopping here again next time we drive this route!"

We came into town for the Mothman Festival, and this locationwas perfect, close enough to the town to get to the fest early, but far enough away to enjoy peaceful and quiet nights out on the porch.
We thoroughly enjoyed sitting on the porch and meeting the deer family with their babies who came through to graze, and after dark the stars were phenomenal. We saw the brightes shooting star of our lives.

Bobbi was very flexible prior to my arrival, and I greatly appreciated that. I wasn't expecting to be greeted by deer when I arrived in the early morning hours, which startled me. The apartment was very clean and made me feel right at home. I loved all the amenities that were provided (frig, microwave, stove, oven, kettle, variety of teas, body wash, shampoo, conditioner, smart TV, luggage rack, rack for hanging clothes, hangers...)...it had everything I needed! There's a little table in the corner which I used to do some work when I wasn't at my son's dorm or Walmart. I do want to point out that the deadbolt was a bit sticky trying to lock and unlock, so you just have to play around with it to make sure the door is properly locked. Other than that, I loved it and would definitely stay here again!"

I can't say enough good things about this experience. BTW that deer greeted me in the morning. Made my day. I will be back."

Stayed a few nights","We loved our stay! The place is very clean, comfy, well-equipped, and just as pictured. Check-in/out was really easy. Bobbi is also extremely responsive and communicative as a host, and provided a great list of recommendations for local places to eat or visit. It is conveniently located within walking distance to the University of Rio Grande campus or a quick drive to Gallipolis or Point Pleasant, so a great option for anyone visiting people or attending an event in those areas. The location feels very quiet and peaceful- my city-boy husband was excited to catch a view of some deer grazing on the hillside behind the place! I would definitely check if the place is available next time we are traveling back to the area."

Stayed a few nights",We really enjoyed our stay. We came to visit family and friends and wanted a place close to them. The space was bigger than what the website shows. It is very well laid out and was spotless. The parking was easy. We took a nice walk on the college grounds across the street. There is the original Bob Evans Farm very nearby. It has good food and has interesting things to see on the grounds. There is a Family Dollar down the street if you forgot to pack something as I did. The amenities were perfect. Our hosts were very friendly and available and we would love to book here again.

Stayed one night",I really enjoyed my stay here. Bobbi's place is very peaceful. I needed to get on the road somewhat early on my day of departure and stepped outside only to see a mother dear and her fawn up on the ridge. It was just daylight and was a peaceful start to my day. I would enjoy staying here again!
