Stayed with a pet","The host was very responsive and helpful throughout the process. The home is very cute, clean, and comfortable. It is close enough to downtown Midland to walk. There is parking in the driveway. The thermostat is adjustable so you can control it to meet your personal preferences. Dogs allowed and I have a large, well-behaved dog, so that worked well for us. There is an apartment above so if someone is there, you will hear them. Didn't bother me at all but if you are super sensitive to exterior noise, you should know that. I would recommend and would certainly stay again in the future."

Stayed with kids","Lori’s place is small and simple. It’s a walking distance from downtown Midland, Dow Gardens, and more. The place is very very clean, the kitchen is well equipped, Lori leaves everything extra, in oppose to most airbnbs. We had an extra set of sheets, plenty of towels, soap, toilet paper rolls , and paper towels. The only one little issue we had was the soft mattress in the queen bed. We ended up sleeping in the sofa bed in the living room which has an air mattress that we could inflate until it was hard enough. The laundry room was convenient and the little back yard can be nice if you visit during the summer. Lori is friendly and quick to respond."

The host (Kevin) was very responsive to any of our questions/concerns. The neighborhood has wonderful tree canopies, with cute and upkept historic stylish houses. Just driving in this area is beautiful, much less to talk a walk. This is our first stay at this duplex and it will not be the last.
I have traveled to Midland since 2009 and have stayed at different hotels in this area. This duplex is a lot better than getting a hotel (more room and saving money since hotel rates have gone up in this area). And, this is also our first time using Airbnb, and we were not let down."

The duplex is very clean and completely stocked with towels and linens and very nicely decorated. Should you need to do laundry there is a washer and dryer available.
The duplex location makes for easy access by car or foot to downtown Midland and the various family run shops and restaurants. In the summer month's you can take in a Midland Loons baseball game as it makes for a wonderful evening.
The next time I am back in the Midland area I will definitely check on the availability of the duplex before considering any of the local hotels."

We did not have the chance to enjoy his beautiful back porch which is enclosed but stood out there in awe!!! The neighborhood is very nice and quiet!!!
In one of his units he has this statue in the kitchen where he writes ""Welcome (your name)"" on it. Just a special touch. The fireplace which is in unit 10 is perfect for a nice relaxing evening as you unwind from your day!!
His units are top notch and you will not regret making your reservations with Kevin.
By the way, I am an AIRBNB Host also, so I know what I am looking for and Kevin has it all!!!! That's why he is a ""SUPERHOST""
Thank you Kevin and hope to come through again!!"

This would be a great place for two couples to share since it is a duplex with a shared and beautiful 4 season room off the back. Two friends rented the other side and the 4 season room offered a lovely place to relax and spend time together. Bedroom and bathroom were small but provided just what we needed and wanted. Our stay was much more relaxing than what it would have been at a hotel. Kevin was very personable. He was accessible and responded quickly to our questions. Will definitely be contacting him the next time we come to Midland!

The Purple side of the duplex is immaculate and comfy, he could give Joanna Gaines or Martha Stewart a run for their money as interior decorators. The bed was ultra comfy for me, I slept like soundly. There is a 3 seasons room to the back that would serve great during the warmer times of the year. I'm definitely looking forward to another trip and seeing how the other side of the duplex matches up!"

The space is immaculately clean and beautifully decorated. The neighbourhood is quiet and we felt completely safe there. We went on a nice walk. I would highly recommend this listing.

The tv, most of the channels do no work or come in at bad receptions so if recommend bringing something to connect to the tv to have better tv options. It was full of kitchen dishes and pans if needed. There was no trash can I could find which was weird and inconvenient. The bed is comfortable. The location is great. Quiet neighborhood. I’d return here again overall and would recommend it"

Stayed a few nights","Very clean and beautifully decorated house, a few blocks from the beloved Dow Garden, Kevin’s place is a perfect weekend getaway for a party of two. The high speed Internet allows an instant connection to the world from this cozy house in a very quiet, well maintained single family house neighborhood. Kitchen is small but has the perfect ambiance for a nice meal for two. The sunroom is right next to the kitchen, offers plenty of leg room for us to relax. The backyard is pretty secluded, surrounded by nice trees with birds chirping in them. No coffee grinder but Kevin provided fresh ground coffee and they are very good! Kevin is on the top of the communication and has answers to all questions within a few minutes! He has also been meticulous at informing us about the arrival of the guests renting the other side of the duplex and that was very helpful for us to know when and what to expect. We have truly enjoyed our stay and definitely consider to come back!"

Stayed one night","Very nice place near Dow Gardens, excellent value for the money. It's a half duplex. Driveway, sunroom, and basement (which we didn't enter) are all shared. The kitchen window looks into the sunroom so it is a tiny bit disconcerting even if you don't see the other unit's tenant. Good WiFi. Lots of closet and drawer space. Bathroom is very small but has all you need. A/C in bedroom only, might be an issue in very hot weather. Desk area in living room AND bedroom which is really nice. We barely used the kitchen but it seemed very well equipped. Outdoor space is lovely and you cannot beat the location. It was perfect for a quick trip to visit friends and Dow Gardens. Great value for the money spent."

We were a little surprised opening the curtain off the kitchen to see the other apartments tenant sitting outside our window in this area but only because we didn’t know that area was there until we looked, I do find it necessary to explain that for future bookings. With that being said we really enjoyed our stay here. My boyfriend went to a concert at Soaring Eagle, it was a straight and easy drive getting there. We would stay again."

The duplex itself is super clean, inviting, and nicely furnished. We instantly felt at home. Plenty of dishes, utensils and towels. The awesome water pressure in the shower and comfortable bed were greatly appreciated after trekking Dow Garden/Whiting Forest in the rain! The sunroom and rear yard are shared with the other side, but it wasn’t an issue for us. They were an added bonus to an already excellent spot. Very relaxing - we really enjoyed our stay!"

Stayed a few nights","What a great space. My husband had to give a talk at a conference at the H hotel and all the rooms were booked. This worked out perfectly. In fact, I am glad I didn’t have to sit in a hotel room trying to connect to their WiFi in a small space. I was able to work remotely in the wonderful sunroom. Kevin’s response to our late request to stay 3 nights the night before our arrival was immediate. He was so kind, I locked myself out early in the am and he was over immediately to let me in. I left my purse after checking out and he was very accommodating to let us back in to get it. The yard is landscaped so you almost do not see your neighbors. Check in was easy. There is no TV but we don’t usually watch a lot of tv anyway.
If you need 3 pronged plugs they are in kitchen and sunroom but the bedroom has a power strip with adapter if you need/ want to work in the living room. The neighborhood was quiet and felt very safe. We were less than a mile from Main Street, restaurants shops. If we ever find ourselves in Midland again we would definitely stay here again. Thank you again Kevin"

We loved the nice big kitchen, family rooms, fun things like the ping-pong table in the basement, and the super comfy beds. We had 5 adults in our group, but this place would be wonderful for families with kids too.
Sue has decorated the house beautifully. It's in a lovely neighborhood, with a private, charming backyardyard. We enjoyed sitting on the back porch every night. The house is located in a quiet, private neighborhood but still close to many nice restaurants and stores like Walmart and Meijer.
Sue was such a doll of a host. Her communication from the beginning was friendly and very helpful. We come to Midland every summer for a weekend, and we hope to stay at Sue's place next year.
If you're planning a trip to Midland, I highly recommend Sue's Airbnb. You won't be disappointed."

The entire house was very well-equipped for our family to relax, cook, and host a family lunch while we were in town. The hosts were incredibly fast to respond when we had questions and offered us a ton of things above and beyond the listing description to make our stay more comfortable, including use of the outside smoker and some pantry staples to save us from buying extra groceries for our relatively short stay. The location was perfect—centrally located in an extremely quiet neighbourhood. The beds were also very comfortable and the house was very clean. This is an example of a listing that is actually better than the photos and description. We hope to return next time we are in town! Thanks for your hospitality and kindness."

At the same time, there weren't too many decorations, which is a consideration for our family since we have a toddler and infant. The toddler can be grabby, but it wasn't an issue. Also, the rooms had enough space so that we could setup a pack n play in each room. The location was great. There was a dog somewhere next door, but it wasn't loud enough to be a bother. The host is very thoughtful and provides bathroom supplies (complimentary loofa, toothbrush, etc) and sets up a bonfire. She went the extra mile and we loved it!"

The beds were comfortable but a bit noisy at night when we moved. But super cozy and we slept good!
The kitchen is big and well stocked. The fridge is big and works great! We also did laundry while we were here and It was perfect. Helped us stay ahead of laundry while we traveled.
Great stay all around! Good street to walk out dogs too. Thank you!"

The owner adds some nice touches with waters, a few snacks, and also a few toiletries if you lost your luggage. I’ve been in many Airbnb and this is one of the best. I think the owner travels a lot, and know exactly what any guest would want.
100% recommend this rental from easy check in, nicely renovated house, fantastic communication, and plenty of parking."

The space is exactly as advertised and absolutely perfect. Nice and cool during the hot weather and almost too cozy and warm during the cold weather. Everything you could possibly need during your stay is already here, as I’m used to needing to bring my own trash bags and other things yet didn’t need any of it here. Located extremely close to anything and everything you could need from groceries to laundry services. The hosts went above and beyond to always be available to answer questions and offer assistance in many ways, like offering to clean all dirty linens each week. I will be recommending this listing to absolutely anyone who is looking in the future and if I’m ever in the area again will not hesitate to book with them again."

I like to journal and there was the perfect small desk as well. In addition, I was arriving late and host helped with a request of mine to have ice made for my ankle after play. Very responsive and recommended a fantastic coffee shop I used as well. There are two studio apartments and I liked them equally at different stays. Bed was cozy for me. Definitely will stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a very nice place, and the owners were very accommodating in letting us book last-minute. Heads up for others, the A/C is a fan unit located in one of the windows, which is loud when on, but we didn't mind. It was a bit of a challenge to keep the temperature controlled during the night mid-summer, but it worked. We loved the general decor and feel of the place. It was very well-supplied in the kitchen and bathroom. The Castile soap in the shower was new to us, but as people who like to use non-sulfate shampoo, it was an unexpected treat. One final note, as a heads up to others, there is a painting of a nude lady hanging in the bathroom."

Stayed one night","Quiet house, comfortable sheets. Easy to find with lit-up reindeer, Xmas tree in the yard.
For my mid-February visit, the room temperature was quite warm. I shut the heat vent and opened the window.
Some of the photos show all the ""girly stuff."" Be careful walking in with your bag! Figurines, toys, stuffed animals, a doll bunk bed, a hobby horse ... and an embroidered sampler with a single date, implying that this room is a tribute to a lost child. :'(
The bathroom is a tribute to MSU football.
Downstairs was Xmas in February. A lit-up tree with no apparent power switch, wall decorations, jars and dishes of Xmas candy, Halloween candy, tins of nuts, snacks that may be purchased. Keurig coffees: more sweet, donut shop flavors
Be careful in the tub: large bottles of product are precariously placed.
Wifi password: on a sign on the floor by the other BR.
The room is upstairs, a long flight, and the handrail is placed very tight to the wall."

When my plans changed a few days later and I found myself back in Midland, I looked to see whether the bedroom on Plumtree Lane was available, and then stayed two more nights. That's about as strong a recommendation as I can make: Offered the chance to stay under her roof again, I happily did so."

Her family was there & nice. It is a firm but comfortable single bed, with nice pillows. Big window overlooking the neighborhood. Shared bathroom nearby. Room is located on the 2nd floor. Cynthia privided a folder with local recommendations to dine, work out etc. I was just in town to visit Dow Garden & meetup with a friend, who ended up not being able to meet, but Midland is a friendly mini city so everyone I came across was friendly and it was nice being by myself actually for a night!!!

Stayed a few nights","Pictures are true and place is clean, which is about the only good thing about this place. I was supposed to stay here for an extended stay, but was told I might need to find another place within 10 minutes of checking in. Cynthia’s kids wanted to visit but won’t because they don’t want guests due to Covid. So the conversation of staying or not staying kept happening over the course of a couple of days, implying that I need to leave. There’s really not that many places in Midland in general anyways, so finding an extended stay at the last minute is very inconvenient and you lose out on extended stay discounts. If you want to find someone who loves to talk about politics and someone who could talk your head off, this is the place for you. Otherwise I would avoid this place."

Stayed a few nights","Really nice place to stay. They have a beautiful home. I really appreciated the attention to detail with the mint on the pillow, the local things to do guide, fresh bar of soap, the bottle of water and the granola bar."

Stayed a few nights","We had a wonderful stay at the Garden Guest House! It was clean, cozy, and cute! Jennifer and Patrick were extremely kind and responsive. The outside of the house is full of places to sit and enjoy the beautiful yard. It is close to almost everything you’d want to see in Midland, don’t forget to ask them for recommendations! We would definitely return. 😊"
