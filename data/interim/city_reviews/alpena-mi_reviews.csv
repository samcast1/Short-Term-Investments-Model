Stayed with kids","Our family had a wonderful stay at Matthew’s place. Growing up visiting Alpena and surrounding areas, this location was spectacular to visit downtown. For a big family like ours, all of the essentials were there and then some. We were impressed by all the of little touches of hospitality (things for the kids, cooking supplies, fans, games, books, you name it, it was there). Matthew is also the most communicative host I’ve ever had, and we travel a lot. I felt like I could text him with any questions and he was responsive and thorough. We would stay here again!"

Stayed with a pet",This place was super. It was walkable to almost anything Alpena has to offer. The house was clean. I did have one small issue when first arriving and the host snapped into action and took care of it immediately. He even texted me advice on where to watch the northern lights that were coming one evening. We enjoyed our stay so much and would stay here again.

Stayed with a pet","Perfect little spot to relax! I came up to Alpena to visit some family & friends while teleworking during the day. Wifi was steady allowing me to work uninterrupted. Matthew was extremely proactive, the weather wasn’t the best during my stay, possible snow, and he made sure my mom and I were parked properly. My dog Paprika loved the backyard. There were so many supplies in the house, dedicated dog towels/blankets, kitchen utensils, even an Easter egg decorating kit for the holiday! The beds were extremely comfy, as well as the couch. 10/10 stay, will 100% rebook with Matthew if available next trip to Alpena"

Stayed with a pet","This little home away from home in Alpena is absolutely worth every penny. It’s nice and cozy, right by the water, and super close to town. The host Matthew made our stay by far the best Airbnb experience I have had to this day. He is extremely responsive and kind! Gave us local recommendations and made sure we had everything we needed to make our stay perfect. The space was very dog friendly and our four-legged baby loved the fenced in yard. We definitely would stay with Matthew again and highly recommend anyone considering staying with him!"

Stayed about a week","What a great home! Matthew was quick to respond to any of my needs. Plenty of parking. My wife and I drove separately so there was room for 2 vehicles in the driveway and room for more. We did not use the bedrooms upstairs but they are very large and well kept. The huge kitchen had all pots, pans, and utensils that we needed. A very nice family room with a couch, a large ottoman, and nicely placed LED TV. Just a wonderful home to relax in and enjoy!"

Stayed a few nights","We were very familiar with the area that this B and B is located, and it was just what we were looking for to get away for an extended weekend to visit our 1-year-old Great Granddaughter who lives nearby. We traveled up to Alpena from 5 hrs. away in Ohio. Not only was Matthew's place easy to find and matched exactly what was listed and expected, but Matthew's response times, his courteous nature, recommendations of activities and eateries, and most friendly demeaner were unmatched. It happened to be peak season for the fall colors so we could not have timed it any better for what is already a Lake Huron hot spot on its' own, regardless the time of year. There is so much to see and do in the area and this location puts you smack dab in the middle of it all. I would highly recommend Matthew's place to stay, as you will not be disappointed.
P.S. We do not have a dog, but very cool that this place goes out of its way to ensure your best friend is Welcome and feels right at Home! BONUS!"

Stayed with a pet","Best AirBNB experience to date! All necessities required for a wonderful stay are 5-star…cleanliness, comfort, amenities, location, etc. This place has anything that you could possibly need whether you’re a couple, a family with children of any age or, in our case, traveling with a dog. Don’t worry if you forget to pack something…chances are you’ll find it there! Finally, the efforts of our host to make, not only our stay, but my husband’s 60th birthday, so special, were simply extraordinary! In addition to a personalized greeting card welcoming us both, a birthday card was left for my husband with a generous gift card. If that wasn’t already well beyond our expectations, Matt came by with a very nice cigar for my husband. Thank you, Matt, for your thoughtfulness and treating your guests like family…you are a remarkable host! We love your place and can’t wait to visit again! Hope to see you soon…with better weather next time to enjoy the lovely patio and yard!! Cindy and Dave"

Stayed with kids","Matthew was very accomodating. He communicated well when we had questions. The home offered many things that were unexpected and provided a thoughtful process in providing things we might need. Such as a bottle of isoproply alcohol I forgot to pack, bandaids, etc. There were things we would not have needed but another family may require. Such a well-prepared home to meet all our needs as if we were staying in our own home. I especially enjoyed reading through the House Rules booklet. We were able to put out the trash from the home so it would not leave an odor.
The boys and I were putting together a puzzle that was available at the house. We hope to stay again next summer when we visit Alpena again!"

The house was very clean and included all the necessary amenities for our comfort. Communication was easy and always responsive. The things we look for in an Airbnb are value, pet-friendliness, cleanliness, proximity to area attractions and being in a safe environment. Metthew's place exceeded our expectations in each of these areas. We sincerely appreciate the warm hospitality and gracious generosity of our host!"

Group trip","Matthew was a great host. He was very kind, and helped us with any information and questions we needed in order to have a great stay. My friends and I were looking for a getaway before we walk for graduation at the end of the month and we are all glad we chose to stay here. The home was as pictured, with fully stocked kitchen, bathroom, etc. Everything you could think of and much more. The weather was accommodating so we were able to walk around the shops and sights of downtown Alpena. It was definitely worth waking up early in the morning to watch the sunrise, and even saw the Lunar eclipse one morning. We could tell Matthew really cares about trying to make sure his guests have a stress free and safe vacation and I would recommend this Air BnB to anyone who is deciding to travel to Alpena. Thank you so much Matthew for letting us stay with you !"

Stayed with a pet","Matthew has a beautiful place in a great location! He was ultra-responsive and proactive with recommendations via text for what to do on a colder day. By far one of the better hosts we have had.
Alpena is a great spot for a lot of different outdoor to-do’s. We were up there for our kids, 5 and 9 yo, spring break and wanted to go fossil collecting up at Rockport and on some of the area beaches. Knowing this, Matthew had recommendations ready and also had a couple of buckets ready for us to use.
5 star host!"

Stayed a few nights","So glad we had a chance to stay at this gem! The home is clean and Matthew went above and beyond to make our stay great. He even thinks of the little things like providing a picnic basket and blanket to use. There's a whole section of beach towels, outdoor kid toys, animal bowls and toys... just things you may not have thought or had room to pack but make you feel right at home. Matthew is a great communicator and has some good restaurant suggestions. I would also add The Nest and RBs are great places to eat! The beds were clean and comfortable, and we had everything we needed provided at the home. His cleaners even found something of our son's that had slipped between the couch cushions and he mailed it home for us, he just went above and beyond even after we left to make everything about our stay with him amazing."

Stayed with a pet","This was my first Airbnb and i wasnt sure what to expect when actually arriving and seeing the place. The photos were very accurate to what was listed and seeing it in person was even more suprising with how clean and well kept everything was!
It felt so nice to bring my two dogs and not have any worries since they prepare for dogs if they come along ( AMAZING THE THINGS THEY HAD ON HAND FOR THAT!!! )
I am from alpena so i know the area very well and felt very safe being there as its in a nice quiet block but also close to any store or the beautiful lake and beaches. Cant wait to book again in the summer time!
Matthew was so responsive and kept everything in the driveway for the winter time safe and clear of snow! I had a few family members visit since they live in alpena and they were impressed as well and also thought the price was very affordable and they will be recommending their family members to book this home as well :-)"

Stayed with a pet","This place definitely lives up to the super host rating.💕The home was easy to find and access especially when we came in and it was dark. The utility room entrance is very nice and accessible for pets as well. Everything was nice and cozy, immaculately clean with many amenities should you forget something. Matthew is thoughtful was very responsive and kind to think of pets; providing extra pet waste bags if you run out and designated towels and blankets to help keep your fur babies comfortable and clean.
The dog run is such an amazing feature our pups loved it, it was also easy to access from the patio and the fencing was very sturdy and well maintained as was the landscaping.
It’s also within walking distance to the heart of downtown and you can literally see the water from the east facing windows.
Don’t miss out on this one if your thinking about it book it!!!"

We felt right at home as soon as we got there. Matthew paid attention to details and gave us some suggestions for things to do besides the plans we already had, which was the sleigh ride at Thunder Bay resort. I highly recommend this ride too. You get to see elk and have a great dinner in the woods.
I will be happy to recommend this home."

We were in town for a family funeral and with a lack of pet friendly hotels this was perfect for us! Great outdoor fence space for our fur babies as well as a pet friendly home. Thank you so much for making this a painless and comfortable stay! Would highly recommend! I will also add that it is directly across the street from the lake so in the summer this property would an amazing place to stay for lake fun!"

Stayed a few nights","Matthew's place was in a great location in Alpena - close to US 23, the lake, and other things to do in Alpena. It's very comfortable as well and had everything that we needed. Finally it was very clean - we didn't even notice any stains or smells from previous pet guests (we didn't have any pets with us on this trip, but it looks like a great place for pets!)
Also, Matthew is a really good host. He made extra efforts to communicate and provide us with a good experience and left personal notes to make us feel welcome.
One thing that wasn't super clear to me when I booked - there is an attached structure in the back of the house that I think is Matthew's residence when in town. We were a little confused at first, but it didn't affect the rest of our stay at all (the entrances are completely separate so still private). Just think that would be helpful to clarify :)"

Stayed with a pet","I chose this house specifically because of the rule allowing pets. I was in Alpena to visit my husband who is training at the local CRTC. I needed a place to stay that allowed my large 100lb+ dog. Matt's house was extremely clean and it was actually even more than what I needed. There is a master bedroom on the first floor which i used and 2 upstairs bedrooms. Because I was traveling with a work obligation, I needed a remote work area. The upstairs bedroom seemed to get the best wifi. You can tell this host takes pride in their home and making sure everything is perfect. I would highly recommend this House to anyone ! also there is a nearby Starbucks- it's win win !"

Stayed with a pet","We had such a fabulous stay at Matthew’s home in Alpena. Check-in was easy, we were greeted with such a nice welcome note, and the house was impeccably clean. The host thought of everything we could have needed, including anything our dogs needed. The fully fenced backyard was wonderful and my dogs loved it! We also loved that the house is within walking distance of downtown and several waterfront parks. It’s a quiet neighborhood and it was the perfect atmosphere for us to relax in. I can’t think of a single thing the hosts could have done better. We hope to be back again!"

Stayed with a pet","Really cool family friendly place! House is open and inviting. Loved the welcome sign! As a family, we appreciated not having to haul along large items for baby as pack n play and highchair were provided upon request ;-). Loved the close proximity to beaches and the thoughtful personal touches/items provided for beach, kids, and dog. If you can think of it, this home likely has it (i.e. q-tips in the medicine cabinet and SHOUT stain remover). Loved the recycle cans! Neighborhood is pretty quiet. If you like taking walks on any of the paths at the nearby parks, watch out for the goose poop. Great home and great stay, thank you!"

He does a wonderful job keeping the house clean and stocked with any supplies you could possibly need.

I reserved this place for work as I was tired of hotels and this place was so much nicer to come back to rather than a plain hotel room. Matt, the host, is great and very easy to communicate with. The house has everything you need and even things you might not think you need as it is well stocked beyond the basics. Internet was excellent and high speed which is also used for the TV which is beyond what you would ever get at a hotel with various apps and premium channels. I loved the grill and firepit and if I brought my wife and dogs I know they would have enjoyed it, especially the big backyard for the dogs. I will definitely look to stay here again in the future if my travel schedule and availability work out."

The location is great as it is very close to the beach and restaurants within a short drive or a longer walk. The neighbors were friendly. When we stayed there was construction on the street, but we were still able to park in front of the house. Although we didn't use the grill, fire pit, or patio it was nicely set up and would be wonderful. I was impressed with the baskets of supplies for dogs, the beach, and children. The fenced in yards were convenient for letting our dog play in a safe place. We brought our dog crate, and it easily fit in the living room without being in the way. The provided dog blankets meant our pup could sit on the couch with us just like she does at home. When we go back to visit Alpena, we will definitely stay here if it's available."

Our stay was comfortable, and cozy. The space is beautifully decorated in its simplicity while also organized, functional, and clean. It was prepared with all the little extras you might need—spices, toiletries, beach towels, good-quality pots and pans, games, toys, etc. The beds were super comfortable and we slept well. There was plenty of room for our little boys to play, and the space was decorated minimally so they could play (respectfully) without fear of breaking some special trinket. We played a lot of hide and seek—the house has great closets for it! Matt and his family have done an absolutely wonderful job making the place feel like home. Matt was quick to respond to any of our questions. He is very approachable, thoughtful, and conscientious. Check in was easy. We can’t wait until we can stay there again soon and visit our beloved Alpena."

There are few Airbnb’s that go to that extent to make people’s trips that much more comfortable. Home and kitchen were fully equipped with everything from spices, toiletries if you forgot any and blankets. Home was very, very clean. We were within walking distance from downtown, wonderful coffee shops, restaurants and stores. Lake Huron was directly across the street. Matt was awesome with communication and provided us great hiking recommendations, firewood and s’more supplies for a bonfire. We were sad to leave! Can’t wait to come back in the summer!!"

Stayed with kids",The house is cozy and very clean. Nice personal welcome note and had s’mores supplies new and ready for us to have a campfire! The sound of the waves crashing sitting next to the fire was magical- even on a cold winter night. Any questions we had were answered immediately throughout and we couldnt be happier with our stay. Cant wait for the next trip!

We stayed for a month doing remote work and enjoyed the space, fire pit, big fenced backyard for our dog, and well equipped kitchen. Easy walking distance to the several coffee shops, restaurants, bars downtown. Matt was very quick to respond to all our questions and a great host."

Stayed over a week","Staying at Matt’s beautiful home in Alpena was the single best Airbnb experience I have had to date. As a young professional looking to stay in Alpena for a month for work, I did my homework beforehand. Matt’s place offered the most in terms of amenities and location (very close to downtown and the beach), all within a reasonable price range. There was even an outdoor patio area complete with a firepit and grill! The best part was having a HUGE fenced in yard for my two doggos to run around in!! The place was very clean upon arrival and Matt always went above and beyond to respond to any needs or questions I had during my stay. Alpena is a beautiful city with much to offer in terms of outdoor activities and small town charm. I've already booked my next trip to Alpena with Matt and I recommend you do the same! ;)"

Included tons of informational brochures about Alpena which I found incredibly helpful. Lots of extras, like chocolates, portable beach chairs and towels, coffee for the AM. Had everything you needed for cookware too. Plus a comfortable space to work. Felt very safe. Enjoyed the higher view. Only critics I have are that I could definitely hear the folks next door through the walls, and it was a bit odd that there was no bathroom door on the master suite (the bedroom itself has a door of course, and the guest half bath in the front also has one). Just minor things worth mentioning in case that matters to someone, but overall a great stay. I would recommend it."

Stayed a few nights","We booked Chad's place after we decided to shorten our 30th anniversary trip. (My husband bought me a pool for my birthday two weeks before, so we needed to downsize our trip.) We found Chad's place while searching along the northeast coast of Michigan. We knew nothing about Alpena, but Chad's listing caused us to pause and check it out a bit. After a few minutes of searching, we decided that Alpena had a few interesting things to do and booked the apartment.
Alpena is almost like a Hallmark movie village, and Chad’s place is right in the middle of it all. We were able to walk to the grocery store, walk to the park by the lake, walk to dinner several nights at a variety of places, walk to cute shops, walk to the sunken ship tour boat, and bike to the sand beach a short distance south of the downtown area. It was an easy and beautiful drive to Presque Isle where we biked to both lighthouses and hiked at Thompson’s State Park. We also visited Rockport State Park and hiked in the quarry.
Check-in was easy. The apartment had a code for the door. When we walked in, we were greeted by 12-foot ceilings and an immaculately clean space. The kitchen, dining, and living room areas are open and surrounded by tall windows with blinds for privacy. The kitchen had everything we needed to make breakfast each morning. The bedroom and master bath are spacious. The bathroom has a shower with two shower heads and fluffy, soft towels. The queen bed is so comfortable!!!
Chad had excellent communication and left brochures and maps to help us find our way around. We were in town for really only two short days and three nights, but we packed in so much and really enjoyed ourselves, the apartment, and Alpena. We will definitely be back!"

What really stood out was the cleanliness of the home and the endless number of added amenities. We didn't get to enjoy the provided Smores kit as we were too busy enjoying hiking and exploring area. House was truly pet friendly with provided dog dishes, yard stakes for teether, dog toys, treats and even towels meant for the dog. House had everything to fully enjoy and was decorated to make my family feel at home. Pete was very responsive in communications, and it was obvious he wants you to enjoy your stay. Will stay again in the future as we have family in the area."

To say it was pet friendly is an understatement, there's a great yard for the dog and they included towels and dishes for the pets. The sprinkles of added value throughout the house were such a charming touch, coffee, snacks, even a smores kit! I would highly recommend this over a hotel if you're heading to Alpena, it's a MUCH better value! I can't thank Pete enough for the wonderful home he provided us while we were there."

It was located right in the heart of town so access to everything was very easy. The home was wonderfully stocked with little goodies, very clean and beautifully furnished. My daughter especially enjoyed playing the electric piano. Now we have to buy one for home. The beds are comfortable and the kitchen is adorable. It’s a delightful place to stay."

Stayed a few nights","Amazing host and wondeful house! It is seriously so cute!!! Definitely well staged! Jennie was extremely responsive and so easy to work with! I checked in quite late, as my flight was delayed and she went ahead and left the outside light on to make it easy for me to locate the house. That was just the beginning of the little extras that Jennie provided. The house had everything you could need from laundry detergent, ziploc bags, shampoo, coffee/tea, sugar, spices, etc. You literally only need to bring what food you want as everything else was provided. Huge plus in my book! The house is in a great area and within walking distance to some shops and such. Highly recommend!! I look forward to renting from her again next time I'm in the area."

The only downfall was that my handicapped mom came with and we did not realize all the bedrooms were on the 2nd floor (I may have missed this somewhere though). But we would definitely stay again."

Stayed with a pet","The place was beautiful and peaceful with lots of activities available (indoor and out). As a family of 5 we found the cost was a bit high during “off season” as it was too cold to appreciate the many amenities (kayaking, outdoor fire pit etc) but it was definitely reasonably priced for larger families which it can easily accommodate 8 people and being able to have our fur child with us was definitely worth it. No regrets staying here, hosts were quick and easy to communicate with and the place was extremely well thought out and welcoming. Almost resort like. We travel to Alpena at least 2-3x per year and will definitely check if this rental is available when we do!!!"

First of all, the location was beautiful - so peaceful and serene and right on the water! There were two kayaks and two longboards available for our use and we absolutely loved our time out on the water - what a delight!
Emily’s home was well appointed with everything we needed and had a lot of very nice modern updates. There was plenty of space for our family to hangout - both inside and out! The swinging bench outside on one of the porches was also such a great touch. Home was also very clean and beds were comfortable.
Emily was also very communicative and responsive and accommodating of our needs throughout the stay!
Overall I would highly recommend a stay at Emily’s if you are in the Alpena area!"

Stayed a few nights","As usual, we had a wonderful stay. We have been to many Airbnb homes in the area and this one by far has been the best. Let me tell you about some things that my wife and I really like. First of all it is clean, and that is very important to us. The kitchen is spacious and equipped with all pots and pans and utensils you will need. The family room is one of my favorites. It is very large with two sofas and a flat screen TV. The bedroom mattresses are extremely comfortable. I have a bad back and it is pretty rare that I find mattresses as comfortable as these. One of the other things that I really like about the home is that it has forced air heat. Many of the homes in the area have baseboard heat and they take a long time to warm up. Forced air heat warms up quickly. Also, response time from the owner of the home is also important. If I do ever have a question, all I do is send a message to Melissa and she response within 30 minutes. Highly recommended, but it does book up quickly!🙂"

Stayed a few nights","Great location, great little house, quiet neighborhood. Very clean and well appointed. A coffee lover’s dream - there was a 12 cup drip coffee maker, two french presses, a coffee grinder, and both ground and whole bean coffee in the cupboards - as well as bagged tea and an electric tea kettle. Idk if that’s standard, but we appreciated it! Everything we needed for our weekend stay was at hand. We had a smashing breakfast at John Boy’s (definitely a hidden gem - the Giant Cinnamon Rolls were DIVINE), and sampled Mango’s Tequila Bar’s dinner (VERY tasty!!). Visited some of the Maritime Heritage Trail and Bay View Park. We packed a lot into our stay! Planning our next weekender already, and will definitely look to see if this home is available for our next visit."

Stayed with kids","Everything was as pictured and described. Prompt response to questions and concerns. Very well appointed and clean but not what I would consider immaculate. Beds were clean and comfortable. We happened to stay during a blizzard warning and inquired about snow removal - which they had but they didn't come until 9 pm when the blizzard warning was canceled at 4 am earlier that morning. Thankfully we had 4 wheel drive and a shovel to get out and drive the few blocks to get to a main road. I would definitely consider staying here again for the price and convenience. However, if you are sensitive to mold, there is one window in the kitchen that has not been replaced despite all the other updates, new windows and renovations - it had mold along sill. We noticed it when pulling the blinds down. The bathroom also had noticeable mold along the bathtub seal. We didn't notice a strong mold smell upon arrival but they had recently sprayed air freshener and we brought an air purifier from home."

Stayed a few nights","We really enjoyed staying at your home Esma. The family room was large with plenty of comfortable couches and chairs. One of the things we really noticed is how quickly It warmed up inside. With you having forced air instead of baseboard heat makes a big difference. The kitchen was clean and well stocked. The bedrooms were spacious, and the beds very comfortable. We also used your dryer in the basement and noticed that the floor was freshly painted and it was very clean. Every couple of months we come up to visit my daughter and her family who live in Lachine. We will definitely be back again.🙂"

There were so many thoughtful touches, like the stocked kitchen, including coffee which I forgot, so thanks for that! And little cosmetic items in the bathroom, electric conveniences in the bedrooms, and certainly the keyless option too. It’s much bigger than I anticipated, which was nice. Very tranquil, quiet neighborhood, and very easy to check in. Also the host was eager to help IF I needed it, which I didn’t! We back to visit this beautiful town in the future and will absolutely be recommending and staying at this home again. Thank you for such a great time!"

The kitchen was well stocked with spices, cookware, pans, coffee, and even Cholula and Tabasco sauce. The windows helped everything be bright and cheerful. The bed was comfortable with soft linens. The bathroom clean, towels nice and overall welcoming. We would definitely stay again.
Again, we really appreciated the late check out so that we could sleep in late, have a relaxing morning and big breakfast before we left.
Thanks for your hospitality and the use of your beautiful home!"

Stayed with kids",From the communication to the comfort of the home this location was fantastic all around. You can tell that the host takes great pride in every aspect of the hosting process. We were blown away by the cleanliness of the house and all of the updates that have clearly taken place in the home. The level of care that is taken with this house is something I think is rare in rentals like this. I would recommend this property and any others this host may have if they are even half as nice and well maintained as this one. Our little family felt so comfortable there and we’re very happy with our stay. Thank you Pete. Keep up the amazing work!

We attended an event held at the river near the museum, so walking there was also easy. The house is incredibly clean, beautifully decorated, and thoughtful touches for guests were much appreciated. We will for sure be booking here again next summer! Thanks for making it so easy and relaxing, Pete!"

Stayed a few nights","The first thing to come to my mind is that the Pike House is CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN!
Not a single hair or speck of dirt to be found. It has been completely renovated with new carpet/flooring, fresh paint and updated window treatments through out, and much more.
This home is very well organized and stocked with all the essentials. The ROKU TV was a plus. There was a nice little book collection to chose from as well. Night-Lights are provided. Bedrooms are equipped with window unit A/C. There is plenty of closet space with hangers. Super cute decor & style. No clutter.
The full sized washer and dryer came in handy. The kitchen has nice appliances and everything you need. Cleaning supplies available. Owners also provide you with a special Pike House blend from Hubbard Lake Coffee (full-size coffee maker) that we enjoyed every morning. You are within easy walking distance to downtown Alpena for shopping & dining. Lots of parking available downtown should you chose to drive. Felt very safe.
We were in town for the Annual Brown Trout Festival/Art on the Bay and were so thankful to have sunny, warm weather. Lake Huron is beautiful. The Pike House is a great value for your money when you see what the Holiday Inn Express is charging these days. Highly recommend."

Stayed a few nights","Pete and Isaac were very accommodating to my fellow guests and I. They provided us with all the necessary information, and had numerous resources for things to do, places to eat, etc. Something else that I appreciated was that they provided us with a list of emergency numbers in the area, which is not something I’d thought about until I read them. Definitely something you’d want to have in handy if you need them.
The house was spotless and much bigger than we actually thought it was. The interior was clean and we had more than enough space (there were three of us). We enjoyed settling in for the night after coming back home, every time.
Now, there were some areas of concern – though nothing to do with the house itself or the hosts. Firstly, something that we felt one should know is that the area this neighborhood is located in currently has a smell that permeates the town. This may not be relevant by the time one reads this review, but we stayed in April of 2022. We looked into it and discovered that the nearby factory has stockpiles of unused, decaying wood. We could not smell it on the inside of the house, but it was noticeable outside and at all times.
Secondly, without sounding too judgmental, the neighborhood that the property is located in, is what one might refer to as “sketchy.” There was very little light at night, and in the daytime we noticed several individuals that were behaving in concerning ways, with some potential drug use inferable from their behavior. We were not approached, but were careful to keep our distance. I will admit that at some points we did feel afraid of encountering an unwelcome character.
Once again, this has nothing to do with our hosts, or the house itself. We have nothing negative to say about them or the residence, this is just information about the area that one might like to know beforehand. Everything that was less than ideal was completely out of control of our hosts, it is simply information that we feel should be shared. We write this review not to disparage Pete or Isaac in any way, and are grateful to them for allowing us to enjoy their property. Aside from that, though, we really did enjoy our stay."

Response to any of my emails were timely. That being said, we didn't have any issues so our communication had to do with the courtesy of letting her know when we were checking in and when we were checking out. Real easy. it's been a pleasure staying with you!🙂✌️"

It was right on the main road which was convenient and the traffic was never an issue. We will definitely stay again!!

It had all the amenities to make us comfortable, including hooks on the doors and a laundry basket in the bathroom. It really is these little things that make a good place great and Tamy has done that here. My husband and my son both read parts of some books from her shelf and my daughter danced in the house constantly.
We enjoyed the area and walked to the beach/ park across the street for a little evening stroll every day. We were also a very close drive to downtown Alpena. We can’t wait to get back to Tamy’s house."

Stayed a few nights","A delightful little house a few minute's walk/drive from the center of Alpena. It's across the street from Lake Huron, and although you can't access the lake right across from the house, there are several little public parks along the road where you can. We used the house as a base for fossil and rock hunting on beaches in the area -- Presque Isle and Rockport State Recreation Area and other local beaches. There were just 2 of us, but room for many more! The house is charming. The shower is amazing! The kitchen has everything you would need to cook for yourself. There's a gas grill outside. The only thing that would normally be a deal breaker for me is the lack of usable outside space. There's a bench behind a small wall, but it's not really somewhere you'd want to hang out for long. That didn't matter at all to us as we were out all day. Tamy was wonderful -- texting with info and answering all my questions. 110% would come back."

The only downside, if there is one, in the front bedroom if you're a light sleeper it might be a little noisy because it's a heavily traveled road, but it didn't bother us."

Stayed a few nights","Most convenient location in the city. Decor is modern, with all the right touches. Everything is brand new. The bedding is very comfortable with cotton sheets and comforters. The living room is large with a lot of open space for gathering, while the bedrooms are closed off with a solid door for privacy. The kitchen is well equipped with every gadget (and more). The dining room table is a great place to gather and make food. Many condiments provided. The coffee provided is so good that we purchased more at their store adjacent to the house. White, fluffy towels are abundant, as well as striped beach towels to take to the beach. Camp chairs (5) are something that B&B's don't generally think of, but they were handy to take to the several picnics we had. They even have a large umbrella in case of rain. A large TV is in the living room, and lots of DVD's. We were able to use our Netflix and Amazon with the internet provided.
There is a full size washer and dryer, and lots of detergent. Having access to wash clothes is a bonus. And the bathroom and shower are very clean and the colors soothing to the eyes. Tamy really tries to get a ""spa-like"" feeling for the place. Bonus...one can book a massage right next door.
The only thing we regret about this stay is that we wish we were staying longer! We walked to every beach on State Street. There are so many cool things to do in Alpena, 5 days didn't cover what we wanted to see. This was the first trip to Michigan for my three cousins from Newfoundland, Canada. They originally booked a local hotel, but for a bit more, the three bedroom house was so much more enjoyable. They said it was the BEST vacation and BEST AirBnB reservation ever.
Tamy is a SuperHost and was quick to reply with any questions. This will be my first choice when booking AirBnb in Alpena. Thanks for the pleasant memories!"

Group trip","Tamy has truly thought of everything with this house. She stocked the place with so many helpful little things, from a first-aid kit and cotton balls to spices and cooking spray. Even an essential oil diffuser! The house is spacious with a great layout. We were there for a wedding with friends, and the place worked perfectly for a group. My only wish was for a second bathroom - with 5 people trying to get ready for the wedding at once, it was a little chaotic, but there's a big mirror in one of the bedrooms that helped with that. The view is beautiful, with only a few beach-front houses between this place and Lake Huron, and there are plenty of parks/beach areas within walking distance."

Stayed with kids","We had a wonderful stay here! Check-in was simple and straightforward. Tamy communicated with us to let us know the garage code ahead of time which was nice since we weren’t sure what time we would be arriving.
The home is an awesome 2 bedroom right across from Lake Huron! Everything was updated, comfortable, clean and beautiful! The windows all had nice curtains and blinds to control privacy and natural light. There were lamps and dimmer switches to adjust to our comfort. Coffee pot with delicious coffee was provided. The tap water was clean, cold and tasted great to drink (so unnecessary to bring bottled water like we often do when traveling). There were several board games, some books and magazines, shower essentials, and well-stocked kitchen utensils. The living room couch was so comfortable, great for relaxing!
We felt like this was a great value and would love to return soon!
The downtown area is just down the road which is where you want to go when visiting Alpena! So many fun shops and restaurants down there."

Stayed about a week","We had a wonderful eight-night stay at Tamy's welcoming, very clean and and open home in a great location. We appreciated having the spacious garage, front porch, and excellent location for an easy walk to the lake and charming downtown Alpena. The street can be noisy at times with traffic but it didn't bother us at all and things quiet at night. There is plenty of seating and the kitchen is large and well-stocked. Tamy has thought of everything a guest might need, leaves clear instructions and tips, and responds promptly. We really enjoyed walks around the interesting neighborhood with its varying styles of old houses, many with nice gardens. This was the perfect place to stay for a family wedding and extended getaway. Can't recommend it enough. Thank you, Tamy."

Stayed a few nights","Very spacious, beautifully updated, and quiet. While Tamy is not the only host to do so, I personally feel that asking guests to strip bedding etc when you pay a cleaning fee is too much. The cleaning fee is high enough that someone on vacation should not have to deal with this. in itself, I'd fully recommend this place, but feel the list of ""house chores"" can be too long... (Many might not mind having to put dishes in a dishwasher but many probably do not want to deal with having to fill detergent trays to run it and having to strip a bed and move garbage to a second garbage can before check-out...) I can see it cuts costs on the cleaning lady for the host, but that is why cleaning fees are paid..."

This home is situated in the midst of big, gorgeous homes, you must take some walks and not only enjoy the beach access it the beautifully crafted homes and their landscaping.

We were so thankful for the little things such as the drying rack, makeup towels, grocery bags, a small cooler bag, camp chairs for use at the beach, umbrella, etc. She also made sure to check in to see that everything was okay and also recommended some fun adventures for our family while we were there!

This is the third property I've vacationed at where Tamy is the host. This property, just like the other two properties, are spotless and well-stocked with anything you'd like in the kitchen. The gas range, microwave, and double door refrigerator, all updated, made everyone feel at home."

The best part was Jennie. I think it was the first time I ever truly felt like I was home in an Airbnb. She was so accommodating and quick to reply.

She had everything you need from toiletries, to extra phone chargers, even to water bottles in the fridge. I stayed here with another couple I am friends with and there was more than enough space for the 4 of us. The pictures do not do this place justice - it’s even cuter and more spacious in person."

Downtown is nearby and easily within walking distance while you still get to enjoy the peace and quiet of the suburbs in the evening. Also an extremely convenient location for exploring the natural beauty of the lakes and forests of the surrounding area. Highly recommended stay for that ""Up North"" experience."

Group trip","We had a great stay. We arrived very late in the day, and Jennie made sure the porch light was on so we could find the house. When you first walk in, it’s nice and open, the perfect spot to just drop all the bags after a long drive and grab a snack from the bowl right on the entry table.
Everything you need to prepare food in the kitchen, along with enough food to whip up something in a pinch. It’s only a few minutes from downtown. (Try out the happy hippie food truck nearby if you love tacos! )
The rooms are all spacious and nicely decorated. We brought our 3 teen girls with us. It was perfect to give them the upstairs to themselves. We loved that noise doesn’t travel between the levels."

Stayed a few nights","There are many good things to write about this place. It is spacious, in a fairly convenient location, and newly renovated. However, even after trying to air out the home over a couple of days, there was still a remnant smell of cigarette smoke through the home (despite their rule of no smoking on the premises). This was difficult for us as we are sensitive to odors. I’m sure there are many who will not be bothered by it, but those who are sensitive may wish to be aware. Otherwise it was quite a nice place. Communication was good, and the kitchen and furnishings were well thought out."

Stayed a few nights","Jennie was such an amazing host! She was incredibly accommodating and responsive to communication before and throughout our stay. For example, she dropped us a message via AirBnB when there was a local power outage just to see if everything was okay and if we needed anything (luckily, we were in a different part of town and were unaffected). She was also as accommodating/understanding to our schedule as possible, and allowed us a slightly earlier check-in and slightly later check-out; it may have been only an hour or two on either side, but honestly makes a world of difference. The house itself is an incredible value and is well-appointed. No amenities were lacking. The place was very clean when we arrived, and I was even impressed that the carpets seemed to have been professionally cleaned (it had those triangle patterns of any professionally cleaned carpet). The only super minor thing that I wished I knew before staying was that the ceilings upstairs were somewhat low; they are well-marked in multiple locations and our party was fortunately not a tall bunch, but could be something to consider if your group is on the taller side. It didn't impact our stay at all, though. The location was wonderful for our particular itinerary as nothing was more than 1 or so miles away from the place. Our party would very highly recommend anyone staying here for the value, location, and the incredible host experience."

My son had forgot his Iphone charger and there was a drawer of chargers to use! Loved the area. Visited the small beach on Blair street several times during our stay. Loved walking around the town and shopping.
Thank you Jeannie and Josh!"

We came to Alpena to snorkel shipwrecks and fell in love with the area. We can’t wait to return next summer and stay in the house again!"

Good kitchen set up - appliances are great. The upstairs’ ceilings are low but great space for kids or those less than 6 ft. Hosts were quickly responsive. All the lamps have usb outlets. Good WiFi.

Stayed one night","I would highly recommend this AirBnB! It was the last place we stayed after traveling on a road trip for 10 days. The home is spacious, clean, and comfy. There were only two of us, but this would also be a great stay for a group. There were many thoughtful touches and conveniences of home. There were snacks and bottled water. The kitchen was stocked with pots/pans, condiments, utensils, baggies, chargers, etc. The home is up-to-date and well decorated. The towels were good quality, and I really appreciated that there were two pillows for each person on the bed. It’s just a bummer when a stay has exactly two towels and one flat pillow per person. This was not the case here! There is a book with lots of helpful information, including many great local recommendations, which we followed and had a great experience at all. There’s a porch with seating and a yard with a picnic table. There’s a driveway to park in. The neighborhood is quiet and cute and nothing we wanted to do was more than a quick drive from the house. The communication is top notch, too! It was a wonderful stay! It’s exactly what I hope for with an AirBnB stay!"

Everything is updated and felt so inviting, and there were great personal touches to make us feel at home when we arrived. The location is great, a nice quiet neighborhood, but just a short walk downtown or to the beaches. There's a large secure back yard, perfect for kids, and for eating out. Overall this was a perfect spot for our Alpena getaway."

Jennie was fantastic with communication and made so many helpful recommendations. Our only dislike was there isn’t central air despite the listing saying there is AC. There is a small unit in the upstairs but with two box fans downstairs and windows open, the house still reached 80 degrees making the downstairs uncomfortable to sleep in."

Bottled water and goodies to welcome us to the home. Jennie was also very helpful with advice on places to visit and eat at. We enjoyed our stay."

She thought of all the details and missed NOTHING!! We were very comfortable and felt right at home during our entire stay in Alpena. The location of the house was a perfect distance from everything in town, much of which we used our bikes to get to. Our stay at Jennie’s house could not have been better and I highly recommend staying here!"
