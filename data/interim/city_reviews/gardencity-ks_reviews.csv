Stayed with a pet","Kade and Ellen's barn is my most favorite stay EVER ~ pictures cannot capture all the beauty!
The second I walked into the barn, I gasped at the wonderful smell!
Everything was pristine clean with soft linens and 5 star quality bedding. When you hop into the comfy beds, you'll once again smell the soft scent of the home.
My first night, it rained and I fell asleep listening to rain drops on a tin roof! The next morning, I enjoyed the sounds of happy birds as they dipped and dived in the nearby fields.
The cats are wonderful to watch and they are ""besties"" with the farm's fouls. But, it's the two working farm dogs I loved ~ they are friendly and will certainly greet you, but they are working to keep the farm animals (and guests) safe from the roving coyotes.
Kade and Ellen will make your stay absolutely perfect! Friendly, communicative, and just down right nice. Their family is simply darling and they go the extra mile just for you! Thank you so much for an awesome stay ❤️"

Stayed with a pet","We had an absolutely wonderful stay! We were in town from Colorado with our dog for the dog show and wanted to catch up with some friends who live in Kansas and this was the perfect place to meet up! The barn is out in the middle of the country, not very many amenities around so plan ahead and bring groceries and entertainment as needed - but can always make the drive to Dodge city. There is a large amount of open grass space to play corn hole and other provided yard games, grill and relax! The interior of the barn was fantastic - what a fun way to remodel a milking barn into a living space. We had a great trip and if ever back in Kansas would stay there again!
Ps the hosts even offered us fresh eggs from their chickens! The hosts are fantastic, extremely responsive and welcoming without being around too much either! (Host live in house on property away from barn)"

Stayed with kids","""The Barn"" is really nice. Very modern, updated and clean. The area is remote but quiet and tranquil.
The only issue we had was it was really hot upstairs. There were fans which we used but with one cooling system for both levels it is difficult in such high temperatures that we had to cool the upper rooms. If outdoor temperatures weren't so high I think it would probably have been fine."

We also really enjoyed being far away from any cities and feeling the peaceful ambiance of a farm setting. There are windmills all around which provided a charming flicker of light at night. We were here visiting family and would stay again if I have a future visit."

The furnishings are very nice and I would hope all families would treat this place with respect. The couch was comfy and my husband took the recliner. Our bed was warm and inviting and I would have loved to sleep late, but we had to leave early. Will stay again on our next trip."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I would return to this lodging “in a heartbeat” if we travel back to western Kansas/Dodge City. We indeed felt that we were briefly time traveling when we entered the front door of the hotel. The suite itself is a comfortable and spacious three rooms (including bath) with bookcases and soft oriental style carpets on old wood floor. At every reading area there is a lamp, both in the living room and bedroom. The sofa is long and looks new and welcoming for falling asleep reading on a rainy day. The climate control equipment worked well on a very hot summer day. There is great lighting in the bathroom also.
I appreciate good lighting and as these ceilings are exceptionally (such as 19th century) high this is important. Morning sun lights up the front room through lace curtains. There are privacy curtains for night. Quiet ceiling fan in the living room. The table in the eating area is perfect for computer work as well. Coffee for the Mr. Coffee, creamer, water in the fridge, and a small breakfast cake were much appreciated.
Owner Kathleen has been a steward of this remarkable property for decades and will share her knowledge of the 1886 hotel and all things Kansas. She is, as others have written, lovely and personable."

I needed a place to work out of for about 10 days and I travel with dogs for work. The hotel was everything I needed and more. It really felt magical staying in such a beautiful and historical inn. The apartment was spacious and cool even with weeks of over 100-degree heat. The bed is super comfortable and the couch is too. I was able to get a lot of work done in the space while I was there. My dogs felt like queens of the Cimarron Castle. Kathy is a serious dog-lover too. And the yards and grounds of the hotel are gorgeous. So much shade and green grass. I am hoping to return in the fall!

We didn’t plan to sleep in, however we did because the bed was so comfy. We went to the local bar and grill for carry out, and my partner had the chicken fried steak which is a must. We then got a nice Cabernet Sauvignon and enjoyed a glass while reading about the history of the place and browsing the books. I added some Chopin Nocturne for some ambient music while we unwound from the long drive behind us and the long drive ahead. Our dog loved Kathleen’s place and immediately took to napping after his supper and walk. He enjoys some Chopin as well. Kathleen has a very nice dog who greets the guests as they arrive. I would totally stay here again, as the place is cozy for the book lover, quiet, historical, and the hostess is inviting, and very lovely to talk to."

Stayed one night","We had a nice stay at Kathleen’s in Cimarron, Kansas.
It's right off the main drag in downtown Cimarron and next door to the post office, but it’s very quiet. It’s an old inn built in the 1800s. You can pull right up front to park, which is nice.
You enter the inn through a traditional lobby and the suite is easily accessed on the ground floor. It was a warm day and cool night but the temperature in the room was very comfortable.
The apartment is very spacious and the sofa and bed were comfortable. The space is clean and there were plenty of towels in the bathroom.
We were traveling cross country with two small dogs. We found a great fenced dog park in Dodge City, where we stopped on the way to Cimarron. We brought salads with us from Trader Joe’s in Omaha so I can’t comment on local restaurants.
Great communication from Kathleen.
A nice, hassle-free stay. Thank you."

In the midst of a hectic tornado of a trip, her timely communications allowed me to relax, knowing that our lodging was handled. She was warm and welcoming, and made us feel completely at home, down to providing personalized cupcakes and banners in honor of my husband's birthday. The space was also very warm, homey and inviting. To quote my husband, ""This is the most ""in my living room"" that I have felt while being away from home."" We enjoyed the feel and decor of the historic hotel and appreciated the readings and photos provided that helped us learn about the building's storied past. We highly recommend the Parlor Suite."

Stayed a few nights","This home greatly exceeded our expectations based on the Airbnb photos and modest description. It has been beautifully updated and decorated inside and out, and was impeccably clean. I have rented a fair number of vacation homes nationally and internationally and don't give this kind of review often. The home has 3 nicely sized bedrooms with very comfortable beds - two queens and one king - plus 2 full gorgeous bathrooms. With the first floor living and dining rooms and the finished basement area, there was plenty of space to spread out and enjoy, and was the perfect size for my husband and me plus my two sisters. We will definitely request to rent this home for our next visit to Garden City and would recommend it to anyone else looking for a comfortable, beautifully-appointed house close to the downtown area."

We walked to main street in minutes, felt safe and the backyard was much more than we expected.

Stayed with kids",Nothing short of a beautiful and welcoming home. The yard was nice to let my kids run around in and the house was so spacious. D’Arcy and the cleaning lady were both exceptionally friendly. My only complaint would be that it’s a little difficult to get heavy luggage into the home after it rains due to a lack of drain systems on the street where parking is available and check out seems a bit earlier than most hosts offer especially considering it’s in between two times zones. It won’t deter me from a 5 star rating though. It was peaceful and all the lighting on and in the house made me feel safe arriving late at night.

It was a blistering, hot day, and when we got back to the house after a busy day, it was heaven- cool, comfortable, and just right! The perfect place to relax!
Everything was meticulous.
Our hosts were excellent.
I could stay for a year!
You can bet this is my first choice when I'm back in the area.

Stayed one night",This was such a good find. Exactly what we needed. Everything is so well furnished and thought out. The beds are excellent. And the best relaxing living room furniture of so many others that we've stayed in. Perfect for watching the Tigers win game 1 of D1 baseball championship.

Stayed one night","We needed two hotel rooms for our stay in Garden City. D’Arcy’s place provided a lovely 2 bedroom/2bath and entire house for a better price than what we would’ve paid for hotel rooms. The house is cute and comfortable and immaculately clean. A lot of thought has been put into making sure that everything a guest might need is provided. The linens were luxurious, the decor was beautiful and the beds were very comfortable. We enjoyed a nice stroll around the neighborhood in the evening and coffee on the back porch in the morning. I highly recommend this place! Will definitely stay again when we travel through Garden City."

It was a safe spot (and yes even a key for the front door). Caleb and his wife were some of the kindest Airbnb hosts we’ve ever had…and we’ve stayed in a lot of airbnbs. Whether you’re staying for work, traveling through, or just want to retreat from the city life and disconnect, we highly recommend this place!"

The shower worked well too, had abundant hot water. The bedroom had dark curtains and the neighborhood was quiet and safe.
It's a nice one-night place to stay. Didn't really watch TV or stayed very long, since we were trying to get back on the road early the next day.
The only item I would upgrade would be the cooking utensils, pots and pans. Also make sure you leave enough time to do all the dishes before you leave."

Stayed one night","Quiet neighborhood and a private loft. Hot shower and a comfortable bed after a long day of travel. Jerry was responsive and instructions were easy to follow. Bring laundry supplies for in-unit washer/dryer, otherwise all other amenities are provided: coffee & creamer, body wash & towels, streaming smart tv, dishes, etc. I especially enjoyed the black-out curtains on the bedroom windows as it allowed me to sleep in a bit. Will stay again!"

The place was private, quiet, and peaceful. We both work from home and found the internet was great. The place was clean, plenty of room to spread out and work in two different rooms. Jerry was quick to respond and answer questions. We ate at Cattlemen’s on Jerry’s recommendation and it was amazing. Had the chicken fried chicken and cat fish. Sweet workers. Not a big town, but the people were the sweetest. If we ever come this way again, we will stay here for sure."

Being upstairs afforded us the use of a private deck overlooking the neighborhood, which proved very peaceful, watching squirrels and birds. Jerry made sure that there was coffee and creamer available for morning. Also although we did not use it, there is a washer and dryer downstairs. All in all a wonderful place."

Stayed with kids","My family needed a place to spend the night on our drive through Kansas. We were given helpful instructions on how to find the place as the address in g-maps is insufficient. I was able to tag the spot on the map ahead of time and find it without any difficulty once we drove there.
I love the blackout curtains that allow for my kids to sleep but also move easily and allow you to see the beautiful sunrise over the fields. We also thought it was fun to park on the scale and see how much all our cargo weighed!
They provided a pack n play with a sheet when requested and we all slept like rocks in the beautiful silence. Beautiful and friendly dogs. My 3 year old is usually terrified of dogs but enjoyed petting their dogs.
Good spot to spend the night. Thanks!"

There was no rocker. Ryan was very responsive and easy to deal with. Thank you Ryan! The outside light was burned out which was a negative as we arrived late and could see nothing. It was quiet and private. Over all it’s worth the money if you don’t mind making do with whatever doesn’t work or is missing.

Stayed with a pet","Our Airbnb was amazing for me in a way that had nothing to do with the actual accommodations, but the landscape. Being from eastern Kansas I always get a little miffed/defensive when people dismissively talk about Kansas being flat. I’m so quick to assure them it’s not all flat, like that’s a bad thing. This place was FLAT and gorgeous! There had been a lot of rain and a storm the night we were there, so as we left it was a 360 degree green earth against a perfectly even blue sky. Of course puffy clouds everywhere. Over the rainbow country! Flat and fabulous!
Accommodations were nicely country! If you’re not into a country stay, don’t stay here. It will be wasted on you. There is a mile of dirt road so be aware of weather. There was a lot of rain around time we went so quite muddy. Don’t go for the wifi, it’s spotty. Take a break and disconnect. I’m sending my family who travel between Albuquerque and eastern Kansas to stay here."

Cute little guesthouse has all the necessities and farmhouse-chic decor. The kids were thrilled to find coloring books and crayons in their room. The main bedroom's bed is huge and luxuriously soft - best sleep of the whole cross country road trip - and it was great that the kids could have separate beds in their room. In the morning we met chickens, ducks, horses (one very big, one very small), and one barn cat before heading out. As someone who grew up in the country but has lived in cities the last decade plus, the highlight was definitely that night sky! Absolutely breathtaking!!"

It was a clawfoot tub on a platform so I could see it being challenging for some to step in. The temperature was also impossible to control. It was nice waking up and saying hello to all the animals. The dogs weren't super friendly to my dog but they were very people friendly. Overall, it was a great place to stay and I would recommend."

We had some difficulty finding the location because we arrived later in the night but the host was kind enough to rescue us when we were aimlessly driving around 😂 There were the most adorable dogs on the premises we had the pleasure of giving many belly rubs to and the Airbnb space was adorable, comfy, and well equipped! We were in and out pretty quick due to our travel itinerary but I’m confident that this is a lovely, relaxing place to stay for a small vacation. I would also like to mention that the host was very kind and one of the most responsive Airbnb hosts I’ve had."

They called her in when I requested and that was appreciated. A nice place to stay and get away, especially for road trips!"

Group trip","A relaxing, quiet, and comfortable stay! The listing description perfectly lays out what to expect and it is important to follow the host’s directions in because Waze and Google maps will take you along dirt roads for a whole lot longer than you’ll want. Master bed was oh so comfortable. I slept so peacefully! Pet friendly with approval and an additional fee. My kids enjoyed watching the chickens and ducks, petting the friendly resident turkey, and playing fetch with farm dogs. We were in town to visit family, but were able to make our stay into a relaxing mini-vacation. House is clean and cozy with plenty of linens and appointments to keep my family of 5 comfortable for three nights. Ryan is very prompt with communications and extremely helpful as any issues arise. If we are ever back in the area, this is where we will be staying."

The bathroom floor/shower mat was covered in small bugs that crawl all over your feet and there were a few pretty big wolf spiders that were definitely not afraid of humans."

Stayed with kids","This place was excellent value - it comfortably slept our family of four without feeling like we were on top of each other, and the separate rooms were a welcome change from the four of us all in a shared space for the preceding 6 nights we'd spent on our road trip / vacation. The king-sized bed was exceptionally comfortable and I my only regret was that I had to get out of it in the morning. The kids enjoyed the bunk beds, too. We didn't prepare any extravagant meals while there, but it appeared to have everything one would need for making breakfast, lunch & dinner. The linens provided for bed & bath were also more than adequate for us, and it was nice not having to unpack that which we'd brought with us just for a night.
Overall, definitely recommend a stay here if you happen to be in the area. We were on a trip back home from a couple states west of KS but wanted a change of pace from the same trip out we'd made along I-70. It's 15 minutes (or less) from US-56, 83 & 160, so close enough to any highways you might be traveling, but far enough out that you don't have nosy neighbors. Just a word of warning if you book this place - heed the owner's advice about directions when he sends them to you, since Google seems to have made a mess of how the streets in the area are labeled."

The location is typical of Great Plains lands, with fresh air and sweeping ground level views. The animals are a nice touch. The “amenities” are the authenticity. Animals, farmland, a good and safe place to stay. Rustic and small but country living is real. We were a family of four, with school age kids and a dog. Comfortable, plenty of food in Sublette (15-20 minutes). What a beautiful piece of the earth."

We really enjoyed driving out into the rural Kansas farmland and arriving at his beautiful farm! We were greeted by his sweet friendly dogs and easily found access to the lovely apartment that is separate from the main house. The place was charming and full of lots of nice country style touches -- including farm fresh eggs in the frig! The kitchen was all set up to cook with dishes utensils and cookware -- we enjoyed making our home cooked meal upon arrival! It was a very quiet cozy and restful stay -- We would definitely like to return sometime!

Stayed one night",Ryan was very kind to host us at the last minute -- even including the change in our night's stay. He was very accommodating! The space was clean and full of amenities --full kitchen and even farm fresh eggs in the frig! Check in and check out was quite easy. It was quite a comfortable stay out in the middle of quintessential Kansas farmland! The animals were sweet too!

There was a smell in one of the bedrooms (it's on a farm, so that's not unexpected), but other than that, it was a good space with everything I needed. You have to drive up a dirt road, so if it's rained recently, be prepared for your car to get muddy!"

She loved meeting all of the farm animals she had never seen before. The bed in the guest house was very comfortable and I slept great. I loved that it was cold as well- after 9 hours of driving in the heat and sun it was very satisfying. Ryan was also very quick to respond when I got lost right before dark during a brief rain storm."

D'Arcy has done a great job at anticipating what her guests might be needing. I think this is the best condition of any AirBnB we've been in.
The arrangement of the rooms worked well for us with a shower on every floor making it easy for us all to be getting ready at the same time. The best surprise was the soft water; Garden City's is not the best. When I'm back in this area again overnight this is where I want to be staying."

Impossible to beat the price for the accommodations. My room was huge, had my own bathroom, and sitting room. Kriztine is one of the nicest people I have met and the way she describes her place is exactly what you get. You can be as secluded or social as you want to be. Her loving dogs are a bonus to your stay."

Great coffee selection, and the back patio was my favorite place to sit with a fire and listen to the birds. I even used the gas grill one evening after work. Overall, hopefully I don't have to work at that particular worksite ever again, but if I do, I will definitely stay here again."

Kriztine was such a great host, she even took me with her when she went out to get groceries which I was able to cook during my stay. She really knows how to accomodate people who travels for work. This place is definitely worth staying. I highly recommend it for people needing an immediate and quick stay in garden city."

It wasn’t just clean, the property is beautiful, the patio is relaxing, the kitchen is top notch, and my room with all of its space and natural sunlight was very peaceful. It’s tucked away in a quiet neighborhood away from the busy areas of Garden City but still just minutes from everything you need. I was worried that staying in someone elses home would be an awkward experience but she’s just a natural host and made me feel right at home. Jackpot!"

Stayed a few nights","This place for our 3 night stay was exactly as described in the listing. What stood out was the friendliness, responsiveness, and helpfulness of the hosts. Not a full kitchen, but the food preparation area was clean, well-suited for coffee preparation and heating food in the microwave. A big plus was plentiful small snacks like candy and protein bars, even a couple of drinks in the mini-fridge. The dog is very friendly, brought over one of his numerous balls to play with. As older people, we found getting seated on the raised toilet challenging, but we managed. The shared living room is a very comfortable place to sit to read or watch TV. The hosts stay on the first floor other than doing laundry. The only time I ran into the hosts was meeting Mike who was working in the backyard when we arrived. Shanna texted me the morning after our first night and I got her ok to rearrange the bedroom some to make ourselves more comfortable. I would not hesitate staying again."
