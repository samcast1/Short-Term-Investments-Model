Stayed a few nights","Perfection. We could not have been happier with this beautiful condo. We were taking our first child to college nearby and this was the perfect retreat for some final moments together. The setting is absolutely beautiful and the home provided the perfect space for our family. The kids liked it even more than our own house!! Cecilia was beyond helpful and responsive, the home was absolutely spotless, and everything was exactly as pictured, if not better. We will be back as often as we can!"

Stayed with kids","We traveled from Mississippi and chose this as a gathering place to visit with nearby family. It worked well as we were able to cook when we wanted to and it was comfortable for sleeping when family was able to stay the night. Nearby lake is a bonus via hiking trail. Beautiful, well equipped kitchen and screened in porch that looks out into peaceful woods. Washer/dryer was a bonus. Quiet duplex community. TV in living room. 2 very nice, fully equipped bathrooms(shampoo, conditioner, body wash) Bring your hair dryer if you need one. Ceiling fans in every room. 2 car garage. Communication with Cecelia was easy. We would stay again."

Stayed a few nights","We LOVED this home! New home, spacious, well appointed. It was beautiful inside and out, near town but hidden away in a quiet development. Screened in back deck was amazing. We were attending a COM conference from North Carolina at the fairgrounds, yet saw deer, squirrels, raccoons, and a ton of birds. Tea, coffee, and water awaited our arrival. We stayed a week, even walked to town one day. We have had several Airbnb stays, and few 5’s but this is one. Confidently recommend."

The historic (1900 or so?) home is in excellent condition, recently renovated in many details. It was perfect for our family gathering including married children and grandchildren.

Group trip","We selfishly want to keep this gem in Jonesville a secret! Phoebe went above and beyond to accommodate us while visiting for a family funeral. The house is pristine and loved the old house feel. The house is beautifully decorated and the beds are very comfortable. Phoebe has thought about and provided everything you might need. The only minor issue is the first bathroom is right off the kitchen and not close to upstairs bath. But the 2nd bath is upstairs by the 4 bedrooms. The kitchen is beautiful and has everything you might need, including coffee pods, spices, oil and vinegar, etc. The house is only a little over a block from downtown Jonesville and close to the bakery, restaurants and park. We thoroughly enjoyed our 4 nights and look forward to coming back!"

Stayed about a week","This is a beautiful and comfortable place to stay in the small, historic town of Jonesville. Lots of thoughtful amenities provided by our hosts! Well stocked, comfy beds, spacious and elegant, with all the modern conveniences. We enjoyed walking the safe, quiet neighborhood with interesting old homes and buildings. Very short commute to Hillsdale College and a lovely, easy drive to Ann Arbor. (Fellow coffee snobs, Rough Draft by HC campus has you covered, less than 10 min away, we stopped there repeatedly.) We were very impressed to wake up after a good snow fall to find an excellent young man clearing the driveway and sidewalks first thing in the morning! Perfect house, neighborhood, and hosts; highly recommend, and we felt it was a great value."

Stayed a few nights","It was nothing short of a privilege to stay at the Wetmore house. Located walking distance from downtown,
this place was such a delight. The care and time that was put to restore this historic home is so evident. From the exquisitely chosen furniture to the hand painted art on the wall, this home was restored with such love. Every need you could possibly have is already anticipated — kitchen stocked with coffee, teas, and creamers; a welcome wine and snack basket; the washer complete with stain removers and sprays; bathrooms with extra toiletries; baby crib and accessories; and a large box of box of board games. The home easily and comfortably fits 8, complete with the most comfortable beds. The neighborhood is quaint and quiet and the backyard offers a great setup for evenings on the patio, should you visit in the summer. Phoebe was prompt to respond to every request and went above and beyond to make our stay absolutely wonderful. I could not recommend the Wetmore house more."

Equipped with a large dining-room table; quality appliances; plenty of kitchen counter space, cabinet shelving, cooking gear & utensils. The four large upstairs bedrooms each have a luggage rack, hangers, dresser drawers, extra linens, and a mirror. Mattresses and pillows are very comfortable. Tub shower upstairs; stall shower downstairs. Good water pressure. Ten minute drive to Hillsdale College campus. Parking is secure. Owner is friendly and responsive. She solved a problem we had very quickly. Overall, a wonderful stay and would come again!"

Group trip","Firefly was a great location for a long weekend family getaway. Everything you could possibly think of was provided by the host for our use. The kids enjoyed the kayaks and paddle boards, spending several hours exploring the area. We had fires at night to cook smores and then relaxed in the enclosed porch. The surrounding homes were close, but it was quiet and the one neighbor we met was very friendly. I have no complaints and would stay there again. This is probably one of my top stays due to all of the amenities provided."

Stayed with kids","Our stay at Firefly Cottage was fantastic. The cottage is comfy and cozy. Every comfort of home, superb attention to detail. Clean and spacious. Fluffy towels, soft blankets, a kitchen filled with everything you need. Great selection of games, ping pong (adults loved this just as much as the kids!)
The lakefront is beautiful. So much fun with the kayaks exploring the lake, floating on inflatables, watching the swans and cranes. S’mores by the fire, watching the sunsets. The community was very friendly; great for walks and scooter/bike rides. (To the little store for popsicles)
Scott was an excellent host. Checked in with us to make sure all was well. Very responsive.
I could go on and on….just book it! You’ll be so glad you did."

Not only was the property exactly as the photos and descriptions listed, but the hosts had thought of every detail necessary, down to plastic baggies or spare hangers. It’s conveniently located between downtown Hillsdale and Hillsdale College, and on a quiet street. Plenty of parking! Most importantly, the hosts, Elizabeth and Russell, go well above and beyond to offer flexibility and hospitality to their guests. We visited town to be with a family member who was passing, and they went out of their way to make sure our every need was well taken care of. Could not recommend more highly!"

The location is very convenient to campus and Johnny T’s, a restaurant we like in Hillsdale. The linens and towels are all white, which I appreciate. One mattress is a little firmer and one a little softer so there is something for everyone. Definitely recommended!"

She responded to any messages or questions instantly. They thought of a lot of things that made our stay more enjoyable; like good coffee, and half and half in the fridge for cream, a big bottle of water, and even a stick of butter in the fridge, which came in handy, because we made breakfast each morning at the airbnb, and we like toast with butter. I would definitely stay there again."

I’m sure she doesn’t hear what he says to us! Only what he wants to tell her! We’re DONE!

Woke up to shoveled walks after an overnight snowstorm, enjoyed easy cable and Wi-Fi accessibility and details like laundry sheets in each drawer to provide freshness! We highly recommend this cozy getaway and will make it our destination again when visiting family in the area!"

Stayed with a pet","The home is great - very cute, nicely decorated, well-appointed amenities, etc.. The lake is just a short jaunt away and the neighborhood seemed friendly. We enjoyed a night at the fire ring with local friends and meeting the owners.
We really only had 1 issue specific to me only and it doesn't affect my rating of the home as it's so specific.
The specific issue I personally had is that the home is not furnished well for tall folks. I am 6'3"" which will be far above most folks' need to accommodate so this isn't at all a knock on the owners or the home, just a heads up for any other tall people that might be looking. The couches have short cushions and they are very narrow so I wasn't able to get comfortable there for movie, and the beds are relatively short as well. I ONLY put this in my review as to hopefully help anyone else long in the leg. It's a great spot!"

Stayed with a pet","This summer my kids requested a “do nothing” vacation which really meant they wanted to have unscheduled days to swim and play. The Bear’s Den was exactly that!
The cottage is clean and tidy. Everything we needed was available to us. We cooked/ate in most days, were easily able to do laundry as needed and were comfortable as a family of 5 at all times.
The location of the cottage is quiet and peaceful. The neighbors that were “home” while we visited were friendly and helpful. I felt comfortable allowing my kids (13, 11 and 8) to come and go as they pleased from the cottage down to the dock. They enjoyed swimming and floating at the dock, taking the kayaks around to explore and trying their hand at fishing for the first time.
Jamie and Akrum were on property the weekend we arrived and we’re so helpful in making coffee shop and restaurant recommendations, helped get us situated with the kayaks and gave us a thorough run down on the lake, how to get to Pike Lake, etc."

Stayed with kids","We stayed here with our 3yr-old and 1yr-old for a week in the heat of summer, and it was delightful. The air conditioning worked extremely well (which we deeply appreciated), the kitchen was well-equipped (the electric griddle was fantastic--the kids LOVED having pancakes in the morning), there was plenty of pantry and fridge space for our groceries, and Jamie & Akrum even went out of their way to provide us with a high chair and a crib (let alone a few delicious ice cream sandwiches as an extra treat)! We didn't go out boating or anything, but the kids really enjoyed dipping their toes in the lake.
Worth noting: the house was so well sound-proofed that 4th-of-July fireworks and loud music blasting from next door late into the night didn't disturb the kids' (or our own) sleep in the slightest.
Jamie & Arkum were friendly, generous, kind, and responsive throughout our stay, and the price was an absolute steal for the space, let alone the lake at sunset and the fireflies. Just magic."

I knew it would be an especially difficult weekend, so I found a place that seemed like it would be peaceful and comfortable. This home, and Susan as a host, far exceeded what we hoped for."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I rented Susan’s lovely home to stay locally for our daughter’s wedding. Upon arrival, the home was even more beautiful and meticulous in person. Susan has a keen eye for detail and every guest amenity has been considered.
Susan had separate coffee and tea stations (and fresh cream) for those of us needing a caffeine boost in the morning. The kitchen has every appliance, serving dish and kitchen tool needed to prepare gourmet meals. I was even able to host Sunday brunch with all the beautiful entertainer touches. Bedrooms and bathrooms are appointed with luxurious linens and stylish furnishings. We slept like babies in the midst of our hectic schedule.
After the wedding festivities wound down, my husband and I enjoyed a relaxing afternoon on the comfortable front porch recapping the weekend with a cocktail, watching the deer bed down in the nearby trees as the warm summer rain began.
We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect home or Host for the wedding weekend!"

The big windows and sliding glass door let in nice light in the living room. This unit is in a quiet cul-de-sac, so very little traffic.

Two of the bedrooms also have a luggage rack and two even have chests of drawers. And one has a desk and chair, where my husband was able to work remotely. My adult daughter appreciated the secluded nook at the front end of the living room, which she used as a makeshift home-office with a window view. The kitchen also has lots of cupboard space for storing food and cooking equipment. Jackie is very friendly and responsive. We look forward to staying again."

The stairs are very steep so if you have any accessibility concerns, all bedrooms are on the top floor and you have to climb stairs to get to the apartment. May not be suitable for individuals that cannot handle a lot of stairs.

Little extension cords made it so easy to plug things in anywhere. I’m always cold, so all the extra blankets (wonderful, soft and cuddly ones) were perfect. There was no shortage of towels (thank you!!) or toilet paper. We were within walking distance of everything we needed and all the locations for events around our son’s wedding. Jackie quickly responded to all my questions and requests (including sharing the Amazon link for an appliance she loaned me that I loved). The entire process was easy and I felt at home. The three bedrooms are spaced out enough for solid privacy. It was a lovely experience all the way around. I was a little sad leaving the ‘dale this morning. Thank you!"

Group trip","Great location. Most places we wanted to get to were less than a 10 minute drive. We had 6 people and lots of activities to prepare for, so the quiet time nook was a great place to escape to if you needed to be alone to study or contemplate. Plenty of light with high ceilings - takes away the cramped feeling you might have at other places. There are three stories of stairs to contend with, but that was evident from the description. Figured we would get some needed unintentional exercise. Saved money by eating in after shopping at the nearby supermarket, but the are several restaurants available within walking distance if you prefer otherwise. Tastefully decorated."

Stayed a few nights","Jackie's place is beautiful and so much bigger than we expected! The beds are comfy, and it's so nice to have three separate bedrooms. The back bedroom is separated from the rest and feels especially private. It was also handy to have a powder room (toilet & sink) downstairs in addition to the full bathroom (shower, no tub) upstairs. There are many hooks for hanging things in the bedrooms and bathrooms plus full-rod closets in each bedroom. Towels are also plentiful. Everything was clean. And the apartment was quiet, in spite of being atop a business on a main street in the center of town. It's also just a few minutes' drive from the College and from the local chain grocery store (Kroger).
Some guests might like to know that the street parking, while close and convenient to the door, is all parallel, not angled head-in, but also that on the back (non-entrance) side of the building there is a big, well-lit parking lot with plenty of available spaces and it can be seen from the kitchen and back-bedroom windows. Others may appreciate a heads-up that the stairwell that goes to the third floor, where all of the bedrooms are, can be a little difficult to maneuver since the steps are of uneven depths. We managed fine; just had to remember to take them slow.
All in all, we were pleased with our stay at Jackie's and we will certainly consider coming again. Recommended!"

I would look for something with more privacy next time. Probably won't stay again, but they were a pretty good host. I hope they fix the leaky sink, started leaking on the floor the day we left."

The decor was adorable and the small chocolates that were left was the first thing our eyes honed onto after a 12 hour drive from Connecticut to Michigan. The informational pamphlet/book about the surrounding local activities and favorite restaurants was a great idea and helped us so we didn’t get lost in the area. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and will be telling friends as well as coming back when we are back in the area again!"

It is a lakeside property although you cannot view the lake from the apartment, the windows are large & bright with curtains for privacy. The place is tiny with an adorable retro kitchen, private bedroom and well appointed bedding and sitting area. Ronda & Steve were perfect hosts in every way. In the morning, I received a text from Ronda to let me know there were a number of swans on the lake in front of their house and if I wanted to take a look I could. We appreciated the pound of starbucks coffee left by the coffee maker! Would definitely stay here again!"

On top of that there is an abundance of counter space, dishes & pans, cooking utensils, and paper products (paper towels, napkins, tissues, & toilet paper)! It has also been helpful every time to have the separate/private work space on the weatherized back porch. Great place!"

It's obvious that she is proactive and detail-oriented regarding guests' needs and comfort. She even provides free-and-clear (hypoallergenic) laundry supplies, which is a blessing to folks like us who are sensitive to chemical additives! Mindi was also immediately responsive and dedicated to quickly resolving a problem that came up during our stay. Highly recommend Mindi's place--just please don't beat us to booking it! ;-)"

Walking distance to all of downtown Hillsdale.
Be sure to check out Hillsdale Brewing Company a block away. They have a HUGE (indoor) beer garden in the back with toys and games for kids.
For breakfast, try Rough Draft, right next to Hillsdale Brewing. They do beautiful drinks, and have a GREAT charcuterie board that's surprisingly cheap.
There's a creek at the end of the yard, which our kids enjoyed putting sticks in, and they even saw their first live crayfish!
Really enjoyed our stay. Provided guidebook made everything clear, and Mindi even sent a YouTube video for starting the dishwasher before we needed to use it. Very proactive!

Stayed a few nights",Minding has been the best host we have had so far with Airbnb. Her communication is above and beyond as is her rental. We drove all night for a family emergency to find our accommodations elsewhere didn't exist. After being awake 32hrs and needing somewhere to stay Mindi was able to accommodate us with an early check in and was very understanding to our situation. The house was stocked with anything we could have needed if not shopping was close by. Mindi checked in on us when the weather turned bad and the tornado sirens went off in town to make sure we would know where to go. It was comforting that we weren't alone. We will 100% stay here again the next time we are in town. There are train tracks that run next to the house but do not worry about those the trains don't use those that we had seen and from what some locals had told us. Perfect host and house!!!

Stayed about a week","The first thing I noticed upon opening the door to Mindi's place is that it still has that lovely smell of new wood. The house definitely is all new inside, very crisp and clean feeling, very modern. It is obvious that Mindi put much care into the design, layout, and furnishings during the remodel--terrific attention to detail. The mattresses are super comfy, the rooms are abundantly lit, the appliances are top-notch, and the kitchen is well equipped. Mindi's place also offers much privacy with frosted window panes in many key spots, a wooden panel fence on the only side that has a neighbor, and a secluded back yard. We enjoyed eating dinner outside on the patio and even saw deer come up from the creek at the back of the property. Pulling into or out of the driveway can be a little bit tricky, but it's not at all a busy street, and so many things in town (including the college campus) are delightfully walkable from this location anyway. It's situated right along railroad tracks, which we were concerned might pose a safety or noise issue, but by the end, we had to admit we were disappointed that not a single train went by during our 8-day stay. I highly recommend Mindi's place!"

For us being an hour and some change away from home we felt like we didn’t leave at all! The farmers market was another awesome treat that sweetened the weekend for us on our stay! Emilie and her daughter have a booth there with all kinds of vegetables and different breads and tasty jams to go with. I would recommend this for anyone who wants to unplug from reality and step into the country for a weekend. Being able to see and help with her daily life was a true treat! I would definitely stay again and again.

Truly a place of respite (particularly for this desert city dweller!!)"

Even spied the B&Bs namesake Bluebird. Friendly kitties and dogs come to say hello. Gray and white cat hung out with us in the morning snoozing in the chair next to us.

Emilie is a perfect hostess. We enjoyed hearing about the sheep and the farm. Breakfast was always delicious - omelettes, quiche, sourdough bread, blueberry muffins. Everything homemade with fresh ingredients.
Hillsdale is a small college town about 15 minutes away and the farm is quiet, which was perfect. Hillsdale isn't a ""tourist"" area but still had plenty of things to do. We enjoyed walking around the Children's Garden and the Aboretum at Hillsdale College. We also drove down to Baw Beese Lake. There is fishing, boating, swimming, and great views. If you are there on a weekend during the summer, you can check out the Farmer's Market in town.
We highly recommend a stay at Bluebird Trails."

Emilie (the host) is the best host I've had experience with on Airbnb. She brought us breakfast every morning, let us explore her beautiful farm, and let us play with her beautiful animals. And speaking of the animals... Oh. My. God. They are incredibly friendly and beautiful. We would be greeted in the morning by them coming up the porch! If you love animals, you're at the right place!"

Beds were very comfortable, the apartment was spotlessly clean and she provides nice snack items and a well stocked kitchen with basics. The fresh breakfasts she supplies are amazing!!
She also has a nice selection of movies, games and even a few toys for kids.
The farm is gorgeous, very peaceful, quiet and there's lots of space for walking.
The location was very convenient for going into town for Hillsdale College events (~15 min drive).
Emilie's space provided our family with a lovely retreat while attending college commencement.
I also recommend checking out the fresh farm goods that Emilie sells as well! Delicious raw honey, eggs, bread and other items."

Stayed a few nights","This was my best Air BnB stay to date! These days AirB has turned into such a business in the US that it’s often the same experience as staying in a hotel. Not so with Emilie! This is the way it used to be before we capitulated to the idea that humans are just here to extract money from - kind, generous human interaction and sharing :).
The unit itself is quite nice, large for two people, clean and well organized. The kitchen is large and stocked not just with cooking ware, but with granola, milk, orange juice, spices and other food.
The out doors are lovely and nature. Many deer, beavers, a Bald Eagle, owl, sheep, dogs, squirrels and much more.
But the real peak is Emilie’s generosity. Homecooked full breakfasts every morning! Awesome sourdough bread and muffins. Any other spices or pots we asked for. Flexibility and kindness :).
Thank you very much my friend."

On this short visit she made us the best homemade blueberry muffins I have ever had, and a veggie quiche (with fresh eggs from her farm!) that was to die for.
Our young daughter loves watching all the animals out the window each day and visiting with them outside. We live in a big city in Texas, so farm life is a special treat for her.

Emilie provides yogurt, butter, milk, and orange juice in the fridge, and olive oil and other pantry items are in the cupboard above the stove. Her breakfasts, delivered contactlessly at the time of your choosing to the table on the deck outside the sliding door to the apartment, are so delicious. She uses eggs from the chickens in the yard. The quiche, crepes, and muffins were terrific. Emilie always responds to messages really quickly.
Tip: download or screenshot your navigation directions before you leave Emilie's (or when you are on your way there) because your map app may not work within several miles of the house."

Stayed a few nights","So happy with our stay. The unit was sparkling clean with so many quiet, but important details. Coffee, night lights in all the right places, extra bedding where we needed it. Everything was intuitive and easy. We were there for parent’s weekend at the local college, so we weren’t able to spend much time exploring the property, but it was beautiful. The sheep, cute dogs, chickens, ponds, fall foliage. Just lovely.
Emilie communicated with us on everything. Her quiche on Sunday morning was amazing... so amazing that my college guy kept the leftovers to share with his dorm bros:)
The only thing to be aware of is that the bathroom is very tiny. Clean and new, but tiny. A bit awkward to share if you aren’t staying with people only within your family unit. Not a flaw, just something to keep in mind if, say, two couples were sharing the space.
No hesitation at all in recommending this property. Quiet, easy sleeping, comfortable beds, lovely extras. Thanks so much!"

My son and I enjoyed going along in the morning to meet the sheep and chickens and learn a little about raising them. It was so cool watching the dogs work with the sheep, so well trained, happiest dogs we've ever seen! Wonderful experience , especially for children. Note that if you have t mobile phone service you may not get good reception but not a big deal. If you need internet wifi works well. The bed was Soo comfortable! The breakfast Emilie made each day was absolutely delicious. She went above and beyond to make our experience great. If you're looking for a peaceful get away this is the place. Emilie is overall a thoughtful and hard working host!"

Both mornings one of us went with one or more of our kids to feed the chickens and walk with the sheep to the pasture, it was so great to see the sheepdogs at work. The apartment itself is clean and inviting with modern, friendly decor. The ample windows are screened to let in the sounds of the bull frogs and views of the treetops. If that is not your cup of tea, then the mitsibushi ac works great! I do advise bringing DVDsas the host suggests. Thank you for a great trip, we will be back!"

Stayed a few nights","We've been talking about our wonderful stay at Emilie's place the entire drive home - and it's a long one!
We arrived very late but Emilie's directions were perfect and she had the light on for us. The apartment is so charming and she's maximized the space to provide everything you need. Due to the virus outbreak, she currently can't come up and cook breakfast but she left a full range of ingredients in the fridge for us, AND she hand-delivered a delicious breakfast quiche to us two different mornings!
We especially loved taking long walks on the property to see the ponds, observe the sheep and chickens, and just relax and spend time together. My wife had never been on a farm, so it was pretty special to show her a glimpse of how I grew up.
The highlight of the stay was walking out to the field with Emilie one evening to bring the sheep back to the yard. She answered our many questions and we loved playing with the dogs along the way and seeing them work on the return trip. The mornings were quite dewey, so if you'd rather go out with her then I'd recommend some rain boots. We actually bought some and didn't end up needing them so they're in the hall closet if you forget yours!
Emilie's description of the place is very accurate - WiFi is strong inside the apartment for everyday use, but we did have some problems with streaming. Not a problem for us - we opted instead to sit out on the deck and read. I would recommend bringing some bug spray with you though.
Overall this quiet retreat was exactly what we needed in the midst of this new crazy world. We will definitely be back - and will bring our fishing poles along next time! We highly recommend this place!"

Nestled in trees, surrounded by pastures and small lily pad ponds, the sounds of nature are calming. We were welcomed by a couple friendly dogs and a bottle lamb who loves attention! Our upstairs lodging was very clean and efficient. We had everything we needed at hand to make dinner (couldn’t go out to eat during the COVID), and a delightful breakfast spread. We woke up hearing the farm wake up, lambs, birds and roosters. Loved it."

Stayed a few nights","It was a perfect haven to get away from the weekend. Even before entering the upstairs I could hear the birds singing, squirrels chattering and the sheep calling to each other. The view from the upper deck was picturesque. A large pond with pine and birch trees across the bank looked as though it was a living painting.
There were so many vibrant red Cardinals and Bluejays that gathered in the trees near the home.
After walking in the bedrooms looked so warm and cozy. The room I chose had a little wooden grandfather clock that was quietly ticking.
Much to my surprise and delight there was a welcome not and homemade chocolate chip cookies!
Everything was so clean and inviting.
It was the best getaway I have had in years. The perfect retreat to recharge and explore nature. The trails are so serene to walk and the views are stunning.
Emilie was the best hostess, she went above and beyond to ensure my stay was memorable and her blueberry muffins are out of this world!
She happily welcomed me to join her to observe her and her well trained dogs work with the sheep.
She made me feel so at home that I will definitely be back!"

Stayed with kids","Emilie is nice and an amazing cook! She made us pancakes and quiche (the bacon and onion is killer). She is so friendly and we loved meeting her. The apartment is very comfy and the property beautiful. Two things to be aware of: 1. The internet is satellite so can’t handle much beyond email or social media. I did not know this and had some work to do. I’m a designer and work in large files. What would normally take me 2-3 hours took me all day because nothing would load. I eventually had to have someone back home upload the files for me. Great if you wanna escape, REALLY frustrating if you need to work. 2. The bedrooms are not on the same heating source as the living space. With the bedrooms doors closed, the rooms were very cold. My toddler woke up super early due to this. So we kept his door open to warm it up for him while he slept."

I let her know in advance that I was REALLY looking forward sitting under the stars in the middle of the country & having a bonfire and she made sure the firepit was set up for us with plenty of woods & twigs; she also stocked a box with papers & matches for us to use to start it.
We absolutely LOVED watching the dogs herd the sheep - it was an amazing thing to see for the first time! The dogs were friendly & liked getting lots of pats while they weren't working.
We also enjoyed taking many hikes around her property."

It is unbelievably clean and comfortable, with thoughtful touches and zero clutter. The space is bright and airy with lots of screened windows (which we left open all night to enjoy the sounds of nature and fresh air).
Emilie treated us to a great time with the sheep and dogs. The views of the countryside while out on the land are breathtakingly beautiful.
Emilie is great—warm, responsive, and kind. She obviously loves what she does.
Our only regret is that we weren’t able to stay longer; we will be back as soon as our travels bring us back to Michigan!"

Stayed with kids","This stay is a gem! We were looking for a quiet retreat for our family and happened upon Emilie's listing. Her space is a private upstairs apartment attached to her home. It was very clean and well stocked with thoughtful touches. She was available via the app for questions offering us local suggestions and instruction as needed. The lamb farm itself is a magical place with a big old climbing tree right outside the window. At night you are greeted by a beautiful lightshow as thousands of lightening bugs sparkle in the trees. In the morning, Emilie brought up fresh baked blueberry muffins and a quiche. After breakfast, we were treated to a wagon ride to her flock of sheep in the pasture. We were able to interact with the animals (including some darling dogs) and feed the lambs. We were even able to purchase some of the lamb meat she sells! All in all, it was a really amazing experience and we were grateful for the opportunity to spend time away from the city."
