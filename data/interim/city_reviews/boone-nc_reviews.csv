Stayed one night","What are you waiting for? This was, by far, one of the BEST stays I've had in an AirBNB. The space was welcoming, warm, homey and clean! There are tons of little touches and extras to help you feel right at home. We had no issues and I am already planning a return trip to enjoy the area and this same space again. Everything is labeled, clean, spotless - we easily felt right at home and enjoyed the extra treat of a pizza in the freezer. It was so nice to meet the family, too! They are super kind and sweet spirited and friendly. Do pay attention to those directions! We accidentally came up the gravel road side - but it was a lovely drive and the road is well maintained but Andrews directions are the best way to go. I can't recommend a better place to stay!"

Stayed one night","Loved the personalized welcome mantelpiece. Cozy and incredibly well-designed home. Everything promised on the listing and pre-arrival messages was available and easy to use.
The creek sounds + stargazing at night is a huge win on this property.
100% recommend."

Stayed with kids","I’ve stayed in a lot of Airbnb’s and this place is WONDERFUL. The best place I’ve stayed in with my family, by far. I travel with my two boys, and it was the perfect place to break up our drive. The area is gorgeous- the views and the sound of the creek are just what you need after a long drive. It’s perfect for families, as they had games & outdoor items to get some energy out (frisbees & soccer balls, etc). The accommodations are pristine; they are newly renovated and meticulously cleaned. Andrew & his sweet family go above and beyond to take care of their guests - all the extras and the added touches made me a return guest on my way back. If it’s available, we hope to stay here on our annual trips! LOVED THIS PLACE!!"

Stayed a few nights","This space is a beautiful oasis for weary souls. Andrew’s attention to detail is unmatched. He has truly thought of and proactively met any need you may have during your stay. The cleanliness is impeccable. Great water pressure. Very comfortable accommodations, especially the king size bed with memory foam. The environment is truly memorable with the sound of the adjacent creek, stargazing and firefly sightings at night by the fireside. Such generous hospitality and so much value for the price. Wish we could keep this gem for ourselves but everyone should get to experience this level of rest and care. So grateful we found this place and hope to return."

Stayed a few nights","Me and my friends stayed here and we had so much fun. The carpets are soft enough to sleep on, the couches and beds feel like home, and the hardwood was easy to keep clean.
The kitchen was stocked with everything we needed (including spices). Each guest is given a little basket of stuff to use in case they forgot anything, and it came in handy. The wash room was very nice, with a basin next to the washing machine.
On our second day there, we went and explored the woods and creek on the property. there were benches following the creek, and bridges to get across. We had so much fun exploring the woods and spent over an hour just walking around.
On the night of the second day, we accidentally locked our keys in the car, so we texted the host. He was super helpful with providing a locksmith company and even trying himself to get the door open. We left a little after the check-out time and he was super understanding about it.
We loved the house, and we'll definitely book here again!"

We loved every single detail, including the snacks, pizza, wine and beer he had for us, as well as the surroundings. The sound of the creek beside the house along with the flowers and peaceful nature really made us feel disconnected from our hectic routines."

Stayed one night","The best Airbnb experience ever. I’ve stayed in more than 20 Airbnbs on 4 continents and this was the best experience ever. Andrew has set the bar high and has set a new gold standard for both hospitality and value. The unit is quite large, peaceful, and immaculate. Also Andrew remembers what most hosts forget, that the final B in Airbnb stands for breakfast. Andrew had food and drinks waiting for us upon arrival and coffee and yogurt for us in the morning. My only regret is that I only stayed one night."

The space itself is spotless, comfortable, modern and there wasn't a single thing that Andrew didn't do to prepare for our stay and make us feel welcome. Just a gorgeous space -- anytime I am in Boone I'll stay here if I can. Thank you!"

Booked when I need it next. 😂 very pristine inside, everything is new. Everything you might have left at home is there for you! A welcome sign personalized with our names was the BEST.

Andrew’s place is the definition of a southern hospitality BNB! It’s worth 10+ stars!!! Even my teenager was impressed and you know teenagers are difficult to impress!! Will definitely return with my family again.

Stayed one night","This was by far the BEST host we have had in all of our stays thru Airbnb! Not only did it have everything we needed - this host thought of things to make our stay better that wasn't even on our radar! The thoughtfulness and planning that went into this stay was rockstar status!
From asking our preferences of drinks, temp and diffuser sent before we arrived to having goodies, snacks and even eye masks for sleeping - this place had it ALL. My husband slept so well - he made me ask what kind of mattress the host had! :)
The setting was very peaceful and we enjoyed sipping our coffee on the porch overlooking the creek. But not so secluded that you have to drive far to get into town.
Cannot recommend this place enough!!"

There were cute personal touches and the place was very comfortable. This was by far the cleanest Airbnb I have ever stayed in. Me and my partner felt cared for and relaxed. The hosts genuinely care about your experience and it feels like they set it up with all the things they would want if they were on vacation. 10/10 recommend!

Stayed a few nights","Kimberly's A-Frame Cabin was exactly what we were looking for. Something remote where we could get away for the weekend, but be close enough to a town center to eat out a little and walk around. Kimberly was also an EXCELLENT host, with less than usual Check-out instructions, which is greatly appreciated.
The cabin isn't necessarily remote, like what'd I'd think in Pigeon Forge for instance, as it's located on a semi-neighborhood like road, but the directions the windows face coupled with the change in elevation and the tree cover really give a feeling of privacy."

We truly loved being there, from the twinkle lights upstairs to the cozy living room, every single detail was perfection. It's very easy to find and the directions provided were extremely helpful. We cooked dinner every night in the kitchen, which was stocked with everything we needed to make delicious meals. The scenery is gorgeous and the cabin is private while being centrally located. We never had to drive far to get where we wanted to go. Kimberly was a fantastic host, responding to messages quickly, and was friendly and helpful. This was one of our best Air BnB experiences yet, and we can't wait to return!"

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I just stayed here for our honeymoon and it was an absolute dream!! The cabin is even cuter and dreamier in person than in the pictures. Kimberly was so kind and responsive. There is a neighboring cabin immediately next door, and we were able to hear a number of cars going up the hill next to the cabin throughout the day, but it was never enough to be disruptive or annoying. We stayed here during the first week of January and despite the cold there was so much to do in the area- delicious food, cute stores, and beautiful hikes & scenery. Appalachian ski mountain was a blast and access to the Blue ridge parkway is within a 20 minute drive. Could not recommend this cozy place any more!!!!"

The location is convenient to Boone (approx 2 miles). We also ventured over to Banner Elk and did a couple of hikes while in the area. Kimberly provided a couple of recommendations. One was the Stickboy Bread Kitchen which was amazing.
We would definitely recommend staying here and hope to return in the future."

Stayed a few nights","I've submitted a few reviews for Kimberly's 'Cozy Owl' AirBnB & I try not to say the same things over & over, but it's hard not to.
Reason being, this place & this host are so incredible that there are few words that actually do it justice.
We've based our trips to Boone on the dates this particular cabin is available, and only hope we get so lucky in the future to be able to book it near/on the week of our anniversary (which is what brings us here each year).
This place is charming, beautiful, cozy, close to downtown Boone, still tucked away in the woods to feel secluded. And it has everything you could think of, including things you wouldn't know you needed until you're there.
Kim is a really special host & you'll definitely have a more enjoyable & relaxing stay here than probably most other AirBnBs locally for all those reasons.
Worth booking every single time!"

Kimberly's cabin caught our eye and we are so glad we got to stay at the Cozy Owl Cabin. We both enjoyed the outside deck, swing, and small trail to the creek. My friend loved the loft and we both thought this cabin was the perfect combo of peaceful but within an easy distance to town. Kimberly was responsive, friendly, and a great host. We hope to come back in the future!"

Stayed a few nights","Fabulous little cabin - my friend & I stayed there when we came to Boone to see the Highland Echoes show at the Appalachian Theater. The cabin is a short drive into the busy part of town. The location is very quiet & private, yet easy access to the two-lane highway. The cabin was so clean, neat, such a great use of space, & so thoughtfully decorated that it appeared ready for a photo shoot. Every little detail was thought of, including not only little decorative touches but also what a traveler might need during their stay. It's very well cared for; there's no cloud of Febreze when you open the door as if the owner is hiding odors. If you are a runner, you may want to drive somewhere to go for your daily run. The hill up to the cabin is @ .4 miles (at least according to my watch). It's a challenge for doing hill repeats, & I mean that in a good way. But if you're going for a flat run, the two-lane highway has no shoulder. Attempting that hill for 2 days was enough for me. :-)"

The directions were very detailed and made finding the property very straightforward. The keyless entry into the cabin meant we could checkin on our own time and not have to bother the host. The cabin was exactly as described, spotless, and peaceful. The back porch was huge with plenty of seating under the tall, beautiful trees. The area was quiet and peaceful. The location was close enough to restaurants and shops, but still removed enough to be nestled among nature. We highly recommend this cabin and host. Thank you for an amazing stay! We can’t wait to be back!"

Her A-Frame is very clean, nicely decorated, and it has so much natural light. Not only is it beautiful and well kept on the inside, but on the outside as well.
Our family felt at home with the large windows, beautiful creek in the distance, and of course the warmth of the fireplace in the living room. I would have to say our favorite part of this cabin was the loft. This room was so special because of the large windows, natural light, and the cozy vibes.
We truly loved this cabin and hope that many others get to experience Kimberly's cabin the way we did. Thank you so much for welcoming us into your home, Kimberly."

Stayed a few nights","Whatever I could possibly say about Kimberly's Cozy Owl Cabin or about her as a host & person could never do justice.
The home itself is perfect for a couple looking to get away, while simultaneously being super close to downtown Boone (<7 min drive) & the Blue Ridge Parkway.
Location is a win.
It's an immaculate cabin with every single inch being planned out and used to accommodate guests.
Everything in the house seems to be their for a reason. Kimberly has anticipated everything you'd want to have in an AirBnB and then she's optimized it to make your life easier.
The 1st time we stayed here, I was walking around thinking ""it'd be nice to have X, Y, Z"" ...and sure enough, those exact things would be there.
^ You'll only know what I'm talking about when you stay.
Kimberly is one of the sweetest people I've never met.
The home wouldn't be what it is without her. She takes a home & turns it into an experience.
You could have literally everything else go wrong on your trip & as long as you booked here then you'd still have a great, relaxing time.
Book it. Enjoy it. Then book it again & again like we have & will continue to do."

Not only is the home itself warming, but so is Kimberly; a wonderful host! As long as she'll have us, we're going to make this an annual summer getaway. Thank you, Kimberly!"

Stayed one night","I only stayed for one night while visiting my nephew at App, but I just loved this little hut! It's the perfect size for a solo trip but would also be great for a couple or small family, and it's very affordable compared to other places in the area. There are some other houses close by but the front door faces away from them so you get the effect of almost total solitude. The weather was balmy when I arrived so I opened the door and windows (after turning off the heat of course) and the sound of the little steam that runs right outside the door filled the entire house. It was so peaceful and idyllic. The hut itself was incredibly clean and comfortable and cute as a button! Jason responded quickly and courteously when I messaged him with a question. All in all a wonderful place to stay and I hope I'll have the pleasure of staying there again next time I visit Boone!"

We were there for one night - my husband and our two kids. The kids loved the loft area. It was their own little space, which allowed us the downstairs area. The couch was cozy, the kitchen was well stocked and the shower was amazing! I saw that in the reviews and couldn’t wait to see what the hype was about. It was spacious enough and the water pressure was perfect. It was really cold when we were there so we didn’t get to take advantage of the beautiful scenery. But we did love the sound of the creek and see the fire pits that were available. We really loved our experience!"

The shower is one of the favorite ones of my entire life – no joke! The kitchen is surprisingly well appointed. One thing to note for – the Blue Ridge Parkway is currently closed within that area for construction, unrelated to weather. This significantly impacted my travel time to local venues. It’s certainly not the host or listing’s fault - i’m just noting it here for future occupants’ research."

It felt like we were much more remote than we actually were. it rained while we were there which was fine bc we spent the morning drinking coffee on the porch looking at the Christmas tree farm and listening to the rain on the tin roof. The beds were incredibly comfortable. Everything was wonderful and we will stay again!

The kitchen had everything we needed. Our 5 and 7 year-old boys loved playing in the stream just outside the door. There is also a larger stream maybe 100ft out the door that we explored. The sound of water can be heard outside and contributes to the peaceful nature of the property. We absolutely loved our stay and highly recommend it to anyone seeking a peaceful retreat not far from Boone.

Stayed a few nights","We had an amazing stay at Jason’s place! It was quiet—a few neighbors, but generally private area down a dirt road and only a 20 minute drive to Boone. The space is small and very quaint, we were provided everything that we needed! The welcome book contained lots of good information about the town (places to eat, night life, things to do, etc) as well as clear check out instructions. Our only problem was the front door doesn’t have any kind of covering on it—all glass. And while it does face the woods/creek with no neighbors in that direction, we were a little unsettled by it at night! That might have been because we were unfamiliar with the area and the neighborhood, but nonetheless, something to cover the door with when it got dark would have made us feel a little more comfortable. All in all, amazing place at an even better price!"

Make sure to read the welcome book as there is a detailed checkout/cold weather procedure. Also, the wood stove is off limits which was a little disappointing but understandable for an Airbnb.
Only hiccup we had was that when we arrived, the previous guests were still checking out. The hosts apologized and told us we could wait or come back later, we went into town for dinner and when we came back everything was good to go. To be fair, we booked on very short notice so I understand if the hosts were surprised by our quick arrival.
Overall, it’s a beautiful rental on a beautiful property. Everything was clean and organized. I had a great stay."

The trail around the house was very peaceful to walk. The communication with Jason was awesome! Thank you. We even saw a shooting star!
The sound of the creek was plus!
Two things we didn’t expect were we thought the house was totally surrounded by nature but there are a couple houses close by. (One is right next to this house)
And Monday morning was a little noisy with the commercial vehicles and big delivery truck passing by…Weekend might be more quiet:)
But we made a fire and my kids explored nature and we could spend very peaceful night. We needed it. Thank you."

House is situated in a beautiful surrounding, so peaceful and calm, it was very clean, loved the shower. Will definitely stay again if we come to Boone. BTW Jason, if you ever decide to sell it, let me know please, my wife loved it."

Stayed with kids","I normally don't give reviews, but this little cabin deserves a great one!
If you want to have the cabin/tiny house experience in the mountains this is a perfect place. We are a family of 3 and we all loved it! Our son absolutely didn't want to leave, he enjoy the loft space so much. We played games, made food, listened to music, took naps, and had hot showers. There is a little creek that runs right through the entrance on the porch which makes the experience even more pleasant.
AS a germophobic, I do struggle every time I travel. This cabin was clean, and the bathroom and kitchen which are my top 2 areas were very clean. They did a good job covering all the aspects, in terms of supplies and essentials. My favorite things were the hooks, baskets, and dimmer lights all around the house. We were very pleased and will definitely come back in the fall."

Only strange thing is when I booked I sent a messages or two just introducing myself and thanking the host for having me, and was met with complete radio silence. 🤷🏽‍♂️ There also weren’t anything with local recommendations (a lot of places have this now, which is always super helpful), which was a bummer.

The place was super cute, clean, and homey. It’s in a great location that’s right off King street, so it was easy to walk to restaurants and shops. The only thing that I had an issue with was the noise from passing work trucks early in the morning. But I’m sure if you bring some earplugs you’ll be just fine! Overall, I loved my stay here and I’d definitely recommend it!"

The apartment had all of the amenities you would need for a short stay. I only had two complaints, both easily resolved. The bed was a bit firm for our liking ( I knew this going in as another reviewer mentioned it). A mattress topper would have made it perfect. And though I appreciate the fancy oat milk, it is no substitute for half and half in coffee. Also, I think the oat milk was bad. I shook it up but there were still tons of particles that ruined my first cup of coffee. The French press was nice, and so were the tasty cranberries and nuts. Thanks for a wonderful stay."

The Blue Ridge Parkway is within close proximity to Boone and offers many opportunities, for great views of the Blue Ridge Mountains, hiking and picnicking. Downtown Boone is within walking distance of The Green Nest and offers many great places to eat and shop. The neighborhood was quiet and off-street parking was provided."

It made our stay more comfortable that Catherine had the forethought and intention to be environmentally responsible. Catherine responsiveness to messages was phenomenal!

The studio apartment was just enough space for all of us to fit comfortably and we didn’t have an issue with a sleeping arrangement between the bed and futon. The apartment came with everything we needed for the weekend and we didn’t have to worry about kitchen appliances or basic amenities. Catherine left behind extra toiletries, snacks and more, free to use. The apartment was beautifully decorated and felt like home, as well as in the perfect location. The home is located on a quiet and slow street that was only a five minute walk to downtown. Ideally, we were only fifteen minutes from App Ski Mtn and 12 minutes from Walmart and other grocery stores. We are thankful to have found such a good stay on the short notice. This home is priced well and very affordable. I definitely plan to stay here again."

The apartment was very spacious and there is a HUGE projector TV that was an excellent end to the day. There is a binder on the table with wonderful instructions and recommendations for things to do in town I wish I was staying a little longer to check out all the fun things to do. Defiantly will have to keep this in mind should I be in the area again.

Stayed a few nights","My daughter and I were in Boone to search for an apartment, as she is transferring in to App State this fall. We felt right at home in this cozy space! We loved the attention to all of the details. Although we didn't really have time to take in a movie, the vast collection of DVD's was very impressive! Both the bed and the futon were very comfortable for sleeping. This space was just exactly perfect for the two of us during our stay in Boone. Thank you, Lucas and Linda!"

The products, too, were environmentally and people friendly. We were only there a night, but Earth Fare is great for groceries."

The shower was perfect, nice hot water with good pressure after hiking all day is the best. Communication with host was good and notes around the place helped with any extra info which may be needed. I would definitely book this spot again next time I come to Boone. I would recommend to anyone looking for an unfussy, understated, convenient, and cozy place to stay. Happy travels :)"

If you're going up here in the warmer months, I would suggest asking the host to open the windows before you arrive or put in the window unit. It was a little humid when we arrived, but we contacted The host and they were more than willing to accommodate.

Stayed a few nights","Really nice secluded spot, if that's what you're looking for. The home was welcoming and comfortable. There's a few reviews on the driveway however keep in mind it is in the mountains, gravel and well maintained. Accessibility is fine driving a standard vehicle, as the host stated only during winter months ""with snow"" would the need for 4-wheel drive arise. The main access road is 20 feet off the front porch to another property further up however, we never seen any vehicles travel by. Blowing Rock is within 20-30 minutes using Old Turnpike Rd., ""gravel and well maintained"". The cabin is well centralized to all the area mountain attractions. Beds were super comfortable. Kitchen is well stocked for cooking and eating. For the coffee drinkers, there's a Keurig and standard coffee maker available. The back deck overlooks the downward side of the ridge so deer travel across the property, beautiful sight. I highly recommend this cabin for peaceful getaway."

Check in was a breeze and I loved how there was a binder of clear instructions on everything. The cabin was beautiful and very clean, beds were super comfortable. My kids enjoyed the loft area, toys, and board games. This was by far our best Airbnb experience yet. I did have a minor panic attack on the last 2 miles to get to the cabin lol, but if you’re used to driving in the mountains, or not a wimp like me I guess you’ll be fine! Christopher was friendly and quick to respond when we had questions. There was plenty to do near by and Blowing Rock is approx. 20 min away. I can’t say enough good things about this place, I definitely hope to stay again soon!"

Stayed with a pet",Lazy Bear Cabin was even more than we expected. The four of us and one dog had plenty of room inside and outside. It was cool so we really didn't use the deck but we did take a walk and explored a bit. We had some trouble with the tv but only because we are not smart tv savy and I couldn't remember my sign in for the apps. We saw two deer which was fun for all of us. The fireplace was perfect for cool weather. I would suggest arriving for the first time in daylight. The kitchen is very well equipped and I like the Keurig. The beds are really comfy. I can't think of anything I would change in the cabin. Boone was a bit busier than we expected but with map app on phone we were able to find our way to where we wanted to go. There is plenty to do in the area and the cabin offers peace and quiet when you want to relax. Great trip.

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I booked this small vacation to celebrate our 46th anniversary with some relaxation in a quiet place. This cabin seemed to fit the bill according to the reviews posted. After the first mile on the bumpy gravel road, I began to rethink that decision. When we did finally reach the cabin, it didn't quite match up to the photos of the exterior. The outside furnishings were weathered and dirty. Entry was a simple process though. The inside of the cabin was clean except for some food scraps that had been left in the kitchen sink. The furnishings were beautiful. We were a little unnerved that there are no curtains or blinds on the doors or windows. It is very secluded so I guess they thought there was no need for them. Still took some getting used to. Cell service was very spotty at the cabin. Most essentials were well stocked although we only could find 3 wash cloths in the cabin. If you like secluded places down a long, winding, bumpy gravel road this cabin is for you."

Stayed with kids","We had a wonderful stay at the cabin! It's even cuter and cozier than the photos. The space was great for our family (2 young boys and a newborn) but could have accommodated a couple more people as well. The kids really loved the toys available to them- huge bonus! The property is really beautiful- a very scenic drive off of the main road and very serene with only 3 hours in the area. Like other reviews mentioned, we saw deer in the backyard every day! Given the privacy of the road, it was easy to walk our dog around the area. Although we didn't take advantage of it, we really appreciated the piles of wood available should we want an indoor or outdoor fire.
One thing to note (which isn't reflective of this property, but of the area)-- on a Saturday night in the fall, we tried 4 takeout/pizza places who were not able to provide takeout given how busy they were, so you may want to stock up with a few items from the grocery just in case.
We will definitely be back to stay here!"

From comfortable beds and a well stocked kitchen to excellent wifi, this cabin is great for friends or family wanting a mountain retreat. Very comfortable gathering spaces, both inside and outside. The area is also lovely, as there is hiking nearby. We even saw and enjoyed deer with most walks. Easy to get to Boone, Banner Elk, and Blowing Rock."

Due to rain we weren't able to get out and do the hiking and waterfalls that were so close by, but found the cabin cozy and comfortable to just relax in and enjoy a nice home cooked meal and play board games. Very quiet and peaceful. Very clean and well stocked. Comfortable beds. Adequate blankets and pillows. Very easy to get to and not that far from town and outdoor activities. Would highly recommend."

Stayed a few nights","Great place, very well stocked, very clean and in a very peaceful setting. Head and shoulder above most Airbnbs, and I've stayed in quite a few. Would highly recommend. One caveat though. If you are towing and/or riding motorcycles, the road to the cabin is rideable if you are careful, but does have loose gravel and is rutted in places. Also the road off the main one to the cabin is quite narrow if you are towing anything other than a small trailer. The parking beside the cabin is adequate for cars, but difficult, although doable, with a trailer."

The backyard scenery was beautiful. I made sure to enjoy the swinging hammocks during early morning. Kitchen was stocked full of everything we needed to cook up a few homemade meals. The rooms were clean. The fireplace was the perfect touch as we enjoyed game night and a Netflix movie. It truly felt like home away from home, and after long hours of hiking, it was such a treat to kick back and relax in such cozy quarters. If you’re feeling the need to take some time for yourself, this is the place to do so. Thanks again!"

Stayed a few nights","Overall a nice house in a pretty setting. Everything was clean and in working order. The beds were comfortable and cozy. Sound does travel in the house, so if you’re there with a family it could be a little noisy. There were a couple of blips which Christopher responded to and handled promptly.
A couple of things we weren’t aware of that would have been nice to know…
Bath soap is not supplied, only liquid hand soap. Had we known we would have packed some. Seems minor, but the liquid hand soap supplied is not something that most people would want to clean their body with.
The bigger issue for us was the requirement to pack up your garbage and drive it to the local dump site yourself. Never had to do that before and expected it to be covered by the cleaning fee."

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at this cabin was wonderful! Like others have said, it feels very secluded but is close to many things the area has to offer. Grandfather Mountain was about thirty minutes away, The Blowing Rock was less than 15, and we found an excellent park nearby called Valle Crucis that was about ten minutes where we did all our fly fishing. The cabin was very clean, the kitchen was well stocked, and it had a great area in the basement for the kids (when they weren't playing outside). We used the outdoor fire pit multiple times and it was so nice to watch the sky get dark outside by the fire. The host always responded quickly, and access with the keypad was simple. If we ever head back here in the future, we will be sure to check and see if this place is available!"

Far away from it all and surrounded by forest, but only a 15-30 min drive to most every thing we wanted to do! We enjoyed rock climbing, mountain biking, nearby waterfalls and relaxing at the Lazy Bear on the back porch after all the fun! Cabin was super clean. Comfortable and well furnished. All we needed to cook meals at home was available. Great value for the Boone area. Comparable places seemed to charge a lot more. Only thing to note, if you aren’t familiar with mountain driving arrive during the day. It’s a short windy drive up a gravel road for a few miles to get to the cabin. The location is fantastic and everything we were hoping for during a week in the mountains."

Stayed a few nights","As always, Aaron and Kerry's place is home away from home. It is my new go to spot in Boone when I am by myself and need a quiet, clean, convenient, and comfortable place to stay. The perfect basement apartment with its own entrance is beside a quaint creek. Small but thoughtful touches are evident throughout. Can't say enough about this property!"

The hosts were so kind and friendly! We felt really safe and relaxed! It was almost like being at home ❤️"

Location is good for walking to downtown.
Very clean. Comfortable bed.
Host is what you need! Non-invasive but very responsive.
This stay is perfect for single or a couple. More than two people is doable but better be a small person.
Note: These are not negatives in any way, just facts. If you are 6”2 or taller, be careful to duck! Also, lots of height changes(step up /step down) on entry area. Kinda of a tight squeeze, too!
Will definitely go back to this place!!!"

Checkin instructions were super clear, so even at that time in the night, it was no problem. The yard is so pretty, sadly we didn't have enough time to enjoy the woods and stream. Initially the hosts said there would be an air mattress for the 3rd person but they had managed to get a nice twin bed before our trip - so it was a comfortable stay. As mentioned in the description the place is tiny (the shower is extremely small) but it worked well for us. Although it is a tiny place it had everything needed. Thank you again."

Stayed a few nights","Aaron and Kerry are great hosts and their room is a great option for a visit to Boone! The room and accompanying bathroom were spotless and well furnished and decorated. The space felt very cozy and comfortable during my stay. I liked the thoughtful touches of various snacks and coffee options as well.
The location itself is great too with downtown Boone and Appalachian State a short walk away. In addition, the location is only a short drive away from many other area attractions such as an endless amount of hiking, breweries, and more. I would highly recommend this listing to anyone looking to stay in Boone!"

It was a lovely stay and I would definitely book with them again.

Stayed one night","I cannot say how exceptionally accommodating Aaron and Kelly were. I had last minute delivery I needed for my project in Boone and had to have it overnighted. While I was already checked out the hosts were amazing and helpful in receiving that package and communicated beautifully with me every step of the way so that I received it.
Even though I did not meet the hosts directly they’re care and consideration for me and my “high maintenance” issue speaks to the character of the individuals and just shows that they do indeed care.
Highest praise."

Aaron & Kerry made the whole process so easy and provided us with a very detailed guide to local trails, restaurants, entertainment options etc so we were able to plan out our trip well in advance. We really appreciated that they thought of everything that could make our stay most comfortable - coffees, waters, teas, toiletries, etc where all top notch and I was excited to see they had a white noise machine at bedside (even though we certainly didn’t need it here!) The bed was comfortable and the temperature was just right. It was great to be within walking distance of so many restaurants and a health-focused grocery store. We wish we could have stayed longer and look forward to coming back again!"

The night I was there was chilly but the space heater provided warmed the place up quickly and the comforter on the bed was super warm. You can tell a lot of thought was put into the amenities, from the snacks to the extra toothbrush in the bathroom in case a guest forgot theirs. My only complaint was that I had no cell signal in the unit but that’s on my provider, not the hosts. But the wifi worked great at least. I would definitely try to stay here again if I’m in the area."

Stayed with kids","Aaron and Kerry’s cozy accommodations were absolutely perfect in every way. Easy walking distance to the heart of town and campus (first college visit for my senior!) cleaner than most hotels I’ve been in, and if you have ADHD when you’re packing and forgot your toothpaste (like I did) or toothbrush (like my daughter did) or shampoo (we packed two conditioners. Why?? Ha) you’re going to open a cabinet in the bathroom and see that your morning has not been ruined by your own stupidity- they’ve already saved your day. :) Even down to the little things you always wish you’d have in a temp kitchen outside if cups, flatware, and bowls, like ziplock bags to store leftovers, a cutting board, and wine glasses. Oh and did I mention the chocolate? Sweet welcoming touch!
The bed was very comfortable, outlets for charging on each side of the bed are readily accessible, it’s easy to check in and lock up, and it’s quite spacious with room to work if needed (big desk and comfy chair, wifi is strong.)
There are even books and games for any down time, though no table for your card games or take out- we made do with the chairs and clever little wedge-shaped side table. If I had stayed longer I would definitely have taken a cool morning to sit out on the patio with coffee to watch the wildlife beyond the little creek that runs through the backyard. As we were packing the car we watched a mama and 2 baby deer getting breakfast.
I’m so glad we chose to stay here, and if my daughter ultimately chooses App State, I know where I’ll be staying for my future visits. No hesitation."

Stayed a few nights","Jason’s place was perfectly located. Close to anything you could want in Boone. We parked on day one and didn’t touch our car again until we left 4 days later.
The apartment was as described, with one exception - the restaurant below is now a breakfast place (Famous Toastery - they have great food and staff), which means the kitchen noises start at about 6:30 AM, but they are closed by 2:00 PM, so nothing in the evening. We turned the fan on the window unit to high whenever we were in bed and it did a pretty good job of drowning out noise from the street at night and from downstairs in the morning.
This is the second time I’ve stayed in one of Jason’s places in this same building. Between the location and Jason being a great host, it’s the first place I check when I’m headed to Boone. Would definitely stay again."

Stayed a few nights","Great location! Very worth the stay. Had a great time, had a hard time deciding where to eat. Right in the middle of the action. Bring a fan to help with the road noise, wasn’t a big deal I sleep with a fan anyways. It’s an old building with lots of character which we love!"

Stayed a few nights","King Suite on King Street is a great spot to be in the middle of everything in downtown Boone! We loved the historic building and the ability to walk to shops and restaurants. There’s plenty of space for two people and, my favorite, the best sheets I have ever slept on. They’re Biltmore brand sheets, yes I looked!
Our host, Jason, was very responsive. His instructions were clear and exact. This was our first time using AirBnb and it was a great first experience!
Jason explained in the description that there would be noises associated with downtown living, mainly due to the restaurant downstairs. Honestly the restaurant closed daily at 2pm and we never heard them. We did hear noises from traffic but with the location that was to be expected.
I would absolutely stay at this or another AirBnb that Jason hosted."

The stairs leading up to the unit are fairly steep, but the unit is spacious and has plenty of room for two people. The bed was super comfortable.
The parking spot is a little bit of a walk, but parking is so tough in Boone that it was definitely a perk to have the space.
Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay there again. Jason was very responsive to the any questions we had."

Stayed a few nights","The place was exactly as pictured, and the messages from the host were templates. This space and the experience felt built of a checklist, and not that meant some challenges and annoyances that could be avoided if the host tried out the space of experienced it through the guest's eyes. It was 40 degrees outside the day we arrived, and the heat wasn't on. To get it on in the main room we had to move furniture and the TV. The blankets were soft but thin, not designed for cold mountain nights. There was only one towel bar (with the hand towel) and no hooks for towel to be reused the next day. The water was grainy and un-drinkable, quite the suprise when brushing your teeth. It was also much louder in the evenings than advertised. Even with a white noise machine, we could hear traffic, and music well past midnight on weekdays Jason has some kinks to work out, but it's a good space."

No one knew the origins of the smell. Had a floor fan and opened windows and after 3 days, the smell remained. Don't know if Jason ever physically came to assess the situation. The bathtub/shower and kitchen sink are feed with the same cold water line. Very little cold water flowed. The shower was barely usable due to not being able to regulate the hot water with cold. Informed Jason and he indicated they would be contacting a plumber to assess."

The basement apartment was perfect - comfy couch, great kitchenette, and even a deer wandered over one evening. It's in a shared house, so there are minimal other noises, but I regularly live with teenagers and they're loud. Neighborhood is safe and very pretty to walk through. The entire place was spotless (I do yoga in the mornings) so even saw under the bed while on my mat. I will definitely stay again for work trips."

Stayed a few nights",Karen’s home is the perfect High Country getaway. My wife and I felt right at home. Great neighborhood and within walking distance of downtown restaurants and bars. I lived in Boone for several years and loved the area where this home is located. Wonderful weekend getaway.

Stayed a few nights","Our stay in was cozy and comfortable. We had everything we needed. We slept well, water pressure and temperature control was excellent, and both the coffee and tea were tasty. We took several nice walks downtown since we were so close, and if we knew if we ran out of anything, Karen was standing by to help. We would stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights",Karen had a lovely apartment attached to her centrally-located home! It was very clean and was the perfect space for our short weekend in Boone. The house is in a great location and Karen is very hands-off (which we appreciated) but there for whatever you may need! I would definitely stay here again.

Cleanliness is always our main concern and the place is definitely clean. Loved the large size of the yard, very peaceful, beautiful setting. Great proximity to old town Boone and Appalachian State. Will be absolutely looking to book here again!"

I honestly hesitate to say good things because it means more people will want to book it and I won’t be able to get a place there! But it was truly special: clean, fresh, with great amenities including the advantage of seeing deer in our front yard. Close to town, easily walkable, great parking, I loved it."

5 stars all the way!"
