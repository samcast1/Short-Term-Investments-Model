Stayed a few nights","This small house is very nicely decorated in a New Mexico style. The kitchen is big with lots of cooking utensils, and our host provided some fresh eggs from his chickens! The host lives just across the small yard from the house, so handy if you need anything. It was a little strange that one of the bedrooms did not have a door - just an archway into the living room. Otherwise, it was a nice place to rest after our days exploring."

Stayed a few nights","This is a great little house with a lot of character. It is a cozy and comfortable home and I especially loved the details of the curated decor, rugs, and furnishings throughout. The well appointed kitchen allowed us the flexibility to cook (🥰 the gas range and retro fridge). Beds were comfortable and access to TV, WiFi, and an assortment of books was nice for winding down once we were in for the evening. Although they had recently gotten snow, I could imagine having coffee and reading a book on the stunning sun porch had we more time in our visit. Located in a quiet neighborhood and easily walkable to the nearby Plaza. I had the chance to meet both the hosts during our stay (one at their lovely Weave+Gather shop in town and the other stopped by as I was unpacking the car) as they live/work locally. Check in and check out was easy, price was fair given the quality of the home and amenities, and the host was timely and helpful in their communication. Would absolutely stay here again."

Historic bungalow is freshly renovated, the kitchen & bath are bright & beautifully appointed with all one could want. Lovely antiques, intriguing books & ethnic textiles throughout - learn more about by visiting their shop, Weave & Gather, on the Plaza, a treat of local & rare imported treasures. Appreciated energy conservative appliances & heat pumps that maintained VERY comfortable temp in near 100 weather. Rachel even gave me a compost bucket. Will recommend & return.

Stayed a few nights","We are so pleased with our stay -
Jim and Rachel treated us so well. We were greeted with fresh eggs from their coop, and fresh produce. This is a beautiful clean and cozy historic home that they have renovated and decorated with amazing fiber textiles and photos. It’s got a wonderful kitchen. While it’s so conveniently one block from downtown and a quick walk to the university, their home has a wonderful sense of privacy. It’s one of two homes on this acre-sized farm with fruit trees and chickens. The boxer Jack Johnson stayed and trained at the next door neighbor’s house :) Jim and Rachel also own a really beautiful fiber textiles store downtown and will be offering weaving courses, and yoga retreats. We loved our stay in the city of LasVegas and can’t wait to return."

We particularly enjoyed exploring the nearby ridge and cave (watch out for cacti!) with our children, under the guidance of the adorable dog Fluffy. The horses and deer on property were friendly and enjoyable. The impressive Labyrinth, yoga deck and general vibes of the area contributed to a great spiritual energy to our stay. Colin was an attentive and gracious host. We highly recommend and will definitely come back!"

Group trip","This is everything the description. A pristine ranch/retreat center off the beaten path with all of the amenities that you will need. Full kitchen (really nice dishes and utilities), a fully functioning hot tub, and acres upon acres to explore. Go explore the local towns and enjoy the day time excursions, but at night make sure to light the fire and enjoy the clear night sky. I took a group of 10 people here to get away from the craziness of every day life, and Leaping Deer did just that. You are going to love the place so much that you will want your own Leaping Deer swag. Colin is around when needed and happy to answer any questions. He even stayed up late for us to drive into town during a rather tough blizzard with whiteout conditions. Can’t say enough about how incredible this stay was. I fully recommend Leaping Deer Ranch"

The ranch itself is beautiful and each time I visit there seems to be more amenities added. Outdoor movie theatre is now operational. My favorite thing to do is grab a drink and sit on the porch on the wheel bench to watch the setting Sun well into dusk and listen to the crickets. If you ever want to explore northern New Mexico, give Leaping Dear Ranch a try."

Stayed a few nights","The Leaping Deer Ranch is a GREAT place to get-away. Although it appears to be used for larger wedding parties and gatherings, my wife and I were lucky enough to be able to book it for a 4 night anniversary getaway. All was as described in the listing. Colin is responsive and lives on-site. We didn't even scratch the surface of the available outdoor opportunities. A beautiful 20 mile drive to Mora, and a simple 10 mile drive to Las Vegas, you have access to anything you might need. Booking a massage on-site is HIGHLY recommended. Looking forward to a return trip in the warmer months."

Group trip","Leaping Deer Ranch was the perfect location for our small outdoor wedding! Due to COVID-19, we needed to keep our wedding small, and the ranch was the perfect size to accommodate ourselves and our 9 guests. The ranch is spacious and well decorated, which made the perfect backdrop for our reception; the large dining room table was even able to comfortably seat the 11 of us! The location of the ranch is about 1.5-2 hours from an airport, depending on if you fly into Santa Fe or Albuquerque, so our guests rented cars and there was ample parking at the ranch. The ranch is also located ~15 minutes from Las Vegas, NM, which was incredibly convenient for getting groceries. We ordered our reception dinner from The Skillet in Las Vegas, which is a restaurant/bar that also hosts karaoke Thursday nights at 9; the food was delicious and karaoke was a blast! Leaping Deer is also just a great place for hanging out and relaxing. We spent a lot of time in the hot tub, gazing at the stars - we even saw shooting stars! The land itself is stunning and has spectacular views, especially when you hike up the hillside with Fluffy the adorable resident malamute. Our first night there we were also treated to a giant double rainbow right out in front of the ranch! There were a few hiccups here and there, such as the refrigerator in the kitchen being broken, so we relied on a smaller one that was kindly setup for us on the porch. Also, one of our guests found a scorpion in their room, so be careful to always shut doors behind you and don't open windows without screens. All in all, we had a wonderful stay and we're very grateful to Colin and the crew for such a pleasant time!"

Stayed with kids","The Leaping Deer Ranch was the perfect family getaway. We skipped the beach and decided to do a socially distant trip out west, and the ranch did not disappoint! The house was so large that everyone had their own room, with many empty to spare, giving us some much-needed space after months of quarantining together. We enjoyed the extremely well-appointed kitchen, the seemingly endless covered porch, the majestic sunrises across the landscape, and the cozy fireplaces. The kids enjoyed our daily hikes around the property, climbing to find the cave, collecting eggs, and feeding the horses with Colin. We were sad to leave and only wish we could have stayed longer!"

Our party included three generations with two grandparents, two sets of parents, & four kids ranging from 5 to 1 year old. The house is so spacious that everyone commented on how we could easily double the size of our party without any issue. Plus it’s very kid & dog friendly. The kitchen is incredibly well-stocked with appliances, serving ware, & other kitchen essentials (spices, cooking oils, coffee filters, paper towels, etc). The eight-person hot tub is a huge plus & only adds to the luxurious feel of the place. I hope to be back soon & highly recommend Leaping Deer Ranch for its beautiful views of NM vistas, its relaxing vibes, & its come as you are attitude."

We are both into the outdoors but knew we needed to provide comfort and amenities to our guests. Thus, making Leaping Deer Ranch a perfect location for our wedding. Colin (the owner) is extremely professional and the staff were all very helpful. The Master Bedroom has the biggest bathtub I've ever seen. A nice bubble bath was perfect addition to ease away my stress the day before the wedding . Also, the kitchen is a Professional Chef's dream come true! We didn't have our event catered but with the help of this spacious kitchen we were able to prepare enough food (and more) for all 57 of our guests."

Stayed about a week","What a phenomenal experience! This place is 186 acres of magic! We took multiple walks to the gate daily for exercise/view (.65 miles each way). We fed the four friendly horses that roam the property (often times exploring). We ate fresh eggs daily and got to get them from the chickens themselves. We hiked the mountain behind the big house and found a cool cave and a giant hole we called, ""The Pit of Doom"" (it sounds scarier than it is haha). We enjoyed each other's company (was kind of like a family reunion - 13 of us at one point including 6 adults and 7 children; youngest was 4 and it was totally appropriate/not dangerous). We relaxed in the jacuzzi. We ran, we played, we cooked. We shot our pellet gun and crossbow at the range. It was such a special time. Colin was fantastic. At first, the thought of ""sharing"" the ranch didn't seem as appealing. However, we were happy Colin was there and really hardly saw him! There are folks that work there as well, but we hardly saw them too (and they were super friendly when we did). It was a relief Colin was there when we realized we needed things (eggs, horse treats, etc.). It was also nice to get a tour of the place at check-in. We felt like we had the best of both worlds - hospitality and privacy.
Leaping Deer Ranch is magical. We hope to return and I highly recommend you stay there."

Group trip","This ranch is gorgeous, with beautiful views from the ridge and comfortable spaces all over the house, indoors and out. Our large family group of 12 adults and 6 little kids was able to spread out and be comfortable with almost no need to ever leave except to buy more groceries (just 10 miles away!). So much room to play, hike, rest. And the hot tub was large and comfortable for a small crowd.
The kitchen was fantastic for a big group who loves to cook. We really enjoyed the huge range and the convection oven, and the wine fridge!
The place is quality, and a really good price. Colin and his team were accommodating and helpful. HIGHLY recommend this place for a large group gathering or family reunion."

It’s clean, it’s comfortable, the kitchen is a dream for cooking for large groups, and Colin and the other folks on the property are very friendly. I took the time to walk through the labyrinth and it was so cool! It must have taken a lot of effort to build it and I’ve never seen anything like it."

One of it’s best kept secrets is Colin’s cooking. I highly recommend that people who stay here hire the host to prepare their meals. Breakfast, lunch and dinner! They were able to accommodate our different culinary needs - vegan, vegetarian and carnivores. And some of us had the chocolate cake Colin baked for our first night and some said it was the best they have ever had!"

Stayed a few nights","We had our wedding at Colin’s ranch this past weekend and wow I cannot say enough positive things about Colin himself, his ranch hand Matt, and the ranch as a whole.
Not only us, who were partial to the ranch from the start, but every other person who attended our wedding this weekend spoke highly of the ranch and its natural beauty. We all absolutely loved the house, too. The kitchen allowed us to cook breakfast together and enjoy the community of our friends in the days leading up to the wedding and after. The fireplace in the front entrance was perfect for sharing old stories and laughing together. The formal dining room was picturesque and perfect for signing our marriage license in as well as for sharing meals and memories with friends and family. The master bedroom was INCREDIBLE. The tub large enough to comfortably fit two adults was icing on the cake! The bed and pillows were a dream to sleep on, and the candles that were made available throughout the space added a beautiful sense of romance to the place.
My new husband and I enjoyed the rooster crows through the entire weekend and Fluffy, the ranch dog, made each part of the weekend that much more fun. We love dogs and fluffy was perfect have around. She spent time with us on the porch, visited us during our reception, and played with us and our bridal party in one of the grass fields during our photo session just after the ceremony.
Colin and Matt even attended a post-reception bonfire and shared some great stories. Colin also talked to us about the meaningfulness of having our marriage at the center of the rock labyrinth. We were not able to walk the labyrinth in entirety during our stay this time, but we would absolutely love to return with more family and friends in the future to walk the labyrinth make more memories at this beautiful and very special ranch.
Thank you both for a perfect stay."

Group trip","We were looking for a rustic venue, in a majestic setting, for my daughter's wedding where we could house and host a large group of people. Leaping Deer Ranch was perfect. The location of the ranch is nestled in the hills with sweeping vistas. There was a lot of space to gather and relax and on the porches surrounding the ranch house. The kitchen and great room easily accommodate 50+ people . The Kitchen itself had everything we needed including multiple ovens and dishwashers and utensils. Colin was very attentive and quick to respond if we needed anything. All in all , we had a great experience. If you are looking for a secluded, rural location with access to hotels and stores, as well as, hiking and hot springs then Leaping Deer Ranch is your place."

Stayed a few nights","Leaping Deer Ranch is a true gem! We recently had our wedding here and it was everything we dreamed of and more!
Colin is a great host and his property is immaculate. You can feel the hard work and love that he puts into the space. He was extremely helpful in answering our questions and accommodating our needs. He is easy going and truly wants his guests to enjoy their stay.
The ranch housed our entire families comfortably. We had a beautiful ceremony in the outdoor labyrinth and a fun reception in the event hall. We were able to customize the space to our liking and it was great to have tables, chairs, linens, and place settings already available.
The ranch has many other special touches. We enjoyed the beautiful fiber art in the house, the hot tub, fresh eggs from the chickens, visits from the hummingbirds, hikes led by the house dog, Fluffy, the horses, and star gazing at night.
You will enjoy every minute of your stay here. It is so peaceful and serene. We will definitely be back again!"

The hot tub was a fabulous way to unwind after an eventful day. We had our wedding and rehearsal dinner at the ranch and all our guests commented on the beautiful landscape and property. Every one thoroughly enjoyed their stay and Colin was always prompt with answers and available if we had a need. Overall, we had an amazing stay at Leaping Deer!"

Group trip","Our experience at Leaping Deer Ranch was absolutely amazing. After searching through over 30 other venues, we finally found this oasis of tranquility. Colin was a fantastic, and attentive host. From the start, Colin helped us with information about the property & specifics that were invaluable to the planning. From working with the caterer to helping us accommodate our 12 guests, to building a frame for our group activity, he was always gracious, patient and friendly. The property, regardless of the beautiful photos on the advertisement, is understated. Every guest at attendance was blown away by the beauty, peacefulness, and amenities of this wonderful property. We highly recommend Leaping Deer Ranch to any couple or business looking for an event venue. It will probably be considerably less expensive compared to other comparable locations, without sacrificing any of the luxury. A+"

The event space is completely stocked with chairs, plates, etc. Perfect for hosting an event. :) Finally, there was not a single thing we wanted for the entire weekend. Colin is brilliant and kind, and his story with the ranch is an inspiring one. Would absolutely recommend. :)"

The ranch is spacious with spectacular views from every direction. The fully stocked kitchen and grill allowed us to cook for our big group and enjoy spending time with everyone with plenty of space.
We had sides catered for the reception through the Skillet (in Las Vegas), in combination with a roasted pig that Colin and team took care of for us on property. Everything was delicious!
So many of our friends and family told us it's the best wedding they've been to, and we have Colin & Leaping Deer to thank for a big part of that. It was our best day ever. Thank you!"

Stayed a few nights",The leaping deer Ranch is spectacular as was our host Colin and his helper Matt. We had our wedding there and basically a large family reunion. We had between 15 and 20 people sleeping there each night and a family dinner of almost 50 one night followed by a party of over a hundred people the next day. This place and host accommodated us very well. The beautiful indoor and outdoor spaces and even the town of Las Vegas had something for everyone. Our host provided us with a pig roast or matanza which ended up keeping him working until 2 in the morning to get it cooked! We can't thank Colin and Matt enough! We were able to have the most precious ceremony in the middle of the labyrinth with even a little bit of thunder in the distance but under gorgeous New Mexico Blue Skies. This place was magical. Come see it.

Close to the beautiful and historic town of Las Vegas, NM, it’s still remote enough to feel the kind of true seclusion one seeks for a vacation getaway. Didn’t want to leave—my wife now talks of retiring to the area. It’s stunning, day and night. Thanks, Colin!"

Stayed with kids","We knew from the moment we drove up the road across the pasture to this incredible house that we were going to experience a special time. The Leaping Deer Ranch could not have been more perfect for our family reunion. The front double doors open into a grand room with high ceilings and impressive fireplace. The entire home is furnished with comfortable leather couches and chairs. The fully stocked professional kitchen is leaves nothing to be desired.
The house is surrounded by original fiber art and metal sculptures. The bedrooms are resort class with fantastic colorful tile work and plush towels. This is a magical place where our family was able to heal from the loss of a special loved one and welcome a new brother and his wife to our family.
The host could not be more caring than Colin the owner. The ranch has laying chickens that so we were able to enjoy fresh eggs for breakfast each morning. Colin allowed my 4-year-old autistic granddaughter to go with him in the morning to gather eggs from the chickens in the barn. This was so special to her and something she will always remember. Thank you, Colin, you really did something good.

He was quick to respond to texts and calls. The space is great for events. We did our wedding here, and used the event space. It was so much fun! The fire pit was really great and huge!
Cons: one of the employees did try taking a bottle of vodka and a bottle of wine from our reception. That’s not ok! But Colin was notified and spoke with him. We did book yoga and she was 40 minutes late, So if you book yoga make sure you email her the day before to remind her.
Again, Colin was great, the place was amazing! I hope to come back and visit again in the future! Make sure you read the full listings expenses. Overall a great experience!"

We had a group of 8 adults + 10 kids and there was plenty of room for everyone to spread out. We enjoyed the hot-tub, the fireplace, the huge and fully-equipped kitchen, and the comfortable beds and living areas. Colin was the perfect host, communication and check-in were flawless, and he gave our kids a tour of the ranch -- they got to feed the chickens, collect eggs, and take hay out to the field for the horses. The surroundings are extremely quiet and peaceful, with wonderful star-gazing at night just outside the doorstep, and the lovely labyrinth for a meditative walk. Everyone had a wonderful time and we're already talking about coming back. Highly recommended in every way!"

The house is stunning, the setting is beautiful, the amenities are ample, and Colin and his crew run the place professionally. While the house and setting make it worthwhile, the little touches like a supply of fresh eggs from the ranch and Colin's easy-going nature make this not just a good rental but a vacation destination. Note that Colin and the staff stays on the property in a small home nearby, and they strike the perfect balance of being available but not obtrusive. We also loved hiking and exploring the area, and particularly enjoyed hiking Hermit's Peak and visiting the cool outdoor hot springs in Montezuma. We also had a great meal at Charlie's Spic n Span in Las Vegas. We'll be back!"

Group trip","This place exceeded all of our expectations. Our Cousins group was much larger than normal, with a few special circumstances to negotiate. Colin and Sophie were terrific, and made sure we had everything we needed. The accommodations were spacious and private for such a large group including several different 'group rooms' for eating, sharing, and even a slide show presentation (our projector/screen)! Those that got along well could share bedrooms, and a few that needed their own room were very pleased. My immediate siblings and a couple of spouses shared the master bedroom. in our 60's, it felt like a fantastic Mini reunion amongst our immediate family, a unexpected and fun slumber party! I loved the spaciousness of the kitchen, which included three sinks, ample countertops and double dishwashers . I really cannot say enough about this place. The couch beds were a little firm, but I believe that is easily rectified with a topper since they were a more solid modern style and not the formidable spring beds of the 50's. All in all...we can't wait to return on our next (now annual) Cousins Reunion."

Stayed with kids","My now wife, Anna, and i were looking for a truly special place to have our wedding. a place that not only has all the necessary amenities and logistical advantages, but that also has a unique, serene feeling, wide-open vistas, a sense of place and authenticity. we feel beyond lucky that we found Leaping Deer Ranch.
in our attempt to keep our wedding compact, simple, and go-with-the-flow, we wanted to accept the imperfections and mix-ups that are par for the course when you keep it a little loose. the funny thing is, by being open to the imperfect, everything worked out perfectly.
the property is a stunner, the layout, the landscape, the fire pit, the labyrinth (largest in New Mexico, apparently); the house itself is at once spacious and cozy, beautifully appointed, a place that accommodates the max guest capacity with total ease. the event hall was the perfect size for our group meals and our highly successful dance-off of a reception. i mean, everybody got up and danced, even the grandmas. so dang fun! and our ceremony--replete with big puffy clouds and darkening rosy-blue sky at dusk-- took place in the middle of that big, beautiful labyrinth. again, perfect.
Anna and i absolutely, completely loved the experience and the feeling of being at Leaping Deer. both our families couldn't (and still can't) stop crowing about how beautiful and peaceful and magnificent the ranch is, and how perfect it was for our wedding. i'm so happy that they're going to walk away with such vivid and deeply fond memories of the event and the place. and Anna and i will cherish our memories of this weekend forever.
and, by the way...Collin is awesome. always on-point and helpful and fun to talk to.
if you're thinking about staying here, do yourself a favor and just book it now. thank Collin for the memories later..."

Stayed one night","WOW! We had our daughter's wedding at Leaping Deer Ranch this past weekend and it was AMAZING! The guests were so impressed and many said it was the most beautiful wedding they had ever been to.
We were looking for a place that we could have a small (75 people) wedding where we could stay and also have some family time. This was the JACKPOT! The home is truly amazing and the hall was perfect. Colin and his staff made sure we had everything we needed for the entire time.
The bride's family stayed in the beautiful main house and the groomsmen stayed in the apartment behind the hall. It could not have worked out better. The kitchen is a dream! So much space and it had everything we needed. The hall also has a kitchen so the caterer was able to work in there while the family was able to do all our work in the house.
Colin provided all the tables and chairs for the hall, which were beautiful wood and would have been beautiful on their own, but he also provided the linen. In addition, he also provided the place settings with nice plates, bowls, coffee cups, stemware and flatware. Perfect!
I cannot say enough good things about Leaping Deer Ranch or their staff. It was an amazing weekend from beginning to end. My family can't wait to go back and enjoy the amazing views, peaceful days, and wonderful accommodations."

We had 3 more late arrival guests show up, and Colin immediately had his staff make-up 3 more beds. Leaping Deer Ranch is a must see, and definitely a must stay!! Thank you Colin and staff for being so awesome! Extra thanks to Phil for the bonus fun! We will definitely be returning! We LOVED everything this place and the land had to offer!!"

The home is amazing, has a lot of little details that make it extra luxurious and special, and it would be perfect for a retreat or special getaway. Colin was also very kind in sharing really cool local things to do that I would never have known to google. I very grateful for the generosity and kindness — it helped make my trip to New Mexico even more special! 5 Stars!"

Stayed a few nights","Wow, what a glorious place this ranch is! My whole family of 12 (including 4 kids) stayed here for the holidays and we were blown away not only by the natural beauty but by the house. The art pieces inside were especially notable. We had everything we needed and didn’t leave the property much, cooking most meals in the enormous kitchen space. The kids were led by one of the ranch hands to feed the horses carrots and other treats on one of the mornings. The horses, four female rescues are truly in heaven on this property. It warmed my heart that they are getting such freedom and loving treatment. Something to note is that a small staff live in the surrounding buildings but we did not find their presence intrusive. Trips to town included meals at Smiling Faces and Charlie’s Bakery both of which had the most friendly wait staff! We also took a trip to the hot springs near UWC campus which all ages of our family enjoyed. You won’t regret the trek out to this beautiful pocket of New Mexico!"

Stayed a few nights","The Leaping Dear Ranch is one of the coolest places I've visited in quite some time. The Airbnb description and photos just can't do it justice. The hacienda is enormous, and very well appointed, with every conceivable amenity. The property is absolutely beautiful, with numerous spots to relax, explore, drink and eat, and recreate. We knew it would fit our needs for a 50th birthday party, but once we arrived we couldn't believe how great of value we were getting for our money.
Colin is an incredible host. He went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. Even though he lives in an apartment on the property, he wasn't at all intrusive, but always available when we needed something. He was very flexible and accommodating, and did everything he could to ensure our experience was an outstanding one. We felt like we made a new friend in Colin, and were lucky to have had such great hospitality.
I highly recommend The Leaping Deer Ranch to anyone looking for a unique, warm, welcoming, and entertaining experience. The Ranch is perfect for a variety of uses. We definitely plan to return!"

Stayed about a week","If you are looking for an elegant stately upscale and larger than life home in the setting of expansive nature, this is the place to be. The sky is big, the land is beautiful and the home is well appointed. It has everything needed to accommodate a large group.
We were 19 in number, and had plenty of spaces inside and outside the home to visit and move about. The kitchen is enormous and well stocked for a professional chef to provide gourmet meals. Extra tables and chairs were provided, which allowed us to create both indoor and outdoor dining spaces.
The living room is huge with ample seating clusters. The grand fireplace was well stocked with wood and restocked by the manager. Overall, the home and the grounds provided the perfect setting for long and rich conversations, walks and hikes.
We used the 40 x 40 foot meeting room, complete with extra kitchen, for our program and it was spectacular. The bank of windows provided the connection to nature with easy access to a cover porch where participants could easily walk all around the house and stay out of the weather.
This is one of the most spectacular retreat homes we have been in, but what makes is so special is the love and care that owner Colin and manager Fred take to ensure that we had all that was needed for creating a special environment for one and all. They were always on the ready to ensure that we had what was needed, and if it was not readily available, they quickly provided it.
We hope to return!"

The amenities allowed us to have a relaxing time after all of the work that we got done - the inclusion of a hot tub, bonfire pit, and gas grill really added to our experience. The home is situated in a gorgeous locale so if peace, quiet and beauty are what you are looking for this is definitely the place to stay. Colin and Fred were available to help us out with anything we needed without being in the way. They are excellent hosts and this house is amazing!

Stayed a few nights","We had a group of ten (10) guys who were there for a bachelor party. We were all in our thirties and for the most part all married, so a traditional venue and game plan was not going to work for us. After much searching and hand wringing I came upon Leaping Deer. We were fortunate to have found this space. It was exactly what we needed and gave the groom a huge space to take a deep breath before the deep dive into marriage. Fred and Colin could not have been more helpful and accommodating. At first, I was skeptical having them on site, but in hindsight was quite relieved to have them there. I am working to organize a reunion for both bachelorettes and bachelors at Leaping Deer. In addition, I will be working with some other groups to host events and retreats. This property and it's hosts are well suited for large groups and the internal reflection that comes with open vistas and a the solitude of being in nature. Except there is plenty of amenities and modern comforts without being obtrusive. Thanks again Colin and Fred!"

Stayed a few nights","If you are looking for a remote working Ranch with all of the amenities to make you feel welcomed, then this is the place for you. Nestled in the foothills of the northern New Mexico mountains, Leaping Deer Ranch has everything that will make you and your guests feel welcomed. Beautiful prairie and mountain views and lots of space to gather with friends and family. We sat outside on the wrap around porch start gazing one night. Great place and we will definitely be back again. Most people might not venture towards Sapello, NM; however, this would be a great base camp for all of your northern New Mexico adventures.
We didn't use all of the amenities that were available to us, but there is a great fire place (with firewood provided) in the Den, a hot tub, a fire pit and a Yoga Studio. The 4 bedrooms in the main house all had their private bathrooms. a big plus for our family.
Colin and Fred (our Hosts) were great with communicating and making us feel at home. Highly recommend Leaping Deer Ranch."

Definitely check out The Skillet located a block away for great food. Also a short walk away from the plaza, a walking trail along the Gallinas River, other restaurants, and Highlands University.

Inside the apartment it was no different. I very much enjoyed the space and would come back in a heart beat. Only downside to Las Vegas I found is no ability to rent a car or taxi service coming off the train. Wasn’t able to make it out to the hot springs which was a big reason for coming down.

Apartment had everything's one could need, it was very well thought out too to bottom. 3 heaters/coolers make the rooms comfortable. Kitchen is well Sri led with everything o e could need. All supplies are there and nothing was lacking.
There is currently no wi fi but we were able to connect to xfinity so if u have that it's no issue.
Place is right across from the historic castenada photel which has a lovely restaurant, top class bottle shop and classic barroom.
Area is quiet
Las Vegas is a beautiful town with so many places to see and what at wonderful place to explore it from!
Tina was friendly and met us with the keys and reached out to make sure we were good. Even checked with us before to see our preferences in sheets!
Highly recommend this place and would stay again!"

Perfectly located for what we wanted, 15 mins to Las Vegas, an hour from Santa Fe or Santa Rosa.
Located on the well positioned 84 but remote and rural enough to hear the silence and see the stars.
The cabin was extremely well equipped for all our needs with high quality products and equipment.
On the rare occasion we did need help (we stayed for 2 weeks) Gabrille was immediate in her response to our messages and went above and beyond to resolve any issues.
We can’t recommend Aug’s cabin highly enough for anyone looking to visit Las Vegas but wanting a rural New Mexico experience.
Thank you Gabrielle."

Stayed a few nights","One reason I like Airbnbs better than hotels is because most Airbnbs have way more character - and Vanessa and Jaime's place oozes character. Former saloon turned speakeasy. Much of the original structure is preserved and rally nicely restored, but it has all the modern conveniences too. I especially like that the bedrooms are in the basement, so they're quiet and get really dark. The kitchen is well equipped, laundry was easy. Convenient location just a five minute walk from the Plaza (which had a live band on Friday evenings). Nice to have plenty of off street parking too. Jaime and Vanessa are very friendly hosts as well. Great place."

After we left she saw to it that our private Netflix account was removed from the television because I couldn't figure out how to do it myself. I would not hesitate to recommend Vanessa and the property to anyone I know interested in staying in Las Vegas, New Mexico."

Stayed with kids","Vanessa's house is a beautiful old jem! The upstairs is large and airy. We were traveling with two young kids so the gate on the stairs was particularly helpful and my kids learned how to play foosball on the coffee table that was just their height. The neighbors, Jamie and his wife, were so nice and generous with our kids. They helped our kids find and pet their cats and even wrapped up some seeds to their beautiful sunflowers for us to take home. I would definitely stay here again, there is so much to do in Las Vegas that I didn't know about. We would love to visit again!"

Our family had a wonderful stay!
Our daughter loved the beds being so high off of the ground, the foosball/coffee table and having a television in her own room- though it saw little use.
The almost 300 year old claw foot was a dream relived for me and mi amor.
After miles of driving, exchanging rental cars, dealing with Mercedes’ warranty department- my partner and I step outside momentarily only to realize we left our phones inside and no memory of the code to get in. Our daughter asleep.
We were locked out.
Luckily Wes was able to help us via interstellar communication, I.E an ADT ring system.
We are both grateful for that. Thanks!
Wether Las Vegas is a destination for you and your family or y’all are just passing through, don’t hesitate- book this spot."

The Montezuma hot Springs set by the Gallinas river with a view of the castle are nearby as is the beautiful plaza of Las Vegas with it’s old times Main Street (National St). The shops and restaurants have gotten better that ever without sacrificing any charm, becoming quirkier to reflect the local artists and University population. Las Vegas is often used in TV and movie sets (Roswell and No Country for Old Men). Ski resorts and Santa Fe are roughly an hour away. Kids really enjoyed the home and outdoors and I enjoyed the peaceful atmosphere in the house. I would recommend to anyone wanting an authentic New Mexico experience."

Stayed one night","A friend and I booked a one night stay at the Studio of Kathryn M. The Studio is a very peaceful and welcoming environment. As we entered the studio, we were greeted by beautiful music and a big colorful room with tremendous natural lighting. There is a recliner to use after a long drive.
Kathryn was very kind and welcoming from the very start. She is very responsive in messaging and gave plenty of good instruction about the house, and information about Las Vegas.
She does have a cat, Sparky, and a dog, Flapjack. Both are friendly and quiet, I didn’t interact with them much, as they like to keep to themselves :)
The Studio is very clean, the bathroom was also very clean and the hot water runs excellent in the shower.
The bed had a memory mattress, it was very comfortable, I had a full nights rest on it and I didn’t even wake up once.
It’s a perfect stay for a single person or a couple. The neighborhood is safe and quiet. Our overall experience at this studio was excellent!"

Stayed a few nights","Great stay.
Clean, quiet, and beautiful dark night sky.
There were no surprises.
A few things to make sure you notice.
The house is 5 miles from town so grab groceries while you are in town.
There is a gate you need to go through that is hard to see at night. Someone will need to get out of the car each time and open/close the gate.
The road to the house is rocky/dirt and a little loose on the way up to the house.
There is no wifi at the house so be prepared to use cell data. Cell service signal was fine.
The tv doesn’t have a remote so it is a bit difficult to use. No streaming services.
Finally, if you arrive at night the lights might be not be on when you arrive so have a light ready because it is really dark out at the house."

Stayed with kids","Delightful rustic cabin in the mountains above Las Vegas, NM. The surrounding property is beautiful even though the forest has been touched by the hermit/calf fire. The cabin itself is cozy and surprisingly clean! The kitchen is vintage but equipped enough for most basic meals. The bathroom is a little tight, squish around the toilet, sink and shower should be operated with care. The ceiling is low but for folks around 5’9” it’s just right. The porch hangs over the road and views beaver creek, we saw little fish and our kiddos loved playing in the creek. Spent a good amount of time enjoying the breeze in the mornings and evening. Loved our time and will be fondly remembering our time! Almost would like to keep this place a secret!"

Stayed a few nights","This is out second time at these cabins and the location is unbeatable!
The view of Hermit's Peak is phenomenal from the meadow. Some of the cabins are very rustic, if that's what you are looking for. The Martin cabin had low ceilings which were a little uncomfortable for my husband in the kitchen and the shower, tight spaces but for a short weekend it's enjoyable and the place has everything you need. Very friendly and helpful hosts, would recommend them to anyone. they are fixing up some of the cabins to be more updated and those will be wonderful. Lots of hiking on their land, a beautiful babbling brook and for the most part quiet."

Stayed a few nights","We loved our stay at the Martin cabin! Kat and Lacey were so responsive, friendly and just delightful to interact with in every way, and gave us perfect privacy. It was clear they really wanted us to have a good time and enjoy ourselves in this stunning setting, which for us, was so perfect with the immediate access to and immersion in the Hermit's Peak environment which is so special to our family. And the weather gave us such surprises and laughs with its extremes - snow in May!!!! Then glorious sunny blue skies again! Wow! But we loved every minute of it and how those heaters kept us warm no matter what. We saw the cabins 11 years ago so can personally attest to the wonderful improvements that have been made not only to their comfort level but just their character in general. They are very quirky and rustic but this added to their charm for us. Our bed was super comfortable and perfect for us and I am a very picky sleeper! We also noticed and really appreciated the high quality cotton sheets. The quiet and darkness at night really helped us relax and melt into peacefulness that is really only possible, for me anyway, in such unique, special natural environments as this where your connection to nature is unparalleled. Oh! My husband wanted me to mention the water in the cabin - he loved the taste of it! Very clean and fresh - matching the environment! And the porch was the perfect hang out place overlooking the creek and forest. Thank you, thank you , thank you, Kat and Lacey and helpful Ron! We hope to return soon!!"

However, if you follow the host’s directions exactly, you’ll go through a much smoother road than the alternative. The cabin is very cozy and we instantly felt at home. It had everything we needed for the weekend. It’s fairly secluded and the owners were kind enough to let us explore their huge land since we were guests there. All in all, we had an amazing stay at the Martin cabin."

The property is peaceful and scenic. From the meadow you can see Hermit Peak. The hike up Hermit Peak is fantastic, and the cabins at El Rito are the perfect location if you are planning to go up. If you want to get away and relax, the Martin cabin is a great place to do it. Kat and Lacey are gracious hosts. We appreciated the history of their family and the cabins."

Stayed with kids","Just spend the extra few bucks for a hotel. That’s what we had to do after taking a look around this property. I was traveling with my wife and month old baby to Las Vegas for a funeral. I saw this rental was about the same as a hotel and decided to try it out. We got there late at night, around 11. I notified JoJo and he said that was okay. When we got to the property we realized it was surrounded by abandoned and boarded up houses. I was willing to look past this until I noticed the windows on the first floor do not lock or close all the way. I notified JoJo of my concerns but unfortunately it was already 1AM at this point so I don’t fault him for not responding. We cancelled and moved to a hotel because I wasn’t going to have my family sleep in a muggy, dusty, unsecured house in an unfamiliar, seemingly abandoned neighborhood. The next day I asked JoJo if I could get at least another day refunded as we never even laid a finger on any of the furniture, but he did not reply."

Stayed a few nights","This was the second time we stayed here. The location is great, there’s not a lot of choices in this town. The house is older, we knew that since we stayed before. The downstairs is clean, the upstairs carpet seems old and dusty, and has narrow stairs . We were not aware that the upstairs shower and tub was not working until we got there and no choice but to stay. The downstairs tub/shower is in the master bedroom so that made it very inconvenient for a party of 4. It’s a good house, it’s in a good location, but the house needs to be deep cleaned , especially the carpet on the stairs and upstairs and fixed up a little. With a little TLC this house could be really awesome. Great location to downtown, colleges, hot springs, etc"

Stayed about a week","Would have liked to have known about the construction (it was my uncle that told me and took pictures) could have found the house easier and faster. Barricades seem to be haphazardly put up and taken down all through the day so access was an issue-almost no traffic was a plus. Had no idea where the garbage can was and come to find out by accident, owners dad was in the backyard moving it from behind the house to the street and had gotten hung up on the clothesline with his truck. They were really nice and they explained some things to me we couldn’t find. We never used the upstairs. The heaters didn’t seem to work up there, no shower or bathtub to be used bc of some leak, the staircase is really narrow and steep so careful with the radiator pipes. It’s a house that needs some maintenance and tlc. Easy to get in the house. Expect people to walk through the yard at weird hours and around it. Parking is left side of house but the house can be driven around completely. Felt every bit home."

The house is very well laid out and all furnishings are in good shape and comfortable. The owners have thought of just about everything in terms of what you will need. While we didn’t do any cooking, the kitchen is well laid out and seems to have all the necessities. The beds and linens are comfortable.
Leonard helped us out with directions for visiting a friend in the area. He made sure that we had his cellphone number. He always responded quickly to our texts.
Things to remember about staying in this part of the country: Do your shopping before leaving the main highway. There is a Walmart in Las Vegas as well as other shops and restaurants. There are no services once you leave the main highway. Make sure to use the directions provided by the owners. These are the best."

Len calls this lovely home a casita. It is, in reality, a true home with three full bedrooms and two baths. There are special touches through out that make visiting feel more like home.
Len is very quick to respond to queries about availability and stays in touch throughout.
Some details that you might look forward to:
A kitchen with the cooking tools needed to make real meals. There are some limited supplies like olive oil, salt & pepper, some spices available. However, if there is something that you must cook with, it’s best to bring your own. Eating meals on the front patio is such a treat at any time.
Hiking. There is so much space to explore and it’s never dull.
Peace and quiet. The property sits at the end of a road and there are no homes close by. It is so quiet. The stars are brilliant at night.
Len’s home is fantastic and worth repeated visits."

Len was instantly in communication and remained so during the entire visit. He was willing to accommodate us and shared fully all expectations for staying over at his home. His directions to the property were perfect and we arrived in the amount of time that he said we would. He provided us with a welcome bottle of wine from one of our local NM vineyards - delicious!
The property was just as described and could not have been more perfect for what we were seeking. There were no sounds of traffic as we were located at the end of the road. The only sounds we heard were those of the wind blowing through the many pine trees and birds.
The hiking was fantastic and we never got bored going out for walks with our dogs.
Checking out, we were sad to leave, was very easy. We hope to go back again for some more rest and relaxation soon! Thank you, Len!"

Stayed over a week","The place itself is well cared for and clean. Full kitchen with dishwasher a big plus. Internet worked well for remote work. There are no windows in the bedroom; just the front door at in the front of the kitchen. The location is right in town, which has its benefits and drawbacks. You are right around the corner from the plaza where there are shops and some restaurants. However, there is also some safety precautions to be aware of. Keep the gate locked. I had someone wander in thinking they were at a shelter. Linda and Anne were very responsive and accommodating."

We booked last-minute on our way through the area, but Sandra and Vince both went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed (as well as great tips on where to have dinner and breakfast the next morning). We will definitely stay again if our travels ever bring us back to Las Vegas!"

We did some hiking and enjoyed coffee on the front porch where we watched the beautiful animals from across the road. The smell of the fresh mountain crisp air. Some of the many reasons I love my home state. 💛💚

Stayed a few nights","If you are looking for an authentic and unique mountain cabin experience, this is it! Rustic, clean and comfortable, offering peaceful solitude (with access to assistance if needed) in a gorgeous setting. We loved walking the vast acreage of the property as well exploring the very nearby Pecos Wilderness and surrounding Gallinas Canyon area. We also thoroughly enjoyed reading on the porch!
There’s WI-FI access if you want it.
The Denmin cabin provides a wonderful stay for our group of 4. Curtain dividers create adequate privacy in this charming, single room cabin.
Kay and Lacey were responsive to our questions before we arrived and checked in on us by phone after our arrival to be sure we had what we needed. We will be back!"

Cabin was located in a very scenic and serene location, overlooking a meadow with views of Hermit Peak on one side and nice creek on the other side. Lot of positive energy and vibes at this place. We really had a great time staying here. Our 11 and 4 year old boys didn't wanted to leave! We will be back for sure!"

We loved the special touch such as our welcome note and welcome snacks on the table. Lacey and Kat were the perfect hosts! This cabin is the perfect secluded get away with wonderful views. We gave up Fourth of July fireworks in the Las Vegas town so that we could spend the evening in the cabin. WiFi was a bonus in planning our day excursions. We will definitely be back!"

Stayed a few nights","If you want quiet, solitude, and rustic retro, this cabin is the place for you. Wonderful mornings to wake up to with the sounds of birds in the fresh smelling pines. Take your coffee or tea outside and watch the sun and the clouds play hide-and-seek with Hermit Peak, the background for the sweet smelling grass pasture that extends from the back door of this cabin. With 150 acres of pines, oaks, cottonwoods and grasslands to walk in you have plenty of space to enjoy the wildlife. For the hiker numerous trails are nearby in the National Forests, and for the fishing buffs, the streams are some well kept local jewels. Las Vegas is a neat town to visit, the art community is up and coming and the restaurants serve some famous green hatch chili dishes. Visit the plaza in the historical district with it's famous 1880's hotels and buildings for a walk in yesteryear. Easy day trips to Santa Fe, Pecos , Mora and Taos are scenic drives not to be missed. Whether you enjoy the outdoors or the Old West appeal of the local towns, this cabin is far in the woods but easy enough to get too. Enjoy, I sure did and will again."

Stayed a few nights","Lacey is an amazing host! We arrived to find a pitch-perfect rustic cabin set amongst pine and oak with a beautiful view of the famed Hermits Peak. Kat and Lacey warmed our arrival with a gift basket full of goodies and a refrigerator full of bottled water. I seriously dreaded leaving this beautiful valley and plan to return soon.
The cabin was built by hand in the 1950s, so it has rough edges. For city dwellers and suburbanites, this perfectly appointed period piece cabin is a welcome respite from the squares and boxes and veneer that surround our modern lives. Kudos to Lacey and family for preserving these beautiful, unique Americana treasures."
