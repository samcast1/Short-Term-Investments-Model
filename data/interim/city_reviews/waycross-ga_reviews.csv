Stayed with a pet","Just got back from spending Thanksgiving Day and weekend in Waycross near my sons' hunt camp. The home is very nice with 4 comfortable bedrooms, 3 1/2 bath-rooms, a well appointed kitchen, and plenty of seating space in the living room for a large family to sit around and watch movies together. On arriving Wednesday evening before Thanksgiving, I noticed that there was no can opener in the kitchen. Pushpa was there within minutes bringing a can opener so I could open the cranberry sauce for Thursday's meal. If my son's keep the same lease next year, I would not hesitate to stay again."

Stayed a few nights","Beautiful and quiet made for a great relaxing weekend. Cabin was exactly as I expected based on description. Ashlynn was immediately responsive and helpful due to a light issue that was resolved with the flip of a breaker. Had appliances needed to cook some food. Well stocked and clean. Very easy arrival and departure instructions. Ashlynn gave the best recommendation for restaurant for us to check out.
Little funny for the trip: my husband was trying to fast forward the basketball game using the tv remote. He said “this remote is weird- I’m having to press rewind to make it go forward”. After a quick second of me processing what he said he said “oops, I have it upside down.” We got a good laugh out of it. Thankful to have such a nice place for us to spend a couple of days without the hustle and bustle of the “real world”."

Stayed a few nights","Really enjoyed our stay at the cabin. The well equipped small kitchen let us cook all our meals there, which meant we could eat on the screened porch and enjoy the sunset over the pond, the sounds of the frogs and birds, and the passing train in the distance. Relaxing. This location was perfect for visiting the Okefanokee because we were minutes from the Waycross entrance and only 45 minutes from the Folkston entrance. We appreciated the proactive communication about which entrance to use because of the heavy rains the days before. She was also very helpful and responsive when we asked a question about the cabin while there. We would love to return in the future."

Stayed with a pet","Beautiful cabin and it had everything we needed for my short business trip. The lake is quiet and the fireplace was divine. The patio deck overlooks a beautiful lake. The bed was very comfortable and the shower was warm. It was so close to many restaurants and stores. The only thing we wish we had known was that it was close to a railroad that ran at 3:00am. This was quite loud and startled my dog.
My husband slept through it, I was unable to do so. Again, I am so pleased with the cabin amenities everything was beautifully decorated and no detail was missed. Literally has everything you would need for a short getaway."

Stayed a few nights","This was our 2nd time coming, and we couldn't love this place more! it's the perfect private getaway, especially from a busy place like Sav. The giant barn doors over looking the gorgeous lake, the metal roof that makes rainy days the most relaxing thing ever, and a bed you'll never wanna get out of! Being able to be out there by yourself, the whole lake to yourself, no noise from neighbors or other people! It's the perfect place to go escape and forget the world exists."

Stayed a few nights","We found Jacob's listing when we were looking for a place to stay for our daughter's wedding. It surpassed our expectations. It is a gated home which keeps unwanted visitors away and allows you to have a secluded place of your own, but it is close enough to the local town and attractions that there are things to do as well. The backyard is awesome, I do not think his photos does it justice. We have no complaints, we enjoyed our stay and would certainly book this rental again."

Stayed with a pet","We had such a great time here. We planned a impromptu trip and were able to enjoy the surrounding areas. On day one we took a boat tour at the further location of The Okefenokee swamp about 45 minutes away. It was a great swamp tour and that park had a boardwalk that went into the swamp. The main park is 10 minutes away from the house and also has boat tours and train rides, walkable areas. On day two we took a drive to Jacksonville to visit their zoo and beaches. It was only an hour and a half away. Day three we went to Jekyll Island and visited their beaches and driftwood beach was amazing. There is also a water park on the island. We then cruised over to St. Simons for dinner. Again these locations were only an hourish drive. We visited the local bowling alley and skating rink. Kroger was nearby. Went to Captain Joes for dinner. Overall this location was so beautiful and we really made the most of our trip. The kids loved the A frame and so did we! Thanks for an amazing time!"

Stayed a few nights","VERY ZEN. Jacob’s home is tasteful, comfortable and modern. It’s obvious a lot of thought and consideration has been put into the design and construction (inside and outside). Everything in the home–including the spacious layout, lovely appliances and unexpected extras; such as the touch screen next to the light switch in the bathroom (for fan, night light, music via Bluetooth) have been considered and it makes this home a great place to stay. The outside has comfortable areas to relax; outdoor furniture, bbq and fire pit. It was raining whilst we were there but we plan to take full advantage of all on our next trip. Conveniently located near the Okefenokee Swamp and Laura S. Walker State Park. Several good restaurants can be found in the town; such as Fancy Q (try the sushi lobster roll) and Thai Spice (check out the crab rangoon). Should you have any questions, Jacob is friendly and quick to respond."

Stayed with a pet","We definitely enjoyed our stay here. It looks like the hosts plan to turn this property into an AirBnB community of sorts. The home we stayed in was very nice, comfortable and well decorated. Everything was clean and in excellent working order. Being out in the country was very peaceful. The only two drawbacks were 1) the WiFi was not super fast and would work intermittently so we had to reset the router several times and 2) trains come by every few hours and can get very loud. However, one would come by around bedtime but then we didn’t hear any through the night. Both of these issues may be expected though, in exchange for a home out in the country. Overall, this is a great property and we would stay here again."

The thermostat had a schedule and would not drop below 75. It was 90+ outside the days we were in town! I understand there are high ceilings and it costs a lot to run the air constantly, but my husband and I were unable to get a good nights rest because every time we tried to adjust the temperature, it would go right back up."

Things to be aware of for some guests:

2. For guests with pets, this yard has a fence, but your escape artists can easily find holes so don’t leave them unattended."

Stayed one night","The stay was decent.
The house has lots of potential but currently it’s in need of major upgrades.
We were in town visiting family for a funeral. When we arrived we encountered broken and weak boards on the porch. Once inside, the house was cold.
Above the thermostat on the ceiling and in the showers were obvious large amounts of mold/mildew.
Throughout the house there were large cracks in the ceiling and walls.
While the door knobs were apart of the decor they did not relay a sense of security. No locks on bedroom doors.
The kitchen floor was buckling and warped in areas. There was a hole in the wall in the living room big enough for varments to enter and there were dead bugs in the kitchen window. The owner did replace the thermostat while we were there, but that delayed us 1.5 hours from visiting our relatives.
We were refunded $20, which I felt was insufficient to what we had to endure.

The pots and cooking utensils could use some updating. The check in said light snacks, there were none.
The beds were very comfortable and the rooms were nice. The wifi had trouble extending into the master.
The house would be worth the money with a little money put into fixing up the problem areas and stocking the kitchen with usable pots, pans, and cooking equipment. The location was convenient and centrally located.
I'd try Tabitha's other properties but I'd probably skip this house next time."

The owner was very nice and responsive. I love that the only TV in the house was in the living room which forced the kids to hang out with mom! It was a great TV too. Had this live feature where my son could replay the soccer games he missed during our drive (which was a big deal for him) We had great family time here. There was a lot of personal touches in the house that just made us feel at home. The neighborhood was quiet, and we felt safe here during our stay which was important for a mom traveling from out of town with her kids. Definitely recommend!"

They had a high chair and pack & play set up which was so convenient for us because I completely forget to bring a pack & play. Quiet neighborhood in a cute area. We’ll definitely stay next time we’re back in town seeing Grandpa and Great-Grandmother."

The plus was the delightful deck with hanging lights all around. The house is in a nice neighborhood.

Group trip",Wow! The place was decorated beautifully. My wife said she wants to move in! It was very comfortable and homey. The owner/s seem to have thought of everything they could have for every possible customer. There were little things that made the stay enjoyable. My Mother has dimensia and has problems around strange places. But the feel of the place made it much more like a home than a hotel stay would have. She felt much more at ease there than she would have at a hotel. We were in the area to attend my Father's funeral and staying here felt much better than the stay at a hotel would have. Thank you so much.

Stayed a few nights","Marva's place was perfect! Jill was lovely. I was home for a funeral and wasn't sure exactly where it was in Blackshear. Turned out to be a couple of streets over from the lifelong friends I was visiting. If I could give it an 11, I would. The home was very clean which is my most important need, beds comfortable, kitchen stocked, bathroom clean and precious, great instructions, beautifully decorated and kept. The whole house is wonderful! The yard is great, parking easy, safe neighborhood. Just lovely. I look forward to staying again soon! No more hotels when I travel home. I wish I could keep it a secret ;). Thank you, Marva and Jill for making me feel at home!"

Sitting on the porch and having coffee and a glass of wine in the evening where passerbys wave felt like going back in time. Its 4 minutes from downtown Blackshear but has a country feel. The house is adequately stocked for cooking. Only problem is my wife wants me to build one just like it...so this rental may wind up being more expensive than I thought. On top of that...the cleaning fee is much appreciated...makes you want to super clean it before you leave.

Stayed with a pet",The home was clean and a nice home large enough to accommodate us well Pretty much everything we needed was there. Would have preferred more toilet tissue to be under the cabinets than what was there so that I didn't need to have to call for it which I didn't because I brought some of my own. the furniture in the house was okay and look nice but however two of the beds had really soft mattresses that were not comfortable but for some others may have been comfortable but anyone with back problems or neck problems probably would not be comfortable. There was one bathroom with problems that had a bad shower head that made it unaccessible to get any water on the body and I did report it and my response back was we will replace that shower head. Also when we got there the street trash can was already full and no trash was picked up while we were there for 5 days. Other than these things we were happy with our stay and would recommend this place and consider staying again

Our dog Buddy is getting old and normally doesn't like dealing with other dogs. However, he took up with Tucker and Buddy throughly enjoyed his stay as well. We are familiar with the Waycross area and the neighborhood where the cottage is located is one of the better areas. Very quite, little traffic and very peaceful. We highly recommend Dorothy's cottage and we are seriously considering spending a month or so our next visit. The cottage was very clean, everything was in proper working order and the grounds were immaculate. Very comfortable and relaxing experience."

Stayed a few nights","Always wondered what a perfect ""5 star"" rated AirBnB would be like and now we know. Everything worked, everything was in order, enough room for us , immaculate, etc.
AirBnB should hire Dorothy to consult with other AirBnB hosts to improve their rentals."

The location was perfect and our dog had such a great time playing with Dorothy’s pup Tucker. Dorothy was an amazing host. She gave clear and detailed instructions, made sure we had everything we needed, and checked in on us to make sure our stay was perfect. She even took our pup out to play while we were at the Swamp Park with our boys. I would highly recommend staying at the Little White Cottage if you’re in Waycross!"

I’ve never stayed at a pet friendly air BnB that also offered opportunity for my pup to play with the host dog. What a treat! I will be back!"

The cottage is surrounded by much natural beauty in a very quiet neighborhood....we were treated every morning to beautiful cardinals as we ate breakfast outside the window. The cottage is stocked with anything you could ever need on a trip away from home and if you need something Dorothy is the definition of Southern hospitality and is so helpful. The beds are super comfy Dorothy left thoughtful little touches throughout the cottage that made us feel very welcome. Keep up the amazing job!!!!!

The front porch is perfect. If you are traveling with a baby or kids, your needs will definitely be met here. The crib and high chair were great to have available. There is even a small park right across the street. And Dorothy was a wonderful host! Very attentive and very kind and went above and beyond any host that we’ve ever had.

Dorothy herself was kind and communicative, making the stay that much better. If you find yourself in Waycross or just looking for a place to decompress, I would recommend this place!"

Stayed a few nights","Tabitha and Adam went above and beyond to accommodate us during our stay. We arrived shortly after Hurricane Idalia hit and many people lost power despite our hosts losing power for 48+ hours they still managed to pull together the Airbnb for us right on time. We were pleasantly surprised to find a basketball court and hottub behind the house! We spent lots of time swinging on the front porch, it was lovely. The bedding and bathrooms were very comfy and clean! We will be back to stay again at Tabitha and Adam's little oasis in Waycross. Thank you again for creating the perfect place for our family to gather 😀"

Stayed with a pet","Tabitha & Adam’s home suited our needs perfectly. The home is nicely furnished and the beds were very comfortable. The backyard had a newly installed private fence which made it perfect for my dog, as well as a new hot tub which would be wonderful in the cooler months. The home is close to shopping and restaurants and the quiet neighborhood is nice to take strolls in the evening. Tabitha & Adam were very prompt in getting a serviceman out to remedy an issue we had while staying there. I highly recommend them as hosts. My only hope is they expand to a nearby town! ;)"

The amenities were great, and I felt nothing was lacking. I would highly recommend this stay if you want to feel at home while away from home. Anytime I’m in the area, I would most definitely stay again. Thank you for a perfect stay!"

We found the listing description and list of amenities to be spot on. We especially loved the huge partially enclosed back yard with a large patio. The weather was perfect so we spent many hours out on the patio under the ancient trees. It became our dining room. The house is updated and tastefully decorated throughout. The bathrooms (one full, one half) are completely renovated and look great. Beds are very comfortable. Just the right firmness. Tabitha is very responsive to text and chats but is not in any way intrusive. It’s an excellent value. We enjoyed our stay here and will be returning."

It’s very spacious, much more so than the pictures suggest, very clean, comfortable, and right down the street from the hospital. It’s in a quiet neighborhood, is easy to sleep at any hour with no noise, and has all the amenities you could expect. Really there are no cons. Well worth the reasonable cost, especially in comparison to some other units in the area. If I am again in Waycross in the future this will be my first choice for a place to stay. Can’t recommend enough."
