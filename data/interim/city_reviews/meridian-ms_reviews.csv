Stayed over a week","Great Apartments/Lofts in downtown Meridian – metropolitan loft living at surprisingly budget friendly prices.
Jeff and Sonya are a genuine pleasure to deal with, both make checking in a breeze and are always there should an issue* or question arise. We have stayed at every hotel/motel in town from the Drury INN to the Baymont and Microtel suites across from the mall – Lofts were hands down winner everything considered. Beyond the clear price comparison, each of the furnished lofts includes basic utensils, cookware, household items, wifi, full kitchens w/dishwasher, in unit laundry...and even complimentary supplies of laundry soap, dryer sheets and the like.
We can only speak for ourselves, but have traveled extensively both in the US and abroad and the overall experience would be hard to beat anywhere. Talking strictly within the Meridian area, during our (so far 7mth) house hunting journey we’ve stayed at nearly all available accommodations and are beyond glad to have found our go-to place/people for our future needs!
*Note: The only issue we had turned out to be ‘user error,’ cleared up within minutes of reaching out for clarity. (Husband couldn’t figure out how to use the shower and thought it was broken)"

Stayed over a week","My husband and I stayed at Jeff’s place while moving back across the country. Our stay was longer term than the usual but he graciously worked with us and our ever-changing timeline while we waited to close on our home.
The loft was very spacious and clean with a full kitchen and a W&D in the unit. There was even a little goodie basket to welcome us! These small touches became tremendous comforts that went a long way while living out of our suitcases.
His hospitality and local recommendations made our adjustment to the area so much easier. We were less stressed knowing we had a comfortable place to call “home,” even just temporarily. I would absolutely stay with Jeff again and highly recommend his place to my friends and family."

Comfy bed with nice linens are located in separate area from living area. The living area has tv, desk and daybed for an extra guest. Bathroom has nice clean towels, soaps and hair dryer. Kitchenette has coffee service and small frig and microwave. The neighborhood is older. The neighbor across street greeted us and made us feel at ease. This is 3 min drive to downtown shops. Treat yourself to a delicious meal at Weidmans (the oldest restaurant in Mississippi) it is a few blocks . The food was fabulous!"

Stayed one night","The place was easy to find and very close to downtown where we needed to be. We had trouble with the lock, but a call to Jim helped get that resolved. The space was very nice in our suite, large and accommodating and well furnished including kitchen. The house is older, very large and needs some maintenance. We were the only ones there that night so being in a very large older home felt a little disconcerting. Everything operated fine so that was good but bedsheets were not fresh. Neighborhood on the whole was a bit rundown but proximity to downtown was excellent. A very nice next door neighbor helped us find the key and get us in. Thank you Jim for your help by phone and providing convenient place to stay. The home has old timey charm and no doubt lots of history!"

It's very convenient to downtown Meridian, which is such a bonus with all the great events and activities the city has to offer. It suited us perfectly. Anyone with mobility issues may take note that there is a high step into the tub for bathing or a shower, but the water pressure's fantastic! We so enjoyed the experience, and this spot is a great contender for future trips to the city."

Stayed one night","Beautiful, clean, comfortable home with much character and charm. The expected signs of age here and there are part of the 19th century house's character; and none of them were service-affecting. Our host, Jim, described Halford House accurately and was responsive and personable with regard to our questions. While I was somewhat apprehensive pulling into the neighborhood at night, it turned out to be a very quiet locale. In addition, my son and I had the privilege of meeting several nice townsfolk the morning of our departure: A neighborly neighbor strolling by the house who was something of a local historian; a local business owner a few blocks away who replaced one of my car's window regulators in record time, a kindly elderly customer who stopped by the shop; and one of the friendliest drive-through attendants at a nearby McDonald's. We would have missed all that had we had not stayed where we did. I highly recommend Jim and Halford House."

Stayed one night","Best value in Meridian!! The old house has great charm, and normal wear for a home over 100 years old. The high ceilings, original flooring, fireplace mantles, outside architectural features are amazing if you like historical homes. The neighbor Missy looks after things and met us in the yard when we pulled in. The ""suite"" is phenomenal: kitchen well stocked to cook easy light meals in, the bathroom shower has wonderful pressure (although the antique tub is tall to step in & out of), and the four poster bed slept wonderfully!!! There is only this house, another large house, and a funeral home on the whole block. It is a very quiet neighborhood, although not the most aesthetically pleasing area. My in-laws live outside the city and we WILL stay here as often as possible!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a WONDERFUL Historical house! It does need some fine tuned attention. The location is not ideal. The unit was clean, however, this is a shared space in this house. The locks need updating. Insure you follow the owners instructions regarding the address, not correct if you use the Airbnb link for directions.
The interior needs some attention, window shades are faulty. If you have mobility issues please consider a different option. It has WONDERFUL potential, just not up to what was advertised."

Jim’s neighbors are angles they found us and helped us contact someone to get in the right location and entering the house successfully! Thanks God! I believe because of Jim should be a very very nice person and has a good relationship with his neighbors , they all help each other! Thanks God we finally had a such deep sleep and rest so well at this cozy home! The House is amazing to stay! Very Elegance!"

This house is 3 minutes from downtown Meridian, making it really convenient to get to the restaurants and shops downtown. There is lots of space, a claw foot tub, a small kitchenette, tall ceilings, and a great little daybed in a living room area. We were in town for a wedding and this place was a great alternative to a hotel. Parking was easy too and the directions made getting there and getting checked in a breeze! I might recommend bringing a sound machine because it is an old house and you can hear the dogs barking or whatever is going on outside, but that definitely wouldn’t stop us from staying at this place again."

As a note to others - there is a BEAUTIFUL old ""clawfoot type"" tub in the bathroom. These tubs can be quite dicey to get into and out of under any circumstance - just beware.

Stayed with kids","Jim's historic lodgings reminded me so much of childhood visits to my great-grandmother's home :) The bathroom fixtures, the building materials, even the creaks and smell were similar! I loved the shower in the cast iron tub and i was pleasantly surprised by the volume of hot water available. There were plenty of fluffy soft towels available.
The tiny kitchenette is tucked into a corner and fully stocked with a Keurig, a variety of coffee and tea, plenty of dishes and utensils, a large dormitory fridge and a small microwave. The perfectly sized television it fits neatly in the builtin wooden bookcase and there are many cable channels available for those who choose to watch it. Only these barest of modern necessities have been provided without sacraficing the overall feel for the sake of modern conveniences.
The elegant 4-poster bed dominates the bedroom. I slept well and really enjoyed the extra touch of real feather-down pillows! The extra fleece blanket on the daybed came in handy also. Houses that are over a hundred years old tend to be a bit drafty and damp, and this one is no exception. I expected this and brought my own extra throw blanket.
This stay is definitely an experience; a walk back in time. If you enjoy the ambience of historic homes, if you find old European hotels quaint and charming, you will love your visit to Jim's place. If you prefer all the comforts and feel of a nice, new hotel, this is not the stay you are looking for."

Stayed one night","What a great place to stay. Hardwood floors, high ceilings, great A/C (important in Mississippi), and too many architectural highlights to list. Jim is a good host. There's a Keurig coffee machine in the kitchen, and a small fridge. The bed is a four poster, and very, very comfortable. Coffee on the front porch sitting in rocking chairs is a plus. This is a nice, quiet neighborhood, and a great place to stay. I'd place this house in the top three of all AirBnBs where we've stayed, based on the home, the history, and the convenience to downtown."

There is a basement area with a pullout couch, TV, and even room to put a blowup mattress on the floor. That was our teenagers hang out. There’s also a washer and dryer downstairs. On the middle level…you have your dining area with a big table which is surrounded by windows and a really cool place to hang out You also have your kitchen with a breakfast nook, two bedrooms with queen beds, a bathroom, and living room. Off the living room you have the front porch with patio furniture, which is where we drink our coffee in the morning and wine at night. The very top floor you have the master suite with a king bed and full bathroom and a huge closet. The location is great. You’re close to the north Hills area but also close to downtown. The neighborhood is nice and quiet."

Stayed a few nights","Our family had a wonderful and relaxing time staying at Boocoodles. Fleeta was a terrific host and we would love to stay at Boocoodles again.
We felt right at home in the house. All of us (the 80-somethings, the 50-somethings, the 20-something) loved sitting on the covered porch outside the living room, watching the cows or reading a book, and taking in the sun or showers, and later the moonlight and stars.
We also enjoyed walking around on the farm, with Fleeta and Larry and also on our own.
A warm-from-the-oven cream cheese pound cake greeted us at arrival, and the kitchen was stocked with snacks and essentials. One day Fleeta and Larry brought over a delicious breakfast of Denver omelette and bacon. The beds were comfortable and the bathrooms were well-stocked with fresh towels and bath products. Fleeta has thought of everything.
We had a wonderful time. Thank you, Fleeta!"

This home is on a lovely piece of property not too far out of Meridian and close enough to everything in the area. This working farm has beautiful woods, hummingbird and bluebirds as well as cows to greet you in the morning and great outdoor spaces to enjoy a little taste of country living.
Inside is a cozy and very clean home with comfy beds, a fireplace and a fun old fashioned kitchen with modern appliances. It’s quiet at night and our stay was refreshing and relaxing. As there is no television or internet currently, it is a real opportunity to disconnect and enjoy each other’s company. We will be back!"

We were there for a wedding and 3 ladies trying to do hair and makeup was difficult. The only thing I had an issue with was there was no outlet in the bathroom. Hard to curl or blow your hair. We had to use a small mirror to do our hair in the dining table which the lightbulb in the dining area was out and hard to see.

A wonderful fit! Had everything we needed for our stay. Bradley was super helpful and exceeded all expectations. The area is great and we visit often. This is by far the best place we’ve stayed in many years. Area is beautiful, in addition to being easy to locate. There are many restaurants and stores nearby for shopping. There are many things to see and visit nearby as well. Nice areas to drive and see the old architecture, and businesses. Variety of shopping! Great culture in Meridian. Lots of history. Bradley is most definitely a Super Host ! Most definitely will visit again soon!"

Stayed a few nights","Great location and felt very safe (2 ladies) Close to everything we wanted to do and restaurants nearby. Actually met Brad and he was very nice and helpful and wanted to make sure we were happy with everything. Apt is across from a hospital/medical center so there was a bit of activity with deliveries and things (noise) so be aware of that if in the balcony side bedroom but nothing that a sound machine couldn't fix. If back in Meridian we would definitely stay here again. Thanks, Brad."

We didn’t have to purchase anything unless we ordered takeout. The apartment is extremely cozy and clean with a fully stocked kitchen, bathroom and bedrooms. So beautifully decorated as well. The location was very convenient for me because I was working at the hospital right up the hill. It was quiet and safe. I did not have to worry about our safety at all. Bradley was very accommodating. He really went out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed. I appreciated his kindness very much. I will definitely be staying here again if it’s available. I highly recommend staying here."

Bradley greeted us upon arrival, gave us a tour of the unit. There were snacks, treats and a full kitchen of everything you need, just like home. He even provided coins for the laundry room downstairs. The area is so quiet and literally minutes from downtown Meridian with shops, eateries and entertainment. It was a short distance from restaurants, shopping and go ol' WalMart. This was the perfect location for a short term or long term stay. It was surely a pleasant visit with the most hospitable host. He should become a SUPER HOST real soon. It was a super visit overall."

The extra details and use of repurposed materials make the cabin something special! The cabin is also well stocked! I can’t think of a single thing that was not available for use!
My kids loved the spacious back porch to play games but the absolute favorite was the walking trails in the woods behind the cabin! If you love nature and the great outdoors this place is one you must try out!!"

Stayed with kids","We really enjoyed staying at Lenices little cabin in the woods. Private, secure and great place to sleep well with our kiddos. We were looking for a place that we didn’t have to unpack the entire truck, it be safe and get a good nights rest after being on the road for 12 hours. We live in the country and sleep much better in that type of environment and lenices cabin gave us this exact peace of mind.
We loved that we were able to park on the back behind the house. The house was unique, rustic and beautifully restored. I loved the uniqueness of the antique lighting, the antique doors and beautiful long leaf pine floors. This accommodation was clean, well kept and fully furnished with what we needed and had great and comfortable beds and pillows.
Highly recommend this little hidden gim. Well worth the drive out town to get a great night sleep."

Group trip","Five lady friends “of a certain age” gathered together on an extremely cold 3-day (4-night) getaway in January in this vintage cabin to play cards/games, eat, drink, and laugh. Our hostess Lenice was very easy to communicate with. She came to check on us the final day and we had a great visit with her, too.
We had most everything we needed . . . lots of towels, facecloths, kitchen hand towels, extra bed linens, etc. The kitchen is fully outfitted with all sorts of pots, pans, glassware, dishes and bowls, etc. There is also a 12-cup Mr.-Coffee-type coffee maker and paper filters.
This cute country house is on a quiet rural road across from the cow pasture and fishing ponds. It was waaaay too cold this weekend to sit on the front porch, but in warmer weather, it would be wonderful to enjoy morning coffee in the rocking chairs. The house is just as pictured in the photos."

We have only spent a night here 2x but would definitely stay again. Lenice and David are great hosts."

Hands down the Sweet Olive Cabin in Morton, MS., was the better option. I love that it has a ramp which is wheelchair accessible. Inside is very spacious and the bathroom has safety features and an easy to access walk in shower We had a very pleasant stay. Lenice and David are amazing hosts. Not only did the cabin exceed or expectations it was even more affordable than a standard room at the nearby Holiday Inn. We definitely plan to be repeat customers."

Stayed about a week","Sweet Olive Cabin is a diamond in the rough. As soon as we walked in my wife and i were in love. It is in the country where we love to be. I was there fishing a Bassmaster Open and it was just about the perfect distance from Ross Barnett Reservoir. There are plenty of things to drive to for supplies, but other than the fishing, we made one trip to the store and stayed at the cabin because of the comfortable setting. They have put a lot of time into the place and my wife and I will definitely be back to stay in the future. Mrs. Lenice answered every question i had immediately. When you are away from home and do not know anything about the area that is priceless. Her and her husband came and checked on us during our stay and they were just like us. Down home country living folks who just enjoy life. I highly recommend staying with them."

The property is beautiful, quiet, and safe. The owner is extremely friendly and helpful, but leaves the amount of interaction up to you. Always readily available if needed. We look forward to seeing you again. Thank you for your help during the anticipated bad weather."

Stayed with kids","Sweet Olive Cabin had everything we needed and more for a quick, small family getaway for the five of us in the country. The kitchen is open and spacious to cook in for this size of a cabin and the decor is unique in that it is modern industrial blended with rustic wood cabin. Lots of neat design touches and very cozy and comfy spaces. The shower and bathroom sink are functional and fun. Every part of the cabin was organized and sparkling clean. The outdoor spaces are open and relaxing. We enjoyed hanging out on the back porch and listening to the waterfall. My family also loved the hammock near the patio for relaxing. This cabin is really amazing and a great value—I highly recommend it and hope to come back soon!"

Stayed with kids","This is a great place to disconnect from city life. The kids loved the rustic style: the faucet decorated like the olden-days pump (but runs water like any normal faucet), and the watering can-designed shower head. The only difficulty was getting decent hot water ... although the owners explained how to get hot water, it was a bit tricky to set up after a long day of traveling. Most of us just skipped the luke-warm water and passed out. The beds were comfy enough and the hosts provided plenty of blankets."

There were actual plates, saucers and coffee cups with a coffee pot provided with coffee. Also available were plasticware and a fan. We love using a fan to help us sleep, even though we brought our own box fan, an additional fan was great to have. It was so Clean, cute, smelled nice and felt so homey out in the country. Jairo quickly responded with any questions I had before and during my stay. Everything was Just perfect! I hope I get the opportunity to stay here again.🤗"

Stayed one night","Listed in the amenities were blender, refrigerator, mini fridge (listed separately) and microwave. Okay, so there isn’t explicitly a kitchen listed however where would a guest be expected to run a blender with no kitchen? (Blender was NOT there) if you’re just needing a hotel like stay with bad internet service then yes this is the place for you! I have dietary issues and so have to cook a great deal of my meals and was not happy about one VERY important picture “conveniently” being left out… and that was the one listed below. There is no kitchen and you better take every single thing you need. There was no iron as listed, the host did provide one after request. There was not even a plastic spoon to stir the coffee however there as great coffee creamers! The internet was horrendous, I couldn’t do any work and a bed pillow case was soiled. It was gated, it was a comfortable and clean (except pictured) and it does have hot water. It is extremely small. One room with a bathroom but cute."

Stayed a few nights","Very comfortable tiny home inside the large gated yard of the host home. The exhaust fan in the bathroom was great! We visited for 5 nights for local work and the hosts respected our space and made sure we had what we needed! Wifi wasn't strong enough to work on our laptop from home, but worked well enough to stream the Roku with no issue. Verizon didn't seem to have good service in this area. We would definitely stay here again if working in the area!"

No TV or wifi, but we were just looking for a bed and bath to rest, so it was a nice place for our trip. The room gave convenient privacy and quiet for less than a motel room would have cost."

I was in town for a trail race in which she volunteering for and I appreciated the info. She also gave local recommendations. The room was well furnished. I appreciated the local literature.

Evelyn's home also stands out because of the fitness room available to work out the tension of a long day's drive. She was there to meet us when we arrived and chatted while I ate dinner. The bathroom also directly adjoins the bedroom, so it's easier to find in the middle of the night than in many homes. I'd encourage folks to stay there."

The house is situated in a quiet and beautifull neighbourhood. We liked having a little stroll around the area and marvel over the houses which are nothing like our Dutch houses.
Back in the house we made a salad in the fully utilized kitchen and went to sleep in the best bed we had up till then. Those sheets! So soft!! They made us sleep longer than planned.

Stayed one night",Evelyn’s space was perfect for passing through. It was easier and felt more comfortable than staying alone in a hotel. She is friendly and makes you feel right at home. Her animals are super friendly but I loved her cat the most. The home gym was an added bonus and the complimentary beverages were a nice touch. I would have enjoyed a longer stay.

My car was full of stuff and I wasn't worried about it being broken into. The bed was comfortable and Evelyn allowed me to use the exercise room to do yoga. Really, it had everything I needed plus some good animal companionship. Thanks Evelyn, if if I travel through Meridian again, I'll definitely try to book with you."

The bedroom is nicely decorated and has a private nice sized bathroom. She has 3 friendly dogs and 2 cats. They were no bother at all just wanted to say hello when you got in. Her home is located in a quiet family neighborhood so it’s nice to walk around after a long drive or dinner.

Stayed over a week","Evelyn's was the first AirBnb that I ever stayed in. I didn't know what to expect and was nervous, but she quickly made me feel at home. I was there for a travel nurse contract so I was there for about 2.5 months. The house is a split plan so you basically had a side to yourself. The room was large and had a bathroom attached. The bed was comfortable and she even had blackout shades on the windows.
You must love animals to stay here. She has 3 dogs that are well behaved and will welcome you home. Luna even escorts you to your room :). I never had an issue with them barking. The only time they bark is when you come home.
I will stay here again if I ever do another nursing contract in Meridian!"

Stayed one night","Just when I think it can’t get better, I meet another host who supersedes my expectations. Evelyn and her pets, three dogs and two cats, were just the best. It’s a quiet neighborhood. The accommodations are clean, and amenities include coffee (Kuerig), microwave, and a mini-refrigerator in the room. Evelyn and the pets will interact with you as much or as little as you wish. I stayed with her both coming and going to Dallas to pick up a dog, and she made my stay so pleasant both ways. My dog got to meet hers, and they were just wonderful. I think it really helped take the edge off of Captain ( my dog) once they met in the back yard."

They made staying there extremely easy and comfortable. I loved how the bedroom connected to the bathroom so you didn’t have to leave the room if you didn’t want to. They had a lot of cute southern decorations and added there own personal touch to their gorgeous home. I loved how they put up magnets from each state on there wall. The location was in a very safe neighborhood. She was very responsive and her husband went out of the way to ship me back some items I have left there. Overall the Airbnb was very clean and very nice to stay at and I would recommend my friends and family to stay here if they were ever in the neighborhood.

We didn’t arrive until probably 2a in the morning after the game, but had no problem finding their home & she was even thoughtful enough to leave the door unlocked so we didn’t have to fool with the lock.

The bed is incredibly comfortable. The bathroom is spacious and has great hot water and water pressure.
Everything is all in one room but the way it’s laid out, it’s so roomy and efficient. You can easily cook if you’d like - everything you need is provided. Just being your groceries.
The neighborhood is beautiful. Lots of high end homes. Felt safe to walk if you’re inclined to do so.
Kris was friendly and answered any questions promptly and with kindness.
This studio is by their home however we felt complete privacy. They do an excellent job of hosting.
Whenever we are back in the area, this will be our go to place to stay."

Group trip","Avoid this place if you don't want to be intoxicated by extremely strong glade plug in fumes. We asked them prior to our arrival if they would remove any if they used them, due to them exacerbating our asthma, which they claim they did, but the smell was so intoxicating we had to leave the second we arrived due to it making us sick and hard to breathe due to the strong odor. And for a one room place, it is extremely overpriced. Luckily Airbnb was able to refund us but it was a headache literally having to deal with that coming in late from a long trip."

Stayed with kids","First of all, the hosts here are above and beyond kind and helpful. When previous guests trashed this property and refused to leave on time, they quickly punted and offered us The Lodge instead. In terms of the lodge, it is at the end of the road near a beautiful small lake. The air conditioning worked quickly, and the place was cool by the time we went to sleep. Full disclosure, the lodge is not really designed as a family home. There are no TVs, no real sitting areas to speak of, no window coverings in the bedrooms. The two bedrooms operate on the same light switch. The bathrooms and showers are community stall style. The kitchen is very nice and easy to use. People can keep sleeping while you cook because it’s kind of insulated. Good storage room, too! It probably says all of this in the lodge description, but I just wanted to be thorough. It’s a great stop as part of a church camp activity. Beautiful surroundings!"

John was super fast at getting back to us with any issue and I wouldn't hesitate to stay again!!!"

The kitchen was fully stocked with everything we needed to stay off the road and enjoy our peaceful surroundings! The lake/beach area is very well kept and inviting! We will stay again when we get the chace!"

Stayed one night","First off the host Family was down with a stomach bug and could not clean the cabin and said they hired a new company to clean. Also please note we were refunded 100% and John was very apologetic and nice. BUT with that being said, I absolutely hate to write anything negative but I need to be truthful. Unfortunately the cabin was filthy, extremely dusty, trash in cans, food on kitchen table and chairs, tiny braces rubberbands on the kitchen table, dried pee on the toilet, the shower was almost black it was so dirty, no sheets or lines of any type provided( it does state that in the listing and was my error of overlooking), but mattresses were all ripped and stained..we ended up leaving and getting a Hotel up the street. The land the cabin was on was beautiful and again John was very gracious and refunded our $ 100% . Again I hate to say anything negative ever, but I felt it necessary to be Honest."

Full disclosure: we arrived in the dark and left the next morning in the dark, so I can’t really say I could see much. But it was clean, spacious, the coffee pot worked well, had very hot water and is very reasonably priced."

The AC worked great, the shower was powerful and hot, the beds and sofas were comfortable, and the property was beautiful. We fished in the little lake which was a few yards from the cabin and quickly caught a fish. The Shack is very close to NAS Meridian and downtown Meridian. We loved our stay and we will be back."

Our small children were in heaven! They immediately started talking about ""the next time we come here"" and they haven't stopped. This was the perfect place our family needed to get away for a little R&R and unplug!!
John and Hillary were so nice and responsive. They took great care of us! We will be back!!"

The beds were comfortable and the bathrooms were spacious, bright, and clean. There was plenty of closet space. Each bedroom has its own lock. The location was easily accessible to amenities and was located in a quiet neighborhood. The HVAC system nicely heated and cooled the home and the shower water pressure was good. I enjoyed my visit and would stay here again."
