The finished basement with pool table and air hockey was great for stay at home entertainment. We came to Pueblo to share Thanksgiving Dinner with relatives, and this home was the perfect environment for the occasion."

Stayed a few nights","Maria and Steve were amazing. The place was perfect. a few hiccups with the heat yhe first night. They had just installed a new furnace. I woke up the 5 space heaters while the tech worked on it. the space heaters were perfect. It made me a big hit amongst my freemason brothers and even the Grand Master stooped by for some pool. They have 2 other units nearby, and if they will have us, we will rent them all when we are back in August. It's worth every penny."

Group trip","After traveling 18+ hours from Kentucky and Michigan to get here for my uncle’s 85th surprise birthday party, it was a relief to get to Maria’s property. The house was very spacious and clean! Maria called after we arrived to make sure we were okay and again upon our exit to see how our stay was and wish us safe travels. There were plenty of the essentials (ie…rags, towels, linen, cooking utensils, tv’s in every room, etc). The listing does nothing for the property as there is so much more! The location was great (less than 10 minutes from the mall, grocery store, gas station, and plenty of food places). There was plenty of space for everyone to have their own privacy and also to gather when necessary. I would definitely stay here again the next time I travel to Colorado. Thanks again Maria for making our trip go so smooth!"

The first and only thing Hannah had to say to us was that she is allergic to the smell of smoke and make my wife take her only jacket off and seal it in a plastic trash bag. My wife barely smokes and did NOT smoke indoors. She was very rude and unwelcoming. Very rude as her indoor dog jumped all over my wife and Hannah did nothing but continue to lecture my wife about smoking."

Having a living room, dining nook, kitchen, bathroom and bedroom was great, and even though we didn’t use them, a washing machine and dryer were available as well!
Michael included a lot of added amenities, like good tea and coffee and creamers, bread, butter and a whole dozen eggs! for breakfast, as well as ramen noodles, and cliff bars for lunch. The kitchen had everything we needed, including oil and vinegar and assorted spices. The bathroom was well stocked, and the shower was very good. One added touch that we really appreciated, was that every switch was labeled. A great idea! All around, we enjoyed our two nights at Michael’s place, and would highly recommend it."

Stayed a few nights","We were relocating back to Pueblo and we needed a place to stay for several days until the place we were moving into was available. Michael's place was fantastic. Conveniently located close to downtown, but in a residential neighborhood. On street parking was available right in front of the place every time we returned from our many errands. It was exceptionally well-equipt and had just about anything you could possibly need. For example, it not only had a washer and dryer in a small basement area -- it even had a nice sized table you could fold your clothes on. It was nicely decorated and it even had labels on the various light switches to tell you what turned on what. I highly recommend as great bargain and better than places we have stayed at for twice the price or more."

The kitchen was very functional. My wife would like me to note that the only thing missing in the bathroom was an outlet, but the hair curler was happy enough in the nearby kitchen. :)
It was VERY quiet overnight, and the blackout curtains in the bedroom were fantastic. We were running behind after a long day adventuring with friends in the foothills so we really didn't find time/have energy for dinner. Michael's little stash of ramen noodles paired with an egg and a slice of toast made for a just right snack before retiring for the day."

The house itself was spacious, clean, and had all the amenities we needed for a comfortable stay. The location was great - it was close to all the attractions we wanted to visit and there were plenty of restaurants and shops in the area.
But what really made this Airbnb stand out was the host. They were incredibly friendly and welcoming, and went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. They provided us with helpful recommendations for things to do and see in the area, and were always available to answer any questions we had.
Overall, I would give this Airbnb house a solid 5 stars. It was the perfect home away from home, and I would definitely stay here again in the future"

The neighborhood was quiet and the house was very clean and well maintained. Michael has taken every step to make sure you feel at home when you are here. The kitchen is set up and ready to go and we enjoyed making breakfast and dinner during our stay. From the coffee set up to the restroom all ready with soap and shampoo, everything you may need or forgotten at home is here for you. The shower has great pressure and the bed had the perfect firmness to keep me asleep all night. I even had to call and he responded immediately, courteously, and solved my self caused tv issue like the patient professional he is. I can't wait to come back and stay soon... I only wish I had brought him a gift to show how pleased we were with our stay. Next time!"

Everything was clean, the kitchen was well stocked with seasonings, oils, etc. The bed was comfortable, plenty of drawer space as well as a closet and hangers. The towels in the bath were so very soft! This is definitely a great property for anyone to rent, overnight or several days - you won't be disappointed!"

Very easy check in and check out, and Michael was kind enough to stock the kitchen with eggs, bread, and snacks, which made my mornings easy. Highly recommended. One note - if you need complete darkness when you sleep (I don't), bring a sleeping mask. There is a bright light in the neighboring property that shines into the bedroom. I was able to sleep just fine but others may not."

Stayed a few nights","I should state up-front that Michael and I have known each other for several years. As my realtor, Michael recently concluded the sale of my property, a process that I could not have done without his professional dedication, wisdom and expertise. While I only spent two days in his AirBnB unit, it is evident that he brings these same characteristics to the construction and maintenance of his roomy and cleverly designed duplex apartment. In doing so, Michael has anticipated every need of his tenants, from the super comfortable bed, to a kitchen containing everything one might possibly use for cooking including lots of pots and pans, utensils, and an array of herbs and spices. The many food gifts were a very welcome touch as well. Moreover, the whole place is kept immaculately clean. Seis estrellas por 'La Casa de Contentamiento'!"

This home is modest on the outside but inside it has been completely refurbished. Comfortable couch, easy to navigate tv remotes and movie channels. Bath is brand new and sparkling!
Michael provided us with a dozen eggs, a loaf of wheat bread and butter. Had two breakfasts that probably saved us $60.
Plenty of coffee too.
We left thinking that this Bnb was the best choice in Pueblo.
Lastly, Michael is a great host and communicator. We had to change dates and he made sure we could make the change without a hitch.
Thank you Michael, look forward to our next visit. Pat"

We were able to meet Walmart grocery delivery, which you will need for everything food including coffee filters and coffee or you can go yourself as it is just a mile away. I was able to easily cook and fill the kids freezer but we also had great Mexican delivery on the first night.
Just a few minutes and you are in downtown Pueblo or at beautiful Lake Pueblo and about 45 minutes to the Royal Gorge Bridge and beautiful Colorado Springs.

Ex: there's a coffee maker but no coffee in the house. Would have been nice to have access to a usable yard but it's a very affordable price point so I think the savings overrule some more premium touches.

Super convenient entry as she has the code to the door set specifically for you. Definitely will need to stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","Loved our stay here! The house is very clean and cute and just like the pictures inside. There were lots of little touches around the house that made it seem very well managed and made the stay more enjoyable. Each room even has a fan, suitcase stand, and humidifier in the closet. Kitchen was fully stocked with everything we needed including coffee maker and grounds.
One thing to note is the front of the house is right on a busy street. The location is a few blocks away from downtown and felt a little run down. However, there is a great driveway next to the house that fits 2 cars, where you can also privately enter the back gate and enter the house from the back door. This felt very safe and was great for unloading! The backyard is also super private with tall fences and has a patio set and a grill.
The hosts were also very responsive throughout and made it a great experience!"

Location is easy and convenient. Though, this time much more than last, we noticed the many emergency vehicles passing by on their way to the nearby hospital in the middle of the night. Wonderful coffee shop, Black Box, 600 feet walking from the house - highly recommend. Hosts are wonderful! Always very responsive, friendly and helpful. I feel ‘at home’ when we stay.

Stayed a few nights","We loved the Cozy Casa! It was perfect for our visit to family in Pueblo. Walking distance to cafes and downtown, but also an easy few minutes drive to the heart of downtown if you don't feel like walking.
The house is a cute older house, but has been renovated with modern conveniences, and was spotlessly clean. The kitchen had everything we needed, and there is a fenced backyard with grill (a bit too chilly when we were there, but maybe next time). There is some street noise, but we didn't find it was an issue. Loved the basket of little toys and books when our grandson came over for a visit.
Host Heather was great, and sent us all the info we needed. We'll definitely be back!"

Note that the street can be noisy but the bedrooms are at the back of the house so it wasn't an issue for sleeping.

Stayed a few nights","Inside of the house had a very cool ambiance. The cactus 🌵 theme was prominent. Host is a great communicator and plenty of information made available about the sites of Pueblo.
Unfortunately, house was on a very busy street. We woke up to emergency vehicles during the night and the traffic first thing in the morning. The windows let in a great amount of light but easy for passersby to see inside. So, blinds mainly kept closed.
Most of the house seemed clean except for bathroom and kitchen stove. I could barely see my reflection in the mirror due to the build up of toothpaste remnants. The toilet bowl needed a cleaning… won’t say more! And towels were left behind the bathroom door. Supplies were available to clean with after the last tenant. But I was left with that “yucky” feeling of not knowing if the sheets were changed… I let Heather know and she was apologetic and explained it was the hired help. It was an okay stay."

Stayed a few nights","This stay was stunning. Ellyn was so lovely and accommodating. The fireplace is something we don’t have in Texas, so that was a wonderful addition. We did have a couple of issues with cleanliness and temperature, but they were minor and cleaning supplies are kept under the sink, so we just took care of it. There was also an old Alabama record with a confederate flag that was questionable, and the “library” is 95% biblical literature. There were also quite a few religious quotes and paraphernalia that I wish I would have been aware of prior to choosing this stay. It would benefit any host to stay politically and theologically neutral and ambiguous as to not make guests uncomfortable. The robes kept in the bedroom are so soft and perfect for throwing over a swimsuit to get the hot tub ready. There is no smoking marijuana allowed on property, so we had to leave anytime we wanted to indulge, and the driveway wasn’t the easiest to get in and out of. A nice experience, but some issues."

Stayed one night","The views from the hot tub make up absolutely any other possible criticisms. They hot tub is one of the hottest, most private given the shared setup, and most accessible I've had on Airbnb (often they're set low or in a windy spot or there's certain times you can use it, etc) and the views from the tub are simply incredible -- I cannot recommend enough a soak in the sunrise if you find the bed too hard for your liking, or even if you don't. This is a very private mother-in-law basement, although you can hear above a little. They offered a fan and a space heater in the bed room and the rest of the place was well-equipped as well. I really enjoyed our stay here and would recommend it to others."

The host was proactive about letting us know about a hail caused delay and apologized for not having pull out sofa fixed up. sofa was comfortable enough without the pull out part (which we couldn't open ourselves) but wished we'd had it available. couches were soft and TV was huge! do note the shower stall is small enough that you can't bend down to get to feet without opening the door if you are tall lol! kitchen stuff as described.

In particular, the kitchenette and washer and dryer were very convenient after a few weeks on the road for us. We also LOVED the hot tub - can't even begin to describe how great that felt after weeks on the road to just relax and let everything melt away in the water. The neighborhood was also very quiet, new, and safe. Ellyn was very responsive in answering the few questions we had while we stayed.
We'd happily stay here again if we're ever back in the area and would highly recommend anyone staying in the area to do the same!"

Stayed a few nights","You'll thank yourself for booking this, so if it's available, book it! Private and secluded enough to be quiet it's still just a short trip to anything you need in Pueblo West or Pueblo. The Lake Pueblo State park is around the corner and the Royal Gorge is a short ride down the road, as well. Not that you'll want to leave much. The suite is beautiful and large, yet cozy and comfy. With thoughtful and tasteful décor in a functional and large space, you'll feel like you're at your own mountain cabin. A microwave, toaster oven, fridge/freezer, and full complement of dinnerware are some of the little details that make it easy to just stay in and relax, if that's what you want. Luckily, the hot tub is right outside your private entrance. That makes it an easy trip from the private, outdoor tub to one of the two leather sofas inside in front of the large screen LED TV. If you do want to explore, you can easily get to Co Springs, Trinidad, the Royal Gorge, or Canon City. If you want a longer day-trip, check out the Great Sand Dunes or the South Park Brewery. We absolutely loved our stay and we'll be back."

She provided everything that we needed to make our one night stay in Pueblo perfect. Chief among them, an immaculately maintained hot tub that we needed to recover after a long weekend of high-altitude training in nearby Great Sand Dunes National Park.
Her and her husband's comfortable and budget-friendly private suite in their quiet neighborhood was the perfect base camp for this group of outdoor enthusiasts re-acclimating to life ""on-the-grid"""

There was a minor issue with the Roku but it was fixed within a few minutes with her help so don’t worry if you just feel like a couch potato at the end of the day!
She had some useful activity suggestions for the area and since her place is close to the Pueblo Reservoir, I recommend enjoying at least catching a great sunset view from Liberty Point Memorial."

Stayed one night","My husband and I were in town to see the Royal Gorge and this was the perfect location right outside of Canon City. The space was large and accurate to the listing and photos, the kitchenette and coffee/snacks provided was a nice special touch that we really enjoyed. The hot tub is right outside the front door which may have been my favorite part! We didn't venture out much for food as the city had shut down due to COVID-19, but if you have the chance try Donut Oven -- awesome breakfast and super sweet staff. Note that this stay is in the lower level of a house (as we knew) so you are able to hear things upstairs such as TV, water, and people walking. I'm a light sleeper so it may not be an issue for others. Overall, great place and Ellyn was very accommodating and quick to respond with any questions we had throughout our stay."

Relaxing in the hot tub with a view of the mountains during the day and millions of bright stars at night was a great bonus! Ellyn was easy to communicate with and promptly responded to the couple of questions we had. She graciously allowed us to leave our canoe on the property so we didn’t have to tow it around town. The snacks and coffee selection were also a nice touch. Our one regret is that we couldn’t stay longer!

Stayed a few nights","We were in town for my brothers funeral and needed a place close to family. The location was great for us and the use of two ovens was what really sold us. Especially since I was in charge of preparations for the reception following my brother’s memorial service. The pics don’t do it justice, it’s so much cuter in person. With a patio out back and a cute porch up front we loved enjoying the weather in the morning and evenings. Even met a friendly neighbor. The house is older as is everything in Pueblo but it was well maintained and very quaint. Only had to contact the host for check in instructions but otherwise we were good to go. Location is close to the freeway access which was convenient since we had to be everywhere. Every place including hotels have little things that you dislike but this stay was nothing too major. We would definitely stay again and are grateful to have found this place when we needed it."

We found ourselves in a family emergency and Steve went above and beyond to make sure our family was comfortable and had a place to stay. When it came to extending as needed he was extremely flexible and super responsive (immediate call/text)
The house is lovely, very comforting and feels like home. Not only was it clean, it smelled good, it also has EVERYTHING you might need in your home away from home. From Kitchen Utensils, to board games and everything in between. The house is centrally located with easy access to the highway (I-25) It is in a quite neighborhood, within a 5 min drive from Supermarkets/Restaurants and a min from the nearest hospital. It's also walkable to the nearby lake Minnequa, which offers a nice 2,5mile loop for a nice walk/run.
Stay Here!

We had trouble opening the lock box our first night and couldn't get in. She answered right away and came to save the day! We were so grateful. Everything in the rental was clean and up-to-date. The bed is also very nice! She even had complimentary coffee, tea, and beers in the fridge. The coffee was definitely a wonderful delight, especially since I have work very early in the morning. I would certainly recommend this place to anyone!"

I highly recommend staying here!"

Stayed a few nights","Cecily was a great host always responded within minutes of my messages. Super cute little pad definitely has a quirky, funky, vintage vibe, which I love.
I could FEEL the history in that building…. once upon a time, long ago a handsome, hard-working steel worker and he’s cute young bride probably lived there. I could picture her with her hair curled in a polka dot apron, making a simple dinner for him when he came home from working at the steel mill. 🥰 very charming little spot & Cecily did a great job, decorating it in a way that keeps that cool retro vintage feel.
Lots of great sunlight, felt private even though it’s right in town.. having coffee on the back deck was lovely. If I come to Pueblo again, I will definitely book here!"

Only say that because, like many parts of Pueblo there are some unsavory people wandering around. But other than that it was a relatively short walk to the Riverwalk. There are a few small stores, shops, and eateries nearby.
Cecily was a great host. Very responsive and friendly. Thank you.

We used this as a resting place between Denver and the Sand Dunes.
We had challenges sleeping as the neighbors are separated by a door right next to the bedroom and the sounds from them and from the AC unit kept us up all night.

I would certainly recommend this airbnb to anyone wanting a hassle free, all-round pleasant experience. I'd argue this home is better than a hotel!"

He supplied laundry detergent which was great! The space is very tastefully decorated, and the house was very tidy & clutter free. The AC unit worked well. Staying in Pueblo during a Colorado trip gave us pretty easy access to Canon City (Royal Gorge Park), Great Sand Dunes National Park (2 hour drive), and Denver. Check-in was super easy."

Stayed a few nights","Great place to explore Pueblo from. Very historic neighborhood and nice historic home. The only thing I would point out is that there is only one small tv in a bedroom, none in living area. Also, the kitchen is minimally stocked (no condiments, spices, etc - so pack in what you need if you want to cook). Parking is adequate on the street because it is a very wide street, so there is no worry about cars trying to squeeze through near your car! The bathroom is adequate with a really nice shower, but again, be sure to pack in what you will need. The soap, shampoo, towels are provided, but it’s limited. There are no “extras” like cotton swabs or lotion etc. Overall, it was a nice place to stay and walkable to coffee shops and bike rental if you want to explore the river trail. For some reason, at the time of my stay, the few nice hotels in Pueblo were running very high in price, so this home was priced well due to that."

The area is very nice with beautiful historic homes very close by, but the main road at the corner does have quite a bit of traffic for a residential area. Everything was just as he described except there is no central AC. There is one mini-split, which does a great job, but you have to leave the bedroom doors open if you want those rooms to be cool. Michael was attentive and responded very quickly to our concerns."

The back yard was more than sufficient for my two dogs to play catch, and the bed was absolutely comfortable.
