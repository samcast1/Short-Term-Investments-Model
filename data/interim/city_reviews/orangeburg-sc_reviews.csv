Stayed a few nights",Annette was an amazing host and the house was perfect for what we needed. We were in town for South Carolina State University's homecoming. The house was in close proximity to the university. We were able to enjoy the festivities because we did not have to drive to another city like many of our friends. The small touches in the house such as water and snacks made the stay even more enjoyable. We will certainly stay again if our business brings us to Orangeburg.

There were a few bugs and insects on the premises but nothing too bad. The house is right on a busy street in Orangeburg so entering and exiting the driveway was a bit difficult. Overall it was a decent place to stay and we were comfortable.

Stayed a few nights","The duplex in which the apartment is located is on a well cared-for lot in a single family neighborhood close to shopping and restaurants. Once inside the door you will find yourself in a lovely, comfy, cozy, and really delightful apartment with all the comforts of home, including satellite tv in the bedroom! Our hostess was terrific from the moment we contacted her about reserving the apartment. We were part of a hoard of folks evacuating from hurrican Florence and were so happy to have such an attentive hostess, who was consistently available for help, and questions of any nature from even before we arrived. She made me feel like I was renting from a good friend. It was wonderful to have a fully equipped kitchen so that we could prepare meals without having to brave the storm to find a restaurant. I highly recommend Charming Furnished Apartment and frankly, any property that our hostess, Gale has available."

Stayed about a week","My stay at Gale's house was so outstanding that I had the best vacation time ever. The house was comfortable, cool, and beautifully decorated. Its on a street that hardly had any traffic and that made it very quite and peaceful. It's surrounded big green trees and shrubs, with big front yard and back yard and patio. Its close to Edisto Gardens, practically within walking distance - great for hiking the board walk along the river. The photos of the home on Airnb are spot on. I was thrilled to have all that Sun light coming in.

I would get up early in the morning, sit by the front door and listen to the birds and crickets doing their thing. I don't know if Gale knows this, but every morning about the same time, a humming bird comes to visit the plants on the front porch. I'd run to get my camera, but before I could get back he or she would be gone. LOL.

Gale called often to check on me and I appreciated that and if i need directions, She knew right away how to get there. After a while we would get to talking like I had known her for years, She's so friendly and hospitable. This is a very comfortable spot for vacation, for rest, and to enjoy the peace and love that has been created with in this home. I almost didn't wanna leave, but I will be back."

Group trip","Staying at Lisa's 3-bedroom home was an absolute delight for my family of 6. The accommodations were superb, offering ample space for everyone to unwind comfortably. We particularly appreciated the thoughtful touches like the convenient coffee maker and the provided shampoos and body washes. The keyless entry keypad was a lifesaver, making access to the home hassle-free. Lisa's responsiveness and accommodation of our needs were truly commendable; she swiftly resolved an issue we encountered. I highly recommend this property, especially for those planning a trip to Congaree National Park. It's the perfect retreat after a day of hiking adventures."

Group trip","My apologies to Lisa for taking so long to write the review. My family and I truly enjoyed Don and Lisa's home. From arrival, we were in awe of how spacious the home is. It's very well kept and we truly enjoyed ourselves. Lisa was so helpful and kind hearted. I made a mistake (reading directions and not following) which caused my group and I to be locked out of the house. I contacted Lisa, she was very understanding and provided instructions on how to get back in the house. Thank you Lisa for being so understanding. Everyone in the group wants this to be our go to when our church have a function in Orangeburg, that is, if Don and Lisa will have us back. Again Thank you Don and Lisa and have a truly blessed day."

With the temperature change, they were accommodating and provided a brand-new space heater to warm the back room. We had the heater within an hour of the text.
The home was super clean and spacious for our family of 6. There was enough room for everyone to spread out and have the best family time. The rooms were modern and full of light from the windows and plenty of TVs. The best part of the kitchen was the options for coffee and hot beverages. We will definitely be back to book this home for our upcoming trips to visit our son in college."

Stayed with kids","We really enjoyed the experience, it felt like a home away from home. The house supplied everything we needed from space, amenities, extra supplies, cookware, and entertainment for the whole family to enjoy. Each room had its own special touch to it which fit each of our personalities. The beds were different heights which were perfect for my grandmother and littles. The beds were extremely comfortable.  The olive tree was too cute and added a special touch for the Christmas holiday. My littles woke up today (Christmas Morning) to find their gifts under the olive tree. My two year old said ""Santa came"". We plan to book in the future. Thank you Lisa and Don for everything. Happy Holidays from the Smith's"

Group trip",The accommodations were perfect for our needs! We had an event to attend so we were involved in going and coming often. We felt safe and comfortable. The layout of the house provided younger adults an area to stay and have their space. Lisa might be an interior decorator based on the appeal of the decor. The value was outstanding vs three motel rooms for two nights! If we visit Orangeburg again we will look up Don and LIsa first!!!!!

It is conveniently located for quick access to all that ""The Garden City"" has to offer. Best yet were the hosts themselves. Lisa and Don were super-responsive, and my family and I had the peace of mind in knowing that the answer to any question that we may have was just a simple text away. These accommodations were the key to our great trip. I pray this space is available the next time that we are in the area."

Good amount of storage in the kitchen. The backyard was nice the tree gave a little shade a peaceful getaway when others aren’t around. The nicest and most appreciative touch was the Welcome sign and notes of inspiration in every drawer and dresser. Reading those made me feel connected to the kind people Lisa and Don are. We will certainly spend time there again. God Bless"

Everything you could possibly need and a lot of what you want are provided. VERY clean (received my mother’s seal of approval lol), very quiet, the beds are super comfortable, and a full kitchen with coffee bar.
Plus, there were cute, inspirational notes hidden throughout the house… my family and I found 12 of them (not sure of the total number)"

We really felt right at home and even better I could completely relax and not feel like I had to clean something. Very nice spot.

Trust me this is the place to stay if you need an air bnb in Orangeburg. They did not leave anything out in this home. I stayed for about 2 weeks and i honestly did not want to leave that is how cozy it was. An the area is peaceful and very close to everything in town. I am military and i travel all over the world and i have never stayed in a air bnb so welled put together like this one. They exceeded my expectations book now and you will see what i am talking about. They were definitely a super host!!!!

Stayed with a pet","I appreciate the efforts made to have this place presentable. However, it is an older place and in need of some updates. Beyond renovation related improvements, the furniture pieces could be upgraded. Several items have visible wear and tear, such as the dressers and the lamp in the living room that was previously broken in half and we were extra cautious when having to turn the light on. The area rug in the living area was very dirty and the blue chair had visible dirt along the part that your back rests on. Bugs were seen in both a closet and in a bathroom. Renovations would likely solve a lot of the problems, but simple furniture upgrades would be helpful in the meantime."

Stayed with a pet","I hate to write a bad review. this really was on me. I didn’t read the reviews well, instead I went based on a few pics. I have to say I never contacted her because the issues were not something she was going to be able to fix while we were at her house. It was fairly clean and no major odors noted. However the place needs a face lift. There’s no air flow in bathrooms so u can imagine, hot showers, no air.. pretty sure there was a mold stain on bathroom wall. Bedroom had portable air in bedrooms but the plastic cover on bed made me sweat all night. Beds themselves need to be replaced as they’re uncomfortable ours had a dip in the middle. In kitchen appliances are old, stained and dingy looking. Definitely saw roaches, bugs, place needs regular fumigation. Downstairs air conditioning is central ac but not sure if there’s no insulation or bad AC but u can’t turn on stove for fear of heating up house because cooling the house down takes FOREVER! The place was close to what I needed."

So we always made sure to keep everything sealed and put away & maintained clean counters. Never had an issue.
AC is a little faulty but the host was extremely helpful in getting the air working ASAP so we could sleep. For the space and the convenience of it's location, we'd love to come back again. Lovely condo."

However, we had some challenges with the property for example; not enough towels, only a fitted sheet and comfortable on the bed, no flat sheets, pillows were old, comforter in the downstairs bedroom had a stain on the comforter and bathroom was not clean. In addition only 2 rolls of tissue for both bathrooms. We were disappointed the property had no updates for the price as it was a older property. Host attempted to charge fees after never disclosing prior to booking or inquiring after property was booked. We have booked several properties previously and this was a very disappointing experience."

My only regret was not having enough time to get to speak with our hosts longer which was totally my fault as I was too tired to reach out when we arrived and had to get on the road the next morning. I did speak with them for a few minutes in the morning and was made to feel so comfortable and welcome. Wish I had had more time. Thank you again for the eggs, water and goodies. Sandra and Chester"

The house was just as the pictures showed. The bedrooms were large and more than adequate for the four couples who stayed here. We enjoyed the pool and had lots of laughs there and in the kitchen.
The kitchen had everything we needed or could ask for.
Our group absolutely loved this place and enjoyed our time here. Would highly recommend Candaces place."

Stayed with kids","Hidden Haven was exactly as described. Even though the weather was mostly overcast and rainy during our stay, we enjoyed the outdoor kitchen/patio area everyday and the pool whenever there a a sunny break in the day.
Candace was very responsive to any questions.
Everything we could possibly need to cook our meals was available and they even provided beach towels to use around the pool!
The house does have some decorative items at small child level that you might want to put up higher upon arrival, my 1 year old grandson is still learning what is off limits so we made sure to put some items up higher so he could not get to them.
Overall we enjoyed our stay and would recommend Hidden Haven to anyone staying in the area."

Stayed with kids","This home is a gem! My family and I attended my son's basic training graduation at Fort Jackson, and stayed at this home, which was approximately 40 minutes away. It was simply beautiful and just as described. Candance and her husband are really nice people and very accommodating. Most of our time was spent on the base visiting our son, as both myself and husband (retired army) are prior military. We were exhausted from all the base festivities but Candace's home provided a relaxing atmosphere upon our return. There were 8 of us in total, but there was plenty of room and entertainment for everyone. My teenaged sons loved the basketball court and we had to pry my grandson from the pool. The outdoor space is amazing; my husband was hooked on it. Overall, mission graduation was a success. Thank you again, Candace, for a wonderful stay. We really appreciate it and would highly recommend your home to anyone. Many blessings! LT"

Stayed with kids","Candace is fantastic and her place is outstanding! It was a surprise birthday getaway for my partner! And he loved it! He was weary of where I was taking him- ladies, we know how men like information! Trust was mandatory! We parked in the gated home driveway and entered the gate to find our daughter grilling a steak and the singing began. Happyyy Birrrrrthday to you! His face lit up! The Verona was heavenly! Spacious. Open. Poolside. It allowed our family to enjoy the amenities and especially the escape itself! After sunset, we entered this charming transformation back into history. We love how Candace kept the original character of the home with beautiful touches of contemporary pieces. So inviting and classic. Then a welcoming hygiene gift in every bedroom- pushed customer service to another level!! As a manager in that field, it’s unconsciously automatic to notice when you’re treated with extra care and attention. Thank you, Candace!!! And the recommendations for Cajun Seafood- we thoroughly enjoyed crab legs and shrimp poolside! Delicious! Please keep up the fantabulous service!!!"

She work very hard to get her place ready for us when the place was ready we us the what's up app to communicate. She send them videos on how to enter and exit the property and how to us everything in the movie room which was very helpful. When they arrived at the home it was amazing and beautiful with a lot of space for my family. The home had all the amenities you can think of the room they enjoyed the most was the movie room and the outside around the pool area. Candace was a wonderful host she provided me and my family with, like we would say in the fire serve quick response, no hesitation when calling you back the customer service was very good."

I appreciated that the cleaning fee was reasonable, unlike some AirBnBs, plus the cleaning requirements were reasonable also. Jayme didn’t require us to strip the beds before leaving, saying they wanted us to have a relaxing last morning. Wow! So kind and thoughtful. We definitely will be back!"

Jayme has ensured there are updated and upgraded furnishings and fixtures throughout the residence. The original brickwork enhances the appearance and ties the building to its original construction. As a lifelong 'student' of architecture, the restoration of the hardwood was incredible.
All cooking pots, pans, and utensils are provided as well as lovely silverware. The kitchen is spacious which allowed for great family conversations during meal preparation and social time. We were in Salley for the funeral of my wife's mother in Neeses and the time spent in the kitchen allowed us to enjoy memories of mom.
This beautiful place is now our go-to when in the area visiting family and friends. We highly recommend Jayme's Salley House!"

We didn’t have to worry at all about having to run out to a store especially being in the middle of nowhere.

At first we were slightly apprehensive, but that changed when we got into Jayme's place. It was SO cute inside and clean. The way it was decorated and all the extra special touches made it awesome. My 3 teenage girls said it was one of the coolest places they have stayed. That is high praise. My girls enjoyed some hot chocolate and watching the rain through the windows. I loved listening to the rain on roof. It was very relaxing. Also, Jayme was very friendly during our messages back and forth. We completely enjoyed our stay.

Stayed a few nights","I loved staying at Jayme's place in Salley! It was even more spacious than it looked in the photos. The beds were extremely comfortable, as well as the couch. The kitchen had everything I needed. I appreciated the extra touches that Jayme provided, such as snacks, waters, cleaning wipes, even diapers for those that would've needed it. If you're in the area and need a place to stay or a getaway to relax, I highly recommend staying at Salley House!"

Beautiful place to stay. We loved our stay, very homey but a unique store front twist to it. Host Jayme was very accommodating. It was nice to have plenty of towels and all the little things like a good supply of water, some snacks and games to make us feel at home. Will definitely stay again if we have an opportunity."

Stayed with kids","Blanche's place was a perfect spot to visit for my brother-in-law's university graduation. Everything we needed was there. Dishes, bathroom amenities, linens, space for people to spread out, cook and eat together, charcoal grill, big toy chest for kids, great land for a morning walk around their farm, or coffee on the porch rocking chairs overlooking a small herd of grazing cattle. The pool was refreshing and always available. Blanche and her family who live in a separate house on the property were friendly in our interactions if we happened to cross paths. During our 1 week stay, we were able to use one afternoon to host an informal graduation reception for about 25 people in the front yard under the giant old tree, which was quite special and picturesque. Overall, we couldn't have found a better place! This is a totally unique Airbnb property that's nearly impossible to replicate!"

We celebrated my parents 70th birthday brunch at the Farmhouse before their big event. I am not from the area and everyone including caters, party planners etc were surprised at the hidden treasure I found in Orangeburg! We hope to come back for reunions. There was something in the home for everyone, basketball, children toys, scenery, (didn't see/use pool). I am cold natured but Blanche also provide alternatives for this and it work!

What truly made our stay special was the serenity and privacy this place offered. The tranquil ambiance created a sense of calmness that made our time here incredibly relaxing.

Group trip","Blanche is probably my favorite AirBnb host ever. Super responsive and kind. I accidentally booked the place for a day longer than I intended and she immediately let me change the reservation. She was super prompt in responding. The kitchen and rooms and pool are well equipped with anything you might need. Most of all she was just very very sweet and even helped me decorate for my parents' 40th anniversary surprise, and waited out front in the rain for 30 minutes to intercept my parents and walk them in through the front door at the same time so the surprise was successful. Incredibly kind hosts, beautiful place, and wonderful stay. It couldn't have been a nicer experience. The one thing, which you can probably see from where the house is, is that there's not a lot to do in town so the experience for this stay is really to enjoy the beauty of the house, grounds, and company you bring. Everyone in our group would love to stay again and 1000% would recommend staying here."

The location is secluded, peaceful, and even came with a loving outdoor cat. As a heads' up, GPS will tell you the property is about half a mile further away, down a sketchy dirt road-try entering the name of the farm instead of the address if you do use GPS."

Group trip","The executive board of SC Alpha Delta Kappa chose Blanche’s home for our planning retreat. We require an area big enough to spread out paperwork and computers. The dining room table was perfect. We easily cleared our stuff and all ate together, too.
The home is beautiful. You stop and look at each piece of furniture in awe. Decor included old books, sets of china, and pottery. Blanche said she has worked on every room and found all this herself.
Note homes this old have limited electrical outlets, often in baseboards behind very heavy beds. We laughed at extension cord ends carefully placed on tables and dressers so we could find them. Be patient - you can charge your phones
The old trees in the front and old barn in back were perfect for staging the obligatory group photos.
Imagine first opening the door: the kitchen high top table perfectly set with china, fluted glasses, and flowers.
Our president-elect is considering Blanche’s home for her first retreat."

We saw lots of birds, a couple of small snakes, and an adorable little dog who was very friendly. We rented kayaks from Cope Kayak Company. They picked us up at the house, took us upriver drop in. We floated down to the house and had lunch and a nap, then went the rest of the way to the next landing to be picked up. It was a great day. Thanks for everything!"

We took our 18 ft boat and put it right into the landing on the property. We fished every day we were there. The playground was a wonderful addition since our two younger children were with us. The friendly dog from next door came and visited with us often and even tried to go on a boat ride with us. We played Go-Fish before bed each night and watched a little TV. We also had internet on our phones in case we needed to get in touch with anyone. We got groceries from the Piggly Wiggly in town and cooked all our meals. We had a fire in the firepit and roasted hotdogs and marshmallows. If we could have stayed longer, we would have! We will most definitely be back. Great place if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle and just relax."

The pictures don't do it justice. The home is alot bigger than it looks in the pictures. Will definitely be booking more stays here.

MJ let us use one of the canoes there so the kids had a full day on the river.
The house was large enough, clean, and comfortable. The large kitchen has descent cookware which is rare find with an Air BnB. We made good use of the deck over the river bank and screened back porch. And a Low State oddity... early October and near 0 mosquitos!"

Stayed a few nights","Boyfriend jokes that every time we stay at an AirBnB, I say I would love to live there. This time, he said it too.
This is the perfect place to bring your kids for a family vacation - but also the perfect place for a couples weekend - and somehow also the perfect place for a girl’s getaway, too.
The house was clean, and the huge kitchen was extremely well-equipped. (I had minor pots-and-pans envy while making supper one night.) The Piggly Wiggly down the road had everything we needed. The bedrooms weren’t anything special but they were comfortable, as were the living/dining room, which opened up to an AWESOME screened in porch and then outside.
BUT Y’ALL. OUTSIDE. This is where I about jumped up and down and clapped my hands. THE PHOTOS DON’T DO IT JUSTICE. The water is great for kayaking, the big deck had wonderful, comfortable Adirondack chairs, there was a fire pit with more comfy chairs and tons of sticks and branches for burning, and the RIVER. Beautiful. I was absolutely tickled pink.
I almost hate to write such a glowing review, because it seems like letting a secret out, but we loved this place!"

The electrical does not have grounding, they sorta provide an adapter butI'm not sure it actually does anything. It was not the cleanest either. There were dead bugs on the wall, dirt in the kitchen and bathroom floors. The window sills were dirty also. It did the job, but I wouldn't stay here again unless the upgraded a lot. But the hosts were really great and communicated very well."

Stayed one night","This is truly an instance of, “You get what you pay for.” The unit is small and is outfitted with just the basics. As others have said, there were bugs. It wasn’t infested, but there were several and enough to make us feel like the place was not as clean as it should have been. Also, the dogs kept in the kennel in the back were having a shouting match at 3 a.m. that wasn’t exactly ideal for sleeping. Otherwise, if you need a place to crash overnight, it does the job. Like another guest stated, it gets a bit stale, so bring a fan if you can."

Stayed one night","Check in was very easy and flexible and the general area was clean. However, the pictures are slightly deceiving. The photos of the backyard were taken in a way that hides the dog pen that houses 5 or 6 small dogs that maul each other everytime they see a new dog. It was gut-sinking just to listen to. Another photo that is very misleading is the bathroom, the shower is a converted tub so it is not the sturdiest or the biggest. I am a little taller at 6’3 but the shower barely reached my chest. The wallpaper and floor also need updated as they are peeling and soft. I was also mislead thinking this was a separate building...it was not. There are adjoining doors where we could hear the other residents just on the other side. As for the room itself, it did have all the basics and check in was very easy and flexible."

First, there are a few rooms separated by thin walls and a door. No quiet hours meant we were kept up all night listening to everything the neighbors did. Not fun when you are planning on waking up early.
Second, the place was not clean. Shower had a dirty floor, bathroom had stains on the wall, and on the bed sheet had a very large stain right in plain sight. It was disgusting.
Yeah it’s cheap, but this is the type of place that gives Airbnb a bad reputation- no reason not to go to a hotel / motel and at least get some real sleep for the night."

Stayed a few nights","I believe Gale’s goal is to get a 5 star ⭐️ review. I would have given her that except a few things that occurred during our stay. First of all I had originally booked a different until but she had the opportunity to rent out my booking to someone for an extended amount of time. She requested that I switch to a different house. My issue with that was that the second houses beds didn’t look as comfortable as the one I had originally booked. She offered a larger selection at no extra cost. She asked me when I booked if it was just me. I said yes but I’m going to try to find someone to share the cost of the unit as we had an event while there and wouldn’t really be there except to sleep and shower. At that time she let me know that if I switched houses she wouldn’t charge me extra for added guest. Once we arrived and my friend got there first she told her that it would be extra because she only charged me for one person. Once I found out I had to contact her to remind her of our agreement. At that point she told me that I needed to leave a tip for the house keeper which was not what she originally said. Then I asked her how much she expected me to tip and I did leave that much of a tip. Second, a day into our stay she informed me that the internet wasn’t working and asked if she could bring the guy in to fix it. I informed her that it was working fine for us that morning (we were at our event from 9am-9pm each day so we weren’t there). She then informed me that the internet where she had cameras on our driveway weren’t working and couldn’t see our activity and it was bothering her. I then gave my permission for her to enter the house. We didn’t really want to because our personal belongings were in the house but complied. At one point when the lady who picked us up was there and we were loading into the car she came up to the car inquiring about how many people were in the car to see if she could charge us more. If these things hadn’t occurred I would have given 5 stars ⭐️ but just couldn’t as we felt spied on and like we had to give permission to enter the house without us being there. She said she got the cameras working and didn’t actually access the house to do it but the request was uncomfortable. I believe once they entered the house after we left they may have felt bad about making me leave a tip or spying on us. The only things we used was the bed, bathrooms, coffee maker and kitchen trash. One other thing the couch in the front room smelled like dirty feet. It’s only the section that is closest to the front door. We only sat in there a couple times during our week stay. The house was beautiful and very clean when we arrived. It’s also in a safe neighborhood. She also must own the house next door as they looked like they were there to clean it when they approached us in the car that morning. I do believe Gale has pride in her houses and cleanliness of her places. She is also kind but may have so many houses she forgets what she says to you in the original booking. I felt as though she got me to switch by offering me the extra guest for free but then made me pay it in a tip. If I had rentals I may be concerned about who is there and could potentially trash my beautiful home and I get that. However we only slept and showered there so it wasn’t called for with me but possibly would have been a different story with someone else. I would rent from her again but would definitely get more in writing."

The best part of the stay were the beds -- they were soooo comfortable. Gale was a very responsive host -- there were some kitchen items that weren't in the house that she was able to bring to us, which was super convenient given we stayed for a long length of time. The outdoor covered deck was also very peaceful, along with the backyard. If you are looking for a comfortable place to stay in Orangeburg, this is the place!"

Stayed with kids","I recently had the pleasure of staying at Dina's place for three days, and I wanted to share some helpful insights with future potential bookers:
1) The accommodation is located in Dina's basement. I came across a review mentioning this after I made my booking, so if staying in a basement isn't your preference, it's best to consider other options.
2) Please note that the windows in the accommodation do not open. If having fresh air and natural light in your space is important to you, it's worth considering alternatives.
3) The rooms themselves are quite and comfortable. However, it's worth mentioning that there is no closet. Dina has cleverly addressed this by installing hooks over the doors where you can hang your garments.
4)It's important to be aware that you may come across a few baby frogs indoors. If you're not a fan of frogs, whether they are inside or outside (as you will most definitely also spot them outdoors), this might not be the best fit for you."

Stayed one night","Oh my goodness! This place is plumb precious! There is a beautiful piece of pottery on the mantle! The grounds are so peaceful! I hope this well loved cabin is finally on the national registry! The hosts left delicious pecan fudge for us, and healing water from a spring from nearby Blacksburg! The bed was very comfortable!! I loved the pocket door in the bathroom. The kitchen area was nicely supplied with everything you’d need for coffee or hot chocolate. There is a lovely table and chair set. The living room featured an electric fireplace, tv with dvds, and plaid comfortable couch. There was a remote to the heater. Best of all, the hosts allowed us to bring our pets, Molly and Daisy!! We can’t wait to come back again to this perfect vacation cabin! Pam, James, Molly n Daisy Gray 🤗❤️🙏🐶"

Stayed one night","I am 6’ tall with very long legs and not super skinny but not obese either. Other reviews said how small the bathroom was, but not that my knees would hit the plumbing under the sink when I sat on the toilet! The shower was also too small for me to get into. I felt like a giant and I was uncomfortable in the space.
Luckily, the location was perfect and I was able to spend all my time out and about. The host was also kind enough to let me get access early so I didn’t have to lug my suitcase while walking around.
In short, if you’re not super tall or have super long legs, you’ll probably do okay here."

My husband read and I worked on cross stitch. If you are needing some quiet time this is a perfect place to stay. John was so accommodating."

His wife made home made sourdough bread and delivered some to us (super thoughtful). The cabin itself was neat and clean. The fireplace was a plus as it got a bit chilly during our stay. The bed was super comfy and we slept like rocks! Thank you for an unforgettable birthday weekend."

Stayed with a pet","The Mulberry Cabin was a perfect stopping point for us on our road trip. John was a fantastic host, responsive to our messages and went above and beyond by leaving us some delicious fudge and homemade sourdough bread. The cabin had everything we needed, was very clean, and a wonderful historic building on top of it! We really enjoyed hearing two trains during our stay, but there were ear plugs if that’s not your speed. Our dog loved exploring the backyard. Highly recommend staying here."

The commute was about 1 hour 15 minutes in jormal traffic to 1 hour 40 minutes from downtown Charleston when there was rush hour traffic and an accident on I-26. The cottage has a pretty backyard and while you definitely hear road noise, I found it to be peaceful. I hope to stay there again soon!"

Stayed one night","Beautiful stay in this gorgeous cozy cabin. It was one of my favorite airbnbs I have ever stayed in. Although I read in reviews that it was just off a somewhat main road, I didn't find it to be any problem at all and it was perfectly quiet. I felt safe and tucked away underneath the gorgeous tree in the front yard and giant fragrant blooming Lillies. The bed was extremely comfortable and the curtains kept it dark and let me sleep in. Although there was no wifi it was actually very charming to spend the night watching from the great selection of DVDS. The delicious homemade fudge and local healing spring water were beautiful touches. I cannot recommend this place highly enough. An absolute gem."

Stayed with a pet","The outside photographs suggest Mulberry cottage is not everyone's cup of tea. But the outside appealed to me, and I don't think anyone would have a complaint about the inside. I was traveling alone with my dog. I spent the night without disturbance in a clean, comfortable bed and I left in the morning without disturbing any neighbors. I loved the sense of peacefulness this habitat provided. I would go back in a minute if it were on my routes, and I would stay for a week if it was within my timetable. Thank you John and Cindy for allowing me to enjoy your property."
