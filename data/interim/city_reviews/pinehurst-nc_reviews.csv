Stayed a few nights","We had a wonderful stay, great views of the golf course, comfortable and clean living space. We loved the assortment of snacks provided when we arrived. Very responsive host, loved the surrounding area of Pinehurst/Southern Pines that only took minutes to drive to. Great local restaurants nearby, easy parking and all around great price for the accommodation! We will definitely be returning!"

The condo was beautiful- extremely clean, well equipped, comfortable and in a great location. And not to mention that the view of the golf course was excellent.

Everything including the hosts were a step up not that my previous condo was bad, this was just more my style. I just had back surgery so being on the second floor was a bit difficult but it won't be a problem next year, and the year after and so on. Highly recommend."

We were traveling all day before arrival, and everything was perfect when we finally arrived; check in was super easy, the unit was at a nice temperature, and everything was perfect allowing us to quickly get settled in and comfortable after a long day of travel.

Stayed with kids","We had the absolute best stay at Dixie, Will and Charles’s place. We felt completely at home. Everything was clean, comfortable and cozy. Check in was a breeze. We were in town for our daughter’s golf tournament and she loved watching other golfers playing from the balcony. The surrounding area was nice and quiet. We even met a few neighbors and chatted up with them and their fur babies. My daughter also loved the Camelot Park that was only a few miles away. If you have little ones this is the perfect spot for a little fun. We will definitely be staying again in the future. If you are looking at staying close to the main Pinehurst clubhouse and good food look no further than The Long Drive on 5!
Thank you"

Stayed a few nights","I cannot say enough about how wonderful our stay was. I was hesitant to book because it was a relatively new listing, but since all the reviews were so positive, I took my chances. I’m so glad that I did! Dixie is extremely responsive and answered all my questions almost immediately. Check in was extremely easy with the code provided so no need to worry about keys or locking the door.
The condo itself is lovely, modern, beautifully decorated and everything seemed new and spotless. Lots of snacks available as well as coffee and tea. I enjoyed getting up each morning and sitting on the balcony with my coffee overlooking the golf course.
The club house is within walking distance if you so desire.
The full bed is very comfortable and I appreciated the luggage rack that was in the closet.
The information book Dixie left has everything you’ll need. I’d give this place a 10 if I could! We hope to come back!! Thank you for sharing your lovely place with us!"

And a little extra that I enjoyed was the unit has cable and streaming services. A lot of places only offer streaming, but appreciated access to networks during March Madness!"

Group trip","The Riggs Cottage is as charming and incredible as it seems! The views of the championship course were amazing and the putting green was not only great for the golf fans in our family but the toddler as well. It was also in an amazing location within Pinehurst. Two minute drive to the village and the resort.
We had 4 couples and the cottage provided plenty of space for parking with inside the house not feeling cramped. Bedrooms were spacious as well trying to fit in portable cribs for kids. Kyle was also very fast to respond to any questions we had.
The only downside we were short a couple towels and felt like some of the areas of the house could have been a little cleaner.
We would stay here again and will try to in the future!"

The view on the patio of the golf course is quite lovely, and it's a peaceful respite from the city. My one complaint, if you could call it that, would be the fold-out sofa. It's quite hard and not really comfortable for an adult. Other than that, the bed is wonderfully comfortable, and everything else was perfect! Highly recommend."

Stayed a few nights","Just as described and clean and easy to find. There were a few things I would suggest. the TV placement to the setting area is not convenient to watching, since it is off to the side. the curtains over the sliding door do not cover the entire window and therefore people can see in always. The bedroom was beautiful and bed super comfy, slept so well, however there is no ceiling fan and no TV. I need both of these to fall asleep since I have anxiety at night so I ended up using my iPad and turning on the fan on HVAC unit all night. Otherwise it was a great stay and beautiful surroundings. Thank you."

Enjoyed my stay; Keurig works well!!!
Traffic thru there is getting a little crazy with the impending US Open/construction/etc. My advise to anyone who stays there is: no matter what your GPS says, when you're coming out of the condo complex, turn right on Pine Tree Road, then take St Andrews Road to get to wherever you're going. Beulah Hill (5) is extremely busy traffic-wise. Be safe!"

No golf for me on this “one-night stand” but the location is good and overlooks Course #5. The place was spotless and the bed was comfortable.
Due to the nature of my trip (had to leave at 7:30 am), I can’t really speak to the amenities, but the welcome folder was great and very thorough."

Stayed one night",This was a very cute place! It was easy to find with the name on a decorative barrel outside. Keyless access was available and always great! The king bed was a great touch as well as the Keurig with pods available. We struggled to switch the shower on and right in the welcome binder we found easy instructions to get it! Tessa was more than accommodating and was very responsive. We would stay here again!!

Stayed one night","Although it was a planned one-nighter, we would have loved to have stayed longer at the Caddyshack on 5. Tessa's place is so clean, neat & well organized. It was perfect for a twosome like us who are out-n-about but like a quiet little place with a comfy living room with big screenTV to relax in at the end of the day & uber comfortable king bed to sleep in. The kitchen is fully functional if you want to eat-in & the little outdoor deck affords you the opportunity to take your favorite libation & relax to a good view of one of the fairways of Pinehurst #5 (which in our case was snow but nonetheless beautiful & tranquil). The location is close to everything Pinehurst & Southern Pines. If you enjoy watching the horses work out (which they were on a 25º morning), the horse track is directly across the street.
Pinehurst is a short distance trip for us & we come there often. We hope to stay at the Caddyshack again, only a few nights longer preferably. 5 stars & highly recommend it."

Stayed a few nights","Delightful, light, airy decor. Most everything needed was available. The kitchen was well appointed with dishes, cookware, etc. Excellent set up of bar cart if you need those items. Washer and dryer available across the parking lot in an outside building. Parking for this unit is not at the door, and most availability is to the far right of the next door building.
Deck out back is coolest and best for mornings...full sun most of the afternoon. Watching golfers come and go proved to be quite amusing!
Communication pre/post stay was timely from this host.
Do note that although this bath has a hand-held shower installed, the plumbing is bypassed and is TUB ONLY. The listing SAYS tub, but Air B&B icon shows a tub with shower overhead, which is not the case. (Maybe Air B&B could correct their icon for clarity). It is a lovely, large garden tub, and as so prevents easy leaning over the edge to wash hair.
If you're a lover of a completely dark room to sleep in, I suggest bringing black poster board and painter's tape to block light from the security light in the parking lot that's just outside the bedroom window. There's a Dollar General a few miles down the road where you can purchase items if needed. The windows have nice, wooden venetian blinds, but light leaks around the edges...something certainly not in control of the host unless black out curtains are added. Poster board and tape do the trick nicely, and I use this simple fix lots of times when traveling.
Great location in the Pinehurst area, just beyond the Village proper, with limitless options in type and $-$$$$ range for dining available."

No matter why you are visiting the area the location is perfect for golfing, visiting the Pinehurst resort, shopping, and is in close proximity to plenty of restaurants. Or if you are having a lazy afternoon and dont feel like going out there are plenty of options for food delivery on Uber eats or door dash.
The photos posted on the site are a true representation of what to expect during your stay. Checking in was extremely easy and the host was available almost immediately upon contact. While I barely used the kitchen it was very well stocked and should I have wanted to cook everything I needed was right there. The condo gives off a really calming vibe with the paint colors and decor which made it really easy to relax after a long day. The bed was super comfortable; probably some of the best sleep I've gotten in a while. Check out was just as easy as the owner provided a booklet that gave instructions on what to do with linens and trash.
I would definitely stay here again."

She thinks of everything and is very accommodating. Things we loved: .4 mile walk to Pinehurst Resort, peaceful, comfortable, relaxing, and very clean. The condo is located on the second floor overlooking a Pinehurst resort course par 5. The view is mostly shielded by a large magnolia type tree, offering much shade and privacy which we appreciated after a long summer day on the course."

The condo is eye-pleasing with a comfortable minimalist decor. It has all that you would hope would be supplied in an AirBnb (and has a few extras). The condo was also exceptionally clean and easy to access. To top it all off, the beds and linens were extremely comfortable. A bonus was resting under the pines on the balcony in the rocking chairs - a delightful way to enjoy the golf course setting. Don't hesitate, book this beautiful condo for your Pinehurst stay!"

We each had our own bedroom a bathroom and coomon areas to watch tv and shoot pool together. Great vale. (Additionally, one of the guys left his iPad and we had already checkedout and were on the golf course when he realized it.

The pictures of the house don’t do it justice. The rooms were spacious and clean. The kitchen was a chefs dream made for entertaining and the amenities in the yard and garage tied our experience together nicely. We felt like we were at “home” or in a 5 star resort the moment we walked through the doors. All the little details were paid attention to that allowed us to enjoy a first class experience with a fantastic WOW factor at every turn. We were close to lots of amenities in the community and the customer service/communication from our host including recommendations for food was stellar. The house has everything, whether you are doing a guys golf trip like us or bringing the family along. We look forward to making this an annual experience."

Stayed one night","Felicia's ""treehouse"" is an absolute perfect couple's getaway! If you're looking for a unique and cozy place to stay, this is it. Plus it is just a quick drive to the village, food and Southern Pines.
The treehouse itself is different and fun. It's been beautifully remodeled and has a warm, inviting vibe. We loved that Felicia thought of everything you'd need and her attention to detail was a very nice touch and made our stay even more special. The treehouse was spotless, smelled neutrally clean, and very well organized.
This place totally lives up to the hype. If you get the chance, definitely book it – you won't be disappointed!"

Stayed one night","The treehouse is absolutely charming. It’s much bigger than we imagined. Everything is so well organized and thought out, and available right where it needs to be within your reach. It’s very very clean. One of the most clean air B&Bs we’ve been in. Our GPS kind of had us lost, we were looking for building 70 versus unit two so that’s probably why. That was our mistake. Turning in and out off the main road is tight & hard to see, so be careful. The view was spectacular. We couldn’t ask for a better stay, it is a perfect place to get away yet still be close to all of the surrounding amenities in Pinehurst."

I could not ask for any place nicer or more convenient. The view of the lake made our stay so peaceful. This is our new weekend getaway and we cannot wait to return! The host could not have been more responsive, and we had everything we needed. Thank you Felicia!"

Stayed a few nights","Five star in every respect. Pinehurst is well known as a golfer’s paradise. But I now know it as the town that has the “Knotty But Nice Treehouse” – which is one of the most beautifully decorated, serene, tranquil, and relaxing places we’ve ever visited. We thoroughly enjoyed sitting on the deck, watching the fish jump in the lake, the rabbits foraging on the lawn, the hummingbirds flitting about, and the deer with her two fawns who made regular appearances. We highly highly recommend the treehouse for a getaway, or a long vacation, and if you want to play a round of golf, then that’s OK too."

While not lakefront, you have a great view of the lake from the deck. Everything was exactly as described and looked like the pictures. Felicia is a great host, very communicative and offered good recommendations. The kitchen appeared to be well stocked, however we only took advantage of the wine glasses.
Walking to the Village of Pinehurst is an option, not far, but the roads are narrow without a shoulder.
Add a little whimsy to your next stay in Pinehurst and stay in the treehouse."

The whole area is so charming. The neighborhood is magical. And the treehouse itself is beautifully-furnished and such a lovely place to get away from it all and just relax (while still being just a couple minutes from all the amenities you could ever want or need.) We also really appreciated the 10 pm ""quiet hours"" in the community, which provided an extra layer of peace and relaxation. A total gem of an airbnb from check-in to check-out!

Stayed one night","Lovely, unique property in a quiet location. Property kind of reminds me of something you would see in a classic James Bond movie - just is kind of retro and different. Excellent location minutes from Pinehurst Resort and all that Pinehurst has to offer. Very clean with nice features (i.e., pretty views from deck, etc.) and amenities (i.e., very walk in large shower, etc.). Check-in and check-out very straightforward and easy. We enjoyed our stay very much."

Stayed a few nights","Everything about our stay was beyond perfect. The treehouse is such a unique stay and the perfect location to anything you would like to do or need. Felicia has thought of all the right touches to make your stay comfortable, clean, and welcome. The decor is perfectly knotty! We loved the balcony with a view of the lake and the floor to ceiling windows with views of the golf course and the addition of all the sunlight. We highly recommend a stay with Felicia and her Knotty Treehouse."

Stayed a few nights","Oh, how I enjoyed my stay in Felicia's lovely treehouse! I chose this listing because it looked creative and charming, with spacious views, and I had a good deal of reading , writing, and study to do in just a few days. I needed a serene space with expansive views. Felicia's home was all of that and more. The space is SO creative, the kitchen well-equipped, the home spotless, the neighbors friendly, the decor creative. The treehouse has lovely, full-length windows all around, and they open to serene views of a golf course in the back and a sparkling lake in the front. And I could read and study on the deck until it got too dark to see, all the while watching the beautiful colors in changing sunsets. The home feels tucked-away, but Pinehurst is just a short drive away for food and fun. This was a solo trip for me, but I've already raved about it to my husband, and I'd go back in a heartbeat. Thank you for a lovely stay, Felicia."

Stayed a few nights","The venue was exactly what I was looking for. It came stocked with everything needed. The fiance and I wanted a small two day getaway to celebrate him finishing his military contract as well as expecting our first child together. It waa very peaceful and close by to shopping, resturants, and activities. One night we stayed in and the next we went to Red's Corner and a sip and paint. We are planning to come back in the future."

Stayed a few nights","Do not hesitate to book the Knotty But Nice Treehouse. It is so unique, cozy, well-appointed, and CLEAN. The location is central to nearly anything you could want to do in Pinehurst, and the community is very picturesque and quiet. You can tell from the moment you enter that Felicia puts a lot of effort into making sure guests have a great experience."
