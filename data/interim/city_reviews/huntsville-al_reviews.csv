Stayed a few nights","The Hosts were extremely nice and responsive. Photos of Airbnb were stunning but the actual listing fell beneath my expectations. Home was quite dusty and some areas unclean/kept. Home hasn’t been dusted, vacuumed, or sweep/mopped. It was difficult to change AC/Heat on units but Hosts were very responsive. There were no towels in bathrooms. They were found in the dryer I guess from previous rentals. Restrooms were not as clean as I would have liked for new rentals. It seems as if property hadn’t been rented in a while and just a little more TLC would have been appreciated. Our guest that stayed in the downstairs bedroom had an unexpected guess (mice). The balcony was not clean at all and enjoyable for us. The neighbors seemed fine at first but late at night it was a lot of loud music played (this was during the week day). With a few upgrades and TLC this property will be keynote. I do appreciate the Host and their home. Just constructive criticism."

Group trip","Difficulty getting in on day of arrival due to keypad lock not working. Delay in response through app to provide instructions for getting in; however, only about 30 minutes. Place was clean and exactly as described. Instructions for the AC/Heating would be a recommendation for leaving guests. Overall, great value for the area and the theme of John Wick is excellent."

Stayed with kids","All and all the place was ok, but not at all the upscale place we were expecting. I did not like the fact that I was sent a door code for a lock that was known to be out of order. While the host was prompt with responding that the lock didn’t work and a key was available, I had no plans to keep up with someone else’s house key when “keyless entry” was part of my search criteria. For us, the best thing about it was that it was centrally located near the places we had planned to visit. We traveled with our young children and this home is not at all kid friendly. Additionally, the exterior was not clean with trash bins strewn over the front lawn. We did not feel safe in the area as people were walking up and down the street and cars were stopped in the middle of the road. While the house was ok for the one night we stayed, it needs some attention to be brought up to its upscale billing."

Group trip","I was very pleased with our stay,
Just checking in I had to get in touch with host bc the keypad wasn’t working and instead of letting me know ahead of time we had to call just to found out it wasn’t working at the time😟 and the key was left for us… also the shower downstairs had stopped working😶‍🌫️ I really think it’s was bc of the temperature outside not sure if it was frozen but the bathroom was freezing cold as well🥶… the dining area wasn’t enough seating at the dinner table at a table to seat maybe 6-8 only 3 chairs so we really couldn’t eat all together☹️..But I can SAY Theses things are somewhat minor but my overall stay was 10/10 🥰 I’m definitely looking forward too booking again ! In warmer weather just to enjoy the upstairs patio 🌞….
Peace & Love"

We have stayed at multiple different properties of theirs and all of them have been great. We will continue to support them and stay at their homes because of how awesome they are as hosts and the homes they offer!

Group trip",A group of us came to Huntsville to see a concert at the Orion. The house was perfect. Plenty of room and beds and showers. Felt right at home. There were two chairs in the dining room that were a little sketchy to sit on and there were only 4 forks to use but besides that everything was great! The beds were comfy and the air conditioning was fantastic. We didn't spend any time on the deck because it was so hot out but it looked nice for a cooler evening. If you are looking for a spacious house close to everything then this is the spot for you. Thank you Eric and Lavena for your hospitality.

Stayed with kids","What a delightful and comfortable stay this was, especially when you have two kids who get a lot of anxiety when sleeping in new places (hotels are especially stressful for them). Yet here, they told me they felt like they were home. They loved how open the living room was with the stairs going up and they could easily call to each other, see each other whichever floor they were on.
The hosts were very proactively communicative, and responded quickly.
The kids said if we come back to the Huntsville area again, they don't want me to look at other options. They want to stay HERE! Can't get a better recommendation than that! 😎👍"

Stayed one night","Top notch hosts with a top notch home. Mr Wick is sharp, cool, comfortable and clean. The epitome of first class STRs. Dripping with creative design, inside and out. This is the Best rental in Huntsville so far, without a doubt. Even after nearly 6 straight months renting homes in HSV (with employees in tow). There is no competition. If there was, this probably ate them before their first client confirmed their booking. It naturally stands apart from all the rest. It’s as if the coolness reactor experienced a critical, catastrophic meltdown, blasting this home with massive doses of cool for the last 12,000 years, culminating in its current form available for our enjoyment! Unless you double the price point, there’s nothing to even compare to. I woke up the first day 12 percent cooler and 9.3 percent more handsome. Will definitely stay here again! Wish I had booked a month."

The location is 10 min from the school! In addition to this I was traveling with 2 adults and 2 babies under the age of 2. I was so worried about the place not having enough space for everyone! There was so much space for everyone! I’m addition the this, their place is cozy, comfortable, and clean. If you are looking for a temporary stay in the Huntsville area please do not hesitate to book with this family! They are so friendly as well.

Stayed a few nights","Cute place, not big but well situated so that there was plenty of room and the master bedroom was pretty large and had an unheard of (in a home this size) king-sized bed. All of the furniture was very comfy and clean. The kitchen was huge, although we spent little time in the house and did not cook, it was a nice kitchen for anyone who wanted to do so! The house on one side of this home was absolutely beautiful and well landscaped and maintained and the one of the other side was not-so that was truly the only slight negative. Either way-it didn’t bother us and we spoke to neighbors when we took short walks and they were always very nice! I would definitely recommend this home! Oh! The second bedroom has a queen-sized bed, so there’s room for two kids!"

loved the bathtub. Most remodeled airbnbs only have showers. It was nice to enjoy a long soak in a bubble bath. It was the main reason we booked this particular airbnb.

This really is a wonderful little gem. we will be back."

This was my first experience using AirBnB and I am very pleased with the service, communication, and accommodations.
I enjoyed my stay at Michael and Jamie's cozy home. I felt right at home. It was comfortable and I felt safe.
I was able to meet the hosts as we arrived at the same time. They were checking on something from the previous guests. Their sweet son helped to carry my bag inside. Thank you Michael! I found everything I needed in the house with no problem. Oh and the bed was to die for. I slept soooo good.
I would stay there again in a heartbeat. It was convenient to everything I needed, a quick jump on I-565 or Memorial Pkwy and I had everything at my fingertips. I want to try out their other property next time I'm in Huntsville.
Kudos to you, Jamie and Michael and kids, well done! See you next time."

Stayed with kids","A+ Owners, but some room for improvement. Unfortunately upon arrival we found a very strong cigarette smoke smell in the main bedroom, & then we later moved the living room ottoman to lay down a play mat for our infant & found smashed & whole cereal/crumbs. Food also smeared on to the wall behind the sofa & what looked like chocolate stains on the arm of the sofa. Needless to say at first felt very dirty, opposite of the many reviews saying how clean it was. I messaged Mike & Jaime several times, who were wonderful & responsive, &did everything they could to rectify the situation. Ultimately issues were fixed minus the smoke smell coming back. Bonus: Cute place, Bed is SO comfy & bath towels were plush & smelled amazing. Suggestions: 1) To fine previous guests for smoking when there’s clearly marked signs saying No Smoking. 2) Label remotes as all 3 were left in the wrong corresponding rooms. 3) Have a deep clean after long term guests, blinds were dusty & walls/doors need wiped down"

Stayed with kids","Beautiful house , I have stayed in a lot of Air BNB and this was one of my favorites. Whoever cleans it does a fabulous job and I have pretty high standards due to owning a cleaning business. It was a home away from home. I was 1000% recommended. They are also the nicest people & go out of their way to do what they can. Very grateful that I got to meet them!
Beds are comfy and their are TVs in every room which you don’t find a lot, also dresser space another thing I don’t find in homes for some reason. We need places to store clothes. They had everything plus more. Every cooking thing you might need . You can tell they care and are not in this to JUST make money.
We appreciate you guys!
Thank you . 🥰"

Close to Dollar General for small items, Exxon with the best Pizza, and O’Reilly for auto parts. Property is in a residential neighborhood. There are neighbors on both sides who respect privacy but are welcoming & helpful. We had a minor issue with our SUV : no fret… Neighbor to the rescue! The neighborhood is clean & quiet but not intimidating. The house looks just like the pictures (better in real life)! We had a teenage boy and an 8 year old girl who were quite pleased. My husband is a carpenter and gave the house 2 thumbs up!
Spacious enough for the four of us!
The only downside side to our trip was that it had to come to an end!
Would recommend these hosts!"

I booked a same-day, last-minute stay for friends of mine whose baby had been transferred to Huntsville hospital NICU and they needed a close place to stay. The communication with the hosts, Michael and Jamie was extremely prompt and accommodating at such short notice. The home was welcoming, very clean, and they went above and beyond to make sure my friends were cared for, able to relax and felt at home during their stay. Highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","I am so picky about my airbnb and this was the best one I have stayed at in a long time. Michael and Jamie really know how to run an airbnb. It looks newly remodeled, super clean and comfortable. I actually asked her what kind of bed their king bed was because I want one for our own home. Imo there is nothing more important than sleeping well in an airbnb and they nailed it. They were also super hospitable. Jamie messaged me to check in and make sure I got in okay and also checked in to make sure we were comftorable. I would definitely stay here again next time I'm in town."

Stayed a few nights","Host was very responsive, kind and helpful. Beds were comfortable and linens were sufficient. The big chair in the living area was broken, the coffee maker was full of old coffee grounds, and the washing machine was broken (which we discovered after we put a load of clothes in and filled it with water). After reaching out to the host about it, he made a couple of suggestions of how to fix it, but neither worked. Rain leaked into the apartment’s entryway. The kitchen was functional, with the basic necessary utensils but there were only 4 dishes, 4 coffee mugs, 4 bowls, and 4 cups, and no wine glasses or corkscrew.
I didn’t visit the on-site gym, but the day we went to the pool, the water was cloudy and a bit green so we did not stay. Location was relatively convenient: a short drive to grocery store, restaurants, and other shopping. There was some highway traffic noise outside the bedroom windows at night.
Overall, it wasn’t terrible, but it isn’t somewhere I will stay again."

Stayed a few nights","Great location within blocks of downtown area. Was an affordable space. Check in was easy but the driveway is for a single car only to pull in behind a full wooden privacy fence gate. Additional parking is on the street only. The gate opens into a school parking lot. This is a cute place but it is a converted pool house/small guest house and is all one room with several beds/fold out smaller couch. The bathroom is separate with stackable washer/dryer combo. It fit our needs for two nights but it would have been nice if we had been told in advance that the main house/yard/pool areas were all undergoing remodel/renovation projects during our stay. There were air hoses, air compressors and work equipment throughout the driveway/ yard areas when we arrived and the workers had to come running to move things so we could pull in to park. The yard is dirt with a few stepping stones to the deck to get into the space so we were worried about tracking in dirt as well. The bed was comfy though."

Stayed a few nights","This is the second time we have stayed here, and this is easily one of the top five AirBnBs we have used.
The small house is a perfect size for two people. Parking is secure, and for a place inside Huntsville proper, it is very quiet at night. We feel really, really safe when we are here.
The Keurig was well stocked with Kroger Donut Shop coffee.
We stayed here for an event at the Von Braun Center, which was perfect. The VBC is 1.1 miles away, about a five minute drive in morning traffic. It's pretty much a straight shot from Margaret's place. There is a small Thai restaurant 1,000 feet from our door. Just walk along the tree lined street, and bingo, it's dinner time.
We didn't see or interact with our host, because honestly, there was no need. The entry instructions worked fine, everything was self-explanatory, and everything we should have had was right where it should have been.
The A/C worked great, even in the August heat.
We hope to return here next year."

Stayed a few nights","Margaret and Patty are lovely! The guest house is actually a converted pool house and their yard is great. My only issue was the lock, they have a non traditional keypad on a screen, so no tactile surface + the numbers aren’t in the usual keypad order + the screen is VERY dim so it is EXTREMELY hard to see and put in their several-number long digit code. We were stuck in a storm getting rained on for like 10 minutes trying to see / work this lock. If you are at all visually impaired or dyslexic, this will be a struggle for you to get into. I wish I had known how inaccessible this lock is before we had booked😹 But the place is clean!"

We didn’t walk into downtown but easily could have if we were willing to add an extra 12-20 minutes on the front and back end of our outings. Very close driving to pretty much anything and everything we wanted to see. Would stay here again if in Huntsville."

Parking behind the wooden fence is not cumbersome at all, it's an easy thing, and made us feel like we were inside the castle walls.
Comfortable is the best one-word description. The bed? Lawd, like sleeping on a familiar cloud.
Well-stocked kitchen. Dinnerware, appliances, wine glasses, and the bathroom has a stacked washer/dryer.
Honestly, you could bring your own groceries and what you'd save on eating out would pay for the rental.
At night it was quiet and peaceful.

Stayed about a week","I stayed at Margaret's place for 7 nights when I was visiting family in town. It was a perfect location for my needs and roomy for 2 people. The main downside to my experience was that the space was very stuffy in the warmer temperatures. There is an AC unit that needs to be on continuously to vent the space, and it is very loud. As well, parking inside the manual gate can be a bit cumbersome, especially if it is raining. Margaret responded to my messages quickly. I would stay here again in the cooler months. All the best and thank you, Laurie"

Stayed a few nights","Margaret’s guesthouse was great! It was in a quiet neighborhood that was a 15 min walk from downtown Huntsville, and every location we needed was, at most, 20 minutes away. It was also close to a gas station and the highway.
Save for a few cobwebs, the guesthouse was very clean. There was no dust, the AC unit worked to cool down the house quickly, and the shower delivered hot water almost immediately. The bed was firm, which I like, but keep that in mind for those who prefer soft beds. The couch was very comfortable. We did not use the kitchen, but it was clean and had plenty of amenities.
This was a great stay for our short trip!"

The description given beforehand, and even written on the tenant note inside, does not accurately depict the space limitations. Confinement to the porch area is not explicit, and should be, considering the area directly outside our window is off-limits. Neighbors were quite aggressive, which certainly detracted from the feeling of security. If the description was more accurate, this location is otherwise great, and u would recommend it, granted a few small changes."

Quiet neighboorhood and enjoyed walking around the village."

Stayed about a week","My wife and I were visiting family in the area and stayed for 7 nights in this spacious, comfortable, peaceful and relaxing home. The surrounding pine trees and the view of the mountain from the front porch was beautiful trade-off as compared to the parking lots and busy roadways we typically see outside the windows of homes in chain hotels we've stayed in previously. And yet this home is twice as nice and half the cost - and has more room, too. We won't hesitate to stay there again next time we're in Huntsville."

Stayed a few nights","This was the cleanest place I've ever stayed! It felt like I was the first person to stay there. There's a full kitchen with an air fryer, dish washer, microwave, full size fridge and freezer, huge sink and an oven and stove. The bathroom was spotless with a very nice shower. The place is practically brand new. The living room is cozy and has a desk if you need to work from home and a table for two so you can eat separately from your work space. There's a TV in the living room and the bedroom. It's about 15 to 20 min from downtown so it's quiet, but you can get in to the city quickly for some great food, drinks or activities. Frederick gave me some great suggestions on what things to do and see while I was in town. He is very quick to respond and even got there fast to help with check-in when I couldn't figure out the door key pad (user error lol). I would 100% stay here again and highly recommend this property."

Vanessa could not have been a better host to me + my family. We came up for a few days to experience a snow day or two and ended up staying the week due to closed roads. Not only did she offer to let us use their washing facilities since we extended our stay but they offered to grab us supplies from the store + even let our kiddos use their sled!

Stayed with a pet","As avid outdoor enthusiasts, we usually prefer to lodge at state parks when exploring a new area. We needed a pet-friendly cabin, and there were none available at Monte Sano State Park, so I looked around and found Nolen cabin on AirB&B. It was perfect! We were so excited to see deer in the backyard as we pulled into the driveway. Later, we fell peacefully asleep in the warm, cozy bed after spending an evening by the fireplace.
We enjoyed exploring Monte Sano State Park, which is just a few minutes down the road. And it was easy to get down the mountain and into town for meals and exploring the city. That said, it was so nice at Nolen cabin, we opted to eat supper there every night and just relax by the cozy fireplace instead of going into town.
I’d also like to note that Vanessa and her husband were super friendly and helpful. Looking forward to our next visit to Huntsville! We would definitely stay at Nolen Corner again!"

The bed was very comfy and the kitchen was well stocked. Vanessa was truly a super host and responded to all my questions quickly. I will be going back.

Stayed a few nights","Incredible place! I will be coming back to their place when I want to go back for another visit in the mountains. My only suggestion is we had to get creamer and sugar for coffee, so that might be nice to have. But that’s the only flaw, and it’s even a not a big deal! Beautiful, serene, cozy, peaceful, and welcoming! I highly recommend! You’ll enjoy your stay!"

From the moment we walked in we smelt a fresh clean aroma. All of the linens smelt very clean. It felt like an old English cottage. Could not ask for a more perfect location the spend our evening.

Stayed a few nights","Vanessa’s place was perfect for our quick weekend trip! The location is AWESOME if you’re looking for something quiet, peaceful, and in nature that’s away from the bustle but just a short drive from great restaurants, coffee shops, walking trails, shopping, etc. The cabin itself is also nice. It felt quaint and cozy with all the standard amenities you’d have in a hotel room but without the ambience…streaming channels, internet, a/c, full kitchen, etc. Vanessa was also a wonderful host. She was responsive, helpful, engaging, and so accommodating. She checked on us throughout our stay to make sure we had everything we needed. I come to Huntsville frequently and will definitely plan to stay at Vanessa’s again!!"

Stayed with kids","We stayed a night in Huntsville and this was a cute, comfortable, and quiet place to stay. Everything was as described and Vanessa went over the top to make sure things were perfect for us! The bed is comfy and the living and bedroom are spacious. We didn’t need the kitchen, but it had everything. The bathroom was small, but worked fine. One thing to note-there is no AC unit in the bedroom. It is in the living room, however this wasn’t a problem for us. I usually sleep Iike a polar bear but had no issues being hot while I slept. The drive up to the place is beautiful and the neighborhood was quiet and safe. It’s about a 20 min drive from Bridge Street, where we ate, which was fine for us. Overall, a great experience and we would stay here again."

Stayed with kids","We very much enjoyed our stay. This wasn't a crowded hotel, but a nice rustic home in a mountain community in a forest near a state park. Many restaurants were within a 15 minute drive. Many cool attrctions were within a short driving distance; the U.S. Space and Rocket Center, the Huntsviĺle Botanical Gardens, the Monte Sano State Park walking trails (attractions we visited). I played in a disc golf tournament and for disc golfers there are many outstanding courses in a 30 minute radius from wheee we stayed. Most of all it was peaceful and quiet. If I had any criticisms, they would be that this is an older house and it is rustic. It was a little musty when we arrived, but once the air was moving (fans and A.C.) it was just fine. The home was nicely furnished, clean and comfortable. We are not big Airbnb people, but it was a good introduction. We had very good instructions on the whole process of arrival, check-in and check-out. Thank you, Vanessa."

Likes:
-Location
-Easy parking and check in
-Very Clean
-Private entrance
-Lots of lighting
-Awesome washer/dryer
-Safe neighborhood
-Lots of pillows
Dislikes:
-Bathroom window needs a curtain/covering for top half. It faces backyard but it makes your bathroom use not feel private.
-We encountered bugs in space. We had a wasp/hornet in bathroom and one in bedroom and some other bugs.
-Mattresses could have been better on both beds. They were old and unsupportive.
-Shower stall was confining and narrow in bathroom. Probably OK for smaller person.
-You have to step into certain areas of space you want to access. Understandable for an older building but just pointing it out for other guests."

Vanessa was proactive in making sure we had everything we could possibly need.
It was cold when we arrived, so she turned on the gas fireplace and space heaters before we got there. She ensured we were nice and toasty! The cabin is a little older and more rustic than I originally had thought, but still very comfortable. It is updated with nice furniture and art.
The bed was comfortable and all the linens/towels/ dishrags, etc. were fresh and clean. And soft! It was very helpful to have the shampoo, conditioner, hair dryer and coffee already there. We are already planning to come back this summer!"

Stayed a few nights","We needed a quick place for a four day mini vacation and wanted to stay away from hotels and loved the fact that this was in the mountains near a state park. Vanessa's place is clean and equipped with lots of linens, pillows, heaters, books, games, and kitchen stuff. Vanessa made herself available all the time, even though we never needed her.
I do have to point out that the bathroom is small and has two steps down. We were fine with it, but for my husband, who's 6'4, it was tight. Other than that it was fine, but anyone with size issues or a handicap might find it difficult.
We enejoyed our time at Vanessa's and we'd stay here again!!!"

Stayed over a week","This is a WONDERFUL spot! It's cozy but spacious. Very, very clean. Large bedroom with a very comfortable king-sized bed. Complete kitchen for cooking, and the bathroom was spotless.The fireplace is the icing on the cake, though. A welcoming and comfortable atmosphere with a rich history greets you as soon as you walk in. The entrance is very private and looks out to a woodsy lot that disguises the fact that you are a 5 minute walk to the State Park and only an 8 minute drive to the charm of downtown 5 points for any necessary shopping. If you choose to walk around, you won't find a friendlier neighborhood. Vanessa is a proactively considerate host that has anticipated your needs and is also very quickly responsive to her guests. You will add this stay to your list of return visits!"

She also provided so many little attention to personal comfort details. Nice extras like lavender pillow spray to help you rest, great quality shower products and all.
Vanessa is beyond anyone I have rented from before. We were over 6 hours late getting in because of our delayed flight and a two hour drive. She kept in contact with us, mainly to make sure we were alright! She was attentive to anything we wanted and so friendly (she literally live a few hundred feet away).
Cabin was great we just requested it for Christmas today, so that should give you an idea of how much we enjoyed Vanessa, her husband and the cabin.

Squirrel and bunny watch off the patio area, and we loved just sitting and listening to the sounds around us at night, very peaceful.
Plenty of room in the bedroom and living area for two people and their fur baby, you could easily add another person or two in the mix. There has been a lot of attention to the decor and details to make your stay here a relaxing one. Vanessa was quick to respond to any questions we had, she was so friendly when she greeted us when we arrived at the cabin.
The cabin is an easy drive down the mountain into Huntsville where you’ll run into the hospital area, Starbucks, Chick-fil-A, Publix, and a close drive to Lowe Mill arts, Botanical Garden, Space & Rocket Ctr and many other things Huntsville has to offer.
Vanessa’s cabin is definitely a place that has a history in the area and to stay there makes you want more!"

Stayed with a pet","This little house was perfect for our stay. The host prepared the residence with abundant towels, coffee with choice of creamers, and wonderfully comfortable beds. The location was super quiet and seemed close to all the places we chose to visit. The large, fenced in backyard was my dog's paradise as she got to run, sniff, and investigate."

Stayed with a pet","I stayed here while in town for training for 2 weeks. Good sized for me & my 2 dogs both weeks along with a colleague and her cat the first week. Backyard was a good size for the dogs to run around in and although there were several neighboring homes with fences, there were no other neighboring dogs to cause fence aggression. It had all the basic supplies we needed and even kept me cozy while iced in for 4 days. It’s an older, modest neighborhood that is well-kept and quiet. It met my needs very well and the host was always very responsive even as I wondered if I’d need to extend my stay due to the iced roads."

Close drive to plenty of Huntsville attractions and restaurants. Not the place to stay if you’re looking to be in the thick of nightlife or walking to restaurants/bars, or want lots of amenities, but worked perfectly for us. Clean and tidy home, and having the washer/dryer available was nice. The neighborhood is solidly working class, not particularly upscale in any way, but was quiet and seemed safe. The host was friendly, flexible and communicated quickly when needed. I’d recommend this home for a simple and affordable place to stay."

I loved the pre-check in YouTube videos that James sent our way to make it even easier to navigate and a how to use the shower. Speaking of which, the shower was perfect easily the best shower situation I have experienced.
The only downsides were I thought the bed ran a little soft and hot, so a better mattress would send this AirBnB to a top tier stay. Otherwise, I had a great time and would stay again."

Stayed with a pet","This was one of our favorite Air Bnbs! Although the neighborhood itself is not really walkable, the apartment is less than a 10 minute drive from everywhere you might want to go. James and Emily made great recommendations for food and attractions, and everything we needed was already in the apartment. It’s very quiet (we never heard the neighbors) and clean, and we appreciated the thoughtful note and bonus treats for us and our pup. We will stay here again anytime we visit Huntsville."

James was incredibly helpful and communicative during my entire stay, accommodated my need for early check in & late check out, and made finding a great place to stay with my pet a breeze.

I don’t recommend this, and James would probably not enjoy seeing this - but I did check out a few minutes late and James was very understanding.

And to make it even better they had the good toilet paper.(I brought my own, but didn’t need it as they already had the same;-) I wouldn’t change a thing.

I was absolutely obsessed with the dishwasher, which I know is a really funny thing to say. Also love the electric stove and gave me a really good idea to make my own. And don’t even get me started on that shower. Obsessed. I totally understand why it’s mentioned in so many of the reviews now. I don’t think I have ever showered before that shower. Overall, just a really clean and great place to stay."

Stayed a few nights","I would literally rent this place just to take a 15 minute shower. But aside from the gloriously fantastic shower everything about this place is perfect. From the kitchen, sitting room, bathroom, and bedroom to the little details - framed pictures of local recommendations, 2 complimentary local beers, the responsiveness of the host when we locked ourselves out (sorry ‘bout that), and the nice little welcome card.
I found myself googling tables, couches, lighting fixtures, appliances, and design ideas, so I can replicate the place in my home.
So needless to say, if you are in the Huntsville area and need a cozy place to stay (or just a 15 minute shower), stop searching Airbnb for other options and book this place if you can."

Kitchen had everything we needed to cook a fine dinner and breakfast. Bed was comfortable. Space was clean and perfectly cozy for two. Street was quiet. First time I’ve had a host provide instructional videos for entry and appliance use. They were professionally done and very helpful. We took a short Uber to a local music venue and walked back home afterwards. Would 100% stay in another one of James’ spaces. 10/10.

1. Easy to find and right down the road from the Stove House (have to go there)
2. Easy to get in (super easy)
3. Very clean
4. Awesome décor
5. Washer and dryer (really? Yep) Good ones too, not just crappy ones.
6. Full kitchen (missing a whisk and maybe get an extra small pan)
7. Big closet, lots of space
8. Nice size bedroom (probably needs a bigger bed for some, I was ok though)
9. Nice size bathroom.
Last but not least.....................
10. THE SHOWER!!! I love showers and this was the best, hands down. Full body sprayers from the front, rain and fountain from the top. Add to this a hand held piece. Coming back here for sure."

Stayed one night","Location was great, just a few minutes Uber from Orion Amphitheater which is why we were in town. Music themed decor was appropriate. One of the chairs on the balcony had a broken back making it somewhat difficult to get comfortable. My biggest complaint relates to the sleeping arrangements. We rented the unit for 3 adults with the understanding that the living room couch would pull out to accommodate the 3rd person. Fold out bed was nearly impossible to pull out of the couch. One of the fold out legs at the end of the pull out was bent at angle that prevented it from touching the ground and made the bed unusable. All 3 adult guests had to share the master bed. Also, the extra blankets and pillows mentioned in the amenities were nowhere to be found. Furthermore, no laundry or dish detergent was provided to start loads as requested in the checkout binder."

Stayed with kids","My family and I stayed in this house for a few nights while visiting Huntsville to go to the space center! The home was easy to find and looked just like the photos (yes there's mostly nude female art on the walls!). It's kind of in a weird spot in between a police station place and a business. Not a lot of outdoor privacy, but there was some curtains for the back porch if using the hot tub- which was nice! The amenities and modern decor are the big draws for this place - nicely appointed inside and kids loved the pool table and arcade game (and hot tub). The location was catty-corner from a hipster coffee shop and also near a cool artist/shops building (Lowe Mill) that are walkable! Space center was close too, less than 10 mins drive. They provide an eclectic collection of standard bath towels and washcloths but NOT hand towels (FYI). Kitchen stocked with plenty of items like plates, toaster, corkscrew, etc.... although BYO K-cups for the Keurig! Owners very responsive to questions."

So glad their parents are understanding. They needed towels and we couldn’t find them. They were in the dryer! The internet went out and I tried to contact the hosts. Instead of them responding, I got an automated message about not smoking inside the house. I messaged again hours later about the internet being out, and got a response then. Even though these few things were irritating, we would definitely stay there again. It’s very cute and very clean. It’s in a great location and is very private! The boys made memories this weekend to last a lifetime!"

Stayed with kids","The house is beautiful, when I say it’s put together very well. The location is awesome, being by the police station ensured more safety in the area. Very private area, rented for my daughter 18 birthday sleep over. Very spacious, I absolutely love the house. There was a few things i didn’t like. There’s definitely not enough kitchen material to cook with, they had a coffee maker with no coffee, we looked everywhere for napkins, which ended up being behind the trash can under the sink. We also looked everywhere for towels and wash clothes and they ended up being in the dryer! Big inconvenients! I was there with a teenager girls and the first thing we looked for was towels and wash clothes because we had a dinner at bridge street, so that was aggravating. Due to the lack of response to my questions I had I would only rent again because the house is nice. 😊 after getting messages about smoking in the house and no response to my question was a big red flag. I ensured them I read the rules"

We have a family of 5, traveling with children. We were surprised when we arrived to see 3 images on the wall (does not appear in listing photos) of a naked woman in 3 different poses. With 2 younger sons traveling with us, I found it terribly inappropriate. Perhaps this house would be better for adult travel, but I wouldn’t recommend for families. Train can be heard at night when putting kids to sleep."

Stayed with kids","My stay could have been better.when we arrived I saw that the key was in the door only
To find the cleaners still in the home . We only
Waited maybe 20 more mins before they finished cleaning. Cleaning I guess due to it being the holiday was a bite rushed . We found hair on the beds stairs and hot tub. I asked how I could change the water but I received no response . Communication was not great at all. I could got in but I won't. Airbnb has great potential but my family won't be returning."

They were great host who went above and beyond. Responded to questions quick. Not much more you can ask for in a host.

Everything was amazing down to the welcome case of beer in fridge. These two host are highly recommended.

Group trip","The place appeared spotless but there were a few discrepancies. There were missing (not out, but actually needed a lightbulb) in the primary bathroom. The towels were in the dryer still. There were NO k-cups for the keurig. Theres a silver dollar stain on the coach that was visible immediately upon arrival. Broken blinds in the primary bathroom.
The coffee shop catty-cornered was amazing! The location was great for visiting the Orion. And the owners were very responsive. It just lacked what I have come to expect in an Airbnb."
