Stayed a few nights","The house was in a good location, nearby campus with a nice walkable area. However. Upon entrance, there was a very strong, noticeable smell… of a strong wall plug in like trying to mask another unpleasant smell. It improved a bit after we opened all the windows to air it out for a while. But was not completely gone. The sheets, bedding, and towels all had visible stains, ripped, and were not completely dry.
Overall, it was an okay place to stay as the kitchen was fully stocked, had a comfortable couch and beds. It was good enough for a long weekend stay for school."

Findley was great with lots of local spots and beautiful houses for a walk about town. The hosts had very clear instructions beforehand so didn't really need to reach out to them. Remembering this location if we do ladies weekend again....which we are already talking about.

Stayed with kids","This place was even nicer than the pics. It’s obvious that the hosts care about the property and that their guests have a positive experience. The beds were comfortable, the couch was fantastic and the kitchen was nice. There are even a couple baby gates in the house that can be used which is really helpful when traveling with kids! The hosts were very communicative too, even though they’d literally just had a baby. We would definitely come back again."

Stayed a few nights","I cannot write a complete review yet because we are still in the AirBnB resolution process. The gap between the advertized cleanliness of the unit and what I experienced was big enough that I left soon after arrival for a hotel and did not spend one night in this location. More disappointing was that thus far the host has taken no responsibility for the gap I experienced. I photographed the problem and left physical evidence for the host to see. The host did take prompt action to try and demonstrate to me that the problem I saw, photogrqphed and delt with did not and does not exist. Consistent with that approach the host has thus far declined to offer any degree of refund for the 5 day booking which is why we are currently in the middle of the AirBnB resolution process."

The Pink Cabin was exactly as described and more. It was not only clean and well-maintained, but it also had a charming and cozy atmosphere. The attention to detail in the cabin's decor and amenities truly made it feel like a home away from home. I was pleasantly surprised by the thoughtfulness of the host in providing everything I needed for a comfortable stay.
Sheryl's communication was exceptional. From the moment I made the booking until the day I checked out, she was prompt in responding to my inquiries and provided all the necessary information. Her clear and detailed instructions made it easy for me to find the cabin and settle in without any hassle. I would highly recommend the pink cabin to anyone."

The fridge is stocked with many common condiments and the cupboards had several common baking/cooking items. It is nice that each bedroom has a tv allowing people to watch desired programs. The backyard seemed like a work in progress so I can’t wait to see what Sheryl does with it! The house is easy access off the interstate and very close to restaurants.

Stayed a few nights","we had an absolutely lovely time at this slice of heaven! It was a getaway for the mums/ladies! the fridge was pleasantly stocked with the main basics No need to buy picnic size bottles of condiments! The beds are huge and comfy but firm memory foam. The living room while comfy we felt more cozy hanging in the plant bedroom, more so due to the low seating of the couch (us ol gals struggle with the knees lol). The Icing on the cake though was the hot tub / patio 🙌🏽 the chill peaceful, relaxing atmosphere She's created in the back is stunning. that is an oasis and honestly there was no need to leave the yard. Sheryl was a kind and generous host and there if we needed her communication: Flawless, I love that Sheryl gave us all the details then left us to enjoy the space and even reached out to ask us if we'd like a later check out, like what!! it was just what we needed, LOVED our stay! would absolutely recommend, I would live here if I could🤍"

Group trip","We had a great experience at The Pink Cabin! Sheryl was a perfect hostess- checking in to make sure everything was going well. Beds and rooms were exactly as described. Kitchen area, while smallish, was fully stocked with pots, pans, and cooking utensils. It was perfect for cooking nightly meals. The washer and dryer were easily accessible. Each room has its own separate TV which made it nice to separate when divided on what to watch. Games were available. A Kuerig coffee pot and traditional coffee pot were available. It was mentioned in another comment but just a heads up- the beds and couch are both low to the ground. All were SUPER comfortable so not an issue just lowish so keep in mind if you’re trying to sit your 95 year old grandma on the couch 🤣. Due to the freezing cold temperatures, we didn’t use the hot-tub but it looks wonderful. Easy access off of I75 and easy to navigate to restaurants near by. The neighborhood was quiet. Would stay at again!"

Stayed with kids","More spacious than you would predict from the outside, the Pink Cabin is a great house for a bigger group. We had 5 adults and 2 kids and were totally comfortable in the house. The first floor allows for gathering all together and that includes the kitchen. There is no big kitchen table which didn't matter for us as we were not eating dinner there, but there is an ample coffee table in the great room and a counter area in the kitchen with stools. The house was clean, well appointed and in a quiet area. Only one of our group used the outdoor hot tub, but he said it was fine. All the beds were comfy. Big (and new) refrigerator/freezer and washer/dryer. The host was great with communication and readily available."

Oh and I can’t forget the Christmas tree! It was such a heart warming touch. I would highly recommend staying here if you’re in town for a few days. I don’t think you’ll regret it.

The water pressure was good for showers and having laundry on site was a big plus. The driveway offers plenty of parking for multiple vehicles as we had four at once. The neighborhood is walkable but you need to watch for uneven sidewalk like many older, established neighborhoods. Her home is easy access from I-75 and just a few minutes to a commercial area that includes Walmart. We especially appreciated her coffee bar! Sheryl’s hospitality was appreciated."

Stayed a few nights","This is a wonderfully decorated house with a private driveway. It has a fully functioning kitchen with a smart refrigerator and smart washer and dryer. It has a spacious hot tub in the back. Self entry lock and plenty of towels and small snacks. It has two full bathrooms for large bedrooms and electric fireplace that’s beautiful in the living room and it’s decorated with all kinds of positive inspirational sayings and colors to help you relax. The neighborhood is quiet and very very safe it’s right near the high school, Walmart, and other amenities. The owners are super communicative and have their personal cell phone number posted inside the home should you need anything. It’s a great place to stay and if I have to travel that way again I will definitely stay in that property."

The hot tub was definitely a bonus, but we would have stayed here just for the adorable decor! Just a few minutes away from major stores and restaurants. The host was also very friendly and responsive. She even sent us some suggestions for restaurants and bars in the area! Would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed one night","This house was super clean and we loooooooved the (clean and set to 104!) hot tub. The beds are VERY comfy. There are tons of towels (all sizes including beachtowels). The kitchen has all kinds of pots/pans/dishes/utensils/appliances (air fryer, Kuerig, etc.). There were some condiments in the fridge, some ice cream in the freezer, and spices, olive oil, salt, pepper, Ramen noodles, etc. in the kitchen. There are basic toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, pads, and tampons) available and a hair dryer in each bathroom. The large TVs, comfy beds, and comfy couch were definitely appreciated. The wifi info was readily available and connectivity was great. There were some board/card games available. There are some (but not tons of) food delivery options (we used Doordash). Communication with the host was great and keypad entry was simple.
The area (Findlay) isn't exactly picturesque, but when you're in this home, it really doesn't matter. I'd definitely book another stay."

I know other reviews mentioned the low profile furniture, and tho it wouldn’t be my first choice since I’m 5’11” and my man is 6’2”, I will say that we didn’t have a problem with it. Sheryl was a wonderful host, excellent communication and so accommodating!!!

Stayed a few nights","keep in mind if you are taller than 5'6"" you may struggle a bit with the couch and some of the beds.
the exterior of the house is questionable as other reviewers have noted but the renovations to the interior are quite nice.
There is a Keurig pod coffee maker.
The backyard is dark at night so when we used the bbq we had to use our flashlights.
One suggestion to the owner that I forgot to mention would be to add some racks in the bathroom to dry towels."

Stayed a few nights","Just what I was looking for during this trip - basically a place to sleep while visiting relatives. It was clean, comfortable, and very quiet. There was nothing lacking in the kitchen or bathroom for a complete stay, and the bed was very comfortable. I liked that the dwelling was its own little cottage. It was set well back off the street and behind the main house so any traffic noise was basically unheard. I greatly appreciated the small cement turn-around on the edge of the driveway so I didn't have to back out onto the busy street. Orion was very responsive - within minutes - to my questions and to a clarification an item in his initial instructions. I would love to stay here again when I'm in the area."

Stayed a few nights","Orion’s offering at Mainstay is a pleasant contemporary studio style getaway with a homey and cozy feel.
The interior space has been utilized well and gives a larger than presumed feel. Although more of a studio layout, with the bed/living/dining/kitchen sharing one elongated room, the choices of furniture and placement disabuse any travelers of claustrophobic feelings. The fixtures and appliances are modern and yet there is an older comfort to the space. Functional yet warm and inviting.
The renovated bathroom is delightful and offset from the primary space, further enhancing the perception of interior size and adding an element of privacy. There are plenty of space for luggage and clothes. Parking is ample, but pay attention to guidance provided so all vehicles are accommodated. The back porch and fire pit only add to the ambiance of the wonderful destination that is “Mainstay”."

My only negative comment was that the rental had a slight smell to it (like it hadn’t been used in a while - maybe it just needed to be aired out?) and the air conditioner was a little loud.
Other than that, it was a nice stay."

Stayed a few nights","The Mainstay is a cozy little studio. We made use of the fire pit, and the backyard area was a very comfortable space. Super nice shower, bidet, plenty of clean and fresh towels. The air-conditioner does make a slight noise that can make it difficult to sleep if you're a light sleeper but nothing crazy. We made use of the kitchen and dishwasher, and there were plenty of utensils, cookware, etc. Lots of tea and coffee to choose from. No liquid or powdered creamer though, which would have been a welcome addition. Overall very comfortable stay would definitely visit again if in the area.
PS There is a troupe of about 7 baby cats as of this review that are a cute addition. A little skittish, but fun to have around."

It had everything I needed, including lots of hot water, nice shower, extremely nice towels and wonderful coffee bar and kitchen with supplies. If you like an EXTRA firm mattress, you'll love this place (My back doesn't like firm, but that's not their fault). I recommend. Orion made the entire experience very pleasant at a great price."

Stayed a few nights",The inside was clean and had sufficient supplies. Orion was very responsive with communication which was all done through texting. The place was very quiet at night. GPS does take you to the State Patrols instead of the correct driveway. He did explain this in the app. We arrived after dark so it was more difficult to find where we needed to go and dark. Trees and shrubs were overgrown which made it harder to see in the dark. The sidewalk that leads you around back to your cottage is very uneven and you needed to really watch where you were walking so you wouldn't trip on the sidewalk. Price was very reasonable for our stay.

Judy's place was very quite and the room was dark with blackout curtains on the window. Her house is a few blocks south of downtown so good restaurants are a quick drive away or a long walk. Judy and her 2 dogs were very friendly. I'll look to stay at Judy's place the next time I'm in Findlay for work.

Both the eggs and mint were delicious and plentiful. His generosity showed and we appreciated it.

But we're giving the benefit of the doubt because, as we discovered later, there may have been a communication issue with AirBnB. However, Carla was there when we arrived and all worked out well. We were pleased with the size of the lower level of the home. The kitchen, living room, and dining space were great. We were able to host our family of ten around the large dining table, though we did supply a few extra folding chairs of our own. The bathroom was small but functional. The bed was comfortable. The heat was difficult to regulate, especially for the upper floor. We would return."

Stayed a few nights",We loved our stay with Foad and Carla! The inside was beautifully decorated with plenty of room to gather. The kitchen had everything that we needed and more. Was pleasantly surprised by the lovely bread and fruit left for us as well as the offer of fresh eggs for breakfast. The shared outdoor space was delightful and such a so pleasant with the fire pit and multiple seating spaces. We have stayed at Airbnb places all across the states and even internationally and Foad and Carla were by far the most welcoming and gracious hosts that we have ever encountered. They truly made us feel at home.

Stayed one night","Incredible hospitality -- much more like a regular B&B than the usual Airbnb.
When I arrived, the host met me at the curb to show me where I could park, give me the code for the front door, and show me around the rental side of the duplex. (The hosts live on the other side.) The backyard is shared and has plenty of comfortable seating, a fire ring, lighting and music at night, and even fresh eggs from the chickens! I was supposed to be traveling with family, but I found myself traveling alone. The hosts truly did entertain me (again, more like a traditional B&B), making sure that I was comfortable and well cared for and spending an evening in pleasant conversation. In addition to a comfortable stay, I had a very enjoyable visit.
If you are interested in cooking for yourself, the kitchen is stocked with many small appliances; cooking would be very comfortable here. The washer and dryer are also easily accessible. It's a great place for a longer stay."

Stayed a few nights","We had originally booked a hotel when coming to visit my sister for the weekend. Findlay is my hometown and the more I thought about it, the more it didn’t feel right to stay in a generic hotel. I started looking for a spot close by and was thrilled to find Angel’s place on the same street my sister lives! The neighborhood is quiet and lined with gorgeous old trees. The house felt like home to me. It is an older home that just made you feel comfortable right away when you walked in. We were in very short walking distance to see my sister and also a very quick drive to the heart of downtown Findlay! We could have walked to downtown if we had wanted to. We had everything we needed and enjoyed our stay very much. I am so excited to have such a great place to stay when I visit again! I hope to stay many more times."

Stayed a few nights","If you love the charm of older homes you will live this place! There is nothing cookie cutter about this home. Gorgeous real wood floors, beautiful brick fireplace (gas), relaxing tub with jets and a great shower head. I fell in love the updated bright kitchen with everything you need. Comfortable living room furniture and the bed is just right as Goldie Locks said. Nice size backyard which my dogs loved to run around in. And whoever painted the inside attention to detail was just fabulous. Check out the half bath on the main floor - the striping is perfect. You will feel right at home as soon as you walk in. I didn’t get to explore the neighborhood but it was beautiful and looked very walkable. Across the street there is a green space with trees and a picnic table which I wish I had time to sit at to watch the squirrels running about getting ready for winter. Next time definitely will take time to do that and walk the neighborhood. It was a perfect relaxing stay."

Stayed with a pet","Our 1st stay at Airbnb. Location was perfect for our needs. Great place to have our dog. House has great ‘old’ bones with updates that are nice. It does have an upstairs bedroom… However (18 easy steps) it’s not a steep climb…like in most older homes. Not sure the upstairs has A/C … or it’s my bad (my ? operator thermostat error). The home is clean but not up to my standards. It needs TLC. It’s in no way uncomfortable dirty… There isn’t regular TV…just free streaming. New to me but was ok. Overall I would really recommend staying here…it has many many more plus factors than negative & I would gladly stay again.
Thanks Angel for an enjoyable stay."

Stayed with a pet","All was as advertised. GREAT location. Minutes from university of Findlay and even closer to downtown. Angel was SUPER sweet. Bed was very comfortable. Couches were comfy too. Roomy! Very welcoming for our dogs. They were so happy to be with us. Nice area, many routes to go for walks.
I’m sorry to say though that the house needs a head to toe scrubbing. It’s not close to ‘hotel’ clean. Dust, doorways, all flooring, kitchen appliances all need deep cleaning attention. All sinks and toilets were clean. Bedding/linens were clean.
Home was old and showed it’s age but well worth the low per night cost though. Overall my daughter and I enjoyed our stay and would consider again now that we know what to expect."

Stayed with kids","It was ok. It definitely felt like this was one in a bunch of places managed by owner. Airbnb was downstairs as well. We thought this was also their home, it wasn’t.
We had a broken back door knob that fell off when we touched it and I fixed it because they couldn’t come out to replace it. It wasn’t secure and we felt a little uncomfortable about it.
Everything was very clean but all items felt a bit cheep and not a higher quality. Definitely felt like it was one among many.
It was fine, we would stay again but would try to find something a bit more next time.
Communication was fast and kind."

Stayed one night","This unit was exactly as described, except somehow even better. It was full of thoughtful touches and so many ways to make everything perfect for every guest, like a variety of lighting and dimmers in each room, heating and AC along with ceiling fans, even the salt lamp on the bedroom desk provided the perfect gentle glow without any disturbing brightness. I am a very clean person and always notice things like dusty doors, baseboards, blinds, dirty cabinets, etc. I have often cleaned an airbnb upon checking in, before being able to sit down and really relax. This place was spotless and clean in and perfect shape already, I didn’t feel the need to do a single thing except relax and nap in the papasan chair. I drink a ton of water and really appreciated the filtered pitcher in the fridge. The sofa was comfy as was the bed and even the blanket and pillows smelled fresh and clean. Really enjoyed my stay. With their pull out sofa bed, it even would have worked for my family of 4. Thank you!"

Stayed with kids","Perfect airbnb for my daughter and I. We needed a place to stay for one night while we were in town for a soccer tournament. Helen’s place was 5 minutes away from the fields at Emory Adams park so it was perfect for a very very early game and the check out being at 11, we were able to come back to the airbnb and rest before the last game.
The place is very confortable, even cuter in person than in the pictures. There are heaters and AC units, and despite being there at the end of April, we had to put the heat on and it was very effective. The place was also very clean, there’s everything you need, there was coffee and tea for our morning breakfast. Also you park right in front of the house and you can self check in and out.
Also if you read previous review, about the place being bright and sunny in the morning, which I loved, there are curtains that you can use if you prefer to keep it dark.
If I were to come back to Findlay, I would stay here again. No hesitation."

It was a perfect place for us to spend the night, and Helen was very flexible with our arrival time, which ended up being later than we thought it would be. Definitely five stars."

I noticed there were a couple sauces in the fridge, and being the owner of a barrel aged sauce company, I decided I'd leave a bottle of BBQ and hot sauce from Private Barrel Company.

The place is definitely worth the value. I cannot comment on Helen’s responsiveness during our stay because the information she provided in advance made everything go smoothly. Therefore, I had no need to reach out to her while visiting. Overall, I give my highest recommendation for this location to anyone visiting Findlay! Thanks Helen and Tyler!!!!"

Stayed with kids","Our family enjoyed staying at Tyler and Helen’s home. It felt like a home away from home. It was decorated and furnished thoughtfully, with attention to floors, windows, mirrors and fixtures which were dusted and cleaned well. They were very responsive and quick to answer our many questions as we prepared for the trip and during our trip. They had great recommendations as well as accommodations for us. They were thoughtful in planning for our toddler being with us and accommodated the flexibility needed to adapt things to a busy toddler.
Tyler and Helen worked well together to communicate with us and assure a pleasant stay, even coming before bedtime to make sure we felt comfortable with a question we had. The products used for cleaning, soaps, and toiletries were of great quality and we both talked about how fancy we felt using such nice smelling and better quality products. It was well stocked and the amenities were a sweet touch to make us feel at home. The parking was really close to the door, and well lit for night time arrivals. The kitchen was well stocked with new cookware and dishes. There are just a few minor things that could make it an even better visit, but nothing too big or impactful in deciding to stay there.
We really enjoyed our stay and feel like if we are back in the area, we know where we would go to feel taken care of while away from home."

The owners were super sweet, had great communication, and were available if I needed anything during my stay.
I was only intown for one night, but if I'm ever back in the area, I'm definitely staying here again!
I highly recommend this place to anyone traveling alone (or in a small group) looking for a cute, cozy place in Findlay."

We didn't need the washer and dryer, but if we were to stay longer next time, that would be very nice to have right in the space. Easy to find and within 10-12 minutes of all the hotspots of Findlay. We would definitely stay again. Thank you so much for the stay, Jillian!!"

Stayed a few nights","I’ve stayed in a couple Airbnb’s in Findlay and I’m from there so I know what apartments can be like. This this one was BY FAR the best Air B&B I’ve been to there! It was SPOTLESS when I walked in, I am usually sensitive to fragrance in scented fabric softeners, and even though I could tell some were used it was so light and pleasant it didn’t bother me at all! I actually enjoyed it, and the place was very cozy and quiet… I could park my car right outside the door to get in… also it cost MUCH less than the other ones that I have stayed at. It was perfect for what I needed! I would highly recommend it for a quiet getaway. I slept great there 😊 This was a rare find in every way. I’ve already told other family members about it for when they visit. 😊❤️ I really hope it’s available next time I go “home”."

The living space was comfortable and inviting and allowed for entertainment, studying or sleeping - whatever we chose. Extra pillows, blankets, the closets had hangers and other small touches made it feel like home. A great place to stay at when visiting the local breweries, your UF student and close to other attractions."

One of my sisters claimed the nook under the stairs for her bed/reading spot. Bathrooms very nicely decorated. Especially enjoyed the decorated staircase. The home was clean and the living room seating was comfortable. We liked there was a front and back door--well-lit with a security light system.
We had trouble getting in the back door with the keypad--we couldn't seem to coordinate the keypad with the deadbolt. Someone quickly showed up to show us what to do.
One suggestion--the dining room table was sized for four people with four chairs--and the light above that table was somewhat dim.
We did have a great time; everyone agreed that we would stay at this AirBnB again."

Stayed over a week","If you're staying in Findlay, OH, this is a great place to stay as it's walkable to downtown restaurants/bars and shops, a grocery store, and car rental. Our favorite local spots: Wilson's, Dietsch (for ice cream), Main St. Deli (soup and sandwich w/ bar and arcade, Bourbon Affair, Alexandria's (play a bowling game while there), among others.
The house is well stocked, lots of cozy blankets for winter, and very clean. Elizabeth is a fantastic host. Overall, one of the best Airbnb spots we've stayed at and will continue to be our go-to when we visit family in the area."

The kitchen is fully stocked with everything you need to make solid homemade meals.
The bathrooms and showers had soaps, body washes, etc.
But the best part was the living room. It was so cozy and I spent most of my time tucked into the little ""reading nook"" under the staircase. I did lots of reading!
I was so grateful to find this place on short notice so I could have some quiet space and time to recover."

Stayed with kids","We absolutely loved Elizabeth's place! We stayed 4 nights while moving our daughter in to the University of Findlay. This place is beautiful inside and out, very well kept and clean. It's super close to downtown, but still quite quiet. The home is cozy, but also felt spacious for my family - hubby and I had our 3 sons with us, plus occasionally the daughter we were moving in to college. There are several places to sit and relax; the backyard has table and chairs and was so peaceful. The sleeping area in the reading nook was a hit with my little boys, who alternated turns sleeping there. The beds were super comfy. We did a combination of cooking in and eating out - the kitchen is well stocked and Elizabeth even had a variety of snacks available. We were able to walk to dinner, walk to breakfast, and walk for ice cream. All were about 5 minute walks so the location is perfect for its proximity to downtown. And it was about a 5 minute drive to the university. Communication with Elizabeth was excellent and she even suggested some activities for the weekend. This is the best Airbnb we have stayed at and we will definitely stay here again since my daughter is just beginning her college journey. I highly recommend it!"

Elizabeth is a superior communicator. Very, very responsive before and during our stay.
The pictures accurately reflect the property and there were no surprises. The place was very clean and very well presented. Many small touches that indicated Elizabeth has given considerable thought to how the property is presented and how it works. Cold water bottles in the fridge, many kinds of soaps/shampoos, plenty of nice towels, snacks, and on and on.
Great location to walk to activities in downtown Findlay. In particular, it is only 2 blocks away from Dietch's which has the best ice cream you will ever have (big scoops too).
Good place for two couples or a small family.
Excellent stay start to finish. Highly recommended."

From all the nooks and crannies little and big children can curl up in, to dryer balls ready in the dryer, Elizabeth's home has it all.
It is really easy to get to. Parking in the front and private parking in the back. Nightlights for in the middle of the night bathroom visits. Very comfy beds. Plenty of spaces for hanging and folding clothes. Uno cards, Tonka trucks, books and my favorite, Boggle, to challenge bored children. A kitchen loaded with all the tools for cooking a full blown meal. A loft perfect for a bit of private time without shutting yourself off completely. I couldn't have asked for more.
We are a family of five and it fit us nicely. We were there to see our oldest son graduate from a nearby college but if we ever decide to visit Findlay again, this would be our pick.
We are very grateful for our time here."

She has thought of absolutely everything, from everything you could ever dream of needing in the kitchen, to every toiletry that exists, to motion sensor nightlights, to sippy cups and pack-n-plays.
The reading nook and cool upstairs bedroom suite are wonderful. The location a block from main street and downtown was excellent.
Elizabeth is a great host and when I absent mindedly left all of my business clothes hanging in her closet, she worked with us in arranging for a friend who lives in town to pick the clothes up from her.

Stayed a few nights",I have stayed with Elizabeth several times. She is an amazing host. All Airbnb hosts should have some lessons from Elizabeth.

Stayed a few nights","Elizabeth provids an absolutely lovely space! Everything was very cozy and comfy. The loft bedroom was a great place to retreat to at the end of the night and the reading nook was a fabulous space to cozy up and read for hours.
I booked very last minute for a spur of the moment trip and I am so glad I found this place! I will definitely be trying to me back!"

Stayed a few nights","Elizabeth's little blue home away from home is cozy, comfortable, and welcoming. Sparkling clean! It is close to everything downtown. Lots of great restaurants that do takeout in this time of Covid. And a small grocery store just two blocks away. Elizabeth's attention to details like snacks, toiletries, charging stations for electronics, and sensor lights in the bathrooms make it even better. Her decorating is lovely, too. We would definitely stay there again."

Stayed over a week","Elizabeth’s home is adorable! It is decorated very nicely and exudes a comfy ambiance. There are a lot of extra touches you do not normally see in an Airbnb. Also, Elizabeth is very happy to help you in anyway and very attentive to an email. If it wasn’t Covid the location would be awesome, it is near restaurants and stores. We stayed two weeks and were very happy!"

Stayed about a week","Our stay at ""Be Our Guest"" was absolutely perfect! We stayed for 7 nights over the Christmas holiday, and loved every minute of it. It was a fantastic space for us to work during the day, close enough to visit nearby family in the evenings for the holidays, and then such a cozy place to return home to every night! Elizabeth's place had everything we could possibly need, and had wonderful touches throughout. We loved all of the Christmas decorations, the loft area was super neat and stylish, the living room was incredibly comfortable, and the kitchen was really well stocked. (The washer and dryer were very much appreciated too!) The entire space was really thoughtfully laid out, and super sparkling clean and lovely! We felt incredibly comfortable and welcomed, and really loved our stay there. We are so happy we found it and hope to return again!"

Stayed over a week","Clean, stylish, comfortable, and well located near restaurants and other things Findlay has to offer, we heartily recommend considering staying here. We definitely will be back in Findlay and plan to stay here again. Elizabeth was on top of the game whenever there was a question or need for assistance. The house was extremely well stocked with cleaning supplies and other courtesies. We could tell that Elizabeth had thought many things through, with details that we haven’t seen in other Airbnb locations."

Stayed with kids","Our stay at Elizabeth's place was nothing short of amazing! I am always nervous to book a new place that doesn't have many reviews yet, but in this case, I am so glad I did. I stayed with my best friend who was getting married and the rest of the bridal party. Elizabeth not only allowed us to have a late check-out on Saturday to give us plenty of time to get ready for the wedding, but she also left some ""Congratulations"" treats for the Bridal Party to enjoy! She was also super quick to respond and readily available. We loved the space as soon as we walked in, and even though it was on the smaller side for a group our size, we felt like we had so much room to spread out and plenty of comfy spots to sleep for every single person. I have stayed in several Airbnbs, but I honestly think this was my best experience yet -- and I don't say that lightly. :) One of the most important aspects I look for in an Airbnb is the cleanliness, and this space was so clean that I felt like I could relax as if I was in my own home. The house was also SO well decorated and very stylish. Overall, if you're hesitant to book, don't be!! Elizabeth's place is well worth it, and you won't regret staying here!"

Stayed a few nights","A true diamond in the rough. They are in the process of renewing the house. 90% of the house is just fine. You couldn't ask for a safer neighborhood. Plenty of room for a family of 4. But only one bed. The living room, kitchen, bathrooms(one with jacuzzi tub) are all great. Just needs a little TLC at the back of the house. Overall it's a good value. I would absolutely stay again."
