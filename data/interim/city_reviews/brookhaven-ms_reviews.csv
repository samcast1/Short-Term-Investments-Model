Stayed with kids","Fadwa's home was located a little over halfway on our drive back from vacation. We have a few toddlers and a baby and we wanted to give the kids a break from a long drive. Her home provided a needed break and was very accommodating for their age. She went out of her way to leave us toys and books as well as a pack and play and baby bath. Due to some very minor toilet issues (the tank was filling up slowly and we were worried something was wrong) we were able to meet her in person. She is incredibly sweet and came over immediately to check the toilet. The stay was peaceful and her home was decorated beautifully. We only stayed one night, so I cannot speak for a long duration of time or many local amenities, but we enjoyed it greatly."

Stayed a few nights","The stay was great once you got past not having a television to watch 😂 . Only other issue that I had, I was unable to use the internet WiFi, to work the connection was very slow and poor. The funniest part about the stay was the neighborhood kids playing outside, other then that it was very peaceful and quiet. Even was able to sit on the porch, only if the mosquitoes could stop😂."

Stayed with kids","This Airbnb served its purpose. The attention to detail throughout was remarkable. There was a special touch within each room and spacious for our group. We were back in town for a family reunion and was in prime location to get everywhere. Fadwa was very helpful and responsive. My nephew complained about there being no TV, but that made it all the better. This special highlight allowed us all to be more engaging with each other and spend quality time together.
There was a lovely patio to soak up the beautiful surrounding and simply relax. I wholeheartedly recommend this AirBNB if you’re in Brookhaven."

Stayed with kids","The Haven was the perfect home-away-from-home for my family while we were visiting family in Brookhaven! The home was clean and as described, plus a few items that Fadwa was gratious enough to bring for my 3-year old son.
Location-wise it couldn’t have been better: quick access to the highway and the boulevard, and I could easily take morning runs through downtown. Although the home is close to the highway, we did not notice any noise from it at night.
I know we’ll be back in Brookhaven to visit family again, and The Haven will be the first place we look as a place to stay."

Not sure if that was noted in the listing or not, we may have missed that part! All in all, a great stay if you’re looking for a bit more space than a hotel!"

The apartment is above a garage type thing & shares a driveway with neighboring residents.(they don’t bother you at all!) the area looks exactly like the pictures ! It’s extremely cozy & she has so many goodies for you. The whole place has little cute items that are just so thoughtful! The ONLY thing I will say may be a trouble for some but was great for me was that the shower is a hand held hose & there is no curtain. ( it was beneficial with a kid !

So friendly and flexible and responded quickly everytime. Even provided his cell if we needed anything. We had great snacks he provided in the kitchen and tons of cold bottled drinks. Plenty of towels and everything was super clean and comfortable. He went above and beyond for us. Possibly the nicest host we have ever had. We will for sure stay here again and rec it for anyone wanted a cool, loft/downtown vibe, complete with exposed brick and very open common space for a great price/value!"

Stayed a few nights","I would definitely stay here again. Yes, the trains go right by the airbnb, and they are indeed loud, but I actually loved that aspect of my stay and enjoyed hearing the horns and the ""click clacks"" as they rolled through town. The bed I slept in was very comfy and the sheets were nice. The bathroom and shower look ""old school,"" but everything functioned great and I liked the shower and water pressure. The fridge was well-stocked, which was appreciated. The space is massive and the ceilings are high, so there's definitely a spacious feel to the apartment -- the building is from 1905! John and Kelly were very responsive and a pleasure to communicate with."

It was such a fun experience to stay in a downtown building, but beware there are trains running throughout the night. However, the hosts were so thoughtful & left earplugs and sound machines in the bedrooms. Be sure to walk the downtown square and check out the military museum, shops, coffee shops and restaurants….And do not forget to take a picture sitting in the big blue chair!"

The 3 sets of stairs is really not bad at all as well as the train that goes by from time to time. My wife and I loved staying here and we definitely recommend it cause it's right in the middle of town. Also has the top Pizza spot right underneath the loft.
Thanks again for the Hospitality. 🙂"

Jay and Kelly were super helpful regarding things to do in Brookhaven. They truly helped us get the lay of the land prior to arriving and did not discourage any questions. Check in was simple. Jay meets you and walks you up.

Beds were comfortable and plenty of TV options. Shower had plenty of hot water and pressure. Breakfast food was a nice touch! Pizza place downstairs was good and a bakery just down the block. Nearby train wasn’t bad. Latest one I heard was around 11 one night, but some nights I don’t think there were any. Lots of windows made the place bright and cheery."

We were in town visiting family, and were so happy to find this large space that would accommodate our dog. The dog loved the huge indoor open space (so did we!) and there was plenty of green space nearby for dog-walking in this adorable town. The space is within walking distance of several good restaurants. It is also quite near the train track - but the regular trains didn't bother us. We appreciated the white noise machine provided (just like ours at home!). The amount of snacks and breakfast food provided was a happy surprise for us. Though we were there for a Thanksgiving dinner at grandmother's, it was nice to have a little something for breakfast and something to munch on later in the evening. We liked this space so much that we plan to return at Christmastime!"

The location is excellent, near several fine eating establishments. The beds are comfortable and the facilities-furnishings satisfactory (a pot would be nice and an improved coffee maker other than a Keurig). The only drawback is the noise created by trains roaring through town close by, but ear plugs helped solve this minor matter. We stayed for a week and this apartment worked very well for us. We would definitely stay there again. Overall, it was a very rewarding experience, our first Airbnb adventure, and, hopefully, the first of many to come."

He and his family greeted us and we had a nice chat about the building and the area including the fact that one can catch the train headed to New Orleans right outside! The space was clean, kitchen well stocked and amenities as described. Highly recommended."

Stayed with a pet","We took a mini break over the weekend to The Haven with a group of girlfriends and our kids. We had a wonderful time. The property is easy to find, Rachel makes sure to give detailed instructions. I would suggest having a 4 wheel drive to get up the hill. My sedan was struggling with the incline and the gravel. But we made it! The cabin is HUGE. There are plenty of places to sit and hang out without feeling like you’re cramped together. I loved the kitchen with all of the windows looking into the forest. The windows are screened so you can open them up in the morning and listen to the wind blowing through the trees while sipping coffee. It was so peaceful. Speaking of coffee, there was a pot, filters, coffee and sugar there if we needed it. We had our own but I found it so thoughtful for her to leave some for the next guest. You’ll find little touches like that all over the house. There are board games and ping pong and of course the swimming pool! The kids loved it, we loved it."

Stayed with kids","everything was great but dust on many shelves and the master bedroom had spider webs above us and the master restroom needs extensive remodeling, the shower dates back to the early 1900's but it was ok lots of caulking all around the wood shower and the shower was disconnected from one wall and then left there then another old shower head driven thru the other wall but it worked, beds were great in the master room, kitchen and entry way very disorganized with old towels tools open shelves very messy but it worked, the outside of the house very messy with weeds everywhere and roots springing up all over the place but it worked, we would like to go back if they take care of these things"

We were able to sit and have meals together as a family at one table. That's hard to do when you have a big family. We played games and watched movies together. Some of us enjoyed a nice hike in the woods while the rest of us stayed at the house and played pool. We enjoyed the pool area as well. Wi-Fi is available there but even the teenagers were having such a great time that they let their PHONES die! They're All ready to go back. They want to make this a yearly trip."

Group trip","We stayed at “The Haven” 8/9/23-8/13/23. We were in town from Illinois for a family event nearby. Five of us stayed there. We enjoyed it very much. You are very secluded and private. The home is very big. Lots of room for everyone to wander. Loved the big table in the kitchen for meals and playing cards, dominoes, etc. We were there during an extreme heat wave temps at 100 every day & heat indexes to 115. The air conditioning kept up with it and kept us comfortable. We swam one evening in the pool and really enjoyed that. Due to the extreme heat, and the possibility of ticks, poison ivy, and snakes, we did not roam the property at all. In Wesson we ate at the 51 Diner and Dumps BBQ. We recommend both for a meal. Also if you’re into antiques and collectibles the Mill Town Antique Mall in Wesson is a must. On a free day we went and explored Natchez and we really loved that old historic town with its awesome antebellum homes and mansions. Thanks for sharing this unique property with us."

Lots of seating, lots of beds for everyone. Large kitchen area and enough amenities to be able to cook whatever you wish. Rachel thought of everything. We lacked for nothing. Highly recommend. Walmart and the town is about 15 minutes if you need anything, but the house is very peaceful and quiet."

Stayed over a week","We loved our stay at The Haven! It is so private and peaceful. The pool was lovely. The cabin is even more beautiful, and much more spacious, than the pictures indicate. Fridge & kitchen (the whole house really) was all well stocked, there were tons of towels, etc.
Rachel was extremely responsive and helpful. Great communication.
The owners stay here now and again, which in my opinion changes a lot for the better. I've stayed in a lot of Air BnBs that have like 4 cups, 2 towels, and are built super cheaply. This place has all the things you need, including decent kitchen supplies - a nice treat!
Pool table / ping pong table / air hockey / books / DVDs were all fun to have. We are considering coming back in the fall when we can take better advantage of the gorgeous deck.
Thank you Rachel!"

There is so much to keep you entertained, hiking, the pool, ping pong, air hockey, and pool table, we never ran out of activities. Sitting on the porch with a morning coffee looking out into the woods and watching the birds was such a treat. The design of the house is so cool with the huge double wall of windows and large loft balcony in the great room. I also enjoyed the wooden shower with stone floor. The kitchen was well stocked with equipment for cooking our meals. What a unique gem, we hope to come back and bring our friends!"

We loved our stay and are thinking we might plan another visit during happier times. It also rained the entire time, but the place was so large and spacious that we didn’t feel on top of each other while having to be cooped up inside. The pool table and air hockey provided some distraction as well as the board games. Highly recommend this place for you and your family!"

Stayed with kids","This is a really cool house that's not far from ""downtown"" Wesson, but feels very rural. There was plenty of space for our group of six adults, three kids, and a dog. The great room is absolutely *massive*, and includes two comfy recliners, a shelf of books and games, and a great DVD collection. The kitchen is well equipped (though note that we didn't find food storage containers or Ziploc bags, so you may want to get some if you think you'll need that) and big enough for 10 or 12 people to dine in. The game room upstairs, including a pool table, Ping-Pong tabletop, and air hockey table, was absolutely the highlight for our kids. Our bed, in the master wing, was very comfortable, and the shower provided hot water and great pressure.
Outside, you can stroll in the quiet woods on the property or read in a chair on the porch, and there's a swing set, slide, and toy trucks for kids.
Rachel provided very thorough instructions on where to find everything, and was super communicative throughout. Overall, this was a great stay, especially if you're traveling with kids. We would definitely return."

Very secluded, which that is what we were looking for with all this Covid going around, we wanted a secluded immediate family weekend getaway...and that is exactly what we got. We enjoyed hiking the trails on the ""back 40"" :) and watching the local deer and squirrels pilfer along peacefully. It was the break that we needed from our busy daily lives. There is something to be said about just forgetting what time it is and all the technology (although the wifi was available), and just living in the moment. My husband and I, both mid 30's, actually enjoyed sitting down and focusing on a 750 piece Disney puzzle and just forgetting about everything else. Very relaxing and refreshing. Being a country girl myself, and moving to New Orleans 15 years ago, I had forgotten the joys of living close to an active railroad track haha. All in all, wonderful trip!"

With kids in tow we booked Anita’s place late in the evening as we were pulling into town because we were too tired to keep going. She was ready for us right away and made sure we made it safe & sound!! Her southern hospitality is unmatched!! We’ve never had a host so lovely & welcoming!!
After a wonderful night of sleep, we snuck out early and Ms. Anita handled check-out procedures for us! She even made sure we made it down the road to our final destination safely.
Planned or unplanned, we definitely recommend staying with or at any of Anita’s places!!!"

Her attention to detail is remarkable, and the unit was spotless. The location is close to everything, but pleasantly secluded. We so enjoyed walking around the lovely pond, and she made the golf cart available to us our entire stay. If you are considering her rental, look no further. It will exceed your expectations.

I don't think I've ever seen such a cute retro space. The decorations are so cute and well done. Anita is quite the host. She had fresh fruit, muffins, soda and more awaiting us. We were able to feed ourselves breakfast without going out. Speaking of going out, my kids just wanted to go back to the Airbnb. There were so many books, games and puzzles (and a candy jar!). Both of my girls had their own space, which was nice. We used an air mattress in the very large closet as a ""bedroom."" Thank you so much for your time putting together this wonderful retreat and for your hospitality."

Stayed one night","There aren't enough words to convey my feelings of appreciation and gratitude to Anita. She saved me during a snowstorm with a truly beautiful space and unparalleled hospitality and care. The attention to detail in the space is remarkable. It is unbelievably thoughtfully and creatively decorated, with amazing retro-style appliances, as well as a very useful washer/dryer. Anita also brought me dinner during my stay, knowing that I might not have any food after getting stranded by the storm. I have never encountered such selfless hospitality, and I simply can't recommend a stay at either of Anita's listings enough. She is a kind and caring host who will make sure you have everything you need. If there were an Airbnb host prize, I would nominate Anita. But since I am limited to this review, I'll just say- if you're in this part of town, you will not find a nicer place, or a nicer person to host you."

Her decor is so beautiful and unique and the book collection is outstanding! The only thing I wish this Airbnb had was at least one tv but still can’t complain. 10/10 would definitely recommend ☺️

Stayed a few nights","I SELDOM post reviews for anything or just ""things"" as in online retailers, shops, sellers, etc. What I do value are ""experiences"" as in countries, places and people. While I have all the ""elite"" status rewards with all major hospitality brands and could've stayed with one by Interstate-55, given the environment, I chose to go with Airbnb (my first time) and with Anita's place visiting Brookhaven from NYC-metro area just to get away from it all for a week. What an amazing place and experience. Anita (and her husband) are genuinely, true, humble, authentic, welcoming southern good people and the apartment/loft is just out of this world! Very well-kept, super clean, with quirky (in a good way) decor and just what I needed to be in to forget all the ""Breaking News"" happening back home. Anita even offered a home-cooked meal and invited me to Sunday service. I highly, highly recommend this place and, truly, what a happy place this is! I'll definitely stay here were I to return to Brookhaven. Thank you, A & M!"

It’s small but very well planned out and has everything you need along with a little extra for comfort and entertainment. The book collection in the loft is incredible and you’ll wish this place was yours to keep. One thing to note: the sleeping situation is a twin bed, and then there are good quality air mattresses and auto pump available. Anita is so sweet and helpful, and the check in and check out process were a breeze. Would 100% recommend 🙂"

Stayed a few nights","As I removed myself from the hustle and bustle of the rat race called life, my mind screamed for some peace and quiet. I told my daughter, and she instantly booked me 3 days and nights at “The Townhouse on Richland “, in Brookhaven, MS. Rejuvenation of life began. It was located on a street with a lot of other houses. However, you literally had to open the door and go outside to know that other life existed. It was so serene and quiet. Once my husband and I stepped inside the house and closed the door, we were in another world. We really didn’t have to go out for anything. There were 2 large luxurious bathrooms with all the amenities needed, 2 nice sized bedrooms with plenty of closet space, a very spacious living/dining room, a kitchen to die for, a Washer&dryer, and wifi. Even with all of that, our favorite spot was the sitting patio on the back of the house with the rocking chairs and grill. Other than bed, we spent most of our time there rocking, talking, and falling asleep"

The cabin itself was nicely furnished and cozy, with comfortable beds ensuring a restful night's sleep. The shower was spacious and there was plenty of extra linens.
We appreciated the thoughtful touches, such as the snacks/drinks that were waiting for us when we arrived. There was even extras in the bathroom incase you forgot something!
Exploring the property was the highlight of our stay, we loved roaming the fields and picking our own berries! The cows were beautiful and we really enjoyed seeing them everyday.
Overall, our experience exceeded expectations. We're already looking forward to returning! A huge thank you to the hosts and owners for always being so kind and for sharing this beautiful home!"

This log cabin was vibrant with life: handmade quilts, doilies, pottery, paintings, wood- real wood and not veneer. There were also the excellent extras for the weary traveler: pizza and cokes, special treats and coffee. It was comfortable and so full of personality."

The host was very responsive and cordially accepted my request. The description matches perfectly with what was equipped in the cabin. The host usually responded to my questions within minutes. I highly recommend this location if you and your family are longing for quietness and peace out of busy city life.

Troy was very kind, his response time to any questions was within a few short minutes & he went above & beyond to meet all of our needs . The house had a personal feel to it which made it feel so much like home, we were treated with house warming snacks which was extremely thoughtful, & everything was very tidy & cozy. Without question we will be returning customers next year."

Stayed with a pet","The Bird’s Nest is wonderful & I highly recommend staying here. It is very clean & well kept. The pictures do not do it justice. The layout feels open, ceilings are high, beds are very comfortable. The house is fully stocked with anything needed for a relaxing stay. Troy even provided drinks and snacks. The personal touches - books & wall hangings & seasonal decorations - were great. It was like going home for a visit with family. The front porch has nice chairs & was a great place to relax in the morning. There is plenty of closet space. The property is lovely. Our dogs were fascinated with the cows in the pastures. It was so quiet & peaceful & we could see the Milky Way at night. Troy was such a great host: communicating with us, answering our many questions quickly & offering all kinds of recommendations for our stay. We took some road trips to Natchez, Biloxi, Vicksburg & Jackson. Red Bluff nearby was really cool to see. We & the dogs loved everything about the place."

Everything was described accurately and Troy went above and beyond to make sure things were ready for us. He even stocked the fridge with drinks and had a nice selection of snacks. Nice setting out in the country. Huge thank you to Troy for working with us after 9:00 p.m. to assist us when our nephew who was with us had an asthma attack. I wish Troy well as he shares this place with others.

Stayed with a pet","The TRUTH about the quality of this home is not disclosed in this listing. A HORRIBLE SMELL permeates the ENTIRE HOUSE. The house smelt like smoke and something was burnt inside of it. No amount of Febreze or Lysol would get rid of or mask the smell.
I called and asked Tori about the smell shortly AFTER I checked into the property. Tori stated that a prior guest burned the floor in the kitchen and AirBNB was going to repair or replace the damaged floor.
A fire damaged property shouldn’t be rented until it’s repaired and the smoke smell is eradicated! Tori showed no dignity or respect for humanity as long as she got paid!
I was in town for my Grandmother’s Funeral and decided to leave the house around 8pm after I spoke to AirBNB. I had to find someplace else to stay. Tori called me and said I needed to be out of the house by 9pm; she and her husband were coming to change the code. Such disrespect and lack of compassion. I would never stay at this house or recommend it to anyone."

Group trip","Tori is one of my favorite hosts I have seen on this app thus far. For starters, her communication is consistent, she messages back in a timely manner. I rented this Air BNB as a surprise for two of my friends who flew in from Maryland. We are a group of friends who grew up together, graduated high school and college together. It has been a while since we all have seen one another due to our friends moving out of state. The Heart of Wesson was the best location for us, private and quiet neighborhood. House is exactly like pictures, and looks even better in person. We enjoyed our stay and will be visiting again soon!"

My only qualm was with the beds, we have a queen sized bed at home and the bed that we thought was a queen was smaller so we didn't have near as much room as we were expecting. Otherwise, everything was wonderful and given the opportunity we would definitely stay here again!"

Anita had everything set up for me so that when I got there, it was like showing up at home after a trip on the road. She made sure to let me know she was available if I needed anything at all, but was also a great enough host to recognize that I didn't need anything and remained virtually non-existent for the duration of my stay. I would have never known that my stay was part of their house. Thank you for a beautiful stay, Anita. I'll definitely be back again."

Stellar communication, wonderful private accommodations, and excellent location accessibility in between Jackson, Natchez, or Hattiesburg. Brookhaven was a lovely little town with nearby bike trails, Amtrak train stations, or views away from the city. Be advised, cell service can be hit or miss though.
Anita even provided a quick breakfast in the morning and made sure I was comfortable every step of the way. Southern hospitality personified. Phenomenal. Will stay again if I'm back in Mississippi!"

Stocked pantry, spacious living area, comfy bedroom, peaceful grounds, beautiful decor and accommodating bath was much more than we expected! A very welcome sight after a long car journey from Virginia/Georgia! Always available to take our calls and texts, answer questions and she even had a pack n play we could use. She took the time to meet us and we chatted like we were family, in fact she knows some of our relatives! Great dining recommendations, too. We felt so welcome. She shared her home and property with us, and we are forever grateful for her true southern hospitality. She has a big passion for hosting folks. Definitely give her place a visit when you are in Brookhaven. You will love it! *Thank you Anita and many blessings to you and your family!*"

And Anita had little extras throughout the suite that made it exceptional. This was a business trip, but I really felt like I was on vacation. Am hoping my agency will send me back to Brookhaven!

Her place is immaculately clean and full of charm and very homey! The 100% cotton sheets felt so soft and comfy and we both slept so well at her place! She is the “HOSTESS WITH THE MOSTEST”!

Stayed over a week","Staying at Anita’s place, expect great quality service and fast responses. Anita is very convenient and created a very homey place for others to rent out. She provides fresh towels throughout the stay, a keurig, small bowls and silverware, along with a microwave and fridge. We stayed with Anita for over two weeks and we truly enjoyed ourselves! 5 stars!"

Emily went out of her way to provide us with an ice chest after I asked if the place happened to have one… we appreciated it so much! It made our travel much easier. We recommend staying here, we sure will if we are ever in Brookhaven again"

Stayed a few nights",Emily and Jason are fantastic host. We had an extended stay there that was so great we booked the in laws for Easter. This home is clean spic and span and full of character. It is peaceful and quiet yet close to everything. During a previous stay we had a family of deer in the mornings off the back patio. This is an A++++ property and overall experience. We will for sure be recommending this home to our friends who have families coming to town or who need a staycation!

The home looks small from the outside but is very spacious and clean. Lush beds, quality linen, clean fridge... the things you want when you are traveling. I'm already familiar with the area but I had never seen this treasure. I plan to visit again soon."

Group trip","Cecily is a good host and responded to some hiccups in a timely manner. Her place was good for our family of five. Really nice furnishings and modern loft.
My main concern was the open stairways that did not feel private or safe and thus, not secure. The main staircase should be closed off at the street as an entrance with a locked door. Anyone could follow you up.
It can be noisy with the train and the loud thumping music from cars, but the listing does note that.
I would suggest kitchen knives to chop up veggies, luggage racks, and blackout curtains under the wispy sheet curtains.
The plus side of the location is that the downtown area is walkable and very close."

She communicated effectively, She was intentional about responding in a timely manner. She made it a point to be sure that my husband and I had everything that we needed plus more. We could not have asked for a better stay at the loft. We are forever grateful for Cecily."

The loft is so cute and was very child friendly (toys/high chair/pack and play) which we liked. It was so close to everywhere we went. Cecily responds quickly and was very professional and kind. The loft is stocked nicely/great air flow in the humid summer/ clean/ and we enjoyed our stay here. We’d love to stay here again next time we visit family.

Stayed over a week","The place was great! I was there for 3 weeks and needed an iron and they supplied. the space was very clean and spacious.
The only downside (which is a plus for anyone who's a morning person) is that the bedroom has sheet curtains, so allll of the morning light gets in. Very hard to sleep past sunrise. Otherwise loved all the natural light.
They had all the amenities needed. Toothbrush, toothpaste, cotton swabs, qtips, etc!
Beds were firm and comfortable.
Tons of space and very well air conditioned!
Also I'm going to say it's a very safe neighborhood, been working there for about a year, but the lower door didn't close or secure really. The door to the main unit was very secure and I always felt safe, but the entrance is more or less wide open for anyone anytime. Just something to consider if you are a high anxiety person. Again, very safe place though.
Everything and everyone is very nice. cool coffee spot, great food, and music in the square.
Oh, there is a train."

Downtown is easily walkable. The only negatives are that the bathroom is pretty small and that the street noise was pretty loud (as well as the train). We’ll try to stay here again the next time we come to Brookhaven!"

Stayed a few nights","Typically when we visit Brookhaven we stay at a hotel. This trip we decided to look for an Airbnb apartment and were fortunate to find the Carlisle by Cecily. The apartment is beautiful and exceeded our expectations. It was spacious, child friendly and had all the accommodations we could ask for. The kitchen was wonderful to have and now I want that kitchen at home!!
I was concerned about it being in downtown but downtown Brookhaven has been renovated, has fantastic restaurants and is the ideal area to stay. My family is ready for our next visit and I hope the Carlisle by Cecily will be available. We would be disappointed if we had to stay any where else."
