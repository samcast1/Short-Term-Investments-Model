Stayed one night","The yurt is wonderful! It is a bit of a trek along a dirt road. I made it no problem in my Prius, though. Once you make it to the location, it is stunning, peaceful, and definitely worth the drive. If I got the chance to stay here again, I would stock up on snacks prior to driving out."

Stayed a few nights","We hadn’t been to Elko in years and were looking for a quiet space to spend the weekend while our kids camped in the Rubies. This was the perfect high desert getaway. The yurt was thoughtfully furnished with the character and peacefulness of the experience of a yurt kept in mind. The many windows let in great light and had beautiful views of the Ruby Mountains. The book on yurts and the album of building this one were a nice touch to connect to the space. Directions and communication were great. If back this way, will definitely stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","Shannon's yurt was a wonderful place to stay. The views are great. The interior was comfortable and had all that I needed. There was even a dog bed for my dog. When I posted my pictures on the socials, so many people reacted not knowing a yurt could be so comfortable and spacious. Arrive before dark to destress the first drive in."

Stayed with kids","stunning location and yurt. our kids absolutely loved it - such an adventure for them! not having running water was a great reminder and lesson for all of us to take note of how much we consume. living off grid felt very doable although we will be very excited when the shower is built :) using the porta potty wasn't an issue for us either!
highly recommend - best accomodation in the area by a long long shot"

Stayed a few nights",We had a GREAT stay at Shannon’s place! Directions were exact and we found it easy enough. It is a long dirt road but well worth it. Everything was easy to use and the porta potty was clean upon arrival which was a great relief knowing the shower/bathroom wasn’t ready yet. The heater warmed the place up very quickly and we didn’t have to keep it on all night to stay warm. This was an amazing experience and would stay again!!

Stayed with a pet","The yurt was cool but a little sparse, especially when considering the price. The roads are extremely rough and it was pretty difficult to get there. The location icon on the listing is not really accurate. The yurt has an amazing view, was very clean, but just felt partly finished. If it was a glamping listing I’d expect it to be cheaper, but since it’s a full listing I feel like there should be more amenities like a shower, better decor, etc."

Stayed with a pet","Had a nice time staying at the yurt while driving cross country!
First thing to note -- The Yurt is pretty off-the-beaten-path. It took me a good 35-40 minutes to get there from the Elko I-80 exit. The dirt road is in decent shape, but was slow going and I had to stop to review directions a few times.
Having said that, you are rewarded with seclusion and great natural beauty. Everything was nice and clean, and my dog, Wizard, enjoyed running around the property. Perfect after being cooped up in the car for 12 hours. I took an outdoor shower at sunset. Later in the evening, the rain made the fragrance of sage and juniper come alive. At sunrise, I heard the hooting of a Great Horned Owl nearby.
Shannon and Rob were super responsive and helpful in their communication.
Thank you kindly-- I'll be back!!"

Everything about the yurt had so much thought put in it - there were jugs of water, night lights, extra linens, a fan, wifi, and clear instructions. I felt so taken care of. This was one of the best airbnbs I’ve ever been to and I’m so appreciative of all the thought Shannon and Rob put into this special space! Cannot wait to go back."

Stayed one night","This was an amazing EXPERIENCE! We absolutely loved our stay! The view was beautiful ESPECIALLY sunset, the mountains like changed colors with the sunset from pink to purple to blue! It was so quiet and wonderful here! The outdoor chairs were great! Everything they had in the kitchen was so useful and we got to cook a great meal which was delicious!
I gave this a five star review and would definitely go again! My only comment would be that it was hard to control the temperature in the yurt. They do have a lovely AC and heater there, but when we arrived the yurt was 85 after an hour it went to 80 then later in the night it got cold so by 8pm it was 70 degrees which was nice. Then we left the windows open and when we woke up it was 52 degrees. So maybe don’t leave your windows open at night unless you like it that cold. Hahaha"

Stayed a few nights","No doubt, the view is fantastic and the yurt itself is super cool- I would stay again. The sunsets were phenomenal, and you can hear the cayotes calling to each other at dusk. The road to get to the yurt, took about 35 minutes from the paved road on a rocky dusty path but we were able to make trip in a Rav4 just fine. The port-a-potty was clean and not far from the yurt. The shower, that is offered is 500+ steps from the yurt though the trees and sagebrush, and as described, is outside the host's main house attached to their porch. We got to see a peacock roaming while showering. If you are a camper--you will LOVE the experience. If you have never camped, you may be put-off. Elko also has a bunch of Mormon Crickets- which are harmless but UGLY and chirpy. Shannon and Rob were responsive when we had difficulty locating the shower and when the Goal Zero device (run via solar panels) got to 40% and had to be switched to generator as it runs the fridge."

Stayed one night","What a relaxing and peaceful retreat. The home was spotless and cozy with everything you need for a rejuvenating escape. The trailer deck was perfect to sit while eating dinner and enjoy morning coffee on while taking in the amazing view. Shannon was very friendly and responsive including when I thought I needed help with something but ended up figuring it out only after they came right away to help early in the morning. The only note here is that during the drive to the home, there were thousands upon thousands of what we found out to be Mormon Crickets. Apparently they are especially bad this year. They’re harmless but they are all in the road and are unavoidable when driving up the dirt road so go slow:) We did not notice them around the residence."

The view is beautiful and it was nice to get away and have some privacy for a couple of days. I'm sure it will only get better in the future as they are still doing some construction, but it is already nicely livable so don't let that hold you back if you are okay with using a porta-potty. I would highly recommend staying here."

Stayed one night","Great place! The unpaved road in a downpour was interesting, but we made it with no problem. It’s further than you think. Also, the directions don’t mention the gate you need to open and close at the entrance to the driveway of the yurt. Very clean. No running water and you have to conserve electricity since it’s all solar, but we were in the middle of a fantastic lighting and thunder storm and it was fun to just sit and watch. A bathroom is being added, so there is only an outhouse, which can be a little unnerving to use at 3:00 in the morning. There isn’t a mirror, but maybe that’s a good thing. 😂. There were towels, but we didn’t see any wash cloths or hand towels. The WiFi worked great. The oversized “bean bag” was extremely comfortable—the bed not so much. We brought cards, games and food to cook. Great communication. Awesome view. Definitely recommend!"

Stayed with a pet","My (new) wife and I decided to break up our trip back to Las Vegas from getting married in Boise, ID last weekend by staying at Shannon and Rob’s awesome yurt. The place was secluded, quiet, and the views were spectacular. It was in no way hard to find with Shannon’s meticulous directions.
We caught a sunset and distant thunderclouds over a bottle of champagne that Shannon and Rob had so generously left for us in the fridge after learning of our recent newlywed status. It’s impossible not to leave this place without some yurt fever. We now have goals to build one ourselves.
Everything Shannon and Rob have put into the place works without a hitch, from the Goal Zero power supply, to the fridge, to the gas stove (with broiler). Our two Aussie dogs loved the freedom and privacy of the surrounding lands.
We will most certainly be returning once the bathroom is completed and to see what else they put into it and the surroundings. Thanks for sharing your slice of heaven with us!

Stayed one night","This yurt is awesome! It’s well build and well planned out.
It is about 40 mins one way off the highway. Fifteen minutes of that is dirt road. Ten minutes of that dirt road is slower rougher dirt road. We ran into a crazy rain storm which slowed down our plans. That put us arriving in the dark. I would recommend coming in the daylight. We did get lost on the dirt roads but Shannon was very helpful and had great communication with us.
Make sure you bring food supplies with you as it is a long way back to town.
The wifi was great and their dog was very friendly."

Stayed with a pet","The property was lovely! I'm sure it will be even better once the bathroom is completed. The view was incredible, and I only wish we could have stayed longer. Shannon was delightful to meet and very welcoming. I was and am especially appreciative that she was able to bump us to the following day after car trouble set us behind. It was extremely kind, and very much appreciated by my family (husband, large dog, and 4-month old). We needed the help!
Her directions were also spot on! It might seem difficult to reach, but it isn't that bad of a drive (our old sedan made it fine). If you're driving through on 80 it only adds 25-30 minutes to the trip in each direction. Getting off the highway for a bit was a nice treat.
Thank you again for your kindness and sharing your relaxing spot!"

Stayed with kids","We stopped here for the night while on our cross country road trip. Pretty neat experience and very clean, which we greatly appreciated. The hosts made sure we were comfortable and they had the yurt well stocked. This place is pretty secluded, which we enjoyed being able to getaway from busy city life. It was fun seeing cows walking along the road. For families traveling with a toddler or baby, this place isn't really childproof (i.e., extension cords laying around inside hooking things up to a generator). Bed was very comfortable and they had great sheets! Our toddler also loved the big beanbag bed! If traveling in the summer, the yurt can be on the warmer side during the day since there isn't a fan or ac, but there was a nice breeze at night to cool down."

Stayed a few nights","Shannon's yurt was the perfect blend of modernity and seclusion. The drive takes about 20 minutes after you start on the road as its slow going, the directions were good. The yurt itself was beautiful inside and exactly as shown. It's still under partial construction but this was a non-factor. The bed was very comfortable and the area very peaceful. I definitely enjoyed talking with both Shannon and Rob and will definitely stay again."

Stayed with a pet","We loved this yurt! It was even better in person than shown in the pictures. It was clean, fresh, welcoming and had such lovely views out the picture windows. The directions Shannon provided were spot on and made it easy to find.
The bed was super comfy, and the furnishings were top notch and just gorgeous.
The owners are still prepping it so it wasn't ready to be launched - there is no running water, or electricity. They did provide a couple of water jugs. They had a generator with a heater, and that allowed the fridge and stove to work. There is port-a-potty outside which is a bit of an adventure in the middle of the night from the bed in the balcony. Despite these challenges we hope to come back and are already wondering how we might pass through Elko in the years to come so we can visit."

Stayed one night","Really awesome yurt. Even though it wasn't quite finished when we stayed, it was still the nicest yurt we've stayed at. Great location that truly feels out of the way. Super comfy and great amenities. Plus the view is amazing! The dirt road to get there was fun to go down and Shannon's directions to us straight there. We're already trying to plan our next stay here to see more of the rubies."

The written instructions are excellent but without being able to see landmarks we struggled a bit in the dark. The owners are still adding to the property so we are interested in going back after its all finished.

She also provided *multiple* surge strips all over the place, if for some reason you have more than one charger to plug in (and I had a ton of things to plug in, so this gesture *alone* endeared Vickie to me forever).

I arrived very late as I was driving slowly on some snow packed roads and Vickie was so kind and waited for me. I’m very thankful to Vickie for sharing her place with me. I’m definitely coming back to stay again.

The bed was comfortable, bathroom was clean with individual packaged soap, shampoo, and conditioner, the shower water was hot and clean. I had a lot of privacy and she even answered some questions I had about the area! I watched some tv and saw she had left out and fan and a heater for me along with two bottles of water! In the morning it had snowed overnight and they were kind enough to leave a brush out for me to brush off my truck. 10/10 would stay here again, i definitely recommend!"

She graciously let us park our car in her garage since we were moving and had a bunch of our possessions in it, and the neighborhood also seemed very quiet and peaceful so it felt very safe. The place itself was amazing and way exceeded my expectations -- super spacious, impeccably clean, cutely decorated, and perfectly warm and cozy (which I was a little worried about since it was winter and ~10 degrees outside). Definitely recommend!"

Stayed one night","Good communication from the host.
When retrieving the key from the lockbox on the front porch, we heard a large-sounding dog start barking on the other side of the door. But then we heard someone take it away and we were grateful not to hear it again the rest of our one-night stay. Got in the front door without any incident.
Place smelled quite strongly of scented cleaning products and/or ""air freshening"" units.
There is a door at the bottom of the indoor stairs which separates the rental unit from the rest of the house.
Decor inside the unit is awkward and haphazard, with pictures of the host's family members taking up several shelves.
We were able to clear out most of the smell of cleaning products and/or air-scenting units by opening the windows (this was early August). Left them open all night, and were pleased with how quiet the neighborhood was and how pleasant the temperature.
Appreciated the host's posted signage that it was unnecessary to strip any bedding and that we were welcome to leave any used dishes in a dedicated bin that would be washed for us."

WiFi was fast enough to get the job done (I measured 20 Mbps down, 2 up with a WiFi 6 capable machine, so if you're a remote worker, that should work fine.

But, the best was the shower I’m 6’3” and it was so nice to enjoy a shower actually standing up lol but it’s not funny we will be back and will make sure to book another room with Vicki and her family this is the way booking and vacation should be!!!!! Happy happy to visit"

Vickie kindly offered us her garage parking so we could keep our mountain bike inside - we appreciate the accommodation :)

Vickie a nice host, greeted us but otherwise it was as if we had the place to ourselves. Pretty much perfect for a one-night stay on the way from the San Francisco Bay Area to Jackson. We'll be back when traveling this way again."

Stayed one night","This place is great for a quick stop off - close to the freeway and near lots of restaurants. Because it’s near the freeway there is some traffic noise, but I wasn’t bothered as I travel with a white noise machine and slept like a dream. The bed was cozy and I loved having the mini fridge and microwave. Wi-Fi was east and fast to connect to, and I took a bath upon my arrival — so clutch for on the road recovery. Check in was easy, even though it seemed my reservation through air bnb wasn’t communicated to whomever was at the front desk. I also never heard from “bob” or anyone via the app. Which is fine, I was able to check in regardless, I just wouldn’t say it was the friendliest or most smooth interaction ever. The breakfast available is cold cereal and oatmeal packets, juice, milk, and a coffee and tea bar."

Our room had a good sized hotel fridge and microwave along with the other usual amenities. The bed was comfy with nice linens and the bathroom had a blow dryer and nice towels. There was coffee and continental breakfast at 6 AM. We recommend renting a room from Bob if you’re in the Elko Nevada area.

The minute I saw this place it was a sigh of relief that there were still people around that care about the old construction and take care if it. Very cozy room with 2 queen beds a fridge, microwave and all the amenities. Nestled in a preserved western downtown that commemorates the bygone days of the cowboy. The downtown area has a great Italian restaurant, coffee shop, breakfast place, bowling alley and old bars. Downtown buildings from the 1800’s still intact. AND The people in town always stopped and let you cross the streets! A definite destination spot."

The only downside was that the noise from loud cars and motorbikes came through. But that was due to the age of the building. It did quiet down during the night. The maid knocked on our door early, not really a problem. Bob apologized several times, saying they thought we were already gone.
The other oddity was from other guests. One fellow parked his Mustang GT outside our room and would rev the engine. Wasn't a problem later on though. Other guests couldn't park between the lines.
We had a fun chat with Bob about travels and other things."

Diabetics, be forewarned that the complementary breakfast in the morning had very high sugar content (cereal, yogurt, pastries, juice, coffee, apples/bananas) but no protein options (eggs, bacon, etc). Still, for the very affordable nightly price I was grateful for breakfast at all! Thanks again! :)"

The only issues we had during our stay were a slow wifi connection and noise at night, but the noise is to be expected based on the location, and we weren’t dependent on the wifi so it didn’t affect our stay.

Stayed with a pet",What a great find. Lori's home was bigger than I thought it would be! Very easy to find. Love having a dedicated parking spot right out front as I had so much luggage. The yard was an extra bonus to let the dogs have a break. Thoughtful touches within the house included snacks and items for the dogs like leashes and bags in case you forgot to bring some. The neighborhood is very peaceful and walkable. Nice and quiet so I got a great night's sleep. Lori is very kind and responsive. It was a very nice stay to recoup from a long road trip.

My pup Ginny runs to the front door as soon as we get there. It’s small and cozy and feels like home. It’s very centrally located around shopping and restaurants. All the restaurants are great and lots to choose from. Cowboy Rest is on a quiet street and the house is well lit. You have to park on the street but that’s probably 30ft from the front door. The interstate is not far so it’s easy to find. I’m already planning my next stay, I have not considered staying anywhere else. Lori is an amazing and excellent host and always makes our stay a pleasure."

She was more than accommodating. The only tough part for us is we required AC and unfortunately she doesn't have the AC going until June. Just an FYI. But she went out of her way for us, and we were very grateful for her. Would definitely would stay here again (after June, one the AC is in place). Winter months, if your looking for a warm cozy place, this is it."

So clean; so well decorated, so easy to check in and out. Plenty of amenities and even treats for our dog. We will stay when we are in town again. We are so grateful to have found it!"

I recommend it to anyone who is passing through the area or who might be there for longer. Lori warns about street noise - I didn't notice any, tho I was there over the weekend."

It’s in a great neighborhood and actually within walking distance to downtown and lots of great restaurants. I highly recommend Cook’s and The Coffee Mug. There are several restaurants, wish we would have had more time. The Tiny house is very cozy and has everything you need. Lori is an amazing host and answered all my questions and made sure my stay was comfortable. The yard is perfectly fenced for my Ginny and Lori even had a doggie dish, leash and directions to the doggie park. The first night which normally I have to get used to my surroundings I fell asleep instantly and never moved a muscle. It was great. All in all I visit Elko often because my son and family live here and the Tiny House will be my go to place to stay."

Only suggestion would be to have at least 2 ceramic mugs for coffee and get rid of the plastic! Really hard to drink out of, with awkward handles. And dining is on TV trays in the couch, which was fine. Still 5 stars for what it is and would stay there again. Good yard for the puppy, but AWESOME brand new dog park just a few blocks away. Good communication."

From the description it seemed that it might be in walking distance of the downtown area, but was further away than I had thought. It is in a residential neighborhood just around the corner form a busy road so a bit noisy. Note that on a hot day (close to 100 degrees) with only one AC unit in the bedroom it was not possible to cool the living room. The good news is that it cooled down at night and we were able to open some windows. Convenient from 80 for a quick stay when driving through Nevada."

Sat in spatub on the deck under Snow flurries with the most beautiful views of snow covered mountains in all directions. Pottered around home gazing at lovely antiques and artwork. Deer meandering through the yard early morning. I enjoy Airbnbs when traveling and must admit this home location and Memories Made was 1 of the Best! Thank you Amber for sharing this lovely home.

Stayed a few nights",Great little home outside of Elko. Was the perfect size for me and three of my buddies for a few days. It has a hot tub and a covered porch which is great for watching the sun rise over those beautiful Nevada mountains.

Stayed a few nights","The rest of the stay can be summed up as follows: The ""mural"" sized picture window out the kitchen showcased the desert and lake, with mesas and mountains behind. The views didn't end there. There were numerous large windows in this sagebrush desert setting. We enjoyed the large shaded deck; and the spa one evening. The kitchen was well stocked; but we also enjoyed dining in Elko at Mattie's and Coffee Mug. It was a perfect place for a relaxing vacation!"

Stayed with kids","This was a nice central spot for us to drive from Southern Idaho and meet with our son and his wife and baby from Northern Nevada. The home was super clean for an older home. It had everything we needed with quite a few extra amenities like propane barbecue and fire pit, hot tub, washer/dryer, dvds, a few games, lots of towels, laundry soap, shampoo, conditioner, body wash and soap, blow dryer, dish soap and dishwasher detergent and a few kitchen staples like oil and spices. There is lots of cute decor to enjoy. Kitchen and bath are fully stocked. Beds were comfy and bedding was soft. Water pressure was very good. The property is spacious and landscaped nicely with grass and trees. The deck covered and uncovered is large for outdoor gatherings. We enjoyed the view of the quiet lake. I didn’t get a chance to get my SUP on the water but it looked inviting and local day use visitors were friendly. The nearest store is is really nice and about 10 miles away. The coffee pot is drip and there is a bean grinder if you are wondering what kind of coffee to bring. Bring your Netflix password to log in.
I recommend this home to anyone wanting to relax, escape and feel at home in the Elko area. Hostess Amber was very responsive."

We started our mornings enjoying breakfast on the deck and came back each evening, soaked in the hot tub before dinner on the back patio, and then wonderful sound sleep. The location seems pretty remote to us urbanites, yet was quiet and peaceful. The property has some lovely trees surrounding it, as well as nice views of South Fork Reservoir and the nearby mountains. Amber has thought of everything guests could need or want and was a great communicator. We’re glad we stayed at Amber’s place!"

We didn’t get to enjoy the outdoors much because the wind and rain kept us indoors. Everything we used worked well, the kitchen is the best stocked kitchen of any AirBnB we’ve stayed in this far. The bed was very comfortable with extra blankets available. Would definitely stay again!
The internet was very slow, but that is common in rural areas, especially during wind/rain storms. There are some DVDs provided. If you’re concerned about being stuck indoors bring some dvds also. We will probably book again for a summer stay when we can enjoy the property and the lake more."

Stayed with kids","Amber’s cottage is such a beautiful place to stay and a great value! My family and I stayed here during Christmas week. The home was surrounded by beautiful snow-covered mountains with a lake down the road. It was a bit windy some of the days, but that’s to be expected during the winter. My daughter loved playing outside in the snow. We had everything we needed to feel at home. The kitchen was well equipped with cookware and utensils, so we were able to cook and make Christmas dinner during our stay. If you like to drink hot tea or cocoa, I do recommend bringing your own tea kettle, as there isn’t one in the home; however, we did just fine without one and were able to boil water in a mug using the microwave. The dining room had enough seating for all 6 of us to eat together. The living room had cozy recliners and a sofa, where we watched TV together and connected to our Netflix account. The water stayed nice and hot throughout the home. The decor inside the home was very cute as well, with a lot of little bird houses. If you choose to wash laundry, it does take a while to dry (3 cycles of drying per load). Make sure you wash in small loads. Amber provided laundry soap and plenty of clean towels for our stay. I had a really great time. If I had any questions or needed anything during my stay, Amber always responded quickly and made sure to send her Housekeeper. I definitely recommend you check out this gem! You won’t regret it. I would love to stay again, in the future, during the spring or summer months, so I can make use of the lake and better use of the hot tub. Thank you for hosting us! My family and I will cherish the memories we made forever."

I also appreciated the outdoor-themed decorations and knick-knacks scattered around the place. I would not hesitate to rent this place again, and recommend it to anyone who is planning a trip to South Fork Reservoir."

The location is amazing and the scenery was magnificent. The house is cute and quirky with all of the amenities that you could need. We stayed for 2 days and brought our own food to cook and grill.
The beds are all comfortable and the kitchen has all of the things needed for cooking.
We enjoyed the jacuzzi under the bright moon and stars and woke up to deer grazing in the yard in mornings.
The area has a lot more to offer than casinos, we enjoyed Lamoille Canyon along with a fun day of fossil hunting in the hills. And an arcade in the area for kids.
The house is off the beaten path, close enough to town to enjoyed the city but far enoughto get away from the people and lights to enjoy the natural beauty the area has to offer."

When you wake up in the morning to have a hot cup of coffee, look out over the lake from a portrait style window in the kitchen and just take in the fact that you are away from the crazy. At this time, you can see deer, birds, and other beautiful wildlife fill this beautiful frame.
The ruby mountains are just next door and made for a wonderful adventure outdoors.

The 1911 craftsman’s style Rowe house has been completely remodeled inside with high end materials and furnishings. There is an inviting private outside seating area. It was a perfect base for exploring the nearby Ruby Mountains with the incredibly scenic Lemoille Canyon. Check out the California Trail Interpretive Center just a few miles west. We ran out of time to experience more of the Basque culture in the local area. We will just have to come back! Thank you too for the chocolate and coffee treats."

My family and I stayed For a New years Eve 80th birthday for my Mom.
Which was held in the late afternoon early evening.
The place only has one bathroom, however we all had to get ready back to back and we never ran out of Hot water…. So the accommodation of one bathroom worked out……
Then we came back to house and had our own family New Year Eve party with the kids..
The kitchen is a chefs dream two oven, stove top large kitchen sink and plenty of counter space for preparing meals.
The beds were super comfortable and the kids room was perfect for our littles…. ( cousin sleep over)
We plan on coming back this spring or Summer
Can’t wait to use the amazing patio weather permitting…..
The Host is very friendly and professional…."

Everything was very comfortable for our short one night stay on a long drive between California and Colorado. While the listing states it’s an entire house, that isn’t exactly accurate… The place where you’ll be staying is attached to the main house but is completely separate so you have your own space. That said, it still is attached to the main house by one entire wall with a locked private door in between the main house and the self-contained unit. Regardless, it was perfect for a short overnight stay and we would definitely stay here again if/when making this long drive again! Thank you, Jeanne!"

Stayed a few nights","Not as advertised, and overrated. Space is advertised as an “entire place,” but in reality just a small addition onto the hosts home with noise insulation that did not work. Even “apartment” would be a stretch, I could hear the hosts very clearly thru the shared wall and door, and made the expectation of privacy one would have with an entire home impossible. The host posted a picture of their own home on the listing, and this was very misleading. Would be fine for one person , but for a couples vacation this property was disappointing. Bed was also quite small for 2 adults.
Decor was cute tho, and there were nice touches such as a diffuser, sound machine, electric fireplace, and some coffee and tea. All of which were appreciated, and improved the stay. The hosts were also quite nice, and I’d chalk this up as an accident in the listing information, rather than intentionally misleading renters. A hotel room would have been a better choice."

Soundproofing was added over door, but could still hear host(s) or their TV, so I believe this is important to note. I missed it in the description and was not thinking it was a shared home with Jeanne. We just stayed 1 night and were comfortable enough. Space was a bit tight, but let’s call it cozy! Clean enough. Thanks Jeanne!"

Stayed with a pet","My husband and I had a lovely stay at Jeanne’s place. It was located in a quiet neighborhood, but was close to everything we needed. We were there primarily to hike in Lamoille Canyon so this was the perfect place, as it was just a short drive away. Jeanne was very friendly, and offered lots of suggestions for places to eat and visit, and things to do in the area. She was also very welcoming to our two dogs.
The “apartment” is small, but suited our needs. The bed was comfortable, the shower warm, and the TV and wifi worked well. There is a microwave and a coffee maker provided too. There is a small outdoor seating area with a lovely view of the Ruby Mountains. Currently there is not a fenced area for your dog, but Jeanne assured us that she was working on resolving that situation. In fact there was a workman there during our stay fixing some of the fencing.
Overall, I would certainly recommend staying with Jeanne if you want a quieter, more rural setting which we certainly did."

Sometimes, one of the most rewarding parts of traveling is the people you meet along the way. Jeanne was one of those people. We really enjoyed our conversations about the mountains in the area, her experiences in the gold mines, and her openness and kindness to all as family. We hope you get the chance to meet her.
You will be very happy to spend time at this comfortable, private, safe haven in a desert like community.

Stayed one night","My father and I stayed only one night, arriving late and leaving early —on a tight cross country move schedule— so we didn’t spend much time at Jeanne’s place. That said, it was still a very pleasant experience!
The place is about 12 miles off of I-80, but very easy to reach. It is a quaint, quite neighborhood, with beautiful views, as promised on the listing! Jeanne has a side entrance to access the guest part of the house, with a beautiful and relaxing outdoor space, also plenty of parking on the property.
The living area and bedroom are small, but the bathroom is large and everything is spotless! No kitchen, but there is a little coffee station and small fridge. The bedroom has a window AC unit which keeps the room nice and cool, but if you have someone staying on the futon in the living room, it gets hot at night.
Jeanne was lovely, easy to message, and clear with instructions. She also left is a nice message and wished us well on our journey! Great place for a quick stay!"

The bed was incredibly comfortable - in fact, it was the most comfortable bed we've ever slept on at any Airbnb listing. After a long drive from California, it was a true blessing to arrive at Jeanne's place. We were so lucky to have been able to stay twice due to our travels to Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, and Utah. If you're in need of a place to stay while traveling, this place is perfect for it. We especially enjoyed watching the stunning sunsets and sunrises from the property, and we were even lucky enough to experience it while it was snowing. Jeanne also provided us with a pet blanket for our 10-week-old kitten, which was such a heartwarming gesture. The parking space was ample, the heaters warmed up the home perfectly, and coffee was provided. The pictures really don't do justice, it is beautiful. We highly recommend Jeanne's place."

Stayed a few nights","Jeanne’s place was perfect for our stay! Private entrance, very clean and the bed! Oh my gosh it was so comfortable! The house is older with floorboard heaters but we were so cozy! Jeanne also went as far as to place 2 space heaters in the area to have the place warm and cozy for our arrival. She was very responsive and had asked if I wanted any surprises put in the room for my husbands birthday. So thoughtful! She also recommended a local steak house that was fantastic. We enjoyed every minute of our stay and exploring the towns and mountains. Great place to stay!"

Stayed one night","We have stayed at Jeanne's place twice, and it is one of our favorite rentals anywhere. It is so nice to roll into town and know there is a comfy bed waiting for us. This place is lovely, and we appreciate it being a little off the beaten track a little (just about 10 minutes out of town)--quiet and feels safe, which is important because we usually have a car filled with gear. There is a parking space right next to the door (no steps), and Jeanne always has the walk cleared (we were there in snow). It would be fun to stay here in the other seasons when we can explore the Ruby mountains area, which is right nearby. Highly recommend if you are coming through Elko."

The place is exceptionally clean, the bed is one of the comfiest I’ve slept on in an AirBnB, and the snow-capped mountains were a delight to wake up to. The neighborhood was easy to navigate and felt very safe."

The views are great and it's only about 20 minutes from the beautiful Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest, Elko, and South Fork state recreation area. The place was stocked with everything you need to be comfortable during your stay, and the bed is super comfortable. A safe, quiet, and very pleasant place to stay. I stayed for 2 weeks while traveling for work and this was such a lovely place to come home to. Would absolutely recommend this place and Jeanne, who is a fantastic host!"

The neighborhood is very peaceful and quiet with large lots. We didn't feel like we were disturbing the neighbors. The bed was comfortable, the facility very clean, and we appreciated the large To-Go coffee cups. The circular driveway made it super convenient since we were driving a large U-Haul. I would highly recommend this gem."

The added touches were much appreciated, especially the diffuser with lavender oil. Excellent stay all around!"

Stayed with kids","Jeanne's place is an amazing place to stay while visiting the Ruby Mountains. It is clean, comfortable, and has everything you need. Though the main reason you want to stay here instead of somewhere else is Jeanne. She is the nicest person you will ever meet and goes above and beyond any host you will have. When I say this I am not exaggerating. When we made a stop here it just happened our fridge in our van broke. She not only let us order a new one there but she helped us install it in our van! Let me just say we will never forget our time at Jeanne's, but also her generosity. When we come back through Elko, we will definitely stay here again and say hi to Jeanne!"

Stayed with a pet","I only stayed one night on my trip from California to Utah (with my dog) but it was a most welcome break after 550 miles of driving alone. Tried to take a walk but just too hot but would love to come back to hike in the nearby Ruby Mountains. Jeanne is the most gracious host and the attached one bedroom while lacking a kitchen makes up for it in cleanliness and comfort - including a private patio and parking right outside the front door. The bed and shower are excellent. There is also a mini-microwave and a little refrigerator, coffee and tea, sodas and water chilled. And Jeanne made us cookies too! Lovely stay and will be back. Thank you."

It’s only about a 15-20 min distance to the head of the hiking trails in Lamoille Canyon, we hiked each morning up to the lakes and spent the days fly fishing the river. South Fork Reservoir was great to glass deer, ducks and pelicans. Jeanne and her husband were very friendly, helpful and accommodating in every way!"

The apartment was way more spacious than we had expected, and the private yard was a great place to relax and enjoy the view. The only reason we are giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is that we found the lighting inadequate for reading and the lack of a sink in the coffee/ microwave area slightly problematic."
