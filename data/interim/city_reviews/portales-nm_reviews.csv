Stayed a few nights","I worked from before dawn to mid-day on a project in the area. Tina's place was handy to the work, and most importantly, was quiet in the evening (all times, really) when I went to bed early!
Further, she found a tee shirt I hung on a door and forgot, and offered to snail mail it to me. Then I realized I was also short a cheese slicer and small knife, so she added that to the ""care package"" she will be sending me. That speaks volumes of her attention to detail."

Stayed a few nights","This Airbnb was incredible!
I was here for my son‘s graduation from ENMU and the location was perfect.
Each step of the way, Tina was responsive and made sure that I had everything that I needed.
Incredibly clean location with everything needed to make a guest comfortable.
I would highly recommend this stylish, cute and comfortable Airbnb.
Thank you, Tina!"

I loved the neatness, the aesthetic, the attention to detail put into this place. Cleanliness is not even a question. I know our host has spent nights here just looking for missed details and coming up with ways to make it better.
It’s a bargain."

Had directions written around house to make using lights and stuff easier to know what is what. Large Roku TV for streaming & wifi in the casita. Tina answered any questions I had very quickly and reached out during my stay as well to make sure everything was going okay. If we go back before moving out there in Jan. we will definitely be staying here again. Will definitely be recommending to my parents as well when they come visit my baby and I at the college!"

Stayed one night","Juan's 2 bedroom home is a hidden jewel! We were driving a uHaul and car, and the house has such a long single track driveway, we could have fit another car! Located literally a block from downtown Portales, the exterior is very simple and modest, in keeping with the older neighborhood, but the interior is a surprise - updated and modern, and very comfortable with many thoughtful touches. We spent a quiet, peaceful night and really enjoyed our short stay!"

Stayed about a week","Places to stay in Portales are hard to come by. The house, while in an older neighborhood, has been remodeled in the inside and is very clean. The driveway holds at least 3 vehicles and has security cams and is well lit. The house is on Main Street and just a couple blocks from the local brewery. The beds were comfortable and the water was hot. I don’t believe there are any neighbors on either side so it was very quiet. I look forward to staying there again in the future. It is a great value."

Me and my guess 2nd time round did have to come in and wipe down the kitchen a bit. But as usual we also come in and disinfect just in case, you know. Check in and Check out is great and flexible. Overall Great host. Will recommend time n time again. Mikale made the environment very comfortable.
Side note: if you aren’t a fan of barking dogs or noises in the AM, this may disrupt your stay. But it didn’t disrupt mine. Like i said before such great stay and host."

Stayed one night","A good place to stay if you’re in an out. Not a safe area. Bring protection or travel in a group. House is small with an abandoned building behind it. I felt very uncomfortable. There also is no way to lock the door/deadbolt aside from the keypad, so no protection from owners, god for is something was wrong. Sheets were dirty. There was also a dead cockroach on the floor.
Heather seems to try very hard to make it a good stay and I appreciate that. There was water, a fridge, a bed, and a bath with a small shower. Nice couch and nice homey touches in the living room area. For the price, it wasn’t bad. It just needs more cleanliness and notification of the area it’s in."

Group trip","We loved our stay st this home. It was very cozy and cute and very homey. It was EXTREMELY CLEAN!!! 10 STARS for cleanliness!!! beds were very comfortable, slept great, big soaking tub in master bath rm. I was excited for a very well stocked kitchen. Pots, pans, appliances, bowls basically anything that you would need to cook. We cooked every day. We only ate out once, and my husband said it was the worst meal we had. My only complaint was that the contact person was out of the country. Evolve did respond to msgs but of course, did not know specifics on the property. There was no trash can outside to put the trash in. I set a trash bag outside thinking someone would respond and tell me where it was, nope. so we did have to pick up trash in the yard the next day. no brooms or vacuums at property to sweep, kinda odd.
But overall it was a great stay"

Master is very large with a queen Beauty Rest bed. (It vibrates and goes up and down for your preferred sleeping position). Bedding in master is white and easily washable. Shower is large with a shower seat and hand-held shower head. Secondary bathroom is clean. Yard is fenced and has grass. Would be good for your pups. Police officer lives on the street, which was a bonus!! Just a couple miles from ENMU. Overall a good experience and would go back when we visit our student athlete at ENMU."

Stayed with a pet","We stayed for three nights, it was easy to get in and out of the house with a personalized pin code for the front door. We were in town for a wedding that I was baking the wedding cake and 200 cupcakes, the kitchen was nice and clean and easy to do all the baking in. The cabinets were stocked with all the kitchen untincles, plates, bowls, cups, measuring cups, and pans. It made it very easy and convenient to do what I needed to do. We had six family members with us and all had a bed to sleep on. The house was very comfortable and a great home away from home to stay at. 9/10 value, as it was a little pricey for the three days but worth the money to have a nice place to stay."

We were informed hours before check in there is no working heat. Night temps were in the 20's. The host did provide portable heaters, but they were either way too hot or they shut off every few hours so you had to turn them back on in the middle of the night. When notified of the issue I contacted the host and they never contacted me back."

The bed was really nice, wifi worked very well, the TV had Netflex to watch, the towels were good quality, and the old fashion bathtub had feet.
Ernestine was a true pleasure to have as a host, and she strived to make our stay as pleasant as possible. She also shared room in her refrigerator for us.
We would definitely stay here again if we come back to the area."

The home is very comfortable and having a private bathroom was very nice as the common areas are shared with other guests. The first guest who was staying while I was there was somewhat messy but after he left the house remained spotless. I was in Portales for a month for school and would absolutely recommend staying here for both long and short term stays.

Stayed with kids","It was great to find a 4 bed room 2 bath home with an outdoor space in a nice and accessible neighborhood. The house is located across from a stadium and the noise and traffic every night was intermittently problematic. Nice if you are going to an event there.
Great two car garage, plenty of parking and big yard.
The house itself is nice enough. The bedrooms could really use a dresser, chair or bedside table. best house feature: electric comfortable living room recliners!!!
The showers took considerable tinkering to figure out the hot water which never got very hot. The kitchen was pretty usable and the keurig had a few, keurig cups. There were a few spices and adequate pots, pans and dishes. Most air bnbs have some toiletry products but the dispensers in bathroom were empty. Hinky door lock. best part: attentive and responsive hosts"

The toilet in the master bathroom ran constantly. The carpets need replacing due to stains. Kitchen has plenty of dishes but no casserole or pans to cook in the oven. Bathroom linens were poor, stained towels and washcloths were like sandpaper. The ice maker did not work (despite turning it on). There were two ironing boards but NO iron. I texted the son who lives next door but never received a response."

Stayed with kids","We were contacted by the homeowner multiple times prior to our arrival, which I’m sure was with good intent, but it was a bit excessive. We encountered plumbing issues soon after arriving to the house. The water in the master bathroom was turned off for some reason and after turning it on the smell of sewage filled the master bedroom. There was also some sort of leak in the main bathroom as the bath mat was soaked with water. We notified the owner who came by as we were out of the house to resolve the issue. Needless to say, we were down to one bathroom until the following day close to noon before it was fixed.
Because of the sewage issues, we were unable to enjoy the backyard as planned. We were offered other options for lodging but decided staying at a house vs hotel just worked better for our family. It would’ve also been a hassle to pack and move everyone out as it was 8pm and our young kids were exhausted and way past bed time. A refund was provided."

Considering we paid both a service fee and a cleaning fee, there is quite an extensive list of “must do’s” for renters before leaving. I certainly understand stripping the beds, wiping down kitchen, trash out, and towels in the washer. I was surprised by the expectation of sweeping the floors, scrubbing the toilet, and cleaning the shower.
Overall, we would recommend but it would be nice to know the expectations up front."

She leaves snacks for you - guestbooks and housebooks and chalk and concrete for the kiddos to have fun.
I can't say enough about how perfect everything was from beginning to end. Tyvvm"

I have very small dogs that have to travel with me and being able to bring them along was the only way I could attend.
The home is located on the corner lot of a very busy street. There is a fair bit of traffic and neighborhood noise. If you’re a light sleeper maybe bring a white noise machine. This is not in the control of the hosts, so not a criticism just informational.
I appreciated being able to stay at this lovely family home. Thank you!"

Great layout of the home and loved it's very private breezeway patio entrance. Our dog loved the huge private fully fenced yard as well. We couldn't have asked more and a TV in family room and each bedroom too! Wifi fast and reliable, as we will miss this home!

Stayed with a pet",This home was well worth the stay and the price! It is absolutely beautiful and so clean. We had 5 guests but there is plenty of space for the maximum number of guest. The home offered everything we needed during our stay and had plenty of driveway and garage space. The neighborhood was very quiet and felt extremely safe. If I ever travel anywhere near this location I will gladly drive out of my way to stay here again!

And the house is immaculately clean. Marcy was very friendly and proactive with communications, too. We travel through Clovis a few times a year and this will be our go to every time."

The grill works fine and the back yard space is great for people with dogs. I stay in a lot of short term rentals regularly for work. I would rate this place at the top of the list. I have only one suggestion... it would be great to have a garage door opener. I would definitely rent again.

First of all, the casita is beautiful: recently updated, and with all the amenities, comfort and space of a cozy home; I would gladly have stayed for more nights. I loved the peaceful courtyard, and how you can see the sun rise on your left and set on your right. What's more, meeting Lynn and John was a real pleasure; I very much appreciated their warmth and insights. I had inquired about their sound experiences, and they were delighted to offer this and show me a range of amazing instruments. We had so much fun making music together! Upon departing, I was amazed how refreshed I felt, especially considering the long drive and work stresses before arriving. A one night stay that exceeded my highest expectations and that was the perfect start to my road trip. Exactly why I love to travel and meet people along the way. Memorable and enriching."
