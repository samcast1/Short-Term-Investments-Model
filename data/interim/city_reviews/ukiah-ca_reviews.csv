Stayed one night",Stayed for a night while visiting town for the weekend and it was perfect! Listing was accurate and actually exceeded my expectations. Since I was planning on being out and about I didn’t need anything fancy…The listing states that it’s not in the necessarily pretty part of town but it wasn’t bad at all! And super close to downtown. Place was clean and cozy. It was nice to be able to use Netflix on the tv and very convenient to be able to use the washer/dryer. I appreciated the coffee and tea that was offered and the water in the fridge. Next time I’m back in Ukiah I will most definitely try to book this place again.

Neighbors trashcan does not have a lid and an animal had spread trash everywhere twice. Not the hosts fault, but the neighborhood is not the best. Still a great value and I would stay here again."

Stayed one night","Pros
- comfy couch
- looks like the listing
- clean aside from smell (I’m a sensitive person so might be just be me?)
- good deal for a group
Cons
- difficult lockbox for key, never seen one like this and the outer part wasn’t connected so once I did manage to unlock it it fell into the neighboring yard so I had to hop the fence to retrieve it, thankfully I’m tall so it wasn’t too bad but also couldn’t manage to put the key back in and lock the lock box upon leaving, so had to lock the key inside when I left.
- weird smell
- squeaky bed (actually woke me up a couple times)
- neighborhood def not nice, which is stated in the listing. But you don’t even want to open the windows which made it feel cave like to me.
- wouldn’t recommend for staying solo although it’s a good deal."

Stayed one night","This was a perfect stay in between wine tasting and exploring the beautiful area! The house has everything you need for your stay, including coffee, utensils, salt and pepper and cleaning supplies. Plenty of dishes and linens. And the neighborhood is very calm and quiet. Don’t know why someone said the neighborhood was sketchy, because it’s not. It’s your typical family neighborhood. Lisa was very helpful and responded right away. And love that check out time is noon time, which is so hard to find elsewhere! Thanks for a wonderful stay, Lisa. Will definitely be back!"

Stayed a few nights","I had a medical procedure that required me to be at the hospital early, to avoid having to get up 2 hrs earlier we stayed here (we are from Ft. Bragg, Ca). Lisa accomodated us with a late check out which allowed me to also recover without driving right after my procedure.
Would stay again, hopefully not for medical reasons."

Stayed one night","This is a tough review to write, but I must be honest. The home was clean and looked like the pictures from the listing. Some problems, but not deal breakers were: no bathroom amenities as listed and not an ideal morning coffee or tea making situation. The big problem was the neighborhood. We had an uneasy feeling turning into the neighborhood and simply felt unsafe. Unfortunately, we left and didn’t stay the night."

Stayed a few nights","This place is fine if you are passing through and need a cheap place to stay. We were here for a couple of days and found it to be a bit drab. It’s very basic, not even a cutting board or can opener in the kitchen. Everything feels cheap - light weight pots and pans, thin cutlery, the towels and rough and scratchy. No bathroom amenities except a used bar of soap. The stickers from Ross are still on the mirror, etc. It kinda felt like we booked it and then they went to Ross to quickly throw together an airbnb. There aren’t many windows in the place and all the walls are white with no artwork. Very bland, basic, neighborhood isn’t very charming either but is close to town. Easy access to freeway.
Bed is comfy but super soft. I don’t prefer this type of mattress and always look for the type of mattress in a review."

Stayed one night","Home was above average give or take. Its location is walking distance to downtown and nearby stores for convenience. Neighborhood is old and has a little charm to this duplex. If your here for work it’s great for in and out and somewhere to place your head for rest and showering up. 2 bedroom with a single bathroom are small, but it has its functions to suffice your needs. Like I said, it’s great for traveling workers and using this home as a base while you’re visiting here in Ukiah. Kitchen is small and has its own flare to its openness to the living room. It’s not a 5 star hotel, but its owner Lisa makes your stay here amazing and everything you’ll need for your stay, and that in itself is a 5 star rating."

Stayed one night","Cute little place! Felt cozy and safe. Loved the washer and dryer access! Beds are ok. I was sad there was no coffee, (I love/need me some coffee in the morning) but I was able to doordash from an amazing local breakfast place, so that was great. The other thing was no shampoo/conditioner which I thought was odd, but not a deal breaker. Overall great stay! The fact it is a two bedroom place made this an amazing deal. Very very clean, and great heater for warmth. I would stay again. Thank you!!"

Stayed a few nights","Firstly, I say this as a compliment: Bill is ""a smart, friendly, professional, warm Big Lebowski"" with a casual, laid-back persona and you can tell he really enjoys making people feel at home - and boy did we! He greeted us warmly in a t-shirt, shorts, and flip-flops and helped us get set. He explained how the (amazingly clear!) TV worked and helped us add some apps. He checked in with us several times to make sure we had everything we needed. It's rare you meet someone like him and that made the experience even better.
The view is amazing. Although there's a lot of construction going on around it, it's invisible to you mostly when you're on the deck with the fantastic view. The place is clean with a ""lived-in"" feel that helps us feel at home. As I stated, the TV's picture was just fantastic! Checking out was easy.
It's a tiny bit confusing finding the place but if you follow his directions, you'll do fine.
Heartily recommend it. Thanks so much Bill for a lovely week."

The place is in the mountains, you have to drive pretty high up hill. Make sure you come during the day time, you'll need to read Bill's instructions pretty well to find it. Once you figure it out, it's easy. Very quiet and peaceful."

Stayed a few nights","We absolutely love this place! It’s our new home away from home. Becca and Wendell have become our new extended family. We loved sharing our day’s adventures with them. They are so much fun to hang out with. Becca stocked the guest house with lots of treats for us. She truly made us feel so welcome. She’s the perfect host. It was right down the street from my son’s house. There’s even a beautiful mockingbird named Peck that we loved to listening to when we had our morning coffee on the balcony. The guest house was fully stocked with all the utensils needed to cook with. She even stocked it with delicious snacks upon our arrival. She is a genuine person who cares about your comfort while visiting. We are looking forward to coming back to this guest house again. This is the best place to stay that was affordable, convenient and comfortable. Becca and Wendell will make you feel right at home!"

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at Poppy's Treehouse was absolute perfection! This place is a complete gem and Becca is an incredibly attentive and helpful host. The apartment itself is spotless and so tastefully decorated with all the amenities you could possibly ask for, including abundant snacks and drinks that make you feel right at home from the get-go. We stayed four nights and didn't use our car once after arriving thanks to the pair of cruiser bikes (+ helmets!) available for guest use, that made rolling to the downtown and nearby parks and hiking trails a breeze. We worked remotely from the apartment for two days and the wifi was as promised, extremely fast and strong. The outdoor courtyard is lovely and it was such a pleasure to sit outside and listen to the birds. Thanks so much, Becca, Wendell and Poppy. We can't wait to come back!"

It had absolutely everything we needed and more. The bed was comfortable, the views of the mountains were gorgeous, and the living area was cozy. We enjoyed having coffee on the quiet balcony and the cherry on top was Becca’s sweet dog who spent some time with us. It was the perfect getaway from NYC life while we attended a wedding nearby. Becca was very responsive which was helpful although we didn’t need much because she already thought of everything. I hope I’ll have a reason to come back!"

Modern and spacious bathroom including a bidet. Lovely neighborhood with beautiful views of the hills and walkable to downtown restaurants. Becca was a great host and provided excellent recommendations for local hiking and brewpubs. We would definitely stay there again. A lovely place."

A master-class in how to design a space to welcome your guests.
We’re now home from our vacation, and along with the sights seen and experiences had, we’re still talking about this wonderful space and all of the sweet little touches.

It was by far the cleanest, most functional and well organized place I’ve stayed since using Airb&b over the year’s. Becca truly hosts with her travelers in mind making sure their every need is considered. She is quick to respond to all communication and we felt well cared for during our stay. Thank you Becca for making our stay a comfortable and memorable one."

Stayed a few nights","This apartment was a joy to retreat in. Becca was super responsive, helpful and generous, and Wendel and the doggy Poppy very pleasant for a quick chat and snuggle, respectively. Little touches were special, like the curated treats Becca left for us, knowing we are gluten free.
About the apartment: perfectly decorated, furnished, and clean. Being brand new helps, but I think it will be wonderful for years and years to come. So many nice touches and accents! The kitchen is AMAZING. Very rare to find an airbnb with high quality appliances, sharp knives, great pots/pans etc. A joy to cook in.
The views from the windows and deck were so relaxing, we enjoyed sitting out there under the shade of the tree in the mornings and reading."

Communication with Becca was super-easy, and she was very accomodating and friendly.

Stayed a few nights","We had a wonderful weekend at Becca’s place. It’s a beautiful space in a sweet, quiet neighborhood. We came for a wedding and had never been to Ukiah before. Staying in Becca’s spot couldn’t have been more perfect to get to know the area. Becca was the perfect host and I wouldn’t be surprised if she becomes a super-host soon. The experience was flawless and you could feel her warmth in the personal touches around the house.
The unit is located just outside of downtown (walkable for us), yet far enough from any noise to feel like you’re on a retreat. We had everything we could need to feel right at home. There were even delicious treats waiting for us on arrival. The furnishings were stylish and comfortable, and the entire unit was spotlessly clean.
Becca was a great communicator and gave us several recommendations for restaurants. We had an incredible, memorable lunch at Jyun Kang at her suggestion.
I can confidently say that you will love your stay here!"

Stayed a few nights","When I stay at a place as fabulous as Becca's I tend to want to keep it a secret so that I can go whenever I want and know it won't be booked. This is a tough secret to keep as I am an honest individual. Becca's place is outstanding. She has a decorator's eye and has paired that with wanting to be a 10-Star host. She has thought of every detail and her space is one I could move into quite comfortably for an extended period of time. It is spacious, well-laid out and every possible detail has been addressed. I loved waking and opening the blackouts for the sunrise. Though it is technically a part of Becca's home I did not hear any footsteps or conversing. Overall exquisite. Thank you, Becca!"

The bed is super comfortable. The kitchen is large and has everything you need for cooking. And the courtyard was so nice to relax in. The apartment felt very private, we never heard any noise and had our own entrance.
Ukiah is a total hidden gem. There is so much to do nearby - wineries, hot springs, lakes, skunk train, etc. We wished we’d stayed longer to explore more of the area.
Becca and Wendell were incredible hosts, communicative, kind, and welcoming. We would love to stay in their place again someday."

The power went out and she sprung into action, equipping us with flashlights and even finding a place with power for us to work remotely the next day. When we returned to the power-on the next night, we were greeted with a beautiful place (that we hadn't seen well in the dark - LOL) - spacious, spotless, and looking out on a garden behind. It's truly lovely."

Pros:
--Clean
--Two bedrooms (one with soft mattress, one with harder mattress)
--Comfy couch for lounging
--Walkable to restaurants/stores
Cons:
--Very strong Glade plug-in scent (we put it outside during our stay ;)
--Kitchen is missing a few things (cutting board, lids for pans)
--No filtered water
--Internet download speed is only 16 mbs
--Small shower with low shower head (good pressure though!)
Overall a good experience though! We would stay here again :)"

There’s so much to do here and downtown is just steps away from the home. If your into wine your definitely in wine country and so much more nearby. Locals are friendly and the ocean is not too far away.
Lisa is an excellent host and cares about her guests needs. If you ask for anything she’ll go out of her way to make it happen or always recommends something else if she can’t fulfill your request.
All in all our visits here are always relaxing and reliable service when and if needed because of the owners love for her property.
Thank you Lisa and look forward to staying here again in the future."

Stayed a few nights","What a delightful little cottage! The description was exactly as listed, and honestly a bit more charming in person. There's a fully stocked kitchen, a comfortable family room area, lots of outdoor space (a deck and a patio area). This place would be ideal for a summer get away, no doubt about it!
You can walk to the downtown area (probably about 15 minutes) and there is every store you could possibly need within a mile or so.
The kitchen was nice and large, and they had all you need in order to prepare food there. They have spices, etc., a coffee maker, toaster and a full size refrigerator/freezer.
The bedrooms were spacious, and the beds very comfortable!! There is 1.5 bathrooms, so everyone must share the full bath for showering. Someone else mentioned in a review that the shower is small - it is! So just be prepared! Otherwise, this is truly a delightful place to spend time to relax and hang with friends and family."

Stayed a few nights","We really enjoyed our stay at Lisa's cozy cottage. It's on a peaceful residential street filled with adorable 1920s bungalows and beautiful craftsman-style homes. And it's only about four blocks to downtown - an easy, flat walk - so we could explore some really great shops, cafes and restaurants. On our first day, we drove out to the coast (which takes roughly an hour and a half on the lovely but winding roads from Ukiah) and checked out the botanical gardens in Fort Bragg. We had some delicious Mexican food at Los Gallitos. The little town of Mendocino is also fun to see; we drove through on our way back. On our second day, we went to Orr Hot Springs, which is only a half-hour away and incredibly relaxing. (You need advance reservations for a day pass to the pools.) Lisa's cottage provided a perfect home-base for our mini-vacation."

We spontaneously decided to head to Ukiah and Lisa's home had availability. She responded very quickly, and was able to work around our spotty phone connectivity. We were so happy to get there, have a hot shower and go out to dinner in this charming little town. Peaceful and walkable. The home is not fancy, but is clean and cute, (the shower is a little small for we tall folks, but that is a very minor note). We would happily stay there again if in the area. Thank you, Lisa!"

As others have said, he shower is very tiny. Another thing I always look for in reviews is what is the bed like. We only slept on one of the two beds, and it was comfortable but note that it is soft. The porch was a relaxing place to sit in the evening as the temperature dropped. Would definitely stay again."

Stayed one night","We loved our stay at Lisa's! Such a lovely, safe, peaceful and quiet neighborhood! The house itself was adorable... clean, spacious, well-lit, and comfortable, with a huge backyard and lots of beautiful flowers and great amenities. Easy parking, a 5-minute walk to downtown Ukiah with some great restaurants (I highly recommend Patrona), and Lisa was excellent in her communication. We really enjoyed the beauty and comfort of her home and the surroundings, and will definitely be back! One thing to note: there are 2 bathrooms in the home, but the only one that has the shower has rather low ceilings. If you are a very tall person (over 6 feet), the shower might not be comfortable for you. The ceilings are high in the rest of the house - it's only that bathroom where they are low. All in all, a fantastic stay!"

I’m not a fan of negative reviews but there was a lot of cobwebs and the floor was pretty dirty. After walking around barefoot my feet were black. The shower is a major issue. Barely any water pressure and I’m not tall but the shower came at my chest height. Pretty much no room to move around. Thermostat is not user friendly at all. Looks like others had issues with it as well. Easy change but hasn’t been done. So much potential in this place that hasn’t been achieved.

The front yard, with a lot of flowers, made my arrival very welcoming. The place was extremely clean. I couldn't figure out how to work the heater but it wasn't very cold and I didn't contact Lisa about it. The ceilings in the full bathroom are very low which could be uncomfortable for people over 6 feet tall but wasn't a problem for me."

Stayed with kids","Our family arrived in Ukiah tired from a morning on the road in the midst of a summer heat wave. What a delight to arrive at this wonderfully air-conditioned, tastefully spare home full of light and space.
While the host informed us on arrival that neither the dishwasher nor the garbage disposal were functional, it did not deter us from enjoying the open kitchen to prepare our meals. We relished the short walk to the historic downtown. While visitors should be prepared for a homeless presence on some streets, we never felt unsafe and even enjoyed taking neighborhood walks during cool mornings.
If there was one area that was a bit unexpected, it was the small shower stall, which had a very low ceiling with a shower exit located directly over an air conditioning vent. I could see some of my taller or larger family members perhaps having trouble using this shower.
Overall, this was a splurge for us and one of our favorite places during a family road trip. The comfortable beds, wonderful central climate control, open kitchen with high end appliances, updated decor and walkable location in the heart of a charming old town made this a terrific place to relax and escape the heat."

The bed was SO comfy and the pillows so nice that I asked where they were purchased. The back patio is lovely once it cools down at night as is the front porch. Lisa was super responsive. I messaged her asking if there was a blue tooth speaker hidden somewhere, there wasn't but she dropped one off on the porch the next day! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and visit with our son who lives nearby."

It's a very private spot, absolutely quiet, beautiful area. Even though it's up on the mountain, it's less than 10 minutes to town (great restaurants, shopping, etc). The bed was very comfortable - we slept great and gently awoke to the sun every morning. No alarm clock required. Chris was very responsive and provided several thoughtful extras throughout our time there. It's perfect for a couple - it's romantic and relaxing. We used it as a home base to explore Mendocino, Anderson Valley, Geyserville, etc. Highly recommend this place!"

We were comfortable, cooked a nice meal, sat by the fire, and snuggled in bed. It was a pristine and lovely little studio cabin, even in the rain. Highly recommend!"

The view and the tranquility of the place was so perfect. We even loved it too when it started raining on one of the nights, therefore we were able to enjoy more our warm coffee the next morning while smelling the fresh smell of rain. When the sky was clear, sipping on hot chocolate while star-gazing was so romantic. If you are feeling lazy and don't want to cook, restaurants/groceries/wineries are mostly within 10 to 20-minute drive. We were also able to hike around the property and say hi to their beautiful, friendly dogs. Will definitely come back again in future!"

Super friendly host and cutest dogs; the nature is breathtaking. I went to Orr hot springs during the day and hiked the most gorgeous redwood trails all on the same street. And while so remote, the town is super close. I ate at In n Out twice, happy camper lol. But made full cooked meals at cabin. Then wine in hot tub… it was unreal. It’s well stocked. I was glad I saw extra blankets. The second night I went to bed early since sun rises outside the big window. I’ll be back again. Thank you Chris for a truly restful weekend."

It's peaceful, quiet, inviting and makes you feel safe to be out in the countryside yet so close to town. Mid-town Ukiah is less than ten minutes away. Airbnb hosts must possess a sense of empathy and an appreciation for their guests' needs to accomplish providing the level of comfort Chris appears to have seemingly effortlessly mastered."

Stayed one night","Chris's log cabin was as awesome as advertised!
The cabin itself was very impressive and extremely clean! The view of the valley was great. The bed was very comfortable. Chris was flexible about our iffy arrival time and made sure our way to the cabin was helpfully lit with string lights. We were even welcomed by cool music from an eclectic radio station.
The bathroom was great. The shower had steady hot water and decent pressure. The stove, fridge, and heater were all awesome. Our cellphones worked fine and were easy to recharge. The work station and Starlink internet connection allowed me to successfully teach an online class with only a couple of minor glitches.
Chris was very responsive about communicating and even let us check out a few minutes late, which really helped make our stay more relaxing.
The only con I can think was very minor. The outdoor grill is small and electric."

The cabin was incredible. So comfortable, quiet, and cool during a heat wave! We went there for a mountain retreat and got the peace and solitude we were hoping for. A big patio area with comfy chairs to stargaze at night as well. There are many walking trails on the property to explore. The views of Lake Mendocino were gorgeous, especially at sunrise. We loved swimming in Lake Mendocino and we found secluded spots to swim at the Russian River just a short drive away! We hope to return one day soon!

Stayed with a pet","There were clear instructions for getting to the right place and it was not hard to find, once you turn in there are lights and signs marking the way and easy entry. The cabin was beautiful! The bed was super comfortable. I barely saw the host but when I did he was warm and friendly. The cabin is super unique. One thing I had a harder time with was the high up east-facing (curtainless) windows- the sun came in pretty intensely in the mornings while sleeping which made it difficult. So bring an eye mask if you are sensitive to light like I am. However the cabin stayed impressively cool with the AC unit, even on the 100 degree days I was there! The bathroom, though compact, is one of the most beautiful I have seen. A peaceful, quiet, view from the porch- lots of trees, and hawks. I hope to return."

Chris has spared no effort or expense to make his place welcoming. From the thoughtfully signed-and-lit entry to the well-appointed kitchen and from the ultra-cozy bed to the sitting area just down the hill (a PERFECT spot for morning coffee to welcome the day), every detail is outstanding. We have stayed with him twice now and the space just keeps getting better!"

Honestly, for the money, you'll be lucky to find such a wonderful place to experience. Don't pass up the chance to stay here. It was truly magical. The interior was exactly what you wanted in a cozy cabin off the grid. whether you're looking to get away for a few days or just passing through for a night, you'll be lucky to book with Chris.
FYI.. I don't write highly rated reviews unless the host absolutely, 100% goes above and beyond what I expected, and the accommodations are immaculate.
Thanks, Chris, for the wonderful set and setting.
Hands down the perfect cabin, it will forever be a destination stop for all my future NorCal road trips.

It is in fact real and a FABULOUS place to stay. The view of the Ukiah valley is better than the photos show, it is quiet and the fireplace is wonderful. Chris had a fire stacked and ready to go so my girlfriend and I spent several hours getting nice and toasty on a chilly night in March. Keep in mind the fireplace may not be available year round due to wildfire concerns. This is definitely one of the nicer places I have stayed. Good vibes!"

Chris was kind enough to give us a tour of his property on his Polaris. So much fun! His property is beautiful and serene.

Stayed with a pet","The cabin was so warm and cozy and the views were so beautiful. Its so quiet and peaceful. You can't even hear the sound of cars. What I really loved was the structure of the cabin. It has amazing insulation and soundproofing. The temperature in the morning got around to 25°F but you couldn't feel it in the cabin. There's also a heater and fireplace if it gets cold which is more than enough. The heater alone warmed up the place in no time. The bed was very comfortable as well. Also, the host sometimes does work on the property but you can't hear any of the machinery from the cabin. Overall, this place was excellent. Definitely coming back again."

Stayed with a pet","What a gem of a find! This was the perfect place for a secluded woodsy, ridge top retreat with expansive views of Ukiah Valley. But it's also a super convenient drive to downtown Ukiah and to nearby hiking trails. The log cabin is much more charming, cozy and spacious in person. We came during the Labor Day weekend, with highs in the upper 90s/low 100s, and the portable A/C and ceiling fans were sufficient to keep my hubby, I, and our two dogs cool. We loved the shaded patio for lounging/lazing around. If you have dogs, just beware of exploring the surrounding property as it's full of burrs this time of year. We will bring dog booties next time (there will be definitely be a next time ;-P ) And as many have noted, Chris is such an attentive and kind host!!"

I was in and out most of the days, trying to tour the area and each time Chris would be outside and wave at me. I was offered a bottle of local wine when I arrived and a lounge chair to look at the IMPECCABLE view, seriously waking up to the sunrise was amazing. The ac unit quickly cools down the entire cabin and I had no problems with being cold at night (I stayed at the end of August). There was even a little lizard, I named him 'Patio Lizard' who would come out when I was relaxing outside and he seemed to be enjoying himself too."

The view at day and night is captivating, the house itself charming and perfectly suited to two, the host welcoming and gracious, and the overall experience is magical. I could literally feel my blood pressure dropping as we parked!
What the posting doesn't capture is wandering outside in the wee hours to enjoy the stars and the light breeze, waking up to a view of the valley through the door that we left open, evenings on the patio with a glass of wine and quite conversation or a good book, and long walks on the property. This is more than a place to stay: it is a salve for the workaday world and a gateway to recovery."

Stayed a few nights","Chris' place is fantastic. Its clean, he has put a lot of thought into making this property feel like a home. The views and stargazing for an astronomy nerd are incredible! You can see up to 30 shooting stars in a night there easily, as well as spectacular meteor showers. Chris is a great and helpful host. I have a bad back and the bed was great. The couch recliner is super comfy too. And the shower has really great intense water pressure, and soft water. The cabin itself is beautiful with huge windows. It is very easy check in as it is well lit, Chris the host has thought about all the details. When you get there he has a bowl of fresh fruits he picked from his organic fruit trees that are growing on the property and a fridge stocked with wine and water and stocked cooking ware too. This host has gone above and beyond. I liked staying here so much during my house hunt that I extended my stay by a few weeks. You will be hard pressed to find a spot this nice in Mendocino county, or a hotel this nice up here."

Stayed one night","Chris's place was great and he was very kind and accommodating. The log cabin is extremely clean and beautifully crafted. Parking is easy (though you must drive up/down a long gravel road and gravel drive to get to the cabin), view is v nice, stargazing was great (there's a switch on right side of porch to turn off outdoor string lights), the patio is really awesome, kitchen was a full kitchen and roomy (though I had difficulty figuring out the stove but it was v cool looking; had I been there longer, I'm sure I would have worked it out) , bathroom was very nice, and bed was comfortable. Though I will say, it's not easy to sleep in late as the big nice windows above and across from the bed laser-ray in some serious sunshine around sunrise (some blinds would be great). It's definitely out of the way and quiet, but near some great natural wonders, hot springs and sights, as well as the town of Ukiah. I had a great short stay and believe it would make a nice longer stay, too."

The cabin is separated from the main house and has it's own porch, driveway and patio space with lots of outdoor space for various activities. There is a heater/AC so the weather outside really has no effect on you. Wifi was super spotty so we barely got reception but if you have other things to keep you preoccupied it shouldn't be too much of a problem. The kitchen was amazing - we cooked on the stove but couldn't figure out how to use the stove because we were afraid to blow it up (it looks vintage but very nice!). ALSO very important - bring bug spray!! Oh, and if you are afraid of spiders or webs, you might want to think twice lol"

What not to say about this place and host? As we enter this cabin, Chris greeted us with beautiful flowers and we felt really special. The bed was really comfortable. The bathroom was designed with stylish marble. The kitchen was stuffed with regular supplies. AND THE MILLION DOLLOR VIEW of mountains, open sky and river. We had such a fantastic date night dinner overlooking stars.
Also, the Main city is merely 5mins drive from the place, so it’s okay even if you can pack less. We would love to come back and stay here for a couple of nights in fall.
Thanks again, Chris for hosting us at your lovely cabin."

Stayed a few nights","I just returned home from a two night stay at the cabin, and the first thing I did was book five more nights in the fall. It was even better than it appears to be in the listing: really clean, fully stocked, many thoughtful touches. Chris even stocks the bathroom with custom branded local artisan soaps and lip balm. Oh! When we arrived, the cabin had been heated up a bit, soft music was playing and there were fresh cut flowers on the table. There wasn’t anything I didn’t love about the place!
Chris was a great host, and easy to communicate with. He greeted us when we arrived and came out to see us off as we were leaving. I look for places that offer privacy, and that is exactly what we found at the cabin. Even though the main house was right behind us, there is fencing with privacy fabric along it, and the cabin is also set a bit down from the main house. I felt like I had more privacy than I’ve had at even more secluded properties. So wonderful and so restful!"

Group trip","listing states the location is non-smoking, however upon arrival the entire house had a strong cigarette smell. This listing had a steep cleaning fee so something like a smell issue should definitely be taken care of. my stay was only for 1 night and due to arriving very late at night I had no alternate choice than to stay. Following the stay I contacted the host about it and basically was turned down in a negative way- host took the stance of the person that cleaned prior to my stay didn't report anything so nothing was wrong. Apparently my concern was fake news!!"

Stayed one night","Decent stay, a bit pricey in our opinion for this particular place. May be reasonable for the area, but not what we were expecting. Just passing thru and arrived after dark, was a last second booking. Host responded very quickly and we appreciated that! The pictures look nice, and the house is clean and decorated nicely, but upon arrival we did expect a bit higher quality in the lodging. The front room sofa needs cleaning or replaced (dirty arms, even the men noticed!), some rugs & carpeting also need cleaning or replaced, the bathroom (near the bedrooms) sink faucet leaks significantly on vanity if not turned off in just the right position, and as another review or two had mentioned, something was beeping and we never figured it out. Not so sure it was the fridge (as mentioned in one review) as we tried to ensure the door was tightly shut and still continued to hear the beeping from time to time. It was fine though, we slept and the beds were clean and very comfortable. Any issues were brought to hosts attention in an email upon checkout, so hopefully some if not all items have been or will be attended to."

Stayed a few nights","This was a nice clean place to stay in Ukiah. The neighborhood was old but seemed okay. The house has a strange set up but good if you have kids. You have to walk through another bedroom to get to the rest of the house then a very small bathroom. The bigger bathroom was in the back of the house by the washer and dryer (separate rooms). The furniture was old but who wants to spend lots of money on a place that strangers will be sleeping. The back TV had a crack or something I. it but there is another TV in the front, if you want to watch it. All and all it was a good value, very clean and Hon was a wonderful host."

Stayed with a pet","Great accommodations, clean and spacious. We like to cook and found the kitchen could use a few additions (needs pot holders, only has 1 oven rack instead of the usual 2, needs mixing bowls and a few more pans), but has basics for cooking. Yard is huge, our dogs were able to run around and play, they were very happy. The big yard gate doesn’t latch though, so we used bungees to secure it for the dogs. We also found a hole in the fence but blocked it either green bin. Beds are all comfy, there were bathroom toiletries available. We mostly hung out in the back seating area with the big couch. There’s a kitchen table with stools but it’s super wobbly so we avoided it and the front room has very little seating, good for a couple folks to pop over to and chat. Back yard has two large picnic tables with an umbrella and a bbq, we ate a couple meals outdoors, had a burger bbq dinner and it was super nice!"

Stayed one night","Unfortunately there was no communication that a skunk had sprayed inside the house until we arrived and saw a hand written note informing us that there had been a skunk. Needless to say we were already aware by the time we saw the note… I’m sure the place would be fine if a skunk hadn’t stayed there before us.
In all seriousness I think communication before hand would have been really helpful and based on the severity of the smell I don’t think it was responsible to host guests."

Stayed a few nights","Hon' place is spacious, clean, cozy and very comfortable. It is very well stocked with everything one needs from the kitchen spices, utensils, dishware, cooking/bakeware, paper towels to the bathroom soap, shampoo, conditioner, razors, toothpaste and body cream. The washer and dryer are a big plus as well and work wonderfully. I notice some reviews mention a beep from the refrigerator. This is because the door is not shut correctly. Once you shut the refrigerator door correctly, then beep is gone. There are two living rooms, each with their own big screen televisions with great picture quality. The backyard is big with a barbeque and fire pit. There is a cottage in the backyard that is also rented out, however the yard is so big, one does not feel squeezed in or uncomfortable. The beds are beyond comfy, and the towels, sheets and comforters are all clean. We were there during the cold weather season and I appreciate how warm the house stayed. We had good friends stay with us and they were just as comfortable and content. There are stores and restaurants less than two blocks away. I had a scheduling conflict that interrupted my booking dates and I appreciate how quick and responsive Hon was with my new date requests, she is understanding and truly a great host. From check in to check out she was always quick and attentive to our needs. I was so comfortable in her home that I hated to leave, and I will definitely stay here again."

Extra points for how comfortable the beds were — we all got a great night’s rest!

It was comfortable, clean, and user friendly. I really enjoyed the foam mattresses. My neck was in a lot of pain on arriving and felt close to normal when leaving. There was a toilet leak that needs attention but we were able to adjust. I am a light sleeper so I was confused on how to solve the random beeping of the refrigertor but it didn't go off all of the time. The neighborhood is quiet despite the cars on the street. I would rent again but hopefully for a reduced amount."

It was incredibly well equipped with plenty of toiletries, towels, bedding, etc. It was super clean and spacious. Parking accomodated two cars length-wise. Beds were SUPER comfortable and had super nice sheets and pillows.
One thing to note is that one of the bedrooms is accessible only through another bedroom. If privacy is a concern, that setup might be a bit weird, but there is still one bedroom that is standard. Closets were big and had plenty of space as well."

Stayed one night","I have stayed in a lot of Airbnb’s and this one had all the items you could ever think of for a weary traveler. I really appreciated how well stocked the home was. Unfortunately I didn’t understand that two of the bedrooms are adjoining, meaning that if you are in the back bedroom you need to walk through the other bedroom to use the bathroom in the night. This wasn’t ideal for traveling with colleagues. Overall it was much better than the other options in this area!"

Stayed a few nights","We founds beds and bedding very comfortable. There were lots of supplies in the bathrooms which was nice. The heat was not working and it was very cold the week we were there, fortunately we were gone most of the time. The front room was pretty and bright as described and shown in the pictures but the back living room had very spotted carpet which seemed to have been cleaned but still full of spots. Just very disappointing.
There is a small house in the back yard that she also rents out as we found out after arriving. Would have been nice to know ahead of time as we awoke one morning to find 8 puppies chasing their mother around the yard. Cute puppies but we thought maybe they had escaped from a neighbours yard. We let Hon know and she said house was rented and the woman told her there would be only two puppies. So that was kind of funny. So I shared my thoughts and comments withHon and she sounded very receptive so Ihope she will make some needed improvements for future renters."

Group trip","Hon is very responsive should any issues arise.
Know this neighborhood looks a little sketchy and there are so many neighbors smoking marijuana constantly that you cannot get away from the smell. Know this is CA and Ukiah that may seem ok but if you have kids or are not used to it, it's very overwhelming.
The house is right off 101 so it is very convenient to get to.
It says it can sleep up to 10 but that includes an air mattress, sleeping on a couch and a very hard ""futon"". The beds in the bedroom are also very low to the ground so keep that in mind if you have issues getting up and down.
Overall it served it's purpose after Hon helped with the issues we encountered."

Stayed about a week","Staying at Hon's place was amazing! The house is clean, stylish, light, spacious, and full of new appliances. Everything is convenient and works well, showers are renovated, and the beds are comfy. We were working during our stay, so we needed fast and reliable internet connection, and we were beyond satisfied with the Wifi at this house - we could have video calls at the same time, while working on a bunch of other things online, and we experienced no hiccups at all. There is even a backup network in case the main one has issues (which we never had).
The windows let in a lot of gorgeous light during the day but especially in the afternoon. We ate breakfasts on the back porch in the yard, surrounded by tall trees and listening to the singing of birds... It felt very private, safe, and quiet. Seriously, everything in the house was super comfortable and pleasant!
Hon's house is located a short drive from dozens of nature hikes, Russian river, and a health food grocery store called Ukiah Natural Foods Co-op, which easily became my favorite supermarket ever!
Hon is a kind and hospitable host - she responded to my messages very quickly and was helpful with every request we had. I would 100% stay at her house again!"

Stayed a few nights","We were visiting my father in Ukiah. Amethyst's place was cozy and just what we needed. It was nearby to his place and we were able to shop for food nearby as well.
The unit was clean and tidy, plenty of space to not have to live out of our bags, and had all the amenities we needed. The private back yard was a real treat as my wife and I were able to just sit and relax and listen to the birds and the breeze in the trees.
Amethyst was very quick to respond to any questions we had and the place was quiet at night.
Definitely book this place if you need a quiet place to stay in Ukiah."

Stayed a few nights","Great little BNB for a weekend stay. We visit family a few times a year in Ukiah and we’ve stayed at some other BNB’s that were less comfortable and more expensive. We didn’t do any cooking or use the kitchen much so we can’t speak to how well equipped it is for a longer stay. However, we appreciated how clean, quiet and private it was. Amethyst was also very friendly, flexible and accommodating.
The only thing I’d mention to help people decide whether or not the place is right for them is the firmness of the mattress. It was definitely comfortable but I have a memory foam topper at home so the bed was a little hard for me. My husband liked it though. We’ll be back if she’ll have us!"

The bed is very comfortable and the bedroom gets really dark, so prepare for some good sleep! Overall the place feels clean and new.
If you are planning on cooking, bring what you need – pans to olive oil. The kitchen is very limited."

I stayed here by myself, but it was clear that it would be a great place for a couple. There's plenty of beautiful, usable, and well-designed space. There's also a lot of natural light. No worries though if you're a late sleeper; the bedroom has room darkening shades (plus the house next door blocks the sun there too). And the bed - the bed was soooo comfortable. I honestly would consider going back to Ukiah *just* to stay at Amethyst's place."

Also the area was so quiet: despite the fact that I am normally a light sleeper, I slept like a baby during my 3 day stay. There was also a nice drip coffee machine (OXO). So if you are particular about your coffee, you can bring your own grinder and beans (I won’t judge you lol) and make your own coffee. Lastly the host Amethyst responded to my questions very quickly. It was a very nice stay!"

Location was five to ten minutes by car from all food, shopping and exploring options. Bed was comfortable. Linens were great. WiFi and TV were good. Security couldn’t be better. It’s easy to find and in a very quiet neighborhood. The place is all new with new appliances. The closet is great and set up for two with rods and suitcase support shelves. The hot water was great. There is a private outdoor sitting area for two. This place is perfect for a couple or single for a night or a week ! We loved it!"

Stayed with a pet","I came up for a bike race in the area, and Cassie's guest house was a perfect place for us to stay. We were able to bring our dog. Cassie's spot is a nice walkable distance to town if you want to walk (~15-20 minutes) and only a few minute by car if you'd rather drive. It's quite peaceful and quiet. Very clean and comfortable, too!
One thing of note - it didn't occur to me to check before booking whether the listing was non-smoking or not. Looks like (at the time of writing) that it's not listed as a non-smoking spot. I mention this because it smelled like a prior guest had smoked at the home. It wasn't super strong, but it's worth noting in case you're sensitive to this. No fault with the listing or Cassie - I could have filtered for this if I had thought about it!"

It is a converted garage, so guests can hear EVERYTHING happening in the owner’s place above, and I assume they could hear me as well. It is very well appointed, internet access is strong, but it was a little small for the price I paid. Parking was on the street.

Once the car is parked on a wide, lightly-trafficked street, you can walk everywhere downtown, for shopping, to visit the Grace Hudson Museum, go to the classic cinema--whatever! My second visit to Mary's place in the fall--after my first in the broiling summer heat--was a homecoming. It will remain my home away from home whenever I return to Ukiah."

There is a nice desk and chair setup for people who plan to work from home. It is in walking distance to the Downtown that has some really good restaurants. There are many good places to explore around the valley Mary takes really good care of guests. Overall, I highly recommend checking out the place if you are looking to have a laid back weekend and staying close to the nature😊"

Stayed a few nights","Mary's ""Penthouse"" studio, above the garage, is a hidden gem! It's in a tranquil corner of the historic heart of Ukiah, set back among lovely Craftsman era houses that are over 100 years old and much loved by their owners. Gardens are a little wild, in keeping with the rustic aesthetic, very charming. It's a short walk to downtown Ukiah and Mary offers a long list of recommended places to eat. The small but well-supplied Westside Renaissance Market is just around the corner. It has a great supply of craft beers and local wines as well as a wide range of home-made salads and ready-to-heat meals. The studio has everything: a fully-equipped kitchen, bathroom with a large walk in shower, and a sweet eating-dining area adjacent to the sleeping area. It was over 100F when I was there, but the A/C cooled things down nicely so I could sleep. Mary is super responsive to questions, and I have already told her I'll be back! Highly recommended."

I was able to make the studio a home base while I helped my mom and did some remote work - the wifi was great, the location is very central, and it's so nice to be working at the desk by the window and occasionally see folks walking their dogs. The studio is set back off the street so it's very private. Bed was so comfy, so many fluffy pillows! And there's a full kitchen with all the amenities you need. There is also a heater/AC with a remote control. Thank you Mary, I really enjoyed the peace, quiet, and comfort during my stay!"

I am a native to NorCal and think Ukiah is one of prettiest little towns, this neighborhood in particular which is great for a walk/run and stroll through downtown. I walked to the Farmers Market on Saturday and to the local Black Oak coffee house (delicious!).
The studio was spotless and had everything I needed -fully stocked kitchen and bathroom, coffee and extra cleaning supplies. The bedding I think is the most comfortable I have ever experienced! And a nice little binder with some personal history about the house and local recommendations.
Mary was a great host! I arrived late after work and she left the porch light on. I was able to enter the studio easily. Super sweet that she had ice cream in the freezer, a nice treat after a long day of work!
I may make this spot a regular visit and will recommend to friends/family that come to the area ! :-) Very grateful for this stay !"

It was such a beauty and peaceful experience the outside shower was the best shower I have ever took the privacy here makes everything 10x better hike to get to the yurt wasn’t too bad only like 6 min but make sure not to make my mistake getting their at night was scary but I love that they have lights down the path which made it easy to find location also bring you’re own propane didn’t read description well so to get to a store is a mission 30 min drive to get anywhere so make sure you’re prepared with propane or food you don’t need to cook. But over all loved the experience from drinking coffee on the bridge in front of the creek to taking a warm shower outside to turning on the indoor bonfire to keep us warm all night just a great experience over all and communication with the host was the best !❤️🥳def recommend.

Stayed a few nights","Super great place! I was at the Sister’s Earthen Yurt and it was super cute and tranquil. There’s a fireplace, although it doesn’t really warm up the room during the winter but it makes the place feel cozy and is convenient if you want to make s’mores. The bedsheets were super warm, comfortable, and cozy for the cold of the winter. The only thing that I was iffy about were 2 of the windows that had no curtains although they were both located in spots where it’d be hard to see through; I just brought some tape and taped up a towel to feel more comfortable. The toilets are located outside and they’re decompostable but honestly they’re not bad, I just wipe down the seat and place down some provided toilet paper and it works fine! The outside shower has warm water and provided soap both for the shower and the outside sink. There are a bunch of trails and a cool treehouse with a hammock to take a nap on. I also love how they provided a bunch of pots, pans, utensils, plates, towels, etc!"

another note make sure y'all check in before dark 🌛😬 safe travels everyone."

Although it rained during our stay, we were able to stay cozy with the fireplace and enjoy the yurt. Finding the yurt when we first arrived was difficult in the dark, but the staff were very helpful throughout our stay."

Stayed a few nights","Love this place it’s very beautiful and would recommend it to anyone. I suggest bringing little luggage and nothing heavy because of the trail to the yurt is a stretch ( 3 flights of stairs ) you can not drive up next to it so keep that in mind when packing, wagon would be highly recommended. Make sure to bring your own lights to navigate the property as it’s very dark and hard to see. Overall most affordable Airbnb I’ve stayed at would try another yurt at this location."

The staff were also really nice. My only issue is that I have some difficulty with my feet and the walk down to my yurt was rough for me, but I did it. Next time I come I'll reserve a unit that is more friendly toward disability which I'm told they have a couple of spots. Worth checking out."

Stayed one night","If you’re looking for a weekend getaway to someplace remote, rustic, beautiful, and quiet you couldn’t find a better spot than this. Adoracion was an attentive and communicative host, the land is expansive with a fun trail that runs through most of it, and there are plenty of spots to rest and recharge. I spent time exploring the dry creek bed, sitting under the quiet gazebo with the wind chime twinkling in the background, and lounging in the hammock two stories up in their adult-sized treehouse. I get the impression that they take immense care and pride in their land and its ability to offer calm. The room itself was minimalist but accommodating, cozy and quaint, with an admirable focus on sustainability and tranquility. Definitely a gem of Ukiah."

It's helpful to read the guidebook before coming so you are prepared and know where everything is beforehand! Adoración was great with communicating.
The road in is a long dirt road, so just be aware :) There's some lovely horses along the way and maybe you’ll get lucky and have some night rabbits guide you home."

I really loved the perks of having a comfortable bed to sleep in, but not having wifi, which is so hard to find these days. Adoration was available but pretty hands off. I will definitely be returning. Pack everything you need in as the drive down the dusty road can be done daily if needed, but it's so nice to just be on the land."

it is a fair hike down from the car, so definitely pack light!"

This was true Glamping with all the comforts you can imagine for this kind of experience in the middle of beautiful nature. We stayed in the Sister's Yurt which was spacious and homey, with tasteful furniture and decor, and with many lovely small touches. This is a true nature stay which may not be for everyone but you know exactly what to expect (amenities, what to do and more) after you read ALL the instructions, which are very thorough, accurate and helpful."

Stayed a few nights","We love staying at our favourite yurt at Golden Cup Widerness in Ukiah. This was our second time visiting, and it was as magical as we remembered! Adoracion, as the management company, are EXCELLENT at communicating with you during the process, and we had some computer issues with our booking and they helped us figure it all out. The camp is absolutely GORGEOUS!!
A few tips:
*Pack light and wear the right shoes! You have to go down a few flights of rocky and steep stairs. I recommend setting aside your hiking shoes just for the descent/ascent
*Lots of lights! Variety is key, flashlights, but also lanterns. if your lanterns are all LED, I recommend bringing something you can throw over the bright lights to provide ambience (we bring silky scarves)
*A cooler! - If you're staying in any yurt except the Big Yurt, you'll want a cooler for keeping your drinks and bigger things cool. The fridge just isn't big enough!"

Overall a good place to stay. A little on the higher end for cost for us.
Unclear about the trash situation. We landed up putting a paper bag in the empty bin and taking that out afterward.
The carbon monoxide and smoke detectors were not installed.
I think it said there was coffee on hand but we never found it.
Otherwise it worked for our short stay.
I appreciate the clean and spacious environment.
Thank you very much for offering us your home.

Had to do some cooking which wasn't the easiest but I wouldn't expect it to be. The tub/ shower is a little tricky. Might not be the best for anyone elderly or handicapped in anyway. My sister has a bad hip and knee. She had a hard time getting out the first night so did not shower again. That was a bit of a surprise but overall we liked the cottage. I had the double bed which was comfortable. The others said the single beds weren't the most comfortable, but acceptable. We moved chair from bedroom to seating area. Could probably use another chair in there. Thanks for having us."

I told the others we have to talk and pretend we are good company. Kris' home was tastefully furnished, clean and had all the basics. The tree lined streets offers excellent shade for my car so none of us suffered 2nd degree burns from the Ukiah sun.
Thanks to Kris' recommendation, we had a great dinner at Oco Time. Their vegan sushi was delicious! All of us loved it more than the protein version. Heck, I told the g/f we will return to Ukiah just to dine at Oco Time.
Overall, I will not hesitate to rent this cottage again and again."

The cottage was easy to find and had easy access. It was extremely clean and comfortable. The artwork and plants were a nice touch. We appreciated the list of things to do and recommended restaurants. We got in later in the day so drove to where we needed to go but it was definitely walkable. The neighborhood was quiet; we had a wonderful relaxing night’s sleep! We enjoyed coffee on the front porch and wished we could have booked a longer stay. Before heading home, we perused a neighbor’s moving sale, then ventured downtown to the Saturday Farmers’ Market and enjoyed a delicious breakfast at Stan’s Maple Cafe. Anyway, I would definitely stay here again ~ we loved it!"

And after waiting 90 minutes to hear back, their response was incredibly inconsiderate because they refused to let us just drop off our luggage early to attend a wedding 15 miles away. We drove 12 hours that day to attend the wedding and hosts were not accommodating at all even though I explained our situation weeks in advance. Place was very cute and very clean. The coffee supplied by hosts is horrible, bring your own coffee also creamer, as none was provided."

Stayed a few nights","This place was cute and exactly as described. my partner and I enjoyed cooking in the kitchen and playing board games at the dining table. I was silly and didn't realize the units in the bedrooms were heaters and ac. But man we got barely any sleep, the main bed was so uncomfortable! It was like a cheap futon mattress on top of a very low bed frame (hard for my 6'5 partner to get in and out of) and the slats did not hold the bed up so we could feel ourselves sinking.
it seems like maybe this Airbnb host has been ""burned"" before by previous occupants since they basically said they would charge you extra if you didn't leave the place as clean as when you got there. If I'm doing all the dishes, wiping down the counters and fridge,picking up all the towels, then why do I pay a cleaning fee?
Overall I think it is a decent value for your money, but honestly I wouldn't recommend staying here more than one night unless you want to be exhausted from the awful bed."

Stayed a few nights","A friend and I stayed at this spot in late August and went to Orr Hot Springs . We weren’t going to spend much time at the Airbnb, so mostly just needed somewhere to sleep, snack, and decompress.
The space is simple, easy to find, and central to anything you need in Ukiah. Kris and Paul were super sweet and responsive if we had any questions and even reached out to let us know they had installed wall air conditioning since we had reached out to pick their brains about fans and what not. The wall air conditioners are located in the bedrooms but cool down the whole space within like 20 minutes. The beds were comfy, bed frames sturdy (for my plus size besties out there) and the pillows fluffy. I would recommend this for anyone."

Stayed about a week","I loved this little place and hope to use it again next time I visit Ukiah. The furniture has been rearranged since the pictures, so there's a lovely open floor space for yoga! Great wifi. Fruit on the trees. Skittish neighborhood cats and somewhere a few houses away there's a rooster who will greet the sunrise each morning! (If you sleep lightly you'll hear him but he's not so noisy you can't roll over and go back to sleep.)
We were having a heat wave, so I was concerned about the lack of air conditioning but Kris's instructions to open all the windows at night and then close them in the morning worked remarkably well, especially since I was gone most of the daytimes. When I was super hot before bedtime, I took a quick, cool bath or shower and did not dry off before going to bed: sorry for TMI but thought others might need that tip!
Enjoyed the restaurant tips. Didn't have enough time for a proper visit to Montgomery Woods but that's on my ""next time, for sure"" list.
Overall, 5 stars. I'll be back if I can."

Stayed a few nights","I found this Airbnb to be a clean and well furnished/decorated place to stay. It was private, spacious, and cute. If you happen to be a female traveling alone, I wouldn't advise walking the mile downtown (/home from downtown) after dark. As far as lack of AC- while the unit will cool down nicely, even on hot days, if you open all the windows, it warms up again by mid-afternoon and will take till around midnight to get back down to a comfortable temperature inside. All this said, I enjoyed my morning runs on the west side of town, and people seemed friendly! This place was also a reasonable distance from Anderson Valley wine region, which was a fun day trip- Husch Vineyards was my favorite, and also recommend Lemons Market in Philo for delicious sandwiches in the back of the shop!"

The wifi was excellent and reliable - totally what I needed for remote work while my house was getting renovated. I stayed for 10 nights and there's enough to do around the area - hikes in the redwoods, hot/warm springs, vineyards, the beautiful coast. Ukiah has lots of groceries and downtown is a walkable distance (a little more than a mile). I appreciated the comfy sofa, the kitchen supplies, and the excellent heaters that really warmed the place up - it was cold and rainy while I was there. I did think the pillows and duvets could've been washed better though and the bathroom sink and tub drained slowly. Besides those small things, this was an excellent place for short and long-term stays. Thanks, Kris!"

Stayed a few nights","This was a perfect place for me. Not overdone but well-stocked. Nice big yard to enjoy the California sun, lots of windows to let the sun in, plenty of room and clean as a whistle. Easy to walk to much of Ukiah. Kris was responsive and graceful. Highly recommended for a long or short stay."

Stayed one night",The house was set back into the backyard which created a very nice private and secluded feel. The house was very clean and had everything that you needed for your stay. The extensive art of the woven baskets in the smaller bedroom left me with a sense of awe and a sense of culture that washed over me like a warm waterfall. Also a good value and I would recommend the house to any guest.

Stayed one night","SO CLEAN!!!!! As soon as you walk in you can smell the freshness of the house. The entire place was immaculate! The bed is very comfortable and we had a great nights sleep. The parking is very convenient and easy. We enjoyed the outdoor space since it was such a beautiful day. The home is well stocked and had everything you could need. Check in was very easy, we were provided a code for the door lock and it was very easy. Great stay! Many hiking trails nearby. Very easy access to downtown and restaurants. Thoroughly enjoyed our short stay."

Stayed one night","This is a fine place to stay in Ukiah. We really enjoyed the standalone cottage, all the little amenities and comforts of home, a nice front porch for relaxing, an efficient living room heater for warming the place quickly, two separate rooms for sleeping. We took a nice walk through the neighborhood and along part of the nearby walking/biking Redwood Trail. The little Ukiah downtown area is delightful...we toured it briefly on our way out of town."

Stayed a few nights",it was a nice little place to crash but would only recommend in cooler months. there was no AC or fans to use. also the shower was dirty and had other peoples hair in it so I had to clean it myself. why charge a cleaning fee if the entire place isn’t going to be cleaned

Stayed about a week","we checked in in a middle if a heatwave. the house does not have air conditioning. We were instructed to open windows and use rotatingdans to cool down over night, close windows in the morning and the house would stay cool. This did not keep the place cool during the afternoon. Early evening it was 83 outside and cooler than in the house. The bathtub/shower is a big step up from the floor, not good for those with limited mobility. The hot/cold regulation for the shower was extremely hot or cold, no in between. My error in not realizing there was no air conditioning when booking, will not make this mistake again. This unit would be okay for a stay when there is not high heat, ie over 90."

Stayed one night","This really is an adorable place! I was at first a little concerned about lack of A/C but I just opened all the windows and put the fan in the bedroom and was fine at night as it cools down in the evening. I felt safe and the neighborhood was quiet. Very conveniently located, cute decor and had everything I needed except I never did find sweetener for coffee/tea and I’m a bit of a Princess I guess when it comes to my coffee haha That is such a small thing and really not worth mentioning but it really is the only thing I could think of that I would’ve liked and to have had. Oh wait, there isn’t a microwave, which isn’t a big deal, but worth mentioning. But there is a kettle and a French press for coffee in the cupboard which was nice!
All in all l have to say a big thank you for a very nice, quick stay on my way down to San Fran!"

Stayed one night",Kris' in-law unit was perfect for our stop in Ukiah on our road trip up north. Kris was graciously accommodating of our later check-in needs. The unit was very nicely furnished and has a lovely remodeled restroom. Pamphlets on attractions and restaurants within the area was a nice touch and very helpful. We really enjoyed our stay!

It’s clean and cozy, conveniently located, it feels secluded but still close to everything. Kris responds super quick and helped us with anything. Just as charming as it looks in the pictures and feels like home the moment you walk in the door. Comes with great tips on local area and suggestions about the city."
