There was enough space, everything was thoughtfully provided and the internet was truly very fast. The location was 30 min away from WGSP and was really close to the Corning Musuem. Their recommendation for 9 Elephants was amazing, we went there twice. Parking was easy and plentiful. Highly recommended!"

Super close to all of the shops and restaurants and the owners are great at responding with tons of suggestions!

The apartment was in a location that allowed easy access to the grocery store, Corning's downtown, Corning Museum of Glass, and highways leading to other towns including Watkins Glen (the famous gorge) and Seneca Lake (wineries and breweries). The apartment was as described and the hosts were friendly and responsive. We bumped into the hosts while checking in and they greeted us warmly, answered a few questions we had, and suggested a few local restaurants and attractions."

Great location, cute and clean apartment with everything you think you may need and more! The host is extremely responsive and helpful, and so is the manager that lives one door down. Everything is within walking distance. The town is absolutely adorable. Must visit Marketplace and visit the local shops. Corning Museum is a few blocks away. 20-30 minutes away from great hiking trails. Watkins Glen State Park is a must-see as well! I am so glad I booked this place and so will you!"

Stayed about a week","We stayed at this place for about a week while waiting for the moving company to move our furniture to town. During our stay, we had to adjust the dates for our trip a couple times. Denise and David responded quickly to our request and were understanding. The check-in check-out process was smooth and great. The little apartment was clean and neat, and was a great size for two of us. Kitchen had many tools for basic cooking. We made a few meals while we were there. I also stayed at the apartment to work at day time as my work is remote. The apartment is comfortable for work, though the car sound was a little distracting if I sat by the window. Overall the place is a great cozy apartment. Denise and David are friendly. We highly recommend this place!"

The kitchen was nice with a water cooler, coffee, tea, and snacks. It had the most adorable mini gas stove. The beds were fantastic! We had a wonderful nights sleep! The bathroom is small but the water pressure and temperature was awesome.
Robert himself is responsive and accommodating. The price is a little above what I normally go for. We were splurging on a girls trip to corning. I would absolutely rent from Robert in the future."

Anyone having the opportunity to stay at his property will be treated to a very pleasant and comfortable visit as a result of his attentiveness to details and desire to accommodate guests.
The apartment was decorated very tastefully. Linens, towels, kitchen items were all new and neatly organized. There were snacks, coffee, laundry supplies and even a bottled water dispenser.
Only regret was I had to leave unexpectedly half way though the stay and unable to enjoy his hospitality a little longer."

Stayed with kids","The apartment was clean and in a great location (walkable to the town). Pictures and description were accurate. When booking I had asked Robert about air conditioning since we were traveling with a baby. He was upfront that there was none, but stated the apartment typically stayed cool and had fans. Unfortunately, it did get very hot in the evening (85 degrees). A few of the windows did not have screens and were unable to be opened which added to the intense heat. I made Robert aware, but understood there was not much he could do at that point. He was responsive and apologetic - he indicated he would look into it for future bookings.
That being said, aside from the sweltering heat, it was a cute and clean place in a convenient location. I would not hesitate to rebook in the cooler months (or if air condition was installed for the summer months)."

The location was easy to get to, and Robert left us a bowl of snacks and bottles of water, which were very welcome after a long day. It was my fault for not reading more closely that there was not an AC in the unit, but the fans were great at keeping the air circulating. We look forward to stopping by in the future when we need a place to overnight in the area."

We really enjoyed reading about the history of the house and the local recommendations. As others noted you do have to walk up a couple flights of stairs, as it’s on the third floor, but very comfortable stay. Pay attention to the city parking regulations (helpful diagram also posted) Pristine towels and linens and comfy beds."

Also being an old house insulation is tough to deal with so it gets very hot in the summer however they battle that with A/C units in every room that work very well. In theory it’s walkable to downtown but it’s on a hill so it’s a workout getting back. All in all a fantastic stay.

The kitchen was well supplied, and we cooked many dinners in - definitely check out Butchers Son at the Wegman's end of Market St. Being from the land of ranch houses and central air we had some trouble managing the summer temperature of the third floor. The beds are pretty soft so be aware if you need a firm mattress. The hosts we good about texting when they wanted to pick up the trash or wash towels and were very unobtrusive. The switching of parking from one side of the street every day was weird for us Southerners - we did see someone who got a ticket. At least in Watkins Glen it is sensibly limited to Nov-Mar!"

Stayed with kids","Our small group (three adults and an infant) had a great time exploring the Finger Lakes on a recent weeklong stay at this historic apartment in Corning. It’s a bit further driving out to the wineries and parks for hiking, but the spacious, comfortable and well-appointed apartment more than made up for it. The small town of Corning was also nice to explore in its own right - several solid dining options in the Gaffer district, a nice small farmers market on Thursday, and the local Wegmans has everything you could possibly need. And definitely check out the glass museum.
The apartment is the top floor of the historic house in which the family resides, but it’s a separate entrance and it all feels very private. We cooked several meals in the well-equipped kitchen and there were plenty of extra towels and toiletries available (plus some bottled water and snacks). Frances was very quick to respond and helped coordinate some special requests (regarding kitchen equipment and some infant care items). It is a third floor walk-up and larger groups should note the single bathroom, but we can’t but fully recommend this apartment. Thanks for hosting us, we would definitely stay again!"

It worked perfectly for two families with three young kids— plenty of bedrooms and sleeping options, a kid gate for the top of the stairs, a nice selection of children’s books, and great views from the top-floor windows. Great location (perfect for visiting the CMoG) and we’d love to stay here again!"

It is in the top floor of a Victorian home on a quiet street yet close to downtown Corning and exhibits all the charming features of that era building. From the comfy couches in the living area and the nice sized table to the roomy bedrooms, each with its own particular charm (our granddaughter loved the circular room - she felt like a princess!) and very comfortable beds to the games, DVDs and foosball table we were well occupied. The kitchen and bathroom were well stocked with all the necessaries as well as thoughtful extras -- snacks and candy and toiletries. Our hostess was welcoming, responsive and informative. A great experience!"

Stayed one night","The house is in a great downtown location. It's a steep walk down (and up) the hill to Market Street shopping and restaurants, but easily done for our group. The guest suite has many comfortable beds, but only one bathroom. (Very comfortable for 3-5 people.) The home is as you'd expect from a historic home, some uneven floors and such, but is very well kept, clean, and tastefully decorated. The kitchen is not eat-in; you have to carry your food to a table in the living room, but this is no big deal. Lots of instructions for operation and finding things, and the host is available for any questions . She even offered to pick us up from downtown, which we didn't need, but it was a very kind offer. Would definitely stay again."

Stayed a few nights","Angela’s apartment is exceptional in every way, and she is a welcoming host! Check-in was easy, and the snacks and water upon arrival were welcomed since we had a long day and didn’t have a chance to get to the grocery store until the next day. Beyond that, Angela’s apartment provided everything we would have expected and more. She doesn’t skimp on towels and bedding, and if anyone in your group is especially tall, they won’t have to duck to get under the shower head…it’s the little things. Angela even provides basic toiletries which was a nice touch. Her space was the perfect landing each day of our stay. We even made a fire in the ring late one afternoon. We chose her place because we were spending 2 days at Corning Glass Museum and 2 days hiking at Watkins Glen and Buttermilk Falls before continuing on to Niagara Falls at the end of our stay. I highly recommend Angela’s apartment if you plan to be in the Corning/Watkins Glen area."

Stayed a few nights","The Loft is lovely - modern, bright and sparkling clean (probably the cleanest AirBnB I've ever encountered), with thoughtful little touches and attractive decor. Angela and Josh were attentive and very responsive hosts, and the keypad access couldn't be easier.
Although there is a large fridge, toaster, microwave and oven, it would be a challenge to cook more than an omelet given the available pots, pans, & bowls. However, there are a variety of nice restaurants in Corning and a big Wegman's in town where you can buy tasty ready-made dinners to eat at ""home."" It's a quick ten minutes into town, so great on location.
As of early April, most of the land surrounding The Loft has been dug up by large machinery. The trees were all pulled out and it's bare, torn-up land all around. If you're just interested in interiors, then two-thumbs for certain! If you wanted to sit on the little porch and enjoy nature, then not so much..."

The loft cottage was cozy, comfy, and private, which is great when traveling with a dog. The cottage was decorated, so you feel like you are at home. The furniture & bed were very comfortable, & the cottage comes with a variety of lighting options where you could make it bright for a workspace or quaint for relaxing. There are two flatscreens with many viewing options. I loved the wall fireplace insert that offered both heat and lighting colors for mood and ambiance. Angela provides everything you need in the kitchen and bath with quality products as well as a washer & drier if needed. I look forward to staying again & seeing how the yard renovations turn out. The location is great & only a few minutes from Market Street in Corning as well as a short drive to Watkins Glen. I was very happy with my experience as was my pup! :) Many thanks to Angela for getting us in last minute."

The bedroom was spacious, the bathroom cute and clean and the kitchen was great.
Every time we went out and then came back in, it felt like we were returning to a wonderful sanctuary away from home.
Also......Angela and Josh were great hosts. We had several questions when we were first settling in and every question was answered. Coffee pods were getting low so more were delivered to our door.

We traveled 5 hours away and when we arrived the place was lit and we felt instantly comfortable - its a bit secluded and surrounded by woods. Stayed here with my two children and we all loved it. I will absolutely stay here again!

Stayed a few nights","Angie & Josh were absolutely amazing, beautiful, and excellent hosts!! Brent & I stayed for 3 nights & 4 days & felt right at home!! The bed was absolutely comfortable, especially for Brent being 6""11. I brought my service dog & he was absolutely loved & spoiled with pets & love by Angie, Josh, and the neighbors!! It's all around a very comfortable & beautiful home!! There was a really good amount of storage space as well as different things to do inside of the house such as board games, puzzles, video games on TV in the living room, music, as well as snacks when we 1st checked in. Anytime we're in the Corning area, we will definitely stay here just about every time because we felt more comfortable & more like a family here than any hotel we could've stayed at!! Such a loving & cozy place to stay for sure 110% would recommend🥰😇"

Last time we stayed in a house that was less than a mile from Market Street, but staying in this unit right ON Market Street was so much nicer! Super easy to walk to shops and restaurants, and the apartment was a great hangout space. Will definitely keep this unit on our list for future visits!"

Stayed a few nights","We echo all of the previous reviews of Kathryn's great place. It's a fantastic location in a lovely little town. Great restaurants and bars right outside your door, easy access to the Corning Glass Museum, and lots of fun day trips throughout the Finger Lakes region for hiking, wine tasting, or any number of festivals and farmer's markets. Highly recommended is the Glenn Curtiss Museum in Hammondsport if you enjoy the history of flying and motorcycles.
Parking was mildly confusing at first, but there's plenty of easy parking right behind the property in a city lot. You just have to remember to pay for weekdays between 9-5, but it's very affordable. Highly recommended!"

Apartment was super clean and we appreciated the snacks. Close to the glass museum and Watkins Glen.
Parking in the evenings and weekends is free in the back lot, which worked out perfectly for us as we arrived at 5 pm (when the fee for parking ends) on Friday night. The parking lot does get very busy after that, so walking around town is highly recommended to keep your spot.
The pool table was a nice touch and was a fun activity to wind down the night."

Apartment was very spacious, clean and comfortable. Bathroom was well stocked with salon shampoo, conditioner and many clean towels. Washer and dryer were welcome as well. Parking was easy during Christmas holiday but was a bit more challenging as town came back online especially during peak times in the evening (5-7pm) though was always able to find a spot with some looking. Overall a wonderful spot, would be a great place to bring few friends to hang out for a weekend, pool table in the apartment and many walkable restaurants would make for a great spot."

Kathryn is a great host and there were many thoughtful touches throughout (e.g., fresh flowers, snacks, coffee, professional shampoo/conditioner, etc.). There isn't much seating beyond the sofa, so make sure that works for you. Also, there is no microwave (which we could have used to heat up the awesome mac-n-cheese from Mooney's!), but the full size oven did the trick. Location is so convenient! Aniello's pizza and Dippity Do Dahs homemade ice cream are a definite must. :)"

For a price that was only a bit higher than getting a hotel, we had a much bigger and more beautiful residential space with the best of both words--right in the historic part of town with tons of shops, and an easy walk to the Corning Glassworks. Downtime was easy with entertainment easy to stream in master bedroom or common living area. This lofty space is welcoming and it is quality, there isn't that underlying blandness some rental spaces can have. The space was perfect for our family (our kids are older, 10 and 13, so we've long outgrown worries about stairs and ladders). Totally the right call."

It was in the heart of downtown, within walking distance of EVERYTHING I had planned that weekend:) Kathryn was so kind and easy to get ahold of, we had some issues getting back in our first night after dinner, and she answered right away and was able to come and meet us immediately. Luckily we were able to figure out the door, it was just really jammed and us apparently too weak lol Looking forward to booking this place again in the future! Thanks again Kathryn!"

It’s a great location on a quaint Main Street with lots of restaurants and shops right downstairs. It was clean and well stocked. Great amenities with the fun pool table, unique and comfy Murphy beds and great water pressure in the shower. I would definitely stay here again if ever back in the area. And the host was really helpful and available for any questions."

Only drawback this time was we had very noisy upstairs renters this time around. Not anyone’s fault. Between kids crying and dogs barking and then the adults yelling over everyone it wasn’t as peaceful this time around. Again not anyone else’s fault, and won’t deter me from renting this place again and again!!

Stayed a few nights","The Airbnb was very nice. We enjoyed our stay
It was clean but not as immaculate as other reviewers mentioned. There are some stained towels that should be replaced. . The unit smelled of a
strong cleaning product and there was a lot of soap residue on the floor and surfaces which caused them to be sticky. The owner offered to send his cleaning crew in to fix it but they didn’t have Masks and he doesn’t provide
them with any so we declined his offer and cleaned up the best we could. The kitchen has a full size refrigerator and stove. There is a bunch of mismatched plates and glasses and silverware much of which is heavily tarnished. We stayed August 2022 and there was extensive street construction which started every week day at about 7:15am. The beeping and drilling etc woke us. Overall a very nice but not exceptional stay."

Don contacted us the day before letting us know that something had broken but he made immediate accommodations and came in to fix it as soon as possible. Don, himself, is a great guy. Someone I would like to have as a neighbor. He recommended a few places for us to visit and see in our brief stay.

Stayed with kids","Don's home offered the perfect base for our family of four (with two kids, 3.5 and 5.5) to enjoy the finger lakes area.
The house is lovely, super clean and really nicely decorated. Both bedrooms were comfy and inviting, the kitchen fully furnished, the bathroom large and comfortable. Don adds a ton of great amenities from toiletries to smart tvs and an Alexa speaker in the hallway, and having a washer and dryer was also very nice. Adjacent parking behind the house or in the street.
Check in/out and communication: electronic lock codes sent the day before, Don was very responsive by email and regularly checked in with us to make sure all is well.
location: The neighborhood is quiet and feels safe, a 3 minutes walk to the glass museum and also really close to central market street with restaurants and some shopping, a large Wegmans is also near by if you feel like grocery shopping and cooking.
In summary, a great stay and much preferable to pricey area inn/motels in terms of comfort and value. we'd be happy to come back."

Three areas ensuring elimination of any viewing arguments!!!! The location is quiet and lovely, but. Lose to
Everything! We even did an afternoon of wineries! Even though our daughter has graduated I love the area and am a runner and may come back for the wineglass marathon, even though I have already done it once. Don was a very attentive host who made sure our stay was seamless. Fabulous communicator and great digs. Highly recommend! Thank yiu!"

A short 5-minute walk to the Museum of Glass and a 20-minute walk to all local coffee shops and lovely restaurants that Corning has to offer. Our host communicated very well and clearly and we always felt he was at the end of a phone. Thanks for a lovely stay in Corning!"

Bonus was that the town itself is small enough that we could easily walk to the Gaffer District for dinners and some gift shop/antique browsing for the two nights that we stayed.
The apartment itself was very clean, bright, relaxing and spacious. It fit our needs as a family of four very well. TVs in both bedrooms, and the living room let everyone choose their watching pleasure. Lots of good natural light. The kitchen was functional for breakfasts/lunch prep, but we ate our other meals out. We did not use the washer, but were happy to have a dryer for our jeans & jackets after we got caught in a downpour. Altogether, a great stay!"

Stayed a few nights","The Gorton Residence is so convenient to everything in downtown Corning. Perfectly located on a quiet residential street only minutes from the Corning Museum of Glass. The home is stylishly decorated and very comfortable. We had two couples (4 ppl total) stay for a long weekend and we had everything we needed!
I was especially impressed by how immaculate the home was upon arrival. This should be a given but Don goes above and beyond. Everything was spotless and linens and towels smelled fresh. The additional little touches he added (items to accompany the coffee bar, Brita full with fresh water in the fridge, lovely scented soaps, and cleaning products) were so thoughtful and appreciated.
Parking was easy and clearly communicated re: street parking as we had two vehicles in our party.
Don was an excellent host; offering a link to his detailed guidebook with fantastic recommendations for food and activities. We tried several of his restaurant and bakery/coffee suggestions, which did not disappoint. We spent a few hours at the Museum of Glass (a must experience!) and hiked local Watkins Glen. Don was extremely friendly and responsive; ready to help as needed.
If you find yourself considering a visit to Corning; stay at Don’s! It was truly lovely; and a real gem in the area. We look forward to a return trip."

Don’s place is bright and cheerful and spotlessly clean, and everything there - mattresses, sheets, pillows, lighting, security, towels, shower head, even toilet tissue - is the highest quality. There are lots of thoughtful touches throughout the home.
The Corning Museum of Glass, a great wine shop, a brewery, and several restaurants are within a few blocks, and right across a charming bridge is a full grocery store, plus shops, taverns, and more restaurants. Don provides lots of information about local things to do, and is always available if you have questions.

The apartment is lovely, stylish, with considerate and cool touches everywhere. I kept photographing different rooms to get decorating tips to incorporate back home.
Everything was immaculately clean, always important, but never more so than now.
Don checked in on us regularly to see how we were faring, and gave suggestions how to improve our experience.
The apartment was perfectly located, easy to get to everywhere we wanted. Close to the highway, but quiet And peaceful. We loved coming back to it at the end of each eventful day.

We also enjoyed sitting on the front porch, taking walks and visiting with neighbors.
Don was attentive to our needs and more than willing to make our stay as comfortable as possible. I have high regard for good communication and Don was an excellent communicator and followed through quickly when a question was asked or a request was made.
We will definitely make Don's place our first choice for future stays!"

Stayed one night","Easy check-in and instructions. The apartment was exactly as pictured. We were welcomed by a nice warm apartment, that was clean. The linens were obviously freshly laundered, something I find you don’t always get at other Air BnB locations. Anything we could have needed was provided, as well as a binder full of local suggestions and instructions for parking, etc to help our stay. One minor draw back for me was the outside path did not have a handrail and there were steps leading to the home. I have limited mobility in one leg, so that is something to keep in mind. When I stay here I again, I will bring my cane to assist the walk. But definitely not enough of a drawback to effect a five star rating or recommendation for others to choose this location. Our host was very responsive with questions and our stay quite comfortable. We would stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","I stayed July 11-16.This quiet, residential, 2nd-floor AirBnB is located an easy 15-20 min walk via the Centerway bridge to the Corning Museum, maybe a 5-min walk to the Gaffer District, and 5-min drive to the Wegman's grocery store. I also used this AirBnB as my base to go visit the Gorge Trail - Watkins Glen and Keuka Outlet Trail.
The weather was hot and humid so I really appreciated the window ACs in the bedroom as well as the livingroom, which has also a ceiling fan.
As a solo traveler, I did not go out to restaurants. Rather, I used the well-lit and functional kitchen for my meals. I used the gas cook-top, microwave, and fridge - no real issues. (Did not use the toaster.)
Comfy bed. I always travel with my own pillow but the pillows looked good. The room has a side-table lamp and a ceiling light. I would like a less bright lamp bulb as I am winding down my day - but that is just my personal style.
Shower head gives a great spray & do not have to wait long for the hot water."

Stayed one night","The cozy apartment is located within walking distance of Corning’s Market Street area that has numerous shops and restaurants. We enjoyed a great meal at Slamming Jammin Bar-b-cue. We like Bar-b-cue a lot and this is some of the best we’ve ever had. It was moist and flavorful and portions were very generous. Mike pointed us toward this are when we inquired about general recommendations for restaurants and said it offered many good options. He was right! It is also close to the Corning Glass Museum and only a 20 minute drive from Watkins Glen which was our destination for Sunday.
Everything in the apartment was clean and comfortable. We were a little concerned when we noticed there was no onsite parking available but there is plenty of street parking ad vacant parking lot across the street that has no posted restrictions so we needn’t have worried about that at all!
Thanks Mike for sharing this great little place, we’ d definitely keep in mind for future visits in this area."

Room was clean and welcoming.. absolutely everything you would need/want for a trip to the lovely town of Corning. I loved being able to walk to the center of town where the bars and restaurants are and the surrounding neighborhood is friendly and beautiful. I was taking a class at Corning glass so it was maybe a 5 min drive to the studio’s which made the morning commute very easy. I highly recommend this apartment because it really did have it all. Thank you Mike!

Stayed one night","We came down from Rochester NY looking for a possible place to retire to and needed a place to stay while checking out the various neighborhoods. This place worked out really well for us. It wasn’t very expensive, but was well kept up and satisfied all our needs. Very comfortable and quiet. It has all the amenities you would find at a 5 star hotel suite (TV, sink, stove, microwave, full size refrigerator, coffee maker and coffee), but at a much lower cost. There is also a door to the bedroom so you can still use the main room while someone is trying to sleep. Ok, so maybe the TV screen is a little smaller than you might find at the Hilton, but who cares? How many hotel suites include a gas stove with oven? Worked out perfectly for us. Mike was a responsive host and the check-in / check-out process was seamless."

In the interests of transparency, i have to mention that unfortunately we didn't have a good check in experience and had to contact airbnb to contact the host (after failing to contact him ourselves).

Stayed one night","Good budget-friendly choice for Corning. Mike was super responsive.
Pros: Walking distance from the Museum of Glass. Cornell restaurants and shopping are across the river, about a 4-minute drive. Clean and spacious. Well-equipped kitchen, full-size fridge, comfy beds.
Cons: HVAC system is noisy. You notice when it goes on. 2-hour parking right in front. You need to find a spot around the corner for overnight. Bathroom feels a bit dated, but good water pressure. Building is shared, so you occasionally hear muffled voices from next door."

A storm hit while I was there and a window leaked. Mike responded immediately when I messaged him.
If I’m in the area again, I’d definitely stay again. Thanks Mike!"

I can say that arriving after 10 PM was not a concern at all because the lighting was outstanding making lockbox access and entry very safe.
I was traveling with my dogs and found the neighborhood to be extremally walkable and very safe as well with schools and churches in close proximity.
The interior of the apartment is just as described and I definitely appreciated Mike providing the makings for morning coffee. The apartment is tastefully decorated and would be a great home base for exploring the area. I will definitely add this apartment to my repeat stays list."

The apartment itself has everything you might need, though we didn’t make much use of the kitchen.
Note that the windows in the living room let in light but aren’t transparent and don’t open to let fresh air in. However the window air conditioner in the bedroom and the floor unit in the living room kept things comfortable.
It was a good place to stay for our short visit to the Southern Tier & Finger Lakes region of NY. Thank you Mike!"

Mallory was easily accessible with good communication.
Parking was a bit confusing at first. Read the signs and look at Mallory’s instructions. We parked overnight in the public lot just around the corner.
We were there on a weekend and there was some late night noises from people going home from the local bars, I am a light sleeper so wore ear plugs and couldn’t hear it after that. This was the perfect place to stay for our visit. 5 star accommodations!!"

Our visit felt like visiting a “Hallmark” town. The neighbors were super friendly! Minutes away from town with lots of options to take a stroll with your four legged bestie! Loved the fenced in backyard! Was perfect for our Lab!
Easy drive to the Finger Lakes and local attractions! Would highly recommend!!!
We hope to visit again soon! Thank you Cindy for your wonderful accommodations!"

I used to live in Corning, so it was awesome to be on the Northside so close to what was Northside Blodgett (I can't believe it's gone!) and walking distance to Wegmans and Market Street (It's about 0.8 miles away which is walkable for me). I was able to walk my dog around the neighborhood and by the homes of friends where I used to hangout. A great place to stay and a great location!"

The kitchen was small, but well stocked with baking supplies. The three of us enjoyed sitting at the little table and eating together.
This house sits on a hill, providing a great view of the neighborhood. There was some snow and ice while we were there, and we were grateful that the sidewalk and steps had been salted. For anyone with mobility issues the stairs and sidewalk could be difficult to navigate safely due to the uneven terrain.
The TV and wifi served us well. There were plenty of streaming services available.
The house was cozy and clean and we plan to return."

Stayed with kids","The picture of the backyard catched my eyes when I searched for for a house in Airbnb, but it was the biggest disappointment - instead of what I imagined as an isolated and calm place, turned to be dirty, untreated and in proximety to other houses. A huge spider even came to visit in the bathroom. In addition, I was afraid to use the washing machine, that seems a bit old & full with limestone and there was no dish dryer to place the washed dishes.
Other then that, Lucas is a wonderful host, he turned the AC and the fans ON before we arrived, the commiunication was great, he even gave us a great tip for breakfast and there is a Roku for the TV that preloaded with Netflix and YouTube TV, that was a great bonus.
Overall I think that this house is a good option to consider, when staying in Corning and although the negative issues that I wrote I'm not sure that the other hosting options in the city, at this price level, are better"

We had towels and places to hang them, a coffee maker that was easy to use with plenty of coffee and creamers available. There is a washer and dryer which always is a plus in my book. Also, the master bedroom has a tv in it for evenings when you feel really lazy! We were there during some cold rainy weather and had a great day visiting the Corning Glass museum and coming back with friends and turning on the little electric fireplace. All in all a very pleasant stay."

The space was perfect for what we needed and provided the exact amount of home-comforts as well as being centrally located to everywhere we could need to get to. On top of that, there was disinfectant cleaner available, which is so important to us during these COVID times - it really made us feel that the extra care & thought was put into our safety and well-being.

Stayed one night","Such a perfect little place for a couple or two to spend to see the sights. We met my cousins from NY (we from Phila) for a trip to the Corning Museum. Lucas' house is literally minutes away. Perfect home away from home, with everything needed to make you feel at home! From the keurig in the kitchen to the roku for the tv, its the little comforts! Definitely coming back for a longer stay to check out all that Corning has to offer. Cute town. Lucas even texted me in the morning about a great brunch going on in town!! Great hosts!!"

It’s beautifully decorated, the beds are super comfy and it is the most well appointed airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. There were so many snacks, fresh fruit, s’mores kits, milk choices for coffee and cereal. We were able to walk to downtown to enjoy GlassFest and the many wonderful shops and restaurants. I can’t adequately express how amazing this place truly is! I hope we will be able to return for another visit in the future."

Before arriving, I asked for specific items and he was swift to contact his housekeeping staff to arrange for those items to be present and ready for my use! We would absolutely stay here again. Thank you Don!"

This was our first time visiting Corning and everything we wanted to do was within an easy walk. We explored the glass museum … it’s quite impressive! While walking on Market Street one morning, we noticed a farmers market … what a nice surprise … delicious donuts! Great shops too … check out Crystal City Olive Oil and the CD Cafe.
We would definitely stay at Don’s place again and highly recommend it to anyone visiting the area!"

I took a class at the Corning Museum of Glass and was able to walk there everyday. Additionally, as a host, Don was incredibly communicative, professional, and caring. He was very quick to answer and solve any troubles throughout our lengthy stay. We had last minute issues with our car that prevented us from leaving when planned.

Stayed with kids","This apartment was the perfect weekend stay. It was an exceptionally clean and cozy place for a weekend getaway to celebrate our anniversary. The apartment had a warm and welcome feel to it the moment you walked in the door. Don was great, checking in with us several times asking if everything was going well and if we needed anything. He even went above and beyond and dropped off a bottle of wine for us. We couldn't have asked for a better stay."

Stayed a few nights","Don's place is a perfect home base for anything you might be doing in the area. Corning's Gaffer district is about 5 minutes by car. Watkins Glen was about a quick 30 minute drive. Don pays extra attention to keeping everything sparkling clean, the decor was chic and cute. Loved having our coffee and snacks on the deck. It is super private even though it's in the middle of a neighborhood. Don's communication is outstanding. If I could give 10 stars for each category, I would."

Stayed a few nights","Don's place is a perfect spot for couples visiting corning. We enjoyed almost breakfast and dinners in the wonderful balcony. The balcony dinner lights give a nice touch under a starry night. The kitchen was fully furnished for our needs, we enjoyed making a few meals here.
Don's place is quite close (walkable) to the corning downtown and the glass museum.
Don's place has a welcoming and cozy feel. The decore in the bedroom makes it a perfect place to relax. Also, the double washrooms are a bonus.
We also had a chance to see the calm room at Don's house. Although, we didn't have time to enjoy that it is a perfect place for people planning a relaxing at home stay with a truly calming atmosphere to relax, work, or exercise (it has a well equiped yoga room).
Don was a wonderful host and was very quick to respond to our questions and help during the check-in. We also greatly enjoyed a little surprise he left for us at our door 😀
I would highly recommend this place for people visiting Corning. You can also visit Corning just to visit Don's place 😀"

Indoor, and especially the outdoor space was great! So close to the Corning Museum of Glass, Gaffer District, as well as Watkins Glen and Hammondsport. Important note: washer dryer combo was not as efficient as we were hoping it would be."

Stayed a few nights","This apartment is THE place to stay if you are planning a visit to the Corning Museum of Glass, which is a five minute walk away. You can also walk to the Gaffers District to shop or eat at one of the several good restaurants. There is a microbrewery three blocks down the street - the Iron Flamingo - with terrific beers, outdoor seating and food trucks. The apartment is clean and spacious for two people. It’s in a quiet, residential neighborhood and it was great to make breakfast or lunch in the kitchen and eat outdoors on the porch. There was good water pressure, hot water and heat, and the bed and living room couch were both comfy with Roku set up TVs in both rooms. Don is a tremendous host, extremely responsive and gracious. Five stars for sure!!"

In such challenging times of renting a space, he was able to explain the current cleaning protocol in detail which made me feel at ease. Upon arrival, you could see how clean the space was and it smelled like fresh cleaning products (not in an overpowering way but evident that cleanliness is of concern). The decor was modern and fun, a cozy and cool place to be. Thank you Don!"
