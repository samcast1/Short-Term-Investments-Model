There is a nice home theatre along with board games and puzzles. Linens are incredibly comfortable. This being my first time using airbnb is better than expected. I felt safe in the space and in the area. The Mediterranean Italian restaurant listed in her recommendations is incredible and affordable. An extra star if I could for Karan playing Taylor Swift music for my friend and I as I mentioned we were heading to Cincinnati to see her. I couldn’t recommend this space more :)"

The entire space is spectacular and everything is very well thought out and high end. Karen kept the pool warm, which was nice because it was in the 70s during our stay. We had kids with us and they also loved the tree house and swing set."

Stayed a few nights","We cannot say enough about this wonderful place that amazed us with its feeling of landing in a tropical resort in the middle of a cornfield! The whole apartment and outdoor spaces were just what our family needed as we dealt with my father-in-law’s funeral this week. We were able to destress each night and just have time to reflect and process our feelings by being surrounded with the restful beauty of nature and the beautiful spaces Karan and her family have created and are so willing to share. The pool, sauna, and pool house were amazing and the apartment had everything we could possibly need. Karan is the perfect hostess with attention to detail and making sure we were comfortable while still giving us space. We will definitely be back, hopefully under happier circumstances when we can truly relax and unwind in this oasis!"

We rented both the barn & the studio. It did not disappoint! Karen & Steve accommodated us with our choice of music & a well heated pool. There was a fire pit for S’mores & the cutest swing set/tree house. The pool house was one of a kind luxury for the adults. Although we were nervous about staying on property with the owner, it was very private & we felt right at home. On a rainy day, we headed to town for bowling & checked out a local restaurant recommended by Karan- it was amazing too. I rate this experience a 6/5 & my kids keep asking if we can go back soon."

From the start, Karen was attentive to my questions about the place, and it was easy to settle into the place. I was going to her place to study for the bar, with my Mom, and the place was perfect for that. There were theater chairs with tables that can be added to them, that allowed me to lay down and relax, or to study in quiet or with a Netflix movie going. The carpet was a cozy soft carpet, and the bets were very easy to fall asleep in. The bathroom and shower were clean and had everything you needed to wash off with. Karen was exceptionally kind and gave us great ideas on what to do in the city and how to get to certain places. The place was perfect and the stay was perfect."

Stayed with kids","Rest, Cleanliness, Warmth, Faith, Rejuvenation,...This is what you can expect when you stay at S&K Getaway. I was apprehensive at first staying in another person’s home, especially with 4 kids, 4-12 years in age, but I’m glad I trusted my wife. We enjoyed every minute of our short getaway where we just wanted family time before school starts. The pictures do not do it justice and neither will this review. The pool was perfect with plenty of outdoor space and different settings to relax. The perfect location for us to unplug and to enjoy each other as a family. You can enjoy a walk down a country road where life is slower and no cars. The sunset over the fields are what pictures are made of. If you do need anything, town is less than 10 minutes away. Highly recommend, you won’t be disappointed, they set the bar high for our first AirBnB.
Thank you Steve and Karan for a relaxing few days, we truly enjoyed our conversations. May God continue to bless you and your family!"

Karan was very welcoming, and the place was just lovely. It’s definitely in the middle of farm country, so don’t expect a grocery the next block over. But no need! Karan has everything we needed for a quick overnight. Coffee, juices, water, and cereal we’re ready to go. And the pool... just gorgeous. And peaceful! The entire place was immaculate, too. Thanks so much for a great stay."

As a host myself I take notice of everything, and I can’t think of a thing I would change. They have put a lot of thought and care into making your stay as comfortable as possible from fresh treats and breakfast foods I didn’t know existed! Take it from a traveler who has been at it a long time, this is a place you will want to come back to, and you won’t be sorry you booked a few nights or a few weeks!!

Heated pool, pool house, outside speakers for music, sauna extra & bathroom all new and well taken care of along with anything you need or wanted. Karen went over and beyond to make sure we were happy and taken care of during our stay. Playground area and treehouse, basketball hoop and ping pong table and a great dog too. Wonderful hosts as sweet and helpful as could be really make you feel welcomed. I highly recommend Steve & Karen’s place. Put it in your favorites and make it to Wilmington for a fantastic getaway."

Her house is a little slice of Heaven! A couple of things that our family found as an “extra” are independent heating/cooling controls, an awesome (according to our kids) play house and swing set, “mood lighting”, plush towels, and memory foam mattresses and pillows just to name a few. Anytime I had a question, she quickly responded. Although we didn’t utilize the pool and sauna, she took us around so we could see everything there is to offer! She’s thought of everything, down to a coffee bar and waters in the pool house next to the pool.
I could go on and on about Karan and her home. Pictures don’t do it justice! We will definitely be back!"

I would never have known Shawn was an Airbnb rookie had she not told me. From the gift basket of local coffee and baked goods to her helpful suggestions and recommendations she nailed it at every turn. I was just looking for a quiet getaway not too far from home and ended up having what may well have been my best Airbnb experience up to this point"

Everything was to expectations other than that. The owner stopped by to say hello and to introduction herself. She was very friendly and knowledgable about the area, and passionate about the land. Overall we had a great time! Much to see and do on the property so plan accordingly.

We enjoyed walking on the trails to the pond and being out in the quietness of nature. The property manager came to our door to see if we needed anything and gave us several recommendations for good pizza places, which we were looking for that night. Very thoughtful and sincere recommendations. We enjoyed eating at a local restaurant and playing at a nearby park (also her recommendation) afterwards. Overall, very nice stay and I would go there again for a get-away retreat! Surprisingly close to little towns and beautiful farms all around!"

We arrived quite late, it was snowing hard and we had trouble with the door code. We called Carol who answered quickly and reminded us of the correct code (we hadn't read to the end of the check-in instructions), and we got right in. The house was warm and cozy, and very comfortable.

The Cornhole game was a lot of fun! My family enjoyed the back deck and the shower also( waterfall type)! The host was very thoughtful in adding things to do, some great favorite movies on dvd, board games etc.
The owner/host was very friendly and helpful and answered questions promptly!
The only few downsides were that there were so many flies, many dead and living flies inside the home, in windows seals, on the curtains and on the floors. There were plug in nightlites (large ones) that I assume we're there to attract the flies. I had a hard time sleeping because I could hear the flies buzzing around in the room. There were flies on the floors that would spin around, on the countertops as well. This was the only problem that we had and it was becoming stressful to deal with. We did spend a lot of time using the flyswatter to kill flies."

Only downside was there were many dead and alive flies everywhere!!! It did become quite overwhelming at times.
Overall a beautiful place and very cozy!!"

Stayed with kids","We were 3 families (all cousins): 3 adults & 5 children (3-12).
1 adult had mobility challenges so downstairs bedroom & bathroom was perfect!
Children LOVED the “secret” knee wall storage upstairs & had more fun making forts than anything else!
Children all enjoyed their “sleep over” in the upstairs room with the 2 x double beds.
The main upstairs large bed was perfect for the “sentry guard”’parent!
Small room off to the side (no privacy door) with the single bed was perfect for an adult or older child.
PLENTY of space!
Kitchen was FULLY stocked with everything we needed to cook, refrigerate and clean!
Open plan space with table and barstools was perfect for family meals.
Sliding door onto porch with stunning view of fields was perfect for sitting and enjoying the stillness and peace - even in November (the adults drank their coffee and ate breakfast outside one morning together!)
Bathroom comes with washer and dryer. Helps you travel light.
TV & WiFi great."

Group trip","Nice area. Peaceful surroundings. Our complaint is the cleanliness and disrepair of the house. It was very dusty. We could feel dust in the bedding. There were dead and alive flies everywhere. We purchased a shop sweeper to clean up the flies because they were all over including on the beds. The fridge was very dirty and we had to clean it. The freezer unusable until my husband fixed it as well. The house was much cleaner when we left. Very pretty surrounds, but the house really needs a deep clean. We pay a cleaning fee and should not have to spend hours cleaning when we arrive."

Stayed a few nights","The area is very quiet and peaceful. Outside there is a large deck with lovely view of surrounding fields. Chuck & Carol have provided everything you need in the kitchen and then some. The frig even had some basics like eggs, butter, coffee creamers by example. A Keurig coffee maker was provided along with many options to use in it (coffees, teas, hot chocolate). We also saw a s’mores kit and lots of spices. In the roomy bathroom we found lots of nice sized towels (but the thin small ones you sometimes find in these places) shampoo, conditioner, toothpaste, and tooth brushes. As there were only two of us, we only used the first floor so can’t speak to the upstairs bedroom(s). Our gps didn’t recognize the correct location, but it was close… a little further down the road and as there is a picture in the listing, it was easy to recognize."

Kitchen is very well stocked, as is bathroom and laundry room- you could travel for a good chunk of time without needing to pack up your whole house. Kid friendly accommodations too- toys and games.

The fridge was stocked up but could have used a little cleaning. Kitchen is fully stocked and the cookies were a nice touch for the little ones. Toys were available for my little ones. Scenery is immaculate. So beautiful. Wi-Fi is not that great. It kept going in and out and I could not get work done. The farmhouse was close to every place I needed to go to visit family. Drawers were packed with sheets and pillow cases so I could not use the drawers in the bedroom. Maybe clear out a few drawers for the next guests to make it easier to put their clothes away. Other than a few minor things this place was relaxing and peaceful.

There was plenty of space for our family of 4, and our kids were so happy to find a bunch of toys, games and DVDs ready to play with once we arrived. This was the most well-stocked Airbnb I've ever stayed at -- tons of extra towels, lots of things already in the kitchen to help with cooking, and they even had some coffee, cereal and chips available for guests. We found the property to be so peaceful. I loved opening the doors in the dining area and seeing the birds and miles of green space. We even saw two adorable bunnies a couple times that were chasing each other around. The beds and linens were so comfortable. The only downside was there is only one bathroom, and it's on the first floor, but we made do. :) Thanks for the wonderful stay, and for your friendly welcome, Kim! We wouldn't hesitate to book it again if we were to return to the area."

Lots of birds and nature. There is a pond and flowing water with geese which can be messy on the ground so wear appropriate shoes if you walk up to see them. We loved sitting on the back porch watching the birds and eating. Plenty of beds for us. Good for a family.

Group trip","The home was in a beautiful location and it easily slept 4 couples. The upstairs could be a little awkward if you are not comfortable with whoever your staying with because the upstairs bedrooms have a little less privacy, but when you need beds for a larger group then this is your place.
Something that could be easy to take for granted is hot water, and with the amount of people we had here, we never ran out of hot water in the shower.
Two things I wish they had here would have been a vacuum cleaner and an actual coffee maker rather than a Keurig, and those would be our groups only complaints.
We enjoyed our stay here very much and it was easy to gather together in the living room areas or on the porch for playing card games and chatting together."

Stayed with kids","Magical, quiet country farm. We stayed with two kids and 3 grown-ups and it felt like we had plenty of room. There are 4 sleeping areas. The house is located in South Charleston Ohio, a small agricultural community. Yellow Springs Ohio and Glen Helen nature preserve is a 20 minute drive away on pleasant country roads.
The house is clean. The kitchen is large and had cereal, chips and some drinks available. The kitchen and dining room has large windows which show the view of the sunrise on the farm fields. Walking trail off the house which passes a babbling brook.
When we were there the property manager lived in a camper in the barn so was available to answer questions. On our last day she took 20-30 minutes to show the kids the chickens, dogs and cows. The kids harvested eggs."

This house was very cute and even decorated for Christmas! There were farm fresh eggs in the fridge for them to enjoy and many snacks. Much appreciated the great hospitality! Will definitely be using them again for when family comes to town.

Stayed with kids","Beautiful home in farm country! My family was visiting Clifton Mills for Christmas and wanted to spend the night with a large group. The ""Homestead"" was so lovely and welcoming. Our hosts thought of everything to make the stay comfortable and provided every amenity possible. They even had delicious cookies from a local bakery set out for us. (Had a little trouble with the wi-fi, but the hosts addressed this proactively.) It's in a rural area but the house was actually quite easy to find. If you are looking for a peaceful getaway, you will not be disappointed in this place."

Stayed with kids","Just terrific--perfect for our family Christmas get-together of 3 sisters and our families! It was quiet, private, surrounded by rolling fields and filled with early-winter light. The rooms in the house are spacious; we really appreciated the large, fully appointed kitchen and dining area. There was a large screen TV for the football fans among us, and plenty of bedroom space for the littles who are still nappers (including cribs.) Kim greeted us like old friends. The only thing I thought I was going to miss by not having our celebration at home was the Christmas cheer--imagine my surprise when we walked in to see a fully decorated tree, spice-scented air, and cute Christmas decor and pillows. The hosts really go the extra mile for guests! Can't wait to come back when the weather is not so cold!"

Stayed with kids","Chuck and Carol's place was great. Peaceful and serene; so much to explore. It was a bit buggy so we didn't do that much exploring by the pond as we wanted to, but beautiful nonetheless. The house was clean, the blankets and pillows were super comfortable.
The one thing that threw me off was the four bedrooms listed. Upstairs, there is a separate bedroom with 2 full beds; and then there is a queen bed and a daybed (maybe single bed) in what I would call a nook. This nook is the best spot in the house, with the best views out of the super big windows. This wasn't bad, it just wasn't what I was expecting.
There were so many extras available. If you forgot anything, they had it. Snacks and coffee were stocked in the kitchen for us, as well as extra stuff in the bathroom.
This was a lovely place."

It was a nice place to relax on our adventure. There were a few small issues with the cleanliness (dust, dead flies, etc). The walk along the trail to the pond was beautiful... just be aware that it's near tall grass, and we found several ticks on our clothes and on ourselves during and after the walk (to be expected in that environment, just something to be aware of). But the hosts and property manager were very friendly, and we were happy to include this stop on our journey."

We got invited over to the barn to let my 3 boys play in the loft & pet their sweet pups! We had an issue with the tv & DVD player & it was promptly fixed & we even got a new DVD player hooked up! Only a few minor things that we suggest to increase the pleasure of the stay. Having a tv in the master bedroom even just a small one would have been great. Possibly a small sectional, bigger couch or even adding 2 recliners downstairs would be great. Possibly an upgraded more firm mattress in the master would be great too! The outside light never goes off & is extremely bright. It took away from the beautiful night sky & enjoyment at the fire. These things are all minor & we still had an amazing time! If you’re looking for for a serene getaway with tons of great outdoor space this is your place!"

The baseboards were dusty, and the pillows in the front room had big yellow stains on them. The floor was soft in some places, which was a little scary, and the sheets were definitely cheap and scratchy. Finding the place was a little hard because it’s behind a door labeled A and B and up a sketchy flight of stairs. Parking was great once we found it, but again not super well-described. Would we stay here again? Probably, because again it was good for Washington Courthouse, ohio."

Stayed one night","Laura is running a first-class Air BnB. She has a charming older home that is absolutely immaculate! Located in a beautiful pastoral setting in south central Ohio. The amenities (both in-room and public area) are all you will ever need. Stocked fridge, fruit on the dining room table, chocolates on the bed, etc. That kind of attention to detail. She is one of the most attentive hosts I have come across in my BnB experience. The morning I left I was served one of the best breakfasts I've ever had while on the road. If you're traveling I-70 through Ohio, it's worth the 45 minute drop south (at Columbus) to stay here. And you'll enjoy that drive! Highly recommended!"

Home had lovely characteristics of an older country house that has been well maintained, modern touches, and is absolutely spotless. Loved eating homemade granola, drinking coffee, and playing a few of the games Laura had to offer. Nice to have all the space to park right in back of the house. Location and home was quite and peaceful. Will not find anything nicer in the area! We came to town to see the play Tecumseh, which was amazing and 12 minutes away. We will be back next year."

I just became gluten free due to medical issues and I often feel bad asking for food that is gluten free, especially while someone is cooking it. But Laura asked if we had any dietary concerns and I told her, and she not only offered but insisted on making me my own gluten free breakfast. We cannot speak highly enough about her!"

Stayed a few nights","Laura's airbnb was the perfect home to stay in while visiting family. The description of the room and private bathroom was accurate, and very comfortable for 2 people. We had breakfast every morning which was super convenient for us, as we were working remotely and needed to join meetings right after breakfast. We did not get to try the weekend breakfast, but I heard it's delicious!
There was a small foldable desk in the room, as well as plenty of workspaces throughout the house, such as living room, dining room, etc. The house is a very short walk away from Main St, where we picked up lunch or dinner from Steve's Village Inn or Kings Inn.
Laura was a wonderful host as she checked in on us throughout our stay. We couldn't have asked for a better experience! Cannot wait to be back, this will be our first choice every time we visit family."

A genuine woman who I barely even know but I admire so much just from staying at her place for 2 days!

Stayed a few nights","Great little home to spend a couple nights for relaxing and regenerating. Very quiet neighborhood, not too close to neighbors. Gas station, grocery store, and pizza place within a half mile and easy to get to. Very nice, firm bed for good night's sleep. Kitchen well equipped. TV/movie service and Xbox available as offered. Wanted to ride a bike, but it was too cold during my stay. The firepit was well placed and perfect for some fire relaxation."

After a long day at the barn the following day, it was wonderful to be able to come back and cook a filling meal in a warm and cozy place. We are so thankful we found this place and if we ever come back for another show at Champion Center, we will definitely stay here again."

Beautiful view of the backyard at sunrise. We didn’t get the chance to utilize the outdoor fire pit/grill but maybe next time. Washer and dryer on site. Wonderful rainfall shower head and they do have some toiletries on hand if you forgot something. I happened to forget my makeup remover but no worries, there were a couple makeup wipes in the bathroom drawer, so appreciated! This is a small home that makes you feel right at home and easy to relax in. Very comfortable bed and pillows as well. We only stayed one evening but wish we had stayed longer! Will definitely stay again, thank you Rachel for your hospitality. :-)"

I thought our reservation was for one day longer and she so graciously gave us some extra time to check out. She was kind and professional and even called us to let us know that in our hurry to check out (again, this was MY MISTAKE) we'd left some items in the dryer. She was kind and went out of her way to ensure we enjoyed our time and WE DID! Such a wonderful getaway and time with our Cedarville student."

We were able to do a quick load of laundry, get dinner from one of the local restaurants that the host left menus for, and then the tvs already came with Netflix and everything so it was all ready to go, no need to fuss around and set anything up. The bathroom was very clean with a lovely rain shower and adorable little single serving toiletries for us to use. Overall it was a very refreshing way to end our long day of driving."

There was Starbucks coffee for the Kureg, toothbrush kits, sewing kits, there was even some crushed red pepper for the pizza I ordered. The list goes on too. There are bikes in the shed to use on the nice bike trail that runs behind the house and a fire pit and chairs outside. The neighborhood reminded me of the small town I grew up in including the train whistling as it comes through town. I felt safe and it was a quiet, calm setting. This place will exceed your expectations! Not to mention the world-class pizza just a few blocks away at the Purple Monkey. If I'm ever in the area again I'll definitely stay here. A big thank-you to Rachel!"

Stayed a few nights","Absolutely perfect!!
We stay in a lot of AirBNB and I have to say this was probably one of the best little get-a-ways we have had. The house is small but makes perfect use of the space. It had everything we could have needed or wanted. Super clean, comfortable bed and couch, a great porch to sit and enjoy coffee, a firepit that they provided wood for, a grill, a Keurig with some K-cups just in case you forgot them.
They thought of everything and although we brought what we needed it was very thoughtful that they had so many little extras just in case... pop-tarts if you needed a quick breakfast, popcorn for a night cuddled with your honey, cotton balls and q-tips in the bathroom, every kitchen item you would need along with cooking oil just in case...my goodness everywhere you turned if you had forgotten something somehow they had a small amount to get you thru. I was impressed.
There are bikes in the garage and a biking path that runs right past the back of the property.
The place in located on a quiet street in a small town but that is just what we wanted. We were close to hiking, antique mall, wineries, Wright-Pat AFB..it was a good spot to homebase from and so our mornings and evenings where relaxing at the home and then out enjoying the area.
And Rachel can point you in the right direction for things to do, we appreciated the tips of places to go. Clifton Mill was a great hike and lunch, the wineries we found where fun, The Speakeasy Raman Bar was really cool with great food.
So if you want a get away that will give you an opportunity to rest, reconnect with a loved one or just visit some interesting places this is a great place to stay. We will definitely be back."

It was very convenient to where the funerals were held, so that figured in to our decision but if you read our earlier review from just two weeks ago, that tells more about what other factors also figured in our decision to book here again. This is an area for people who are NOT
looking for nightlife. It is for those who love peace and quiet, nature, the beauty of rolling countryside and friendly people."

Stayed one night","Cosy, comfortable, clean--that is what Mark's accommodation was. It is sort of off-the-beaten-path but that is precisely what made it so wonderful. The peacefulness was welcomed. We loved that it was so quiet and dark at night (we live in the city and get quite a bit of ambient light and noise). It was very clean. The beds were wonderful as was the bedding. Another plus is how many electrical outlets they had. Most places seem to not have enough or in the right places. The two bedrooms were lovely with wonderful closet space. The heating worked well (it was chilly out). This is a place to chill out, not to party or dine out in fancy restaurants. But if you are wanting to slow down, enjoy nature (it is in a wooded area) and just relax, then this place in this area will please you. Mark was also a responsive host and accommodating."

It is perfectly clean.
There were four adults and 1 toddler in our group and we were so comfortable. Thankful to find a pack and play in the closet!
The homemade quick bread was a sweet touch.

Super clean and super beautiful and peaceful. I would’ve given anything to have had time to explore the grounds more because it looked beautiful as well. Would definitely stay here again, and recommend to anyone looking to get away for a peaceful retreat or ideal for a place to stay while using the Pine Lodge or Cedar Lodge there in town for events. Which is what we were there in town for. We had a wedding and used this for the bridal party and then for the bride and groom. It was absolutely perfect. Thank you for everything Mark! ☺️"

The house was easy to find in the dark and it was in a safe location tucked away in the countryside where we felt comfortable parking our truck that had a bed full of our fishing equipment in it. Check-in was easy and we were greeted with the sound of peaceful music playing when we stepped inside. After a long day of driving the comfort of the bed we slept on here was so rewarding. We woke up in the morning to the pleasant sound of rain outside and had such a relaxing morning drinking coffee and enjoying the homemade cupcakes that were waiting for us when he had arrived the night before. We really appreciated all of the personal touches here and just how beautiful of a location it was in. Both of us have stayed in quite a bit of Airbnb's and we both agreed that thus far this one has definitely been our favorite. We really hope to stay here again in the future when we are traveling. If you are looking for a super cozy, peaceful and welcoming Airbnb to stay at, this is it!"

Stayed a few nights","Beautiful rural property surrounded but nature and farmland. It was comfortable and the owners are quick to help with any issues. Even though the guest space is shared with a small office in the back downstairs it still feels very much private and had no impact on comfort. And just as a conformation on the doggy they have on property, her space is her space she is only accustomed to her owners interacting with her so if you bring kids I’d advise not going to the area to the left of the guest house by a small wooden shed she is tied up there and needs her space, this isn’t a negative nor would it stop me staying again, I was with all adults and no kids."

It was a lifesaver too-I am from out of town and we were planning to get ready in the hotel down the road, but I was so worried we wouldn’t have enough room. Last minute minute I found this place and booked it immediately. I spent the night there with three of my bridesmaids the day before, and then the next morning we got ready! It was able to hold tons of food, 6 bridesmaids, 1 bride, 2 mothers, 2 hairstylists (and a hairstylist’s mother-in-law lol), and 1 makeup artist- comfortably. The place was even more beautiful than the pictures conveyed. So homey and welcoming and my girls and I absolutely loved it. There were kind and helpful notes left out around the place and the instructions were clear and organized! Also loved the Bible out, it was perfect to wake up and read the Bible at the little desk next to the studio bed before the day began. 100/10 would recommend!!! My husband and I would like to go there in the future to enjoy the board games and books and just the spacious place. Thank you to the wonderful hosts!!"

First, you walk into the Airbnb to soft classical music playing and the scent of lavender. The space was meticulously decorated, clean, and looked better than the description.
But baby, it is the details that made me never want to leave. It was the fresh cinnamon bread and chocolate chip cookies that were waiting for me. It was the fully stocked coffee and tea station, complete with three kinds of creamer. It was the complimentary water and fresh orange juice. It was the heavenly pillowtop mattress that knocked me out in five minutes.
Oh and I didn't mention the cherry on the top. It was pet-friendly! (I know!) The pets were not allowed into the Airbnb and had to stay in the garage, but ya'll, the garage was the size of half a basketball court, was clean and cool for my dogs. It was so big that my dog and I played fetch! And with no pet fee, I was won over.
I wish I could have stayed longer. Highly recommend."

Stayed one night","We had a very relaxing stay. The added touches of music playing softly, a lit candle, homemade bread, fresh flowers, and homemade cookies made the space especially inviting. Mark greeted us at the door, and explained the basics. Highly recommended out of the way, quiet, super clean place to stay. Perfect gateway to the Hocking Hills."

The accommodations worked well for 4 of us and were very nice and precisely what we hoped for. Having a disc golf course on the property was a plus for one of our friends who always comes prepared. We would not hesitate to stay again. Thanks Mark & Susan!

There was calming classical music playing when we arrived; cinnamon bread, and cookies were available for snacks and there was barely enough to go around they were so good!

Stayed with kids","Mark and Susan were sooooo welcoming and kind. We booked on EXTREMELY short notice, deciding to take a stop in between Chicago and Blacksburg, Virginia. Our hosts got the room ready in a flash and gave us a tour. The property is amazing and we enjoyed the fire pit - hearing Wood Thrushes, Red-eyed Vireos, and Red-Bellied Woodpeckers amongst other birds. We also saw rabbits and deer roaming the nearby fields.
The rooms were immaculately clean and stylish. The best part (beyond our host’s kindness) was freshly baked bread and cookies.
Highly, highly recommend."

Stayed a few nights","The Guest House was in the country, for us this was a bonus. It was only a short drive (about 10 minutes) from city limits of Washington C.H. and about half hour from Circleville or Chillicothe, not much farther to Grove City or Columbus. We drove over an hour to Tar Hollow, that was our longest commute. Anywho, I wish we had more time to sit and enjoy the beautiful foliage on the grounds or go for a brisk stroll because the area really showcases the beauty of rural Ohio, America's heartland (my home state 😉). We were traveling with an infant, and staying in a typical hotel room would have been a nightmare of difficulty and inconvenience. Our baby girl needed room to crawl, play and room with us in a separate room from her big brother so she wasn't waking him up in the middle of the night. The Guest House was like an apartment over a big garage. It was spacious and beautifully setup. Whomever did the decorating, has great taste in my opinion. When we came in there were decorative lights on and soft music playing. It was so warm and welcoming. There was a genuine good energy in that place, something we all needed. There was also home baked pumpkin bread which was THE best I have ever had in my life!! The beds were amazing and soft like a down mattress. There are 2 bedrooms and 1 spare twin bed in a nook in the living room area. All kid tested and approved. I believe we see reminders of God's love and encouragement, in many little things, if we are on the watch for it. The Guest House was full of such little reminders, I'd find one and find comfort. I wouldn't change anything, this was better than any hotel and I would rather invest in good, hard working American folks than a hotel chain. In fact we hope to return on our next trip back home. Thank you Mark and Susan very much for making my baby girls' first trip home (and our stay as well), so comfortable. God bless you both!"

Well arranged and set up for our family of four that stayed there several days while visiting family in the area. Mark and Susan made sure we could reach them easily and had some small, yummy treats available which were very welcome after a long travel day. A bit remote but the serenity was welcomed by us. Very clean, comfortable beds, nice supply of towels and so on. Quite the find and a great value. We’d stay there again for sure when/if the opportunity arises in the future!"

Stayed one night","Mark and Susan's place was the last night of a 12 night trip for us. It was our third Airbnb on this trip and by far the best. It put the second b in Airbnb. A spacious place with amazing, unexpected treats. It gave our children the opportunity to have their own space on the last night, which was much needed. It was sparkling clean, welcoming, relaxing, and with fluffy towels (no other place had fluffy towels!). If we had more energy, we would have definitely have loved to have walked the grounds as it seemed to be a lovely area. It gave us a chance to recharge before a long drive home the next day. We will definitely consider it when/if we drive back to Iowa as it is approximately the halfway point for us."

Stayed with kids","We cannot give enough praise, for Mark & Susan's 2 bedroom apartment. We felt at home here. They provided baked goods, drinks (milk, juice, coffee, tea), and such a cozy, relaxing environment. The beds were extremely comfortable. We didn't want to get out of them in the morning. The entire place is decorated, as if it came out of a magazine. We didn't have any kids stay with us on this trip (we originally planned on my nephew staying, but he wanted to stay out our Grandpa's house near by), this place is definitely family friendly. It is spacious, the furniture is comfy, and they have a ton of movies, books, and board games to keep you entertained during your down time. My husband and I enjoyed a game of life, while eating the delicious cinnamon bread, one evening. Their property is extremely beautiful, and has a such a warm feel to it. We were welcomed by Mrs. Susan, as soon we pulled up. Check in and out was a breeze, and they were very helpful with any questions we had. We will definitely stay here again in the future. We highly recommend Mark & Susan's place!!!!"

You can tell this Guest House has been decorated with nothing but love with details down to the having real flowers in the vases. Though we didn't have much time to use the grounds, they were nothing but beautiful and well maintained, and we loved their pup. Being able to park in the garage was wonderful as well.

Stayed one night","Mark & Susan’s guest house is so beautiful. We could see ourselves renting it as our apartment, it was so perfect for us. They had soft music playing and cozy lighting on when we arrived. The beverage selection was great and everything was set out perfectly. One of the beds was too soft for me, but luckily there were 2 more beds to choose from so I found a comfortable spot. We watched a movie on the projector and really enjoyed our night in."

Stayed a few nights","Mark and Susan’s apartment was a wonderful place, and we would highly recommend this rental if you are in the area. So much thought went into making this space charming, homey, and very comfortable. We really enjoyed the fresh milk, orange juice, homemade granola, and breads (cinnamon swirl, and lemon zucchini). Since we forgot to bring coffee with us, it was appreciated that was provided as well. If you are looking for somewhere to relax after your day of adventuring then you have picked the right place. The fire pit, and picnic area was a nice bonus. It gave us a chance to enjoy the nature around us. We loved hearing the sounds of crickets, a whip-poor-will (bird), and seeing lightning bugs. So peaceful. If our travels bring us back to this area, and this place is available we would definitely stay here again."

You were both such a pleasure to deal with. You really made our family feel like we were at home: from the wonderful cinnamon bread, cookies, fresh orange juice, milk and granola.

Stayed one night","Gorgeous place, clean, feels like a home away but beware or signing a document and rules to follow. I was even nervous being charged if I left the AC on and was asking for verification from the host before I left. We even left the house spotlessly clean and washed everything although we already paid for a cleaning fee to clean the place ourselves? All because on their document he makes you sign he expects you to leave the place as you found it. It was a bit off."

Stayed a few nights","Mark and Susan are religious people, and their guest house is a glowing testament to their faith. I've stayed in a lot of Airbnb places over the last couple of years, but theirs is the first in my experience to have a guest book, which is one indication among many of their exceptional hospitality. They're also exceptionally thoughtful and accommodating, for example booking us for only two nights rather than the three we requested, because they knew our plans were indefinite. People who wrote in the guest book before me echoed my sentiments: the place is perfect and inspiring. Nobody has ever given them less than five stars and I doubt that anyone ever will. There didn't use to be any Airbnb's in Fayette County, but visitors to the area are now fortunate to have Mark and Susan's at their disposal."

It was hot out during the day and we enjoyed a few hours getting refreshed in the cool running water at the creek that was only a fewsteps away. The bed was comfy with plenty of blankets and pillows. Town is only 15 minutes away if you need anything during your stay. We thoroughly enjoyed relaxing the weekend away.

We enjoyed using the wood stove to keep us warm on a rainy spring day. The hot tub was perfect under the stars. And the surroundings were so peaceful and beautiful. There’s a picnic table, firepit, and swing set outdoors and plenty of room to run. Absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a rustic and cozy getaway."

Stayed a few nights","Great cabin, especially if you are interested in the history and construction methods. Everything was very clean and well put together. We stayed at the cabin when it got down to the single digits in temperature and we were not cold at all. Keeping the wood stove going made the cabin cozy through the day and night. There was more in the kitchen than I thought there would be including a electric cooktop, pots and pans, and an electric skillet. That made cooking easy. Water taste really good. We went hiking over at the Highlands Nature Sanctuary and it was beautiful. My only complaint is that the cabin is close to a road and close to two other out buildings. All in all it was a great weekend getaway."

If you are in Wilmington for the bar exam: it is worth it to stay here rather than a hotel. Only 15 minutes from the testing center (taking peaceful back roads each morning helped my nerves a bit). Plus, a full kitchen and you get to stay away from the nervous bad energy you’d have with hundreds of others who are at the hotel."

Each unit was cleaned extremely well, had ample space, and was fully stocked with everything we needed. Our parents slept so well on the comfy bed they didn’t wake up until late morning!

From our arrival to our departure, everything was absolutely perfect. I’d say we had high expectations and everything exceeded them! The beds were very comfortable, there was coffee provided, the pool was dreamy and incredibly warm on a cool fall night, the entire place was kept spotlessly, and best of all we felt we had made a new friend before leaving. Wonderful, absolutely wonderful Karan!"

The pool is so relaxing, warm, and inviting. There are plenty of chairs & tables to choose from. When a storm rolled in, I curled up with a book in the pool house- the couch is so comfy!Karen has a speaker at the pool that she’ll cast music to for your enjoyment & the house has a roku TV which I casted music to when I was hanging out at the house.
Cannot say enough about this place! Will definitely be back.

They ONLY potential downside was the location. There’s not a ton going on in the immediate area especially at night. We knew this going in and were looking for nice family weekend trip, and that’s exactly what we had! We will be back for our next family weekend. Cowan lake is very nice and there are some trails at the lake to walk which we enjoyed. If you’re looking for a party town look elsewhere in my opinion."

The two bedrooms were perfect for us and our kids. It’s cozy and has a lovely fireplace. We put together a puzzle that was there, played games we brought, although they have a few available too. We did a mix of eating out and cooking. There is salt and pepper, but you’ll need to bring everything else.
The Barn is super clean and because it was Christmas week, had lots of decorations and the cutest little Christmas tree! We would definitely come back! Karen was great at communicating and check in and out are super easy."

Beds were so comfortable (wife took multiple naps). Shower was great. We loved having the washer/dryer available to us so we could go home with all clean clothes. Kitchen had everything you needed - it was nice to have two grills to pick from - a nice charcoal Weber grill (bring your own charcoal) and an amazing Lynx gas grill by pool area.
Speaking of pool area - that was the most amazing part of the trip. Initially, we were skeptical of hanging out at pool right next to owner’s house - we were wrong. We felt right at home and Karan was so accommodating. Remember - if you need something, message Karan...she responds in minutes and delivers.
Kids didn’t want to leave and we will definitely be back."

Although the barn is on Karan’s property, the barn is a little home unto itself, with the perk of a swimming pool and friendly owners nearby. The barn is decorated so nicely - top notch furnishings and appliances, but at the same time it is welcoming and cozy. It is in the middle of Ohio farm country so the views are lovely, yet Wilmington is close by for a quick trip to Wal-Mart for dinner goodies and a set of pajamas for my friend who forgot to bring hers along! :)"

Stayed one night","Can’t even fully express how amazing! The space is top notch and sparkling clean. The shower is a special treat, the beds are so comfy and all around very peaceful and secluded in the middle of the country. Don’t even get me started on the pool and sauna. Hands down the nicest pool and environment I’ve had through Airbnb (or ever), which is a lot. Karan is also very kind and hospitable... communication was easy and responded quick! Will definitely return!"

Stayed a few nights",A perfect place to getaway for a peaceful weekend. So quiet and serene! The decor of the barn is so rustic and modern at the same time. The pool was beautiful as well as the sunsets. An amazing weekend oasis!

Stayed with kids","My family wanted to get away on a vacation before school, but with Covid-19 we wanted something low key. The place was beautiful and we had a ton of fun swimming, cooking out, shopping, and spending time together as a family. Karan was very welcoming and quick to respond if we had questions. Highly recommend."

Stayed with kids","Amazing spaces (we rented both the barn & the studio)!! Beautiful property surrounded by gorgeous fields, yet only a few minutes to town. We loved the pool & amazing pool house. The barn was super clean (still smells new) & offered a great space for our family & friends dinners. The kids had a blast with ping pong, playing with Nibbles (sweet dog), swimming, making S’mores by the fire, & playing in the awesome tree house/swing set. Although Karan & Steve live on the property, we felt that it was truly private. They were amazing hosts & helped us find a great restaurant in town as well. I highly recommend both of the spaces!!"

Stayed a few nights","We loved your place and really enjoyed your great hospitality. Can't wait to return some day. The pool, the BBQ grill, & the sauna were my favorite parts. My wife loved the decor and the super comfortable king sized bed!

Stayed a few nights","Having never stayed at an AirBnB we were not sure what to expect but this experience was far better than anything we imagined! The barn was beautiful, so cozy and very nicely kept with thoughtful touches that made us feel very welcome. The property overall is such a gem, secluded and quiet, our girls loved the tree house, swing set and the tire swings! The pool area makes you feel like you are at a resort, it is so beautiful, but you still feel at home at the same time. Karan & Steve give you plenty of privacy but we found ourselves hoping to see them because they are a delight to talk to. Our whole family got so excited every time Nibbles & Wilson came running out, such sweet dogs! This was the perfect quiet and relaxing escape from the craziness of 2020!"

Stayed with kids",Karans place was absolutely amazing. The location was perfect for a weekend getaway! The barn was so cute and stylish! Karan was quick to respond for any of our needs. The pool and all the extras was amazing. The first night we had the pool to ourselves and the second night we shared with the girls renting the other rental but they were super friendly so it wasn't a big deal. They also had the cutest playhouse. We will definitely be back to visit!! ❤

Stayed with kids","My family and I spent a week here and had a great time. My children loved having access to a pool and absolutely loved that it ""glowed"" at night. We did spend a couple of day trips going to Columbus which was only about an hour away. We also did some nearby outlet shopping and could have gone to an amusement park but the kids had fun at the pool so we skipped the amusement park this trip. Karan and Steve were so nice to talk with. They were always available if we had questions but gave us space to enjoy the property. Their dog, Nibbles was great to have around as well. My oldest was very sad to leave Nibbles behind. We loved having him around. Thank you so much Karan and Steve."

Stayed a few nights","Great place to stay! Beautiful country side, and the pool is relaxing! Just remember you’ll share the pool with the other apartment if it’s rented, too. Wasn’t a big deal for us since the other couple was nice. We did a lot of cooking in the kitchen, had to get creative for a few things, but otherwise it had most things we needed. When there are Frontgate towels in the bathroom - you know it’s a nice place ;)"

Stayed a few nights","The barn was such a lovely place to stay - beautifully styled and sparkling clean. The pool was fantastic - there are even beach towels, tubes and floaties to use as well as a sauna. Everything was just amazing. We forgot our cork screw and Karan brought us one over to borrow! I can not recommend this stay more!"
