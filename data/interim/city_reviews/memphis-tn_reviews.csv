We were able to walk to restaurants/bars/entertainment while feeling safe and worry free. Such cute decor and you really feel at home during your stay. We would definitely stay here again!"

Significant ambient noise from airplanes, drumming neighbors, and trains.
The nearby neighborhood is nice but I didn’t feel completely safe. Erica provided restaurants recommendations which I appreciated. Erica was an excellent and responsive host. The knocks are about the surrounding area. Still worthy of 4 stars."

Stayed a few nights","This house is in a rough neighborhood. We had to travel to the east side to do any shopping, just to feel safe. The parking is a carport that's seen better days, there's also a broken down vehicle in it, so it's a tight space. The house is just alright. Really uncomfortable furniture and the bed is as hard as stone. It's wasn't the cleanest either. There was used sponges in the kitchen, and used loofas in the bathroom. The neighborhood is quiet though, but there's a bit of heavy traffic in the mornings. All in all, I got what I paid for."

Stayed with kids","This was our very 1st Airbnb experience. We always stay at hotels & resorts but figured since it was one night we could try something new! The host was great. She answered all our questions right away so she definitely gets a 5 star. After we booked she told us more of what to expect being that it was our first time. She said it was a very old home which it is, with airplanes passing nearby (we didn't notice that), with a drummer who is the adjacent neighbor & he does indeed drum at night but it is not cumbersome. The house was much smaller in person than the pictures seem so a very cozy home. It was as clean as you could get an old home & I am a neat freak. Everything really was spotless except like the books & accessories that were coated with dust but everyone misses that. For the price I would not make it my first choice next time, the fees take it to an overpriced stay & all the surrounding hotels were actually cheaper in the end. Checkin was flexible & smooth. Museum nearby"

Less than 15 minutes to everything you would want to see. Thanks so much for a wonderful stay!

Stayed a few nights","Stay was wonderful and the place was very well appointed. Layout and furnishings were thoughtful and the bed very comfortable. Erica was an excellent host, and I really enjoyed the Cooper-Young area of Memphis… hip, artsy, and not touristy. Ended up spending a lot of time walking to nearby places and not needing to go down to Beale street or anything to have a good time.
Only very minor retractions… seemed like a prior tenant was a shedder (hair, not cross but present), the bathroom hooks were a little hard to use, and the desk chair could have been a little more comfortable (I work remote and was working full hours though). Completely out of hosts control was that the outdoor cat presence in the ‘hood left some notable cat smell nearby. And there is a dog daycare type place that had a lot of barking, but only during day. All minor compared to the overall great place and host."

Stayed a few nights","My husband & I had such a lovely time staying at Erica’s property for the weekend. I will say that this is one of the louder Airbnb’s that I have stayed in around the Midtown area to no fault of the host. Duplexes are a hit or miss when it comes to noise, but Erica’s really makes up for it with its charm. The entire place was spotless, linens were in endless supply, the decor effortlessly cool, and all additional amenities incredibly easy to access and use. Though you can only park on one side of the street (if needed there is an additional space provided in the back), parking was a breeze even when coming in late at night. The best part about our stay was the neighborhood - everything you can imagine needing or wanting is within a 15-20 minute walking distance or 5-10 minute car ride! Erica provided us with all the details we needed before our arrival and even gave us recommendations for places to dine/things to do in the area. 10/10 would stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","On our tour in the south of the United States, we did two days in Memphis Station in Erica's duplex.
We particularly appreciated:
• The central location in a quiet and safe side street in a pleasant living environment, the aircraft noise only perceptible during the day did not bother us
• We were able to park the car safely right on the street in front of the house
• For exploring downtown we were able to use the nearby Park and Ride parking lot in Madison Ave and easily reach all the sights for little money by trolley
• Authentic house with very tasteful furnishings
• Exemplary amenities with all needful things
• Spacious kitchen, ideal for us as self-catering
• Comfortable air conditioning
• Extremely clean
• Very comfortable bed
• Absolute privacy: although the other half of the house was apparently inhabited, we did not hear anything
• Very helpful and always available hostess"

Everything was closed because it was a Monday, which was unusual. However, for an over night stay, it worked for me and my family. Thank you for allowing us in your home."

Stayed one night","We had a great experience staying at Maggie's place! She and Erica were kind enough to let us book last-minute and were very responsive through the process. We were able to park in the backyard carport, which gave an extra feeling of safety.
The space itself has a lot of old bungalow charm with high ceilings and crown molding; the interior furnishings and finishes were really well-chosen. We walked to a cute nearby restaurant and had a relaxing and romantic evening. The bed was comfortable and the Keurig coffee maker meant we could sleep in without having to find a coffee shop! Overall, I would say this is one of the best (if not THE best) airbnbs I've ever experienced!"

Words cannot express how grateful my wife and I are to you for having us & the little ones in your amazing home!"

We immediately felt welcome with the TV playing music and crickets playing on white noise machine in the bedroom. It also smelt nice.
We have been doing road trip and this was a lovely base to relax and of course visit Graceland. It was tasteful decorated - shabby chic as my husband described. Comfortable furniture and great facilities. We cooked every night in the well equipped kitchen. Minor gripe there was no kettle - we British like our cup of tea! We enjoyed relaxing in the lounge in the evening with Netflix on the TV. Everything was as described. I noted in previous reviews complaints re noise from planes and neighbours playing the drums. The neighbours were quiet and I did not hear planes at night so had a good nights sleep on the fab bed. In fact it was a quiet nice neighbourhood. I would highly recommend staying here."

The house was spotless. Everything I needed to prepare breakfast was available. The bed is super comfy & the faint sound of the train lulled me to sleep @ night.
The home is artfully & thoughtfully designed & decorated (this couple has great taste). So much better than staying in conventional accommodations. Hands down, one of the best places I've stayed at."

The house is in a very quiet neighbourhood within walking distance from some great restaurants in the Cooper-Young neighbourhood. The only downside was that it seems the next-door neighbour practices the drums around 7pm each day, lol — which was annoying, but was early enough that it didn’t disrupt our sleep. Definitely recommend this spot if you’re visiting Memphis!"

A Wonderful place, Very clean & the bed was super comfortable, also here’s a perk: this rental is literally around the corner from a Drive in Movie Theater. Valerie was very responsive, & she made sure my husband and I had everything we needed. We would definitely stay here again, Thanks for Hosting us."

Stayed over a week","Our stay at Skateland was simply delightful! From the moment we stepped inside, we felt a warm and welcoming ambiance that set the tone for a wonderful getaway.
The interior of the rental, though not an actual cabin, is cleverly designed to capture that cozy cabin feel. The decor is tasteful, with rustic elements that add character without compromising on modern comforts. The beds were comfortable, and the overall cleanliness of the rental was top-notch.
One of the highlights was the outdoor space—a small patio that provided a lovely spot to enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning or a glass of wine in the evening. The surroundings are quiet and peaceful, making it a great place to relax."

Otherwise the location felt pretty safe and convenient.

We got in later than expected and they made necessary accommodations to make sure we would have an easy time accessing the property. The place is clean and I felt at home. I am also thankful for the air conditioners, fans and humidifier because I have allergies and the cottage can get a little stuffy without these things. Otherwise, my only complaint would be the mattress. It’s either too soft and/or stiff because my back hurt immediately but this is subjective and based on preference. Everyone may not feel this way. Overall, everything was clean and it was an overall comfy and cute stay!"

Everyone raved about it and it was the perfect space for everyone to spread out but still be close. Chris proactively reached out the evening before and let us know the property was ready if we needed early check in. As a local, we love this neighborhood and as a neighbor, I really appreciate how well this property is managed- I had no idea it was an Airbnb for at least the first 6 months I lived here.

Very clean and tidy around the house, however the bed linens had some hairs left on the sheets :( but since it was late we just used the provided vacuum and slept just fine, the bed was veryyyy comfortable. The house was the perfect size for my boyfriend and I, keep in mind that the bathroom is very small and located off the living room. I loved the informational book, amazed that the cottage was once a garage! Even though we only spent 2 nights here, Chris was very responsive and offered us a guide with many things to do. Huey's is only about 10 minutes away if you want a great burger! We will definitely be back whenever we visit Memphis again!"

Stayed a few nights","Super cute older neighborhood that has been substantially gentrified since I grew up in Memphis 50 years ago. This back house is quiet and fun. It’s an older structure with some odd steps here and there so be advised to watch out in the night.
Very clean place. Excellent communication from the host. They have made the best of their structure. But there is no central unit and reaching at one of the window units required standing on a chair. Others have noted the bathroom is small. They are right. It was perfectly serviceable for us but to be honest if you are over six feet tall it will be a struggle.
I try to be honest about issues. But don’t let this seem a negative review. It’s so close to Cooper Young with its restaurants and bars. The host’s communication is immaculate. I would definitely stay here again."

The cottage was thoughtfully designed, whimsically decorated, and looked exactly like the listing photos. The location, in the Cooper-Young neighborhood of Memphis, is very safe and central to many unique shops, fantastic restaurants, and local sites. The kitchen was equipped with everything we needed to prepare meals, the bed & bath linens were of nice quality, and the living room sofa & recliner were comfy - like being at home.
Our host, Chris, was immediately responsive to all of our questions and he clearly communicated everything we needed to know before our arrival and made it super easy to check in - especially when our flight was delayed and we arrived after midnight. The Guidebook that Chris provides goes above & beyond. We highly recommend staying here!! Don't think twice - book it now!"

Stayed a few nights","Cadillac Cottage is a nice, private oasis located in the heart of Memphis with convenient ample parking. Go down the driveway between 1869 and 1873 Oliver Ave to get there. Nice decor and kitchen and comfortable furniture including the bed (be aware there is a step down into the BR). TV works great.
Place smelled stale when we arrived, and the toilet was clogged, which made me wonder how well it had been cleaned. I got the toilet unclogged with the plunger. The issue with the smallness of the bathroom is lack of leg room when you sit on the toilet, but I'm a 6'1"" 60-year old man and managed just fine. The instructional video for starting the gas heater was for another model, but the new heater was pretty self-explanatory. Video also mentioned an electric heater in the BR closet, which I couldn't find.
Chris was very attentive to all our concerns and brought us an electric heater as well as a nice air purifier.
All in all we enjoyed our stay and would stay there again!"

Stayed over a week","First, Chris and Debbie are excellent hosts; thank you both so much for being so gracious and accommodating. The space is modest yet was perfect for my solo (and extended) stay in Memphis; it is most ideal for 1 person or a couple. The space was very clean and has a charming outdoor porch that is perfect for morning coffee. The kitchen is great. The bathroom is small but was not an issue and the bedroom is nicely sized with a very comfortable bed. The location in the Cooper Young neighborhood was ideal; there are multiple (and excellent) dining options within walking distance of the cottage. Chris and Debbie were very thoughtful and readily available (they live next door) for anything that I may have needed. I'd absolutely consider the Cadillac Cottage (amongst their other Airbnb options nearby) when I return to Memphis. One would be hard pressed to find better hosts or values in this neighborhood. Thank you again."

Note: don’t be turned off be the air conditioning situation - the units in the space did a great job keeping this girl (who is perpetually overheated) cool and comfortable!!
Would definitely stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","If your traveling to Memphis this is the place to stay! Cadillac cottage is a cozy little retreat tucked away in the historic Cooper-Young Neighborhood. It’s in a great location close to fantastic local restaurants and coffee shops. It’s also just a quick drive/Uber ride to downtown, Graceland, or Overton Park. Chris and his wife, Debbie are excellent hosts! They are quick to respond and make sure you have everything you may need. There was a bad storm the first night of our stay. Some of the debri caused damage to our car. Even though Chris and Debbie were not, in any way, at fault they were more than willing to help us get our car fixed. They went above and beyond for us. 5 star hosts for sure! We hope to return in the future!"

Stayed a few nights","If you are the type of person with the “service is everything” mentality, this is the place for you then! Chris is a tremendous host. Could not have been any better. Replied quickly and efficiently and did not seem bothered by any of our questions in the slightest bit. We felt very safe in this home and enjoyed every bit of our stay. The reviews about the bathroom being very small are true— but was not really a problem for us because it’s not that big of a deal for just a few nights. Overall everything was perfect. We did have a bit of an ant problem in the kitchen our first night, but it had rained a lot in Memphis and we understand that ants happen. Chris was so kind to come and spray the home for us while we were gone and left us spray in case we would need it again. Talk about above and beyond. Next time we are in Memphis we will have a home of our own to stay in, but I would absolutely stay here again if that weren’t the case. I recommend this place over and over!"

Stayed over a week","My stay at Cadillac Cottage was a delightful experience. Chris and Debbie are incredibly responsive and seemed very concerned that everything was as I wanted and needed. The cottage was clean and had everything I needed for my three-week stay. All linens were excellent, the bed comfortable, and the kitchen easy to use, with everything I needed for preparing meals. The cottage is in an extremely convenient part of Memphis; the neighborhood was very quiet during my stay, though one can hear air traffic and train traffic a few times each day. I actually enjoy hearing trains in the distance! Not at all disruptive. I appreciated everything the hosts did to make my stay comfortable, safe, and trouble-free. I particularly appreciated an umbrella left for my use and the motion-sensitive light on the parking side of the cottage--made coming and going after dark a breeze."

Off street parking for one car.

Stayed with kids","Pros: The cottage is in an excellent location for a short stay in Memphis. A quick drive from the city, where everything is easy to get to. It is also in a comfortable neighborhood with a couple of the ""go to"" Memphis restaurants immediately nearby. Chris is very responsive which was nice.
Possible Improvements: Water never really warmed up for showers. We let Chris know after the 1st day, and he immediately came out and checked it. The next time we used the shower we were on the way out, and we did not notice a difference. Also, the bathroom is a tight squeeze. If you are in the ""big and tall"" category, it would be challenging for you use the restroom.
Compared to other listings we looked at in similar price ranges, you get a lot out of the cottage. Location, privacy, and responsive host. We enjoyed our time."

Stayed a few nights","The cottage was pretty much as expected. The interior is very clean and the decor is nice. The bathroom, however, is really small and for anyone 6 foot or taller its very hard to use the toilet. I think for most men on a quick 1-2 day stay it is probably adequate but think a couple staying there would probably not find the bathroom space acceptable. I gave it 4 stars for this reason and that the shower water never got warm enough to take a good shower, especially for how cold it was there for my stay (first week of Nov). Check in was easy and the communication was great."

Stayed a few nights","We arrived later in the evening and as we approached the area, some of the houses were not well kept (closer to the main street). We did start to hyperventilate a little, UNTIL we got closer to where the property is located. The street is wonderful and as we explored we found that we were in the right place for what we wanted to do.
It was warm and humid (Oct!), but the coolers installed, kept us nice and cool. There was coffee available for our use - Yay!!
The place is super clean, soap, shampoo, wifi, tv and nice furniture. There are even some unique items in the place, charming.
The driveway to the parking is narrow, so just follow the instructions and you will find that parking space in the back. We had the best banana pudding and pulled pork nachos at Central Barbecue, long lines, but the food comes out really fast. We visited the hotel where Martin Luther King Jr. was shot - that is a must - Civil Rights Museum!!
Thank you Chris,

Easy check in and out of this gated community with reserved parking. Easy to follow instructions. We felt very safe and at home with the security measures in place. We will always check to see if this wonderful place is available whenever we’re visiting Memphis. Highly recommended for a couple. Just the right amount of space and amenities for short or long term stays. Loved it, Loved it, Loved it!!!!"

That area of Memphis is pretty quiet and not super populated with other people on the street which was surprising given that it’s just a few blocks to Beale St., but no matter — we loved being close to food and activities. The apartment was clean and had sufficient room for the three of us. Thanks for a great stay!"

Stayed about a week","The BoHo Condo was a very comfortable, relaxing stay. Tons of natural light in the morning and a beautiful flow throughout the unit. The linens and kitchen was very well stocked with everything you need to cook and the bed was extremely comfortable. Mallory & Tripp have taken great care in furnishing this unit and making it feel like home. Beale Street, Civil Rights Museum are right around the corner, but it is a desolate area at night which can be a little uneasy. The unit itself was initially hard to find as there are many buildings for one address and one main gate entry. It was impossible coordinating an uber drop off/pick up (*use building 85…as your address). Aside from the confusing address, this was an amazing stay and I will certainly book again later this year!"

It’s comfortable, and a nice location downtown but away from the major action so that you can get a decent night of rest; if that’s what you are looking for. I did love the fact it’s not crammed into a building that doesn’t have good sound proofing so you can’t hear the neighbors which is great. I highly recommend it and look forward to staying again!"

Stayed a few nights",I am not sure if the photos does the place justice. The place is stunning and immaculate. The only thing I did not like was the to do list when leaving. It was helpful and stressful at the same time. It reminded me to do a check. Stressful because I needed to put used dishes in the dishwasher. Not a burden and I didn’t use any dishes but definitely something I wouldn’t want to be responsible for (although I’d do it out of habit anyway). Overall I would give them more than 5 stars if I could. From the time I checked in to the time I left they were helpful and the place was comfortable. It’s a great location downtown with free parking. Check out Cupcake Cuties !!! Omg the place was just what I needed!

Great location very close to Beale Street and the trolleys and right on Main St. With lots of shops and places to eat nearby or just a short trolley ride. We did have a random fire alarm go off one morning that turned out to be for no reason which was obviously no fault of the hosts, just work being done on the building and Netflix stopped working halfway through our trip (password sharing) so that was a bummer but to be fair we did not message the hosts for a temporary passcode because we did not plan to be up much later that evening and didn't expect an immediate response so we just found something else. Overall it was a great experience and I would definitely recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","I really appreciated the accurate descriptions and instructions - all went well - without any issues. The kitchen was well equipped and we made a few of our meals (quality cookware and sharp knives are important but often overlooked in vacation rentals). I appreciated the willingness of the host to help us navigate safely through Memphis. We wanted to explore different neighbourhoods and we did so successfully based on the hosts’ guidance. The proximity of the Metcalfe location to Madison Avenue, Cooper Street and Overton Park creates many diverse experiences, whether you are seeking live music, food, shopping, art or a visit to the Zoo, as well as walking past historic homes. We also stayed in one of the hosts downtown rentals and again the instructions were accurate, the accommodation was as described and well equipped. For the most part it felt safe to be downtown and it was wonderful to compare and contrast the neighbourhoods. We would recommend others stay in either location."

But the real star is the location. It was perfect. A short walk to the Civil Rights Museum (a must see), bars, restaurants and downtown. We always felt very safe. If you want to pick up groceries, go to the South Point Grocery, a few blocks away. It has everything you need from beer and wine to produce, cheese, meats and specialty items. Go to SOB for dinner. It’s great. Pick up a Blueberry Lemon Scone and coffee at Hustle and Dough. Have pizza at Little Italy. It was sublime. Stop for a craft beer at Wise Acre. Go to Sun Studios and then to Graceland, so you’ll know a little history. See the March of the Ducks at the Peabody. Walk across the Harahan Bridge to Arkansas. Have real Memphis BBQ at Charlie Vergos.. So many great things to do at your doorstep. We highly recommend this place."

I was worried about the 3 flights of stairs—-but it made having more “fun” on Beale Street worth it: walking off the extra “fun”! We would definitely stay here again when we visit Beale Street again.

There were light staining on the couch, desk chair, and comforter. However, they did the best in accommodating me with kindness and rectified the situation quickly. This space is gorgeous with 9 windows, exposed brick, and it's a very quiet building which allows for relaxation and rest. The additional gate and door codes helped you feel safe, if you are traveling alone like I did. I was blown away by the decor, and the homey feel. Book with Mallory and Trip, it's SO worth it."

Stayed a few nights","Beautiful, clean, well lit and well thought out space. The unit itself is great and accurately depicted. Unfortunately it is located in an apartment complex that is populated by people who were drunk each night. Each of the three nights between midnight and 3:00am we were awakened by loud people in the hallway, and one night by someone holding our door buzzer down. You are also two blocks from the fire station ( multiple sirens each night )
On a positive note, you are close to Beale street, the civil rights museum, the river front and multiple restaurants. All within walking distance.
So if the nighttime interruptions do not bother you, then this beautiful space is highly recommended."

If you like to cook, this may not be the unit for you as the kitchen is set up for minimal prep. There are lots of linens and the clothes washer was handy as we were on our 8th day of travel. We like to read most days and finding a comfortable chair or good reading light was not possible. The walk up the stairs was only 2 flights the way I count them…the first floor involves no stairs."

Stayed a few nights","Mallory &Tripp’s Boho apartment was just as described in the listing! The loft was very chic and stylishly appointed. The location cannot be beat, just a half block off of Main Street, about 2 blocks from an adorable river walk along the Mississippi and only about a 6 minute walk to Beale street. There were several wonderful places to eat very close by (We loved the Slider Inn, Gus’s Chicken and Cupcake Cutie), a full service movie theater within walking distance and a couple cute boutique type shops. The living room couch was comfy, the bathroom was very modern and the bedroom was spacious. The bed linens were very luxurious, the bed was comfortable, and there was lots of closet space. The room can be a bit bright at night (street lights) and in the morning so if you are light sensitive bring a sleep mask. The kitchen was fine for light cooking, we made breakfast every day, but cooking is not what you are in Memphis for anyways! Communication was excellent before and during our stay. We love this apartment and Memphis and hope to come back to both again!"

We had a late check-in due to travel and the instructions were clear and easy to follow. Parking is gated. The unit is conveniently located in proximity to shopping and restaurants. It is a third floor unit so be prepared for stairs. The living room sofa and rug had stains and could use a professional cleaning. Other than that the property was clean. The shower pressure wasn't the best, but after a long day of travel it was much appreciated to have a clean, spacious, and well stocked bathroom. Overall good stay. Would stay at one of Mallory and Tripp's properties again."

Group trip",This house is immaculate! It is so big and spacious. My family all came together to celebrate my son going to prom and there was plenty of room for everybody. The back yard is amazing and there is plenty of parking including a 3 car garage. There was so much room that my family and my son’s friends were all able to enjoy themselves in separate rooms of the house without it being overcrowded. We played games and we got pretty loud in the front and the people in the bedrooms or media room could not hear us! John was also very accommodating and communicated everything to us very well. The check in process was seamless. The kitchen is also stocked very well. I forgot a couple of items and everything I needed he had. We really enjoyed our stay and will definitely be booking again!

The location was central to everything we were doing and the host was very responsive. There were a few items that were running low or missing (shampoo, conditioner, laundry pods, etc.), but host was able to direct us to spares for the most part. Great property for the price!"

Stayed a few nights","I really loved and enjoyed this home. Friends and I met here for a yoga retreat, and it was the perfect space for us. Everyone loved the bedroom. They are large and spacious and the beds are very comfortable. We also really enjoyed the spaciousness of the living room and dining room. It made hanging out so much easier, because even in a large group no one felt on top of each other. People had enough space to move around or hang out in a large group in the same room. The kitchen was absolutely perfect for making large meals, and it was a joy to cook there. I also have to say that I was a huge fan of the cool, vintage touches in the game room. You just have to see some of the collectibles to believe it! I appreciated John’s timely responses. He was extremely helpful when I had to reschedule the booking because of a snow storm, and very gracious with out check out. I would definitely book again, and look forward to returning!"

We were able to play games in the Billiard room, watch movies in the TV room or have conversations in the living room and kitchen while the 15 of us joined together for a funeral. It had more than enough bathrooms for each of us to get ready for the funeral all at the same time and we never ran out of hot water. The kitchen and dining room was large enough to prepare a large meal and all gather to eat at same time. Every question was answered immediately and John was an amazing host. The house and grounds are beautifully decorated and the beds very comfortably."

John was flexible and understanding with checkin and checkout times especially as we had last minute travel changes due to the snow storm. We had a mixed group of ages from kids to teens to adults and everyone had a great time! John was a great communicator and responded within minutes which was very helpful due to the crazy weather!

Some small niggles - can’t use fireplaces, not a ton of accessories (though we left a hair dryer and corkscrew for anyone else staying!), need to take sheets off and put towels in washer (which isn’t bad but given price point could be included).
No question a five star place though. We absolutely loved it!"

The beds are very comfortable, seating is plentiful throughout the home, & lots of cozy throws are available. The kitchen is bright with lovely, high-end appliances. The fridge is large enough to meet the needs of a very large group! Also, the tucked away bar with glassware was a nice surprise. Just off the kitchen is the sunroom which overlooks the peaceful backyard. There, we enjoyed our morning coffee. The home includes a game room as well as a media room we found quite enjoyable.
These 2 rooms in particular with their large televisions were great for watching college football during our stay, although practically every room in the house has a tv. This home possesses so many features, I cannot possibly mention them all. To end, two words-rent it!"

That said, I have never been so taken with a locale and it's proprietors as I was with Pixie and Richard's artist's garret, located in the most charming, tree-lined, antebellumesque neighborhood we could have hoped for.
I mean... Wow! The room was just the right size, eminating a cozy vibe while spacious enough to move about unfettered throughout the well-appointed apartment. Our hosts, Pixie, Richard and their two charming canine companions (Baxter and his young ward, Bailey), provided us with everything we could have needed. Big screen TV (check!), Microwave and Fridge (Check!), Snacks (Check!), Beautiful, art museum-worthy original oil paintings (Check!), Beautiful flowers and plants (Check!) Reading material, (Check!). The linnens were crisp and the towels were plush. It was a beautiful space. I could go on and on. However, brevity dictates I conclude with... Our hosts went above and beyond. WE WILL BE BACK"

It's a beautiful place, a former art studio once used by Pixie's mother -- pleasant, comfortable, peaceful, in a residential neighborhood very convenient to the airport, downtown, Overton Park and Graceland. Lots of restaurants nearby, some of them within walking distance. Pixie grew up in the house and will tell you all you want to know about her family's interesting history there. Visiting with her and Richard was a delightful part of my stay. If you're traveling solo as I was, or as a couple, you will not find better accommodations in Memphis."

When visiting Memphis, choose only one place when considering accommodation - Pixie and Richard’s. This is a superior Air BnB in a beautiful and historic part of the old city, a genuine home from home, a delight, a gem.
We were immediately made most welcome and made to feel at home, but with privacy at the forefront of our stay here. Pixie and Richard couldn’t do enough for us and provided us with any and all assistance during our fantastic stay in Memphis. The room was cosy, spotless and inviting, the bathroom and shower equally spotless and well equipped with towels, toiletries and light.
We’d like to thank our hosts for looking after us and setting such a wonderful example of Southern hospitality - yes, of course we’ll be telling all of our friends back home in Scotland.

The kitchen was well equipped and the snacks and breakfast items were much appreciated.
Super soft, thick towels were supplied as well as toiletries.
They really have thought of everything.
We would definitely choose Pixie And Richard's place on our next visit to Memphis."

Even though the room is connected to their house, I felt great privacy. When I wasn’t home they even washed my dishes which was so sweet of them! I only stayed a few days, but on the last day they made sure I was getting to where I needed to go safely and even gave me a ride. They were above and beyond hosts. Will stay there again."

Stayed one night","My husband and I stayed here for a little staycation away from our two young kids. Here’s what we thought:
Pros:
-Pixie and Richard were extremely friendly and responsive.
-the place had thoughtful amenities including a variety of drinks and snacks.
- it was easy to find.
-it was very clean.
- the bed was quite comfortable.
-it was warm and cozy even in a cold winter day.
Cons:
- you do not have the “entire place to yourself.” I always filter on Airbnb to have the entire place, and this said we would have the entire guest suite. However, the guest suite is connected to the main house with a door that only locks from the host side.
I have never stayed in an Airbnb before in which you couldn’t lock all access points to your room.
Overall a fairly pleasant stay, but we will find another place to stay in the future."

Pixie provided so many little bathroom amenities and snacks which make a stay that much more comfortable. We loved getting to meet her and chat at several points during our stay, but also felt like we had privacy. It was a perfect balance.

Stayed a few nights","The stay with Pixie and Richard was truly a delightful Airbnb experience. One of the best! It’s like staying at your grandparents house for the weekend (and I hope they don’t mind me saying that since they actually do have grandkids lol). You’re never too old to receive the love and care that they have to give. Also, they literally put so much care into the space. It’s like a studio apartment with everything you need: clean bathroom, perfectly comfortable mattress, big screen tv, small fridge and microwave and plenty of snacks! They could easily charge more, but the price, space and location will definitely have me booking again since I do have family in the area. Go ahead and take the time to READ ALL Of the house rules and instructions, it truly is an experience and it’s worth it. Highly recommend but just let their ratings speak for them."

Stayed a few nights","Pixie met us as soon as we arrived and though earlier than expected, she was ready for us and extremely accommodating. After showing us around our room and going over several maps she had prepared of the midtown and downtown areas, she offered to drive us downtown to our first destination. She went out of her way to give us a brief tour so we could get our bearings.
We stayed for 4 nights and the room was so well set up, beautifully decorated with her mother's art work and very comfortable. We had everything we needed in a very organized and efficient space. Each day she resupplied us with water, snacks and coffee pods to get us going.
Pixie is so kind, & very knowledgeable about areas of interest whether museums, music attractions or food. We had a list of placed we wanted to go but she had many other great suggestions for us and helped us plan out timing based on her experience. She loved hearing about places we explored that she hadn't yet been to as well. Loved our stay!"

This place has everything anyone could ever want in an Airbnb...... everything. We like a good, clean place with all the bells and whistles as much as the next guy. But what does it for us are the people we meet during our stay. Believe me when I say, this couple is worth meeting. Words really can't express how great our experience was here.

The artwork really made the stay unique and I even got a write up in the visitor's folder to give me a little history. So cool!

I work at the hospital and needed some time to relax and refresh myself. Having coffee out on her beautiful patio each morning as the waterfall filled the air with relaxing sounds made the tranquil atmosphere just what I needed. They have thought of everything and have supplied the unit not only with beautiful furnishings but with everything a traveler may need or forgot to pack. The neighborhood is perfect to walk and Pixie gave us useful information on where to find the best places to eat nearby and the easiest way to navigate the area to get to our destinations. Richard and Pixie are truly amazing and the pictures do not do this awesome place justice. We will come back and visit again. I give this place a 10 out of 10 stars!!!

It was wonderful, they were so kind, and we will absolutely be staying with them again the next time we're in Memphis. Our stay with them is exemplary of the reason we stay with Airbnb, and what we wish more Airbnbs were: an opportunity to stay with someone who knows and loves the locale we're visiting while providing a private place to respite and stage our exploration from. Thank you to you both so much!!"

Stayed a few nights","Pixie and Richard’s place was exactly what I needed after experiencing the wonderful and alive, hustle and bustle of Downtown Memphis. Pixie was a sweetheart and carted me to Graceland and the airport even though she was well aware that my company would pay for alternative transportation. She told me “she liked to get to know her guests and about their experiences in her city”.
This place has a heart and soul. The history of the home and the story and art of her incredibly talented mother made their place an extraordinarily unique find. Highly recommended if this is your jam! There are a handful of excellent spots for all your needs very close by.
I want to go back.

P.S. Pixie, even though all the pillows on the bed are cute, it’s a little much. 😉"

She had lots of snacks, coffee and tea which made our 3 year old very happy! Their home is in such a wonderful location for walking to the park or walking to dinner. And the artwork was stunning!!

Stayed one night","If you’re looking for a more traditional bed and breakfast experience, where there is much interaction with the hosts, this is the place for you.
If you desire privacy, control of the room temperature (they control the thermostat), and are looking for a bit of anonymity, keep looking. You’ll not find that here.
The pictures definitely do the place justice. It’s decorated beautifully and is immaculate. There are many thoughtful amenities; and, the hosts are very kind.
It may be a delight to any extrovert or to anyone looking to feel like they’re visiting out-of-town relatives.
For the introverts writing this review, the experience wasn’t private enough; and, the room was way too warm."

It’s in a super cute neighborhood called the historical Garden District and the houses are 100 years old and older. The bed was super comfortable in the garden outside of my front door. Was a perfect touch after driving all day. I thought I would go out and explore a little bit but it was so comfortable. I ended up just staying in and watching Netflix in bed. I felt at home! I loved that they left snacks and drinks in the mini fridge as well as a fully stocked coffee bar. You can tell how much they love to be hosts, and these are the exact people that I love to stay with.❤️ thank you Pixie and Richard !"

Stayed one night","Pixie and Richard and their fur-babies , Daisy and Baxter, welcomed us into their home as if we were family. All the amenities were above and beyond of what you could imagine. The detailed books that were in the Airbnb were a great help in planning our day. Highly recommend this place. We would definitely stay here again if ever in the Memphis area."

Stayed a few nights",The location worked well for us and enjoyed walking to shops and restaurants. Loved the patio and wished the weather would have cooperated so we could have relaxed outside! The description of this airbnb is accurate and we felt it was a great value. I was traveling alone with my daughter so it made me feel comfortable knowing Pixie and Richard were nearby if needed and were gracious hosts. I appreciated the amenities and happy to have a few toiletries that I had forgotten at home (toothbrush and ibuprofen). Thank you for a lovely stay.

Stayed one night","Our stay at Pixie and Richard’s was very peaceful. If you’re looking for a friendly and special stay in a historic neighborhood, I highly recommend. We were greeted warmly by them and their doggo, and Pixie had some great recommendations for our one night stay. The private entrance while still being attached to their house was so ideal for us. Their location is very central to downtown while being outside the bustle of it, and their historic neighborhood is BEAUTIFUL. We joked about wanting to extend our stay for longer!"

Jon and Shaun had the washer and dryer set up and detergent, toilet paper, paper towels etc. I will definitely stay at their other properties when I come to Memphis again. Walking distance from all of the hot spots. We were able to catch an amazing Memphis Grizzlies game at the FedEx Forum and visited the Memphis rock 'n' soul museum!

Stayed a few nights","Queen's Gambit is very conveniently located within walking distance to museums, Beale Street and restaurants. We never moved our car once it was parked. The neighborhood ""looks"" a little sketchy, but it's not with some really nice restaurants and bars just a block or two away. We highly recommend the Rock and Soul museum and you can't come to Memphis and not go to the National Civil Rights museum. Since we were there during the week, there wasn't as much music going on, but we had a very enjoyable time at BB King's with good food and live music.
The apartment is on the second floor, so there are stairs involved. I would only caution anyone over 6 ft tall and is a back sleeper that the bed, though really comfortable is a California king on a regular king bed frame...so the end of the bed is sitting on top of the end of the frame and is raised so your feet are up higher. For everyone else, it will be great.
Hosts were really responsive when we had questions...highly recommend!"

With a quick walk, we were surrounded by food, Beale street, and the rest of downtown. The street is quiet, parking was a breeze, and I have never felt more safe staying at an AirBnB. Jon made check out easy and quick, and he was a great communicator. Easiest and best booking I’ve made in a while! We can’t wait to come back to Memphis and stay here again!"

Short walk to FedEx Forum, Beale Street, Civil Rights Museum, farther but walkable to AutoZone Park, and of course only a few blocks from Beale Street. The space is a little on the small side from what I am used to, but you don’t go to Memphis to spend time in your room anyway. I would highly recommend this location and the Airbnb in particular. Secure parking and easy access."

Jon was very direct and on time with any check-in details. They provide any cleaning material needed. There are two smart tvs connected to the wifi. Plenty of space to LIVE for a few days. We had enough room to fully unpack and actually enjoy the time without fighting over space. The fact that it is in a gated community with off street parking while only being a few blocks from downtown (Beale) is tremendous. Jon is quick to reply if we had a concern and helped us to feel appreciated and welcome. We were so happy with our stay we actually went a couple steps above and beyond the checkout list, which is literally only a couple things to do anyway!
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will absolutely be shooting for this place if we are ever in town again."

Parking is quite inexpensive in Memphis, especially during the week you can find free parking. Closer to the apartment is the Overton center (about 3-5 minutes) , where you can find restaurants with live music, among other things. We felt very comfortable and can fully recommend the apartment."

Stayed a few nights","This is a lovely place to stay if you want to avoid hotels.
I loved being in a neighborhood. I hung out on the porch several times and even walked the lovely neighborhood one afternoon. It was close to everywhere I needed to go.
I had one issue that the host was very responsive and reasonable in providing resolution options.
I would recommend it to others as there are so many wonderful things about the place!"

Stayed a few nights","I had the pleasure of staying at Lauren's house recently and it truly exceeded all my expectations. This is hands down one of the best experiences I've had with Airbnb. One of the standout features is the high level of privacy - you don't have to share the space with the owners, making for a very comfortable and relaxing stay.
Thoughtful touches didn't go unnoticed either - there was plenty of water, soda and coffee, which added a homey and functional feel to our stay. The location couldn't be better. It's perfect for exploring downtown Memphis and the nearby museums and restaurants.
Without a doubt, my wife and I are already planning our return trip. Thank you host for such a great experience. We can't wait to come back!"

Some things that stood out: good host communication, a very comfortable king sized bed and pillows with quality linens, spotless bathroom, and a quiet neighborhood. Everything worked as expected, from the key code check-in to the wifi to the coffee maker. Well done!"

It was a good location for being in a quieter area, but walkable to Overton square which is lovely for restaurants /bars and then drivable to Graceland.
The sheets were also maybe the softest sheets we have ever experienced!! Whatever your secret is please tell us 😆
Lovely place to stay and highly recommend. Thanks so much!"

Stayed one night","Lauren's place was clean and very spacious. The kitchenette had coffee , tea, and sweeteners. The bed was clean and comfy and the room was tastefully decorated. The only thing I had trouble figuring out was...where in world were my towels and washcloth? Fortunately, there was a hand towel and I made use of it. Also, most airbnbs that I have stayed in provided soap and shampoo in the shower. Hmmmm, maybe these were in the same place as the towels? Anyway, besides that, Lauren's place was a happy choice for me. The neighborhood is beautifully landscaped and the front porch is inviting. Thank you. Sincerely, Grace Hamilton"

Unfortunately, the pillows still had a residual scent in them even with fragrance free pillowcases. When I contacted Lauren about it she immediately offered me a spare pillow that was new in bag. Super comfortable and quiet. Will happily stay here again when I need to attend a family Event."

It’s just a beautiful private space with everything you need. I stayed for almost a week, and only left a couple of times. We had bad weather, but the space is so warm and cosy that even if the weather was nice, I would’ve hesitated or go out!
Really nice work space (as I had lots of work to do).
Lauren happily extended my stay for me as soon as I asked, and then asked me if there was anything else she could get me.
She is a super host!

There were plenty of extra towels && little soaps. The bed was a King && it was very comfortable with a super cozy blanket. They also had little snacks && sodas which makes everything so much more worth it. Overall 10/10"

Stayed a few nights","Great stay, Property is well maintained, very clean and true to the inline pictures. ! My husband and I we’re celebrating our anniversary and stayed here. The directions were great and clear instructions once we got inside.
My only issue was the very thin door to the suite, I could hear the hosts coming and going in the adjacent part of the house opposite of the suite.
So it’s not very sound proof, also a dog was barking in a adjacent property. I’m a light sleeper and when it’s quiet you can hear more including planes traveling over head to the Fed Ex forum.
but I would definitely still recommend this property for the value and comfort of the room if the other minor things don’t bother you"

Stayed a few nights","This is a perfect little studio-ish place for a weekend! Wi-fi was fast enough for two of us to work during the day, and the king bed was very comfy. The bar and vanity made good work spots, and the tea/coffee and snacks were a nice touch! We loved the neighborhood, it was peaceful and felt very safe."

Stayed one night","The accommodation was really super nice, clean, you have everything you need!
The only drawback: at night the fridge was really extremely loud, which was really disruptive and I had to sleep in Ears.
Otherwise everything was nice and I would come back again!"

Stayed one night","We came into town to tour Graceland. This was perfect because it was so close. Lauren left the outside light on for us because we didn’t arrive until 10pm. 😍
They have created a cute manual with local recommendations and check out instructions. Loved that personal touch!
They had snacks, water and coffee ready for us. The bed was super comfy!
I would stay here in a heartbeat next time I’m in Memphis!!!!"

(*my personal favorite was the lint roller!) It’s a quiet neighborhood, felt safe to park etc. We didn’t get to meet but Lauren is very nice and prompt with responding! We highly recommend and would definitely stay again shall we happen to be in Memphis! Close to everything, beautiful little home away from home!"

Stayed a few nights","This gem of a place was absolutely wonderful & I HIGHLY recommend staying here! Everything was spot on as described & shown in the listing. I felt so safe here, very cute neighborhood with gorgeous trees all around. The suite was spotlessly clean, very charming & SO cozy. The bed was so spacious & VERY comfy. Loved all the extra thoughtful touches & has everything you need. Communication was perfect & easy. One thing to note if you are a light sleeper, a few times in the night you can hear a train horn in the distance, as well as some light noise from the house but that was very minimal. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again! You will love this sweet spot!"
