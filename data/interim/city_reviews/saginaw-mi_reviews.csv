Stayed over a week","Place was very nice and quiet. I couldn't tell from the photos, but there is a TV near the bed, and then one in the cabinet downstairs. Bed is firm, so recommend using the extra blanket if didn't bring an extra one yourself. Was able to set the temperature to what I like. Everything you need to cook is there. Not so much for baking, or I might be blind lol. couldn't find measurement cups and/or spoons. I packed light for this trip, was visiting family in the area. The location was easy to find and get to. Very much enjoyed my stay."

Stayed one night","I booked this place based on the rating. What I walked into was not what I expected, was far below my expectations, and my 3-night reservation turned into a 1-night stay. The stairs leading to the decking for the entrance to the side door are broken and the decking in the back is spongy in some spots. Overall, the decking is neglected and unsafe in some spots. The floors were not clean, specifically in the kitchen area. The A/C unit and/or the thermostat were broken. It was disturbing to see the thermostat had been modified with a toggle switch on the side, and packing tape was wrapped around the thermostat to keep it somewhat in place. It took more time to wire up the toggle switch and tape it to the thermostat than it would have to purchase and install a new unit. The hot water side of the kitchen faucet was not functioning properly. Slats in the blinds were broken. The toilet seat was loose in the bathroom and there was hair in the sink.
In addition, If you like to sleep in the dark, this place is not a good fit. Directly over the bed is a skylight and a majority of the windows located on the upper part of the walls (which cast light into the bedroom) don't have any type of covering on them. In the late spring/summer this presents a problem since it's light by 6:00 a.m.
On the plus side, once the owners responded to my concerns, they agreed to refund the remainder of my stay. I do hope the owners address the issues that caused me to leave early, it could be a nice place and it's in a good location."

The hosts were very welcoming and responsive via the app. Lots of amenities. There is a small size glass opening in the cieling above the bed that didn't bother me at all as I am an early riser anywyas. Overall highly recommended and will definitely consider them for future stays."

Stayed about a week","This is a nice space overall. The furnishing and bed are comfortable. There are three skylights, one right over the bed, that bathe the space in light, what light is to be had in a Michigan winter. This was a bit of a challenge for me, as I was there on business, working night and sleeping during the days, but a sleep mask worked fine. In the afternoons, when I woke up, the space was always bright and cheery. The location is great, about 10 minutes from downtown. The hosts were responsive and made sure my needs were met."

Not only was this place an emergency respite for my family when we needed it most, Paul went 1000% above and beyond to make sure my disabled mom had everything she needed. He was incredibly attentive, respectful, and helpful. The duplex is what you'd expect for that area of Saginaw but you can tell time, effort, and care is taken to make it as comfortable and home-like as possible. 10/10 would and will recommend :)"

It stated it needed descaled and we had no idea how to do this, we in turn found a Tim Horntons near by and they have divine coffee. also, note there are quite a few low lying areas in the back yard making for standing water and muddy doggies.

However, due to previous guest and their fur babies, there was a scent of pets. But because our ""little girls"" are part of our family, it would not keep us from coming back for another stay."

Stayed with a pet","This was my first time staying at an AirBNB and I had a wonderful experience. As a host, James was very friendly and extremely responsive. For check in, getting into the house was a breeze.
The house and neighborhood were exactly as described. The house was clean and well kept. It is charmingly decorated and very comfortable. Everything works as it should. The neighborhood was lovely - on a quiet street surrounded by many other quiet streets where I could easily and safely take my dogs for a walk. And all the neighbors we passed were very friendly as we walked by.
I was traveling with my dogs and this was a truly dog friendly house. There were bowls for water in the kitchen and many other little signs that dogs were welcome. And the spacious fenced in back yard was a real treat! I almost never have that when I travel with my dogs!
The dogs and I had a wonderful stay and I would absolutely stay at this home again should my travels take my dogs and me back to the area."

Not far from Frankenmuth and Birch Run. The actual neighborhood the house is in is a nice, quite neighborhood. It is 100% worth the listed nightly price. If I needed a place to stay in the area in the future, I would definitely stay there again. Especially if traveling with my dogs."

Stayed with a pet","I was able to reserve last minute for a family funeral. Reserving was easy enough; however there was an additional rental agreement we had to sign after reserving through Airbnb that we did not know about until after paying.
We always stay in pet-friendly Airbnbs and know what comes with them. I was disappointed upon first entering to notice a very distinct pet urine smell throughout the house. The house was decently clean but there was dirt and leaves and pet hair.
With a $100 cleaning fee I definitely was mostly disappointed by the smell.
In the end it was still a decent place for us to stay. The house was nicely decorated, the beds were comfy, and our dogs enjoyed the fenced in backyard!"

Stayed with a pet",The house was as it was described in the listing. Large and lots of space. Our issue was the smell and animal hair and dust in piles around and under the furniture. We knew going in this was a pet friendly home but the smell was terrible. It smelt like cats and dogs had urinated on all surfaces and it hadn’t been properly clean. As soon as we got there we had to open all windows and still that did not help. There were air fresheners placed all around the house that made the smell worse. We would not recommended this home to anyone. As soon as we checked in we checks out.

There is a grocery store less than two minutes away, lots of everything locally and for us, being 23 minutes from Frankenmuth which was the whole point of the trip. We had so much fun and got to see everything and then come back to James's house and relax and plan for the next day. We enjoyed our stay and appreciated all of his hospitality and we even got some very yummy cookies! This is the place to stay for your next trip to Saginaw and the surrounding area and omg..if you are going to go to Frankenmuth for a few days, stay here!!!! You can spend your extra money in one of the shops..lol"

Stayed with a pet","James was a great host. The house we stayed in was in a quiet older neighborhood. We were visiting the Saginaw Vally State University, and it was a 13 minute easy drive back and forth.
Krogers was right across the street from the house and lovely little mom and pop places to eat like Fuzzy’s were great as well as more formal dining like Coty’s were within 7minutes.
James had a book with all of the nearby restaurants, attractions, and house instructions in a nice easy to read notebook. He even left goodies for us.
The home is in need of some updating, but it is easy to see that James’ goal is to provide his guest with a comfortable, safe, and quiet stay. We experienced just that.
Thanks James!"

When visiting Saginaw, this location is a solid option. This stay was a reminder to carefully examine all amenities and not make any assumptions about what is/ isn't included. I didn't realize the home didn't have AC until I checked in. Upon review of amenities, I realized AC was excluded therefore I couldn't complain. The temperature wasn't always awful and they provided fans, however, the internal temp didn't drop below 77 during waking hours. Just be mindful to not assume anything about a house. I would stay here again but would be better prepared to ensure personal comfortability ."

Stayed a few nights","First off, our host was extremely attentive and accessible, I am certain that had we needed anything she would have moved the heavens and earth to accommodate our needs, however the property is well supplied and there was nothing we needed. She was clear, prompt and on point with access and stay information. Two thumbs up!
The house is comfortable and nicely decorated and made us feel right at home. We only cooked a few meals and we had everything we needed.
The location is perfect for our needs, and near many good restaurants.
We will definitely put this at the top of our list for our future stays."

The house was clean, I had complete freedom in my room, I could completely use the kitchen and I was in a very good neighbourhood. My host family was very kind, sincere and they helped me everytime I had a problem with adapting to the region. I even learned the location of the closest market and bus stop from them. They also give 2 bottles of water in the beginning of every rotation and put toilet tissue to the bathroom whenever you need it. The natural habitat in the garden was also well preserved- with wild rabbits, squirrels, birds, an oak tree, pine trees and more."

Everything was simply wonderful. Emily and Perry and such kind hearted and positive people.
They have been running this AirBnB for quite a while now so everything has been worked out to the smallest detail.
Room was spacious and clean, tasty vitamin water and snacks were waiting for me when I arrived. Private bathroom was perfect.
Kitchen has everything you need, another big thank you to the hosts for letting us use everything from coffee mugs to baking pans and the oven.
It was always nice running into Emily while cooking in the kitchen or pulling up in the driveway, we’d always find an interesting topic to talk about.
If you need a place to stay and want it to feel like your home away from home, this is the place to rent! Highly highly recommended!
Wishing them all the best, thank you again for everything from the muffins to winter coats and the little present.
Love,
Maddie (and Edgar)."

I have found great friends that I will keep in touch with! Jenny and LP are genuinely kind people and treat their guests as if they are family.
The rooms are private. There were several other guests that stayed in their second room while I was there, and even though I had to share a bathroom, I barely even noticed there was another person. There’s a coffee station, popcorn, and if you are lucky, Jenny will cook cupcakes. Yum!
Thanks you guys for making my transition so comfortable. XOXO"

She signed me up and quickly found the most charming room and host imaginable in a quaint little community. Although I didn't meet Emily, who by the way responded immediately to my request and questions, her mother was very welcoming, charming and a wonderful host. I would recommend staying here if you're in Saginaw."

The guest rooms are on the opposite side from the family quarters so any interaction you choose to have is up to you. the room is oversized and immaculate. The large driveway ensures all cars are off the street. I used my kitchen privilege to enjoy a real dinner.
Thanks, Emily, for a fantastic stay."

Stayed a few nights","The house is in a quiet neighborhood. The place is 20 minutes away from Saginaw Valley State University. Resraunts and shopping that I found are also about 20 minute drive away.
The listing does not entirely live up to the description.
During my three day stay the living room was off limits. Lots of packed up boxes, messy and unwelcoming. When I arrived bathroom was unclean. Same deal with the kitchen. The listing does not mention that the room is right next to another room, which is being used as a separate listing for other renters. During my stay the adjescent room was continuosly occupied.
I was met at the door, but not by the listing's host. I arrived after 11 p. m., and could still get in, which is great. There was a parking spot. In general, the place left an impression of not quite having lived up to the description."

Stayed with kids","The Alvin St. house was a really wonderful stay. We knew we did not want to stay in a hotel for two nights with our kids, that we wanted them to have more space and have some quiet time in the evenings. The kitchen was very nice and we made a couple of meals while we were there, which is such a perk to an Air BNB. We went to college in this area so we are very familiar with the location but it is super close to everything, centrally located.
The rooms were clutter free and spacious.
The bathrooms were very clean and the towels were really nice, which is a perk as well.
The only feedback I have for someone looking to stay here, is that this is a pet friendly home and we could smell the smell of dog when we arrived. We do not have pets so it was noticeable to us, but not so terrible that we were upset.
Overall a nice stay in a cute house."

Talking about Rebecca, she’s not just a good host but a great human being above all. I was trying to book a cab for almost 3 hours (4:30-7:30am) but nothing seemed to work and I had a flight to catch at 10. I asked Rebecca for help and she took this upon her and decided to come all the way to Detroit to drop me at the airport. I was running out of time and it’s takes around 2 hours to reach the DTW airport from Saginaw. Rebecca was bang on, she got me exactly at 9:30 to the airport and my flight was around 10 pm. Although I missed the flight by a whisker but I was amazed at Rebecca’s kind behaviour. Although I felt bad for causing all the trouble, but Rebecca didn’t mind helping.
May god bless her. I ll surely stay here again whenever m in Saginaw."

I was in the area for a conference and her place was quiet and convenient. I highly recommend Boho Airbnb

The people that wanted to go to bed a little early had no trouble with conversation or noise traveling upstairs. The beds are comfortable, the linens are quality, the decor is minimal but very nice and the kitchen is well stocked. There were lots of live plants around, which was nice.
The only (and I mean only) downside is that the door knobs are loud when you turn them, so anyone sneaking in or out of a room during the night can be heard. Otherwise with a little bathroom logistical planning and consideration with the door knobs we had a fabulous stay and would definitely consider coming back in the future!"

We traveled no more than 5 minutes from the home to reach our destinations of choice. The home is immaculately clean and spacious. I absolutely love the greenery/plants scattered about the home. Plant life makes the hkme feel like home and connected to nature. Id definitely book this home again if ever in Saginaw area. Carrie definitely gets a 10 out of 10 from me!

The first day of our stay it rained all day, but we had plenty of room to visit in the living area and dining area. The next evening we enjoyed sitting on the front porch as the weather was just perfect. We arrived a little early, and since the house was ready, Carrie let us check in a little early, which was greatly appreciated.
Everything was perfect! I hope to stay there again when we get back to MI, and I know my brother and sister in law will recommend the home to others when they visit. The best part was the affordable price! Can't beat it!"

Stayed over a week","This was my longest AirBnB booking by far, and I would stay at Earnie's Place again in a heartbeat. The kitchen had everything I needed to cook exactly what I wanted. The market two blocks away had a great selection of good quality produce, and almost everything else I would buy at much larger supermarkets near my hone. I appreciated that I was within 15 minutes of any place I might want to go in Saginaw, and just as close to my dad's homestead in Albee. It will be a real treat when the construction is done on Sheridan.
The host's communication during my stay was perfect: quite attentive without being intrusive. The decor felt very homey and welcoming, and there were gorgeous linens galore. I liked that there was hard flooring throughout--no carpet--making it easy to quickly clean the floor with just a broom and Swiffer on my long stay. I appreciated the selection of books and other reading material, including local themed cookbooks.
I felt so at home, and I can't wait to return!"

The price was right and I was pleased to find it at the last minute. My sister, my husband and I enjoyed the place and will consider it for a future visit.
One sweet touch that I never experienced from other Airbnb was that the host asked me if I wanted things to drink and provided waters, sodas, chips and mint candies. That made us special!
It was very thoughtful of asking and the bottles of water was what we needed after a long drive.
Also, the Christmas lights were inviting and a great surprise. Thank you so much for making our time out of home like it was our home."

Cozy, welcoming and super clean are the best words I can think of when we entered. The pictures on the website are exactly what you will find inside. Attention to detail is an understatement, Lois has put alot of effort into making it perfect. Fresh cut flowers on the kitchen table welcome you along with a treat waiting for you on the countertop too!
We enjoy traveling with our dog and Lois has that covered too, feeding bowls, blankets and a dog bed.
Overall, we had a great time in the area and a wonderful place to stay at."

We stayed in the Hulda Rm which was cozy but still comfortable and lots of nice touches. We walked around the grounds and then went into Old Town , just 5 minutes away, to have dinner and a drink. We felt safe and enjoyed the ambiance. Room temp was fine but the room included a fan, which we used, just because we both like to have white noise at night but we slept very well and never heard a peep. In the morning there was a full breakfast made from scratch: scrambled eggs, sausage patties, fruit, mini pancakes, breakfast potatoes, along with cereal and milk. We had checked out and were pulling out of the driveway when I got a call about a top that I had left in the room. They ran out and handed it to me before we even had a chance to go back in. Would highly recommend!"

The room & bathroom were clean & the bed was comfortable. Breakfast was really good with a lot of selections of food & beverages. All the employess were friendly. We really enjoyed our stay & would stay again if back in the area.

Stayed a few nights","This bed and breakfast is a beautiful place to stay. Naomi and Benjamin made me feel like I was at home. I had free rein of taking pictures and wandering around the property. They are close to shopping, parks and the highways.
Can'twait to visit Michigan again and to stay in another room!"

Stayed one night","When we arrived at the Montague Inn we were taken aback. My mom & I were staying here for a concert in downtown which was only a 5 minutes drive away. Not only was it full of history but the scenes around were gorgeous. One of our favorite moments was looking through the books located on the bottom floor & finding so many guest comment books from so many different decades! 💘 we would 100% recommend staying here for your wedding, a cozy weekend or just a night to get away from home! It was exquisite!
Our hot breakfast was delicious, as they had a variety of many different things offered. Waffles, pancakes, sausage, hashbrowns, bagels, coffee, fruit, yogurt! You name it, they were serving!
A huge thank you to the groundskeepers!"

Stayed one night","Everything was great except one issue. First the good: The place itself is beautiful and wonderfully preserved back to its origins. Loved walking around and seeing all the different rooms. The place was clean, and did not have that ""old house"" smell.
Check in was easy and pleasant
Now the bad. And it's the only bad thing. We knew we were going to be spending minimal time in the room for one night so we reserved the small room, the original maids quarters. When we came in to the room that night, the room was warm with the heater going full blast. There is no individual thermostat in the room. We closed the vent but it was blowing so hard, heat was still coming out. We opened a window but it didn't help. It ran all night long. By morning we were sweating like crazy. At checkout we overheard other guest mentioning how warm it was. So I'm assuming it was a furnace issue.

Other than that we loved the place and do plan on returning this summer."
