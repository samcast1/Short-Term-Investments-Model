I didn't have any issues with noise or neighbors, and Amanda left super clear instructions for getting in/out! Super convenient location to downtown or back out to the highway. Also, Momma Goldberg's Deli is walking distance if you need a quick bite!"

Stayed a few nights","Had a lot of issues. The cleaning fee was as much as a two night stay and the space was not professionally cleaned.
No Wi-Fi therefore no tv. The owner went in to fix it but said the HOA owns it so nothing could be done. Based on troubleshooting and checking cables, someone had already tried to solve the issue before we arrived so I don’t believe we were the first to experience the issue. 3 of 4 outlets in the living room didn’t work at all. The light in the bedroom didn’t work. They offered a $75 refund for $400 2 night stay. I was in town for a wedding and didn’t have time to argue with the owner. I waited 2 weeks to write this review to let my frustration subside. This ranks as the lowest of many Airbnb stays."

Owners VERY attentive to your needs. I will definitely stay here again."

I would advise that if you are looking for a place that is walkable to campus that this place is 0.7 miles from the corner of Sanford and S. College Street. I thought it would be closer based on the approximate location that is listed on the AirBnB listing but it was further east of town once I received the actual location after booking. All-in-all it was a great place to stay while in Auburn!

One suggestion and I may have missed it is what options are available on the TV and navigation of TV remote, not a big deal as I figured it out but could be an issue for others."

The apartment is located minutes away from the Auburn campus, very walkable, with plenty of restaurants around. It has a digital lock for an easy self-check in.
Interior is very clean, fresh after a remodel. There are all the amenities for a comfortable and easy stay: dish washer, coffe machine with the k-cups, washer and dryer, TVs with cable/netflix/disney, and more. The outdoor shared pool was warm and deep enough to dive. Two bedrooms with a queen beed, 2 twin beds, and a huge couch that can sleep at least 2 more people.

Stayed with kids","We enjoyed our stay at Danielle’s so much that we ended up staying an additional night. We were in town for our fur baby’s surgery at Bailey Small Animal Hospital. It was just a short ten minute drive to the hospital. For those not wanting to stay right in town, this is the perfect location! The beautiful property is located in a nice, safe area of Auburn. Danielle offers all the amenities that other reviewers have mentioned. It is a very nice and spacious, super clean guest house….with high quality bed and bedding. Danielle goes above and beyond to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. She has delicious local treats waiting for you upon your arrival and knows all the great spots to visit or eat. Danielle is an excellent host that goes the extra mile for her guests!"

Stayed a few nights","Short review: it has a frickin' air hockey table, what else you could want?
This place was perfect for my work stay. I'm an AU grad but the city has outgrown me, so when in the area I prefer to find something secluded. This place fits the bill - quiet and private, but only 10 - 15 minute drive to town. Wifi signal was solid for getting work done or streaming music and video.
The little touches and details are fantastic - I especially appreciated the water filter pitcher in the refrigerator.
Danielle is an excellent host with great communication - couldn't ask for better. Bookmarked this place and it will be the first I check when I need to stay in the area."

Stayed with a pet","First off, I will start with the positive. The location is close to auburn and in a safe trailer park. Also, the front porch was really nice to enjoy the great weather.
Unfortunately, there was a lot of issues with our stay. We had requested an earlier check in, which unfortunately couldn't be met. Not a big deal. When 3pm did arrive (normal check in time), the place was still not ready and the cleaner was still there due to issues with previous guest. Barbara did not do a good job of communicating, as she is not local, when it actually would be ready, and we were stuck waiting till 4pm for the cleaner to finish.
When we did get in, the first thing we noticed was the trailer had a strong smell of cat urine. Honestly, the cleaner did the best they could, but it was not idea. There was still cat hair throughout the house. There was also cat litter dumped all over the backyard. Finally, there were exposed nails on the floor that cut my wife's foot.
I would not stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","Barbara’s place in Auburn was decent. It was cleaned well and felt cozy. She did provide all the essentials you would need. However, there were a few issues.
-my main and biggest issue is that it is advertised with a community pool and tennis courts for use. This is not accurate, as there were no tennis courts and the pool was inaccessible. We actually chose to stay at this location based off of those amenities, despite the fact that our intended destination was still 40 minutes away. Thus, we ended up spending more money for activities since these were not available as listed.
-additionally, the home is definitely cozy and livable, but could use some maintenance. The washer and dryer were wonderful to have, but the dryer did not turn off when the door opened. Seems like a safety hazard. Wifi was spotty but okay. The bathroom floor is sunken in and the hot water nozzle was broken, leaving the hot water dripping throughout our stay.
We really enjoyed the peaceful scenery though."

From Carol’s excellent communication regarding our stay to the house being stocked with every amenity we could ever need, the experience was truly amazing. It was also a fun surprise to find a goody bag filled with snacks and necessities as well as cold drinks waiting for us in the refrigerator. They really thought of everything!!!!

They are incredible hosts, and we can't wait to stay with them again when we return in July. Thank you, Adam and Ally, for hosting a fantastic property that truly feels like home.

Adam and Ally (and Rick) were super to work with as well. They were very accessible and eager to please.
While we're not as big an Auburn football fan as others the decor of the town home is great for those coming to a game. Lots of Auburn football memorabilia. With the location close to campus most people could easily walk to a game and avoid the parking hassle. It's also close to other athletic venues so visitors not coming on a football weekend could easily attend another event. We attended a gymnastics meet during our stay.
All said it was a great experience and we would heartily recommend this location to others."

The entire place was very clean and as a bonus was well decorated with Auburn décor. The large island was perfect for setting up food and drinks before the game. They had corn hole to play and chairs to sit in the small front lawn area. There is plenty of parking in front as well on side streets and thankfully you will not need to move your car much as you can't find a much better location to reasonably walk to the game/restaurants/bars. If I get the chance to come back I would 100% stay here again.

Stayed a few nights","We held this reservation for almost a year and Ally was responsive from Day 1. It was a great part of visiting Auburn for the first time in a few years. The unit was very clean, instructions were clear and most importantly, it was great for gameday since we could walk to Jordan-Hare and not have to deal with traffic. The walk to the stadium is about 15-20 minutes. It's a nice location that has become a much better area since our time as students.

We would definitely stay here again. There were accommodations for our party of 6.

Don't hesitate to stay here!

Thanks Adam and Ally!"

Ally and Adam really took the extra effort to make sure we were informed and happy with our stay. The only ""negative"" I would state is the train woke us up a couple of times but it was not a real big deal.
I would definitely stay here again when in Auburn!"

Stayed about a week","I wish this exact home could be duplicated in every town we visit!!!
We use Airbnb a lot during our travels and this home is the nicest we've ever discovered. There was not one thing different than the pictures depicted & I cannot emphasize how nice that was.
It was immaculate inside and the exterior grounds were well maintained. The neighborhood was quiet.
I had a couple of questions and Julie responded immediately (no matter the time). She is the epitome of a Super Host!!
Some additional plusses:
KS bed - extremely comfortable
Towels - new, fluffy, white, all sizes
Enormous Master Closet
Master Bath - double vanity, huge shower with good water pressure
We didn't use the second bedroom which has a QS bed.
Kitchen - nice dinnerware, utensils, cutlery, cookware. Refrigerator/Stove/Exhaust Fan over stove, and Garbage Disposal are all great quality.
Laundry - W/D both new & oversized high-efficiency units.
I recommend this Airbnb 1000%!!!!
Thanks for such an enjoyable stay, Julie!!!"

Julie was very friendly, responsive and also thoughtful. Check-in & check-out instructions were clear and easy. I even got some ideas for decorating my own house! Everything was exactly as pictured and the experience was even better. Julie’s place will forever be our first choice whenever we are in that area. I wish I could give more than 5 stars!

Her house was beautiful, even more so than the pictures. We were greeted with a basket of snacks on the kitchen island and bottled water in the refrigerator. I thought that was such a nice, welcoming touch.
She went above and beyond any other host I’ve ever encountered. It was our first time in Auburn so we didn’t really know our way around. When we asked for suggestions, she was quick with responses.

Julie is the epitome of what a host should be. There were flowers, bottled water, and snacks waiting for me, clean towels and sheets that smelled WONDERFUL, and the toilet paper even had tissue in the shape of a flower in the middle! Every single corner of the house was tailored for guests … it made me feel like it was meant just for me.
The wifi password, instructions on how to check out, utensils, cookware, shampoo/conditioner/body wash, extra blankets … everything was so easy to find and accessible.
The area was super nice and so quiet … and incredibly close to Auburn’s campus and Tiger Town! I told people in town where I was staying and they immediately boasted how nice the area was!
Already planning on calling this Airbnb home every time I’m in Auburn!"

It was a perfect get away for my family especially due to all the different areas you can hang out in. Several outdoor with even a screened in porch, safe from the bugs, with wind chimes (sigh). I miss it already!!
Thank you so much Amy and Curt for hosting us!!!!"

Stayed a few nights","Three girlfriends (young in our minds, not in our bodies!) wanted a place to stay together during a reunion weekend in Auburn. This cute mid-century home was just 5 minutes from where our events would be. Funky and colorful decorating, it just makes you smile to be in the home! It is in a quiet and private setting, but still convenient to anything happening in Auburn. Access was easy. On the day of check-in, Amy provided a code for the lockbox — the code was good for the entire stay. Everything was comfortable, particularly the beds.
Communication with Amy was excellent. She always responded quickly and kindly. I would not hesitate to rent this place again or to rent another place from Amy and Curt. We had a great time!"

Amy was incredibly kind - she even offered to bring me more cooking dishes (and told me where the good knife set was) when she realized I would be cooking Thanksgiving dinner at the house. I would definitely recommend!

We loved the layout of the house…there are 2 great living spaces, both with TV’s. We watched football, played games, cooked out on the grill. The kitchen had everything we needed & Curt & Amy even offered us breakfast casseroles in the freezer. Convenient to Kroger & several quick restaurants. Easy to get to Toomers & downtown. Definitely a great find"

Group trip","This is a beautiful home and in a walkable neighborhood. I had my fur babies with me and I walked them a few times a day and felt safe walking at night. The community also has dog stations. This townhome sits in a neighborhood along with the apartment at the end of the street and some single homes located on the other side of the townhouses. Some more new single homes were under construction during my stay but I did not hear any noise. The house equipped with all the stuffs that one needs. The townhouse is 15 minutes away from Auburn University and 6-11 minutes from Publix, Kroger, and KPot restaurant.
Jamie was very responsive in her communication and also was very flexible on the check-in time which I did not use but it was nice to have a bit more flexibility for the check-in process.
I would stay again if I make it to Auburn.
Thank you Jamie and Nick for the lovely stay."

Bedrooms good size and each with own bath. Neighbors were close but we never heard a sound. Nice to have garage access for the cars. Clicker was in the house. Good wifi, easy to connect. We brought our roku stick, but could have easily logged into their smart tv's to access our subscriptions in each bedroom and the living room. Plenty of towels in the bathrooms with other supplies. A couple small notes - electric stovetop was pretty slow to heat things and there were no larger pans to cook in - mostly pyrex bowls. Also, main kitchen/living area could use some softer finishes to absorb sound - it's a little echoey. Overall though, this was a great place to stay and we would recommend."

Group trip","I honestly can’t say enough nice things about Julie. I’m such a scatter brain in the month of March. I lost my daughter to the tornadoes there. Julie hosted us while we search for her and her belongings. The house is beautiful and was perfect for our family. We came back for her memorial and rented Julie’s house, and will continue for years to come.
Here is my scatter brain. After leaving, a few days later I couldn’t find my laptop nor the bag it’s usually in. I thought I left it there and in my panic I texted Julie at 11pm. She was awake and called immediately. She knew it wasn’t there because it had already been cleaned but was willing to ask the new renters to look. She was very prompt and it was with me but I couldn’t find it at the time. She is amazing and God has blessed me, with her amazing patients and compassionate heart. Thank you Julie! We will always cherish your kindness!"

We did prepare some food while we were there. However, if we had wanted to cook a Thanksgiving dinner there with all the pots, pans and utensils we could have. I had hoped to make use of the firepit but we were so busy with festivities we didn't have time. If you are in Auburn and need a place for family this is the place to be.

I thoroughly enjoyed sitting on the back porch with coffee in the morning, listening to birds chirp! Because we were traveling with a baby, Julie’s place was a far-better choice than a hotel, and comparably priced (only we had 3 bedrooms and 3 1/2 bathrooms and a kitchen, not just one little hotel room)! Julie even had a pack-and-play already set up and had placed baby toiletries in the bathroom! We will definitely book with Julie whenever we return to Auburn!"

It literally felt like home awake from home. Rick was so very pleasant my whole crew got to meet him. The property was set in such a beautiful place. So peaceful. Very reaponsive to message. We happen to be experiencing some unfavorably weather Rick sent us message immediately and he also called when things turn up a bit more. Such gracious host. My family was in town for our oldest son's graduation , and we changed places last minute due to some personal reasons and it was truly the best decision. If ever we are back for any reason even if overnight I would pray their property was available we would stay again."

The Auburn athletic theme throughout the place is wonderful and brings back so many memories for long time Auburn fans like us. We found it to be well stocked and comfortable. It is well worth the money. Carrie was easy to work with and great at communicating the info needed for a smooth coming and going. Only thing for us was our plans had to change and everyone wasn’t able to come and enjoy staying with Carrie. We will certainly look forward to staying here again. Thanks for all the preparations in making your place feel like home.

We had family over preparing for our fathers funeral the next day and passing out some of his belongings among the children when one of the cars was towed by a ruthless and uncaring tow truck driver. The family was only there a couple hours when that person showed up and hooked up the car, and wouldn't let us have it back until we paid him $125. He said he didn't care what they were there for or how long, he was doing his job. So beware of having visitors."

The only downsides unfortunately were that all of the mattresses were extremely soft mattresses and felt kind of old—save one twin mattress in the bunk bed—each person said they didn’t sleep that well because of that. There was also lighting from the parking lot streaming into some bedrooms at night. All in all if these things were improved we would definitely stay here again because of the hosts and the location.

Stayed a few nights","We were in town for a funeral for a man named Harry and this seemed like fate!
The pros for the place are the location, location, location. If you are in need of food or sundries then you'll never need to get into the car again. During quarantine, we were reluctant to go into a place to eat but we did get takeout from a couple of really good restaurants.
The majority of the unit was also very clean, it's apparent that the living areas have been refloored and the kitchen area was very nicely appointed.
The things our party found difficult - the location. :) The unit is between a large parking garage and the parking lot of this complex therefore with the window blinds as they exist the unit is like day time whether it is noon or midnight. There were also no blinds at all on the windows in the bathrooms and the parking garage, in particular, has a straight view in.
The bedrooms were full with the existing beds and the closet space was minimal or full so there was no real storage for luggage or clothing. It also seemed that the carpet in the bedrooms had not been updated and was very dated/stained.
Finally, this may be apparent to some but I missed it so I mention it here for others. There is no dining area or any kind of table except for the small bar which seats three. There is also no desk area if you need to work while you are staying here. It just made the space difficult for visiting and eating-in (since we weren't going to restaurants)."

Stayed with kids","Harry’s House was a great space! We were in town for a swim meet and the location was perfect for our trip. It was a quick and easy drive to the pool and convenient to everything. There are several quick restaurants right outside the condo and Toomer’s Corner is a short walk away. The space is nicely decorated and had more than enough beds for the amount of people we had. The bedrooms are Jack and Jill style with each bedroom having it’s own private vanity, a plus for us! There was quite a bit of new construction across the street and behind the condo that started up at 6:30am on a Saturday so if you are expecting to sleep in be prepared. There was also a train track close by and the train ran quite frequently during the day. We did not notice it as much in the late night hours. The condo complex is housing for college students and we could hear students conversations out on their balconies at night. If you are a light sleeper there are fans for background noise in each bedroom if needed and the owner communicated that in advance. The owner is very quick to respond to communication and easy to work with. Overall, our experience was great. The condo suited our needs for our trip and we will definitely book it again!"

Location is picture perfect, right within the nucleus of Auburn University and the town center.
sports bars, coffee shops, banks, restaurants, package stores, and drug stores are all within an immediate to extremely short walking distance away. Bring your running shoes too, the jogging paths around here and throughout csmpus are incredible!
Positives
1. Exceptionally kind, communicative, and accommodating hostess in Carrie.
2. Check in process was effortless
3. Parking was a major plus... just please don't forget to display the parking pass in your vehicle...and also to return it to the condo before checking out.
4. THE CONDO - so spacious, cozy, and comfortable. Amenities galore... great wi-fi, fully loaded laundry room, plenty of towels, bedding, free space, and privacy.
There's 2 bathrooms one on each side of the hallway, ajoined to the bedrooms.
There's 4 bedrooms... but this place could easily, comfortably sleep 8 or more. The bunk beds in the kids room even looked large enough for average sized adults!
I was alone on this trip...but I am so glad that I didn't cancel my reservation. I cannot wait to hopefully return next year.

Stayed a few nights","Everything from the moment of initial contact with Carrie to the morning of moving out was flawless.
She wrote us a very sweet Southern Belle
arrival card for us to read welcoming us to town. She also left us two special AU town welcome gifts. The condo is impeccable and it’s decor if filled with cool Auburn memorabilia. The linnens were clean and high quality. She provides amenities such as soap, shampoo detergent and towels. All goods are placed intuitively and easy to find. The kitchen is fully stocked. I cooked three full meals for my college athlete while there.
The rooms are decorate neatly with AU decor. The parking was easy. As stated in previous reviews, the train does run through nearby at night, but it really is no big deal. We would not hesitate to book here again."

Stayed a few nights","Staying at Denise's Airbnb was an absolute delight from start to finish! Right off the bat, the cleanliness of the place was impeccable, making it immediately clear that Denise takes great pride in providing a spotless and welcoming environment for her guests.
The location couldn't have been better. It was conveniently situated, offering easy access to local attractions, dining, and shopping options, yet it was peaceful enough to offer a tranquil retreat after a day of exploration. This balance of convenience and serenity is a rare find and truly enhanced the overall experience of my stay.
Communication with Denise was another highlight. She was exceptionally responsive, providing clear and helpful information from the moment of booking through to check-out. Her willingness to go above and beyond in ensuring a smooth and enjoyable stay was evident in every interaction. Denise's warm and friendly communication style made me feel valued and taken care of throughout my visit.

We had a long leash so we could play ball and very little traffic going by so she wasn’t in danger of the road. Neighbor has 2 dogs that were always out, fenced, barked whenever we when we went out and then stopped when we got out of site in the yard. They were fine if we were just on the back porch. Not a problem just know theyre out there. Very convenient, could walk to some places."

It was a wonderful stay. This location will be added tor list of favorite places and recommendations."
