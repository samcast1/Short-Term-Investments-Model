Stayed a few nights",We booked Rosie‘s retreat because we were coming in for our grandsons high school graduation. It was absolutely gorgeous. Will definitely stay there again when we come back to Tennessee from California. Thank you for a great experience for our first time in Tennessee.

Stayed with kids","Overall good experience, I feel that the check out “to do list” is a little excessive. I’m fairly clean person but I rather pay a higher cleaning fee then have to worry about taking out trash, cleaning the grill, and starting a load of laundry before I leave. Considering I’m probably already rushing with my 2 under 2 and trying to enjoy time away from mommy duties. But other than that host is very communicative, everything is as described, and the beds are comfortable. Only room with a TV is the living room and the sofa bed in the living room is pretty uncomfortable to sit on, so I probably wouldn’t want this to be a place I chose if I plan to be lounging around or wanting to lay in my bedroom and watch TV. Backyard is extremely nice and if you’re an outdoors person like myself the scenery, lights, fire pit, and grill make it worth it for me 😊"

Stayed one night","Wow. That’s the only word that comes to mind.
I stayed with my adult son and his family and the space was so homey, quaint and comfortable.
We immediately felt like kids when we saw the beautiful backyard fire pit with lighting…next to the wedding venue. I wish I would have booked a vacation here instead of a night.
The outdoor kitchen was vintage and made me want to have a gathering with family in the space.
The living room had a record player, lots of games and instruments. Perfect for my family of little musicians!
The kitchen serveware had vintage pieces that my daughter in law couldn’t wait to serve something from.
It was a magical place that could be a stand alone destination. You go there for the space.
Love, love, love.❤️"

Only downside was a lawn care team arrived day before at 7am to prep area and was very loud with leaf blowers and mowers. Hopefully the crew can begin at least after 8am in the future for other travelers.

Stayed a few nights","Rosie's Retreat was everything we hoped for....close to our activities, clean, VERY organized, and so quiet. Every little detail was considered and it is obvious that Rosie's was renovated with guest comfort and ultra convenience in mind. As someone who spends a lot of time in the kitchen I was really impressed with the cabinet labels and the uncluttered, simple, yet well-thought out supplies were so appreciated. The colors in the reno were fun and coordinated and our teen girls loved the extra big mirrors in the back dressing room. Even though we didn't use the outdoor space too much since it was quite hot, I can imagine that at night with the string lights and friends would be magical. The beds were very comfortable for us and the quiet neighborhood certainly added to a good nights sleep."

Stayed with a pet",Clean and beautifully decorated home. Nice quiet neighborhood. Loved the backyard and the kitty named Justin that came to visit. I even saw raccoons walk down the path behind the house. Lots of song birds as well. Julie communicated well and even walked by to say hello. I really liked that we had a driveway to park in. The only suggestion I would make is to install handrails going down the back steps as they are a bit steep. I have a vestibular disorder and I struggled a bit with the back stairs to the patio. If the weather would have been cooler I would have enjoyed the fire pit. But the weather was perfect and I enjoyed just hanging out on the patio. Thank you Julie for the last minute reservation and accommodations. I would definitely stay here again!

It's very quiet and if you're used to sleeping with a fan, you will definitely need to bring one. The back area seemed bigger in pictures and I didn't realize the walkway for historic ann's was so close to the hangout area but it wasn't an issue for us as there were no events during our stay. Our little family loved Rosie's and Justin the kitty is so sweet and lovable. We miss him already!"

Stayed with kids","One of the best experiences with Airbnb I’ve had. Julie was SO flexible (I’m talking letting us switch to a different one of her properties after I realized the first one wouldn’t be ideal for our sleeping situation). Rosie’s Retreat was the type of house I wished I lived in. Chic and comfortable in every way. Communication was amazing. The vibe felt comfortable and relaxed. And the location was exactly where we wanted to be. She even threw in tickets to the discovery park of America. Overall, we couldn’t have dreamed of a better experience. If anyone opts to stay anywhere else in the area, they are just missing out. We cannot wait to be back!"

Stayed with kids","Julie was fantastic! Very helpful, and has the cutest home! She has the most adorable accommodations as well!
The neighbors were our absolute only issue. Around 5am, I woke up to screaming and fighting between a man and a woman. I mean VIOLENTLY screaming so much, with a ton of curse words. It stopped for about 15 mins, then started again. This went on for almost an hour. We had one of our 11 yrs olds with us, so it was honestly awful to listen to.
With that being said, I hate that the neighbors created an issue, because this home was perfect otherwise!"

Stayed with a pet","The location and amenities were exactly as described. It is a very nice, well kept home and it had more ""extras"" then I have had in the past. Checking in and out was easy, I had a few questions and Julie responded quickly. There is a large area next to home where my animals could run around. The neighbors behind that lot were very nice. The neighbors to the immediate right of the house were questionable with their rotating door all weekend however they kept to themselves and their guests did also. I never felt unsafe here. The beds were comfortable and there were plenty of pillows, blankets. There was even mood lighting in the living room and electric fireplaces. Very nice, thank you."

Stayed one night","All the sleeping accommodations were comfortable, and it was very nice having access to a pack n play and high chair. The house is definitely not baby proof though - we had to move a lot of pottery and trinkets so our toddlers wouldn’t get them. The checkout tasks are pretty extensive for the price you pay, plus already paying a cleaning fee."

Stayed with a pet","This home felt much larger when I first entered it than the photo's. So if you are traveling with more than 2 people there is plenty of space for privacy and not feeling cramped.
The main reason I booked this home was that it was Dog Friendly and Affordable! I have a 13 yr old lil lady who I didn't want to leave behind. She enjoyed the big yard and quiet neighborhood.
The location is in a historic part of town that was quiet for the most part. There is a house right next to this one noise carried, but nothing major.
If you are looking for a comfortable place to stay that is centrally located to so many places, then this is for you. Be sure to visit Reelfoot Lake and just drive around the country roads. Food for your soul!
It has all the comforts of home. The Main bed was very comfortable which I was pleasantly surprised! : )
If possible I'd suggest bringing your own pillows though. I drove so I had the options of packing more than if you are flying.
I'd def rebook again."

The Owner is very quick to respond to questions if needed. Fully stocked kitchen. Washer and dryer was very handy as well.

Stayed with kids","Julie's place was one of our favorite stays ever! We love hiking and National Parks, so we were completely delighted with the home's theme (wall art of her and David's travels to National Parks). Additionally, the handmade wood furniture and locally crafted pottery made GOE a special place that we want to visit again.
Parents of littles will want to know:
-Julie put nightlights in every room!
-Yes, there are many breakable things, but also a great closet where you can stash them (with sliding door that my toddler couldn't open). We put their guitar away the moment we got there, but if you're a musical family, you'll love having the instruments!
-house has washer/dryer AND detergent; bathrooms have shampoo/conditioner/body wash
-bathrooms have great medicine cabinets if you need to keep things out of reach of kids (or just like a clear vanity space on vacation!)
-bring your own plastic plates/sippy cups if you need those
-As a family of 4, we didn't need the extra room that is optional
-You are within walking distance of one Union City Kiwanis park and a 5-minute drive from Graham park (where our boys got out all sorts of energy!). We LOVED hiking at Reelfoot Lake and exploring and seeing eagles at the National Wildlife Refuge there (30-minutes away) and our boys (7 and 3) loved Discovery Park of America (5 minutes away). Our Pink Palace membership in Memphis got us into Discovery Park for free (so ask if you have memberships in other cities that might have reciprocity).
-Plenty of convenient take-out in the town.
We packed a lot into a 4-day trip. I think we'll stay longer next time!"

The property isn’t too much and isn’t too little it was perfect. My husband enjoyed playing on their guitar and I enjoyed the view from the porch. I really enjoyed our stay only thing I can say went wrong and it more than likely was an operator error is we weren’t able to leave our photo and add to their collection. Lol maybe I will mail them one! I would definitely recommend a stay here and it’s a very reasonable cost

Stayed a few nights","If you enjoy small towns and have memories of visiting grandparents or growing up in white framed houses with wood floors and neighbors close by, you'll step into a relaxing and simpler time when you enter Gloria's on Exchange. But unlike Grandma's house, everything is functional and modernized and very comfortable as well. We enjoyed time with extended family here, restful beds, playing ""42"" (a Texas domino game) around the kitchen table, and listening to the heavy rain fall outside the windows our first night. The kitchen was very functional, bathrooms were conveniently located in each bedroom, and the central heat/air made everything very pleasant. If we're ever in Union City again, I hope GOE will be available to transport us once again to a relaxing escape from our hectic and stressful lives. I'm sure it will do the same for you!"

Stayed with kids",We loved our stay at Gloria’s on Exchange! Julie and David are great hosts. The home was very clean and stocked with what we needed. The twin beds in the second bedroom are wonderful for families traveling with young kids. Check in and check out was a breeze. We loved the tablet and Google Home connectivity. Julie and David have also provided some instruments for guests to enjoy- that was a special treat! We will definitely stay there next time we’re in Union City.

There were a few items that we have come to expect at airbnbs that either were missing or we were unable to find: shampoo (there was conditioner), body soap for the shower, a can opener, and a colander. Otherwise, the kitchen had what we needed to cook a meal.
Communicative, friendly host."

Stayed with kids","We are originally from Martin and had to come to town unexpectedly and needed a place to stay. Many others were very expensive and as a disabled veteran on a fixed income, the house was amazing and very very nice. We haven’t used or stayed at many BNB but of the ones we have this one was the absolute best of them all. So nice and clean and had everything we needed to make our stay exceptional. The communication was lightning fast and so helpful. If you are looking for a place to stay last minute or somewhere for days on end, this is the place for you. If we end up going back home any other time and need a place to stay we will definitely look here first. So much better than a hotel and much cheaper than many other places. Made our last minute emergency trip home so much better. Thank you for everything!"

Stayed a few nights","The Maplemere is a cute and cozy home perfectly nestled in a quiet neighborhood of Martin. Perfectly sized home with farmhouse vibes (beautiful butcher block counter tops in the kitchen), 3 bedrooms, 1.5 bath, and a large dining room area. I felt as if I had plenty of space to both work and relax while I was there. The added amenities of providing lots of coffee, toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, soap, etc.), and laundry detergent was a nice touch! What stood out was the host, she is just above and beyond wonderful as well. Not only were her instructions clear and thorough, but she even checked in with me when we arrived just to make sure everything was as it should be and to make sure we didn’t have questions or need anything."

Stayed with kids","The stay at Tori’s was exceptional. This place is a great place to choose, if you are visiting or bringing your college student to the campus of University of Tennessee at Martin, just stay here. Smells fresh, has plenty of space, plenty of room, great cold AC and all the amenities are in the kitchen that you will need to prepare meals. Large enough space for a big family, with gathering areas, cozy corners, comfy blankets, and throws, the beds were amazing, soft and fluffy. We slept really well. The house is easy to get to, on the corner in a very quiet and private neighborhood. It was such a great stay. Shopping near by, restaurants and fast food close too. We enjoyed The Grande restaurant, and Tori’s suggestion for local places were such a helpful addition to our plans. We also visited the museum in Union City, The Discovery Park of America which was only about 15 minutes away. So if you are ever in the area, this is the home to pick."

The condo was extremely comfortable for our two families. We were especially grateful for two bathrooms, and a very well equipped kitchen. The washer, dryer, and all the miscellaneous supplies are also a huge bonus. Although we did not have much time, we could’ve certainly hosted a meal right at our place.

I highly recommend a stay at Annabelle’s!

Stayed with a pet","Annabelle's to set the bar high for my first Airbnb experience. I've stayed in Airbnb rentals as part of family trips but have yet to secure one myself. We usually stay at a local hotel when visiting family in the area. However, I was preparing a celebratory dinner and needed a kitchen for this visit. I was impressed by how responsive and kind Mary communicated with me. This home is easy to find and is located in a lovely part of Union City. A grocery store, Walgreens, a pizza joint, and a Mexican restaurant are within a brief walk. The home is well-appointed and tastefully furnished. The king bed in the ensuite was comfortable. The house was spotlessly clean!!! We had an elderly dog and a six-month-old pup with us. The fenced backyard was a huge plus. The kitchen was well equipped with newer pots and pans of all sizes. I was able to prepare my special meal with no difficulties. We most definitely recommend this rental, and we plan to return in the future."

Stayed a few nights","I had to make some last minute arrangements to meet family in Union City for my Aunts birthday celebration & found Annabelle’s, as soon as I saw it online, I knew it was the perfect place & my family would be at home. Annabelle’s was perfect in every way, and yes it was truly a blessing! It’s clean, comfortable, close to everything, it’s just like home. My brother & sister were arriving a day before me & they were running late, so Mary turned the light on so that the would not have to arrive in the dark. They were so very thankful for that kind gesture & that’s the very kind of thing that makes Annabelle’s a special place. If I ever have the need to stay in Union City, I will check Annabelle’s first. If you’ve never stayed at an Airbnb, and you’re hesitant, don’t be. You’ll never regret staying there!! Thank you for making our stay extra special♥️"

We always come to UT Martin in February for a big gokart race, but always stay in a hotel (usually in Union City because of more availability and better pricing). I booked the Cottage because it was actually cheaper than booking a hotel room this year, and we’d have two bathrooms. This place was PERFECT! It was so close to the arena, which meant we could sleep later than normal. Great hot water (a big thing for us!), super clean, and SO quiet! If we race in Martin again, we will definitely book again! 10/10 recommend!"

Stayed about a week","The stay with Brandy started out well but there were complications and miscommunication that resulted in a other than enjoyable experience. Overall as a host Brandy is a great host but the way the Airbnb and complications were handled by her resulted in a disconnect and caused the handyman to be out of the loop and caused issues. Therefore, the main handling of things by both hosts wasn’t as well as expected. It would have been preferred to have better communication entirely and to be able to feel that our needs were being met regarding that. The stay overall was okay. It would have just been better if there was more communication."

I especially enjoyed swinging on the side porch where I watched the sunset in the evening and sunrise the next morning. I felt safe in the residential area that was convenient to whatever was needed. I recommend Lisa’s place. 😁

Two points to the potential guest - there is no door on the bedroom, and the door to the bathroom (sliding) doesn't totally cover the opening. My kids would yell, ""I'm going to the bathroom, no one go to the hallway"" to make sure they had privacy."

Which sliding barn door is cute but does not shut entirely and you have a perfect view from the potty to the area between the kitchen and living room.
The master bed was extremely comfortable, and the pillows were perfect.

We are a party of six including my one year old and my three other kids. Lisa’s home is really cozy, and all of us slept like a baby. I’m very happy we found Lisa’s place because there was no way I could’ve done the 19 hour drive from Imlay City,MI to our home in Dallas TX with 4 kids. The home is located walking distance to a gas station with really good Bar B Que 😋 Overall, we enjoyed Lisa’s place. Thank you Lisa!"

Its a shame because it is such a cute adorable house, but I could never stay there again due to the unhealthy environment. Im not sure if these types of rentals are inspected but they sure need to be before they are allowed to be rented."

This was all attributed to Google maps and darkness, and not at all the responsible of the host. Once we did reach our destination check in was easy, and the cleanliness and size surprised us. It is conveniently located in Union City which provided restaurants and grocery. We drove in from Michigan to see the total eclipse in Northern Kentucky, so our interaction with the apartment was limited, but it certainly exceeded our expectations! Thank you Marlena!"

It just requires more responsive, conscientious care and hosting. I’m disappointed as I had hoped to make it my regular rental during visits to the area."

Group trip","We took the entire family back to where they grew up for their Grandmothers Birthday. I will never stay anywhere else when we go back there. It was just like we were home. We were so comfortable there. I’ve never stayed in a place with so many little “extra” thoughts lying around. So many special little added touches from new toothbrushes, toothpaste, shampoo and body wash to even makeup remover cloths. Such thoughtful little extras! The house was so big and roomy and enough areas that everyone could spread out and get some peace to themselves!
The master bed was so comfy. The decor is just perfect for the Cottage House.
The Master bath along with the adorable back patio was what drew me to that rental and although it was cold and we didn’t get to take advantage of the patio, the big soaking Jacuzzi tub made up for the cold weather.
Communication with Katie was so easy and she made sure we had everything we needed during our stay!"

Stayed a few nights","Staying at Katie's house made the trip to visit the soon to be new in-laws stress-free. We loved how cute the house was, how clean it was, it smelled absolutely incredible, and was extremely comfortable. I loved the little courtyard that she has on the side of the house attached to the very neat lawn. Katie's communication made this trip so easy, and she was very quick to help accommodate any question or need. When we travel, we like privacy and comfort, and we received exactly that. We really enjoyed the homieness of the kitchen and the whirlpool tub. Her house has so much character and charm. The only thing that we had to keep an eye on was the thermostat resets to her schedule about every 2 hours and we visited on the most humid and hot weekend I have ever experienced, so we were avidly checking that. We stayed cool the entire time, Katie helped us figure out the pattern, so don't panic, all systems work perfectly. Katie was an excellent host and we will absolutely be back."
