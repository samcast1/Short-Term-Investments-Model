Stayed with kids","The house has a LOT of history and it was all very interesting. You can tell the house is a spot of pride and care. It fitted our needs very well.
The hosts are super friendly, very proactive and helpful. They also like to chat. If a guest is socially awkward, they may not appreciate the interactions and phone calls as much, but it's easy to tell that everything is done with good intentions.
There is a shower head on the tub, which enabled us, and our teenager, to shower regularly and my husband really appreciated the spacious tub.
While the listing can be off-putting to those with small children, the stairs are not as treacherous as other places I've stayed and the railing is blessedly sturdy.
The twin-bed room and the king-size bedroom are only separated by a closet. Not the most private of locations, but we were too busy for any of that anyway. ;)"

Stayed a few nights",Wonderful. You can tell that Bev and Alan take pride in their lovely property. It shows how much work and love they have put into restoring this wonderful and historical home. There were fresh roses throughout the house when we arrived which was such a nice touch. Staying at Bev and Alan’s It made our visit to The Dalles super special. We can’t wait to come back.

Stayed a few nights","I’m happy to write yet another 5 star review for Alan and Bev! Their property is almost as much of a gem as they are! This property was clearly a labor of love and they clearly enjoy sharing it with their guests, providing so many personal and welcoming touches. The house was comfortable and well-equipped. Communication was above and beyond. They accommodated our weird weekend baseball schedule as though we were family. If we find ourselves in The Dalles in the future, Alan and Bev will be our first call!"

Stayed a few nights","Our hosts were very welcoming and friendly and even though we arrived quite late, they were there to show us around and explain everything to us and to point out interesting points about the house and the area. They have restored a beautiful Victorian house with much love and hard work to provide a little gem. Every room is thoughtfully decorated and the high ceilings make it feel very spacious. Their attention to detail is second to none, from the original hardware on the doors to the recommendations of places to visit and eat and the fresh roses in every sparkling clean room. We had everything we needed for a relaxing stay in a very interesting and beautiful house."

Stayed with kids",We enormously enjoyed our stay at Allen and Bev's home. Their love of the home is evident in talking to them and in every detail of the house that they have painstakingly restored. It was so cool hearing the stories and seeing the book about the homes history and renovations. The interior designs and furnishings go perfectly and make the home feel warm and not just like a museum. Allen and Bev were super friendly and helpful. The wooden butler sculpture with our names in the front was a great touch. We can't wait to visit again as there is so much to explore in the area. We highly recommend it.

We also like the location close to everything in down town The Dalles. Bev and Allen are very easy to work with, as far as communication on the stay. They are also very nice to talk to, nice people. We love visiting The Dalles and staying at the house that Bev and Allen have made so very nice."

My kids loved being able to play in the yard and the ability to walk to a playground, farmers market, ice cream, a city pool and multiple restaurants. We were there during a heat wave and the AC worked very well thankfully!
We will definitely stay here again our next visit. Thanks again Al and Bev!"

Stayed a few nights","Where to even begin? The cleanliness and comfort and gorgeously-done restoration of this amazing home combined with the most gracious and welcoming hosts make this a best-ever Air BnB experience. The location couldn't be better with all of downtown The Dalles at your doorstep, and the house was perfect to come home to in the evenings for games, conversation, and relaxation. It really felt like a little step back in time for us history buffs.
Also, every little detail has been thought of, from the coffee on hand (the hosts brought us a full, fresh half and half for our fridge, so we could relax in the morning after arrival) to all the other little amenities that made this a truly comfy and convenient experience. Also...those little beds in the second bedroom? Don't let them fool you - the matress and luxurious bedding made for a plenty adult-friendly few nights of snoozing and coziness.
In short, can't wait to go back. We've always stayed at The Dalles Inn when we've visited town, but now that we know about this gem, we'll be back! Thanks Bev and Alan!"

Stayed a few nights","The Trevitt House is absolutely awesome! It is beautiful, both inside and out, and it is clear that Alan and Bev put their heart and soul into this project. They were really friendly and easy to communicate with, both before and during my stay. They met me upon arrival to check me in and chat about the house for a bit. The home is also very comfortable (comfy furniture and beds, the A/C worked well in hot weather, the TV was easy to use, and there is plenty of room to roam around). The only thing worth mentioning, that I didn't see in the listing or in any reviews, is the noise from the nearby train (it runs and sounds a horn all night long), as well as the street traffic (which was quiet from about 12-6am, but pretty loud the rest of the time). This is obviously out of the host's control and they did provide earplugs (though they didn't help at all), but it's something to take note of if you are not a sound sleeper."

Stayed a few nights","This house has been our favorite place we’ve stayed at that we’ve found on Airbnb. We got the whole house to ourselves, and the history of the house and it’s restoration were so fun to read up on.
The hosts are also great, and live in another historic house next door. They went out of their way to provide lots of small extras that really contributed to the atmosphere and stay. There were fresh cut flowers all through the house, coffee supplies (including biscotti’s) and a very comfortable bed. My husband commented that he couldn’t remember the last time he’d slept so well.
The area offers some nice restaurants, and a cute downtown to stroll though. Overall, we had a fantastic time at this house."

Stayed a few nights","I have used Airbnbs for years and this is by far the best ever Airbnb. If you have your Oregon trip planned out and you don’t have a night booked at Alan and Bev’s, you need to change it. My two girl friends and I stayed and it was the perfect fit for our girls’ trip, but it would really be great for any group of people. It was extremely clean and welcoming. It was so close to local attractions in The Dalles, as well as a convient distance from modern necessities like grocery stores.
Aside from the place, Alan and Bev were such welcoming, helpful, and genuinely kind people. They stayed up late for our very late arrival, they provided us with a binder of local attractions and restaurants with how far of a walk from the house they were, they even gave us tips on which trails in Mt. Hood National Forest were worth it and directions to them. My friends and I would stay at their place again simply to see them another time."

There is so much space to spread out and organize. We deeply appreciated some morning treats and yummy Seattle coffee selections! The fact that this home was literally saved from destruction and rebuilt to continue to house The Dalles travelers is a bonus!

The front porch and rocking chair were our favorite features. Alan was great about communicating with us about check-in and very helpful suggesting things for us to do around the area.

Stayed a few nights","We stayed in this historic house on our honeymoon and loved it. It has a gas fireplace, tv, Netflix, and wifi. The bedroom upstairs can be divided into two separate (still big) bedrooms by two large wooden doors. The main bathroom does not have a shower, instead it has a clawfoot bathtub and hand sprayer (that works surprisingly well). The kitchen has a fridge and microwave but does not have a stove/oven. The house is surrounded by flowers, and the lovely owners, Bev & Alan, live right next door. The location is really convenient for walking. We spent one day and drove to Maryhill Winery, Maryhill Museum, and Horsethief Lake to see the pictographs and petroglyphs. The views were absolutely astounding. We would definitely like to stay here again."

Stayed with kids","Words can not fully describe our love for Bev and Alan’s home. We booked for a weekend to celebrate my hubby’s birthday and it was the absolute best decision. We arrived and Bev and Alan greeted us with a safely distanced hello and chat. We walked in and our mouths hit the floor. This home is even in more beautiful in person. The first night we ordered Thai food from up the street, sipped on wine and streamed Netflix for a family movie night, while being kept cozy from the fireplace. The beds are comfy, fans in each room (we can’t sleep without them) and ample space for our family. The next day we biked 12 miles along the water (stunning views) and on the way back stopped for a beverage at the Barge Pub (awesome views and spot to sit outside on adirondack chairs ). Later that night we walked into town for dinner to grab some vegan pizza from Freebridge Brewing (outside seating and totally Covid safe) - it was delicious! We haven’t really hung out in the Dalles before, but now that we have, not sure what we were waiting for?! Look out Hood River - you have some competition! Book the Trevitt house now - you will be glad you did :)"

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at the Historic Trevitt House did not disappoint! It was even more pleasant than the pictures, and filled with so many additional gems. Alan and Bev were amazing hosts, made us feel at home, and had so many helpful resources available for us. The house was extremely clean, and had everything we needed for a relaxing and wonderful weekend...including decaf coffee (I can only drink decaf, so that was a treat to have available). The fresh cut flowers throughout the house added a special touch. After a day of hiking (8 miles) along Historic Hwy 30, we enjoyed dinner and a show at the Granada Theater, and live music at Route 30, all within walking distance of the house. We also found some great finds at the oldest bookstore in Oregon - Klindt's - before heading home. I can't say enough about how wonderful this place is! If you're looking for a relaxing place to get away - definitely check this place out!"

Stayed a few nights","WOW. We picked this place for a special trip, and boy were we glad.
Alan and Bev have made a memorable, refined but unstuffy tea parlor, as cozy and comfy as it is elegant and full of thoughtful details.
Whether you're dreaming of a cozy, guest house to luxuriate and relax in, or do a weekend Oregon history dive in proper style (The Dalles is where your history is at!), the Trevitt Guest House will do superbly. We did both! The house has a long and storied history and was an experience unto itself- we spent the winter days on downtown walks and evenings reading or watching movies fireside.
The hosts are pros! Alan and Bev were so friendly and left us delicious treats and helpful local tips. They provided info or help on anything we could need and made us feel quite welcome.
We had been hesitant about the lack of a shower but found it to be unmissed. The hot water is plentiful and hot, with soft, spa-like towels! Despite the house being about 150 years old, the whole house is remarkably warm and cozy. The view of downtown and the river made our bedroom restful.
We loved it, learned a lot, and we are looking forward to our return. Treat yourself and your loved one(s), go to Trevitt!"

Even without an oven/stovetop, it was super helpful to have a good size fridge, sink, and microwave for snacks, easy breakfast, and drinks. We enjoyed the claw foot tub, gracious living room, and really comfortable beds. Adding a shout out for the Vietnamese restaurant within a few blocks from the house, as all 3 of our different dishes were delicious!"

We received a warm welcome, a wonderful tour and they were available to answer questions and provide recommendations. We had an incredible time - staying here was like being transported to another place and time. Being here brought us joy and I hope we have the opportunity to go back to The Dalles to spend some more time in this fabulous house!!!"

Stayed a few nights","There is just one word to The Trevitt house: MAGICAL! My parents, partner and I had a wonderful time in the house. The house has magical touches... we felt we were in an old house that you can normally just take pictures of. Alan and Bev are wonderful hosts, very responsive. We decided to walk bare foot (like we do it at home since we don't like to walk with shoes inside) when we saw that the house was sparkling clean. It would be a huge missed opportunity if you decide not to stay in this house if you can."

Alan and Bev live next door and are really friendly and have lots of local knowledge. They gave us our space during our stay, but had some great recommendations for us and were really nice to talk to when we would see them out in the yard or on their porch. They were also really generous and easy going with our check in and out times.
We would stay again for sure, great house and great hosts!"

Stayed a few nights","Alan & Bev’s Trevitt Guesthouse was such a wonderful experience. As three travel friends, we picked this location because we had some watercraft & wanted to do some exploring outdoors. Not only did The Dalles offer some amazing options like a drive-in movie showing at Sunshine Mill brewery but we were 30 minutes from Hood River for hiking and an hour from putting our canoes out on the incredible Timothy Lake.
Every night we had such a comfortable home to come to, WiFi and TV worked great, comfortable climate conditions, and all the games they had to offer really added a special touch. Limited kitchen was no problem, we brought a slow cooker and there’s plenty of room for food storage. The luxurious bath soaks were great and the beds were so comfy!
Lastly Alan & Bev were so accommodating and knowledgeable about the surrounding areas, their warmth really enhanced the whole experience! Can’t wait to come back!"

These two know how to host! From the excellent communication to the fun suggestions of places to eat, we were well taken care of but the final touch were the beautiful vases of roses from their garden that scented every room and added such beauty.
Thank you!"

The interior has been lovingly restored and you can feel their joy and also pride. We were greeted to fresh flowers (daffodils & violets) and an impeccably clean house. They live next door and gave us a quick tour when we arrived, and throughout their communication was always fast and responsive and never overbearing. Can't recommend this place highly enough."

They have a great eye for preserving the charm and the history of the house, while updating the functionality - modern heating/AC, wifi, lots of outlets, plenty of hot water, etc. Our hosts, who live next door, were very gracious and helpful, and know a lot about the area (ask them about the old Catholic Church nearby). The house is an easy walk to the historic downtown area, with plenty of restaurants and brew pubs to choose from. We highly recommend this house and it's wonderful hosts!!"

We stopped at the grocery store on the way into town and did not need to drive again until we checked out. Thank you for a lovely get away!"

It gave me a great sence of welcoming as well as peace of mind knowing we were truly experiencing something very special. LOVED every aspect of this guest house, the one thing I would mention that may be a negative (for someone who cannot do stairs) this may not be the place for you. However with that being said, I Loved it as the staircase for me was just representative of how these homes were built back in the 1800's with such character and style...."

Stayed over a week","The location is about in the middle of The Dalles, there was a small grocery about a half-block away and the Safeway was about a half-mile away. It was a very quiet and peaceful neighborhood. It had a small kitchen with a full sized refrigerator but there are plenty of restaurants and fast-food places within about a mile if you don't want to cook.
I was impressed with the linens, I think I might get a set, and very nice ""Charisma Towels"".
I stayed a month, it was a very pleasant stay, and everything I needed was provided.
Patti answered all my questions quickly and I would definitely stay there again if I am ever in The Dalles, Oregon."

We have been traveling with Airbnb for years now and this is one of the best ones we've stayed in. It's comfortable, clean and it has everything you may need for a short or long stay. It was two of us and the space felt just right. The bed is super comfortable and the towels and linens are noticeable clean. The kitchen is small but the space is enough to move around comfortably. We cooked most meals ourselves. The location is great, close to center of town and there's a French bakery close by with yummy croissants. Patti was great as a host. Communication was fast and easy, we loved meeting her and got to have a couple of chats. Thank you Patti for a lovely stay, we can't wait to come back to your oasis!"

Patti is a very considerate host who goes out of her way to help you and is a great person to connect with. The apartment is above the garage and is separated from the main house, which results in a quiet private space. I don't think there is a better location in the town, situated in a pleasant neighborhood to walk around but also very close to downtown; everything in town is within a 7 minute drive."

Full kitchen w/Keurig, stove, refrigerator, toaster, microwave, pots, pans, dishes and cooking and eating implements.
Necessities in bathroom. Even a toothbrush I didn’t need.
Really quick replies to texts and even let me check-in early.

Stayed one night",We had a wonderful stay in Patti's lovely apartment in The Dalles. She was very communicative and her directions and check in instructions were easy to follow. The space was large and clean and Patti was kind enough to leave plenty of bottled water in the fridge. It was the perfect place to relax and unwind (and eat the complimentary popcorn while watching Netflix on the Roku tv!) after a week roadtripping through the cascades.

Stayed one night",My husband and I usually go to Hood River a lot for biking shopping etc. We weren’t seeing much availability in hood river for this weekend so we looked in the Dalles and found Patty’s place. What a great find! We still had our fun in Hood River but headed up to the Dalles for the evening. The apartment was so nice and spacious with its own little kitchen and fridge. We were very separate from the main house so we have lots of privacy. We also took a walk/hike from the apartment up to Sorosis Park Which was a great little exercise walk with great views of the gorge.For dinner that night we would recommend the highway house. They had a great menu for a good price. I would definitely come back here again!

Hot-showered off the previous days' dust etc., before heading out to get dirty & sweaty again! Made breakfast, coffee & sandwiches in the kitchen. Nice that the space is temp controlled (Air Conditioned) via the mini-split upgrade. Very pleased...5+ stars from these two travelers!"

The creek below was not for my old legs but I could imagine exploring 30-40 years ago.
The bed was very comfortable and I loved the white noise from her a/c. I ate out with friends so I didn't use the kitchen to prepare a meal but I saw that it would be easy to do.
My friends are new in town and I have recommended Debi's hideaway for their visiting family when they come. Thank you."

The downstairs apartment where we stayed was beautifully decorated and fully stocked with everything from kitchen needs for cooking to games in the closet for family play. The bed was very comfortable. The yard is gorgeous and the girlfriend couldn't get enough of the horses. The living area is incredibly spacious. Yes, you will probably hear footsteps upstairs, but it's no different than most hotels or apartments. It didn't annoy us and it was completely quiet after 10 p.m. The place is just out of town so that it's quiet, but so close that nothing is really more than 10 minutes away by car. Walmart is in Hood River if you need it, probably 20 to 25 minutes away. Laundromat 5 minutes from the apartment. Everything was convenient, the apartment was welcoming, and Debi was a kind, considerate, wonderful host. Will definitely stay again if we can get back to The Dalles."

We were impressed (once again) with the space as well as the careful attention to detail, down to providing goodies for breakfast in the fridge which we did appreciate. Our host also provided information about the local area with brochures, etc which we found useful. Parking was convenient and off the street and just about at our door. In short I'd say this has to be one of our top AirBnB experiences and I'd highly recommend a stay in Dalles at Mill Creek Get-Away."

Stayed one night","Located on the west edge of The Dalles, overlooking a bit of acreage. Very quiet.
Bnb portion is downstairs, with private entrance. So no stairs to contend with, stays cool, not brightly lit. Interesting, horse-themed décor. Everything very clean. Bed very comfortable, ditto the futon/bed.
We did not meet our hosts until we were in the process of loading up to leave, but had a nice visit with them at that point.
It wasn’t until we were many miles down the road that I realized I’d left my hearing aids on the bedroom dresser. I immediately phoned Debi, who was on her way to Portland, but promised to look for them that evening. They found not only my hearing aids, but my down jacket, two homemade travel pillows, and a couple of magazines I hadn’t finished reading. (These had evidently slipped onto the floor on the far side of the bed.) They immediately shipped everything back to me, and it was all back in my hands within 48 hours! (I of course reimbursed them for the shipping expense.) I can’t say enough good about them going above and beyond!"

We loved plating darts, ambling down to the creek, stroking the cats, admiring the garden, the horses and even caught a glimpse of one of the bald eagles that hang out in the fir trees opposite. No time to shoot hoops with my son unfortunately!
Compared to the other places we looked at in The Dalles area this was unbeatable value. Having all we needed for breakfast was the cherry on top, and far beyond the call of duty. Our only regret is not staying longer. Thank you so much! Best wishes, Charlie, Kirsten, Esme and Jesse"

Bigger than we expected and a lot of stuff to do. My husband loved the darts and my daughter loved the horses and yard. There were also board games, balls and frisbees to play with. It was very clean and the bed was pretty comfy. Also really appreciated the few items in the fridge. Great price for what it is. Will for sure stay here again if we ever come back to the dalles."

Stayed over a week",Debi's place is right in the heart of the Dalles. It is quiet and comfortable. The atmosphere is warm and relaxing and reflects Debi and Jim's love of horses and other neat critters. Outside by the stable Mill creek runs by. Beautiful. Most appreciated by us was Debi's flexibility. We were here waiting the birth of our grandson Jack. Things diden't work out as planned. I ended up in the hospital my self. Debi worked with us to make our stay just what we hoped it would be...a really wonderful family experience.

Stayed one night","My two friends and I stayed here for one night - and ended up wishing we could have stayed for two! Although we were only stopping off in The Dalles on our way from Bend to Seattle, we really ended up loving this AirBNB. The beds were VERY comfortable (especially after two nights on couches and air mattresses) and the location was very quiet, were led to a very restful night! Even though the unit is under the rest of the house, the light colored woods and windows help make it not feel claustrophobic. We also super appreciated that breakfast fixings were provided by Debi - yogurt, Dave's Bread, eggs, and fresh blueberries!

Although we didn't get much of a chance to hang around in the morning, we did get to say hello to the goats (adorable!) and attempt to coax the horses out of the barn into the 90 degree sunshine (it didn't work). We also stopped in town to visit Oregon's oldest bookstore, which we absolutely adored - and were able to find (after a friend had mentioned it in passing) thanks to the many helpful brochures provided by Debi! We will definitely keep this place in mind if we ever find ourselves in The Dalles again."

Stayed one night","Mill Creek Get-Away might be called ""Paradise on Mill Creek"" for the overall comfort, beauty, and conveniences of the accommodation. Our hostess, Debi, met us in the driveway (which is a very steep approach) and guided us where out utility trailer could be placed. She helped us carry in our luggage. She gave us a personal tour of the apartment, the amenities, and opened a well-stocked frig and pantry for our use. The apartment is all wood and clean, comfortable and spacious. Excellent Wi-Fi connections and entertainment on a gigantic large screen TV. The bedroom (as is the entire apartment) was beautifully decorated and the bed was supremely comfortable. We relaxed, enjoyed the views, walked the garden and enjoyed the flowers, and had a quiet, pleasant night under her roof. There is nothing that she could do any better that I can think of. But, it all began with her lovely personality and the warm welcome. I highly recommend that hosts greet their guests."

The welcoming aura of her home heightened the overall experience of our weekend trip. The furniture and amount of space was truly comforting, and the amenities provided were such a great plus. The horses and goats on Debi's property were also unbelievably cute. My partner and I honestly didn't want to leave; it felt like we were staying at a relative's cute home in the countryside. Debi also recommended a really great place for breakfast the morning of our departure - Momma Janes - which was a short walk down the road. I highly recommend this Airbnb for anyone staying in or near The Dalles!"

I had emailed about some local stores that sell organic food and she gave us names of a couple of places that we could shop at. She was very thoughtful and provided some organic foods in the refrigerator for us. The description was accurate. The beds were very comfortable. We loved the setting of the home. We enjoyed walking down to the creek. It was very peaceful and relaxing. When we were wondering what to do with our teenage boys she recommended going to the frisbee golf park. Debi even let us borrow her husband's discs so our boys could play. They had a great time! Highly recommend her place.

This is one of those rare finds and we would definitely stay here again.

Stayed a few nights","Debi's getaway was even better than advertised. Natural wood walls, modern floors, beautiful bathroom and kitchen and a super comfy bed. The fireplace had candles in it and Debi left us a little anniversary treat on the table. The living room looks out onto a perfect lawn and birch tree with birds nesting in it. Tons of natural light and super quiet.

I liked that Debi welcomed us warmly and then let us be unless we sought her out or emailed. The fridge was stocked with breakfast and staples. The kitchen cupboards had all the little stuff you never remember but that you need at a home away from home. There were indoor and outdoor games, puzzles and a dart board. I forgot my shampoo and conditioner... viola, she had some in the bathroom.

We're animal people so we asked if we could socialize with her animals onsite. None of them made a peep otherwise but were so friendly when approached. We made friends with one of the horses and had coffee with a friendly goat.

Debi and Paul made sure the fire pit was all prepped with kindling, matches and cured wood and hubby and I sat by the creek to crackling firewood with marshmallows and something to sip on.

This place is a haven. We can't wait to come back."

Stayed one night","The house is a gorgeous space with a beautiful view of Mt Adams. There is plenty of space, a large bedroom, a private deck (no view), a small clawfoot tub, and giant windows letting in a lot of light. Ample bedroom and bathroom amenities were provided. Unfortunately the space was not as private as we anticipated. You must walk through the owners kitchen/living room to get to the guest space. The guest's living room has no door to separate it from the owner's space so sound carries throughout the house. The guest bathroom does have a door but it doesn't lock, and the rafters above the bathroom door are open to the rest of the house so privacy seems limited. We stayed there on Thanksgiving evening and the host was quite grumpy with us for not being able to check in while we were having dinner with our family. The reason she was rude about it, she said, was that she had work early at 4am but when we left at 9:30am she apologized for not saying goodbye, having to sleep in."

Or it’s a short drive to all The Dalles has to offer. Billie is a generous, considerate, and thoughtful host – reflected in this outstanding accommodation – which exceeded our expectations."

The setup is very comfortable; the room is shared, but it is on the second floor and the whole floor is the guest room, so it feel very private. There's a sitting area with big windows that's the perfect place to relax after a day of hiking. The bed is comfortable. The kitchen has all the necessities and it's clean and organized.

Not to everyone's taste but a splendid example of the style - worth a stay just to experience it if you are interested in architecture. The uphill back of the house feels a little congested but the big entry level living room and the upstairs (guest) suite sitting room both face expansive views and feel spacious and comfortable. Tastefully decorated with interesting artifacts and artwork, well equipped, comfortable and pretty quiet. Barney the dog is big and friendly and didn't trigger any allergic reaction for me. Billie is a warm and friendly host, gracious and helpful. We'll book with her again if we have occasion to stay overnight in The Dalles. The town has it's own charm, with an interesting setting, some spectacular scenery and quite decent restaurants."

Barney is a sweetie, Billie is a fabulous host with great restaurant referrals! Would have never stopped at the Hi-Way House based on the exterior but trusted Billie and so glad we did.

Stayed a few nights","Billie’s place was amazing! The view of Mt. Adams from our living room on the third floor was breathtaking. The space was cozy and welcoming. Billie’s dog, Barney Fife, was the sweetest boy and so happy to entertain myself and my fiancé. Unfortunately, I came down with covid 2 days before we were supposed to fly back home. Billie was so supportive and understanding. She made me soup and worked with us and our schedule as we had to extend our travels in order for me to quarantine for the proper amount of time. We look forward to staying here again whenever we are back in Oregon!"

Stayed a few nights","I have never ever experienced such a Horrible place like this. She’s constantly texted me & would get mad if I didn’t respond. She’s very very intrusive, nosy, disrespectful, & mad me feel like a prisoner. She thought that we were gone because the car wasn’t out front. She texted me asking if we wanted tea. I didn’t respond & not even 10mins later she was upstairs in the private living room. I was in the bathroom & heard her. So I made sure the door was shut. A couple minutes later she throws her dogs ball in the room pretending like he did it (just incase one of us was there) & the door was opened. I was not clothed & told her that 3 times grabbing sheets to cover up with because she wouldn’t leave until she heard in my voice how mad & upset I was. But she didn’t leave the private area for awhile blaming her dog & asking if I wanted tea. All activities and plans were gone because I couldn’t leave the room with our stuff in it. I also was threatened to be kicked out if I didn’t allow her in because we had our service dog there sometimes. I was told I was breaking Airbnb policy with my S. Dog & she to come in. I told her I had a migraine & can this wait & her response was “oh I know how painful that is”. But then she said I’m wasting time and it’s my choice. (Let her in or get kicked out) I called them after she finally left the room and she was texting me that she was told the wrong thing and started back peddling & trying to say sorry but she was told the wrong info.
This place will only work for people who want to interact with her, hangout with her, & get 4 or more messages before noon.
I do want to thank the Airbnb Support Team for everything they did."

Stayed a few nights","Although the space was cozy and lovely, it didn't feel private because it had more of a loft feel than a separate enclosed space, so there was concern about noise carrying down to the host.
The bathtub (which was the main selling point for us) was adorable but tiny, and because the overflow drain hadn't been repaired so it wouldn't leak downstairs, you couldn't fill the tub very full, so taking a bath wasn't relaxing.
The way the host interacted with us felt more like she thought of us as visiting friends or family instead of random guests paying to use her space, so some of our conversations were more personal than we were comfortable with.
Overall, this was not the best fit for the experience we were looking for."

I was able to take my dad for a day outing on the scenic gorge sternwheeler in Cascade Lockes. Billie was a wonderful host and easy to communicate with. She made sure I had everything I needed for a pleasant stay. I highly recommend the Eagles nest for your next visit to the Dalles.

There is a large, comfortable, well appointed great room that you get to enjoy all to yourself. It has an amazing view of The Dalles, the Columbia River and the mountain. You really can birdwatch from the front and the back, and I'm not sure if I saw ospreys or eagles but they were one or the other. Billie is an attentive, accommodating, and thoughtful hostess and her dog is adorable and extremely well mannered. She put lots of interesting reading material out, filtered water, some light snacks, tea, coffee, and a list of the best spots to visit while in The Dalles. I wish I could have stayed for two nights but count myself lucky to have managed to book the one Saturday. I hope to stay again some day."

The space is huge (900 ish sq ft) with a full separate living room and a bedroom with queen bed and balcony and overlooking a wooded hillside.

Stayed a few nights","After reading all of the glowing reviews, I had high expectations for staying at Billie's place, and she exceeded all of them! First of all, she's a very caring human being, and her communication with me, both before and during my stay, was great! She makes very helpful recommendations depending on the purpose of and time of your trip. I was there mostly for the annual Eagle Watch and to delve into local history.
Her rental is a beautiful, cozy place. I was so pleased to have a quiet place to come at night, after my daytime walks and adventures in The Dalles. I appreciated having the private bathroom and a little refrigerator upstairs. Billie makes her kitchen available, and if there's anything else you need during your trip, she makes the effort to get it for you or tell you where you can find it.
I had taken the Columbia Gorge Express bus from Portland (via Hood River), and even though that presented some challenges, I was able to navigate and enjoy The Dalles in an adventurous way. The Link bus city bus service drops you off very close to Billie's place.
On top of all the care and comforts, there's her dog Barney Fife, who always greets you with a happily wagging tail. :)
Highly recommended host and place!"

She has such a big list of coupons for exciting things to do around Dalles, especially coffee at The Riv <3 The house is absolutely beautiful. The entire upper floor has 3 sections. A living area, bath area and a huge bedroom. The bed is super comfortable. The location of this house is a real advantage. Scenic view in the morning and is walking distance from Sorosis Park. Just book this place already!!"

Stayed a few nights","Our Host, Billie was warm and friendly. It was like visiting your favorite aunt. She provided us with coupons for multiple restaurants and a local winery who knew Billie and treated us like family. The location is near The Dalles downtown and not a far drive from historical landmarks. You can even do a quick drive to the southern region of Washington State, which makes for great photos of the Columbia River and The Dalles Bridge. My husband and I slept comfortably like babies through the night. The house itself has spectacular views and a quiet space to reflect and relax. Thank you Billie for your hospitality, the city of The Dalles offered rich history and scenic views, but coming back to rest in your home made our stay more worth while. Would come back again!"

We got to see the parade in the town and discover some local restaurants. The check in process was easy and Billie was there to show us around. She always made sure we had everything we needed. She went above and beyond to provide refreshments, soaps, Epsom salts, and fresh towels. We explored the surrounding area and would recommend an easy hike to Tamawanas Falls and renting Kayaks at Trillium Lake."

Stayed with a pet","Four adults and one small dog spent a wonderful long weekend at the house over Memorial Day. It was exactly as described with a gorgeous view. It would comfortably suit 3 couples (yay for king beds!) and is in a great location for wine tasting, scenic drives and hikes, if that’s your thing. We loved sitting on either of the decks with our coffee in the morning and a glass of wine in the evening while watching river traffic float by and hawks soar above.
The house is on a pretty narrow flag lot but we didn’t have any issues finding the house or staying out of the shared driveway with our car. The neighbors waved hello and we enjoyed seeing the kiddos playing outside. Overall, a welcoming and quiet place to stay.
Definitely recommend."

Thoughtful touches were a bedside headlamp, wine and snacks upon arrival; extra quilts for cold nights; and large TV with Roku. Colin also had tons of brochures, booklets, and maps of the area. The house has really good security.
I would not say the location is particularly walkable to downtown, but downtown is just a very short drive away.
Colin responded immediately when I had a minor problem opening the front door lock. He is a terrific host.
I have no hesitation in recommending Colin’s place. My overall feeling is that I certainly picked a winner of an Airbnb house!"

Stayed about a week","Awesome home, spacious & clean. Hosts were extremely quick to respond to questions. The view of the Gorge from inside the home was amazing; you can watch trains & ships go by. Kitchen was well stocked, including coffee amenities, basic condiments & spices. Plenty of towels, tissue, soap etc. Big smart TV in the living room, so we could watch my favorite streaming channels, and a g00gle-mini to set alarms and ask questions.

The half-bathroom downstairs was handy because we didn’t spend much time upstairs. There’s no TV in the bedrooms & I can’t sleep without a TV on, so we crashed in the living room. Wish the living room had a curtain though. The window is likely uncovered to show off the amazing view but I’m prefer privacy, especially at night. Also a heads up, the front steps are taller than any I’ve experienced before, so be prepared, anyone with mobility issues might need help up those two steps. I would totally come back here again though because it really was a nice home."

Great time - the place had everything we needed to celebrate our father’s 98th birthday.
Very Spacious - the house had plenty of room
Very comfortable- the furniture and the large king beds were very comfortable.
Very Clean - the house feels brand new.
It has many items for pets and still was especially clean with no signs of a pet being there. Several in our family are allergic to cats and dogs and the was no problem for them.
Very Close - close to all The Dalles grocery stores, restaurants, pubs, and amazing murals.
Very interesting and educational- there are many great museums within five to thirty minutes. An exotic animal sanctuary is just across the river."

The house does sit above a rail spur so there is a lot of rail car noise. It would not have bothered me if I had not been traveling with a noise-sensitive hound. That being said, I highly recommend this home-away-from-home. It is divine."

From the board games in the closet to the great decks overlooking the river...this place was beautiful. We especially appreciated all of the quick communication, attention to detail, and little touches that made our stay even more lovely. Will surely book again!"

Stayed a few nights","This home is worth exploring whether or not you have an express interest in staying within America’s most majestic Pacific Northwest. And now, as for the home itself, it’s pristinely clean, exquisitely updated, and full of singularly spectacular features, such as a to-die-for hot tub/bath for two and balconies adorning each of its floors, delivering panaramic views of Oregon’s surreal landscapes. And back to the home. the staircase was beautiful as well, and the bedrooms were overly spacious, clean, & comfortable. The same applies for the bathrooms—newly remodeled, large, and a pleasure to use. The home also contained many small extras exempt in other places—spices, ziploc bags, a wide variety of kitchen appliances, and more. Couldn’t have been happier to have enjoyed a small vacation there. Absolutely sublime."

It has a great little private back yard for our dog to feel comfortable doing his 'duty'. Overall LOVED this home, and would definitely stay here again. Thank you!"

Our dog was also welcomed, relaxed, and comfortable! Colin's quick and friendly communication throughout the stay was also much appreciated. If I could give it more than 5 stars I would.

I admit I’m glued to either my phone screen or tv screen but when I was able to see the river from most of the windows in the home, I would just watch the water. It’s very relaxing. Check in was quick and easy. I entered the incorrect code and the host quickly answered and helped me.
I brought my puppy and I was overjoyed that there are wood floors and cleaner for any accidents. My kiddo also enjoyed the huge bed and toys in one of the huge bedrooms. The master bathroom jet tub is out of this world! The entire home is spacious and I enjoyed drinking a cup of coffee on the balcony in the master bedroom.
The host mentions the parking space and I have a huge suv that fit comfortably in the space provided. This home is very very very clean, like it feels brand new. I have nothing negative to say at all! I can’t wait to book this home again!"

We checked in late, so, we didn't have an opportunity to relax in the adjoining section with the table tennis table. But we relaxed in the living room in the main section. The outdoor was very tastefully done.
The kitchen was fully equipped, so, we were able to prepare a simple breakfast (bacon, eggs, toast bread, coffee).
I am not sure if it was an over-sight but there was no shower gel in either of the two bathrooms. Fortunately, we had our own alternatives that we could make do with.
Net, we would highly recommend this lodging. Thanks to Britnei for making this wonderful space available."

The garage with the glass door provided a nice eating spot on a cool evening, while the outside fireplace would provide another such spot. Chairs in several more locations with a view of the mountain provided even more gathering spots. We loved the house and may stop there again."

Everything was completely clean. Smelled wonderful when we walked in. Best beds EVER! Slept so well.
Private home and backyard allowed us to unwind and enjoy our time together. Had a little “date night”; We grilled out and ate dinner by the fire. Had fun playing ping pong the rest of the night.
100% would recommend this home. If we are ever in the area, we’d love to stay again!"

Stayed with kids","I didn’t think I’d find much last minute for my son’s birthday trip as I searched all over the coast for something even remotely reasonably priced. Then for some reason I searched east instead, and this place popped up! Minutes to the river, gorgeous views from the backyard of the rolling hills, beautiful furnishings, lots of space, fun garage space to play in. The garage especially was so nice to relax in, with the lightly lavender-scented breeze flowing straight through. A/C throughout!
BUT THE BEDS!!!! We’ve stayed in a lot of hotels and AirBnBs, and these beds—I kid you not—were by far the most comfortable we’ve ever used. I was actually recovering from surgery on this trip and I had a hard time not laying in bed for WAY too long each morning. My 11 year old son was mad because “the bed was so comfortable I stayed in it for too long!”
Sorosis Park just around the corner has a huge playground and bar park, plus a beautiful rose garden and views of the river. Our stay was amazing!"

Stayed one night","Great stay! The home is in a safe, private neighborhood, thus quiet. Upon arrival, we must have excited two dogs next door however after the neighbor finished yard work, we never heard them again. The house was fully loaded! Anything and everything we could have needed. All clean inside. I felt like we were trespassing as this home was filled with personal items and decor with the whole 1970's vibe going on, quite unique. The yard was immaculate! Really lovely. And though we did not use, it could not have been a more pleasant patio and yard set up. The converted garage was really cool, but we only peeked in. Ours was just a quick one night stay; we didn't even need the bathroom showers (though very clean). Grateful for the Keurig in the AM and the mountain view. Liked being so close to Sorosis Park, I-84 and any needed conveniences. Liked the notebook filled with things to do. Check in and check out couldn't have been smoother. Not much communication needed. Britnei made it so easy."

Stayed about a week","Spent a fantastic week at Victor's place, pictures actually don't do it justice...much larger space than it looks like and you can tell Victor has done a marvelous job at restoring an old historic property. He met me at check-in time and was very friendly and most helpful with local recommendations which turned out great and very much enjoyed talking with him on a couple of occasions. Very walkable to many Downtown Bars and Restaurants and in the other direction less than a 10 minute walk to the Supermarket, couldn't have been more convenient but was also very peaceful and a quiet neighborhood. I would not hesitate to stay here again and would definitely recommend Victor's place to anyone visiting The Dalles."

He has spent a lot of time renovating this historic home. Some of the inside is period and some is not. It sounds like he intends to update with more period pieces as he is able but the house needed such extensive repair to save it, he had to make some consessions. He is building a coffee house in the bottom floor off the courtyard, which would be amazing! The electric fireplace was not functional but he told is it had only just stopped working. The wall heaters in the other rooms worked fine. There is one full sized bed which was very comfortable. It is a little on the firm side with a pillow top. The neighborhood has many beautiful historic buildings and homes with walkable restaurants. Since no one else was checking in, Victor offered to let us check out a little late which was very thoughtful & appreciated!"

Stayed one night","Beautiful apartment with the most thoughtful interior extras we've found in an Airbnb, especially in the kitchen and bathroom where there were all the towels, utensils, and incidental extras one could need. Lovely linens and very comfortable bed, great shower. Getting into the house when loaded with bags was awkward due to several funky steps and a gate, so care there is advised. And the yard and outdoor furnishings were not maintained in condition to be enjoyed, which was disappointing. But for our purposes on a one-night stay, we were very happy with the spacious apartment and appreciated the convenient location and the excellent unusual touches in the kitchen such as ice, spring water, juices and chocolates."

Gorgeous plants inside and out. The bed was luscious. I mean, I melted into it (which worked out well because they have the most generous checkout time.) The kitchen was cute and had just about anything you would need to feel at home if your home also has a well stocked coffee bar. Glorious water pressure in the shower, just kneading the exhaustion right out of my shoulders. Honestly when we checked in we were kicking ourselves for not booking multiple days this time. I can’t express how lovely a stay here can be. It was too hot to walk around the neighborhood this time, but we walked to a cute coffee shop last time and just loved the area. Really sweet spot in the gorge."

Plus fresh flowers on the table by the bed! Just a lovely touch. The AC unit worked very well during the hot weather. We actually also appreciated the 10 O'clock 'quiet hour' the hosts ask for. It's sad that has to be stated outright, but it was great to be able to count on a good night's sleep. If we go to The Dalles again, we'll definitely want to stay here.

Plus, they’re great people to chat with. The kitchen is super well equipped, and little touches like coffee and snacks made our stay feel generous and welcoming. Lots of bath amenities too. While you’re here, do try The Riv Cafe for breakfast, brunch, or lunch. It’s just 2 blocks away and the food and ambiance are terrific."

Stayed one night","I don’t usually write reviews, but this was by far the most accommodating Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. They had everything you think you might need: snacks, shampoo, bandaids, mouthwash, ice water, waffles, etc etc. I usually end up needing a band aid whenever I travel for whatever reason and this is the first time I found one at our Airbnb. Small thing I know, but it’s the small things and this place has all of it!
Also great location near in the Dalles for attractions. It was also 107 degrees outside and the AC worked great!"

Four of us stayed at Dan's house for a bike race in Dufur and it was the perfect location for us. The territorial view from the front window is beatiful and the light coming through the dining room wiindows lent a very peaceful feel to the space. We will be looking to book this space again next year. Thank you Dan!"

I have a bit of a unique situation as I'm in The Dalles for a few months working and their home was a perfect fit for my needs (sorry to everyone for hogging it for so long!). Their space is well decorated and comfortable. As someone who lives on the road full time and uses airbnb often, I have to say this is the most well appointed and clean space I've rented to date. Great location on a quiet street, just up the hill from the downtown area, this place is a really good find with some obvious history to it. Jason and Courtney are a super cool couple who are only a phone call or text away, if needed. Happy to give you a local tip or a helping hand, they even went as far as (considering I'm working some long days without much free time) to tidy the place for me every week or so which has been really helpful. Thanks to them and their amazing space for making life on the road pleasant!"

The interior layout is an open design with tastefully appointed furnishings and a fascinating display of pictures representative of the area. In addition, there is a wide variety of live plants that complement the already serene atmosphere. The home has a breathtaking view of the Columbia River, the nearby dam and city views which mesmerize both day and night. When you open the inside door to the garage, you find yourself in the ultimate game room where a wide variety of table games from ping pong, pool, darts, etc. entices you to a friendly competition in comfortable surroundings. In the main living room there is a wall unit with numerous board games for all ages.
The house is kept extremely clean and the bedrooms are perfect for all ages. This was a very pet friendly house especially for our blind dog since there are no stairs to maneuver. This is a true dream house."

The list of wondrous ""things"" could go on but suffice it to say this home is like the home of the rich and famous. Certainly we are NOT (rich and famous) so how lovely that Taylor provides this home for Air BNB clients who love to travel and try to upgrade their lives by a few days (or more, when possible) away from home. I will always remember this beautiful, elegant home and how we felt while being there. Taylor also was caring, responsive and obviously a conscientious, people-oriented person.

Cooked a Beautiful large dinner, found some wonderful serving dishes, The French dishes in the lower cabinet ❤️ The dining area fits a large family. All of us thought the beds were comfortable. We didn’t get to enjoy the deck for long, because of the weather, but we look forward to a return where we can spend many hours just taking it in. We’re not big TV watchers, when we are together, but it did not go unnoticed that there is a TV in each bedroom and living room. And coffee snobs like us, as coffee roasters there are French presses! The knives left a little bit to be desired, but at least there was knives! It’s a wonderful home, and the stay was lovely. And thank you for the children’s books and games, The home is super family friendly!"

Stayed with a pet","We were big fans of this house, but the icing on the cake is the view. Both the primary suite and the living space face the Columbia gorge, and the ability to experience its beauty from inside (temps were cold) was a huge treat. There is a big deck and I’m hoping to come back in the summer and “waste” the enjoying the beauty from one of the provided loungers.
I was also really appreciative of our hosts, who went out of their way to make sure we had a good time. I really appreciated knowing that they cared and would be willing to help or address needs if they did come up, and that they wanted to make the house and the experience the best it could be."

This was the last night of our 10 day tour through Oregon and it was the perfect place to relax and rest before our PDX flight. (The drive back to the airport also takes you along the Gorge for more spectacular views!)

Okay the house itself is spotless with great natural lighting. Spacious living/entertaining space and modern kitchen amenities. The rooms are comfy and cozy, we all slept like babies!
And the VIEW. It’s just breathtaking and totally would’ve stayed for another day to just enjoy the house/view/amenities.
We got to the place late at night and I have to say the steep uphill loose gravel drive was a little scary and unexpected when it’s pitch dark all around .. the map I am following made me turn just one drive way too early so I had to back up down hill while praying I wouldn’t just roll down the hill. That was a little intense for me at 9:30pm 🤣🤣🤣
But once we got inside we didn’t want to leave, my parents even made me to ask if we can extend the stay. Definitely would stay again if we come by this way!"

I truly felt like I escaped the hustle and bustle of life and it was amazing! Between the cozy spot on the outdoor chair and the hot tub, I didn’t need anything else. I only wish I had more time to spend there. I will be back! Also, Taylor was so fast at responding to messages and for a last min booking especially, that was greatly appreciated.

The kitchen was fully stocked and the entire home was spacious and immaculately clean. Most homes in this area don’t have a hot tub, so this was definitely a bonus. The location was an easy distance to many activities in the gorge including white water rafting and the Columbia Gorge Discovery Center, which my kids enjoyed. Our favorite part of the house was the expansive deck and views of the river. The summer sunset was breathtaking! We will definitely be booking this lovely home again."

Travis made us feel right at home, he was extremely kind and showed/told us a lot about the property. We fell in love with the animals, they were so friendly, their dogs, cats, alpacas, baby bunnies!!!, goats, chickens were amazing, we fed them daily and it was so therapeutic. We made omelettes from farm fresh eggs in the amazing outdoor kitchen by the creek. I bathed in the HOT bathtub every night at sunset, listening to the creek amongst the trees. It is truly luxurious. Fluffy bathrobes are provided, even a towel warmer in the tent! The bed is SO comfy, falling asleep looking at the stars through the clear roof on the tent with the mattress warmer turned on as it turned a bit cooler at night was heavenly. I slept the best I had in ages, the perfect escape."

You have an amazing outdoor kitchen that is well equipped (s'mores, coffee, etc.) and a peaceful creek right next to you with walking trails and lounging areas. I couldn't have asked for more in a glamping experience. Thoughtful touches throughout. You literally have everything and more you could want or need including games, comfortable robes, heated blankets for the bed, towel warmers, etc. It's impossible to name off everything; we did not want to leave.
Thank you for making our weekend an experience we will never forget. Fresh farm eggs and access to the barn was the cherry on top!"

Collecting fresh free-range eggs from the barn added a delightful farm-to-table element to our breakfast, cooked in the creekside tiki-bar with provided pancake mix.
For coffee aficionados like myself, the three different ways to brew coffee were a dream come true. Each cup perfectly complemented the serene morning by the creek. This experience surpassed all expectations and easily earns the title of the best AirBnB we've ever stayed in. Can't wait to return!"

The “tent” was beautifully appointed, warm and cozy. The creek (just outside the tent flap) created the best kind of white noise. It was a wonderful blend of camping and farm stay. We also scoped out some top notch gravel biking (right from the tent) and the road biking in the area is epic. Can wait to come back in the Spring!"
