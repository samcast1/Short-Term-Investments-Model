Stayed over a week","I stayed here for 4 months while I was finishing up my last semester of school, and it was absolutely perfect! Charisse was an incredible host who was always quick to respond to anything I needed help with and just really cared about my comfort. The place was exactly as listed with one of the most comfortable beds I’ve ever had and just the perfect amount of space. It’s the perfect location as well for doing anything as everything in Downtown Provo is very close, but not so close that you have to deal with all the traffic and noise levels. Overall, I 100% recommend this place for everyone - it had everything I needed for a comfortable stay!"

There are so many other restaurants to choose from. It is such a cute little apartment as well. The bed is very comfortable. It has a great tv. We had no complaints whatsoever about this place. I would definitely choose this place again when we come back here.

Stayed a few nights","Very comfortable place to stay. Especially perfect if coming by train or bus. There is parking, however, we did not have a car for our stay. Car was not needed as it was a very easy walk to downtown. Explored trails and area by using Bird Bike and scooters that were easy to fine. Then when we left we walked two blocks to the Car rental place to continue our journey. Provo is fantastic!"

Stayed a few nights","This was a great little house, close to downtown and BYU. It fit my needs perfectly. It was a little chilly, so there were extra heaters I had to use, but with those, it was fine. It's at the end of a residential street, but around it are businesses like an auto garage, pawn shop, and a motel, so be aware of that. It had everything I needed, the bed was comfy, and it's perfect for a quick stay for 1 or 2 people."

Stayed one night","William’s place was awesome!! I was just passing through Provo on my way back home and booked a night’s stay last minute. It was so worth it! The studio was cozy, clean, and had amenities like a washer and dryer and a kitchen with appliances. My boyfriend and I were so impressed with how nice everything was! Plus the location is perfect, it’s walking distance to plenty of local shops and restaurants, and it’s right by the temple too so we were able to do all our sightseeing without having to drive everywhere. We loved everything about it and it ended up being the highlight of our trip! William was awesome too, he was very quick to answer all of our questions . I can’t say enough nice things about this place it was just great!"

The tv was huge which made for great entertainment during our nights in. There wasn’t too much commotion outside and we both slept great every night of our stay. Even though the house is on a frequented street it never once felt like it. It felt very private and it was easy to feel at home! We would 10/10 recommend and 10/10 stay again if available :)
Also Williams response time and communication also gets a 10/10. Wonderful host!"

Stayed a few nights","It was a nice stay definitely cozy, however ! We recommend installing a peephole since we had someone trying to come in into the apartment. it was a bit scary that we couldn’t see who it was, we open the door and it seem like it was an older man confused.
Other than that I really appreciate that this little cozy apartment had absolutely everything you could need thank you so much for having the most great essentials put into this studio. :) I definitely think that’s what made it more cozy and inviting."

Stayed a few nights","An amazing stay! The place was lovely, and very clean- and it had anything you could ever need in a small place like that! The overhead light switches from bright-white to a dim yellow, which was a super cool detail. The oven doesn't have a digital interface to check the temperature, but we figured that sticking a thermometer into a cracked oven-door is super effective. For the price, GO FOR IT!! The only downside is that the place is a tad far from some of the public transport lines, making it a hassle to trek around. I stayed in Provo in November when it was around 50°-60° during the day, obviously it got to the higher 30's at night, but I can only imagine going in January and trying to catch a bus (just make sure you're obviously appropriately dressed for Utah weather!), and having to walk quite a ways. But that's not a huge deal. Over all, amazing stay, and I would definitely stay again if I had better method of transport, but that's an issue on my end! Happy traveling everyone!"

The bed was comfortable, I had everything I needed, and I was close to BYU and the other places I was going. It was a little tricky parking my big car 😉 and there was a loud noise in the middle of the night from the upstairs neighbors (maybe the hot water since that was the case in the bathroom I used?) along with some stomping around, but nothing major. I would stay here again."

All the finishes felt top notch, well thought out, and clean. If we get the chance to be extras in Utah again, we'd definitely have this place on the top of our list of AirBnb's to stay at. The only other thing I would say is that it would be nice to have some more blinds/curtains especially in the bathrooms. Other than that, it was absolutely perfect! One of the best AirBnB's we've stayed at. So grateful for this wonderful, homey, and high-end place to stay during our time here!"

It’s in the backyard (you can see the main house from the glass doors in the living room on the listing) of the host’s home so not super private. I didn’t feel comfortable opening the curtains often because I value my privacy. The host was filming a reality show which I wasn’t told about and there was a small issue getting out of the shared driveway due to the film crew. I would’ve appreciated some notice about that. I also don’t think I should be responsible for finishing the laundry from the previous guest which filled the washer and dryer. I had to specifically ask for the master bath to have towels before I realized they were all in the dryer. Otherwise a great stay."

Stayed one night","I had an amazing stay at guest house hosted by Mort and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable, convenient, and overall fantastic experience. The space itself was super clean, spacious, and well-located. We appreciated the thoughtful touches throughout the Airbnb, such as the comfortable bedding, and stylish decor.

Overall, my stay was everything I could have asked for and more. I would definitely book again in the future and highly recommend it to anyone visiting the area."

Stayed a few nights","This place could easily be 5 stars with a little maintenance.
The pros:
- Very clean (except for moldy/stained shower curtain)
- Nicely decorated and plenty of space
- Very comfortable beds and bedding
- Beautiful and quiet location
- Well-stocked kitchen
The cons:
- Only 2 washcloths for 4 people. We notified host but she didn't offer to do anything to remedy the situation so we had to buy or own washcloths.
- No hot water in 1st floor shower which meant my 88 year-old dad had to go to the 3rd floor to shower. When we told the host, she said that she was already aware of the problem. I think she should have notified us before that the shower was not useable.
- No shower gel even though it is listed as an included amenity.
- Only 2 small washing machine pods so bring your own if you plan to use the washer.
- Shower curtain was moldy/stained.
- Solid dripping faucet in bathroom.
- Bathroom sink did not drain.
- Need to strip beds, start a load of laundry and take all trash outside."

Group trip","We had a really nice stay here. The layout involves a number of stairs but the rooms are spacious and the beds are comfortable, the space is clean, quiet neighboorhood, close to downtown and we had almost everything we needed. The kitchen was well stocked. We did encounter a few relatively minor issues such as not receiving our check-in information the morning-of as advertised, difficulty using some of the devices such as the sinks (the automatic sink, and figuring out how to make the bathroom sinks drain), the downstairs shower, the lights, and the front door which we couldn’t make lock from the outside so we had to rely on the 3-minute auto-lock function. We lost access to opening/closing the garage door the following morning after checking in and couldn't get the car out until that was resolved.
Overall a good experience. Sydney was responsive and helpful.
Overall, the space provided what we needed with a few hiccups here and there."

Stayed a few nights","First impression from the outside was not good. Building is in need of some care. Front door blind broken in many spots, building needs painting, etc. and the cleaners had locked the door handle so automatic door lock didn't work. Jason got back to me within 30 minutes. The inside of the condo is very nice, new carpeting and clean. My only suggestions are to have hand towels in the bathrooms and replace the kitchen faucet with regular faucet. The sensor on faucet was not responsive and was very frustrating to use.
Also, parking spots are not clearly marked. Paint worn off and neighbor was parked in the condo's spot, which I didn't know. I was towed while using the visitor spot. I was not happy as I got there after 10:00pm and that was the only available spot. I had to pay to retrieve my car. I hope the owners will refund my $100. The parking is not clear in the inside book.
I would stay again now knowing what I know"

There is enough seating in the living room for my family of 5 to comfortably watch a movie together and have a meal around the dining table. You can enjoy a beautiful sunset from the living area, master bedroom, or upstairs guest bedroom each night. It is a little tricky to find using maps for iPhone but we managed. Its in a nice, quiet location and though its a townhome, we could not hear anyone around us. Plenty of options for watching TV (netflix, hulu, disney plus etc). We highly recommend!"

Stayed about a week","This place was lovely! Terrific location, near to everything in Provo, but in a very quiet location. Kitchen is well stocked with bowls, plates, cutlery, and even some baking stuff which we used. Beds and bedding were comfortable and immaculate. It was just the right size for our family of four. The TV/living room area and sectional couch came with plenty of pillows and comfy blankets and easily fit two lazy adults and two teenagers when we decompressed after enjoying the outdoors. There were even some games and even a few Thomas the Tank Engine tracks. We’re coming back to this same place in February!"

We found it a little dirty and dusty in places and the kitchen could have been better equipped. The walls are extremely thin as mentioned in previous comments but nothing that really disturbed us. A comfortable stay. Thank you

We had plenty of room for our family and were extremely comfortable with the amenities provided. A heads up that check-out procedures require a little of your time (30ish min - stripping beds, etc), which we were happy to do, but some parties may need to know ahead of time for booking. We are planning a return trip to Provo next summer and would happily stay at Sydney’s place again."

The way the house is set up makes it easy to all hang out together, but also provides ample space for family members to find a quiet place to rest and relax too. We did a lot of cooking at home and the kitchen easily had the cookware needed.
Only suggestion for improvement, or something I would bring next time, would be a baby safety gate. Upon entry there is a steep wooden staircase the top of which is by the living room and we had to be on high alert to keep our toddler from trying to go down it."

Group trip","We loved our stay at this stylish townhome in Provo! It is close to BYU, and was within walking distance to our daughters’ apartment. The layout is great for a family, it feels more like a home and less like a townhome. We loved hanging out together on the main floor, had plenty of room for dining and watching movies at night. It was very clean, the beds were very comfortable, and the kitchen well-stocked. Shampoo/conditioner in the bathroom and plenty of towels and blankets available. The laundry room is conveniently located next to the kitchen so we could multi-task while making meals.
I don’t usually comment on carpet, but this carpet is amazing! I wanted to take it home with us! All in all, a really great place to stay in Provo.
We highly recommend Sydney’s place and will definitely return again!"

The beds are very comfy, the carpet new and soft, the living spaces (kitchen, dining, sofa area) are big. Clean and beautiful! This being a townhouse among many townhouses, there are stairs to get in and stairs inside, and neighbors sharing walls on both sides.
Fortunately the neighbors were quite quiet when we were there. Nice, too, that there were 2 parking spaces."

The tub was great for a bubble bath. (I brought my own supplies.) I was hoping to find something to watch on Roku, but there wasn't much of a selection, so I just watched something on my laptop in bed, which suited me just fine. Marie and Reed communicated really well. Great experience overall!"

Stayed with kids","The first day the host was rude when I asked if my 3 year old daughter could play in the sandbox. I almost didn't ask because every other Airbnb I had stayed at (100's of them) were always willing to share their entire backyard, including kids toys. So from day one I felt uncomfortable at this hosts house. Their reply was that ""I was limited to the basement dwelling."" That was rude! Another thing is that the shrubs and roses were hanging way out over the walkway so I had to walk on the grass, I didn't dare say anything. Oh and the grass was about 6-8 inches long, hadn't been mowed in 4-6 weeks, so it was harder to walk on. I would have offered to mow it for them but they were rude to me so I didn't. The futon bed was extremely uncomfortable to sleep on so I slept on the roll-away, which was also uncomfortable. There is no kitchen table, just a countertop with 2 chairs, so don't plan on having dinner here with more than 2 people. Internet was fast and they let me do an early check-in."

Stayed a few nights","Everything was fine and as described, except the location description says, “downtown & BYU.” It was about 15 or so min away from both which was a bit disappointing. We live about 20-25 min away anyway, and wanted to stay somewhere close enough for going to and from BYU, within 2-5 min for woman’s conf. to avoid problems with parking and getting up early. Plus we were interested in more of a downtown or campus type atmosphere. Instead we were in a neighborhood southwest of all of that. I should have paid better attention to the address, but went more by the description.
It’s comfortable & cute. The owners seemed friendly and checked on us through Airbnb a couple of times. Didn’t need to use air mattress or couch for sleeping, bed was comfortable. Had access to Netflix, Amazon prime, and other streaming apps. Everything you will need for kitchen/bathroom. Clean. Will recommend for people visiting and are okay with the location."

Dings and scrapes to the walls and doors. Could use some touch-ups. A little water damage in the bathroom, and the microwave was a bit burnt. Nothing too terrible. It's a bit noisy with the upstairs as a family lives there. Good communication from Host.
Really needs a coffee pot. The unit is clean and has the basics. Very reasonable price and close to anything you might need."

The place itself is exactly as listed and pictured. Very clean. Very quaint and quiet. They were sure to check to make sure we didn’t need anything else and answered the couple of questions I did have very quickly and were extremely kind in the process. I would definitely recommend and will most likely stay again. 5 stars in every category!

The one thing I actually I wish was there was toothpaste but otherwise, we had everything for an enjoyable stay. Checking in, and Entry Code was easily provided, and the couple gave us our space, but still were available by messaging. Overall great experience. 10/10, would recommend."

The only complaint we would have is how uncomfortable the seating is. It was not fun to sit around and watch a movie because there was no comfortable place to sit. But… the pictures acutely showed the furnishings and they were in good repair. We should have paid attention to that knowing that was part of our plans."

Stayed a few nights","A friend and I spent two nights here for a mini writing retreat, and both of us loved it. The whole place smelled amazing and was very clean. The main room was bright and airy when the sun was out, filled with artwork and books and other lovely touches. When the sun went down, it felt warm and cozy — the perfect place to curl up and chat and drink some tea while watching the snow fall. There were tons of wonderful touches, such as fresh flowers, comfy pillows and blankets, a white noise machine, hand-written notes with instructions, and a variety of seating options. The location was great, too. The neighborhood was quiet and had a nice vibe, while still being accessible to restaurants and shopping. It seemed a good area to go for walks/runs/bike rides when the weather is nice.
Although we never spoke in person, the woman who rented to us was friendly, helpful, and communicative via the app, and even left us a little something for when we checked in!
Would definitely recommend!"

Stayed one night","My first impression was how cute and cozy it looked and felt. Seretta was extremely friendly, helpful, kind and quick to respond. Like a few others have mentioned, I wasn't aware that the shower/tub combo is an ADA accessible sitting tub with handheld shower head. This also was not a deal-breaker for us, but I don't think it's made clear in the description that this is not a standard shower/tub combination. My husband is over 6’ so it was tricky for him to shower. Not ideal for someone who wants to take a quick shower. If I could’ve, I would’ve given it 4.5 stars (only because of the shower/tub) but I wouldn’t give it less than that. It had everything we needed and best of all it was very close to the place we needed to go. If the shower/tub combo doesn’t bother you, I would 100% recommend this place!"

Stayed a few nights","Location, host and place was good. However, 2 big drawbacks;
1. For a private space, you wouldn’t expect a door that leads literally directly to the hallway of the host’s house. Made us feel pretty uncomfortable knowing that there was a flimsy door blocking the other living space
2. There pretty much wasn’t a shower or kitchen; only a bathtub with a handheld shower head and a microwave and mini fridge.
I guess it was described correctly but just doesn’t seem like it was described as in detail as it should’ve been.
Place was however extraordinarily clean and came with some basic amenities to feel comfortable. For the price, I would recommend with these 2 things in mind."

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I stayed there for four nights. We absolutely loved our stay. This was a safe neighborhood with easy access to everything in Provo and Orem. The area has plenty of restaurants, with many within walking distance. Directly across the street are The Shops at Riverwoods. This had one of the better-equipped kitchens compared to a few other places that I have stayed. Bathroom supplies were plentiful. The condo was immaculate, and the beds were very comfortable. It had a Novafoam bed. I know this because before I left, I stripped everything to find the brand name. While I usually wouldn't say I like memory foam, I loved this bed! The master bathroom has a large, jetted bathtub. This was of better value when I compared it to hotels in the area. Haley was very responsive to any messages that I sent. This will undoubtedly be on the top of my list of places to stay again in Provo."

There are extra blankets and pillows, a fluffy throw blanket for the couch, and lots of fluffy towels in the bathrooms. The decor is warm and inviting, and everything, from the walls, to the furniture, to the kitchen, is sparkly new and clean. We especially appreciated the basket of snacks that were awaiting us after a very late night arrival. I highly recommend this place. I've stayed in many Airbnbs, and this one is definitely in the top 5%!"

They have everything that you could ask for in their kitchen and more. It was very cold and snowy while I was there and there was an extra blanket to curl up with in the closet. Details are well thought out! It would be helpful to note that there is a family with young children that lives directly below this apartment.

Stayed a few nights","We stayed in Provo for three days for a Conference at Brigham Young University. Our stay was great and Christopher was impeccable. The place is EXTREMELY well-located, both to city center and the BYU campus. However, it is a little bit of an uphill battle to get to the north side of campus (where the Conference Center is). Nonetheless, we adjusted that by leaving a little earlier and having a ""freshening up"" session at the bathrooms, so we wouldn't present all sweaty. I wouldn't recommend this as ""walking distance"" to campus if you have a knee condition or something like that, because my calves were burning during all my stay from the journey to BYU. Nonetheless, we were the best located in regards to downtown, close to both shops and restaurants. There is a lot to do around the apartment and the zone felt very safe. There is a Seven-Eleven minutes away and a supermarket less than 10 minutes away. From one of the pictures, we assumed that there would be a futon AND a single person bed, and only when arriving, we realized it was the futon with a bedsheet. It was comfortable enough, but we wouldn't recommend more than one person sleeping on it. Also, having a washer and a drier made our life much much easier. Great apartment overall, would stay again."

The place is very homey and clean and well organized. Overall, the host is superb and the place is cool! I will definitely recommend this place to others and will definitely go back."

Stayed a few nights","Very close to BYU campus. Was perfect for education week. They do have some odd fees. The check out is at 10 am but if you don't text them they charge you per hour. The check in is after 4pm, which is 2-3 hours later than other places and if you want to come early they charge you 25 dollars. Seems to me they have either had some bad experiences or are looking for ways to get extra money. The building is shared with other units, so when you get to the front door, ignore the door on the right and go through the door directly across from the street and up the stairs, the apartment will be on your left at the top of the stairs. The space was put together well, sheets were good quality and comfortable on the king bed. Couch not so comfortable. No laundry detergent on site, so if you plan on doing laundry bring your own. Communication was top notch."

Stayed with kids","You will not believe how beautiful this location is. Peaceful and quiet, it really is a Zen retreat. Right next to BYU walking distance from downtown Provo. We got some ice cream and walked around the temple with my three kids. We had an amazing night. Helpful to have YouTube TV my kids were entertained by the selections there while My wife and I were able to talk in the kitchen. So nice being able to section the space in half with that door so we could still get some work done in the kitchen while the kids were sleeping. I also really liked the updated stainless steel appliances. Sparkling clean and I love the little details of the Jade knobs. Very tastefully presented bathroom with extra towels and helpful to have a designated parking spot. Amazing place and highly recommend to anyone needing a place for three adults or two adults and three young kids like us. We will be back. Chris was a delight and very responsive. Worked through every question we had with patience and resolved all of our concerns before we even had them with his communication. A Superhost in the making. Also so nice to have a desk to work at that had extra outlets for all the crazy electronics my kids have iPads and computers all were able to charge because they thought of every detail. Thank You!!! 6/5 Stars"

The shower was great, beautiful big windows. The bed is memory foam which isn’t our favorite, but it was fine. The only issue we had was with the tv. Couldn’t watch netflicks like we thought we could. We tried to cast our own netflicks account but that didn’t work. No big deal, we didn’t have time to watch too much tv anyway. We will stay here again for sure!"

Everything was very quiet and peaceful. We loved the amazing water pressure while taking a shower and the comfortable bed after a long day of work. I loved that we didn't have to use our own streaming accounts like most airbnb's.

We loved the tall windows, great natural light, thoughtful touches like the bedroom's black-out blinds, faux plants that created a homey vibe, and even a few cooking ingredients.

Great location in the beautiful historic district of Provo -- walkable to restaurants, coffee shops, and ice cream shop. It is a 100 year old church, so just keep in mind that it smells like a 100 year old church, especially in the winter time when the windows have been closed. If you are sensitive to smells, the building directly behind the church (on the same property) is newer and I believe those apartments don't have the same smell. Great water pressure and plentiful hot water. Todd is a very responsive host."

So I know the level of professionalism, cleanliness, and rental hospitality I'm getting with renting another of their units. And this stay did not disappoint in any way. Everything was exactly as I expected it to be. In my last Airbnb stay the only constructive criticism I gave was that the hot water didn't seem to last long. I have no problems this time. There was more than plenty. I'm absolutely satisfied in my stays with Todd. And it's likely that I will return in the future and rent from him again."

Stayed one night","I like to find unusual places to stay where we can cook dinner while on road trips. This apartment is one of nine in an interesting repurposing of a decommissioned church. Nicely done throughout, with a well-equipped kitchen. We planned to roast a chicken and make some side dishes for a full meal. Only problem: there was no baking dish or roasting pan. I called Todd and asked if he was close enough to the apartment to loan us something. He was actually out of town for the evening, but said, ""Just walk over to the big food store across the street and buy a baking dish, send me a photo of the receipt, and I'll reimburse you."" So I did just that. We cooked a lovely meal, and now the apt has a Pyrex baking dish.
That's what I'd call a responsive, solution-oriented AirB&B owner."

The bed is on the firm side, and is quite low to the ground, in case you have that preference. Street parking is super easy, fantastic location as well. I also loved the door knobs with codes- hate having to remember a key. It's also pretty quiet, barely heard anything or anyone."

Stayed about a week","An amazing apartment within a renovated old church that has long term apartment renters. You hear some footsteps of others and the floor squeaks in places but only reminds one of this great renovation project. Great set of amenities with high end full-size appliances including washer and dryer. One of the best places I've stayed. I wish there were dark out drapes although I loved the large original windows and light window shades in general. For any that have mobility or arthritic issues, the bed is lower but comfortable. There are steps (9 I think?) inside the building to the door; the few to the outside door are small. Security is great with exterior door to building and to apartment with touch pad locks. There is construction of a new apartment building right outside but they don't make much noise before 8 am and are gone by 5pm and weekdays only."

Apt was immaculate and well decorated. 0.4 miles from the Provo Rec center so it was an easy walk to work out or in the other direction to town. Provo Rec center is beautiful and a $5 day pass. Highly recommend!

Stayed a few nights","The good:
Great with communication through text or phone.
High ceiling (for this luxury unit)
The bad:
Inaccurate information;
1) pets hair all over the couch
2) not real fireplace (fire looking screen) *this is for other unit, which I had to movie 2 times.
3) If you don’t reply to Todd’s text, he might cancel your reservation and leave your belongings outside the doorway. (Changed the door lock code) since I was here for leisure, I don’t check my phone often. But that’s not an acceptable for him! So make sure before.
*still didn’t get reimbursed for fresh blueberries and unopened ice cream that I was locked out of door since Todd, changed the lock and left a minute before me arriving. (Says he has to attend his Christmas dinner)
***review other properties by Todd BEFORE booking. Has several other properties"

We took a stroll thru center street and visited all the temples. We got to make home cooked meals. We had everything we needed to be comfortable and relaxed. It was a much needed peaceful stay.

Stayed a few nights","I didn't want to leave! This by far is the best Airbnb experience I have had, in every way!
When you first arrive you see a beautiful historic chapel. Beautiful large windows, red brick and green grass.
The security of exterior and interior lock pads are easy to use with your individual code. Making check-in a breeze.
When you walk in the apartment you smell clean fresh air and see sparkling clean interior. Beautiful granite countertops and amazing appliances in the kitchen. Everything you need, including a Keurig with coffee pods and snacks! A large TV in living room with Netflix & more. The furnishings are tasteful, comfortable and cozy. There's a very clean washer & dryer with name brand detergent,(same brand I use at home) & fabric softener! The bathroom is large, clean, sparkling tub with very nice, soft towels. The hosts are so thoughtful they even supply make-up remover face cleaning cloths (the same brand I use at home!) The shower & tub is stocked with large bottles of shampoo, condition & body wash (each the same kind I use at home!). Then step into the bedroom, beautiful white comforter, very comfy pillows, and a bed I sleep better in than the one I had at home! They even provide a snuggly white robe!
I loved the charm, and thoughtfulness of the hosts. To many thoughtful touches to list! Best stay ever!"

Plus we have kids so we probably bothered the downstairs tenant more than he bothered us!

I was a little confused thinking the home was attached to another larger home, but this listing is for the actual house. The listing says “upstairs” so that had me thinking it was a second story apartment. There are renters below in the basement, which didn’t bother us at all. So, you are to enter the main entrance for this listing. The place was just right for us! Thanks!"

Stayed a few nights",This place was cute and clean and had easy access to the east end of Provo which was really great for us. The neighborhood seemed safe and we didn't have any problems. It was nice to be able to park in the driveway. Nathan communicated with us for any questions or issues we had. He put our name on a little sign in the kitchen as a welcome. That was delightful.

Stayed with kids",Nathan was quick to respond when I contacted him and I really appreciated his friendly messages. The home has everything we needed and felt clean and light. The beds were particularly comfortable—-I got some of the best sleep I’ve had in a long time. I’d stay here again and wish I could have been here longer . Thanks Nathan!

Stayed over a week","This is a great house in a very good location with quick access to BYU, and downtown. It’s a very cozy home with a great electric fireplace that is super easy to use with a remote control. The house has been completely redone so everything was new and clean. The hosts made sure we had what we needed but also gave us plenty of privacy. I would definitely stay at this house again. We enjoyed our stay very much."

There were drinks in the fridge and extra hygenie supplies. We loved the old house charm with the modern fireplace, tv, and appliances. The washer and dryer were a great bonus. Would love to stay there again!"
