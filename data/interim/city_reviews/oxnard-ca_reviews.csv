Stayed one night","Jill’s place was clean and cozy, with all the goodies that make a stay welcoming. Comfy bed and linens, coffee/tea maker, microwave, toaster and plenty of treats to snack on. Great location in a quiet neighborhood about a block from the beach. Plenty to enjoy nearby! Thank you, Jill."

Stayed one night","I loved The Studio by the Beach so much during my first visit that I chose it again for my second stay in the area just two weeks later (see previous review April, 2024). Quiet, calm, and relaxing. This place is so perfect and loaded with amenities that make your stay even more easy and enjoyable. Jill is a gracious host who goes the extra mile for her guests. Don't miss this location!"

Stayed with a pet","Jill has created a little slice of heaven at The Studio by the Beach, and Jill is a Superhost for a reason - actually, many reasons! The space itself is finely appointed, cozy, and charming; there is no amenity or extra little detail that Jill hasn't thoughtfully considered for your stay. The Studio exceeded the pictures and descriptions. Quiet, comfortable, and just a stroll away from the beach. Jill makes your check in/out process seamless, and she is flexible and accommodating from start to finish. Don't miss this outstanding location."

Stayed a few nights","Jill's place is a private apartment in her home, with a private door in a gated area. Even though her beach neighborhood has many houses, once inside Jill's gate, her lovely room and bath was peaceful, quiet, welcoming, and charming. We took a wonderful, very long walk on the beach, and good restaurants with ocean views were within easy driving distance. Jill was a wonderful and responsive host, and we highly recommend her place!"

Spotless, comfortable, and a great use of space, with Oxnard’s large sandy beaches just a 5-minute walk away. And Jill is a great host to boot. Good luck finding better bang for your buck than this in a SoCal beach community."

Stayed a few nights","⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
This is easily one of the best AirBNB experiences I’ve had, definitely the best in recent memory. The listing was exactly as described and pictured. Check in/out was painless using the concise instructions provided by Jill. The attractions blog that she shares was a great touch and helped me get to know the surrounding community and food options.
The room was absolutely spotless (with a completely reasonable cleaning fee unlike other listings) and was decorated quite nicely. Jill even had a customized sign with my name welcoming me, a truly thoughtful touch that made me feel right at home.
Most strikingly, and I want to emphasis this, I have not a stayed at an AirBNB with better amenities. Jill has thought of everything for this guest suite. A Keurig with all the fixings, a toaster oven, microwave, flatware, condiments, everything. She even has any and all toiletries you might need for your stay. You could show up with just a toothbrush and a change of clothes and be set!"

Stayed a few nights","We had a wonderful stay at Jill's place. Jill was friendly and responded quickly to messages. She provided an extra mattress and sleeping bag upon request. Even though the room is part of Jill's house, it is totally private with a separate entrance and enclosed with it's own fence. We could hear some footsteps and the dog faintly, but it was not bothersome or loud. The place was squeaky clean and the bed was super comfortable with 6 big pillows. We enjoyed exploring the place by opening drawers and the closet to find the many surprises left for us by Jill, including assorted toiletries, guidebooks, flashlights and chargers, games (chess, Phase 10, Scrabble, cards), lots of bath and beach towels, drying rack, etc. Jill made great use of the small space and with some planning as to where to place our stuff, we did not feel cramped at all. The TV worked great and the lights were adjustable. The property is located on a peaceful block about a 5 minute walk from beach. Thanks, Jill!"

Thank you for offering all the skin and body care; the beach chairs/bags/towels were used and appreciated! The unit is so close to the beach that we could even hear the seals barking faintly when the door was open. It was a wonderful stay. I would love to come back to Oxnard and stay at Jill’s again."

Stayed a few nights",I loved Jill’s place! I’m worried to write too good of a review since I will definitely be coming back and I don’t want it to be booked! Everything is as described. The bed and bedding was really comfortable and cozy. The bathroom has great counter space and the shower has great water pressure. I drink tea so I loved it has an electric hot water kettle not just a coffee machine. The water was filled upon my arrival and extra gallon bottled water provided. Not to mention everything you could need or want in a kitchenette. The area is quiet and I felt safe staying here. It was really helpful to be able to park in the driveway as well. Jill was so friendly and responsive with messages. Such a good and stress free experience all around.

Stayed a few nights","Jill’s well-stocked studio is the perfect retreat after sightseeing in Ojai, Ventura, and Oxnard. After each night in the comfy bed with reading lights, I enjoyed morning oatmeal and tea with agave sweetener while perusing Jill’s collection of local information. The refillable bathroom dispensers, which haven’t caught on back East yet, are kinder to the planet than tiny plastic shampoos. In the morning, I ventured down the street, stopping to revel in the scent of jasmine by the driveway. I met many friendly neighbors while birding near the harbor. (I found willets, Surf Scoters, and Western Grebes.) Another time, I hope to sample a drop-in yoga class nearby."

She was responsive and everything was so clean. She had chairs which we almost used to hang at the beach as well as yoga mats and awesomely there is a yoga studio Down her street. She had a welcome note that said my name and a guide book that had menus and recommendations. I would certainly visit again as it was a perfect spot."

Stayed a few nights","On a 1-5 star rating, where 1 is poor and 5 is great, I’d give Jill’s place a 7. I’d rate it higher only if it was a 1 bedroom apartment instead of a studio. The amenities she provided such as water, snacks, coffee pods, and all of the soaps and lotions were top notch. Then she has wires to charge for all types of phones. (I didn’t need to bring 6-7 charging wires.) Network tv is available as well as Netflix and other viewing services.
The place was perfect for us and we didn’t feel cramped. It was the best AirBnB we’ve ever stayed at - and we’ve stayed at many where we spent a lot of money and felt dissatisfied.
Jill had great recommendations for dining and was very responsive and friendly in all her communications with us.
Perfect place to stay. You won’t regret it."

Stayed one night","Jill’s place was wonderful — it was so comfortable for 1-2 people, and it had everything I needed and then some! The bed was amazing — and maybe this is a small thing for other people, but the shower products were lovely, too (I looked up the body wash so I could buy it myself 😍). The neighborhood was adorable, right by the beach, and I felt incredibly safe and comfortable as a young woman traveling alone! Thanks, Jill!"

Stayed one night","We completely enjoyed our lovely stay at Jill's. Everything was extremely clean but what's more, Jill's extra attention to making guests feel welcome shines through. Comfy bed, lovely linens, excellent coffee (!!!), and toiletries with unique scents all from a wonderful local refill store. Quiet and dreamy, just right. Although there is not a major kitchen, there were dining ware and pretty glasses to enjoy our meals in style, and a dish rack with soap. There were so many extra things to use in the cupboards that I honestly felt at home! Excellent hospitality, what a nice place! Would come back in a heartbeat!"

Stayed a few nights","This was an amazing location and I will definitely want to come back! Jill was extremely nice and helpful. She has a booklet on all the things you can do and eat nearby. The beach was only a 2-3 minutes walking distance and the sunsets were amazing!
The room was well prepared and had anything anyone would want for a beach trip. There was a beach umbrella, beach chairs, mats, and drying racks. She has local soaps and cleansers for sand, tar, and even sunburns etc.
What made her place stand out was the care she put into it. When my bestie and I arrived, we found an adorable board welcoming us. (It was so cute! We took pictures with it!)
We could see how much effort she put into making the room cozy and comfortable. It really made our trip unforgettable. I really can’t recommend Jill’s place enough and I will be telling my friends about it. I hope I can visit again! <3 Thank you!"

Not only is this place perfectly kept and full of everything we needed but it’s located in an amazing part of Oxnard. It was exactly how it was described and we are already talking about when to go back. I highly recommend.

The space is well laid out and has everything one would need for a cozy stay by the beach. I mean everything… Jill has chairs, towels, umbrellas, and everything else needed to make a stay near the beach easy and convenient.
And don’t get me started on the location! Beautiful, quiet, and a minute walk to the waters edge, the location couldn’t be better!
Don’t sleep on this unit, it’s a beauty."

My flight was canceled & his arrived on time. I messaged Jill to let her know & not only did she respond quickly, she also kept an eye out for him & gave me her cell to give to him in case he had questions. The space is small and amazingly comfortable & functional. We commented several times how well the space is set up & how much is available inside. It’s a queen bed, but a big queen. We are used to a king and had no issues with space. Loved all the little things that made this place great from welcome sign, the jar of jelly belly’s, hot water kettle, to the products in the bathroom & the to go coffee cups! Loved it all! I would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed one night","Jill was communicative with me when planning our stay to have my birthday celebration weekend. Easy to find, easy instructions to get in, comfortable bed, and a awesome shower head. She had all the bath amenities in case you forgot those. I wish there was 1 black hand towel to use for my make up brushes… I did NOT want to ruin her white ones. Jill had a board wishing me Happy Birthday along with a delicious cupcake and candle. My only two suggestions would be a wall AC because some people just run hot like me and I could only sleep with a sheet, but wished it was colder in the studio and the second one is upgrade to a oval higher toilet .. one there is low and my hubby and I kind of “dropped” because it is MUCH lower than we are used to. The place is next to the marina and beach; you can hear the seals barking. Very quiet and peaceful. Overall it was perfect for a 1 night stay. Thank you Jill."

Stayed with a pet","Jill and her studio apartment deserve nothing short of an absolutely glowing review. You really don’t need to keep looking- just book here 😉
Everything in the listing is spot on. The highlights for us included that it is just a few minutes walk from the beach, the check-in/out was seamlessly easy, and the apartment felt like a sweet little oasis -private, gorgeous, thoughtful.
Jill has thought of everything you might need and plenty of little extras I couldn’t have thought to ask for from understated decorations (and instructions/labels) to amnesties perfectly suited to stay in for some rest or head out to the beach or dinner - truly one the sweetest airbnbs I’ve stayed in!
I hope we get a chance to stay here again soon and I’ve already sent the listing to friends and family just in case they visit the area 💕
P.s. I loved all the eco-friendly choices too!"

She fit a ton of amenities in a studio but also kept it free from clutter by keeping it hidden in the cabinet next to the bed. Also loved the refill environmental friendly bathroom accommodations. Wish we had made use of the beach towels and chairs because the weather was chilly! Would come back again and recommend to others.

This is by far, one of the very best Airbnb homes that I have ever enjoyed. Instructions were perfect. I also loved the refill soaps in the bathroom in the glass dispensers — nice to know a kindred Earth-lover. Perfect location, very close to the beach. Had a wonderful time. My dog Happy clearly had an enjoyable time as well. Thank you for all of the extra effort—bells and whistles. Highly organized, tidy , and spick-and-span clean. One of my favorite Airbnb experiences of all time. Thank you, Jill!"

Stayed one night",stayed here two times so far and will continue to stay here when my boyfriend comes into town and we need to get away. Perfect location next to Silverstrand beach and near channel Islands Harbor with lots of fun restaurants. Had an amazing time the place was perfect for a little romantic getaway. The place is a little bit dated but super clean and comfortable.

Stayed with a pet","First off, I loved how close this was to the ocean! We took multiple walks to the beach in the 16 hours we were here.
Jill is so dog friendly! I checked ahead of time to ask if she needed extra to have our pup stay there and they don’t, which was amazing, since it’s usually a lot extra! In her guestbook, she even mentioned that it was okay for dogs to be on the bed, as long as you put a sheet over the duvet, which I thought was really cool! We did have to take our dog on a bit of a walk to potty him, but we didn’t mind! The neighborhood was quiet and calm.
Her place was so clean and she had thought of so much! There were multiple fans, a whole coffee and tea station, chargers and power strips EVERYWHERE, games, beach towels and more!
The water pressure in the shower was fantastic!
The only thing I would say is the backyard isn’t really a backyard. There is a little bit of space, but not a ton of room to hang out, so I wouldn’t necessarily bank on hanging out back there for hours!
Overall, I would TOTALLY stay here again! Loved it!"

The unit itself had everything we needed and was beautifully decorated. The outdoor space out back had wonderful touches with hanging chairs and board games made for the outdoors. Jill was quick to respond and even suggested her drying rack for my friend’s wet suit. We’d love to go back for another visit!"

I'm originally from California and silverstrand Beach was my spot. It's small and laid back, to this day. nothing really changed, other then it's extremely expensive for everything, just be prepared for that. Especially food. This house is great for that. My family of 5 did 7 nights here. The deck is amazing, and the kitchen is great. Purchase the extras and go out on a kyak and paddle boards.
Thanks for the great stay!"

Stayed with kids","We had a great time staying at this home on the marina. It was extremely clean and well equipped, having everything you could need. We were excited about being so close to the beach, but to be honest…the closest beach is not the best (a little disappointing). We ended up driving to Santa Monica for a better beach. However, we loved sitting on the deck every morning…there is a lot of activity to keep you entertained while drinking coffee. Next time we’ll come in the winter when beach time isn’t as important to us.
Our host was wonderful, great communication and was very quick to respond when I had a question.
We enjoyed some great restaurants in the area. We went to Six Flags Magic Mountain. The drive from the house to Venice beach, along the coast, is fun and beautiful. So much to do and see within an hour drive, we’ll definitely return to take in even more."

The location is great - a very quiet, upscale neighbourhood with direct access to the water via the private jetty and we made good use of the kayaks and stand up paddle boards to explore the extensive canal network.
Communication with Bobbi was good and she was very quick at sorting out a couple of issues like missing bath plugs.
The house was ideal for us as a couple with plenty of room for when our family visited at the weekend from LA (just an hour away). A short walk to the huge beach and the harbour with its eateries, its also only a short drive to the supermarket etc."

Our favorite beach was Oxnard State Beach. Bobbi was so responsive to my questions and made this trip wonderful. Very considerate and even was allowed to use the SUP boards and kayaks for free when an issue arose. Fishing rod, life jackets, and family-friendly games are provided. There is only one TV in the home, which honestly was fantastic, and since it made my three teens boys and elder mother spend more time together, ha ha ha. The home is in the perfect location since you can see the mountains from the deck and see a breathtaking sunrise and sunset."

We had 3 children with us so that was impossible. I also was not happy with their being only one television in the whole house. There was construction going on at the house next door which made for it being pretty noisy. They also blocked the drive several times due to that.

Stayed with kids","We had a great time at Bobbi and Jose's beautiful house and enjoyed its amazing location on the water. Bobbi was very responsive and communicative. The quiet, protected waters of the canal were perfect for swimming, paddle boarding, kayaking and relaxing on the deck. We loved watching the seabirds and sunset, feeling the ocean breezes and hearing the waves and sea lions in the distance. A gorgeous sandy beach was a short 10-15 minute walk away with lots of space to walk, run, play in the waves and hang out.
The house is very spacious and clean with an open floor plan and lots of natural light and windows for fresh ocean air flow. Our family hung out together in the open living/dining/deck area while also having lots of quiet private space to ourselves in the bedrooms. The kids room has 4 bed options and lots of games to explore, perfect for our curious 9 year old. We had everything we needed to cook and reheat all our meals. If we had more time, we would've loved to use the grill on the deck. The outdoor hoses, shower and laundry machines were perfect for cleaning up after our Channel Island, beach and canal adventures.
We went on an awesome day trip to Santa Cruz Island. The Island Packers boats that go to the islands or go on wildlife cruises either leave from Ventura Harbor, which is an easy 10-minute drive away (where we went), or the Oxnard/Channel Islands Harbor, which is very close to the house - you can walk there in about 10-15 minutes.
On the other days we walked 10 minutes to the spacious Oxnard and Hollywood beaches via a protected crosswalk/light and lovely landscaped walkway. You can see the Channel Islands and lots of sea birds from these beaches. There is a detailed guidebook and instructions with a lot more info in the house.
Overall, this was an awesome stay for our family in this beautiful house and relaxed, quiet, gorgeous natural setting with responsive hosts and lots of options for fun outdoor adventures. Thanks so much, Bobbi and Jose!"

The home was clean, well equipped, and relaxing on the deck with water views was very peaceful. Definitely take advantage of the kayaks and stand up paddle boards which can be launched directly from the dock. The home is well situated for a variety of day trips. We went surfing at Mondo’s beach just north of Ventura, horse back riding in Ojai, and toured a Hollywood studio in LA. The neighborhood is quiet, the beds are comfortable, and a beautiful beach is only a short walk away. I highly recommend this home for a stay in the Oxnard/Ventura area."

It’s so beautiful to sit out there, there’s a bbq, an awesome hammock type chair, tables and plenty of seats. The rooms were clean and plenty of places for people to sleep. We chose to include the stand up paddle boards and the kayaks during our stay and I HIGHLY recommend them! Our whole family spent an entire day switching off between them and made such great memories. There were plenty of board games for the kids to pick from and we had a blast.

Stayed over a week","The place is clean, bright, airy, spacious, with high ceilings and lots of natural light. There are sufficient furnishings in each room without being crowded with with too much furniture, so you can move around easily. Artwork and color scheme are subdued and beach-themed. Recent paint throughout. Furnishings and window coverings were all in good repair, nothing broken and no torn screens. Nice plank flooring throughout. Very well kept up.
Both bathrooms were very clean and appear to have been updated recently. Kitchen had plenty of silverware and plates, glasses, and mugs. Kitchen was also stocked with coffee, sugar, creamer, and other foodstuffs for use. A new-looking Weber BBQ was included outside on the deck. Nice large dining table with 6 chairs.
The master bedroom was very spacious, with an entire wall of mirrored closets for clothing and whatever else you wanted to stash away. A very comfy queen bed. As an older person, I appreciated the bright overhead light in the sink area so I could see well.
I also made use of the gas fireplace on chilly mornings and evenings. The TV is large with good wifi. There are expansive views from the lovely deck, which is well-furnished with attractive patio furniture. You can see mountains and lots of water views, plus the action of boaters and kayakers and birds. The deck is surrounded with glass panels instead of wood rails, to allow for great views even when sitting down. I saw a dolphin come by one evening! Neighbors on both side are nice, and are only there part time. An added attraction was the use of the 2 kayaks. (There are also 2 stand-up paddleboards, but I didn't use them.) It was so great to just walk down the ramp to the dock and launch the kayak. Easy breezy!
This home is at the end of a cul-de-sac, and the whole neighborhood is a series of cul-de-sacs, so it is very quiet. The home also has dual-pane glass sliders, which effectively keeps outside noise to a bare minimum.
The owners were very responsive to my questions and in taking care of my requests. Overall, I couldn't have asked for a better place to spend nearly 2 months! Highly recommend."

Very comfortable kayaks and there is a ladder on the dock to help get out of the kayaks and back up onto the dock. It was also easy to put the kayaks in and out of the water after each use. We brought our own life jackets, but there are life jackets available if you do the kayak package. The home was sparkly clean when we walked in and the hosts are very responsive and friendly. The house is in a great location. Nice walking trail nearby and beach is an easy walk too. Loved sitting on the deck and really enjoyed the hammock swing.

Stayed with kids","I’m going to start by saying beautiful property, well kept up, nicely decorated, very clean and nice feel.
The overall location: it is great! Close to a Ralph’s and Vons and near parks, beach and water front. Lots of activities nearby! It’s located at the end of a street as well so our kids played soccer in the street at the dead end with parent supervision and it worked great!
Kitchen: it has the bare essentials. A good supply of plates, bowls, glasses and utensils. They also have a dishwasher. If you’re a real cook and want to cook in the home though you’ll likely need to bring some of your own supplies. For example there were zero mixing bowls, serving bowls, platters nor cookie sheet pans for baking.
Outside space: right on the canal with direct water access, comfortable seating on deck, grill (we did not use), good size deck. We are outside for dinner every night, it was beautiful and no flies (lots during the day) by evening.
The beds and baths: relatively comfortable for 2-3 nights, but wouldn’t be long-term. Kids bedroom which sleeps 5 was spacious and nice with 5 board games. Bedrooms have lots of closet spaces and plenty of hangers (often lacking in most Airbnb’s). Two bathrooms and a separate sink area in master which is nice! All bathrooms included plenty of hand soap, shampoo, body wash and conditioner, very nice!
There’s a laundry washer and dryer too! With detergent available, very nice!
To note: Checkout requirements of guest to do is more demanding then I’ve been asked at any property stays.
We take 10+ vacations a year and over the last 4 years almost exclusively stay in Airbnb’s and we are very picky when selecting a place because of having so much experience. Overall it was a relaxing stay and enjoyable at this property and I would likely recommend this place to others!"

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I have stayed in several Airbnb's across the country, and this one is near the top of our list. We've already made plans to go back again! The house is great: a big, clean space with beautiful views of the canal. And speaking of the canal.....kayaking was SO fun! It was very easy for us to launch and use the kayaks right off the dock. We loved it so much we did it twice! One of the coolest things we've ever experienced. Our dogs LOVED sunbathing on the deck every day, and watching boats, paddle boarders and kayakers cruise by. Can't say enough nice things about our stay. We'll definitely be back."

It is in a perfect location so that you can easily access the water, walk to the beach, and get to local stores. The hosts were also great with communication and were quick to respond to any questions we had throughout our stay. It was a very relaxing stay and we can not wait to go back! Thank you Bobbi and Jose for allowing the opportunity to stay in your home!!"

Went with a family of 7 and we all enjoyed ourselves. She’s been extra thoughtful about what she has available to guests. My family literally overpacked because we weren’t sure what we’d have as far as cooking utensils, cleaning supplies and the like. When we got there we were shocked (in a good way!) that the house was ready for anything. We’re hoping to visit again sometime this year 👌🏼👌🏼🙏🏻🙏🏻"

It is immaculate and tastefully decorated inside, and the rear deck is a delight. The kayaks were a awesome addition--perfect for the calm waters in the canals. The location is unbeatable--a 10 minute walk to a lovely beach, close to multiple dining options--most of which do COVID-safe pickup or delivery. On the eastern end of the canals there are beautiful walking paths. Communication with Bobbi and Jose was perfect. All in all a wonderful experience, and highly recommended!"

Stayed with kids",We had such a great stay! The location on the harbor is very unique. We drank coffee and watched a boat or two go by each morning. One evening a decorated paddle wheel went by down the channel. The house is close to beaches and Ventura Harbor. Ventura Harbor has ferries to the Cannel Islands and we rented a small electric harbor boat for an hour and a half and traveled throughout the harbor. Bring lunch with you if you rent a boat because they have a small table down the center and it’s a nice way to spend the afternoon. Our goal was to get away and relax in a unique place and Bobbi’s house fit the bill!

I rented this place to prepare for my wedding day with my girls, and also spend my wedding night. Bobbi was so great and allowed more guests (makeup and hair artists). So perfect! And so great for photos.
Also, it was very quiet and peaceful.
I cannot wait to stay here again and I definitely will be doing so soon."

This made it for a somewhat difficult night of sleep, as one of the parties was making noise. One bathroom is shared between two of the rooms, and the third room has its own bathroom. Check-in was easy, the kitchen was open for us to use. Overall, very much worth the value and I recommend this place as long as you’re comfortable with sharing a house."

Stayed one night","Bedroom #1 at Olga's place was perfect for my overnight stay. The kitchen has everything one could wish for, including a blender for my morning smoothie. Even though the listing doesn't state AC there is a portable AC in the room that worked great to keep the room cool for sleeping and to mask the sounds of people talking in the living room and outside. This was my first time sharing a house with strangers yet I felt very secure given the personal locks on doors, the automatic lighting upon exiting a room, and the cameras. The room is not big but is perfect for a good night's sleep. One needs to be agile to climb up onto the bed, but hey, it was very comfortable! I guarantee this is somewhere I will stay again if I find myself needing to spend the night in the Ventura area. Olga is very responsive and her other guests were very respectful of personal space"

Stayed one night","This is a boarding house where several bedrooms are rented out to different parties, but very quiet and private. Touchpad lock at front door and a key for each room so it's secure. Comfy queen bed takes up most of Room #1 but fine for a quick place to sleep so didn't need other furniture. Just a light blanket and bedspread on a chilly night and had to wear a sweatshirt to bed as I'm used to sleeping under a comforter. Shared bathroom has a door that doesn't sit tightly so a very narrow open slit between door and jam, but zero traffic in the hall.
Living room with big screen TV, nice kitchen, laundry and cute sitting area all very clean and well lit. Neighborhood is quiet for a good night's sleep. Olga responds quickly; kindly allowed me early check-in which was good because access information sent after booking listed a different front door code than what she messaged to me. Would have been a problem at 11:00pm if I hadn't found out earlier. Overall comfortable, safe, a great value."

Stayed one night","Small room with huge bed, the mattress(s) was so high, it went to my belly button and I needed a stool to get up there. In addition to the bed, there was unfortunately no bedside lamp and the light switch was next to the door. The room is very noisy and since there are a total of 5 Airbnb rooms, you can have very bad luck with the ""neighbors"", just like me. The one couple started cooking loudly in the kitchen shortly before 10 o'clock in the evening, when I wrote Olga, but she responded directly, which I found very good. However, what I did not like was that I booked the accommodation extra because there is a washing machine with me and then it was written at check-in that it is only for guests from 3 nights or more. In addition, the house is not exactly in the best area.
Therefore, unfortunately, I would not come again in summary, although Olga seems to be a nice host."

Only disadvantage was that it is a little bit poor soundproofed. Our room (#1) is directly next to the house entrance door and you hear the „beeps“ every time someone comes in the house.
But this was just a tiny problem!

Stayed with kids",Place was awesome. Our party of 10 did new years countdown here and it was 1 min walk to beach.. kids loved digging in the sand. Numerous bikes on site for diff heights and ages. One of my daughters couldn’t bike yet and there was a scooter there too. Super easy to bike to the marina. Could try and spot sea lions! Lots of restaurants nearby too if you wanted to Uber eat or DoorDash. Highly recommend this place. You won’t regret it! Lots of space to gather and hang out but also your own private areas to chill away from family when needed.

Stayed with kids","The perfect place for a large group or family!
Host: Zalman was an amazing and thoughtful host! He was super responsive and a great communicator to all our questions and we had many! He even went out of his way to provide us an order of treats (cake, fruit, and ice cream) when we requested for paper towels.
Location: The location and amenities were perfect for our family trip. The location was walkable to the beach and to the harbor. The harbor was a good spot for walking, bike riding, and seal spotting.
House: We had all the entertainment and comforts to meet the needs of all family members (all ages). The rooms were all nicely designed and clean. The kitchen had all the equipment needed for cooking. The living room was well stocked with games to keep the kiddos entertained. The garage had bikes and scooters for kids and adults which we got to use along the harbor and neighborhood.
Overall, highly recommend! 10/10!"

The kitchen had a large island where we could all help in the kitchen. The key was the rooftop that offered views of the beach and sunset.
There are bars, restaurants, and Jetski/boat rentals within walking distance.
I would not hesitate to stay here again in the future.

Stayed with kids","Like others I came to Zalman's beautiful home after a horrible experience at another property.
I found Zalman's listing at midnight when I was looking for options of what I could do to and he responded quickly to my inquiries
He allowed me to come check out his home first thing in the morning following my midnight inquiry.
I knew right away that the other property being a disaster was meant to be because we were meant to stay at Zalman's beautiful and amazing home.
It was absolutely amazing. Right across the street with beautiful ocean views. The home is so peaceful and serene.
This is our 2nd family summer/fall trip to Oxnard, and the 3rd home we've stayed in and we've already talked with Zalman about coming here next year.
He was very accommodating with allowing us to check in early. The elevator made the move so much more manageable. Both my 9 year old twin girls and my senior parents loved the elevator.
I just can't say enough wonderful things about Zalman's Beach home"

Not only that but this place is awesome, bikes, kid toys, cars and bikes, beach toys and gear, full cooking pots pans plates. Beds were comfy, big sofas, perfect place for a joint family getaway!"

Group trip","This was a great vacation place! We were on the rooftop patio for every sunset, and enjoyed our pizza dinner there on the first evening. The 360º view kept us entertained, with boats always in sight, and dolphins passing at one point. Some of us walked to the beach, others read on one of the three balconies or the rooftop chaise lounges. The college-age kids and the 8-year olds each found plenty of games to play each other, as did the adults.
The kitchen was well laid out and equipped so that many times there were 4 around the large island preparing and cooking meals, then the whole crowd going around the island, served buffet style. The adjoining large table worked great for feeding 10 at once, with more seats nearby and an ocean view. The elevator was a godsend for bringing food and drinks up to the kitchen and for two of us with medical handicaps. If there was anything we couldn’t find or figure out, Zalman got back to us very quickly with the answer."

Zalman's house was PRISTINE, absolutely beautifully decorating, had the BEST amenities for the beach and a fully stocked kitchen with the top of the line knives and appliances. The linens and towels were top notch and the house felt like it had been very well cared for, probably the best house we have stayed in over the past MANY years (we come up to Oxnard every year and rent for Spring Break). We will definitely be renting again from Zalman. He was responsive, kind, helpful and a fabulous host. Thank you so much!!!!!"

Stayed one night","WOW! First-class accommodation all the way! What an incredible location and the perfect home to gather for a relaxing family vacation. I live in LA and I had family and friends visiting from Vancouver, Denver, and Atlanta and this house was perfect for a family getaway. The home provided countless comforts (comfortable beds, high thread count sheets, bikes, WARM toilets, beach towels and toys, an elevator, and more). We took advantage of the chef’s kitchen which is a dream to cook in. The views are stunning and the sunlight is golden in the morning and evening. We enjoyed many family meals around the giant round table that fits 10 comfortably. The house is steps from the sand and its natural beach dunes blooming with wildflowers and beautiful driftwood and sand dollars to find made the days at the beach picture perfect. This was my first time to Hollywood Beach and Chanel Islands Harbor and I will definitely come back. This area is safe, clean, secluded, and just a short drive from LA."

Group trip","Best rental experience ever! Zalman was SUPER responsive any time I had a question before and during our visit. He clearly wanted our stay to be 5 star, and it was. The house is gorgeous, spotless, and absolutely in perfect working order. We didn't come across one thing that was in disrepair. That includes the 5 adult (and 2 kid) bicycles in the garage...and the beach chairs...and the high quality cornhole boards...and the surfboards and paddle board. Everything seemed new and worked perfectly. This house was great for the four families who shared it - teenagers took over the 6 beds in the bunk room, plus couches upstairs where they crashed each night after playing their video game system on the GIANT t.v. Will definitely be looking for a chance to come back. It was great!"

Stayed with kids","I can't say enough good things in this review. Our experience way exceeded my expectations. The beach house is incredible and Zalman is a wonderful and generous host. The house is amazing, and it is furnished like a personal vacation home with all the toys and supplies you would want for your own beach house.
First, the house itself is so spacious, everyone had enough space. We had 10 people from three families and three generations. The elevator was so helpful for my 90-year old mother. The rooftop deck is very special at any time of day. It is quite large and has views of the ocean and the harbor.
The kitchen appliances are high quality, and there are plenty of dishes and cookware, as well as paper goods. We used the Nespresso machines for morning coffee, with lots of different pods to choose from, and a milk frother! The large living area on the third floor was perfect for playing games, watching movies together, doing puzzles (a number of puzzles and games provided). We had so much fun.
The location is superb... we walked across the street for access to the beach. It's a perfect swimming beach because of the breakwater. One day we wanted more waves so drove down to the Oxnard State Beach (free parking in the lot or on the street!)
As people mention in their reviews, there are lots of kitchen, bath, and beach towels. The three pairs of washers and dryers sure came in handy to wash towels and wet clothes after playing at the beach.
We used many of the fun beach items like the surfboards, paddleboard, and beach chairs. So thoughtful to have these available, especially for out-of-town guests. In the garage there were other games and toys that we didn't even have time to get to like cornhole and foosball.
All in all, we had a marvelous beach vacation and look forward to coming back."

This was an incredible location, a short walk to the beach. They also supplied games, boogie boards, beach chairs and beach towels which made it so convenient. There is a little inlet just out from the beach and each morning we saw dolphins passing fairly close by, which made our stay even more special."

The house itself is kept in very good shape with a huge selection of beach needs ready to go in the garage (chairs, umbrellas, boogie boards, surf boards) plus bikes you can jump right on to and within 4 minutes your watching Sea Lions basking in the sun. There’s a corner store a few blocks away that never seemed to close for last minute needs and the best little intimate beach bar just a few houses walk away. The beds were comfortable, the kitchen had all the dish/ cooking utensils you’d need to make a meal and the ping pong table is a great source of entertainment on a wet beach day. I would definitely recommend this property for someone looking for a more secluded beach experience in Oxnard."

Stayed with kids","This house was exactly as advertised. Block from the beach and tucked away in the “Hollywoods” named after streets in LA. Quaint and private. The house was pristine and set up has everything you need. Bikes, fully equipped kitchen, bathrooms with amenities that make it feel like you are in a hotel. Sheets were clean and I could have stayed there for a few more days. They do a wonderful job of making you feel right at home."

Stayed with kids","Beautiful peaceful location a short walk to the silver strand. Spotless well-equipped house — ping pong, bikes, beach towels, kitchen essentials. Lovely roof deck though some indirect low level lighting might be nice for sitting out after dark (the deck light is BRIGHT). The heating system mostly powers the top floor, but we found brand-new super efficient space heaters in a downstairs closet for the lower level bedroom. Terrific communication (wrote to let us know it was ready early!). Thanks for a great trip!"

The home is clean, open and spacious, with modern beach themed decor and a cool roof deck. Everything was smooth and easy from checking in to finding towels, beach chairs, bikes and more. Beach is just a five minute walk to a clean, expansive beach with just a sprinkling of people…amazing! Lots of things to do here, we could have happily stayed longer."

Stayed a few nights","We had a wonderful stay and this place is great! Perfect location in Silver Strand in Oxnard, close to the beach, the sea lions, restaurants, groceries, and even a little electric boat we took out around the marina. We had everything we needed here and more, and the hosts were so accommodating and really went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. Layout is great, an en-suite bedroom on the first floor with a small living room attached and a converted garage with a ping pong table and a ton of beach supplies, bikes, chairs, umbrellas, and more, and the main floor had a master bed and bath, a 2nd bedroom with bunk beds plus a single which was great for the kids, and then a kitchen and family room where we spent most of our time in front of their amazing fireplace. We even grilled some steaks on their rooftop deck BBQ. Amazing time and look forward to coming back soon!"

Group trip","There’s no doubt that this gorgeous place is stylishly decorated, well-equipped, and in a fantastic location steps away from a quiet stretch of Silver Strand. Meredith was a kind, flexible, and responsive host. Check-in was a breeze. We did experience a few hiccups, such as one of the king-sized beds were were relying on for adults ended up being a pullout that was broken. Credit to Meredith for immediately trying to reach her handyman, but he was unavailable so we weren’t able to use that bed as intended. Luckily, the house was spacious enough to provide alternatives, including a rollaway mattress, but it took time away from our very short vacation to handle things.
The garage was impressively stocked with beach gear, and we enjoyed cooking in the lovely kitchen. Bluetooth speakers were a nice touch as well. And the rooftop deck was great! There was some MacGyver-ing involved, but overall, we enjoyed our time at Meredith’s beautiful beach house and would happily visit again."

Everyone in my family—from a small child to grandparents—raved about how clean, comfortable, and perfectly situated the house is. There’s a lot of space indoors and out, meaning lots of privacy and room to spread out. And there are fun activities for everyone, including ping pong and bicycles! It’s even located near the end of a pristine stretch of beach where there are far fewer beach goers than usual. Highly recommend!"

The location is fantastic - in our opinion on the more charming and private side of Oxnard’s beaches, and the access is immediate and feels private. Meredith and Michael give the term “superhosts” a whole new meaning! They are fantastic hosts, incredibly responsive and with an authentic, generous, and genuine sense of caring for their guests. We felt at home from the moment we walked in until the moment we left! If we could give a rating higher than five stars, we would..!"

The kitchen was well equipped and the pantry had everything we needed to prepare our meals. Plenty of linens and toiletries were provided including cotton swabs, make up remover pads, shampoo/conditioner and soap (I know this may not seem important but I’ve rented Airbnb’s that have limited supplies and it is frustrating). I love that the owners paid close attention to every detail in every room. Couches and beds were super comfortable, pillows were perfectly firm and linens were soft. The property both inside and out are meticulous. We enjoyed some time in the upstairs deck that was also well furnished. The owners were attentive and responded immediately to a few questions we had. Can’t wait to stay here again."

Stayed with kids","***Before you read this review, please note that this is written by a thirteen year old who wanted to give a kid's viewpoint on the house. We had six people stay in the house for 2 days. ***
First of all, the exterior of the house is not special because it blends in to the rest of the neighborhood. However, the inside is amazing. Everything matches nicely and there is a beach theme that is consistent throughout the house.
I think that the inside of the house is really clean and pretty. There are three bedrooms, with two master beds, one bunk bed, and one regular sized bed. There are three bathrooms, and there is a patio on the rooftop where you can comfortably watch the sunset. There is also a spacious garage that has spikeball, five bikes, beach chairs, an umbrella, a laundry machine, and more. The kitchen was well equipped with pots and pans, a microwave, an oven, silverware, a stovetop, lots of plates and dishes, wine glasses, a refrigerator, a freezer, and a pantry that has plenty of cooking ingredients.
The house is one block away from a really nice, empty beach. There are murals at the beach and there was plenty of room for us to play, and the ocean was beautiful, unlike some of the gray oceans that we saw in Santa Barbara.
The owners of the house are also really nice and thoughtful, because although we accidentally broke a lightbulb, they didn't seem mad at all and they didn't charge us for it. They also had made a binder full of activities and restaurants to go to, which saved us a lot of hassle.
All in all, I would rate this beach house five stars. It definitely exceeded my expectations with the clean rooms, the decor, the beach, and the thoughtfulness of the owners. I really encourage you to consider this house."

The rooftop loft was cool as it had a barbecue grill, table with chairs and a couple of lounge chairs and a small sofa.
One thing to get used to was like many beach properties where land is at a premium, houses are very close to each other and there isn’t a view.
We need to come back for longer than a weekend for sure!"

Stayed with kids","We loved our time in Silver Strand so much! This house was perfect for our family getaway. Super clean, super comfortable, and very relaxing. We had 4 adults and 4 kids, and we could have fit even more very comfortably (we didn't even use one of the beds in the bunk room or the pull out couch, and there were extra mattresses in the closet as well.]Speaking of the beds, they were the MOST COMFORTABLE and even better than my own bed. Needless to say, we didn't want to leave. The house is decorated so well, and there is so much natural light. Everything we needed was provided, and the garage is stocked with beach bikes, beach toys, towels, chairs, umbrella, etc. The tv's in all the gathering areas were super easy to use (all smart TVs and able to sign into Netflix/Disney etc. The kitchen had everything we needed and we cooked our own meals for about half the meals. The location was unbelievable, with the beach only 100 feet from the door, and even on a Saturday we had the beach nearly to ourselves. It was so easy to walk over to the beach for sunset, which was beautiful with the sun setting over the Channel Islands. All the neighbors are so nice and it felt like we were just part of the community. The street only has a little space for public parking, so most of the people on the beach are just the local residents. We wanted to rent a Duffy boat in the harbor and go for a ride, but we were too last minute and the available times didn't work for us, so I would recommend reserving a week ahead of time at least (there are 2-3 companies that rent in the harbor). Meredith accommodated a late checkout which made it so much easier to have a relaxing morning before packing up. Can't say enough good things about this place!! Can't wait to go back!"

Meredith was prompt in answering any questions and a super sweet hostess. The home is very well equipped with all the extra curricular add ins such as multiple surfboards, bicycles, towels, too many great and thoughtful amenities everywhere to list! House was sparkling clean, we did not lack for anything. Great little restaurants in the area accessible by foot or bikes.
If you choose this rental you will not be disappointed! Highly recommended. Thank you Meredith for opening your home to us. We WILL be back!
Cheers!

Stayed one night","Richard's place was perfect, just what we needed for our little getaway! As soon as we walked in we were impressed how clean, cozy, & surprised how much more spacious the place was than we expected. The ocean view from the bedroom was beautiful. The patio right outside was so peaceful & we loved that we were able to just walk out & take a stroll along the beach. The ammenities were also just right. Richard was great & communicated promptly/efficiently throughout the entire process from time of booking to check-in to check-out. Thank you so much Richard for providing us with such a great experience & for extending your generous hospitality! We will definitely be returning again in the near future."

We had a great stay and Richard was very helpful with things to do. We did find a great restaurant on our own, The Waterside in the Oxnard Harbor. We also went on a Whale Watch with Island Packers. It was an amazing trip. We saw Gray whales, Orca whales, and lots of dolphins and seals. The weather was very cooperative as we had sunny days but we still had on our jackets while watching kids romp in the waves in swimsuits! Everything was clean and comfortable!"

The bedroom opens onto an outdoor sitting and dining area overlooking the sand and Pacific Ocean. We watched the sun as it set over the water. The next day we watched the colors cross the morning sky as surfers headed across the sand. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom had everything we needed. We were happy to have a fridge to keep our drinks cold. My brother enjoyed TV before falling asleep. Parking is available for the unit and entry a breeze. Ricard was responsive to our request for dinner recommendations and we enjoyed his suggestion. We definitely recommend a stay here.

Only two cautions, if you cook come prepared, the work surface is limited and watch the shower it can be very hot. A truly lovely place."

We especially cherished having dinner and breakfast outside on the patio table, whilst being serenaded by the soothing crash of waves in the distance - beach flip flops thoughtfully provided! When it was time to come in, we would then curl up with the extensive library of reading material found in Richard & Juliette’s cute little book shelves, whilst relaxing to Celtic music - CD & player provided!

Stayed one night","Richard was a great host: generous, communicative, and amenable. He and his wife clearly care about their home and take seriously welcoming guests. I don’t have anything negative to say about Kevin as a host! I have already mentioned this spotless unit to friends.
Nothing beats falling asleep and waking up next to the ocean. In that sense, the rate was worth it — but I walked away thinking that maybe the room was not worth $230+ (after taxes and additional fees). It might be what the local average price is, but given the quiet, sleepy neighborhood and the long sand tube laid down the length of the beach instructing an ocean view, I feel it was an overpriced stay.
My two cents. Truly, Richard was lovely!"

Stayed one night","This place is amazing and beautiful. From the moment you walk inside, the decor just lifts your mood. It’s beautiful. You have a private patio, where you can open the slider door from your bedroom and enjoy your morning coffee or breakfast while soaking in the fresh air. Or if you want to walk along the sand to the water, you are able to do so from the patio. What’s also nice it has a parking space available. I also really appreciated the small little touches as well. For example, if you get tar on your feet, they have baby oil which made it easier to get off. Or if you to go the market, they have instructions on where to go and even have shopping bags to use them. If you want to go biking riding, they have bicycles to use if you choose. It was these touches, that make you feel welcomed. Also, the section of the beach doesn’t get too crowded which is nice. I highly recommend staying here and will do so again."

We especially appreciated the beach toys for our kid - she was thrilled to play with ""new"" stuff. As others have said, we didn't even need to unpack the beach items we brought in our car.

Stayed a few nights","My fiance (at the time of booking) rented this cozy little spot on the beach on the eve of our marriage ceremony elopement. We checked in late the Wednesday evening. Check in was super easy & fast. Instructions were very precise, direct & easy to follow. Everything was very clean & equipped with everything we could possibly need, although we had all our own supplies. The beach area was also clean & private. We felt very comfortable there. I was able to use Thursday morning (alone) to get dressed for our wedding ceremony which was only 10 minutes away. Everything worked out perfectly. I returned later that day with my new husband to a spectacular honeymoon evening! Although, we never got to personally meet Richard & Juliet, they were great host. They sent us a couple of encouraging messages, and gave us absolute privacy, even though they lived right upstairs. I believe when we 1st arrived, we heard voices once, then footsteps, which kinda made us a little leary but nothing else after that. Honestly, it wasn't a problem at all. We enjoyed our stay & look forward to staying again. We would definitely recommend to any of our family, friends, loved ones...or anyone wanting a nice cozy, private getaway on beach!"

There are plenty of things to do nearby; stores, restaurants, etc. There’s so much more to say, but I want to let everyone know that host Richard is genuine and just an overall good guy. He went above and beyond to make sure our visit was nothing short of spectacular. I feel like I owe him for the little things that he did for us that were completely unexpected. Things you’d only expect from a good friend. So, if you’re reading this, thank you Richard!

Stayed one night","Such a gorgeous spot! Right on the sand. You cannot beat the location! My husband loved his birthday surprise. He did accidentally try to get into the wrong door. Richard does give detailed instructions, but my husband didn't read the them since it was a surprise and didn't see the covered keypad on the correct door 😬. Ooops, I don't think Richard was too happy about the mishap 🙈. So reread the instructions, count the doors, and move the paper. The place is literally on the beach! Amazing views and luckily we had sunny weather. The only downside is that the place is attached to the main house- it is not it's ""own"". It's basically the downstairs of the house with a locked door next to the bedroom that leads to the upstairs. Although we couldn't hear anyone talking up stairs we could hear every footstep, cough/sneeze. We like a little more privacy. Everything else was great! We loved the fireplace in the bedroom. And the space was packed with anything and everything you could ever need. Definitely worth the one nighter."

The pictures don’t do the space justice (and I feel with my other Airbnb experiences it’s sometimes the opposite). Incredible host. We made half our meals in the well stocked kitchen and ordered the other half, lots of great delivery options nearby!"

The pictures simply do not do it justice.
You have to see the view from the bedroom to believe it. Open a sliding door and you are literally on the sand paces away from the water.
My wife and I slept with the window open each night falling asleep to the sounds of the waves.
Access is easy. Richard and his wife are amazing hosts, there when you need them but also very respectful of our privacy. We spent most of our time on the sand or walking about the very quaint neighborhood.
This was our perfect little getaway.
Thank you again Richard! You will see us again."

Stayed one night","Such a wonderful weekend getaway to celebrate my fiance's birthday!! Richard was incredibly responsive and accommodating. We've done other beach properties before, but this little place takes the trophy on beach FRONT!! Your patio is literally steps from the sand. Note to travelers: this place is more of a getaway than a ""just passing through"". It's a little distant from the freeway...but then again, that's exactly what we were looking for. The kitchen is a little small, so if you're planning on cooking, just a heads up! My favorite feature: no boardwalk with tourists and passer-bys to have to hop across to get to the beach like most other places...your patio connects directly to the sand!! Feels like your own private beach. First floor access and simple parking means you don't have to take a journey from your car to the front door. We are totally coming back again in the future. Thank you!!"

The sunsets are worth the stay alone. Richard provides a very thorough and entertaining to read 'manual' with things to do in the area, how to use the bicycles (that he provides), and other quirks of the house.

We had plenty of access to the main features of the house. It was an amazing deal for 4 people to split. Overall, it was a good stay and Olga is a good host. There are notes all throughout the house for ease of communication. I did not have any questions while staying here.
There were a couple of things that we weren't expecting though. Sometimes me and my husband get rooms for the tubs, but during our stay, the tub was not working and we were only told this when there was no time to find another place. There was a piece of wood spray painted with ""no serbis"" over the tub.
There is also a pretty bad ant problem. There were ants that drowned in our cups of water overnight.
We didn't have any problems, but it did not seem like a safe neighborhood."

Stayed one night","It was pretty straightforward checking in! The room was spacious and had a few amenities like a balcony, an en suite master bathroom and a coffee machine, though the drinking water was downstairs. It also had heating and I think AC but we couldn't figure out how to navigate it. The only problem was not the fault of the host. I assume it was a neighbor's dog that was barking, and it could be heard in the room if the windows were opened to let fresh air in."

Stayed one night","I stayed in the master bedroom suite and it is spacious even with 2 beds and very clean. Seriously, this is the cleanest Air BnB I have ever stayed in. I needed to get to the Channel Islands boat early the next morning and this place is a convenient 15-minute drive away. It has windows on three sides and a nearly silent fan which made for good ventilation and cool temperature (in July). A typical southern CA neighborhood with kids playing in the street when I arrived, but they quickly got out of the way so I could park in the driveway and were friendly. Although it was Saturday night, the neighborhood was quiet by 9 pm with only a distant background traffic noise which is inevitable in dense Southern California. Olga provided good information in her ad but also as followup and there are a few signs around house to let you know where things are and how to keep house in working order. I only used the Master Bedroom suite - it has small fridge, microwave oven and coffee maker which were plenty for me and a private spacious bathroom. I didn't hear anyone else although there was another vehicle parked in driveway. The lockbox on the inside of the front door that holds the keys for each room confused me at first - once you enter the combination, you need to pull the top of the box towards you to open it. I am so glad I found this place at the last minute and was able to spend a restful night in Oxnard before taking a boat trip to the Channel Islands for hiking the next day - I was refreshed."

Stayed a few nights","Olga's place was perfect for our week long working trip. We spent one night in a bedroom on the main floor and then moved over to the master for the remainder of our trip. Both were clean and comfortable. The house is exactly as shown, kept clean, and has all the amenities we needed- freezer, oven, laundry, plenty of towels, and Netflix. The master bedroom had the two beds we needed, plus a tv in the room, a private porch to sit on in the evenings, and even a whirlpool bath! The neighborhood is a quiet residential area with plenty of parking even with 4 cars at the house. Olga responded to all our questions and was even able to take care of a bee's nest on the room porch while we were out for the day. Absolutely would love to stay here again if we're in town."

There is lots of great lighting in room #4 and a tv and microwave. There is also complimentary coffee and tea. There were more than enough towels for our family of four and the place is kept extremely tidy and clean. Its managed in a way where you can access the place anytime as long as you read the instructions as there is a code for the main door and a code to access your room key. I highly recommend this place to anyone staying in Oxnard. We had a wonderful time there and would stay there again if we ever got the chance!"

The house had a full kitchen, dining room, living room and tv room available for use for everyone to use. Signs were posted so we all knew what was expected. It had very decor, nice plants out front and a good sized back yard.
Olga was very communicative and has a very nice home. We hope to stay there again when visiting Oxnard!

It has microwave, mini fridge, coffee and all your basic needs. It has a dining table too. The bathroom is spacious. There are two queen beds if you are looking for more room. But it did not take away from the space or make it feel more crowded. This master room is super spacious and well laid out. Downstairs there is a full kitchen available, but we did not use it. The self check in process was seamless. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you Olga."

My room was clean, comfortable, and more spacious than I was expecting. There was a small hiccup with check in but it was figured out really promptly and easily. Because I was a single woman traveling alone, I was a bit worried about safety. I felt perfectly safe and secure the whole time in large part because of the safety measures Olga's place has set up - video camera and deadbolt on the door. Olga's place will be my first choice of places to stay next time I visit the Ventura/Oxnard area."

It costs a little more than 1-3, but it's a big master bedroom, has two beds, a walk in closet, a little balcony, and a his and hers sink, along with both a tub and shower. Good sized kitchen with a large 25 cu ft side by side fridge, lots of cabinet space, good sized stove/oven (I cooked a turkey for thanksgiving in it!) A little toaster oven, plenty of dishes and utensils, a few other kitchen amenities. It's kept immaculate! There's a large TV in the Family Room, internet throughout the house (they installed an extra router/access point in Room 2 to increase coverage.)
I can go on and on... In fact I have in other reviews for Room 1 and 2!
Olga's Place is a Great Value, again, I have to force myself to gush about the place.
I'm also afraid it will get too popular! ;-)

Stayed a few nights","I keep on saying it: Olga's Place is a Great Value Overall! I feel very comfortable here. It's clean, it's spacious, even the smallest room #1 is well sized, Room #2 is a very good size. I haven't stayed in room #3 yet, but Room #4 is a great value too! It's a master bedroom with two beds, it's own master bathroom with a Jacuzzi, there's a good sized kitchen downstairs, though room #4 has it's own mini fridge and a coffee maker and microwave. A large walk in closet, a little balcony. The views aren't great, it is a regular neighborhood. But you're not far from the beach and shopping, etc. For me it's great, there's lots of good food, particularly seafood, my jam lately. Oh, the backyard has a place to have my morning coffee and read the news. Nice little front deck too, very mellow. Clean, clean, clean! Safe! Thanks Olga and Salvador!"

Everything was easy to find and Nikki even told us where the beach stuff was in case we wanted to use it at the beach for the days we stayed. The beach was such an easy walk and the whole trip was so relaxing!

Group trip","We really loved this place! Nikki was a great host, I had a few questions for her & she was very fast with texting back. We came for a ladies birthday weekend & she had left us with a note and a bottle of wine- very very thoughtful & birthday girl loved the gesture. We also asked if we could check in a little earlier & that worked. She was very helpful & quick to respond! Very nice beds & we slept great. We were 7 women & it was enough space for us. 2 big beds & 2 day beds & a full sized bed. Kitchen is amazing & had everything we needed. We also found a little store across the street that had a few things we had forgotten.
5 mins nice stroll to beach & it’s a very nice and quiet one. Very cute neigbor hood. Street was bigger & more traffic than we had anticipated but you couldn’t hear it once inside.
We will come back and stay at Nikki’s place next time we are visiting Oxnard Shore.
Thanks again ;-))"

Stayed over a week","Nikki’s place is exactly as listed and pictured! Her home is beautifully decorated, bright, cheery and luxurious. We thoroughly enjoyed the open floor plan, inviting indoor and outdoor space, high end appliances, well equipped kitchen, extremely comfortable beds and amazing attention to decorative detail! The home is in a safe, walkable neighborhood close to the beach, restaurants and attractions. Nikki was very communicative, accommodating and responsive and checking in and out was seamless. We have stayed in numerous AirB&Bs over the years and this one ranks at the top of the list. We hope to be back again during the Summer months to enjoy the great proximity to the beach and the pool and hot tub that are literally steps away. Thank you Nikki and Pon for sharing your lovely home with us and for your gracious hospitality!"

She has lots of great things available in this Airbnb and it was a comfortable and beautiful space to stay."

Group trip","A Comfortable Gem Close to the Beach with an Exceptional Host
This beach house is the epitome of comfort and quality, and it's just a short walk from the beach. From the luxury mattresses to the well-equipped kitchen, every detail is designed for a relaxing stay.
The location is unbeatable, with everything you need close by—including a brewery right across the street.
What truly sets this property apart is the responsiveness of the owner, Nikki. We had a few minor issues, but she was quick to address them, ensuring our stay was nothing short of amazing.
Highly recommended!"

Group trip","Nikki's place was absolutely stunning! When we first walked in, we were in awe of the beautiful aesthetics and decor of the entire house. Everyone felt right at home and the couches, beds, and furniture were all very comfortable. We celebrated a birthday in Ventura which was an easy 10-minute drive to great restaurants, breweries, and nature. The house was right next to the pool area and Nikki left plenty of towels for all of us. We even walked the 5-minutes to catch the beautiful sunset nearby. I highly recommend it and will definitely be staying here again whenever we return to the area. Thanks again Nikki for the great experience!"

Stayed with kids","Our family chose this home because of the proximity to the beach, as well as all the gorgeous photos of the interior. When we arrived, we were thrilled at what a gorgeous and spacious layout we could call home. The pool area is adjacent to the home, making the location ultra convenient.
The home is also on the front corner of the lot, so it's 1) very easy to find and 2) very easy to access the beach, which is tucked away in a residential neighborhood preventing heavy traffic from coming through. It's almost like your own private beach.
The beds were ultra comfortable and I was able to get a good night's rest. Great mattresses are key to top notch AIRBNB's.
I would totally bring the family back to stay here. Less expensive than staying in Santa Barbara, but we were still able to take the AMTRAK Pacific Surfliner (55) minutes north and spend the day there anyway. The Oxnard AMTRAK station is only 10 minutes from the home.
A perfect stay at a perfect home.
Thank you, N&P!"

The beds were very comfortable and there were plenty of extra blankets to snuggle in when lounging on cool evenings.
The pool is right next to the unit and has an outside shower to rinse off after the beach also.
Nikki even took the extra time to help coordinate birthday decorations before our arrival!!
Close enough to Santa Barbara for a short drive to fun wine tasting areas!
Highly recommend!"

Nikki is a great host and even though we had an issue that was just an honest mistake, she went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of correctly.

We had a change to our dates and timing that she was able to accommodate without any issue at all and was always writing back to me within minutes. The home was stunning! From the roominess of the three level home, to the spacious living area we spent all of our family time in, to the impeccable decorating and high end appliances we felt like we were right at home. This brand new home was perfect for our family of seven (and there was room to spare)! We would definitely stay again and appreciate Nikki and Pon opening up their home to us! :)"

Nikki & Pon were very detailed in their communication on “check in” instructions and were incredibly helpful & responded right away if we had any questions. You can tell that they are very lovely, caring people.
They provided us with great info on Restaurants and fun activities nearby.
Stunning Sunsets viewed from the 3rd floor roof-top patio!
Easy walk to beach 5min stroll.
Heated community pool & spa located right next to the unit felt like our own private oasis.
Kitchen was fully stocked with cooking supplies & yummy herbs & spices. Coffee bar & built in stove top griddle made for lovely pancake breakfast.
Beds were sooo comfie! Pillows & linens were clean & soft.
Shampoo & conditioner were available in each shower/bath.
Their Bohemian Chic vibe really lends itself to be a beautiful and tranquil environment. Thank you for our wonderful stay in your lovely home! We look forward to booking with you again next time we are in town! Thank you, Paula & Jeff"
