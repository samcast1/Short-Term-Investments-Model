Stayed with kids","Holly was such a great host and is very fast to reply.
The place is exactly as described. My kids enjoyed the popcorn Holly left out.
My son said the top bunk isn’t the most comfortable, but that it was fine enough for our fast trip.
Our only issue was that the fire alarm was disconnected from the ceiling and then started beeping early in the morning due to low battery. Battery cover was stuck, so I couldn't remove the battery. I assume the cleaner couldn't get it open either as it was just sitting on the dresser upon arrival. Holly was great when I mentioned it and said she would get it replaced.
The price is great, the home is great (squeaky bathroom doors ànd all!). The location was perfect for us as my kids could walk down to family nearby.
I wouldn't hesitate to book again during our next trip.
Thanks again, Holly! You've done a great job on this one!"

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed our stay at this airbnb! It is an older home so there is some ""character"" that some people may not enjoy, for example; orginal doors that took a little figuring out to open. We personally love older homes and antiques, so it only added to our experience! As others have said, there is a church across the road so you will hear church bells, but it was not disruptive at all. The price is very fair and Holly is extremely accommodating and responsive. We would absolutely stay here again!"

Stayed with kids","Looks good in pictures but uncomfortable in person. I don’t think the host has spent a night here. Poor noise insulation leads to limited privacy within the house. Plastic covered mattresses on bunk beds are uncomfortable for teens and adults. Front door has big window with no curtain, feels like a fishbowl. Not enough extra blankets. Pullout couch mattress had mouse poop. Overall nothing horrible or unsolvable, just… not comfy. We adjusted some things and some expectations and had a decent stay but were a little disappointed."

Thanks again, and job well done."

Stayed one night","Hollys place is in a quiet neighborhood except for the church bells, they stopped chiming at 9.00pm. It did not bother us. The house was clean and tidy and clutter free. There is no usable space outside in the front or back yard. My only complaint was the living room rug was badly stained. She assured us it was being cleaned on Monday, but not in time for our visit. Holly was very pleasant when we were communicating."

Stayed with kids",Easy to find and conveniently located. Close to downtown Safford and family we were visiting. Easy walk to the grocery store or restaurants for food. We’re a family of 6 and everyone had a bed and plenty of room. The church across the street does have a bell that sounds every hour but not before 7am or after 9pm. It didn’t really bother us during our stay. Was a great home base for all the activities we had planned. Definitely plan to stay again!

Stayed one night","The outside is ""under evolution"" so it looks a bit rough. Step inside and everything is fresh, clean and inviting. There was even some fuji apple water and some chocolate! Very nice to find as we arrived. The location is right in the heart of town and there is plenty around. A few people mentioned church bells which we did hear however they did not ring at night. The neighborhood is very peaceful and quiet. It looks like the entire area is growing quickly but it still has the small town feel. Have fun! Check it out..."

It was great to be able to use the garage and laundry facilities. The backyard and patio was lovely, too. And Donelle was great to work with. The only negative point, and this is extremely minor, is that the description mentioned shampoo and conditioner, but there was none, nor shower gel or bar soap. There was, however, liquid soap for hand washing, which may also have been meant for showering. But no worries. For a very small town it was such a nice and convenient place to stay while gathering for a family funeral. I would certainly stay again."

Donelle has thought about everything you would need for a relaxing trip and made sure to have it ready for you when you show up. I love the fire pit in the large private back yard.

Our kids spent a lot of time in the backyard playing games as opposed to in the house on their phones and TV."

We all enjoyed sitting around the fire pit at night and having a barbecue in the backyard after exploring Ropers lake .The home was very clean and my kids absolutely loved the kids room. My kids really enjoyed sleeping on the cabin bunkbed and felt like they were camping. Ha ha it was super cute. I highly recommend staying here. I can’t wait to go back and reserve this home again. It definitely beats staying at a hotel 100%"

Stayed with a pet","It was very nice and homey. Better and bigger then expected. I went to visit my mom and sister that live there in town for mother's day. I will definitely check Everytime I visit if this home is a available. Great huge backyard clean and great for my dog. Was a nice home with a nice kitchen that was able to have my sister her husband and my nieces over for a nice family dinner. Quite neighborhood private home. I felt safe and at home.
I do recommend if visiting with a dog bring a extra blanket for them so they can cuddle on couch or bed. My dog is a lap dog for the last 12 years of his life to tell him he couldn't sit with me he wouldn't listen. Rule is to lay a towel or blanket down to protect furniture from dog hair. Which is a good rule I'm not complaining, it's how it stays nice. Luckily I found a extra blanket in the closet, but felt bad to dirty it 😂"

Beds were comfortable. having 2 bathrooms was great. Only negative is the bunk bed in 3rd bedroom. the top bed is way to close to ceiling and ceiling fan. Hopefully they change that bed to a double bed or 2 singles. Even though that bedroom is small it would be more functional.

I also slept like a baby there and had absolutely everything we needed and more. I loved cooking there and cleaning the house was super easy. check out also wasn't ridiculous which I appreciated. we will definitely stay here again. I stayed in lots of vacation rentals in Safford and Thatcher and Wilcox and this is one of the only treasures that I have encountered. she also had hot chocolate there for guests, in which I would have gracefully siphoned down my throat if I wasn't on a diet.😭😂"

I've rented many and there is always a few and understandable but she want almost everything done and you still pay a cleaning fee. I would not rent this place again."

Anneta had a beautiful Christmas tree in the corner, with colored lights, which made our stay before Christmas very homey and comfortable.
The front porch is well-lit. The carport is great for the sun and rain.
Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and this home felt like our home away from home. Thank you, Anneta, for being a gracious host."

Entering the house was a breeze and Upon entry Shanna had a typed out communication book for us to look through if we had any questions. She even gave local recommendations and a list for when it was time to leave. The list was NOT overly complicated and the home was easy to clean. The neighbors were nice and it was so quiet at night, which we loved. The birds singing outside the window woke me up before my alarm but it was such a a beautiful amd natural way to wake up. Shanna was amazing with communication. She's very sweet, punctual, and the Home is so Beautiful. There was even games and books for the kids and a spacious backyard. looking forward to staying here again. 😊 Best Stay we've had in the Safford/Thatcher area and we've stayed at most Vacation Rentals. 🩷 Thanks again Shanna 💛"

Kitchen offers a large fridge, gas stove and surprisingly more cabinets than even I was able to fill. I travel prepared, so I brought my own pots, pans They are in the process of completing the landscaping in front.
We did have an issue with the A/C not cooling properly. One phone call to Marsha
and a tech was out within a couple hours.
Considering it was a Friday afternoon, that was to be expected. The next day it stopped runniing. One call to Marsha had a tech at out 15 minutes. But before he arrived, her husband showed up with two portable A/C units. Set them up as a backup. They were very attentive to our needs. We would definitely stay there again.
Thank you, Marsha and Johnathan.
Our little ones were thrilled with their ride on your tractor!!
We look forward to our next stay."

They way surpassed my expectations. Couldn’t say enough good about it. But best of all it was a wonderful gathering place for our family to hang out and enjoy each other’s company. We are from Arizona, but had people from California come. We were honoring their mother at a memorial service at a cemetery near the house. Everything went fabulously and everybody come and such a good time they had. Definitely the home, and its surroundings made that enjoyment, all the better. Even though we had another Airbnb in Pima for the overflow. It was nice to have 14 of us there to enjoy each other!
We would definitely love to do it again sometime."

We came for the weekend to go to our daughter's choir concerts at Eastern Arizona College. This was the perfect stay for us. The home is absolutely beautiful and we love all of the period accents such as the door handles and wood trim. The rocking chairs on the porch allowed us to enjoy the wonderful weather and there was even a super friendly orange tabby kitty that stopped by to say hi. The flowers around the porch along with the home's features made it feel like we were at a fairytale cottage. Our only regret is that we did not spend as much time inside the home as we would have liked because our schedule was jam-packed. Next time, we would like to cook dinner and sit around the gorgeous dining room table. We will definitely stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","We were in Safford for a Star Barn wedding weekend. My parents are 82 & thriving, but I needed a comfortable place for them to stay. My father grew up in Safford, so he knew the area.
Shannon’s property offered fantastic amenities, enough sleeping room & an adorable porch to just sit & enjoy the peaceful neighborhood.
It was wonderful.!
The only call-out is to have the porch lights on a longer timer, so they don’t shut off sooner than the sunrise. It’s very dark without the porch lights on.
It’s a safety issue to me.
Other than that, this property was ideal. Thank you Shannon …"

Had a fully stocked kitchen, dining room, two bedrooms, living room, and a porch. Entire house for myself. The place is clean and it is a beautiful historic house. Made friends with a neighborhood cat who greeted me each morning.
Shannon had little signs that were very helpful so you know where things are located which was very helpful. I will definitely be back. Thank you Shannon!"

Stayed with kids","The house was a cute, old home that worked out well for our family of 6 to stay for a family reunion. The AC was good (the temp got up to 110 degrees or more so it had to be good), the beds & pillows were very comfortable, we loved everything that was provided like shampoo, dish soap & laundry detergent.
Note: The beds were memory foam and one side is firm, the other more soft. I really liked the firm side which is good because the master bedroom had the firm side up. Some of the beds in the other bedroom had the soft side up which was good because that's how my kids liked it.
When we first arrived, the floors had sand on them that I needed to sweep up. Not a huge deal and there was a broom, vacuum and other items to make that easy. Also, there is not much counter space or food storage space. Lastly, the internet is pretty slow. When we watched movies, it would pause frequently while buffering. I clocked anywhere from about 2 Mbps to about 10 Mbps, usually closer to 3 or 4"

I appreciated all the labels on the cupboards that made it easy to find things and the labels on the walls that made it easy to find light switches. The sofa bed is not a hide-a-bed; rather, it folds down, so it was too short for us (5 adults), but it would work great for a kid. We used the cot and still had plenty of places to sleep. We could have used the air mattress and had room for another person or two. The kitchen had everything we needed. The front porch was very inviting and a great place to sit in the cool of the morning. We are from cooler climates but the air conditioning kept it plenty cool for us during our summer stay. We will stay here again when we come to town!"

Group trip","We needed a place to rest for a night, and this was the perfect option for us. Great location and a cool little house. The owner made sure we were taken care of and responded very quickly to any questions we had. Checkin and checkout could not have been easier. We considered getting a hotel room for the night but decided to try this place instead. So glad we did. It was a much more pleasant stay than a motel room. Definitely worth looking into if you are passing by this way."

Stayed about a week","This is the second time I have stayed at Shannon's place. I love that I have the entire house to myself and the woodwork is beautiful! Lots of little extras - coffee pods, creamer and sugar, muffins, toothbrushes etc. Shampoo, conditioner and body wash are provided by a dispenser in the shower. It is spacious, yet cozy. You are near a street that can get busy sometimes, but I am a light sleeper and I never had any issues. One room is a master suite with a queen bed and the other has a bunk bed with a trundle/pullout mattress. Both bedrooms have separate access to the bathroom. It is also great to be able to do laundry with a full-size washer and dryer on site, with provided laundry detergent. Lots of off-street parking. If I visit Safford again I will try to stay at Shannon's as it has everything I need and a responsive host. Thanks, Shannon!"

She had lots of extras in her home that I did not expect. We were really impressed with how quiet it was at night and the backyard lighting was incredible. The home smelled clean upon arrival and she even had candy for guests which I tore up immediately 😂! I loved watching TV in the recliner and honestly I didn't want to leave. The kitchen was well stocked and the view of the mountains from the front window took my breath away. I also loved that you could either sit outside in the back or on the Porch and both areas were clean and peaceful. Check out a d Check in was hassle-less (if that's a word); Cannot wait to stay here again 🩷

Stayed one night","I plotted a backroads route from Chiricahua back to Phoenix that took me through Safford. This airbnb provided a welcome respite during the journey to Phoenix. I am a flatlander who resides close to sea level and had spent the previous night around 4,300 feet. I did not sleep well at that elevation, and I felt better coming down to around 2,900 feet in Safford. The town and neighborhood seem peaceful. Mt. Graham looms large over the town and is awesome to behold. The house is spacious and comfortable. Meal prep is abetted by the well equipped kitchen and full refrigerator. The host kindly left out some chocolates. I caught up with sleep in the pink house. My thanks to the host for the restorative stay."
