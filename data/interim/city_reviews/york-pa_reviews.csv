Stayed a few nights","This was a fun alternative to a hotel room! Gina was very thorough in her directions and how to access the loft and gave lots of recommendations for the area. We had fun playing with the instruments, games and art supplies that is around every corner so you will never get bored here.
If we ever return to York, we will check availability here first!
Thanks for a fun, comfortable weekend!"

I was actually sick during part of our stay and i felt comfortable recouping on the cozy couch.

Stayed a few nights","Gina's loft is a beautiful zen-den! We were in the area for a tournament at the York Expo, and the loft was the perfect peaceful place to relax and recharge throughout the weekend. We appreciated Gina's proactive, responsive and genuinely helpful communication. The recommended Central Market is close, and a great spot for breakfast and groceries. We have the loft bookmarked as a favorite for when we visit York again."

Stayed one night","We weren't here long, just a quick overnight in anticipation of a tournament at the York Expo Center. We wanted to get a good night sleep so we didn't have to wake up early and then drive 2+ hours. Gina's loft was SO inviting! There was music playing to welcome us, and homemade biscotti (so delicious!!) from a local baker! The place is eclectic, which you can see from the photos, and very cozy. It's a really fun space, and we slept well (my son slept in the bed, I slept on the futon). We got up early and went to the Central Market for breakfast. Would have loved to explore more, so we'll keep this place in mind for a return visit. Gina was an exemplary host: very friendly with great suggestions and made everything so much easier for us. Thank you, Gina!"

Stayed a few nights","This is the first bad review I’ve written on AirBnB and I want to be as fair as possible given the circumstances. The reasons I decided to write this review are safety concerns.
In brief, I struggled to find the garage door when I arrived at night because there were no lights outside and the garage was the whole way at the end of the property.
Then, I parked my car (street parking) and went in. Once you’re in the unit, it is only the garage door keeping you secure (I looked it up—garage doors with codes are considered less secure than a deadbolt). There was no bolt on the door to the unit, only a couple of latches that you could flip from the inside.
When I left the next day I found my car had been broken into and someone had attempted to steal it. It had to be towed.
The host did not let me out of the rest of my reservation after my car was jacked at her property. I had to work through AirBnB to get refunded for the days I did not use."

Stayed with kids","Gina is by far the best host I’ve ever had the pleasure of dealing with on AIRBNB. She makes you feel right at home and like you are a member of her immediate family. She provides anything and everything you need for your stay and one of our most important aspects of staying with an AIRBNB is privacy and Gina absolutely gives you this. She is a true professional and goes above and beyond to make your stay memorable. Her space is truly one of a kind and so very unique, we loved everything about the loft, it was just simply perfect! We no longer need to search high and low for a safe place to stay in York. If you are ever in the area, I highly recommend giving Gina and her spaces a go and you will not be disappointed. Thank you for everything Gina and we will see you again in the future. Take care of yourself."

Gina is a stellar hostess, always available, and provided some great recommendations for us. If we ever find ourselves in York again, this will be our top choice for accommodations!"

Stayed one night","Where do I begin? My friend and I were seeking a one-night stay for a festival I was playing at over the weekend. As soon as I searched for accommodations I knew Gina's lovely loft was the one just by the photos. Due to my schedule, I also requested an earlier check-in time so my guest and I could arrive and get settled before hitting the festival. Gina was not only lightning-fast in her response but was so gracious in allowing an earlier check-in time. She also offered an even earlier check if guests weren't staying the night prior. She made the messaging experience feel like I was speaking with an old friend! Loved that!
Overall, her communications throughout the entire experience were friendly, warm, and timely. She was extremely thorough in giving us directions and how-tos for arrival and entry. Upon arriving, the street had easy parking getting in with the directions was easy! Entering the loft was like a dream!! Her eclectic taste and decor choices were so thoughtfully picked out and made it a fun and charming place to be. There was light jazz playing, it looked and felt super clean, and the lighting was warm and inviting. The treats and bathroom essentials that were available were also so lovely and made it even more special. There was even a folder full of local recommendations that were most helpful for heading out of town the morning after. After a long festival day, her place was a cozy place to unwind and lay our heads.
All in all our experience was incredible and even more thanks to Gina's amazing communication and friendly nature. I would be more than happy to stay here again next time I am in town. Thank you Gina for everything!"

Stayed a few nights","The place was easy to find. It was advertised that it had two beds and a full bath. However, it only had one bed and futon with hardly any space to pull out futon properly. It does not have a bathtub, only a shower. The place was very dusty and has a crack by the head of the bed which let in a lot of cold air. The guidebooks were not up to date with some places permanently closed. I did love how the owner have a very organic decor which almost makes up for the lack of locks on the door leading to the loft."

Stayed one night","A truly special stay! Gina did a fantastic job of communicating all of the stay details to us: and the space! The care and intention taken to transform the space into a cozy loft is immediately apparent.
The space is smartly partitioned up to create individual ""rooms"", and there a few little nooks that are perfect for reading the local guide that Gina has put together.
Scattered throughout the loft are a few provisions and soaps from local stores. York has a lot to offer to visiting guests and Gina left us with a great guide/magazines to show what was out there."

Stayed about a week","Our stay at Gina’s loft was an exceptional experience!! One of our best from many stays with Airbnb. The loft was absolutely adorable. Once we walked though the door and up the stairs the feeling of a garage space disappeared! We walked up the stairs into the living space to be greeted by the aroma of lavender in the air, the sound of soft jazz music, a treat of locally made biscotti in the well stocked kitchen, and locally made soaps and shower fizzies in the spacious bathroom. The decor was very cozy. Felt like home. Gina’s taste is very artsy and eclectic. Energetic, just as her personality seems to be. The loft had everything we needed to make our stay in York wonderful. All of our experiences with our hosts have been great but again, Gina made our stay a more personal experience. She reached out to us many times throughout our stay and ask if we needed anything and offered suggestions on places to go. Sometimes her message was a simple as “I hope you have had a wonderful day!” We never had the opportunity to meet her in person, but If we did, I’m sure her personality would be just as lively and friendly as she made our stay!!! THANK YOU GINA!!!! 💕"

Stayed a few nights","Loved everything about this place! Let me preface this by saying I typically choose places that are more minimalist with clean lines and bare surfaces. But my daughter who I was travelling with (visiting York College) saw this place and really wanted to stay here. So glad we did! Gina has done such an amazing job with this space. Eclectic and inviting, quirky and so comfortable. Everything we needed was there and Gina was extremely communicative--available if you needed anything but entirely non-intrusive.
Location is fabulous--can easily walk to the hospital or college (1+ miles but an easy walk) and downtown is nearby. We had planned to go out to dinner our last night there but instead brought food in because it was such a great place to just chill. The hammock chair is so comfortable that I'm pretty sure I'm going to buy one for my deck at home.
Little touches made it even more welcoming: candles you were encouraged to burn, music on when you arrive, local biscotti and soap, a map where all the guests can put a pin of where they're from (we were the first to stake our city in California.)
If my daughter decides to attend York College, I will always choose to stay here when I visit if it's available. There is nothing I didn't love about this place. Well, there were birds that may be nesting right by the window at the head of the bed and they love to make a lot of noise to greet the rising sun, which wasn't my favorite thing, but I can't blame them for that. :) Nothing else I would change."

What I loved most was Gina. I had a really rough day before I got there to check in and she had the place low-lighted, diffuser going, and fresh lavender hanging in the shower for me when I got in around 10:30pm.

P.S. if you love pine (we think thats what it was) you will be amazed by the ceiling of the loft :) highly recommend!!

Stayed a few nights","Gina's apartment: comfortable, a good firm bed, a compact kitchen that had all we needed, and a living space that is artfully decorated and full of whimsy. Great visual interest. The lighting is good, plenty of windows for light during the day, and able to be shuttered at night. Good AC and heat. Gina kept it very clean. She communicated with us very well and was available to us if we needed anything. The location is perfect for exploring downtown York."

Gina is so thoughtful from the art around the space to the tasty biscottis. She provided suggestions on things to do and restaurants and even checked in with me on the app to remind me of the check in time.
This was a very short stay
For my friend and I this time but I’m looking forward to a longer stay in the future. Thank you, Gina!"

Gina left ample amount of towels wash clothes and everything was really clean. She even had lavender on the showerhead for a peaceful calming shower experience.
She left a note there for us to login to the Wi-Fi and there was a book there for patrons to write a little note.
She had clean sheets and pillowcases available and the space is so beautifully decorated. It’s truly a one-of-a-kind gem in York."

Stayed a few nights","My stay with Gina was nothing short of amazing. I got married on 4/17 in York and the loft was the perfect setting for “getting ready” pictures. My girls all complimented on the style of the loft. Also- so spacious for being a loft! Enough to fit 7 bridesmaids, a flower girl, my mom, my aunt, three hairdressers AND me! Gina was so pleasant and quick to respond to any texts/calls. We even were able to meet each other the morning of the wedding.
This morning, I realized that I had forgotten my bridal bouquet on the table amidst the hustle and bustle. I messaged Gina just to be sure that she was aware they were in there and she offered to dry the flowers for me to keep, knowing that I was upset that I had forgotten them.
An absolute gem of a place and host. My wedding weekend was magical and the loft played a great part in that. I would recommend this stay to anyone."

The fact that the loft is above a garage may be a turn off to some but it feels far more homey than most other Airbnb’s. It can be slightly dark on gloomy mornings but is absolutely sun soaked in the afternoons.
The Loft is located in a really nice neighborhood great for walking/running. Gina is a wonderful, kind host. I would love to stay here again."

It's the pandemic, times are weird, but my boyfriend and I wanted to get away (as safely as possible). Gina covered all the bases to make us feel safe, cared for, and oh so cozy! Her keen eye for interior decor is second to none, so you can really tell she put her heart into her space. The location is perfect - we did take-out all weekend and we couldn't believe how it seemed everything we wanted was 5 mins away! All in all, 10 out of 10.

The combination of Gina being super hospitable and her loft living up to her hosting prowess was incredible. She was easy to reach and easy to communicate with.

It’s filled with a few Nostalgic items, instruments , magazines, games and most importantly it’s culturally diverse. We couldn’t get enough of the homey cozy atmosphere! The rustic/artsy/autumn look made us feel as if we were in an island 🌴 all by ourselves! Gina made sure to keep with the CDC/Covid/health guidelines. We were worried “free,” at all times! In addition, Gina was available to us if and when we needed her! She is a fresh of breath air. Her approach is genuine and professional! We cannot wait to return!! Thank you big Gina!!"

When we arrived there was Jazz playing, the air was gloriously scented, there was a hand written welcome note from the host, there were biscotti from a local bakery, and a little celebratory bottle of champagne because our stay was for a birthday. The decor is so much fun. We had a blast just looking at everything. It seemed there was always something of interest in every corner of the loft. The host also made recommendations for local eateries and activities and she made herself available for any questions we might have had. And the loft was very clean with plenty of sanitizing supplies that made us feel very safe in this crazy pandemic world. If you are considering a stay at this lovely loft, you should go for it. You will not be disappointed. Absolutely a 5 star experience!"

Stayed a few nights","I'm in awe of Gina's place. First off, let's start with the place. You can tell by all of the thoughtful touches and the energy of the place that Gina is one of the best hosts ever. As soon as my partner and i arrived for our weekend getaway, we knew within a second that this place was zen, and exactly what we needed. I'm really big on the small details, and Gina has incense set up, tons of candles, biscottis, soaps from a local shop, chocolates on the bed and a diffuser. Literally all of the things you wouldn't expect to see in an air bnb, but secretly hope for. The space was in pristine condition and SO clean. There is not a single bad thing to say about this place. You can tell just from the communication with Gina that she is a special gem and puts all of her heart and soul into this space. And THAT is what makes a space memorable. My partner and i are already looking for a reason to come back. Thank you Gina for all that you do!"

I loved the design and feel of it - full of creative touches and comfy amenities. I only wish I had more days to experience it. Was here for a weekend getaway and found this a perfect spot - a quick drive to downtown, easy to access from the highway, street parking right next to the loft. Gina is quick to respond and leaves thoughtful tidbits for the guests. If I come back to York, I am definitely going to try to rebook this space!"

Inside is a generous layout with multiple seating areas, a table for 4, full kitchen, and bed nook. Lots of windows and light. Bathroom was extremely clean and the way the furniture is laid out provides visual privacy from other parts of the space. Gina has collected all sorts of items that are displayed around the place and it feels eclectic and fun.
Wi-Fi worked well and the bed was super comfy. Perfect for my multi-day business trip. Parking is on the street and not an issue, always a space nearby.
Thanks again, Gina! What a gem you’ve created!"

Stayed one night","Granted we arrived very late at night and left early. The place is VERY cute once you’re inside. The access to the unit through a scary (especially in the dark) side garage (which is very much a garage) was pretty off putting to my wife. You almost don’t want to open the door leading up to the loft because it’s not exactly welcoming. That being said, once in the loft it is a cute, quirky and clean space. Gina was a sweetheart and you can tell she loves the loft. Walkability score of the neighborhood is very low but I’m a spoiled CA guy, what do I know."

Gina’s place is visually stimulating with so many cool touches that includes all the comforts of home and then some. Most comfortable mattress and couches to relax on ever. The mood was set from the moment I walked in with jazz music playing and homemade biscotti on the table. Her place also serves as inspiration for anyone looking to reuse everyday objects into artisan conversation pieces. Place was immaculate in terms of cleanliness and Gina herself was nice enough to great me and just say hello and let me know to contact her if I needed anything. Location is very private and was only about 5 mins from eateries. Would highly recommend and will hopefully be back in the future 😊"

Stayed a few nights","St. Clair was an amazing hostess. She communicated perfectly, always responding quickly back, she even left us some fruits and a bottle of wine in the kitchen. The apartment itself was very clean. At first I was a bit shocked that the photos didn’t fully reflect the reality - just based on the online profile I had thought that the apartment had a cozy modern style, but in reality it was more rustic - but over time it grew on me. I guess the only disappointment was my sleep: the sofabed where I ended up sleeping had a very thin uneven spring mattress and the windows were so old that I could hear everything that was happening on the street - I didn’t sleep well that night. However, my children slept in the bedroom on a regular queen size bed and they didn’t complain."

Stayed a few nights","I really enjoyed my stay in York. I liked the colorful rooms and the the decorations and art. It is obvious the owners take pride in their place. I did not get to cook a meal in the kitchen, but it looked fully equipped. The bed was comfortable, the linens clean, and the apartment was large. The kitchen had a nice counter where I was able to work and attend company zoom meetings during the day. The WiFi is excellent. The reserved parking space is right behind the building and a very short walk to the front door. You are in the top floor, so you have a few sets of stairs to climb, but I'm 64 and had no trouble getting my duffel and backpack up to the apartment. Its located in the City, so if you are a light sleeper, be prepared for the occasional ambulance or car playing loud music if you decide to go to bed early. I dont recall the name, but we walked to an Italian restaurant 4-5 blocks away that was good."

The location is very convenient; staying downtown within a very short walk to the Appell Center and the many restaurants, bars, small shops, and a few breweries nearby made for a nice stay. We parked the car in the designated space and walked everywhere we wanted to go. St. Clair made the stay really easy & communication was excellent."

They answered my hundreds of questions within minutes and allowed us to check in early. They made our quick getaway a stress free one. Second, upon arrival we were greeted with chocolates, fruit, and a complimentary bottle of wine that was delicious! Lastly, the Airbnb was spectacular with beautiful art throughout the house and CLEAN! It was also in a great location within walking distance of breweries, restaurants, and cute little shops. Needless to say if you’re ever in York STAY HERE!"

The centralized location of the place made it easy for us to walk everywhere. It is only a two minute walk from restaurants and bars.
The place itself was also very nice. It was clean the furniture and decor was week thought out and homey! We felt very comfortable there and couldn’t have been happier!
Finally, our hosts were amazing! St. Clair checked in with us throughout our stay without ever being invasive! We felt like any request we would make would have a response immediately. Fortunately for us the place was so nice we needed nothing!! I cannot recommend highly enough!!"

Stayed a few nights","Great apartment slightly tucked away from the hustle and bustle of downtown stores; yet close enough to enjoy local eateries and local shops. York has such historic buildings and while this is also true for the apartment, its furnishings were modern and so were the appliances.
And yes the posting for this place is accurate—you will need to be able to bring yourself and bags up three flights of stairs. But once we arrived we were able to feel well cared for and slightly tucked away.
Not the most comfortable bed and we still had some trouble sleeping because we were able to hear traffic from the downtown streets. However, if you’re okay with this, it’s a great stay. Much value for the stay.
St. Clair responded quite quickly to any questions and concerns I had which I appreciated and knew I could count on my hosts if anything came up."

The home itself was tastefully decorated and made us feel like we were was home. It was bright and what we needed from being in a hospital most of the day. It had all the little things that made you feel welcome from chocolate on the pillows to wine in the fridge.
Though, if you have heavy luggage you may want to leave what you do not need, the stairs are long and two flights, but definitely worth the stay! :)"

The apartment itself was clean. The decorations added a homey feel and the furniture was comfortable. The desk was perfect for me to do school work at.
Unfortunately, I stayed during a time of 95-100 degree weather on the 3rd floor apartment. However, shutting all the blinds/curtains and turning on the AC units cooled it down.

If you don't want that level of contact, there is also a recommendations binder in the living area, complete with local attractions and drive-able destinations.

York is a real city with real city noise (i.e., delivery trucks in the neighborhood at 6 am), but we slept peacefully and felt perfectly safe and snug in this third floor apartment. We even saw a phenomenal sunset from the roof-top terrace! I will definitely recommend the suite to all my friends and family."

Stayed with kids","So glad I found this place! We were in town for a 3 day swimming competition and it was so nice to have space to spread out and a kitchen to accommodate my athletes’ needs.
It is an older building in a busy area so sound machines were a must. The stairs were a little tough while carrying things in and out but nothing we couldn’t manage.
The personal touches made us feel right at home. They left a lovely note wishing us good luck at the competition, juices for the kids, and a great bottle of wine for mom. One son claimed all the pillow mints (york peppermint patties, of course) and the other was delighted to find a dish of hershey kisses.
I’m already thinking about next year’s competition and will likely book again when I find out the schedule :-)"

It is worth mentioning this unit is up a long flight of wooden stairs - just something to be aware of, especially with young children. Location was nice because we could easily walk to the main street for food and coffee. We even walked to a nearby park for our 3 year old. Highly recommend staying at this spot in York!"

Stayed a few nights","This place is a super cute apartment located near the heart of downtown York. The place is a lot bigger than what the pictures suggest and it was super comfy. First, the host were very responsive after I didn't clearly read the instructions, they helped me out a great deal. The place is clean and is perfect for a group of 4-6 people. The beds were comfy and the neighbors were friendly. Parking was convenient as they hold an assigned parking space, it was stress free. The best thing about my stay were the small personal touches! They left York peppermint patties on our pillows, written notes to personalize our stay, got us a local bottle of wine that we enjoyed to the fullest. I can tell the host pay attention to their guest needs and occasions. The neighborhood is really cool! We walked down to the White Rose restaurant where I had the best crab cake ever known to man. Overall, thank you to the hosts for sharing your space with us, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. I will be back!!!"

Everyone worked and was clear. It was surprisingly spacious -especially considering the price. We were briefly confused about the location, but we rang the smart door bell and St. Clair responded immediately. Too easy.
Coming after 6 on a Friday means street parking was free and plentiful. But you don't need to park on the street because there was a dedicated spot. If we come back to York, we would not look for another place. This is it."

The apartment itself is beautiful. It was clean and cool and very comfortable for the four of us. The available parking space was a huge plus for being in the central part of town.

They have plenty of starting amenities, full size bathroom products, and most inviting and sweet was the drinks left in fridge with a very personalized note. The place has window a/c which wasn’t installed yet but when discussing the high temperature they offered to have management install for us. We declined and shut room darkening curtains and blinds and turned all fans up so it would stay cooler during the day while we were gone. When we came home on Friday night there was some outdoor activity nearby (party perhaps). We were pleasantly surprised at how once inside we couldn’t hear the people at all. And more impressive was everyone retreated inside when it got later; following noise ordinances perhaps. It’s truly a perfect place to stay in York and in walking distance to many places which we walked to."

Stayed with kids","The pros - great location in town near restaurants and shops, sizable apartment, good value for the price.
There is an event venue nearby. We heard noise from that venue in the early evening hours - not a problem at all since it ended before bedtime. Although we expected some noise overnight due to the in-town location, the noise level was much louder than expected - many sirens (possibly due to storms?) and other loud noises (trash collection?).
It was unseasonably warm on our arrival day. The ceiling fans helped cool down the apartment. The temperature dropped overnight, and the heat (radiators) did not work in the morning. We utilized two provided electric heaters but tripped the circuit breaker.
St. Clair kindly came out to the apartment to take a look at things. He apologized for the lack of heat, as he thought the issue had been resolved. He got the heat working and fixed the circuit breaker. By the time we left, the radiators were no longer putting out heat."

They made our stay feel special by leaving roses on the bed and wine/champagne in the fridge. They also upgraded the mattress to a new one during our stay since they received a new one while we were there.

Stayed a few nights","I grew up in York but never lived or stayed downtown, so The Suite Life was a fun adventure for our family of four adults. We loved the walkability to local restaurants and pubs and had fun exploring Historic York landmarks, art installations and interesting shops like The York Emporium used book and music store!
St. Clair and Rhea were wonderful hosts, so communicative and eager to make us happy. The apartment is roomy, spotless, and offers the amenities we needed during our stay for my mom’s 95th birthday. One note: stairs to the apartment are steep. But I didn’t have trouble navigating them even with my somewhat arthritic knees.
Overall, we were glad to find this gem of a place to relax, do some work, and visit family and friends!"

The only drawback to our stay was the beds were not supportive enough for our old achy backs (we're seniors not young spring chickens). Everything else was great. Communication with hosts was especially outstanding, very responsive in answering questions and helping us settle in. Thank you St. Clair!"

at every corner. A one night stay needed to unwind during travels. Just as described, but please be aware of the high stair climb if has elderly or in our case a lot of stuff to bring up. A quiet neighborhood so trucks and car noises can stand out in the middle of the night, also to be aware if troubles sleeping. But it's got everything you can think of and more."

Stayed with kids","The apartment was adorable, and the little extras they leave are so thoughtful. It's within walking distance to restaurants and activities, including an arcade. The only negative is that there is an insect that lives in the tree which hangs over the stairs and parking spaces and it sprays a sticky sap that caused our shoes to get stuck to the staircase as we walked up and down them, and the 'sap' covered our car in a sticky film. We had to go clean our windshield any time we left so that we could see and then went through a carwash to clean everything otw home. It's so sticky it broke our windshield wiper and we had to stop and get new ones."

Stayed a few nights","Location is a lot quieter than I thought- considering how it’s pretty central to good eats!! We absolutely APPRECIATED the noise level because we both worked night shift so it was much needed to be able to come back to a cute apt and just crash. Sheets were so soft and comfy too!! Love the set up and ease of communication with host. I will definitely be back.
Tips:
• Once you get there, turn onto the left of the building (when facing building) to find the parking spot behind the building.
• The shower is tricky- turn it all the way to hot, once it STARTS to get warm, turn it back to cold- close to the “off” text because the water gets extremely hot.
• Steps to the 2nd floor is very steep"

Stayed a few nights","Booked for a week during hospital orientation as travel staff. Absolutely would consider renting again! Host was phenomenal, suite was cozy.
Easy to find, easy to park, easy to check in. Walkable to restaurants, breweries, shops.
A charming old suite - very high ceilings, huge canted bay windows, original hardwood, and retro B&W bathroom tile. Very comfortable!
There was a bottle of wine for me in the fridge, non-perishables in the cupboard, k cups.
Temperature was comfortable in early spring - had ceiling fans, window AC units, and a tower fan.
My only bias: sound travel. Closing the bedroom door helps dampen the sound from the street, as well as running the window AC unit. I used my own personal box fan to drown the residual street noise. (I live on a quiet street! that said, I would still stay again)
I heard no other renters, aside from footsteps above me. Can't beat old plaster walls."

Stayed a few nights","St Clair’s place was perfect! I was hosting an event and needed a place to stay while I was in town and this apartment was literally steps away from the venue. It was clean and well organized. St Clair even left a personalized note wishing me good luck at my event! I thought that was very nice. We’ve stayed in the apartment upstairs before (also owned by St Clair) and both were exactly as described. St Clair went above and beyond to accommodate us. We locked our key in the house and he did not hesitate to help us get back inside. Next time we visit the area, we will be staying at St Clairs again."

It was cute and quaint, but it was an old home, so if you’re looking for something modern, this may not be for you. Overall, the house had all the accommodations to make this day feel much more welcomed. So much so, when I visit again I would love for my wife and I to stay here. Don’t hesitate and book today as you will not regret it."

Stayed one night","There were a variety of fruits on the table and a bottle of local wine waiting when I arrived. The kitchen is a good size but sparsely equipped so cooking would be basic. The temperature was fine for me although it appears the kitchen radiator is missing a cap and air was escaping. The internet worked reasonably well, the bedside power strip with USB charge ports was welcome. Bathroom, shower, linens were great. There are numerous places to dine in easy walking distance. When street and hence the unit are not what you would call quiet, but I was able to sleep and I am a light sleeper. If you want to be near down town York for your stay I recommend this place and would stay again."

We appreciated the special touches, such as a bottle of wine and fruit provided in the kitchen, and proactive communication. The kitchen was well-stocked with a basic assortment of pots, pans, knives, etc. so we were able to do some cooking during our stay. The apartment is on a fairly busy street so be aware of this if you're sensitive to street noise - ear plugs were helpfully provided in the night stands. All in all, we had a very nice stay."

They are very helpful and alway response quickly. They even drop an umbrella off for me on a raining day!
The apartment is spotless. It has everything we need. The location is the best, it’s in the heart of Royal Square which is the best neighborhood in the City of York. There are many great restaurants around within a walking distance.
Their direction and instruction are on point.
They should do a podcast or set up a course to train the other Airbnb hosts on how to host Airbnb and leave guests feeling like they are in their home away from home.
Thank you St. Clair and Rhea. We had a fantastic stay at your apartment."

Stayed a few nights","The host is extremely charismatic and responsive. The locationand unit in my opinion is not a 5 star location at all. To start, the street noise is unbearably loud at time. This is probably due to the make-shift ac panel in the window AC units. In addition, the beds are very old and extremely uncomfortable. The shower is very small and while showering the curtain sticks to you rhe entire time you are showering . Not to mention, there is little to no water pressure at times. Moreover, the kitchen has a poorly located sink with a bathroom fixture that makes it extremely difficult to was rhe dishes. With that said, there is no dishwasher to make up for the poor sink. The host does provide minimal needs and toiletries, but quality is very poor. I had some conversations with the host; however, they were not very concerned with my issues, nor offered and compensation for my concerns ."

Stayed one night","There's so much to recommend about this lovely place. The rooms are big, bright and airy. The burnished wooden floors and woodwork give it a comfy, old fashioned feel. The kitchen is big, with all the acoutrements we needed for our short stay.
There was some issue with noise from a neighboring long-term visitor. Apparently, they had invited people over to watch a sporting event on tv and it was quite loud. It was around 11:30PM when I notified the hosts. I would not be able to sleep through that noise. They said they would talk to the other people and ask them to turn down the noise. It was some time after midnight when I noticed a difference in the volume.
I also did not see very many blankets for the bed. There was one bottom sheet and a thin coverlet on the bed. I put the top sheet on myself and found another thin blanket so we could be comfortable.
I appreciated all the lovely small gestures: the local wine in the fridge, the chocolates, the folder with area restaurants"

Due to a family emergency, I flew in internationally at the last minute to PA and was extremely lucky to see St. Clair's place available. Due to being on the first flight out, we had nothing. St. Clair had the apartment stocked with everything one could need - from toiletries to coffee, even makeup remover wipes (thank you SO much!). St. Clair made the entire check in process so incredibly easy for me that I nearly cried with relief. We received all the information in advance (wifi, codes and even photos) I'm not ashamed to admit I've learned tips to improve my hosting experience from her.
The apt was large and lovely. For a historic building, it was incredibly comfortable with excellent wifi. for us to work remotely.
Thank you, St. Clair. This is everything Airbnb should be!"

There are also many cute shops called the Royal Square District about three blocks from this location with a lovely outdoor courtyard. The host left me a wonderful bottle of wine, snacks, and even chocolates on the pillows. I felt very secure with them - meaning I knew I could be honest if I was struggling with something. That means a lot. This place was conformable enough to enjoy watching tv, taking a nice bath, and relaxing. It did feel like home. They supplied the necessary shower items you made need which is a nice touch. They definitely want to take care of you, not many people really want to do that these days. The bedroom was large. The kitchen had lots of cabinet space and the appliances were in good shape."

Tidy and clean, this large space is welcoming with a lot of character and charm. The pictures are accurate and if you like the look of it you'll be very pleased with the experiene of staying here. Minutes walking distance from great restaurants. We strongly recommend giving this place a visit. The place looks better in person than the pictures, which is saying something. -Randy and Jaelyn"

They were able to accommodate some last minute changes a few days before arrival and went above and beyond in accommodating us. The space is inviting, clean, very pretty, quaint and has everything you need for your getaway. It was so easy to walk to downtown and the hosts offer great recommendations for local restaurants. Check out the Colonial Coffee Shop for breakfast. You won’t be disappointed."

The check in process was straightforward and the apartment was set up with the guest in mind. It was great to kick back after my long drive into town and enjoy the local wine they provided!
I visited in early spring when the building was transitioning from heat on to heat off and it was a bit hot in the apartment. When a mentioned this to St. Clair she immediately gave me a few tips on how to cool the place off and drove over to drop off an extra fan the next day. I was so touched by her thoughtfulness! Both hosts made every effort to ensure I had a comfortable and enjoyable stay.
Lastly, located within walking distance to historic York and many great bars and restaurants, the apartment is a great home base for exploring downtown.
Overall great stay! Would stay again."

We are from York PA and have family there, so we try to visit a couple times a year. I'm so very glad we found this gem called Blue Haven Suite... it's definitely our go-to for future visits! Thanks so much for the awesome hospitality, Raquel."

Stayed one night","What can I say about Raquel's place that hasn't already been mentioned in all the other reviews? Upon entering, we were greeted with a fresh, clean scent that permeated from room to room. The space was incredibly spacious and boasted several seating areas where my boyfriend and I could comfortably engage in conversation. For those who value a good shower experience, the water pressure was fantastic, and the temperature was perfect. Raquel also provided a diverse selection of snacks for us weary travelers to enjoy. Overall, it was a wonderful stay, and the value far exceeded the reasonable price. We would definitely rate it 11/10 and would happily stay again."

The shampoo, condition, and body wash were top quality without harmful fragrances (which my husband appreciates since he is sensitive to chemicals). She provided a BUNCH of snacks for our visit, the best assortment I have seen in all of our travels! It was really thoughtful. The bed was super comfortable and we slept great. It really was the perfect little spot to stay in on our way to Gettysburg the following day:) Raquel was also quick to respond to texts when we had questions."

Example: Fantastic bath towels. Top line shampoo and conditioner. Great dishware and cutlery. Hostess basket of snacks and cold water in the refrigerator and two types of pillows too choose from are just some of the finer touches.
If we ever back to York, PA...we will stay here again. Lovely respite. 😍"

The room was warm, smelled fresh, and there were even little mints/drinks. Even though we didn’t use it the full kitchen was filled and definitely useful.
Would HIGHLY recommend to anyone who needs a quick night’s stay or even an extended stay in york. Only thing thats a heads up is that there is a door in the bathroom that while is locked, leads to their common room. Not an issue for us, but let’s just say you can hear the residents quite clearly."

Communication with Sam & Jai about the reservation and check-in/parking situation was clear and abundant. I wanted to stay longer on the day we checked out so that I could stream the volleyball games rather than risk covid in a crowded gym -- Sam & Jai were very accommodating with a late checkout. In addition, it was very convenient to have them right downstairs when I realized at 9pm that I had misplaced the key to the apartment during our travels during the day. They provided a spare and didn't panic when I told them I was sure the key would turn up the next day (which it did, in my car). Not to mention the apartment was cute, very clean and in a perfect location for volleyball as well as exploring downtown York."

In particular, we went to a show at the Capitol Theatre (about a block away from their place), spent a day biking the Heritage Rail Trail (access about a block away), visited the York Central Market (on the same block), and took a day trip to Lancaster (a bit over half an hour). The parking pass was a tremendous win allowing us to not have to think about the car while it/we weren't using it. The apartment itself is very clean and well-appointed making it very easy to relax and unwind between excursions. It's also worth mentioning that we did enjoy taking our breakfast in the large bay window area while watching the town go about its business."

The space is on the second and third floors of an artfully renovated 1800s building, full of light, and thoughtfully furnished with amenities. Comfortable, charming, luxurious in nearly every aspect, and extra convenient if being downtown is important, this listing is a great home away from home. My favorite parts of the stay were having coffee in the bay window overlooking the morning activities on the street and taking a shower in the gorgeous walk in shower!
Jai and Sam were excellent hosts, easy to reach, full of information, and right downstairs at the Thai restaurant if we needed anything during our stay.

Stayed one night","My wife and I (newly wedded) came right to this lovely hideaway late at night. We had some trouble finding it because it's perfectly secluded but when we did struggle, it didn't last long as the owners were very responsive and willing to help us. The moment we stepped in, we knew it was just right for us. It was quiet, beautiful inside with a nice blend of modern but very rustic charm that fit just right. It Really felt homey.
The wood stove is a great addition for those who miss that old world charm and warmth. Hopefully next time we will be there long enough to need it.
Highly recommend this lovely peice of the earth hidden away from everything."

Dorothy checked in with me during the stay and even came by to meet me, such a gracious and easy going host. The cabin is immaculately clean and cozy and exactly as described. I found the peace and tranquility so relaxing and yet inspirational and productive—got a lot of writing done. Dorothy’s place is a great retreat for the mind & soul, and a terrific value to boot. Already looking forward to another visit."

Because it was so sentimental and beautiful to my gf and I for her bday weekend last year, I decided to make this our engagement vacation. This cabin is a storybook place just for getting away and it served as a storybook proposal. So I came here with my girlfriend and left with my fiancé. 11/10 recommend as not only the home itself is great but the entire area. Met a really nice neighbor and explored, saw plenty of deer, so many picture opportunities! This is truly the place to be!"

Stayed a few nights","The Loomis House was a rustic, cozy cottage. It was as described in the listing and photos. The place is nothing fancy, but it was comfortable and had everything we needed for a quiet holiday getaway. We used it as a home base for exploring York and its surrounding areas. There are some wonderful county parks in the region for hiking and enjoying nature. The city and these parks are about 20-30 minutes from the place. If you are looking for a simple, but comfortable place to getaway from everyday living- Loomis House is a great choice. Be aware that the bedroom is a loft and that you’ll need to go downstairs to use the bathroom at night. It might not be the best for older folks."

The location is centrally located for driving, and great for walking to the different restaurants, shops, and the markets downtown.

Our kiddo used the pull-out bed and had no problems falling asleep and staying asleep. The apartment had lots of extras: sheets, pillows, games, a bunch of cooking utensils, to name a few. We were happy with our stay."

The area is vibrant and I felt safe walking my dogs late in the evening and very early in the morning. Olivia and Skyler were incredibly responsive and proactive in all their communications. I've stayed in a lot of airbnbs and this one is right at the top of my list. I'd stay again in a heartbeat and highly recommend it."

The apartment is one block off of the more busy blocks of restaurants and shops so it was more quiet than we expected. Although it’s on the first floor, the bedroom is in the back of the apartment so street noise wasn’t an issue for us, even on Friday and Saturday nights!
Olivia’s instructions were clear and easy for entry and departure. We felt safe and secure in the space. The place itself was cute and clean and the furniture was comfortable. We had a great time!"

Stayed with kids","Great find! Olivia gave perfect instructions and advice from check-in to check-out.
The apartment is in the heart of downtown with great restaurants and shops within walking distance. Parking can be a bit tricky, but it is downtown and Olivia provided suggested parking options. Unfortunately we failed to pay the meter while loading up the car and ended up with a $25 parking ticket. So, if you’re wondering, yes, they check the meters.
The apartment is clean and cozy with plenty of room for a family of four. We made coffee and breakfast in the mornings, finding everything we needed in the apartment to cook after a trip to the local grocery. The bed was comfortable and the kids made out fine on the pullout couch. The TV was set to stream from Netflix for kids, which was a nice touch. As a final added bonus, the water heater must be a tankless because I showered last and it was actually hot! Thank you!!
We will be back next July."

The kitchen was well-equipped with all the necessary amenities to prepare our meals. The living area was the perfect place to unwind, offering comfortable seating and a selection of books and games that entertained us during our downtime.
We were just a short walk away from some of the city's local attractions. In addition, it was incredibly convenient for us to explore the area on foot and experience the city's vibrant atmosphere.
The host, who was incredibly attentive and friendly, provided us with a detailed guidebook that included recommendations for nearby restaurants, cafes, and parks.
Our stay was exceptional, and we highly recommend this to anyone."

We easily found street parking right in front, and it was during times over the weekend when the parking is free so that was a plus. The place is so homey, clean, you have more than what you need to prep and cook food so you aren’t buying out, games, there’s more extra pillows and blankets and towels than you’ll ever need. I tend to be on edge staying in places that aren’t home but I felt safe and secure in the apartment, even with it being first level. Overall it was a great experience, Olivia’s home is beautiful, and that bed is to die for. I absolutely will and already have recommended to friends and family."

Also, if you decide to park on N. Beaver Street at night when the parking is free, then pay attention to the signs at the corner about the one day/month that you can't overnight park for street sweeping (3rd Tuesday for the east side; 4th Thursday for the west side)"

The parking situation was very manageable, especially considering we visited on the weekend of the St. Patrick's Day parade (held two blocks away). Plenty of good food choices within walking distance, we really enjoyed Neama's restaurant and the Central Market (when it was open). The downtown had a good vibe going with many people out and about the area in the evenings.
Olivia and Skyler were very communicative, ensuring we knew they were there if we had any questions or concerns, definitely deserving the Superhost badge. Although we were not traveling with young children, we noticed many of the small things that would make this location a good choice for a new family."

Olivia's place is exactly as described and had everything you need to live comfortably in the space during your stay. I really appreciated all of the drawers and hanging space in the bedroom so that I could fully unpack and keep the space tidy. My stay was during the coldest nights of the year and the space heater in the bedroom kept me warm and toasty. Olivia was very responsive and a great communicator, providing local recommendations, parking tips, and answering any questions I had. If you're working remotely during your stay, the internet speed was reliable and very fast. If you're cooking, the kitchen is stocked with pots and pans and even some basic spices to get you going. With restaurants out the front door, the location really can't be beat. Thanks for a great stay!"

Our first night we did not know that we were arriving during the York tree lighting and that apparently everyone in the whole surrounding area would be downtown, but even as busy as it was we were able to find parking in the second parking garage had Olivia suggested, which was a short walk to the apartment.

We have family who live in York and hope to make Olivia’s our EXCLUSIVE place to stay for years to come.

I only wish I had gotten up early enough to feed the meter on the morning we left as I did end up getting a parking ticket. If you're smarter than I was about the parking (as I will be the next time around), you can't go wrong staying here if you're visiting York."

Stayed a few nights","This is THE primo airbnb in York PA. The hosts are so sweet, accommodating, communicative and thoughtful - truly, they think of everything. Summarizing a few key points to help solidify THIS as your choice of stay!
Location is perfect - there is always parking available out front so even if you're not familiar with York, you're sure to know exactly where you're staying with the clear directions provided at check-in. Seriously, my meetings kept me out til late and I was always able to pull right into a spot!
The Space - is P E R F E C T. From the thoughtful decorations and personal touches, to the meticulous labels, to the fully, and I mean FULLY, stocked kitchen - you just don't find Airbnbs with such intention, at least, I haven't. The apt is all that is described - and important to note; even though it situated perfectly downtown, it is quiet from the hustle + bustle, the neighbors are virtually non-existent, and the natural light and abundance of windows completely redefine the space. Central Market is a LITERAL hop skip, Mudhook is a block (best bar pub in York, second only to Holy Hound)
Honorable mentions: incredible house plants, dishes (and organization!) are superb, layout is spacious and private.
Check-in: does it get any better? Beer + chocolate, clear instruction, follow-ups, and a warm ambiance as soon as you walk in the door!
Got a little one? You're in luck - there is everything you could possibly need to bring your offspring along. Toys? yep. 'Cool crib'? - Also, yes. Extra sheet - those are there too.
Don't have a kid? Don't worry - its so cleverly disguised that unless you're a mom on a business trip with a keen eye, you're probably not going to notice. Another nod to the excellent organization + labeling + intention you rarely find.
In summation: This airbnb is cleverly designed to induce a relaxing and enjoyable visit to York PA. It is distinct in its design, its Hosts (AND their mom!) are above-par in all the ways you want an airbnb host to be and you're sure to find the things you need here without asking because.....they have already been thought of."

Stayed a few nights","This suite is absolutely amazing!
Extremely comfortable and well set up. The aesthetic was country chic that was pleasant and calming to enjoy.
I especially loved the provided ice trays and the cute kitchenette alcove. Plates and silverware provided with a small wet bar sink made fixing leftovers a breeze and the easy to clean up afterwards.
I’m super grateful for the blackout curtains (as I’m accustomed to working night shift) but also the bed was ridiculously comfortable to me.
The shower had excellent water pressure and enough hot water for two women plus to bathe.
Everything was extremely clean and fresh. The bath linens provided were excellent quality and I am very pleased that the host provided grey towels (along with white) because I do have colored hair and I worry that some coloring may bleed from time to time and I don’t wish to damage white linens.
The location was ideal for my trip and it was easy to get around. I will say that depending on your time of day or day of the week, it could be upwards of 40mins wait for a Lyft or Uber. I personally did not mind as I’m familiar with that fact in smaller towns.
I truly do recommend staying here if you want privacy and a great location at an excellent cost. Also, the host is very responsive and I’ve never had any issues to address but I did reach out about his preferences on check out. He responded immediately and with a detailed message."

Stayed over a week","Being new to Airbnb, I was not certain how to navigate the website correctly so I very much appreciated the timely response from my host concerning the neighborhood of his location, prior to booking. The purpose of my visit was to join my family for the Christmas and New Year holidays; I am not familiar with the area so I preferred to book accommodations near my family's home but had no idea how far or near the choices were to my destination. My host's quick response to my query determined my selection of his location over other potential choices. Coupled with the fact that traveling with my dog did not raise any objections or concerns from my host, I was very comfortable with my decision and excited to meet my host, who was not on site for several days after my arrival!
Upon entering the unit, I noted its cleanliness. Everything sparkled! (I've been in 5 star resort hotel rooms and wondered if I should be concerned about bed bugs but not here!) The unit looked exactly like the pictures, which were also helpful to me in determining what I should pack for my extended stay. After driving over 400 miles, I collapsed into bed and felt like I was curled up on a cloud! The host should add ""comfort"" to his ""cozy"" characterization!
All of the appliances and Wifi services were in good working order and easy to use; I was concerned that the TV volume in the unit or my dog barking to go out might disturb the family after they returned home, but if so, that was not called to my attention. I would be grateful to stay with this host again."

The provided sleep sound machine may have helped but I have never used one. Searched all over and could not find coffee mugs. I had my travel mug so that saved the day. Those are small things compared to how beautiful and comfortable the home was. If the occasion should arise again we would do it again.

Stayed a few nights","Had a lovely stay at the Gray Apple Inn. The inside was very inviting and felt at home. They do have a patio outside that’s not pictured but plenty of space for a few people to gather. The sunroom was darling! Very warm during summer months but in the evening for cooler months I bet it’s perfect! Just noting for anyone like myself who has a hard time sleeping, they don’t have fans in the bedrooms so if your rely on one and can bring one I would suggest it. On hot days there is t as much air movement on the second floor and gets a little stuffy. The traffic can get a little loud during rush hour but by night time it’s get quiet, maybe a car or two passes by but they have provided sleep machine in each room which was greatly appreciated! Rooms were spacious and clean. Would love to come back again!"

There was construction going on all day Saturday behind the house. The construction continued at 7am on Sunday, so we couldn’t sleep in. But that was the only downfall we had which obviously was out of the owners’ control. We enjoyed looking around at all the decor. Everything was beautiful and we would def stay there again in the future."

The house was beautifully decorated with items from their home decor shop (Grey Apple Market), which is less than a block away- if you're staying here GO IN THE MARKET- so much cool stuff ¨̮ The bright and open downstairs was perfect for hanging with our friends while we watched baseball on TV, and the bedrooms upstairs were super cozy and comfortable. We had plenty of space for the 6 adults staying.
We travel to York in August every year to visit family and will ABSOLUTELY stay here again if the house is available."

Stayed one night","This is a gorgeous house! The kitchen is restful and the living furniture is comfortable and cozy. A perfect place to gather with friends.
There were several things that were unexpected and disconcerting.
Although there were two beautiful bathrooms, with amazing showers, the one bathroom had no washcloths, the other had only two washcloths, in spite of the house easily sleeping six people in three bedrooms.
The kitchen is poorly appointed. The forks are all child sized with matching spoons. There is a coffee pot, but only instant coffee packets. There was tea and marshmallows for hot chocolate, but no hot chocolate or tea pot.
Bring a sound machine if you live in the country. The sound of traffic is constant all night long.
We only stayed one night and we enjoyed our night, but we would not go back."

Stayed a few nights","Cathy's place was really beautiful and basically a house straight out of the magazine. Everything was pristine and so clean. I felt like I was at an open house, the staging was impeccable. Every bed was so comfortable and she had a lot of items for use in the kitchen to cook a meal and the bathrooms readily available. I would definitely stay again next time. The Gray Apple store is just a short walk from the airbnb. I cannot say anything bad aside from the last day when the air conditioning wasn't working properly, but we were leaving the next morning so it didn't bother us. Cathy's husband was right next to the house and was quickly able to call for services to fix it immediately. The communication was wonderful between us, she was upfront and able to respond quickly for any issues that came up, which was minimal (washing machine was broken when we were there)."

The house was clean and Cathy provided clear guidance on check in and check out procedures. She has an adorable store just down the street - must check it out. She is very talented and appreciated her attention to detail. Must stay if in York.

Group trip","Lovely house and great find in York. The house is very spacious and beds are big. The house is extremely stylish and well furnished. My family and I were staying in town for a wedding and while all my extended family was at a nearby hotel, I heard my mom and sisters bragging to the others that our accommodations were much better lol. The store that is owned by the hosts is a minute walk from the house and we definitely recommend stopping in. We found lots of cute finds for a great value. House is right on a busy road which is good to note but you won’t find better accommodations around."
