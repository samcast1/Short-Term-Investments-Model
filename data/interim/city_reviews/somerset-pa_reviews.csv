Stayed a few nights","This house was perfect. They literally thought of everything! I will have to say out of all the Air BNBs I've stayed in they really paid attention to details and thought about what people might forget to bring and have it available. The house was nestled under trees to keep the house nice and cool, it's so close to downtown but has a country like feel to it. Very peaceful and quiet. The neighbors were extremely nice and greeted us when we first got there.The house was pristine clean, came with extra blankets and pillows, and plenty of towels and washcloths. if you are looking for a home away from home, this is it. I messaged Dan and Patti mostly about questions I had (like what was the name of thier beautiful bush by the door) and they responded quickly. I plan on staying here next time I visit family. Thank you"

The delicious cinnamon rolls were waiting on the counter for us to enjoy. Dan and Patti really provided all the comforts of home. I will recommend this house to everyone who needs a getaway and wants to enjoy the comforts of home while away from home. An excellent choice and I hope to stay again soon. Thanks very much!!"

Stayed with kids","We had such a wonderful time at Franklin Cottage! Dan and Patti were communicative and responsive throughout. From the minute we walked in, we were greeted with a personalized welcome sign for our family, which was such a thoughtful touch. The kitchen, bathroom, basement and eating areas were fully stocked with supplies and niceties, with clear instructions. The house was cozy and perfect for our girls weekend with our toddlers. We would love to stay again next time we’re in Somerset and can’t recommend it enough!"

Stayed a few nights","Dan and Patty’s beautiful, cozy rental was the perfect place to stay while we explored Somerset and Seven Springs. The house was thoughtfully decorated, extremely clean, and very home like and comfortable. The locks were secure and made us feel safe, the linens were spotless, and the house has a great amount of natural light that just makes it a relaxing and beautiful vacation space. Dan and Patty also provide board games and lists of local restaurants and things to do, and everything is just so thoughtfully and tastefully done. We hope to come back in the future!"

Stayed with kids","This was one of the most thoughtful Airbnbs we have stayed at. As many of the reviews already mention, Dan and Patti thought of everything that isn’t always expected, but you wish your Airbnb rental had…from coffee, personal guidebook, plenty of towels, a kitchen with the essentials you need and even thought out easy access to outlets. They should teach a class on how to run an Airbnb. The house was as described, a super clean, comfortable vaca cottage, perfect for our family of four! Dan even went the extra mile and showed up early Saturday morning just to shovel the snow off the sidewalk and driveway! Oh and of course the Cinnabons they left for us alone were well worth the trip. This was one of our best airbnb experiences yet."

It was a bonus to find the puzzles and a great way to decompress from a day on the slopes. Dan and Patti were excellent hosts as they communicated clearly, left some baked goods for me, and made sure I had a great experience! I would stay there again, no question."

Stayed a few nights","If we wrote down everything we loved about this home, we’d have to write a book!
The thoughtful amenities of this lovingly decorated home, alone, makes this an exceptional stay. But what was even more impressive than the hosts’ attentiveness to the needs of their guests is their dedication to their guests.
When we overloaded the electrical breaker, the host arrived to assist us within 2 mins, at 9 pm, on Christmas Eve!"

They left some lights on since they knew we’d be getting there after dark, a Christmas tree was lit, a welcome message, a beautifully decorated space, and even some cinnamon buns. We found everything we needed. They even made sure to proactively salt the driveway and sidewalk when we were expecting winter weather.
If I need to take another trip to Somerset, this will be the first place I check for availability.
Thank you for a relaxing stay ❤️"

Stayed a few nights",The cottage was absolutely squeaky clean and beautifully decorated for our autumn escape. The beds had upscale high end bedding that was cozy and warm. Our host were so thoughtful that they left enormous cinnamon buns and fresh fruit for our stay. Each evening during dinner we sat on the back porch and watched a family of 6 deer cross the yard foraging for food. It was amazing! The cottage had everything we needed. We will definitely come back again and tell all of our friends and family about the cottage. Thank you Dan and Patti for a wonderful stress free getaway.

Dan, Patti, and Bethany are very friendly and quick to respond to all questions. We highly recommend Franklin Cottage.

The nicely manicured yard is lovely with a park-like view to watch deer while relaxing on the front patio or back deck, and it's a very nice neighborhood for taking walks. Patti & Dan are excellent hosts and made us feel very welcome. We enjoyed everything about our home away from home!"

The pictures just did not do the place justice, the owner has an eye for design & decor.
The back deck was perfect for evenings & watching the fireflies.
The front patio with its quaint flower box was the place to be in the mornings.
Convenient drive to Fallingwater, Kentuck Knob, Ohiopyle State Park
& Flight 93 memorial.
Patti was so responsive, and anticipated our every need.
I have stayed in many AirB&B's but this one packed a big impact,
for a small space, that never felt small."

Stayed a few nights","Conveniently located if you're visiting the area. We stayed here because we were visiting Flight 93 Memorial and Fallingwater House by Frank Lloyd Wright. Loved that they had a binder with area restaurants and bars. We enjoyed all of our meals because of their recommendations. The house has a porch/balcony out back where we enjoyed a glass of wine. Beautiful home that is well kept. TV had all of the streaming channels. We enjoyed our stay and will be back if we visit the area again.
If you are from the flat hot south a few things to note. The house sits on a high sloping hill. The driveway has a sharp decline so you will need to set your parking brake (something we don't use very often in TX). The house has a furnace but no central air and no window units. We opened the window and turned on the ceiling fans. It was fine because the nighttime temperatures were low in late May.
Again, we highly recommend this place if you are visiting the area."

Dan and Patti have an amazing place- close to downtown, ski resorts and restraints. The only thing better than their place is their level of service. It snowed one evening and before we left the next morning the sidewalk and driveway were shoveled!
The place has a bunch of fun board games like Uno and battleship. My son and I played for hours.
The hosts were very proactive reaching out one I checked in to make contact incase of any issues. House was immaculate and very cozy
My son and I loved it and will be sure to stay here again, on our next ski trip!"

This is, without exaggeration, the finest, most detail oriented, hospitable place I have ever stayed in, and Dan and Patti's attention to detail is what makes it so great.

Stayed a few nights","We highly recommend staying with Dan/Patti's Airbnb, this is felt more like a home than a rental. The location is great right outside of a cozy nice town. The home itself was exactly as described and the hosts even offered little personal touches to make us feel more welcome. We would definitely stay in the future but bring 2 more guests with us as they have an additional room we never even used. If you need to get away and are looking in this area we highly recommend staying here!!"

They left simple but clear instructions for guests and loads of information on things to do or places to eat in the area. There are plenty of historical and natural wonders to keep most people busy for a long time. The cottage is surprisingly roomy, clean, and quite. We loved being able to enjoy quiet evenings and ability to cook our own food. The kitchen has everything you will need in the way of appliances and basic condiments. This is a great place to stay for anyone wanting to visit Somerset County or just get away. We highly recommend it."

Stayed with kids","Brianna is a very friendly, professional host. My family of 4 stayed here to ski at Hidden Valley (like 15 mins away). Her place is extremely clean and well stocked. I read other guest reviews complaining about the noise - but honestly it's a fairly quiet country road and not that big of a deal. If you want to be secluded in a cabin - this is not the property to choose. Yes the rental unit is located next to her nail salon, but we were out all day anyways and also, are totally comfortable with muffled noise. My biggest suggestion to my fellow host is consider changing bulbs to regular - not LED bulbs in the kitchen and dining room. I will send you a PM! Brianna's place is very good value, and I would recommend staying."

The house itself was clean, quaint and cute!
Brianna was easy to contact and answered all questions quickly!
She was a wonderful host!"

Stayed a few nights","The home looked as it was shown and described- but the owners nail salon is attached and was she was working all day Saturday and we could hear EVERY and ALL conversations happening with her nail clients. We contacted about the place and looking for a weekend retreat for quiet, and solitude- which we info and at night, which then was noise from the road. A simple sound proofing system could have made our stay much more enjoyable. We ended up leaving for the afternoon and finding quiet somewhere else. The home was clean, plenty of kitchen tools for cooking, no privacy (between being on the main road and having the owner working literally a door away). Was overpriced for the experience we had. Would not recommend if looking for a quiet, peaceful retreat."

Stayed with kids",The house itself was beautiful and Brianna was great with communication before check in. I can say this was probably the best decorated and cleanest Airbnb/VRBO/vacation house I have ever stayed in. The location is great but is high up in the mountains so there isn't a whole lot around. We only had two tiny issues: the TV had trouble connecting to the internet in the master bedroom and the bed in one of the other rooms was not very comfortable. Both not huge deals at all. I would definitely stay here again. Highly recommend!

Stayed a few nights","Visited with my 70 y/o parents. Nice stay and beautiful house. Brianna was quick to reply, and check-in went smoothly.
PROS:Decorated nicely. The kitchen has everything you need to cook, and the bathroom shower was great. Little touches like the coffee bar and local menu book were really appreciated. There were games to play and blankets to curl up with. Ample parking and a motion light at night were great as well. AC works well, and the house stayed at a comfortable temperature. Fireplace was nice looking.
CONS: The beds were on the firm side and we found them uncomfortable. It rained and water continued to come into the basement so we were unable to use the pool table or the basement bathroom due to concern about slipping. Also there is a bit of an uneven path to the front steps and 5 steps into the house for those with mobility issues."

Stayed with kids","This house is well maintained and you can see it has been recently updated. The house is clean and tidy when you arrive. Check- in and out is very straight
However what spoiled this vacation for our family was the close proximity to a busy very noisy road. The traffic is heavy and constant all day and night and you can hear the traffic in the bedrooms and the lounge.
There was five of us and the kids and adults who slept in the front two bedrooms didn’t get a good nights sleep on any night as we were constantly woken by trucks and motorcycles passing.
It was such a shame as the house was nice and lots of care has gone into making the house comfortable."

The only thing we wanted to mention to others staying is that the floors creak a lot, so if you have little ones you'll need to check on in the middle of the night, there is no way to avoid loud creaks. The bathtub is also very creaky which was unexpected, but didn't effect the ability to use the facilities."

Stayed about a week","This is a cute, comfy apartment on the third floor. It has most everything you will need from tissues to a cover for microwave use. It may seem strange to share this, but it highlights that this is a host that pays attention to details and your comfort.
There are lots of storage areas for items you bring along, including space in the kitchen. The kitchen has nice pots and pans, measuring cups and spoons, casserole dishes as well as adequate plates, cups, silverware etc. for meals.
Off street parking is available. The neighborhood is quiet (although we were there the week between Christmas and New Year's so it might not be totally representative). The apartment is within walking distance of some stores, a church, a playground and some little libraries."

The apartment isn't cluttered, but still has everything you could possibly need. Everything that you need to know is in the listing. What to expect: Communication with the host is easy. You will use an app to get in. There is a back--up key if needed. There are 3 flights of stairs-2 to get up to the apartment door and another flight to get to the apartment. The bed I slept in was comfortable. Plenty of hot water and pressure in the shower. Somerset is a perfect location for several nearby activities and this AirBnB was a great place to use as my base."

Stayed with kids","Extremely easy to get to, clear instructions on how to enter, had pretty much everything we needed. Great communication.
My only major complaint was the smell. I couldn’t get over the smell coming from the fireplace room so we kept the door shut. The rest of the house you get used to after awhile. I can’t describe it exactly, but just an older house smell that was very strong.
The photos also showed a nice chair set up by the fire pit and hammock swings but nothing was cleaned or set up this way. The chairs were wet (understandable since it probably rained day before) but also had bird poop on them and there were no swings hanging. After a 7 hour drive the backyard photos had me excited for my kids so just a little disappointed in that. We also thought there would be tea bags since they were shown in the photo but couldn’t find any. But again that’s extras I suppose.
Otherwise it was very clean and organized and a nice stay for one night on our way back home. Beautiful views!!"

This was a stop over on our way to Virginia so we just needed a place to sleep and shower and the temperature was cold so didn't get to use the porch or fire pit. Game room was not heated but house itself cozy and warm. Price was great but added fees were 50 per cent of our one night rent. Three individual bed rooms so especially great for more people and those able to stay longer which makes for a great bargain. We enjoyed the experience and appreciated the quick response."

Group trip","Recently we had the pleasure of staying at Leyna's Airbnb in Somerset, PA, and it was an experience worth raving about.
The rooms were impeccably clean, and the attention to detail was evident throughout the entire space. A well-equipped kitchen made for a comfortable and enjoyable stay. The bathroom was spotless, a detail that certainly didn't go unnoticed. It's always a relief to find a clean and well-maintained bathroom when traveling, and Leyna's place exceeded our expectations in this regard.
However, what truly made our stay memorable was Leyna herself. Her responsiveness was unparalleled; she promptly answered any questions we had before and during our stay, ensuring that we felt supported and cared for throughout our time there. Leyna's genuine hospitality and attentiveness elevated our experience and left a lasting impression on us.
In summary, our stay at Leyna's Airbnb in Somerset, PA, was nothing short of fantastic."

The place was immaculate and the hostess’ communication was great prior to our stay, answering my questions, during our stay, and through our departure. She informed us of local events and made great recommendations for food and activities. We didn’t have any issues but I know if we would have, this hostess would rectify any issues immediately. This is a great value for family gatherings/visits to the area. Don’t miss out on this gem."

The front porch was a favorite place to hang out and visit There was an option to have a fire in the fire pit, we just ran out of time. Perfect location for visiting the Flight 93 Memorial, which was the reason for our visit. In addition, we were only a couple hour+ drive from Gettysburg, and did that as a day trip. It was great to come back to the house that night and relax. We found other fun activities in and around Somerset, but had as much fun being at the house. Communication with Leyna was easy and response time was fairly instantaneous. I wished we could have stayed longer! I would absolutely recommend this property and host!!!

Stayed one night","Adorable, clean, homey place with lots of areas to spread out and chill! Quiet neighborhood with a sweet back patio & firepit to enjoy the yummy s’mores Leyna offers! A covered front porch to drink coffee and maybe you’ll get lucky and watch a storm roll through the valley like we did, love that! We enjoyed this little step-away from life for a night!"

Stayed one night","When our plans to stay at relatives in the Johnstown area fell through, we felt so blessed to find Leyna's place in Somerset. The price was very affordable, the check in procedure couldn't have been easier, the communication with Leyna was immediate and so welcoming. And the place was stocked with so many extras--snacks, condiments, Keurig coffee pods, ice cream bars, frozen dinner entrees, popcorn, fruit...it was such a warm welcome for our stay. We enjoyed a quiet, restful night (great bed!) and then woke up to the most wonderful view of the Pennsylvania hills and farmland. We sat on the front porch for most of the morning until we had to check out. Very refreshing! Highly recommend this home!"

-The game table was very cool to have there. I had actually been looking for an air hockey table this week on vacation. My dad and I got to play for the first time since I was a kid. That made our stay very special.
There is a smokey smell in the walls bc the fireplace. We didn’t light it. It’s def noticeable, but wasn’t a dealbreaker for us at all.

Our car broke down in Cumberland and we took a cab to the house which was about an hour away. When I called Andrea she was able to send me Enterprise Rental Car service number, and we were able to get a rental the next day. Andrea is one of the best host that I have rented an Airbnb from.

From the property, to the amenities, all the way to recommendations for dining and helpful tips about fishing in the lake and surrounding bodies of water, she was extremely helpful and focused on ensuring we were equipped with what we needed to make the most out of our experience. Quiet, serene, and private…this cabin and its surrounding area did not disappoint. Hubby and I needed an overnight getaway, and we loved every second of our stay here! We will be sharing our experience with friends and family, and plan to return! We both highly recommend Becky and this gorgeous cabin to anyone seeking peace & quiet in the Laurel Mountains! Becky personifies the very slogans you’ll find in the kitchen decor: “Be Humble. Be Kind”. She is a true gem, and a breath of fresh air. Grab your fishing gear, and head out to this diamond in the rough! You’ll be glad you did!"

The rental was fully stocked with essentials which was an unexpected but great perk! Becky was very responsive anytime I messaged her.

Stayed with kids",Becky’s home is deceptively spacious and she is an outstanding host (even provided fresh coffee - thank you!). Plenty of areas for everyone to relax and enjoy together or separately. Gorgeous lakefront location a short walk to the lift and slopes. Beds were comfy and more than enough clean towels provided. The weather was not ideal but Becky gave lots of recommendations for activities nearby (very glad we visited Flight 93 memorial as suggested). Restaurant choices are very limited so definitely call around ahead of time. Dining at the lodge was only available 12-4 during our stay and other options are a bit of a drive. Just be prepared to cook in the well-stocked kitchen and you’ll be all set! Hot tub was lovely after a few hours skiing!

Only issue we had was it wasn’t in the description that in order to use the hot tub it was an additional $75 fee. You have to click on each picture and it was stated there. We didn’t see it and found out after we had already booked. Would definitely recommend to others.

Stayed with kids","Amazing alpine lake house in an ideal location. We used it as a home base this Summer to take the kids to Idlewild Park. The house is immaculately appointed and decorated. ""Cozy"" doesn't begin to do it justice. You can stargaze on the front deck or enjoy nature with your morning coffee. You can grill on the back patio while holding a conversation with guests enjoying the hot tub. The main level is one great room with soaring ceilings where everyone can interact with one another, whether they're cooking in the kitchen or lounging in a leather easy chair. At night, there's quiet, private space for everyone.
Becky was a fantastic host who responded instantly to any questions. The inside temperature was perfect between windows, ceiling fans, and wall A/C units. Water pressure was great and ran clean. Every pot, pan, plate, dish, tray, etc. we needed was there, including a drip coffee maker (also had a Keurig). Basement level had an excellent work area. WiFi was great throughout the house with cable speeds of 200mbps upload, 20mbps down. Outstanding place to stay."

The layout of the house is perfect for a group of ten, and it's location is great. Notably, the house feels very secluded in the mountains. However, it is close enough to go shopping and enjoy visiting various sites, such as Ohiopyle and Falling Water. I would highly recommend renting this home if you enjoy the mountains, and would like to experience the natural beauty of Pennsylvania."

My wife and myself are already trying to figure out when we are coming back.

When we were going to check out we didn’t realize it was so late and we were gonna have to rush to be out on time, I texted Kristi to explain that we could be out on time but probably not off property on time, she responded immediately to let me know it was ok and that we could take our time, we were still almost on time but just the hospitality!

Stayed with kids","From beginning to end, working with Roger was a pleasure. The apartment fit our family of six perfectly. We felt right at home. The property is not far from Somerset and very easy to get to. Beautiful scenery to take in when sitting with your morning coffee outside. Roger gave us a farm tour, which was a 1st for all of us and so special.
I would definitely stay here again.
I saw other reviews mention the noise since this is a basement apartment. We rarely heard anyone upstairs walking and if we did it didn't last long.
I did greatly appreciate the dehumidifier in the basement and encourage everyone staying to empty it and use it daily; really helped with the temperature and overall moisture level so well."

We loved talking to him about the farm, visiting the Dairy farm and seeing his awesome projects. The basement apartment is spacious and immaculately clean. Roger gave us excellent recommendations for the area and we had action packed few days. One of the best vacations we have had. If you are looking for a peaceful, serene stay to get away from busy city life...this is the place. Oh and did we mention the most amazing sunsets?
Just incredible. We plan to be back in the Fall.

(The unit is on the lower level of the house, but does not feel like it due to the lighting, layout, and decorations.) The kitchen had excellent amenities for preparing big meals including an oven, dishwasher, and lots of pots, pans, utensils, and serving dishes.
Overall, the location was serene and beautiful, and it was very convenient to Seven Springs ski resort and Fallingwater, both of which we visited during our stay. Our favorite things at Tatunka were watching the bison -- up close and personal -- and seeing the colorful sunset across this beautiful part of Pennsylvania. Thanks again, Roger, for an unforgettable experience!"

Stayed a few nights","PROS - A really lovely quiet rural setting on an actual farm. Great Host who was communicative & welcoming. Comfy beds. Outfitted well with kitchen stuff & great area maps. Quite large square footage. CONS - It's a basement with no windows & a bit of a musty smell. Second bedroom is a small space with a single bed in it, which is why they've put a nice double bed in the living space. Which is all OK as long as the people in the good bedroom decide to go to bed before the open plan people, or come out in the night, or get up before. Or you can just sleep in the small single bed space."

The apartment was modern and smartly decorated. We had everything we needed. It is well set up for 2 groups with separate sleeping areas.
We were also able to tour the working dairy farm, so that was a special treat. We'll definitely go back when its a bit warmer."

Stayed a few nights","Roger was a kind, compassionate, and accommodating host and his Tatunka Trail House was a dream. This is one of those AirBnBs you're going to want to spend more time at than away from. Our apartment had everything we needed and more; a big kitchen and stove to prep meals, a huge cozy couch and fireplace to relax by, a washer and dryer to clean clothes. Roger gave fantastic advice on day trips, local restaurants, and the best trails. But it was difficult to pull ourselves away from the farm; it was curated for relaxation. So many cozy spots for cuddling up and enjoying a coffee. We watched mist roll over bison fields from the porch swing and stars sparkle against the night sky from the pool deck. We made friends with Rosie and Rocket, the most polite little hostess chicken and host cat, and they warmed our hearts every time we saw them. Roger made us a fantastic bonfire one drizzly night and Rocket came out to check on us and make sure we were doing alright. We can't wait for our next visit, we hope your stay at Tatunka is just as magical."

The apartment style unit was more than big enough for our family. The full kitchen made cooking easy. The dishwasher and washer/dryer made clean up a breeze. We stayed in the more private bedroom with extra room to spare. The extra deep bathtub was great for toddler baths!"

We didn't see Roger until asking for the farm tour, so you're privacy is respected. Though I would say you definitely want to meet Roger, very nice guy.

The apartment is clean and spacious and had a great kitchen and dining area. Because of the location (nearest neighbors were pretty far away and looked like mostly other farms), the apartment was very quiet and we slept super well. Roger was very friendly and responsive, and gave us great recommendations for the area (including the rafting outfitter we used). If I’m back in the area, I will definitely be staying in Roger’s home again!"

This worked just fine for us, but I know people often want to know how the beds are laid out. We will most definitely be back to this wonderful property that is in such a great location!"

One suggestion was a breakfast restaurant named the Country View Cafe....sure doesn't look like much, but it was one of the best breakfast's Ive had in a long time.
Would highly recommend Rogers place if you are looking for a place in the Somerset area"

If you need anything or notice anything that needs to be addressed Roger will take care of it with a thankful attitude for being informed. As a family who has allergies to deal with it is nice to be able to stay in pet free zone.
Somerset is the closest town for dining but there are other little gems to dine at.
Ohiopyle, Falling Waters and the Flight 93 memorial are within a decent driving time. If you go to the memorial make sure you stay for a rangers speech, very educational.
If you don’t want to go anywhere then stay put and enjoy the peace and beauty that surrounds you. The swing overlooking the scenic view is awe inspiring. If you want to toast a marshmallow over a nice fire that can happen too. Or sit inside and enjoy the fire place. There are nice TVs but we didn’t even turn them on. Since it is fall we couldn’t enjoy the pool but that looked wonderful too.
There are a set of stairs that you have to go up and down to get into the apartment. The entrance is very nice thanks to the planters filled with beautiful flowers and the lights were all on motion sensors so our path was well lit no matter what time of day it was.
I truly can’t sum up in words how great this experience was, you just have to go yourself.
Our 9yr old gives it a 5 star review partially due to his little bedroom being behind the barn doors."

Stayed a few nights","Absolutely stunning countryside and property! I unfortunately didn’t get to chat with Roger much because I was in the area to ride the GAP trail and was dancing with the weather the entire time. The unit is clean, well stocked, and comfortable.
It’s in the basement of the hosts home so during thunderstorms I didn’t hear a thing. Know that this also has the opportunity to attract some bugs (I had some cricket company which doesn’t bother me), and can be humid but the host is on top of that with a dehumidifier. I did have to empty the bucket twice so just know that if you’re not familiar.
There is everything you need which is a welcome change (MANY places do not provide all the essentials). Shampoo and conditioner, dish soap, a Keurig, tea pot, and even laundry detergent (I had brought my own just in case).
As an animal lover this place was a gem 💎 I was greeted by a chicken, got to observe the beautiful bison, and met their beautiful cat. You are surrounded by beautiful countryside all around and the sunsets are spectacular."

We visited on a full moon took a walk in the moonlight and saw the bison in the field looking like huge rocks sleeping. We enjoyed sitting out eating breakfast in the gazebo in the morning just taking in the cool air and the view. The accommodations are generous with a fully equipped kitchen, three very comfortable beds, a living room area, large dinning table, and beautiful fireplace. While the apartment is in the basement we did not hear any sounds from upstairs. It was very quiet. Plus we saw two cute calves that were in pens near Roger's garage. Highly recommend this place for a more extended stay to explore the many state parks and trails around. I will be back."

My husband and I enjoyed our stay, and can hopefully visit again in the future.

The housing was huge, extremely clean and well decorated and had tons of space for the girls to play and explore. The outdoor area was like a forested oasis in the middle of farm country. Really beautiful and well maintained. The first night we got there, Roger showed our girls two young calves that had just been born as well as introduced us to the chicken, cat and bison right by the house. He welcomed us to play in the pool if we wanted. He also recommend some excellent dinner locations really close to the house. The following morning he took us on a tour of the dairy farm and gave the girls a ride in his tracker. It was honestly one of the best airbnb stays we've had. I would highly recommend it for families or couples. We plan to go back when we have more time. There is a lot of beautiful country to explore, great hiking and skiing in the winter."
