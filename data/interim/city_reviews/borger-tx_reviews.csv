Stayed a few nights","I could not recommend this home more highly!! A+++
This is our second stay and I’m positive we will be back again in the future. Patricia’s home is always clean and inviting. The beds are really comfortable, the AC IS GREAT, and the location is perfectly situated within 3 blocks in all directions to our family members.
Thank you again Patricia!"

Stayed a few nights","Patricia was just an amazing no host. A few of the FPC students got this house to get ready and relax in between exams, practice, ceremonies, and graduation. She was soo nice, even offered her back porch in case some of us wanted to go after and celebrate. 🎉 The house was about 5 minutes from the college which made it ten times even better for us! Definitely recommend, very clean, so comfortable and very will located."

The neighbourhood was lovely and quiet and felt very safe (I went running a few times on my own and felt very safe)
Very easy to get to all the key bits of Borger, whether you are here for work or fun.
I will definitely use Patricia’s place again"

The home is cozy and the details in the home are just beautiful. The back patio is such a great space I really wish I was able to utilize it more but I plan to return! The owners are close and EXTREMELY KIND! They even left laundry soap- it was a perfect stay! Thank you so much for your great home and amazing hospitality.

Stayed one night","Michelle’s place is a true gem. We happen to be driving through the area and needed a decent place to lay our heads, we received so much more than that. I wish we were staying in the area longer, simply so we could have stayed a while longer. Michelle’s place so comfortable and homey. You can tell they’ve put a lot of love into this sweet property. Someday, I hope to stay again."

Stayed with kids",We had a great stay. I needed a place to “call home” for a few days to host my grandchildren. There was plenty of room to spread out and enjoy each other. There were games there which the kids and I enjoyed playing. Everything was clean and fresh and very well decorated with a blend of decor that had a warm cozy homelike vibe. We loved our stay at Big Davis.

We ended up an hour early, but they graciously let us check in early. I had to text Brant and he got back to me when minutes with the answer. Camper was really nice and clean. A/C is great…which was nice after a day on Lake Meredith, which is like two minutes away. Electric for charging boat was a plus. Fishing was phenomenal at Lake Meredith too! We will definitely be back next year!!"

Group trip","Jerod’s little cabin was just what we needed for our weekend. Luckily I was with my two teenage boys, so they had no problem climbing up to the lofts! The whole place is clean and newly remodeled; ever felt fresh and new. Kitchen and bathroom had what we needed and beds were comfy with cool, smooth linens. The cabin is right off the highway (20 paces!), but traffic wasn’t too bad and only occasionally did we hear a loud vehicle drive by. Front porch was nice to sit on in the sunshine, but the view is an empty field - I though we’d be closer to the lake. My bad for not studying the map better. Overall we were comfy and enjoyed our stay! Lake Meredith is beautiful - a hidden gem!!"

The parking was a little muddy, not an issue, just something to keep in mind if it’s raining. They had a mop and broom next to the fridge to help keep things clean though. Hot water didn’t last too long, but held just long enough for 3 guys to shower back to back.
Close to Fritch and Borger, also a 5-10 minute drive to the boat ramps. Definitely a worthy place to get out of the cold and rain after being out on the water all day."

Stayed a few nights","I was fortunate to stay here for the 4th of July weekend with a three other friends of mine. We found finding the home very easy and Jerod had great recommendations for the local area. He was very quick to respond to any questions we had and super friendly. The home itself is wonderful. If you have a small group, this is easily the place to be. You could definitely do a larger group as well. The place was spotless and the AC cranked for those hot Texas summers. We found the furnishings comfortable and it was a great spot for us to relax and unwind at the end of the day. We interacted with both groups of neighbors while there and had a fantastic time. If you want to visit Amarillo, hike in Palo Duro, or enjoy a lake day; this is the place to be. Get out of the city and check this home out, you won't regret it. The only question you'll be asking after your stay is how much would it cost to build this place yourself."

Stayed a few nights",Cute house and was very thankful it was available when we decided to come to town last minute. Tracye was a very responsive and accommodating host. Borger is not that big so we were happy to stay in any part of town. The king bed is VERY comfortable. Tracye has done a great job at creating a modern comfortable experience in an older charming home.

I would highly recommend this place for anyone staying in the Borger area. The host, Shaye, was kind and friendly. She left great instructions for our arrival and clearly communicated expectations for our stay. Super quick with communication as well, even over a holiday. I'd give this place and the host 6 stars if I could!"

The space was open and clean. Clean linens and towels were provided. The mattress is very firm which my boyfriend loved, me not so much. Definitely a good value for the night, or longer if you need. As it is handicap accessible there is only a shower, but the water is very hot and had good pressure."
