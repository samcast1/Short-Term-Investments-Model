Stayed with kids","We are a Canadian family of 6 plus grandma who stayed here for a family reunion. Location was perfect for us as we were visiting neighboring communities a lot and the house was on the edge of town making it easy to get to the major routes to visit Aurelia, Alta, Cherokee and Holstein. The place was spotless, fully stocked and so comfy! The kids enjoyed the recliner couches and big screen tv. Dan made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. There is an epic waterpark walking distance from the house - we didn’t get a chance to go to the waterpark because of our schedule and it was closed weekdays at this time of year but we would definitely plan to fit that in next time.
All in all such a comfortable home away from home and an excellent, super-responsive and friendly host who wants to give you a great stay!"

Stayed with kids","Check in was a breeze and check out was so simple! It was 3 minutes max from anywhere we wanted to go which was so nice as we had young kids, so we could always swing back to the house for nap time. The best part was they were watching the weather for us and sent me a message regarding storm shelter should we need it. That made us feel safe and cared for. Should we come back to Storm Lake, I know exactly where we’ll be staying!"

Never been to Storm Lake and it’s a beautiful lake, much bigger than it looks on the map, with many parks and even a water park. (Looked like good fishing, but we’ll have to try that on our next stay.) Didn’t have any issues at all because Dan communicated so well. Great stay!"

The kitchen was fully appointed with what we needed for our meals plus take out from HyVee and local restaurants rounded out our needs. It’s set up well for kids and adults. Only a block to great walking lakeside. Highly recommend it to others.

Stayed about a week",Dan's Mom & Pops Lakeside Place is a gem in the raw. It has all of the amenities one would ever need and then some. Close to the Lake Walking Trail and nearby to a field that afforded our active little girl dog the opportunity to chase her ball to exhaustion. We especially liked the space and that it felt like home and not like a place you just visit. Everything was clean and plenty of towels and pillows. The area was quiet and we felt very safe. We would stay again.

Examples: corn hole game, washer and dryer, ironing board, plates and bowls and even spices, lots of towels, extra toothbrushes, hair dryer, lots of extra blankets, wii and board games for the kids and much more. And it was so nice to find a place that will accept our dog.
Close walking distance to public beach that is great for kids who cannot swim. My nephew forgot his life vest, but he did not need it because it was shallow enough for him to play in.
If you are looking for some great food in the area, go to Zimmy's. Wonderful friendly waitresses and wonderful food!"

Group trip","Dan was very quick with his responses and the place was exactly what we needed. The place was spotless, a great value, very clean and felt like home away from home. I was cooking for my husband and 4 young adults and really appreciated the fully equipped kitchen and open concept. The bar area seats 4 and the table seats 4, enough room for all of us to spread out but still be in the same room. The location was close to the lake and we had so much fun playing the Corn Hole game and was my first time playing-my kids beat me of course. I would be delighted to have an opportunity to stay and Mom and Pop's place once again to make more family memories. Thumbs up for this place, highly recommend for a couple or for families."

There were some noisy neighbors, but what was really noisy was the automatic vacuum that would go in the middle of the night and then get stuck and bang on the wall repeatedly. We also didn’t like that people smoke in the hall and laundry area. It smelled heavily of smoke. It was the worst when it was cold out."

We enjoyed trying out the games, the lake view, time at the park and beach, and the local ice cream shop. It was wonderful to have everyone sit down to a family meal. We'll definitely look here first for future trips to the area! Thank you for everything!"

Group trip","5 stars is not enough to truly reflect the style, grace, ease, comfort and charm that staying at Bryant family house brought to our week in Storm Lake. It was astounding. All 8 of us travelling wind industry professionals from all over the country and world were in love with this place and I think it is safe to say, unanimously: best place ever!
Liza and Matt were superior super hosts, responsive and congenial, always there to answer any question or serve as best they can. These are good people doing it right. I hope you (reading this review) are as well because this is not merely a rental house. It's truly a family home, not sparse, nor thoughtlessly appointed, but rather, abundant, curious and it smells really good too. I could go on but rent it for yourself. You won't be disappointed."

The neighborhood is quiet~the house was stocked with everything we needed~no skimping on any of the furnishing in any parts of the home~even has a double oven if you would decide to prepare a big meal. Our whole family of 14 loved the house!!

The kitchen is full sized, begging to have a meal prepared there. And a dining table with plenty of room for all our guests to sit and enjoy.
We were only able to stay for a quick weekend in the winter. Very cozy and warm house.
We are definitely going to be staying there again when we come back to Storm Lake.
In fact each one of the group with us wants to come back to stay at that house.
Liza was a great host, attentive and communicated with us very well.
It was a wonderful stay."

Stayed over a week","The house was very beautiful and the location was right on point. I just wish her maintenance man would not have been in and out of the house without us being present. It was truly annoying to have a host calling and texting every week wanting her maintenance man to come get tools out of the house when there is two sheds on the property and then have her to text me stating that we left the house out of order is appalling. After we have paid a $300 cleaning fee upfront. In my opinion the maintenance man may have been living there. The signs included but not limited to: Food and alcohol left in the fridge when we arrived, men's clothing in the closet, and the maintenance man tools was in the house, and towels in the dryer. It was not a pleasant experience."

Stayed a few nights","I enjoyed the stay at Brian‘s house. It was fantastic, great scenery, great outdoors, and just in general the fishing there was pretty bad for us but then again we were in, but that does not take away. The fact of staying at this house was a wonderful experience. I wish we could stay there a little bit more to be quite honest with you, but the storm started to blow in and we weren’t quite sure what we do in a scenario if there was a tornado or if a flood was to occur, so we didn’t take that chance, but overall the general experience without any of those problems was fantastic. I would highly recommend anybody to give it a try at Brian’s place. Brian was a respectable host. He answered the questions I had. I let him know on some things and he responded pretty damn quick."

I didn't have mine with me but would be ideal for a bike ride. Two nearby restaurants that are easy to get to. The inside of the cabin was spacious and there were a couple of comfortable beds, even a bunk bed. There were two bathrooms with showers, one larger than the other; the larger had a bath. Very relaxing. I would chose this place again."

Fishing was a little slow and water was really choppy so...they did mini-golf, exploring, hiking, ice cream, eating, fished anyway, played several games that were provided, had a fire in pit outside- marshmallows, and hot dogs. They grilled our whole breakfast outside on the grill looking out at water!! There was Netflix, comfy beds and couches!! It was amazing! Thank you to The Shipley's, we hope/ plan to return!!!!"

I don’t usually sleep well away from home, and I sure did here. Travis is the perfect host — he is right there and super responsive if you need him, and let’s you live your travel life and isn’t overbearing during your stay. Even though Sac City is a small, rural town it has an amazing restaurant (Cattleman’s Steakhouse) and it’s such a quaint, lovely town.

Stayed with a pet","We needed a space to spread out and relax for a night while on the road. Super quiet place, the upstairs had plenty of room for the kids to relax. Everything was clean and comfortable, and Travis was very accommodating and responsive! Short walk to a really cute boutique coffee shop in town, and nice park with gazebo. Great stay, especially when there's limited options!"

The only bad part about it is that we didn’t have time to see the popcorn ball! But we are in luck since we are going to be back in the area at the end of the month and we are going to stay at This AirbnB again. We are going to make time and see that popcorn ball!! Gonna book it as soon as I get done leaving this review. Thank you Travis for providing an amazing place and experience! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️10 STARS!!"

House looks exactly like pictured!
The home is located just 5 or so minutes from the downtown of the town and easily very easy to get around! Great yard for pets!
Also had very necessity you could think of during our stay. We loved the small details like a free set of soap ,conditioner, hand soap and the towels quality was also great! They also had a map of the surrounding area and some recommendations on things to do.
This home also has plenty of privacy and is located on a quiet side street. Over all had an amazing stay and felt very welcomed!"

The wooden balcony with table and chairs provides an option for morning coffee or evening imbibing. The hosts are delightful conversationists with a commitment to preserving the town's historical past.

We had a little one with us and they made sure to offer a crib for us, there are even toys in the closets for Littles to play with.
Both stays, John has let us know that we could get in to the Loft earlier than expected. And then also was kind enough to tell us that we didn't need to rush out on Sunday.

The kitchen was clean, nicely furnished and had everything you would need. The bathroom was large and sparkling clean!
We appreciated the snacks on the counter and the drinks left in the fridge. The personal noted at the door was a nice touch. John was great with his communication, and made finding the spot and parking very easy. Directions on how to get through the doors were clear and understandable.
There is quite the flight of stairs to get to the loft so be aware of that.
John had instructions for everything on the kitchen counter and included a few local places to check out. We went to a bar across the street and found it friendly and inviting. Right across the street is a wonderful coffee shop!!"

I have been traveling for work almost 8 years and this by far and been the best experience. It was comfortable and cozy. I could walk across the street for morning coffee to Mud on Main. And every night for dinner I walked a couple doors down to Gasthaus who treated me well each time and the food was great. I even was able to read some of the many books in the cozy nook they created.
There is a nice flight of stairs to the loft so pack light. But all in all, by far the best experience. I can’t wait to Vlog it on my next episode! Wonderful"

The owners were very personable, super communicative and made sure we had everything we needed.
There are a few little shops in town - enough for a good afternoon of wandering, and a coffee shop right across the street!
The truth is though, you’re going to want to just hang out in the loft!
It’s a great getaway for a couple - go out of your way to stay in Cherokee and just unwind."

Stayed a few nights","We thoroughly enjoyed spending time at the Library Loft this past weekend. I was blown away with how cool this place is. It was a perfect second home-base with our extended family back in my hometown. This place is really, really cool, with so many great design and decorative details in the loft, making it feel like a place of vacation in itself. So many cool details to admire and a big spacious place. Extremely nice, clean, comfortable, and modern appliances. The hosts were the nice welcome basket of snacks and beverages. Downtown Cherokee has gradually changed over the years but some really great places to enjoy, and very charming to look down onto Main Street of the town I rode my bike through in the 1980's. I have stayed in a few different modest AirBnB apartment-type places across the country and in a few parts of Europe, and this place is easily one of the very cool gems of them all. Thanks for the great place to stay! ... Dave"

Stayed a few nights","This place is absolutely amazing! We could not believe our luck when we accidentally found this beautiful loft when looking for an alternate 50th birthday getaway, after our original plans had to be cancelled due to Covid-19. Not a single detail was missed - John and Mollie thought of everything. They left a personal note for us in the loft, along with several other lovely amenities that just elevated our experience. As gorgeous as the photos are, you'll still be blown away when you step into the loft in person. It is a huge, sun-filled space filled with unique furnishings, art, and books - so many conversation starters. At night, there is a lovely small deck overlooking a lit courtyard, perfect for enjoying a glass of wine. Restaurants and night life are just steps away. Check out The Book Vine downstairs for books, great wines, and eclectic gifts. Even when we sent a quick text to let John know we had checked out, he responded with such kindness, expressing again that he hoped we had a wonderful weekend and a happy birthday celebration. This is the perfect, quiet, safe, lovely weekend getaway! John and Mollie were attentive hosts who made themselves available for anything we needed, but offered us complete privacy at the same time. We certainly hope to return again someday."

The special touches from the welcome basket to the extra air mattress being all set up for our youngest just enabled us to kick back and relax after a long day of travel. The loft has a very upscale, big city style in a small town location, a perfect blend. To top it off I felt like I was sleeping on a cloud as the bed was that soft and comfortable! Only regret was that we could only stay one night!"

The loft was so much larger than we were expecting. It was uniquely decorated and it was fun to walk around and take it all in. Our host left a basket of goodies and drinks for us that was greatly appreciated and the entire place was immaculately clean.

Stayed with a pet","What a remarkable place to stay and what wonderful hosts. We were attending a funeral service in the Storm Lake area and wanted a quiet and comfortable place to stay. We could not have chosen a better place. The large, modern kitchen offered the chance to prepare all of our breakfast and dinner meals. The dining and sitting areas were also spacious, giving us the chance to really relax after the days’ events. And the bedrooms and roomy bathrooms only added to the overall sense of relaxation and ease. And add to all this the unique character of a well-kept older home. Did I also mention the mornings and evenings spent on the roomy front porch, the quiet oak-lined streets, and the calming walks we took along the lakeshore? And many thanks to Joann and Hal for their graciousness. We felt their immediate care and attention to detail as soon as we walked in the house, including the hot chocolate, teas, and coffees to the basket of doggie towels. Ada's Guesthouse is the place to stay."

Stayed with kids","We absolutely LOVED staying at Ada's Guesthouse. It was a beautiful home, clean as a whistle, full of charm and character. Our family of 4 fit perfectly! Cute little yard space for the kids to run around, semi fenced made it easy to keep some boundaries for the kids (there is a busy road near)- a finished fence would be icing on the cake. It was nice and cool after being out in the summer heat, beds were comfy, and bathrooms were fabulous and have great lighting.
Flexibility- we were in town for an unfortunate event (funeral) and the hosts were so kind and accommodating. If you need anything, or have questions about staying- reach out and I am confident they will do their best to accommodate you.
We didn't have time for coffee on the porch this time around, but I very much look forward to doing so next time- it is THE CUTEST porch space.
Tips for anyone visiting with little littles- a simple baby gate for the steps, especially the ones in the kitchen which are much steeper."

It is beautifully and comfortably furnished and decorated, with plenty of space for all of us. We especially enjoyed sitting out on the front porch with our morning coffee and evening wine. You can see the lake from the front porch and are very centrally located for everything in town. Joanne was a wonderful hostess - quick to respond with answers to our questions. I can't recommend this rental enough. We would love to come back and stay again someday!"

We enjoyed coffee each morning on the front porch swing, with its lake view and shaded by gorgeous trees. Ada's is just a block or two from the lake itself, and an easy walk to several good coffeeshops and restaurants, the historical society and museum, and more.. Thanks to Joanne for making our stay so comfortable and relaxing!"

Not only is the house fantastic, but the location is as well. A short block and a half from the lake and the biking and running trails that go through the various parks along Storm Lake. Also, within easy walking distance to the University, as well as the downtown Storm Lake business area with restaurants and shopping. I wholeheartedly give this house my highest recommendation."

Stayed a few nights","Joanne & Hal are definitely superstar hosts. Joanne has curated antiques to fill this recently remodeled home. All three bedrooms have quality mattresses & linens. The newly bathroom with the claw foot tub was built in such a way you would believe it was always part of the original construction. We loved the added little touches like Epsom salts and a little bench to set a book or glass of champagne while relaxing in the very hot tub with plentiful hot water. The different sitting rooms took us back in time, although we primarily used the TV room with super comfy high quality leather couch. The kitchen had everything we needed including a coffee grinder. We cooked several meals and Joanne has thought of everything. We Californians are so used to BBQ’ing we asked for a BBQ and they supplied it with an hour’s notice! Everything was absolutely perfect. The view of the lake from the porch was a great delight even in the frigid temperatures. This will be our 1st choice in Storm Lake!"

This is my 3rd time visiting Storm Lake, and I will say this home was the best stay so far, much more privacy than any other hotels around the area and it allowed for quality time with friends and family.
Thank you Joanne for the lovely stay!"

There were clear instructions on how to get to places to enjoy in the area but mostly we enjoyed fellowship in the home playing cards, cooking together, and just relaxing watching television!

Our favorite two things about the house are the inviting front porch where we spent several hours, and the amazing location. We walked to the lake and to downtown several times.

It was better than any hotel option in town. We used the house for a group of girls from work to attend a training but every one of us left saying we want to come back with our family’s and stay for a weekend getaway!

Stayed a few nights","Jeremy’s place was very comfortable for the most part. It’s an apartment in part of converted old house so not everything is in a place where it was originally intended. While the living room and kitchen were very spacious with very nice woodwork, the bedroom also served as the laundry room. This wasn’t a problem but made the room a little crowded. The queen bed was very comfortable though. The bathroom was a little makeshift but usable. The sink was as supported by a stick, which made me a little nervous about what would happen if it accidentally got kicked. Hopefully this is a temporary solution. The shower is in a claw foot bathtub with a shower curtain around it and felt a little claustrophobic, but it works. Jeremy was very responsive to my questions."

I personally loved the fact that Veronika (co-host) was considerate and made sure we didn’t need anything. Accommodations were met! Flip side - this may not be bothersome to others but, one thing I would suggest is black out curtains for the master bedroom; the lights from the parking lot lit up the room at night and it was pretty bright waking up in the morning. Other than that, no complaints and we would definitely stay here again!"

I only have 2 relatively minor suggestions regarding the main bedroom. I would prefer to have a larger bed since this will likely always be used by couples. I believe the one that's there is a full and a queen or king would be best. Also, adding dark curtains in that bedroom would be great since it gets a lot of early morning light. These are not a deal breaker for me, just nice to haves.
You won't go wrong renting this great little condo for your stay in Storm Lake."

Overall, we loved being able to come and go as we needed, with clear instructions on city rules for street parking between 3-6am and to park in a lot nearby. I'd recommend staying here as a weekend getaway, though please note there are a few stairs to go up and down and that was okay with us"

Would 10 out of 10 recommend working with Jeff and his AirBnB."

Jeff was responsive to all my needs and was a great host, just wish I could have enjoyed to more during the warmer months! So convenient, right on the shores of Storm Lake, you will definitely enjoy your time at the BBC!!!"

It's close to grocery stores so we ate a majority of our meals at the house. Everything was there to cook with. We went to the water park for a day, which was a lot of fun. We had a great time there!"

Stayed a few nights","A few friends and I that were stationed over seas together wanted to find a place we could get together once a year, we decided to have our first annual get together at the BBC. We were allowed to check in early which was nice, but upon arrival the cleanliness of the house was questionable. The bathroom did not seem very clean, especially the toilet, and the recycling was over flowing in the kitchen. Otherwise the house was fairly decent and the views of the lake amazing. What made us decide to not ever stay at the BBC again was actually after we left the house and received a call from Jeff wanting us to replace a couple bottles of alcohol. We were under the impression that anything consumable was for community use, and we left food and drinks as well. Had the bottles been full we would have replaced them but all of the bottles 1/3 full or less. I felt it was really tacky to ask us to replace bottles that were not even half full, maybe that is just me."

The rooms don't have a ton of decor which was really handy with a pack and play along! Check in was easy and everything worked/was clean. It's an older home, not trendy, but we loved it and the price was comparable to local hotels but with more space. Totally would stay here again!"
