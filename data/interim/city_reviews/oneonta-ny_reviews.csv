Stayed a few nights","What I liked best about Frank's apartment was that it was not large, it was clean and it was easy to maintain. He has exactly what the space needs which makes general pick up easy and check out a breeze. As a host Frank always answered my questions in a timely and friendly fashion and his instructions on how to find the house and check-in/out were easy to follow. We really enjoyed our stay at Frank's ; it was the respite we needed from a hectic wedding weekend and it was a cozy spot to stay at during the winter storm that decided to hit the area during our stay. I will definitely stay here again when I'm in the area."

The outside is like having your own personal park with a waterfall, pavilion and fire pit. It’s beautiful and such a great place for a team dinner!!
The hosts are amazing and responsive, helpful, friendly and knowledgeable about the area.
This is the best rental!!!"

It is a ground floor unit with another right above. The hosts were responsive and so willing to help with anything we needed. They even left snacks and coffee! The location is private - less than 15 min from All Star Village! If we had another player coming to Cooperstown, we would absolutely stay again!! Thank you so much for being so helpful and answering all of our questions! And thanks for the ice ;). You are incredible hosts!"

Stayed a few nights","My son participated in the Cooperstown baseball tournament that is just 30 min away from this property. We decided to stay in this beautiful home and it was the best decision. It is located up in the mountains, so do prepare yourself for some curves driving up, but it is worth it. You walk in and you feel right at home, the beds are very comfortable, spacious living room, and the hosts were very helpful, friendly and quick to respond to any questions we may had had. The view would make you want to drink your morning coffee in the front porch every day. Stores were just a short drive away, and I recommend to try the local stores and try the local milk and cheese products, best I've ever had.
The small waterfall on the property is definitely the cherry on top, you can relax to the sound of the water falling.
We also went hiking on the Audubon bird Sanctuary that is just 3 min away from the property. Overall, we were very pleased with our stay."

The apartment was conveniently located on Main Street so everything was within walking distance which was perfect. From the bright natural light to the comfy beds & furniture, it was perfect. This Airbnb is the best stay in Oneonta, hands down! It feels like you are being transported to another part of the world the moment you step inside.

Stayed a few nights","Very convenient location for a short stint in Oneonta. Located right in the middle of downtown with walkable access to restaurants, cafes, shops and bars.
It is truly a beautiful space with nice design touches. I loved the look and feel of it.
Jaclyn was quick to respond to our question too. Very clear instructions were left on the kitchen counter.
A few considerations if they matter to you:
1. Bring your own shower soap and shampoo, it’s not provided in the bathroom. The towels are also stored in only the interior bedroom.
2. The bedrooms are right next to one another and while separated by an interior window with curtains, it’s not very audibly private.
3. The bedroom closest to the exterior window can also be noisy depending on nightlife/early morning garbage trucks.
4. When taking the trash out the back door, it will lock behind you and the only way to get back in is to circle the block to the front entrance."

Stayed a few nights","4 of us were in town for a friends wedding. Initially we were going to do the hotel a few doors down but that would have been more expensive and not as comfortable. This place is lovely- the decorative items are thoughtful and not at all kitschy. There are plates, utensils, pots and pans. The appliances are brand new. There’s a workout room, which I didn’t expect. A couple doors down from Latte Lounge, Tino’s Pizza, Green Toad Bookstore, Serenity Hobbies and more. Down the road is Autumn Cafe and Shakedown Street. Parking is the only drawback but that’s due to the towns weird parking situation and didn’t detract from the quality of our stay. Will definitely stay here again in the future!!!"

I have to say that this place was amazing! Having spent a lot of time looking for lodging, I’m 100% comfortable to say that this is definitely by far the best lodging available in Oneonta.
My son was at All Star Village for baseball, which was an easy 8-10 minute drive. The place is spotless, newly renovated, beautifully decorated, and super comfortable. The Latte Lounge next door had coffee on par with the local Seattle coffee shops I’m used to and it’s sandwiches are better. Tino’s Pizza was fantastic, as was the Thai place on the corner and Big Al’s BBQ up the street. The Main Street location had character and historic beauty.
Highly recommend!"

One nit is parking is not on premise but rather street parking (and depending on how close, subject to time limits). To be fair, it doesn't seem like the town is aggressive about ticketing but YMMV. Regardless, we had an enjoyable stay in this loft."

Enjoyed being downtown went to Latte Lounge and Tino’s each at least three times. About 20 min from Cooperstown tournament- acceptable distance for us to have a beautiful getaway from the ballpark. Host so nice and responsive- went above and beyond. Nicest AirBNB we’ve ever stayed in!"

I live in the city and staying at the loft definitely had that city vibe so I felt right at home. The loft is right on Main Street so it was nice that we didn’t have to go far for food or anything else, we had everything right under our nose."

Stayed a few nights","The Loft was just as pictured and we had a wonderful five day stay! The renovation to the Loft was done very well with comfortable furniture and great linens. I had everything in the kitchen to cook and serve, but place is not meant for more than 4 people at a time. It was great for me and my boyfriend to have family over to visit and enjoy the town. Things to consider when booking are: 1) Very steep stairs to walk up from the street to apartment with no elevator, so hard to carry a lot of things or very difficult if you have bad hips and knees; 2) The location is right in the middle of main street, so not a quiet place with night clubs and restaurants beneath with college crowds; 3) Very small bathroom, but very clean; 4) The king bed and queen bed were SUPER comfy! But the bedrooms are separated by glass with a curtain, so not very private; 5) Trash is taken out and down the fire escape stairs, but be careful not to lock yourself out like we did! LOL"

Private and comfortable location with a great vibe, conducive to creativity, where one can focus on work (or their craft). Maria brings (fantastic) breakfast in the morning to the attached kitchenette. There's an exercise bike downstairs, with a dedicated TV, while the TV upstairs is high-quality, viewable from the large, comfortable bed. All of it being very affordable, and walkable to a pizza place (right next door). A short drive brings you to Oneonta town, and approximate to Cooperstown, where I enjoyed the trails and sun."

The apartment is beautiful, and Maria Eliza tastefully provides everything you could ever need and more. Everything you could want or need is already there waiting for you. The care that is put into making her guests feel welcomed, at home, and even spoiled, made us never want to leave. Maria Eliza made a beautiful gourmet breakfast each morning (which was a total bonus and truly incredible!), and yet we had complete privacy as well. We were there to watch our son play baseball at All Star Village, which was less than a three minute drive down the road, and our friends who were staying at the big hotels there and in town were jealous of us! I highly recommend this place for a single person or couple who want to be spoiled while in town. Thank you, Maria Eliza for taking such great care of us!!"

Its an oversized studio beautiful architecture and amenities- Eliza has thought of everything!! Nothing was forgotten and many surprises. Super accommodating when almost needed an early checkin for a work call and even offered to do our laundry. Breakfasts are bountiful farm to table style and quality - amazing! While attached to her home/business you would never know it so do not let that detract you. Its basically a coach house and a separate little kitchen should you need it. If you are looking for a getaway in this area look no further.

I was in town for my son to participate at the All Star Village Cooperstown baseball tournament. Maria Eliza was very hospitable.
- I was by myself most of the trip, but had a guest - my son or brother - a few nights.
- The apartment was clean, spacious and airy - perfect for an individual or a couple, with enough space for an air mattress if necessary for another child. The bedding was clean and the bathroom towels were soft - refreshed every couple of days. -The TV was internet enabled to log into any service. I used the exercise bike in front of another TV down the stairs.
-The ballpark was 3 mins away.
-The best part - breakfast! Maria Eliza is a gourmet cook. Every morning, I had a made to order hot breakfast with a bonus homemade pastry.
-Room included a desk, couch and small refrig/freezer.
Overall: the best place to stay for a trip to Oneanta. Cheaper and way nicer than any local motel. The perfect experience!"

This place is perfect for a couple or single in town for the Cooperstown Baseball experience.

Stayed a few nights","Maria is a supper host! The property has a beautiful garden and lovely, private outdoor table to enjoy coffee or a meal. Suite is charming with a European chalet flare. The attention to details are phenomenal including safety features like additional handrails on exterior stairs and things to minimize trip hazards. Blackout curtains keep out early morning sun. Refrigerator was well stocked with variety of water, small sparkling rose, coffee creamers, and an ice cream treat in freezer. She served healthy and beautifully presented breakfast and a check out snack. Property was exceptionally clean. This experience exceeded my expectations and was a great value."

She is very helpful with recommendations and her breakfast in the morning alone was worth the stay. I was there to watch my son play baseball at Cooperstown Dreams park. The drive was a 25-30min scenic drive that I looked forward to at the beginning and end of the day. Don’t think twice about going anyplace else. Can’t wait to return in the future!"

My wife and I were staying here one night to visit Oneonta and Cooperstown. Its very close to Oneonta, and a scenic ~25min drive to Cooperstown. Maria was communicative and helpful, but also very respectful of our space and the desire for privacy. It was one of the best Air BnB experiences we've had. Keep it up Maria!"

Stayed one night","Maria was so helpful making my first booking absolutely wonderful. Everything looked very clean , meticulously maintained and very peaceful. I was very comfortable. Room came with an optional and delicious breakfast which Maria packed for me to take away since I don't usually eat so early in the morning. There was info for restaurants and places to visit around Oneonta area that I would have loved to check out if I had the time but I only stayed for one night. Maria runs a spa studio on the property which I was so excited to see. She was so kind to accommodate an early facial and eyebrows appointment for me before the end of my stay. I highly recommend this place, is such a gem."

Stayed with kids","I have never written a review for an airbnb but there were no reviews yet and we were so glad to take a chance on this new place. It was very private with no houses in sight. It was conveniently close to the freeway so there was road noise but that was forgotten easily by the bird sounds and the PAIR of bald eagles hanging out and eating fish by the river below. The house is higher on a bluff than I expected but the view up high was great. We experienced sunrise, sunset, rain, and fog all from the huge covered back porch. My 3-year-old and I took a walk through wildflowers, tall grasses , and gigantic trees. The kitchen and bathrooms are updated and stocked and the windows are lively with great views. Also, the host was friendly and responded quickly to a special request. I recommend the place."

Stayed one night","We stayed one night at the cabin, which wasn't enough to take advantage of all the little extra touches that the host provided. For example, the firepit was all set up with kindling and firewood, there was an old-fashioned popcorn popper designed to be used with a campfire, and our host had included popcorn and popping oil in just the right proportions for a yummy snack. The cabin was very clean, and smelled like fresh cut wood and mountain air.
I would advise future guests that the cabin is unheated & uninsulated, so you want to check the weather and make sure you have warm pajamas if it will be cold overnight. We were there at the beginning of August, so the weather was perfect; nice warm sunny day and cool enough at night to sleep well under the blankets. You will also need to bring your own towels if you plan on showering. The cabin does have electricity, and I was surprised to see that I got a signal on my phone, (which is not always the case in this rural area."

Despite being near to a road and other houses, the experience inside the home was very tranquil and quiet. I had let Annastasia know that we would be celebrating my daughter's birthday at the Southside Bungalow, and she was kind enough to leave a small gift bag of goodies for us to enjoy, which was unexpected and so kind! We had a great experience and would definitely come back and/or recommend this stay to others visiting the area."

Stayed a few nights","Overall: expensive for experience.
A couple things that could have been clearer on the listing: no running water, no space to clean up/wash face even w bottled water, $75 pet fee, etc.
Out of host’s control: our stay was booked at the end of Mar but we got caught in a snow storm which made a lot of the space unusable - fireplace, outdoor seating, etc. Rathbun Hill Rd, which is what Maps apps will suggest you take if you’re coming in from anywhere south of the camp, should be avoided if you don’t have snow chains or 4WD - and even then should heed w caution if driving on an icy night.
The place is small - w the single larger bed setup (twin beds pushed together in middle), there’s no space to stand or walk on the sides of the bed, making only the area in front of the entrance the only standing room you have indoors.
Still ok for 2 people and the host is communicative, but you can get more for the same price in the area or closer to NYC/nearby towns w more to do"

Stayed one night","Wow! My partner and I only stayed for one night but wish we could have stayed longer. The A-frame was such a cool and unique stay. Very peaceful and private, falling asleep to the sound of the stream and waking up to the fog rolling in over the water. It was a magical stay. We loved the little extras like supplies to make s’mores, card games and books, and easy directions for everything around the property. The restaurants Alyssa recommended were awesome. Thank you so much!"

Stayed a few nights",Stayed for a weekend it was everything I had hoped it’d be it gave me and my girlfriend time to relax and get away from the noise in the city the locals are extremely nice and welcoming they greet you and are just lovely to be around. The cafes in town were delicious! So good I had to return there before leaving overall a 10/10 experience we played in the lake had a fire outside with s’mores it’s was really a great time and for anyone that goes ona clear day and night definitely take the time to observe your surroundings and at night don’t miss the stars . I’m 25 and I have never seen that many stars in the sky i felt as though I could see the galaxy it sounds crazy but that’s just how beautiful the sky looked so definitely take the time out to observe it I guarantee you won’t regret it. I would recommend this place to anyone and I would for sure come back 1 day it has me thinking of buying a house out there that’s how beautiful it is.

She gave us lots of useful and interesting information, such as where to have dinner and points of interest in Oneonta. She always seemed to be there when we needed something, but she never intruded. She made us feel so comfortable that we decided to prepare a simple breakfast in her kitchen instead of going out for breakfast on the morning we left. We look forward to staying with her again when passing through the area."

Most of the time when I stay at an AirBnB, I never even meet my host. Cindy is an ""old school"" host like I used to get. She grew up in the area and can help you decide where to go and how to get there. As far as location, if you are visiting Cooperstown, it is ideal because you can get there quickly and there is a lot of cool stuff in between, like the Field of Dreams. The house is neat and comfortable and you feel right at home."

Stayed a few nights","Overall, this was a very pleasant stay. The host is very friendly, provided helpful tips about Oneonta, and generously provided snacks and beverages.
The house is nice and generally clean. However, it is an older house and has some of the creaks and quirks of an older house. I don’t want to overstate this because it was not a deal-breaker, but there was a mild musty smell in the bedroom.
Also, there were two cats. They were friendly and not a problem. But I did not see the cats mentioned in the listing and anyone with a cat allergy should be forewarned."

The room was comfortable with a working A/C and good mattress. The bathroom is a couple of strides from the bathroom. Use of her kitchen and the treats she offered were great and helpful as we ran out of the house in the morning
Cindy has a welcoming personality and has many stories to tell about the local areas and Cooperstown. We loved the chats and trivia!

Cindy was warm and welcoming, and went above and beyond when she found an activity book for my daughter in case she had trouble falling asleep in a strange house. Her two cats were excellent too! We had a lovely stay and will definitely return next time we’re in town."

Stayed a few nights","As in previous reviews, Cindy is very welcoming and a very responsive host. Her place does feel like home. I used Airbnb b/c my trip was last-minute (w/in 2.5 weeks when I first figured out I was going) and dear friends that I stay with had health situations where it was easier for them if I stayed elsewhere. Thank goodness I found Cindy's place! Love the cats! And Cindy was so engaging in chatting, welcoming to this lady who lives alone.
There was a situation where I could tell a smoker had been in the room previously. I didn't mention it at 1st b/c I didn't arrive until 9 pm my 1st night and I figured perhaps someone outside was smoking. I brought it up the 2nd evening. She immediately: apologized profusely, offered other BR (I didn't want to move all my stuff), replaced area rugs and removed chair in room next day. (I had to make sure nothing on fl.) Also bath sink was very clogged. Figured she knew b/c clog was not new. She immediately called plumber. Would definitely stay again."

Stayed a few nights","Staying at Cindy's really did feel like staying at my grandparents' house. It was very cozy and filled with holiday decorations. The holiday goodie bag was an especially nice touch, along with the delicious homemade cookies, cinnamon muffins, and Keurig! The bed was extremely comfortable and I slept very well both nights. There was also a power strip next to the bed, which was especially handy. I took full advantage of the Wi-Fi and Smart TV, both of which worked very well.
The house is centrally located (just off Main St.), and there is a wonderful Italian restaurant next door (Bella Michael's). I had full access to the kitchen and was able to store my leftovers in the refrigerator. There was also a nice variety of teas and coffees to choose from. Cindy immediately responded to my request for a later checkout, which was much appreciated. Thank you for a lovely stay, Cindy!"

The variety of spaces available for reading, dining on takeout, and communing with others—including a spacious backyard equipped with lawn furniture—is remarkable. The River street neighborhood is only a moderate walking distance from downtown Oneonta, and a couple of restaurants are only steps away. Cindy knows her city well, and can offer advice on negotiating and enjoying it based on experience. This is an outstanding shared-space Airbnb property, where the sense of being at home prevails from the moment you arrive."

Everything is spotless and yet homey. The cats are lovers and you’ll be greeted with snuggles. This is the perfect place to stay if you are looking for a genuine connection to people rather than just a bed and a shower. Very highly recommended

I was coming through for a night and needed a quiet clean place to stay and she provided every bit of what they advertised. She was even willing to park on the street because I was bringing home my first new car and I didn't want to park my car on the street. She is super giving and super sweet. If I ever needed to stay in the area again I would absolutely stay at her house.

Stayed a few nights",I can’t say enough about Cindy and her 2 sweet kitties ginger and buddy. We had room number two on the second floor it was me my boyfriend and our cat so it was a little tight but totally doable. Cindy was great and put her two cats in the front or back porch so that my cat could walk around when we got home. The bathroom was clean and so was our bedroom and there was a good size lounge office on the second floor as well that we could use. Cindy gave us recommendations on what to do and eat in Oneonta and Cooperstown. She also had candies and cookies daily which was really nice. And toiletries if needed as well. And since she knew we were coming with our car she also put a food and water bowl and cat toy for Milo. Definitely one of the best hosts I’ve had on Airbnb.

She was polite, considerate, sociable, helpful and quiet. It felt good, safe and comfortable. As a person she was wonderful to get to know. I would recommend her for repeated and long term stays as well. She makes renting easy and affordable. The location is great for traveling nurses. She near downtown and gave plenty of recommendations on food. My dogs were also welcomed in her home. She was kind and appreciative of their company. 10/10 would recommend!"

Stayed one night","If there was an Air BNB rating higher than ""super host"", Cindy should get it.
Whatever you could think of that would make your stay more comfortable and enjoyable, Cindy has already thought of it. Her house is on a beautiful, quiet street just a pleasant 15 minutes walk to restaurants and shopping section of Oneonta.
The bed is comfortable, and the room is beautiful. You have kitchen privileges, nearby parking and likely some fresh baked cookies and muffins,
At the end of my stay, as I was about to leave , Cindy asked me a question that I hadn't heard before during my frequent travels.
She asked, ""What can you think of that I could do to make peoples' stay here better?""
The only answer I could come up with was: ""I can't think of a thing that you haven't already done."""

It was tidy, but a bit tight in the bedroom, fine for a single night's stop over on our road trip. Cindy was an excellent host in that she was like family, as if she was our grandmother we were visiting, she took great care of us with local knowledge, especially regarding hiking in the woods, suggesting that we shower afterwards to eliminate any ticks... we were walking land we own, but we are not really country folks, so it was great to have her caring advice."

Stayed a few nights","My daughter and I stayed for a week at Cindy’s place while my husband and son stayed at the All Star Village. I was concerned for our safety and driving to far out of town for out accommodations, not to mention the expense. So we are extremely happy that we found Cindy’s place, value was amazing, location was so convenient about 5-7 min drive from the park, and we felt extremely safe and the neighborhood seemed very calm and safe to leave our car parked outside. Cindy is such a thoughtful hostess, she gave us many tips on what to do and see, even though my sons baseball games took up most of the time. She really makes you feel like you are home, she shares everything that she has with you as if you were part of her family. She honestly wants you to have a good experience and truly takes your input into consideration. So if there is anything that you might need, please mention it to her. Yes, she does have two cats that are very friendly, we are not cat people, but I have to say they were not an issue at all. Leave your door closed so they don’t come in and you are just fine. Thanks again for everting Cindy! Those homemade cookies were amazing!"
