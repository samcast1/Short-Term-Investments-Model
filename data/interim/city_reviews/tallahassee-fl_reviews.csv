Stayed a few nights","I’m not someone who writes many reviews, but Kelly and her place were both awesome. I myself own an Airbnb and when setting it up, i thought a few thing were most important for guests. 1) comfortable beds. 2) great AC that pumps when it’s hot and fans in all bedrooms . 3) Big TVs. 4) hot water and lastly 5) very clean. Also, I can’t stay somewhere that smells and this didn’t have a hint of any bad smell😆.
This place has it all and was perfect. My son played a golf tournament at FSUs course so being close to campus was important for us. Close to all the restaurants and bars, across the street from the stadium and better than a nice hotel. My son didn’t finish his tournament until about 3PM yesterday and Kelly was accommodating, letting us check out after so we can shower before driving 8 hours. This is a no brainer for anyone heading to Tallahassee that wants a bit more than a hotel without paying crazy money. As far as Kelly, she was as nice as someone can be. 10/10 for this place"

Stayed a few nights",Kelly was an amazing host and her condo is beautiful. Exactly as the pictures and descriptions. Parking spot was right in front of the door and door code made it easy to enter. Very close to the FSU stadium and campus. Kelly was very responsive and helpful when our first rental cancelled. I’m so glad they did as this was so much better. I would highly recommend Kelly’s condo and would book it again in a heartbeat. Thanks again for letting us stay in your beautiful home.

The apartment was beautifully decorated and impeccably clean, which made my stay all the more enjoyable. It was definitely great value for the money. The only minor downside was that the AC unit return in one of the bedrooms could be a little noisy at times. Overall, I highly recommend Kelly's place for its fantastic location, tasteful decor, cleanliness, and affordability."

Was 3 minutes from Mike Long Track and Tully Gym where I was spending the majority of my time. Could have walked there as well in about 10 minutes. This means its equally as close to Soccer, Softball, Beach Volleyball, of course Football and Dick Howser stadiums as well. Close to Jim and Milts, and short drive to Guthries. I mean as a Seminole, what else would you need. Thank you Kelly for a great stay, we will see you again in the future I am sure."

Stayed a few nights","We spent several various weeks here and when baseball season was done we were sad to leave. It felt like home to us and our dogs. The place is kept immaculate. Always clean, quiet and comfortable. We walked to the ball field daily as it was so close and great exercise for our pets. There were no noise, no parties in the complex which led to a nice experience. We’d stay here again in a heart beat. The owner is super responsive. The condo is packed with everything you need. The internet is great, the air conditioning is cool, the shower is hot and furniture comfy. I cant enough about our stay."

Stayed a few nights",This was our first time at Airbnb. And our first time traveling with 2 dogs. We liked it so much we are staying 5 more times there! It was super clean. Had everything we needed. The location was perfect from walking the dogs to walking to the stadium. The location was quiet and not a lot of foot traffic or car traffic. We’ve traveled a lot to hotels and I called all my hotel stays to cancel to stay here. It maybe a little more than the hotel stay but well worth it for all the comforts of home. Thanks for being a super host making easy check in and a great experience. We were there for baseball games. It made it super easy as a player parent to have our son swing by after games and spend time visiting. Thanks again!

I was there for 3 months and I live my life on Amazon, Kelly was gracious enough to accept my packages at her place of business and deliver or arrange pickup.
The apartment is exactly as pictured. It is well stocked with the essentials and more to make you feel at home. I wanted for nothing.
The area is quiet, even with college students nearby. There was not a lot of noise or partying nearby. There were lots of dogs, big and small, which my dog really enjoyed.
I truly enjoyed my stay and did not want to leave. I would recommend this home and would definitely stay again if the need arose and it was available."

Stayed a few nights","This Airbnb is in a beautiful location! You can walk to many different parks, and there is even a small private lake in the back.
The space is very clean and private. It has many ammentities, including books, puzzles, games, kitchen supplies, an iron, etc. It is a warm and friendly space and is quite comfortable.
The neighborhood is peaceful and quiet. I appreciate that the host included a guidebook of several restaurantes, parks, and other things to do.
Instructions are very clear and the host is responsive and friendly. Overally, I highly enjoyed my stay here and I would stay here again."

Stayed a few nights",Jennifer & Simon were terrific!!! My Fiancé and I enjoyed the guesthouse very much! We loved waking up to the sounds of birds while drinking our coffee on the balcony. The place had everything one might need (including an Iron and hair dryer) and perfectly located just a few miles from FSU. We loved the lake just steps from the house and we saw some beautiful ducks and even a Cardinal and an owl :) this Airbnb is the real deal! 💯 thank you guys very much! ￼

Stayed a few nights","I stayed at the treehouse for two work trips back to back and couldn't be happier with my time there. Jennifer was very accommodating the first time when I told her about a car issues and was flexible with the check out time. The second time, I left a pair of earrings, which she quickly offered to send back to me.
The place itself has a cozy interior that feels like coming back home. The balcony is lovely and offers a peaceful view of the wooded area in the backyard. When I checked in both times, they had everything set up and a space heater on to ensure I'd be comfortable from the moment I stepped in.
One thing I really appreciated about this room is how many electrical plugs there are. I never had to search or go far to find one when needed.
Overall, this is a really great place if you're looking for a cozy and private getaway in Tallahassee."

South of Apalachee Parkway, far enough the traffic noise is minimal, close enough to be in town in a few minutes.

No complaints. We would stay again without question."

Stayed a few nights","This is a lovely wooded setting. Instructions were clear and easy for access in and out of the space. Someone greeted us on arrival and showed us how to operate the space heater. Exterior lighting was good. The WiFi was easy to access. The place is small, but has a king-size bed and two desks. The futon-sofa is close to the bed, has a firm hardness, and will work well for someone shorter than 6 feet tall. The bed and bath linens are clean and of good quality. The hot water was an extra treat especially in the shower. Interesting reading materials and games were available and organized--we especially enjoyed the book on the history of airbnb. The weather was too cold for us to take the walking paths or to swim in the pool, but would be enjoyable in warm weather. The local co-op market was easy to drive to and offered good choices in food. The host provided use privacy during our stay. There was one power problem that the host fixed immediately and easily after we called."

This is such a comfortable, clean, quiet and conveniently located place to stay while visiting Tallahassee. We were in town to spend time with my family for a few days so it was important to choose the perfect getaway in between family time. During an intensely hot week in the area, we stayed cool inside and out - AC kept the place comfy while the pool cooled us off during the day. In the mornings we enjoyed walking for a few miles through the lovely neighborhood and around scenic Myers Park. We picked up supplies at the local Co-op shop not far from the house which has a nice selection of natural and organic groceries. So we had pretty much everything we needed during our visit.
There’s no doubt we will book this spot again next time we’re in town. Thanks again Jennifer!!"

The sounds of geese and birds filled the air - and sounds of nature were the ONLY sounds I heard! The pool was clean and perfect for morning laps. The room is spacious and has a great vibe. Clean and comfortable. Jenifer and Simon are the perfect hosts–should you need anything, you know they're there, but otherwise they leave you to yourself. I look forward to going back!"

Stayed a few nights","Jennifer’s place was amazing for our trip to Tallahassee. She was very helpful with restaurant recommendations. Her response time was almost immediate, which I appreciated. The house itself was very clean. The air conditioning blasted like one out of a hotel room. The mattress was so soft. My favorite part was the balcony. The view was amazing, and if you like views the lake view was even better. There’s even a bench out there so you can relax a bit. I’ve been to some places and there’s a bunch of debris in the pool, but her pool was clean! 10/10 experience I would definitely book again if I come through Tallahassee."

Stayed a few nights","This place is AWESOME. I cannot believe the attention to detail the host has put in. Upon entering you'll find an adorable quirky guidebook that will tell you anything and everything you need to know about the place, the things in it, the surrounding area, and even Jennifer herself! There's a bag with sunscreen and bug spray, there's shaving cream and razors, feminine hygiene, a nail kit, cotton swabs, air freshener spray in the bathroom, it's like someone ACTUALLY lives here. Nothing was left out. Don't know how to use a fire extinguisher? You will after reading the guidebook lol. You'll also enjoy local magazines, tourist brochures, and 2 nice cold waters bottled IN Florida. In the morning you'll find a dozen varieties of tea - and not your boring old Lipton and Celestial Seasonings 🙄 Someone actually knows decent tea. Bigelow Earl Grey is one of my all time favorites. There's also twinnings, stash, and yogi. The coffee is great, the creamer could be better but THANK YOU for having ANY - so many places don't? And bless your soul for having both a coffee pot and a FRENCH PRESS 👌 Living for the options. I'm from Michigan, so even in early April when it drops to 55 I can't ever imagine turning on the heater. But there's a very cute heater unit and a great air conditioner, both with remotes so you never have to elbow the hubby to fix em in the middle of the night. I actually really liked the shampoo and body wash, the water pressure was a little lacking, but maybe that's just my desire to be power washed lol.
When she said private, she meant it! The neighborhood is quiet (minus all the lovely wildlife of course! Lots of birds and frogs) and you're not sharing the property (OR POOL) with other guests.
We're obsessed with the integrated blinds LOL so cool and unique! I've never seen those before. I wanted to stand there opening and closing them for hours - but didn't wanna break em so I resisted 😂
Can we talk about the BED?! OMG. Perfect mattress, not too firm, and the pillows are BIG and absolutely to die for. I'm so picky about my bed and pillows, I've never had a good night sleep anywhere on the road, BUT I DID HERE! I'm one of those sensory issue folks that has 100 pillows and is never satisfied with them, but these are a dream. I'm about to ask if I can buy one 🤣🤣
I went on a walk through the neighborhood, it's very nice and easily walkable! In 3.3 miles (took roughly an hour) we saw 4 different parks, several restaurants and 3 bars! Lots of turtles, frogs, tadpoles, ducks and geese. We did a circuit of parks ending with World Of Beer, which had an amazing giant pretzel, burgers to die for, and a lovely sour beer! It was about 35 dollars per person, so keep that in mind. Unfortunately the very close bar The Moon was closed the day we had time to go 😭 but that just means we'll have to stop by again!
Potential cons : are you from the north? Never been to non-coastal Florida? It's HOT and HUMID. You're basically in the swamp, buckle up snow bird! (I knew what I was asking for, but for those who don't be aware haha)
Are you a smoker? You'll notice it says smoke free property and they ask you don't smoke in the room, which is great because even though I do smoke I hate a stinky room, we did however smoke on the balcony and nothing was said about it, but be prepared to bring your own ashtray or cheap bowl! Don't be a littering jerk 😤🙄 Some parts of the neighborhood seem to just not have a sidewalk or pedestrian lane? I feel like I'd be nervous walking with a stroller/little one in those areas. Though to be fair I only saw about 4 cars in total and the speed limit is 20."

We needed the heater because of chilly nights and it worked very well. She even had coffee, tea and all the fixins'. Although we never saw her, we knew she was at our beckoned call. The location was superb, in that most everything we wanted to do was just a short drive. I highly recommend her place!"

I'm sad that we didn't take advantage of the pool while we there but it sure did look inviting. We purposely did not want to cook at all on this trip, but I have no doubt we could have. The bed was the perfect comfort level for us, a happy medium of firm and soft. It was just the right amount of space for both me and my husband.

The covered swimming pool was completely luxurious, and it allowed us to have special time to swim this summer, which we wouldn't be able to do safely in public pools this summer due to covid. We are so happy we made the special splurge to stay in this Airbnb and enjoy the pool as a family. (We live in Tallahassee and stayed here for Father's Day week to enjoy a pool privately, since our child is not vaccinated and we do not feel safe going to crowded public pools this summer.)"

We were very comfortable. Surroundings were beautiful, truly a breath of fresh air for us.
there is a small balcony we enjoyed spending the early mornings with a cup of coffee before venturing out the afternoon.
the parking area with a few steps up the stairs made it convenient for us. on our last day I was able to take a walk and a peek at the lovely bench close to the pond.
we have many upcoming trips to the Tallahassee area, I am sure Jennifer place will be top of the list for us to stay.

The bed is VERY comfortable and she had lots of choices for entertainment (Netflix, ETC). I didn't swim in the pool but it was nice to know that that was an option!! I got to meet Suzanne in the am and she was totally lovely!"

Stayed a few nights","Suzanne's place was wonderful!!!
My biggest regret is that I had a busy weekend and did not have time to enjoy the pool or have a nice breakfast in the outdoor area - there is such an ADORABLE little outdoor seating area that felt truly peaceful!
There is intention in every inch of this space - the art and decor on the walls are lovely and make everything feel so home-y. I wanted to just bask in the wonder of all of the little things. It does come with a well-equipped kitchenette, and was in a convenient location. Suzanne was very clear with her communication leading up to my arrival, and even let me meet her sweet dog (after verifying it was okay with me before hand).
The walls are a bit thin, but it was completely quiet at night. Bed is comfy!
I look forward to staying here next time I am in the area, if I can!"

Suzanne was delightful and the neighborhood feels very peaceful with lots of very tall trees all around! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."

Separate apartment attached to the house had everything needed in a compact space. A cheerful spot in Tallahassee I'd surely return to if I'm ever back that way.
We did hear the family from time to time on the other side of door linked to the main house kitchen."

Stayed a few nights","Suzanne was very kind, hospitable and her suite was super cozy. Live plants, big front windows that let in plenty of natural light, and warm low-level lighting made me feel like I was a guest at one of my own family member's home - even the smell of the suite was strangely familiar to me (in no way a bad smell!). The side entrance was convenient and the driveway space provided was ample for my full sized truck. Keep in mind this is a suite that shares an interior wall with Suzanne's home, so occupants can be heard from either side of the wall. That being said, Suzanne repeatedly messaged me to make sure her and her company were not disturbing us. One night they were playing acoustic guitar and singing songs, but it was not loud or disturbing, could not be heard over our TV volume and they stopped before 8pm. I only bring up the topic for those who have not stayed in an attached suite before. We were very happy and would stay with Suzanne again! 10/10 host and living space!"

The negatives: poor water pressure, intermittent mildew smell (but the airport also had that smell, and ventilating the room helped), internet wifi signal was weak. There are very few rentals available in north Tallahassee and we were thankful this was available. We definitely hope to return."

We were surprised to find an RV parked within 5 feet of the entire length of the cottage, totally blocking our view from 2 windows and the sliding glass door.
The pictures in the listing are no longer an actual representation of the setting and should be updated. While the host recently added a comment about the RV, none of the pictures have been updated to reflect the current conditions."

Kitchen was very small and not well equipped - eg no knife.
Surprised that an RV was parked right next to windows and unit is showing it’s age.
Family warned us that there was no hot water in kitchen but since we had minimal plate.s & utensil use that wasn’t much of a problem.
Surprised that owner wanted all linens & towels bagged at end of stay - we think that is owners responsiblity."

The king size bed was so comfortable and the couch was even more so. The cottage is tucked away from the main road and is in a quiet neighborhood in Tallahassee. We had everything we needed for a nice 3 day getaway and will definitely book again when in Tallahassee.

Being able to relax on the screened in porch and play croquet in the backyard was perfect! On top of that, Jordan was ready to help out when I needed it, but gave us our privacy when I didn't. We all loved her darling cottage and her entire family was friendly when we saw them. I definitely recommend staying here!"

The heated seat on the toilet was a definite bonus in January lol.

It felt like we were a million miles away but only a short drive from necessities like stores and restaurants. The bed was the most comfortable Airbnb bed I can recall and I actually slept well, which is hard for me when traveling. One of my favorite parts is that I was lulled to sleep by the sound of crickets and frogs at the lake nearby each evening. A/C was super effective and cold (something important to me in the crazy Florida heat). The shower had great pressure and everything was super clean. Katie was also very accommodating with scheduling, which we greatly appreciated. Originally our trip was supposed to be in May, then December, and finally happened in August and each time Katie was super understanding of the factors outside my control that led to so much change. We will absolutely stay at this Airbnb again in the future when we travel back down to Tallahassee!"

Stayed a few nights","Truly one of the best stays I’ve ever experienced with Airbnb. Katie and her sister are the sweetest souls you’ll ever meet and Katie is so understanding and patient. There’s so much land, it was my dog’s paradise, also the scenery was amazing. I felt very comfortable and welcomed my entire stay. Thank you Katie! 10/10!!!"

Stayed about a week","Of all the ABNB locations we have stayed at, this host and location were head and shoulders above the rest! Katie was very flexible when I arrived much earlier than she was expecting and she handled it like she has been doing this for many years - although I was her 11th guest! Her Border Collie Izzy met my dog & I when we drove up and she was as hospitable as Katie. Katie's sister Maggie lives on the property also and she was great - made us feel welcome the whole time. I can't say enough about the property - after recently losing my wife of 55 years, this place was exactly what my Goldendoodle Stella and I needed to unwind from the past 4 years of her illness. I can't wait until we come back to Tallahassee so we can book again!! Fantastic host(s) and location! Didn't know we could stay in such a place....unbelievable. Great job Katie, Maggie, Izzy, and Mom! Miss y'all already and I just left today....❤️"

Stayed a few nights","We go out of town a lot and I have to say Katie’s cabin has been our favorite so far. It’s a beautiful cabin, extremely comfortable and clean and the surroundings are beyond gorgeous. You feel like you’re way out in the country while still being 10 minutes from the city. Can not recommend enough for folks staying in or around Tallahassee. We will definitely be back."

Stayed a few nights","This is a hidden gem and Katie is the best host I have ever had the pleasure to work with. Katie's hospitality is one of a kind. The property is tiny house about 20 minutes or so away from FSU. It is on a family property and has everything you need for one or two people. The property is on a lake - it is quiet and peaceful. I really enjoyed my time there. The only negative might be the internet speed - but frankly Katie was prepared for that - offering a standalone hotspot if needed. I was able to work from the hotspot on my phone for a few video meetings I needed to do. The property was exactly as described.
This is a very nice property and a superstar host. I will stay here again if it is available. I thank Katie and her sister for their hospitality and kindness."

Stayed a few nights","Katie’s Cozy Cottage is probably the top 1 or 2 AirBnB’s we’ve rented. It was the perfect size for us (2 adults and a big dog, too!). Beautifully decorated for comfort and a bit of whimsy. With windows on all sides, lots of natural light and the lake-facing porch was a perfect landing for early morning coffee and pondering. Great open space to let the dog run free a few times. Everything we needed, plus things we used and didn’t know we needed. I needed a hand mixer to make a promised Easter dessert and asked ahead if there was one in the cottage as I could bring one if needed. No problem was Katie’s quick reply - I’ll leave you mine to use. So helpful! From the minute we turned onto the gravel road I was smitten. And then the lake. And calves and cattle. Anhinga lakeside. Early morning prancing deer. Thank you Katy for an amazing stay. We’ll be back."

Stayed over a week","Katie's tiny house is a hidden gem just on the outskirts of Tallahassee. It has all of the benefits of a quiet rural setting, yet just minutes from the hustle and bustle of town. I felt very safe my entire time there, and you will never forget the view from your front porch. Katie, and her sister Maggie who lives on the property as well, made me feel welcome and right at home. you will also get to meet Izzy the Wonder dog who is always up for a game of fetch ( except that she always runs home with the ball after fetching it). 🙂 Katie is right next door if you need her and she was so helpful with any minor issues that I had. The tiny house had everything I needed for a comfortable stay, a well-appointed kitchen, a comfortable bed and mattress, huge smart tv, wi-fi, and a private bathroom. This was a five-star stay for me."

Stayed about a week","I visited Tallahassee to see my daughter and grand daughter. Katie’s cabin was clean, quiet, and larger than I expected. I wanted a place that felt rural but was still just a short drive from my daughter’s apartment. Katie’s location and surroundings were perfect! I loved watching the sunrise and sunset from the porch. Sunset over the large pond/small lake was especially beautiful. I saw Great Blue Herons, Bitterns, Anhingas, and Great White Egrets, Red Tail Hawks, and watched a Seallow Tail Hawk catch fish from the lake.
My grand daughter loved coming by and seeing the longhorn cows across the lake. It was too chilly to try the kayaks, but hoping for another visit at a warmer time. The cabin had everything I needed and the best equipped kitchen of all my BnB stays to date. Katie answered texts quickly. Her home is right next door, but the cabin is situated so that there is a good sense of privacy. Highly recommend."

Stayed with kids","Although Julia was responsive and apologetic, her place smelled like smoke. She, at first, seemed not to believe us, and then when the customer from the night before us said it smelled like smoke too, she apologized. But no discount was offered and we would have stayed elsewhere had we known it would smell like smoke. I am writing this review a week later so plenty of time was given for Julia to give us some of our money back. The neighbors were also loud, bass was heard throughout the night. The neighborhood didn’t feel safe. I would not recommend staying here."

Group trip","Richard was great at communicating, the house was very clean, organized, and comfortable. A lot of thought went into making sure every guest had a nightstand, lamp, dresser, and comfortable bedding. The Hummingbird House can easily accommodate 2 families with room to spare. This house is strictly a rental. You won’t be staying in someone’s home with their food, trinkets, or clothes in your way. Richard also recommended Chef Alicia to us to cater our daughter’s FSU graduation dinner. Having the meal prepared and ready to eat when we walked in the house was the way to go!!! Delicious food, beautiful table setting, attention to detail, and no waiting in long lines in college town. Richard also recommended a nearby park/preserve for us to go walking. This was by far the best airbnb experience we’ve had, especially in Tallahassee."

Group trip","I can't say enough good things about our stay at Richard's house! From his flexibility on the number of people we had in the house, to his fantastic and immediate communication, to the cleanliness of everything, to the quiet neighborhood, abundant driveway parking, and OH, the fire pit! I appreciated the little things: nightstands and lights at every bed, nightlights in the hallways, dish and laundry soap and garbage bags available, plenty of seating. Even the hot water heater held up against 20 people.
Everything (appliances, wifi, electrical; even the automatic-closing curtains) worked, the house was close to shopping and dining, and just 15 minutes from FSU and FAMU.
It was amazing, and perfectly suited our large group's needs.
We will be back!"

Great place for a large crowd with tons of space that is VERY hard to find in Tally. It's been recently renovated, has 6 bedrooms (3 rooms had 2 double beds). Also had 2 living rooms & 2 full kitchens (upstairs and downstairs), and 3.5 baths. There was an awesome wrap around deck and huge back yard with fire pit. Plenty of space to spread out and hang out. Highly recommend. We will be back for sure. Just hope it is available next time we book if the secret isn't out."

Stayed with a pet","Thank you Richard for letting our large family stay at your lovely property.
It was so peaceful and I liked that it was in a cul-de-sac, made it easy to walk our dogs around in.
Our dogs also enjoyed playing with each other in the large back yard!
The view of your backyard from the upstairs outdoor rap around patio was also very nice and the great weather made it even more enjoyable!
The beds were comfortable and it was great that your kitchen was so big, so that a few family members were able to prepare and cook in it at the same time.
Having the ramps in the back, besides the stairs, to go up and down to the first and second levels and to the driveway, made it much easier for a family member with her handicap stroller.
They also loved having the small bonfire and making s'mores!
It was also very close to FSU which made things quicker!
We hope to visit again in the future!
Sincerely, Lauraine"

We all loved the home. My eight year old loved the split level and the massive and soft sectional. I adored the ample space everyone had to grieve in their own way. My mother in law loved the outdoor space. And we all agreed that the interior design was fantastic. It was a wonderful stay and if we return for any reason, I must stay here again. The host was very nice and responsive and understanding of our situation. After each event we attended as part of the funeral, I looked forward to going back to this home. My only regret is that we didn’t stay an additional day!"

The house is two-leveled living and each level is so comfortable, accommodating, and homey. We had a great weekend, nestled in the trees and yet close to FSU, Wakullah Springs, and The Rez. You will be close to everything but in a quiet neighborhood where you are sure to enjoy your stay in this lovely mid-century home!"

It allowed us enough space to spend time all together while allowing everyone to slip away for some alone time when they needed it. Richard provided baby gates, a pack n play, baby soap, kid friendly plates/utensils, etc - all of which was a great help! Three of the bedrooms have walk in closets, which served as dark bedrooms for the youngest babies.
The house was clean, quiet, safe, and had a lot of things that made our stay enjoyable. I would recommend booking!"

This home is in the perfect location (quiet beautiful neighborhood with respectful neighbors). You will have access to every store (Aldi, Publix, Walgreens, Trader Joes, etc) you need and the FSU campus. The park within walking distance is gorgeous, and is a surprise added bonus for your large group to explore and dine. The home was equipped with anything you needed to host, super clean, and had non-toxic cleaning and laundry supplies.
This is one of the best Airbnb experiences I have had, other hosts should take note. Thank you Richard for such a great experience and welcome to Tallahassee!"

Stayed a few nights","We loved this house! We hosted a graduation party with guests ranging in age from 21-86! The house more than comfortably fit our 12 guests. Grandpa was able to relax in his room and watch westerns when he wanted to, the grandmas enjoyed the private screened in porches for talking on the phone, our 20-30 year olds loved the lower level suite with full kitchen and the deck was perfect for listening to music and having multi-generational conversations. The exterior is deceptive as the interior is wonderful. Luckily, the Tallahassee weather cooperated as well. Also, it’s centrally located so quick trips to grocery stores and FAMU.
We paid a premium given graduation weekend, but the value was much better than the equally inflated hotel prices. Great hosts! Great house!"

I highly recommend staying here if you’re in town. We watched our FSU Seminoles win and had no worries coming back to the Airbnb because of how easy and close it was. Every time I’m in Tallahassee I’d define I’ll try to stay here. Airbnb was everything and more!"

I had to last minute plan for an Airbnb DURING HOCO WEEK, and not only was I accommodated, but the cost was beyond an affordable price compared to the surrounding areas and definitely gave “5-Star”experience! I felt right at home! My favorite part of the house was literally EVERYTHING! The interior design & decor was awesome! Beds extremely spacious, and comfortable! This will be my “Go To”spot for family & friends visiting into town for sure!"

I counted 19 ships in the decor so if you’re into boats this is your place😉 5 dressers so no shortage of space. The only downside were- skylights (bring an eye mask if you’re sensitive to light or wish to sleep in, and the bed could have been a bit comfier for us (we have sleep issues🫤). Overall a lovely stay and glad we chose it!"

So enjoyed the sailing ship motif, comfy bed, stylish space, lovely shower, and especially sitting at our poolside porch with beautiful views of majestic trees, numerous flitting butterflies, and daily visits from your 3 sweet, adorable, canine welcoming committee! A mega bonus: Due to being removed from the light pollution of the city, we were also able to enjoy some wonderful clear skies and fabulous star-gazing! If and when we pass this way again, this will be our official ""nest"" in Tallahassee! Thank you, Jennifer, for all the love, thought, and care that went into creating this warm, welcoming, lovely space!"

Stayed a few nights",I had a very relaxing 3 day stay in “Captains Quarters” The interior was clean and comfy. Every thing you could possibly need was available. I really really enjoyed breakfast on the patio and the beautiful pool. It was the perfect place for R&R !!! Jennifer and the pups were very friendly and welcoming. I definitely would love to come back and enjoy this amazing space.

It is sparkling clean and (important to me), smells very fresh. Jennifer is a warm host who truly understands what it is to provide exceptional hospitality. The space is gorgeous, the bed very comfortable, the walk in shower is wonderful, and the pool area is like being at a five star resort. The kitchen has all you need to store food in a mini fridge/freezer and warm it up with either the microwave or toaster oven. There is also a Keurig. There is a nice laundry room with new full size washer & dryer as well."

When you first walk in you could hear the other guests walking into the foyer but you can’t hear anything coming from the other rental although when I went, it was raining and very cold. The pool area is very beautiful to look at, wish I could’ve got in. The yard is very beautifully kept. They do have pets that come out and I think their cats are outside all the time because there was a couple of cats outside, but it didn’t bother me any the area is very nice. I was very comfortable and I was able to extend my rental one more night with no problem will definitely rent again"

The location was perfectly tucked away in the woods, and in very close proximity for a wedding at The Retreat—our reason for visiting this past weekend. I wish the weather had been warmer so we could have used the pool because it was definitely tempting! The place was SUPER clean (and I usually am very critical of this detail in particular). The shower was so great, and there was plenty of space for luggage and personal items. I loved the coded door entry. It made coming and going super easy, and we were very appreciative of the carport for parking. We’ve already decided we’ll be staying here again for our next visit."

There were minor drawbacks, but nothing egregious . The freezer portion of the mini fridge doesn’t work & the only sink is in the bathroom. There isn’t many plugs near the bed either.
Overall, I had a splendid stay. I’m familiar with this area, but if you’re not please be extra careful when driving down the main road, especially at night."

Stayed a few nights","Captains Quarters is one of the top Airbnb places we have stayed. Jennifer , Paul and her 4 dogs are great hosts. The apartment is very clean, comfortable and inviting. Parking is covered, and guest entry and apartment is separate from the main house. Comfy bed, fabulous shower & bathroom, microwave, kcup coffee maker, toaster oven, small refrigerator, and Roku TV make this a complete set up. Direct access to the pool patio was great and you might even get a visit from the resident dogs who are very friendly. Jennifer and Paul are very accommodating and we enjoyed talking with them. Don't hesitate booking your next Tallahassee area stay at Captains Quarters."

Stayed about a week","I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Captains Quarters. Jennifer was a kind and friendly host and very thoughtful to make the guest experience as pleasant as could be. It was so nice to have the carport to park in also. Very pleasant decor, comfy bed, great shower. The Suite felt even bigger than the pictures show. Nice property and neighborhood.
Completely safe and secure. I would definitely stay again! Great Airbnb experience."
