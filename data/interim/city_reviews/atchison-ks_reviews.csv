The outdoor patio furniture and dining table inside were perfect for playing games. The place was very clean filled with oodles of supplies. We would definitely choose this again as a place to stay when we visit.

Stayed a few nights","What a wonderful spot for the weekend!Our expectations were very much exceeded! The beauty of the landscaping was matched by the architecture of the house, outside and in. Little and big touches abound inside and out. From the parking, the gravel walk to the property, the deck with a grill and a nice place to sit and enjoy the quiet neighborhood. A well appointed kitchen, with some nice snacks, granola bars, fresh blueberry muffins and bananas as well as several selections of coffee and tea. Some yogurts in the fridge and eggs plus a great selection of condiments. Of course, pots and pans, nice silverware, that's just the kitchen!
Nice dining area if you didn't want to use the island with stools in the kitchen.
A comfy living room with smart TV and some subscription services available, chocolates here and there added to the nice touches. CD player and sound system as well as a selection of vinyl records. All 3 bedrooms also have the same setup television wise.
The bathroom had heated floors! A nice shower and sink as well as little things such as razors, mouthwash, etcetera, in case you forgot something.
All in all, a fantastic spot! Our favorite stay in quite a long time.
Alan was a wonderful host, communication was great and we felt well looked after without feeling looked upon. A great AirBnB experience.
Thanks Alan!"

Stayed a few nights","This is one of the best Airbnb experiences I've ever had, and I've had many. The house was cheerful, user-friendly and comfortable, but what made this place rise above was the combination of Alan's warm and welcoming hosting and the more-than-generous kitchen staples, toiletries, treats, and other supplies for guests to enjoy. Every surprise at this property was a delightful one (including the hilarious sheets in the Pink Angel room). I'm already looking forward to my next stay."

We had some good food in town, visited the Amelia Earhart Museum, walked campus a bit and went to the International Forest of Friendship on a beautiful January afternoon.

No comfort spared in a lovely remodel that saved notable features of the old house.

We loved the well-stocked and beautiful kitchen (we do a lot of cooking!); washer and dryer; heated bathroom floor; books, games, and movies; back yard; and front porch. Things were labeled, which in some places can seem stuffy or suspicious, but here it was helpful and even hilarious. We appreciated the snacks, the card, the in-case-you-forgot baskets, and all the small things Alan did to make this stay above-and-beyond comfortable and enjoyable. I loved how his personality shone through, even though we didn't meet him. I would go out of my way to stay here again with my family of 4, even when our business is 30 minutes away in St. Joseph."

We were even greeted with a hand written note and cookies! Alan was super communicative and quick with his replies, which made booking, check in and check out a total breeze. We will definitely be staying at the belle again! ❤️"

We have stayed at a lot of Airbnb’s and this home by far had the most extra touches. There was food in the fridge for us. And any toiletries you forgot, he had them. We had a wonderful time and hope to stay again soon. Highly recommended"

Group trip","Our family was going to Snow Creek for a weekend so I found Alan’s place that was close by and WAY cheaper than others in Weston. The pictures looked nice but they do not do this place justice. Such a cute house, everything that you could think of that you might need Alan has it available. He also texted to check in our first morning to make sure everything was ok and to see if we needed anything! Hands down the best host that we have ever had at an AirBnB! If you’re on the fence, take our advice and BOOK IT... you won’t be sorry!"

Room to spread out but enough room for family dinner at the dining room table with a leaf built in! Beds sleep well and TV in every room make it so comfortable. The outdoor spaces allowed us to have a cookout for BC kids and feed a small army who wanted home cooking. The kitchen and it’s top of the line appliances allowed us to cook up some special family dinners. Alan had fresh cut flowers in every room and it made you feel so cared for . The fun and whimsical Halloween and fall decorations were fun And made us feel like Alan enjoys life and the “Belle” wants you to enjoy life also!

Stayed one night","You can expect a welcoming host providing a “home away from home” atmosphere — “The Belle” is an absolute gem! Alan is a thoughtful and responsive host with a spacious home for a small group, very clean and very comfortable. Alan contacted us in advance regarding the check-in / check-out process and provided detailed instructions.
Our travels took us to KC for a girls shopping trip with a pit stop overnight in Atchison to visit our BC student. We stayed in KC longer than expected and didn’t get back to Atchison until after 10pm — Alan was concerned about not leaving the porch light on for our late arrival and reached out to have a neighbor put the lights on for us! He even offered for us to plan on a later check-out since we were getting in so late! We enjoyed our morning coffee on the deck and the last of the summer flowers still in bloom in the lovely backyard!
Another great Airbnb experience and pleased to provide a 5 star review for our stay at “The Belle” — we highly recommend and will definitely stay here again!"

It has all of the kitchen essentials you will need to enjoy meals together and very comfortable beds. We would stay here again 100% it was very comfortable and I recommend it highly! The host was very accommodating and friendly. I was nervous about staying out in the country which seem to be far from town but it was the complete opposite very convenient and just far enough away from school. We made many trips in and out of town and it was very easy to go back-and-forth from the college and downtown Atchison up to the farm.

Stayed with kids",Susan was a very gracious host and very informative. The house was immaculately clean and organized. My husband and my family loved the stay there. It has such a relaxing atmosphere to it and is just secluded enough to guarantee you some peace. But just close enough to town where it’s convenient to go to the store. Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting a nice quiet get away to spend some quality time with your loved ones. Also the no wifi was kinda a plus it made my family come together more to do activities with each other that didn’t include electronics. Definitely allowed us to have some good quality time in a beautiful home. Thank you so much Susan ❤️

It was difficult to find the place as Apple Maps doesn’t lead you to the right house but the address number is correct and take a right instead of a left on the final road to the house! Totally worth it and would go back for sure

Side note- there were two loose dogs that came up to the house. A husky and a lab mix. They seemed alright. My dogs don’t really get along with other dogs so I quickly brought them in. Just a heads up- neighbor dogs roam. :)"

Group trip","If you are looking for some solitude this place is perfect. The Farm house is clean and offers 4 super comfortable beds with great linens.
Everything stated in the property description was spot on. But there were a few unexpected surprises. The charm and history of the farm also means the kitchen is dated (no dishwasher or garbage disposal.) We were aware there would ne no wifi but were not aware there would be no tv. We were also not aware that one of the 4 berooms has no heat. Being there with the night temps in the low 20s made for a few cold nights.
The solitude and charm the Farm offers made for a great place to slow down and slend some quality time together. Being able to have our pets with us was a great bonus."

It was the perfect place to spend the weekend meditating, journaling, and taking sunrise/sunset walks (and photos!). It was a level of quiet this city girl has never experienced before. We didn't leave at all, once we arrived. It's easy to find, and a mile or so off the paved road, with a long, long driveway. Gorgeous!"

The apartment looked very new and it was clean and tidy. It was nicely decorated and furnished. The house was easy to find with clear directions on where to park and how to access the unit. It was very quiet, peaceful, and private. Matthew and Hailey were very responsive and available and made me feel welcome. Matthew also recommended a couple of places to visit and I went to both and enjoyed them (Amelia Earhart Museum and the Atchison Rail Museum). Aside from the great reviews of other guests, I chose Matthew's apartment because it was close to Benedictine College where I was attending a conference. The college was only a quick 5-minute drive away, so it was perfect for me. Downtown Atchison is only a 2-minute drive away too, but the neighborhood where the apartment is located is very quiet and residential. I would definitely stay here again!"

It is right up 4th Street off of the bridge, so easy access to downtown or if you want to head out of town to Kansas City or Saint Joseph. Second, the instructions to locate and access the space were perfect. Third, the moment you walk in, it smells so clean and inviting. The decor is warm and relaxing with the throw pillow, blankets, and bedding. There wasn't anything left to need once you were there. All the amenities are present and brand new...BRAND NEW...so nice to prepare meals and do laundry, just like the comforts of home.
This is the first time I have rented an Airbnb below the main residence, so I was a bit worried about noise, both from us to them or them to us. They were so quiet...and I hope we were, too! I cannot say enough about this space. If you are looking for a wonderful space to stay in a quaint and unique town, then this is it! The price, location, and family are are all you will need!"

Stayed a few nights","The house was fine, and to some extent you know what you are getting into with the instructions about no shoes in the house. The problem was that the host is surely better suited to running a true BnB than an Airbnb. She was over-communicative so much so that I would call it intrusive. I received several messages saying things that weren't questions (like ""If you can please let me know your Check-in ETA that would be great"" and ""please reach out with any questions."") Because I did not respond to those messages or a further message that said ""Please text me when you have arrived and that everything is to your satisfaction,"" the host messaged me through the app and a text saying ""Hi there, I will need to get a response from you to ensure that everything‘s going well. Or shall I come by ?"" This felt rather threatening so I replied saying things were fine, and thereafter replied to all messages. She remained friendly despite my short replies, but definitely not what I expect in an Airbnb."

We really liked the location, ease of parking two cars, and simple entrance. The TV in the living room was easy to use! We also enjoyed the nice soaps/shampoo in the bathroom. Great layout and use of this economy space! We can’t wait to stay again when we visit our student at BC."

Stayed a few nights","LOVE this cottage!
Darla is great to work with and this cottage is so well-maintained and easy to check in and out. The descriptions are accurate and the TV room has an added couch to go with the loveseat. The Kitchen has new appliances that function great. Leaving shoes at the door is helpful to keep the flooring and grout clean and I appreciated her having reminders and slippers for those who needed them. The kitchen is nice and big which is helpful when you have several visitors to feed.
White sheets were clean on all beds and the description is accurate, one firm and one soft bed. Pillows are of varying sizes so you can find the right one. screens on the windows were in good shape which was great to let the autumn breezes in. and keep bugs out. The cottage is in a great location for BC college and downtown activities. Parking in the back and on street is helpful. Only one flight of stairs up from the street or parking. The steps are sturdy and well-maintained. Cleaning supplies were provided and handy for everyday clean up. Enjoyed the extras, like small room fans and hairdryers, and curling iron in drawers in case you needed it. The towels were new and very absorbent with washcloths to match. The TV was easy to use and the remote was easy also, without concern. Has a washer and dryer but it is outside the regular agreement and is extra to set up with a fee to use. We did not need it, but I felt bad leaving dirty dish towels at end of our stay. Plan to stay again next time we need to come to Atchison, it was great and so comfortable."

Darla's cottage is well appointed and comfortable including a back deck and front porch for some alfresco dining or board game play! Sweet slumber was experienced in both bedrooms - mattresses are firm but soft and cotton sheets make for comfortable rest. AC works like a dream - we Northwesterners aren't used to the stifling humidity!
Darla is a friendly and attentive host! We are glad we found this little gem in Atchison!

Driving up, there was initial concern about the condition but with the interior was a quick reassurance of a quality stay. It was warm and inviting, new carpeting and furniture was tasteful and charming. It was absolutely the right place for what we needed, a quiet place to sleep and a respite from lots of walking while visiting Benedictine College. East to get in and out and no fussy demands or restrictions. If it’s available if/when we come back, we’ll likely choose it again."

Wonderful and peaceful and secluded with a very large pond and heavily wooded area at the back of the house. Great to be able to use the garage on the main floor and have more parking near the front door. Beautiful flower arrangements in the house. Showers were very nice - heat and pressure. Nice that lights and other switches were labelled. WalMart close by."

The photos were very enticing and it had great reviews, so I reached out to the owner to ask if it would be okay for us to stay there as a troop because it was a large group. We had parents in the bedrooms and the scouts wanted to slumber party in the living room.
When we arrived, we were impressed with how beautiful this home was and every corner we turned was some hidden room or closet that the kids loved. The neighborhood was quiet and peaceful. Even with our large group, we were all comfortable and pleased with our stay! The hosts thought of pretty much everything when stocking the home! My husband and I had the downstairs master bedroom and I cannot believe how comfortable the bed was, I even asked the host where I could get one! I would love to come stay here again!"

The kitchen is fully stocked with pots, pans and cooking utensils. My daughter is grown but this would be such a fun place to stay with little kids. The owners have thoughtfully included toys, sippy cups and even a rubber ducky for the tub.
My parents live in Atchison. I am so glad I have a place to stay where my family can spread out without being on top of each other. This home gave everyone privacy.
It was winter when we were there but there is an awesome fire pit in the backyard with Adirondack chairs. The front porch is also quite lovely.
Thank your for being amazing hosts!!!!!!"

The kitchen has always had any dishes, pots, and pans that we have needed and they didn't need to be washed when we pulled them out of the cupboards.
They are happy to share some ideas of sites to visit in and near Atchison and they live right across the street, so they are available quickly, if needed.

Although we were in town for a wedding and we didn’t have much time to stay in and relax, they have games and coloring books as well as tv and dvd player with movies for entertainment. I loved the reclining love seat! The binder she created full of useful information (nearby restaurants, things to do, hospital info in case of emergency) is a great example of her attention to detail!

We spent our days wondering the land and saying hi to the animals. It was a perfect family getaway and my kiddos already want to go back! Tell Brutus we will come give him tummy rubbins again soon!"

The animals are friendly and love apples and meal worms for the chickens and ducks. This place is my happy place! Ruby is awesome and lives on the property. She is very responsive and encourages you to reach out if you need anything. This is my 3rd stay and I will will be back!
There are horses in the pasture up on the hill, so majestic to wake up and look out the kitchen window and see them.
The grounds are beautiful. There are plenty of areas to walk and take in nature. Birding is also a great activity so bring your binoculars!
St. Joe is an interesting town with museums and a lot of history, but you won't want to leave the farm!
Thank you Ruby for sharing you little piece of heaven with me."

Stayed a few nights","A relaxing stay at Ruby's Carriage House! It was an easy drive from Kansas City with a stop off at Atchison, KS for lunch. Ruby had suggestions for restaurants in the area but we had taken food which we popped in the oven. There was an antique store close where we found a couple of treasurers. Was celebrating a birthday so ordered one of the tasty cakes - you won't be sorry. Be ready to enjoy the farm animals. Just a note, the bedroom and bathroom are upstairs (this is noted in the description). The Spa/Hot tub area is located a short walk up the drive. While there, take a hike. Lovely woods. I think it would be amazing in the Fall. Thanks Ruby for your hospitality."

Ruby is super friendly and pleasant, VERY responsive, and will do what it takes to make you feel at home and have what you need. This is the second summer we also leaned on her for babysitter recommendations and coordination, so we could have an adult night out with friends.

We ordered a cake that was absolutely phenomenal, the chocolate covered strawberries were a big hit! Games stocked in the living room helped us pass the time and we even watched a little bit of Disney+ in the morning. Inside the house you could hear the dogs and rooster but they're not loud enough to become annoying or keep anyone awake. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay."

As true “midwestern-nice” introverts, we were a bit nervous that our presence would be intrusive with the host’s personal home being so close to the cottage. However, the cottage was secluded enough to feel private and comfortable. Our host was attentive to our needs and provided great recommendations. We loved waking up to ducks and chickens in the yard, and being able to snuggle a very sweet doodle dog every day. The hike to the waterfall is a must!! The homestead offers much to explore, and we wished we would have asked about the pillars and stonewalls that align the front of the house. I’m confident the history behind those is very interesting!
We can’t wait to stay again!"

The home was very comfortable and clean. We wish we had longer to stay because she has the best variety of books - we could stay just to read through them! There was nothing that we missed or felt like we forgot because this air bnb has everything we needed. Thanks!

We also had some leisurely swim time in the outdoor heated swim spa. I recommend Ruby’s place if you’re looking to unplug, and unwind! Thanks, Ruby!"

The walking paths were gorgeous and easy to follow—very much worth taking advantage of if you stay here. The property is gorgeous in general! We were also able to use the hot tub which was an amazing experience. The stars were clear, and everything was clean, well functioning, and very worth it :) there were even robes available for use.
Ruby was extremely responsive to any questions or needs we came across. Extremely friendly and helpful with regard to making recommendations nearby. Overall an absolutely amazing stay! Highly recommend, and would definitely stay again!!"

It was a short walk from the carriage house, but nothing too difficult (it was even icy when we went). She also allows you access to the yoga studio that we only used to dry off, but it was nice to get out of the freezing rain when doing so. You are near a highway, but traffic dies down quite a bit when it gets dark...we didn't even notice it after awhile. We'd definitely stay here again!"

Stayed one night","It’s very peaceful. Ruby has a beautiful carriage home and she had lots of extra touches such as a flashlight by the door, candles and lighters, a Brita water pitcher in the fridge, extra blankets, and lots of books. I liked having such a large house with several places to work and play, a desk, a romantic table for two, the living room with a comfortable couch.
We loved the beautiful animals. It was fun to watch them in their home whether it was the sleeping pot bellied pig - they make the most interesting snoring noises!, the chickens wandering around and taking dust baths or the roosters crowing, the ducks shaking their tail feathers. We got lucky and were able to watch the horse roll around nearly upside down and then snake himself off. The dogs are beautiful and so loving. The cats are fun to pet. I really enjoyed my little spot in the universe seeing them all in theirs and knowing they are well cared for and loved.
Ruby has an amazing house and it is all a breath of fresh air."

Stayed a few nights","This place is amazing, and it was just what i was looking for. So refreshing and restorative for my soul—pastures, animals, wooded hikes, plus a super comfortable place to stay and curl up with a book.
Ruby is such a fun, hard-working person and responds quickly if anything comes up. I utilized the exercise room and LOVED it too… the hot tub under the stars was awesome.
I was concerned about possible noise, as I’m a light sleeper, but I really didn’t hear much (with the sound machine like i use at home, too) and it wasn’t a big deal. There was a night that Ruby had brought two new calves that were kinda unhappy about being separated from their moms, and their mooing was loud. But, it didn’t bother me much, and kinda added to the experience (and plus i think it was an exception as they will be put out to pasture normally).
The only problem is that now i want to move to the country. Haha.
I will definitely be back."

Stayed a few nights","The carriage house at Ruby’s is the perfect serene getaway in the hills, with all of the comforts necessary to effortlessly enjoy your peace. Sitting outside my first morning for breakfast, I was joined by the most hospitable grey cat, a symphony of roosters & hens, & a collection of horses, dogs, ducks & a leisurely pig. Day two brought the rain, & with the heater up & movies streaming, it was all the cozy vibes.
Ruby is so very kind, & was wonderfully helpful with any questions—from nearby grocery stores to how to keep the house warm when the weather turned. I absolutely recommend a stay at Ruby’s, & look forward to a return visit should I pass through again."

Stayed a few nights","Ruby's carriage house is a charming, clean, well-kept-up slice of farm life, petting zoo, hiking trails, yoga/exercise studio and gourmet restaurant all rolled up in one! My friend and I spent 2 very relaxing days there recently. The farm animals were friendly and very comfortable around the 2 of us. Ruby, the hostess and owner, is fun and friendly, and very ready to share the interesting information about the historic property and home that she and her family live in, and the carriage house we were in. Ruby is also a master chef! We had her outstanding Indian meal option for dinner one night, delivered to us by her very gracious husband and adorable young daughter. Ruby brought over a delicious breakfast frittata and fruit for breakfast the next day. Service with a smile, both times. Lovely hosts and really great hospitality. Great coffee/tea bar. The bathroom has a great shower/tub stocked with shampoos and body wash and bubble bath. The hiking trails were lovely, especially with the fall colors, though due to drought, we were only able to see a trickle at the waterfall.
Our only complaint was that although the queen sized bed in the bedroom was very comfortable, the two alternate sleeping accommodations were not! One was a very hard twin sized futon and the other was a blow up mattress that lost air throughout the night, resulting in one of us tossing and turning half the night and not getting a good night's sleep. So, if there are only two people in your party, we'd suggest sleeping together in the bed. We'd also recommend bringing along ear plugs (we had a heads up to do so from someone who'd stayed there previously) because those very handsome roosters start crowing quite early!"

Stayed a few nights","I'm heartbroken we were only there for 2 nights! We were just in town for the weekend for a wedding and we were so busy running around we didn't get nearly enough time to explore and enjoy this beautiful little home. So sweet, so quaint and comfy. I love the reclaimed doors and all the hidden bonuses (there's a cabinet full of games). Beautiful little kitchen I would have loved to use with plenty of dishware, coffee pods ready to go, and we very much appreciated the ice in the freezer and Brita pitcher in the fridge. Lovely shower gels and plenty of towels, the tub is a little small but still comfy for a bath and the shower has a range of good pressures with different settings (depending on what you prefer from hard to gentle but consistent). There's even a washer and dryer, this little place is literally a full home that I could have happily stayed in for a week or longer!
We did hear the animals, the chickens (crowing roosters) and ducks (chatting in honks as they waddle along) wander through the yard, but I heard them more from the bathroom and they didn't bother me from the bedroom. We met two cats who were very friendly once they knew we wanted to say hi and give them pets.
GO SLOW on the driveway because the birds and cats might be out there! Use g.maps or something to give you directions because it is out in the country and would have been easy to drive past without g.maps tracking/directing us.
Ruby was super on top of communication and her little carriage house is a wonderful little home away from home.

Stayed with kids","Sheer perfection!! My husband and I absolutely loved Ruby's Carriage House with our two sons; 4 and 8 months. We are from the suburbs of Chicago and it was just the change of scenery we needed for our vacation. We enjoy all of the farm animals, and my son absolutely loved greeting Percy, the horse, each morning and before bedtime. He's still talking about him too. We didn't have the best weather and had to compete with rain and clouds the majority of our visit, so we enjoyed going downtown to Kansas City one day to Science City and then enjoyed picking peaches and blackberries at the Weston Orchard. If you are going to Weston, we fell in love with the BBQ at Tin Kitchen and highly recommend it.
If you're looking to go into town in St. Joseph, it's the most beautiful drive through the country and not that bad of a drive. The house is very well-equipped with everything and anything you will need. I feel that Ruby has been thoughtful in thinking through the little details. It was our first experience with Airbnb and we realized also how beneficial having a washer and dryer on vacation with little kids...that was a life saver! If you're staying at Ruby's we highly recommend getting something delicious to enjoy. Although she wasn't catering the week we were there, she still supplied us with delicious cinnamon rolls and a wonderful cake that was divine. We can't wait to return for her other meals. We had such a positive experience that my husband and I have already talked if we take a kid free weekend in the fall in the future to enjoy ourselves and when our next trip back will be. Ruby's place will be #1 on our list. We also shared our positive experience with others we know in St. Joseph and they were intrigued to even consider a weekend getaway locally too. We can't say enough good things about Ruby's and highly recommend you do yourself a favor and check it out if you're considering it."

It was a nice place to rest and if you are a runner a nearby dirt road offers some challenging hills.

Stayed a few nights","Very nice, clean, comfortable and well stocked! The bathroom is upstairs, as is the bedroom. The stairs turn at the top and the railing doesn't start until the 6th step from the top. I learned the hard way on the slippery wood steps not to do it in socks. Ruby is very good at communicating in timely fashion. We were prepared for roosters and farm noises, but the dogs barked all night, and are close by, in the pen. We had ear plugs and used the white noise machine (which is a thoughtful touch!) but we didn't sleep well and ended up leaving a day early so we could get a good night's sleep before going back to work. If you can sleep though barking you'll be fine. We didn't see any goats and only saw one horse and the pig, lots of chickens and the dogs. The animals we saw are friendly and fun to visit. Parking is close and entry is easy. It's a very nice place to stay! Ruby recommended we visit the town of Weston, which we did, and enjoyed it very much! There are a lot of cool historical things to do nearby."

The Carriage House was perfect for our stay with our 2 children (5 and 1). It is very well maintained, clean, and comfortable. Ruby's hospitality was beyond expectations. The location is a short drive from easy trails for kids to walk in addition to a very short walk to a little waterfall on a creek and plenty of room to roam in the fields. I would recommend this rental to anyone! Note: this a farm with a lot of grass. There are bugs! But, wearing the provided bug spray, we had no problems."

Stayed one night","Our stay was more of a business trip for me, but was hoping to enjoy some country living. Unfortunately, I got food poisoning (not from here), and had to stay put for our stay. Ruby went out of her way to help us so I could be ready for my work event. The carriage house had all we needed and more. The property is a real working farm so there is some animal noises, but we got used to the roosters and barking dogs quicker than we thought. We wished we had time to take in the whole property, but that will be for another visit."

Our toddler loved meeting all the animals. We enjoyed the easy hike to the waterfall. Ruby was super accomodating and cooked us a delicious dinner. Homemade pasta, what a treat! The location was quiet and peaceful and a great jumping off point for day trips to St. Joseph and Weston. We wouldn't hesitate to book again."

Everything was clean, the beds were comfortable, and the kitchen is a cooks dream-fully equipped with all necessary items to prepare a ""feast"" , which is what we did during our stay. The home has all of the amenities you could want and if not the host generously suggested we contact him should we need anything else. All of the personal touches are warm and welcoming.

No problems and no complaints.
One suggestion. Could the beds on the first floor be lower to the carpet. It was alright for younger guests but a challenge for older guests. Either way, we would book the house again in the future."

Group trip","We could not have imagined what awaited us at the Farmhouse. It was the perfect setting to host our family for our youngest's graduation at Benedictine College. Our adult children flew into KC Airport, only 45 minutes away. We had quality downtime in this spectacular, retreat like setting. All bedrooms were private and had new lineins, towels, and comfortable beds. If you could imagine, we were out in the Kansas Countryside but only 10 minutes directly down the road from all the events during graduation weekend. We would highly recommend The Farmhouse for families of BC students. Thank you for hosting us in your beautiful home!"

The house was immaculately clean and included thoughtful details such as a highchair and pack n’ play for my baby, suitcase stands, comfy beds and fluffy towels which made our stay even more comfortable. The location was also perfect, with easy access to nearby attractions. Visited the charming downtown to try a new coffee shop.
January was a bit chilly, but I would like to come back in summertime for the outdoor bathtub/shower! I highly recommend this Airbnb and look forward to staying here again in the future."

The house was squeaky clean and welcoming. We will definitely stay here next time we visit Atchison KS!"

over the world and it took Atchsion, Kansas to make it on our ""best Airbnb yet"" list! This house has more amenities than our own home! The house is up to date with a modern vibe you rarely find much less in a small town. The location is perfect to many attractions of town and the hosts are so amenable that you feel like you've known them all your life. The house is perfect for large and small groups with everything you need at your fingertips. Our standard for what an Airbnb should look like have now been set. The quaint charm of this house will make you not want to leave and the owners will soon be on your Christmas list as friends. It's a Must visit, A Must Stay."

Not only did they provide a great full kitchen (with water in the fridge) and numerous bedrooms sleeping up to 8 to 10 people, but also they added extra amenities like a beautiful backyard barbecue area and resting place, and even an old record player that plays real records to fit in with the theme of the inside of the house. Finally, Marty was so gracious to come out and meet us that morning and talk with us. We would definitely like to stay there again."

These host thought of everything. The house is so beautiful, clean, the beds were comfy with plenty of blankets, the kitchen had everything from blenders, pots and pans, silverware, plates and glasses. There was lots of coffee in the morning and a porch to drink it on. I travel around 4 to 5 times a year with friends and we always stay at air bnb. This is by far the best air bnb we have ever stayed at.
If i could give them 10 stars I would!
Thank you,

Group trip","Marty and Kerry's place is a diamond in the rough. We had business in St. Joseph, MO which is an easy drive from Atchison and took in a Kansas City Chiefs game on our way home.
The home was clean, clean, clean and so comfortable. The three showers made it very easy for a group our size or larger. Everything was first class from the towels to the showers to being able to connect with Bluetooth to your own music in each bathroom. I've never seen a ceiling fan like the one in the upstairs bedroom. It's a classic. Privacy was not an issue with living rooms on each floor. Coffee was plentiful and the large kitchen was awesome! Oh, the Wi-Fi was fantastic. I hosted a ZOOM meeting while everyone else was online doing other things and the strength and bandwidth of the signal easily accommodated the situation.
I hope we get a chance to get back here again soon because there are some great restaurants within minutes of the home.
