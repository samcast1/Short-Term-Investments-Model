Stayed over a week","This was a fantastic place to stay while I settled in to my new job in town and looked for more permanent lodging. Kent was a super nice and helpful host and helped make the experience a real pleasure. The place is located on a sleepy little side street so it's nice and quiet, but it's just a block from Main Street with plenty of restaurant and bar options. I highly recommend this clean and cozy place and its wonderful host Kent."

The location was beautiful and it was centrally located - but not walking distance to restaurants and stores. We would definitely stay here again. The only drawback is the steep driveway and the lack of a primary bedroom closet for hanging clothes. A rack of some sort would have been a good thing. Overall, an excellent place to stay. Many thanks to Tiffany."

Stayed with kids",Tiffany’s bnb was very clean and comfortable. I appreciated how quickly they responded when I asked a question. This house was easily the most stocked Airbnb I hate visited. The kitchen was full of utensils and the bathrooms were stocked with soap and towels. The outside stairs and drive way are steep but not too bad for able bodied people. Something to consider with older guests or guests with mobility problems.

Stayed about a week",I lived in the area for 17 years before moving away in 2007. Both of my boys stayed in the area. I came back to bury my wife who passed away in a memory care facility - she had dementia. I needed to rent a home so I could entertain my boys and their immediate families as well as people who wished to pass on condolences. Tiffany's home was perfect. She also was able to accommodate an extension of my stay without any hesitation. I will have no hesitation in rebooking as I need to.

My wife made the comment 20 minutes into being there “ this is probably the most well stocked bnb we have stayed at in a long time.” The beds are sleep numbers. They have board games galore. Extensive book shelf with a wide array to choose from. For those of you who like hot baths, get after it."

Tiffany was a great hostess home was beautiful and met most of our needs.
Had a family member that needed handicap requirements and the only issue was the steep driveway and the steps to the front door. We knew about these issues prior to the reservation and it was not that bad for him to adjust to them.
All in all everything was great.
Thanks again

The house was amazing with an awesome open floor plan and spacious rooms which all fit our needs perfectly. My wife and I are retired and travel extensively both domestic and abroad and I must say this was one of the best stocked properties with soaps, shampoos and numerous other thoughtful items. There were numerous boxes of tissues, rolls of paper towels and plenty of toilet paper. I could go on and on about the attention to detail to the items made available to give guests the feeling of being at home."

Even little details I never expect at airbnbs, like the pillows are amazing and the cookware is high quality and the sheets are actually nice. I even watched Andor on the TV and it was great, cozy couch, good sound. Above and beyond!
We chose this place because of the internet and workspaces, and it was perfect. We were both in zoom meetings all day for two days and had zero hiccups in internet speed or connectivity. And we couldn't hear each other at all! Even the setting was cute so I looked good (well-lit with a nice-looking background) on zoom, haha.
Plus, Tiffany is a great host. Super flexible with our needs, and super helpful when we accidentally left something behind. I'll be staying here again if I can!"

Their place was clean, comfortable and welcoming. We felt like we had our own little condo all to ourselves complete with a patio and an amazing river and surrounding view. We appreciated the extras like toiletries, hairdryer, reading material, water dispenser, coffee bar and condiments in the refrigerator to name a few.
We would come back in a heart beat!"

The decor included beautiful linens, thoughtful touches, and easy- care flooring in the common areas. Toys, books, optional plasticware in the kitchen, and an outdoor seesaw helped our three year-old grandchild feel so welcome. There was plenty of parking and a pretty, fenced garden for informal gatherings. The upstairs bedroom with twin beds can accommodate adults although the sloped ceiling may require stooping. The upstairs also had an additional TV and couch area. We would stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","Samantha is a wonderful host. Her house is a home away from home. Spacious kitchen and living room. Beds were comfy and we loved the tall queen bed in master bedroom. Our teenagers loved the upper level as their own space. Samantha had basic bathroom amenities that you would expect from a hotel: bar soap, shampoo/conditioner, hair dryer, towels, handsoap for sink (we have been in a couple air bnb's that had no bathroom amenities, when we were expecting some). Pictures listed are extremely accurate. Heat worked well, no drafts. We would reserve this place again in a heartbeat. Conveniently located: 7minute drive to cross country race course at the newer high school, 5 minutes from Applebee's, and just a little further down street is a MOD pizza. Rosauers store less than 5 minutes from house."

We were able to use the garage to secure our bikes overnight which is always nice. The AC down stairs was very cool. We didn’t use the kitchen at all but my mates used the coffee machine which they enjoyed.
The only negative would be it was hot upstairs were I was, but on that weekend it was around 100F
We will certainly try and rent again next year when we return to the area.
Lots of restaurants around the area, if you want a good breakfast, try Jeffery’s restaurant."

Stayed with kids","This house was perfect for my family. My husband, my three year old, and one year old were in the LC Valley for my sister's wedding. This house accommodated us perfectly. There was plenty of space and it is beautifully decorated and furnished. The best parts were all of the child-friendly components to the house: outlet covers, child silverware and dishes, kids books and even a few toys. We didn't get to play in the backyard because of rain but it was fenced in and looked perfect for kids to get a little fresh air and run! The house was really easy to get to and the garage was a real bonus. Samantha went above and beyond! I'm a bit of an anxious traveler, especially with little kids, and she eagerly and quickly answered all of my questions. She even offered to bring a baby tub over to the house for my littlest daughter! She was very personable and friendly. We will definitely be staying here again!"

The listing description was dead on. It really can sleep 6 comfortably. There really is a kitchen nicely stocked with a nice spice rack. There really is a full sized washer and dryer. Add a huge backyard.
If you are going to the fair or the Round Up this is an ideal location.
I loved the place. I'll bookmark this place!"

Group trip","The house was perfect for us in every way. We really appreciated being able to use the garage, as we had towed our jet skis along. It gave us great piece of mind to be able to secure them in the garage. Few rentals offer this accommodation. I loved the new flooring, counters, and fixtures which made everything feel so clean and nice, and enough beds and space to accommodate the whole family. The house is nicely decorated and furnished; very comfortable. The fully fenced back yard is private, shaded, and pretty, with a nice patio that can be used for outdoor dining. The street in front can be surprisingly busy, resulting in some early morning traffic noise in the front bedroom; but the back bedroom was quiet. Lots of room in the driveway for parking and easy access in and out. It was hot while we were in town, and the owner had put on fans and air conditioner prior to our arrival, which was much appreciated. We had a perfect time and hope to use this house again."

The house was not just a place to stay; it became our home away from home, thanks to Jennifer's impeccable attention to detail and thoughtful touches throughout. The backyard and outdoor activities are simply to die for!!!!
The furniture was so cozy that it felt like a warm hug after a long day of WSU obligations. Every corner of the house was filled with charm and character, making it the perfect backdrop for creating lasting memories with loved ones.
Although we encountered an unfortunate situation (my fault 100%) on our first night, Jennifer's super caring response and reassuring demeanor immediately eased my worries, demonstrating her unwavering commitment to ensuring her guests' happiness and comfort. Unbelievable!

Our stay at Sweet Retreat was nothing short of amazing! From the moment we arrived, we were in awe of everything this fantastic place has to offer.
The huge TV made our family movie nights an unforgettable experience. And the pool? Wow! We had the time of our lives hosting pool parties, enjoying the outdoor BBQ, and relaxing in the shaded pool area. The deep dive pool was an absolute hit, and the basketball court provided endless fun for everyone.
But it didn’t stop there! The huge kitchen made meal preparation a breeze and allowed us to enjoy quality family time together. Everything about Sweet Retreat was well thought out and perfectly designed for a family getaway.
Located conveniently near WSU, this was the ideal place for our family to stay during our visit. If you’re looking for a joyous and comfortable vacation spot, look no further than Sweet Retreat. We can’t wait to return!

Everything is new and extremely well done. Bed is comfortable, as is the seating in the living area. Location is amazing with easy access to the bike / walking oath and Lewiston, just across the river bridge."

Only problem was host forgot to email me the check-in code and I had to ask for it. But she apologized and it was easy to get in otherwise. Directions and parking were clear and I'd stay again"

Friendly poodle greeted me when I arrived and allowed me to toss her stuffed toy a few times for fetch. We are moving into the area and will keep Sandy in mind for recommending our friends and family to stay when they visit!

There was a nice basket and shelf of snacks. There were several chargers, wall hooks, places for our luggage, a great little electric fireplace to make the living room area cozy, a drawer full of bathroom necessities you may have forgotten, and products in the shower. In addition, there were restaurant menus, maps of the area, and lots of fun games! The bed was so comfortable! We were warmly greeted when we arrived, even though it was a dark and cold night! The location was convenient to Lewiston and Clarkston both. There was a good bit of snow when we stayed, but would love to come back when the weather is nice and we could enjoy the view from the little patio. We enjoyed our getaway for two; and would definitely stay again! Thank you Sandy and Cal!"

Sandy and her husband were extremely welcoming, and accommodated our late check-in so graciously. They greeted us the next morning and we met their adorable dogs. It's so hard to find this these days, as most AirBnBs are owned by investors and do not feel comfortable. I felt like I was staying with a good family friend - it was so relaxed and homey. And full of character! If you want exposure to local photographers and things to do, the shelf with recommendation and the art around the bnb will give you a taste! A gem, in the Gem State! Thanks, Sandy! <3"

Plus the 'Doodle welcome committee is not to be missed. The neighborhood is the best of both worlds - rural but a very easy short drive back into downtown Clarkston and Lewiston. This was a terrific home away from home. I'll be back!"

Sweet decor, comfortable dreamy bed, pristine, well stocked, and wonderful in every way. It was our first time exploring the area and we enjoyed spending two days seeing the historical land of the Nez Perce, countryside, towns of Lewiston and Clarkston, and wineries. At night we turned on the little fireplace, relaxed in the recliner leather couch, and watched western films. Such fun! We hope to return some day!"

Stayed with kids","I wanted to find a nice place that was cool in the summer with good A/C. I found it. We were comfortably cool. We didn't have control of the thermostat, but they offered to let us open the windows if needed. We left the windows closed but closed all the HVAC vents and it was plenty cool. The only thing lacking was counter space in the bathroom, which is clearly visible in the photos. They did have storage under the sink which was acceptable. The electrical outlets are located in odd places, but they did have short, corded power strips which helped. The TV was a little small since it was across the room from the seating. The TV remote looked dirty, but it wasn't needed since the Fire TV remote also controlled the TV power. One thing that would help would be a water pitcher to put in the fridge for colder drinking water. Some things were a little harder to find like the soap under the sink, coffee cups above and left of the sink, and blankets in the ottoman. They had K-cups we didnt use"

Stayed with kids","Seriously the best place to stay! Our family of 5 loved it. It was really weird to be out of state for Christmas but it felt like a home Away from home! There was some Christmas decorations as well ☺️
Everything was so clean & very modern. So many beautiful details, I was extremely impressed!
Our girls were so excited for their own room & quickly set up their things.
There were games & she even put a bucket of blocks when she found out we had kiddos, even asked if we needed a pack nplay.
Everything was intentional and thoughtful. The first night I went to turn on rain sounds on my phone and there was a sound machine by the bed as well as a phone charger already plugged into the bedside lamp.
The beds were comfortable, the couch was super comfortable too. The pillows were amazing- better than hotels.
And the bathroom deserves its own page of glowing review because wow. The shower was so stinking cool I didn’t want to get out, but when I did the towels were insanely fluffy!
The decor was simple & beautiful. HIGHLY highly recommend this place 🤩"

We had plenty of room for all of us, location was great and kids were happy! The updates were amazing, especially the rain fall shower! So relaxing! Would have loved to have some flavored creamer packets for the coffee but I made it work LOL. We will definitely stay here again for the next tournament since the house was about a block away from the fields. Thank you!"

We didn’t use any of the amenities like the kitchen because we were only staying for the night and didn’t need it.
Only two complaints: the house is old (made in 1921!) And therefore it creeks a lot. It takes some adjusting to get used to. Second complaint is about the motion light in the backyard right next to the window of the bedroom. It activated a lot in the night and woke me up every time.
Other than that, good place. Thank you for hosting us =)"

I did not read beyond the Entire Home part, and just looked at the photos and reviews. None of those reviews mentioned that there is an open space between the main floor and the basement. The basement is occupied and the sound does travel, including the coming and going of the basement occupants. It was a little unnerving and noisy. It does say all of this in the description, and I should have taken the time to read more.
If you are okay with the noise of other occupants, then this home is a wonderful place to stay - beautiful craftsman, clean, and well equipped in a nice area."

The kitchen is very well supplied - probably the best stocked kitchen we have seen from staying at AirBnBs.
This is in a historic bungalow. We are particularlyl fond of historic homes so this was an easy fit. We appreciated how the house has been preserved with original or reproduction hardware and woodwork to fit the house architecture. The furnishings were well chosen to work with the house style.
This place is close in proximity to Lewis Clark State College. If you have children attending the college, it is an easy walking distance from campus. We will definitely be back to visit."

Comfortable beds & large kitchen worked well for us.
However i did have to clean more than expected upon arrival. I pride myself on being tidy & treated their place as if it was my own. There were a lot of dishes that while in cabinets were not clean, the stove top had visible residue & it was pretty dusty throughout the home, & with the season changes there were little beetles we would find in the home. We also did have to stagger showers for the family as the hot water ran out within 10 mins of one person showering.
I made sure to leave the home in better cleanliness than when we arrived."

Stayed with kids","Where to begin. This place exceeded all our expectations. This trip to Clarkston (to visit relatives), I was accompanied by my niece, her husband, and there two-year-old sweetheart. So, I needed larger accommodations. From the photos it appeared to have ample space and could accommodate a few family members. For a condo this had a lot of square feet. They occupied space on one end of the condo, and we were in the master bedroom. Each room had minimal furniture and felt VERY spacious. The place was modern, and smelled like it was built a week before we arrived (Carpet, walls, Kitchen, everything). The place was spotless and had every amenity that we needed. As weather permitted, drinking coffee out on the deck with a nice view was awesome. This place is a nice little nugget. I would certainly stay here again and recommend for all the reasons I forementioned. Clean, spacious, nice neighborhood, and conveniently located shopping."

Stayed a few nights","Great place, we really enjoyed the kitchen and will stay here again!
Trina was great and flexible, helping us get checked in earlier than expected. Very nice appliances in the kitchen and very well stocked with flatware and cooking utensils. The main living area is very nice and has a relaxing atmosphere. The beds are comfortable and it is generally very quiet, with a caveat below.
Some things to keep in mind:
- The master bedroom shares a wall with the neighbor and their TV was very loud at night, we ended up not using that room and sleeping in another room away from the shared wall.
- Although the instructions say otherwise, the keypad does not lock itself, just make sure you remember to lock it.
- Very clean except for hair left in the shower in the master bathroom, it may have just been missed as everything else was cleaned.
- The showers have poor water pressure, probably just need to have the hard water scaling cleaned out of the shower heads."

Chocolate Nutella truffles, mini key lime pies (bite sized)
Fruit tarts with vanilla custard, Biscoff trifles and red velvet hockey puck type cakes. If you bake you understand the need for a quality kitchen.
Not only did we have that, we had all the living space for less than my friends who rented hotel rooms.

Group trip","This Airbnb lived up to its promise of being ""Brand New."" Everything was spotless, sparkling clean, and very comfortable. We had 5 of us renting the place, so everyone had a bedroom, and with two bathrooms, we all were able to get ready easily and on time. The furniture was very comfortable and accommodated all of us in the living room, and the open floor plan allowed us to be together.
Trina was very helpful with her clear instructions, and the key pad entrance is such a great feature, so people could come and go as our schedules were different at times. I had trouble with the Airbnb app not allowing me to get the keypad code, and Trina answered my phone call immediately and got us in with no waiting outside in the cold. Trina has supplied the place with all the necessary items needed for a comfortable stay - the kitchen is well supplied and the bathrooms had extra towels and washcloths. I would highly recommend this place for anyone coming to Lewiston."

Airport only has a couple larger planes per day so no issues with noise. The apartment is very well stocked with everything you need for cooking and serving meals. Beds were comfortable and everything was nice and clean. We'll certainly look to stay here again if we're in the area!

The high-end finishes, well stocked with supplies and extra linens provided for the comfort of home.
the unit is in a quiet area of Lewiston, we felt very safe and slept well.
the out door space (patio) was perfect in the morning for quiet coffee and personal time.
we do not have any complaints or concerns and would recommend this unit for your stay in Lewiston.
the host was responsive and helpful to all of our communication.
our son, daughter in love and soon to be grandson live in Lewiston, we hope this unit will be available for our future visits."

Tiffany had a dog bed that our littlest one felt ar home in. She even left water dishes and treats 🦴🐾. King sized bed was a bonus with another TV. The backyard was super cute with fire pit and chairs to relax. We enjoyed ourselves very much and definitely want to return on our next family visit. Tiffany was very responsive and kind.
Thank you so very much for having us stay 💜

Her attention to detail (snacks for guests, all types of condiments, coffee pods & creamer, tea, & popcorn maker to name a few), extremely fast response time, and cleanliness of the place would absolutely make me choose the Juniper Cottage again if I come to Lewiston."

Stayed one night","If you are a small group of 2-4 people, Tiffany's Juniper Cottage is a great place to stay. It is a recently remodeled small cottage, with very tasteful updating of decor and basic furnishings, while maintaining the quaint and cozy cottage aspect. There is a fully-equipped kitchen, a comfortable living room, a cozy bedroom with a king bed, and clever usage of sliding barn doors to maximize usable space. The yard is quiet, with several places to sit and a bonfire pit. Tiffany has thought of a lot of helpful touches, such as lots of hooks to in every room to hang things on, Boxes of Kleenex in a couple rooms for those of us with sinus issues (thank you, Tiffany!), and extra pillows and blankets. We greatly enjoyed our stay. You will too."

They were super good about answering my questions and even accommodated me when I needed to have a package sent to the Airbnb, so it would be waiting when I arrived. I was in town for a high school reunion, and my friends remarked how impressed they were with my digs. Some said they planned to tell others about this Airbnb. I made a lot of wonderful memories connecting with friends at this ""home away from home."" I probably spent as much time out on the deck as I did inside during the day! The view was gorgeous and peaceful. I was pleasantly surprised that even on some pretty warm days (upper 80s), the shady deck worked a bit like a wind tunnel, capturing a delightful breeze. This is definitely going to be my go-to spot any time I come back to the valley to visit!"

The hosts were very accommodating and allowed me to modify the length of my stay. I appreciated their prompt responses to my questions. I wish I could have stayed longer to appreciate the house and location. Amazing views!"

So much to do in Clarkston/Lewiston. We went to Nez Perce National Park and Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center, and strolled at Hell's Gate State Park, drove up Spiral Highway to enjoy the jaw dropping view of the confluence of Snake and Clearwater Rivers. Highlight of the trip was a jet boat ride with Snake Dancer Excursions - absolutely memorable and highly recommended! There is also an outstanding indoor/outdoor aquatic center nearby which is open to the public. At the AirBnB, we enjoyed strolling the neighborhood and seeing the vineyards and the antics of the local goats. Hosts are very welcoming and responsive. Great find, enjoy!"

It was a lovely experience and maybe the nicest AirBNB I’ve stayed in"

Stayed a few nights","We had a delightful two nights at Robyn and Ryan's Airbnb. Communication with Robyn was excellent. When we needed some extra supplies, she was over with them immediately. The house is roomy with an amazing view from the main living area and outside eating area. We saw an incredible sunset one evening. It is only a ten minute drive to the jet boat for Hell's Canyon. Albertsons in Clarkston was recommended by Robyn and was excellent. It is right next to a Costco."

Robyn & Ryan are great hosts and have a very clean and well appointed location, with a very amazing view of the mountains surrounding the property. You can see the town and the mountains, Day & Night!! ✝️
I thank them for their outstanding location. sadly Airbnb has the worst customer service on the planet.
Airbnb’s customer service rating is -100 and that’s a positive..........HORRIFICALLY TERRIBLE"

It is located in a quiet neighborhood - there is a vineyard on the other side of the street, and you can sample the finished product at Basalt Winery down the hill in the Clarkston! Ryan and Robyn were quick to respond, and check-in and check-out was a breeze!"

Stayed with kids","This place is very accurately described, and what you see is what you get: a good view, lots of light, clean, and comfortable. I didn’t realize there isn’t a door on the bathroom, and for a couple one person has to leave the bedroom to give the other person privacy. You can tell this from the photos, I just didn’t realize it. Also, while the light is wonderful, even with the blinds drawn the bedroom is very bright for sleeping/napping unless it’s dark out. However that is also pretty clear from the photos, and the view is nice. I like a little better coffee, but that’s a personal preference, others might prefer the chocolate/crackers/popcorn that were there. There is plenty of shampoo, conditioner, and a very spacious shower with a large shower head. We both enjoyed the shower. The kitchen has everything you need to cook, and we enjoyed the picnic table, and outdoor area. The hosts were quick to communicate, and gave detailed instructions on everything we needed to know. It’s a pleasant little spot with a vineyard across the street, and we liked it."

The views from the house over the valley are spectacular and there's a vineyard across the street all while just 10-15 minutes from downtown shopping and restaurants. The Higgins family were also a real delight as hosts-easy to communicate with, friendly, happy to share local recommendations and just good people."

One of the best airbnb's I have stayed in- felt just like home."

Sharing bathroom was not a problem because non= one was in the the other unit, noise was not a problem because no one was in unit above and there was no live music next door since I was there midweek."
