Stayed one night","Ben was super! The property was wonderful and I’m sad we were only in town for one night. I had initially booked their other Silo and after talking with Ben about parking a horse trailer we had with us, he recommended this location which had plenty of space for the truck and trailer. I made a few mistakes making the new reservation and was super apologetic to Ben for all the cancel and rebooking notifications he was getting because I was on the struggle bus that day. He was polite and understanding the entire time. 10/10 would recommend anyone who wants a cool stay in a silo on a bit of beautiful property that’s still conveniently close to town."

Stayed a few nights","Loved it, very unique, kitty came to snuggle on our last day. The listing states ""surrounded by pasture"" not sure what definition of surrounded is being used, but upon arrival I was a little disappointed that we were in the host's yard beside their house, and very little actual pasture, the pictures online are a little deceiving in that way but we still had a good time and it was still very private and we were not bothered during our stay. :)"

Stayed one night","The Silo was gorgeous inside and such a cool idea. We loved having a little back patio to ourselves with the hot tub which was really nice. However, it was so close to the house that it felt a little weird being in someone’s backyard only because the listing makes it seem like you’re out there alone. You couldn’t really use the top balcony with a view in the morning unless you wanted to see whoever was at the house out working on all the stuff they had outside. Loved staying here, just feel like it would’ve been nice to know it wasn’t as secluded as expected. 😊"

Had unique and fun touches to the space, you can tell it was thoughtfully crafted and built inside like heated floors on the first floor, games and bathroom had hand built storage. Would be great to visit here in the summer and enjoy the outdoor patios more. This shares property with host residence but Ben was very respectful of privacy and we came and left as we pleased. Gets a lot of daylight, enjoy the mornings!"

The only thing to note is that the Silo is right next door to the family’s property so it is not as private as initially expected. However, we did not see anyone during our stay and the hosts were very kind so it didn’t bother us at all. Would definitely stay again if we ever come back to Washington!! Thanks Ben!"

Stayed one night","Ben’s place was great! Only thing I was disappointed with was the fact that the hot tub pictured did not match the actual hot tub at the place. The hot tub at the place is one of the blow up hot tubs, which worked absolutely great. I was just expecting the actual pictured hot tub size and look. I still enjoyed my stay, the hot tub was nice and hot, clean, and ready for me to use when I arrived. Easy self check-in. Ben was very responsive and everything else in the place looked just like in the photos. My favorite part was the bed! Very cozy and soft comforters and pillows.
In regards to privacy, the place is right next to the owner’s home and what seemed like a workshop area, so you can hear cars and people coming in and out. Wasn’t an issue for me, but worth mentioning.
Overall a great stay! Thank you for hosting me! Will be coming back for sure! ☺️"

Stayed one night","Took my wife for a little getaway for just one night. Ellensburg is her hometown and this was a fun and unique place to stay. The silo was such a great stay and we absolutely loved all it had to offer. Check in was easy, it smelled great and even had some stocked items in the fridge. It is right next to the hosts home which we didn't see in the pictures but we didn't mind. The bed was extremely comfortable and the linens felt luxurious. The ac was definitely a plus as it was a beautiful and warm weekend in the burg. The downstairs hot tub was out of commission but the inflatable one on the upstairs porch was awesome! It was nice soaking while watching the sunrise. By far the best Airbnb we've stayed in. You're only minutes from town and it was easy finding the place. Would absolutely recommend the silo for anyone looking to relax in a fun space. Definitely would love to come back!"

Ben was super flexible and responsive - especially since we were coming in very very late and leaving late as well.
The stay is almost better than pictures and everything was available and open and we felt right at home.
The only downside is we had only booked one night! I wish we could’ve have stayed longer!
12/10 stay. The host was just as amazing as the stay itself."

Stayed a few nights",Definitely would recommend this place! The Silo is beautiful inside and we really enjoyed the hot tub in the evenings. Ben is a great host! Place is clean and very cute. There were snacks and beverages provided which we didn’t expect but was a nice surprise. This place is very close to a lot of places to eat or go shopping. We even got a visit from a sweet kitty who really likes to talk.

Stayed a few nights","We really enjoyed our time at The Silo. We took advantage of the hot tub and outdoor seating area. We used the grill and had enough kitchen amenities to fix a small meal or two. It is a super charming space and met our needs for the trip.
On our second day, we noticed that the only outlet in the only bathroom was not working. After troubleshooting in all possible ways we could think of, we tried calling Ben, the host, per posted instructions in the kitchen. There was no answer, so we left a message with information stating the problem and how to reach us, as we were leaving for the day. We returned to find the outlet still not working, no note saying anything had been done and no return phone call.
Outside of that situation, we had a great time! Thank you for having us."

Stayed one night","This place is just fantastic. We are sad that we did not come in a few days earlier so we could stay longer. Highly recommend!
Note one review said they would be worried to stay in the summer with no A/C. That review was incorrect as we stayed likely the hottest day of the year (98 degrees) and there was a room A/C unit that kept the bedroom a pleasant temp (cool, not cold) and large ceiling fan that even satisfied my husband that hates being hot.
Peaceful and unique and a reason we would come back to Ellensburg again even though we had not been planning on it. I want a silo of my own."

Stayed with a pet","This place was wonderful! It was far enough from the city to seem ""in the middle of nowhere"" but in reality it is only a 10-minute drive to a Safeway. The place seemed to be in really great condition, both appliance wise and cleanliness.
Ben did a great job leaving us to enjoy the place to ourselves, but left his number so he was always available if needed. We did in fact need to contact him once, when we had an issue with the grill, and he literally drove around town to get what he needed for the grill to work again.
Overall, the experience was amazing. The silo really felt like a ""home-away-from-home,"" Ben did an amazing job building it. He is definitely a superhost, if you are considering staying here, I say YES!"

Stayed a few nights","We stayed here for a something unique and this was it. Quiet little area. Comfortable & cozy. I do suggest going to bed early to watch the sunset and the skylights/windows will let a lot of light in so make sure you’re ready for it! Wake up early, sit on the porch enjoy some coffee. Maybe the cat will come take a visit, he got lots of pets from us! Ben responded pretty quickly. This isn’t a huge deal, but I did notice by other reviews that they loved the heated floors downstairs, we didn’t get that and noticed most of the light switches were taped off so I’m not sure if it’s a maintenance issue. Like it’s not a big deal & nit pick, just some things we missed out on. The kitchen table is a lot smaller, can’t really sit at it, maybe sideways. I also noticed the listing said air conditioning, their was none there. It is April, so like I mention not a huge biggy. But just keep in mind when seeing the listing before staying. Overall, was a very good stay, Ben was nice, cat was a bonus!"

The space was clean, well decorated, and warm on such a cold weekend. It was a perfect place to relax. Super fast internet for streaming movies and maybe 5 minutes from everything Ellensburg has to offer. There are some vocal roosters next door but that didn’t bother us at all. Perfect place for couples to get away and slow down. 7 1/2 months pregnant and slept great with comfy linens, plush pillows, and high quality mattress. Ps the floors downstairs are heated and felt so good on our feet, Ben has truly paid such great attention to detail."

And was kind enough to offer my family and me a later check-out time due to it being our first time traveling with an infant. This place had everything we needed. It felt quite spacious (especially the bathroom and kitchen) even though the home itself has a small footprint. The home is simply, tastefully decorated and comfortable. The house is within walking distance to many good shops and restaurants. I highly recommend this listing :-)"

Our 9 yo and our pup really enjoyed the space to sprawl out and play, or snuggle up and watch movies. Everything was either within walking distance or only a few minutes drive away. We loved the board full of recommendations and spent some time checking out the local galleries and bakeries. The only thing I didn't realize until our stay is that part of the fence in the back is only a couple feet high, so it's easy for a pup to hop."

At first I thought that I would check to see if there was a room available at Suncadia, but after looking at the prices I thought about sleeping in my car! So I jumped on Airbnb and got really really lucky. Hildur responded right away which was a relief. I tell ya her place was absolutely perfect. Even a washer and dryer which was welcome after camping. Fenced in and secluded back yard for my furry companion. Hardwood floors with glass doornobs remined me of my Grandmother's cozy house. Thank you Hildur for a wonderful stay! Marcie Eaton and Daisy"

Stayed one night",Chellsi and I enjoyed our stay. Main St eateries and the CWU campus were conveniently located to the property for our needs and the accommodations in the home were to our standards. The bed was a bit on the smaller side as we are rather tall humans (6’3” and 5’8”) but it worked out as we only stayed one night. Would and will stay again if we’re ever in need of accommodations in the area.

The homeowner paid special attention to all details, like bed comfort, nightstands, placement of towel hooks, kleenex in the rooms, fuzzy throws for the couch, etc. Our little dog loved the yard and walks in the neighborhood. We appreciated that the host communicated with us before and during the stay. We are glad to finally find a nice home to stay at with our dog in Ellensburg. We will certainly be returning to Depot House!"

The space is roomy, cozy, and since the host takes such care to anticipate the needs of their guests, it was easy to simply relax and unwind during my stay. The house itself is very cute with an outdoor patio and garden where you can sit and enjoy your morning coffee. The inside is full of modern furnishings and fixtures, some very nice local artwork on the walls, and chapel ceilings that make this one bedroom house feel much bigger on the inside. I really appreciated the bulletin board with recommendations for local restaurants as well as the variety of cooking utensils in the kitchen so that I didn't have to eat out for every meal. The location is perfectly situated close to main street so that almost everything you need is within walking distance. I highly recommend staying here and would gladly stay again on future visits."

It is located directly across from a Safeway grocery store, which makes it simple to pick up anything you need that the unit doesn't provide. Hotel quality linen, towels, and bedding. Even packets of coffee to use in the coffee maker just like your nice hotels. Parking was on-site, just steps from the door. Extremely easy check-in with a super responsive host. The town is delightful and is only 40 minutes from the Gorge Amphitheater and 2 hours from Seattle. I've stayed in Air Bnbs from Paris to Portugal to Puerto Rico and this is one is definitely top 5!"

The house was in great shape and in a good area. Far enough away from downtown to feel private and secluded, yet close enough to be able to run to the store and back in 30 minutes.

Group trip","Katrina and Adam’s farmhouse is amazing. The pictures don’t do the home justice. It’s on a huge lot and we loved seeing all the cattle right there driving up the driveway. It’s a beautiful modern farmhouse that is so nicely decorated as well. Tons of natural light, spacious rooms, comfortable beds/bedding, a bonus family room with a sectional and large TV, nice big kitchen great for groups, and a backyard that’s wonderful for gathering on summer nights. There were 10 of us adults in town for a wedding and it was perfect for all of us. We had everything we needed there at the house but the local grocery stores/downtown were just a 10 minute drive away."

We had such a great area for our family to gather and have meals and laughs, and the space was so inviting and safe. The farmhouse was clean and airy with everything you would need for a family to vacation and still have necessities in the kitchen throughout the house. The house is very spacious and so is the yard, the cows are an added plus of relaxing.

The house is brightly lit with huge windows looking out at the range land and foothills that surround it. Having two living areas, plus an open concept kitchen and separate dining made sharing this house with eight people, aged 17 to 72 years, no problem. Every room is spacious, and the four bedrooms and yes, four bathrooms, made for easy living. I can honestly say that I cannot think of one negative comment except to say, it is such a lovely home, it makes it hard to leave.

We stayed in October and spent time one night out by the fire pit, which was tranquil and fun. We didn’t leave the farmhouse during our stay, but it is only a short drive to downtown Ellensburg if you’re planning to explore more than we were.

Stayed a few nights","Really an awesome place right in the heart of the action! Very clean, safe and comfy. The only things that were slightly inconvenient were parking and noise from the college nightlife. We were expecting the noise since we’re former CWU alum, but just something that would be good to let renters know. Just bring your sound machines and earplugs if you’re a light sleeper! We went to the adorable farmers market a half block away and walk to several cute shops and restaurants during our stay. A great weekend getaway!"

Stayed a few nights","What a cute place! I loved coming back to my college town being a ""grown up"". Back in the day we played shuffle board deep into the night right next door. I peeked in, the shuffle board has sadly found a home elsewhere. There was a moment of karma when some young folk exited the bar and made some loud exclamation. I apologize to anyone I did that to back in the day selfishly thinking of no one except myself and my friends; however, on the bright side, in a world recovering from a pandemic, as divided as it sometimes feels to me, it also put a smile on my face thinking that 30 years from now, one of them may be in my shoes, and if so I hope life will have been as good to them as it has been to me!
It was a wonderful stay, and I loved the style and decorations. Would, and probably will, stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","This was our very first AirB&B ever!
Pros - This place is beautiful. Right in the heart of downtown Ellensburg. Felt like home rather than another place to stay at. Love the activities, shops, and restaurants that were in walking distance. Check in was great. Space was great. There was treats, coffee, and the shower was amazing! Bed was comfy. And on Fridays, there is an amazing taco vendor right across the street from the place! A-MAZ-ING!
Cons - no elevators but a lot of stairs (which for me was great, my partner got his workout for sure) & parking was confusing because there is no parking in front of the place, we were a little confused as to wear to park and worried about ticketing, but we found a space and no tickets. Streets and other tenants were busy and a little loud that weekend, but again, we are used to it.
We would stay here again and again. Susan was responsive and didn't make us wait too long on any text or messages when we had a question. This place is great"

I would suggest bringing some white noise with you as the bar next door can get a bit noisy on the weekends. It is a college town, so just be mindful of that.
Other than that, no complaints! And honestly, with the white noise from my phone, I have no complaints at all!"

It was located in perfect walking distance to everything we wanted access to in Ellensburg: coffee shops, restaurants, cute shops, the library, and the college.

Stayed a few nights","Overall lovely space and would stay again with some earplugs.
Pros: Beautifully restored downtown space with high ceilings and stylish furniture just as pictured. The space was sparkly clean and had lots of great touches (snacks and drinks in the kitchen and lots of cooking utensils and plates and such). It’s a cute area with lots of walkable places to eat and drink and wander. Great location. The heater worked great. Check in and check out was very easy!
Cons: It is a noisy area. It was my first time in Ellensberg so I did not anticipate it. If you are sensitive to that sort of thing being earplugs. We struggled to sleep, the building has quiet hours - but music rattled our room in the evening and kept us from sleeping.
Other things to note: the listing amenities show a washer and dryer but we did not have one in unit (not a big deal but got to note). Parking can take a moment on the weekend, but nothing is too far a walk."

Stayed a few nights","The place is great for two people. Small space, but very comfortable and well laid out. The kitchen was great and well stocked for basic food prep so you don't have to go out for everything. Bed was comfortable. TV was nice (didn't use it much) and internet worked great. The bathroom was very nice. View windows and high ceilings were awesome.
A couple of noteworthy items:
One less than ideal feature was the staircase up from the street. My foot was in a cast during our visit (unexpectedly) and the stairs were a real pain. It is a significant staircase and there is no elevator. It is not ADA friendly. That said, I did the stairs at least once a day.
There is no parking in front of the building. Maybe I was more sensitive to it because I was in a foot cast, but you'll be at least a block away and there are a bunch of different types of parking in downtown Ellensburg, eg, motorcycle only, 15 minute parking, 3 hour parking, no overnight parking, no parking from 4AM-6AM, unlimited, or any combination depending on the day of the week. So you really have to pay attention to avoid ticket/tow.
Last but not least, noise. It is right next door to the loudest bar in Ellensburg and the party kicks off at 11:00 and goes until close. Other reviews talked about noise, but let me tell you it is LOUD. There is a note in the room with a number to complain to the police, but the police were already there several times throughout the night. Honestly, the bar wasn't really the problem (music wise they were fine). It was when the patrons left the bar and felt the need to communicate with what sounded like garbage can lids and megaphones.
Saturday morning I bought earplugs from the hardware store across the street.
Despite those things, I would stay again. Just probably not on a busy weekend like Rodeo or homecoming unless I plan on closing the bars."

This small studio was a lovely stay; the pictures don’t do it justice. The ceilings are high, great lighting, a rain shower, and comfortable bed. Susan had snacks and drinks in the kitchenette and we were able to make coffee in the Keurig in the morning. There are plenty of restaurants and bars to walk to as well. Very convenient.
One downside is that we were there on a Friday and Saturday night and it was quite loud til late from the surrounding bars. There is a number posted to call for noise disturbances, however.

The location in the center of town would normally be such a positive thing with great places to eat and drink and shop all around. However it is located next to a nightclub and, at least on the weekend, there is quite a bit of patron noise coming from it and the street. Not the worst thing in the world and you can drown out some of the sound by turning up the AC fan but it is the only drawback to an otherwise excellent airbnb."

Stayed a few nights","Susan’s place was perfect for our weekend trip to Ellensburg. The location is outstanding, being just down the street from many popular restaurants and nightlife opportunities. Parking can be a little tricky, and there isn’t a way to watch Netflix or other streaming services (short of using your own laptop or phone as their is WiFi). However, the studio is perfectly suited for two during a stay in the Burg. Bed is very comfortable and the AC / Heater unit is more than capable of handling the Ellensburg weather! 10/10 would stay again! Thanks, Susan!"

Stayed a few nights","The location of this studio is in downtown Ellensburgs that is walking distance to all the restaurants and shops in town. The studio is very clean and stylish with the renovation. Susan sends very easy instructions to follow to check in and enter the building. There are plenty of street parking in the area. The only thing was the location is near bars, which Friday and Saturday nights can be noisy with the college students out at night. We were having some trouble sleeping at night. Overall, this studio is greater for single or couple travelers. It has all the amenities you needed for simple cooking, coffee, and snacks are available in the studio. Highly recommend the place as long you don't mind the night time noises."

Stayed a few nights","I loved Susan's studio. It's in a marvelous historic, downtown building, and the apartment is wonderfully eclectic and stylish that reflects Susan's hard work and sharp eye for design. I feel obliged to point out that historic means there are stairs: not a problem for me. (The building was fully renovated and has sprinklers, smoke alarms, and modern electrical wiring and plumbing.) Also, downtown in a college town on a weekend night in Ellensburg means that the cowboys and college kids are whooping it up, but, when in Rome, toga party, right? Check out the nearby watering holes and say hello to the friendly locals: I am glad I did. Having said all that, Ellensburg is a peaceful and orderly town, with a 10PM sound curfew. Pay attention to the parking signs - overnight parking is very close by and Susan will provide a map. Bonus: take a walk by turning right and going south on Pearl street two blocks: there is an incredible art installation. Susan's studio is perfectly located for eating, entertainment, book and record shopping, and don't forget the seasonal Saturday farmer's market. Or you can simply lounge around and relax in an old time place with 20 foot high ceilings and transoms. Both options worked for me."

Stayed a few nights","Studio 202 is the spot if you're looking for the true downtown Ellensburg experience. Situated on Pearl St means all the bars are just outside your front door. The room itself is delightful, a wonderful modern representation of a room that has stood for over 100 years! Susan stocked the room with drinks and snacks before our arrival, a much appreciated touch. My only caution is that the room backs up to ""Club 301"" which is open until 2am every night. For light sleepers this may be a problem. If you're staying downtown to go out and enjoy the nightlife then this won't be an issue. Parking can be tricky as well since most places in the area are 2hr parking only. Overall, we look forward to staying here again."

Susan gave great thought into guests' needs with quality touches in the artwork, kitchen, refreshments both in the fridge and drawer pantry, and the bed is really comfortable for a great night's sleep! Parking was not even a problem. Communicating with Susan was easy and fast, too.

The amenities and layout was exactly what we were hoping for. And the location was perfect for the events of which we were visiting. The room, although efficient, was modern and not at all crowded. The high ceilings definitely balanced out the appearance of a small apartment. The bed was very comfortable and the large television was a pleasant surprise. We were extremely happy with our stay.
Something worth mentioning; there are a few small watering holes nearby within walking distance, just as there are throughout town. And, of course, there can be sounds of folks having a good time. This didn't bother either myself or my girlfriend as the sounds of partiers diminished around midnight and weren't that loud. After all, Ellensburg is a college town."

Lots of light (bring a sleep mask if you you want to sleep in) and maybe earplugs if you’re sensitive to noises as there’s a bit of foot traffic morning and night. We just turned on the kitchen fan at night as white noise. The water pressure was weak in the shower so it was not great for washing my hair but otherwise everything was perfect. We loved the art and the calming blue walls. The A/C was great. The bed could not have been comfier. Definitely walk to the farmers market on Saturday morning!

Unfortunately, we probably should have played more attention to previous reviewers' comments about the train noise. I only heard one overnight, but my husband heard many. The beds were fine, but the couch wasn't particularly comfortable. The location is on the edge of nice neighborhood near a huge park (recommended). We liked the concert prints and general decor, but the train noise and uncomfortable couch brought down my otherwise 5-star review to a 4 stars."

We have returned multiple times and it has been wonderful each time! Never disappointed. We will easily return to stay here any time we make it back to Ellensburg.
Our host Josh was friendly and very easy to communicate with and always so accommodating.
Thank you for the wonderful stay(s)!

Well located. 4. Has 3 bedrooms (with TV’s in every room). 5. Has been expertly renovated/remodeled. - from top to bottom, interior and exterior, the owner’s ensured this home is perfect. 5. Has an owner that immediately responds to every enquiry. We’d re-book here without hesitation, and will recommend it to friends and relatives visiting Ellensburg. Simply a great place."

Stayed with kids","This place is beautifully renovated. We especially liked the multitude of dimmable lights. The location is conveniently walkable to downtown and to some local parks.
Of note, though, the next door neighbor has a very aggressive dog that will run right up to the low fence right by the sidewalk. If you remember the dog from the movie The Sandlot, you get the idea. So if you're going to walk into town or to the park with a child, I would recommend crossing the street right away to avoid that. The next afternoon, we returned walking toward the rental , not even passing that house, and the dog still was barking like crazy and pawing the fence facing the house. It's likely out of the control of the host, but it definitely contributed to the experience for us."

Superb cleanliness and maintenance of the property, a real gem of a stay only a few minutes by car from the town centre with shops, bars and restaurants. However, the kitchen is so well equipped you would be very happy to cook in and relax in the very comfortable lounge after a long drive. This property comes highly recommend."

Stayed with kids","My Daughter and I were coming into town for one night for a local festival at the college. I had booked a room at a hotel with other conference attendees, but a date mixup messed up my plans. I almost started to panic thinking I might not be able to find an affordable place to stay that was clean and nearby on such short notice. The only available hotels at that point were in Wenatchee! I checked out Airbnb, and was pleasantly surprised to find a cute, affordable, comfy looking space that was within blocks of the conference and college. I booked it immediately (it was actually less $ than the hotel-love that!). We had a full day and didn’t check in until late. I was grateful for the sofa bed so my daughter and I could each have our own space. She is a huge fan of fuzzy blankets-I was happy to find one in the closet for her bed. We had an early morning so really just there to sleep & shower. It was comfy, clean, and a great price. Would book again!"

Comfy bed and nice linens. It was toasty warm in the middle of winter and was super convenient. We ate out (the Palace's fish tacos can't be beat)--but a micro, hot pot, hot plate and coffee maker might come in handy for some visitors. Sweet touches such as instant oatmeal, tea, coffee pods, and granola bars were appreciated. Quiet neighborhood. Would definitely book again if the need arises.

Location was in a nice neighborhood just minutes from the school. Clean, cozy, and quiet! Communication was prompt and clear. I would absolutely stay there again!"

The room was cute and comfortable and very clean. The bed was extremely comfortable. I slept great and didn’t want to get up. They had the air conditioner going when we walked in so the room was a great temp, and they thought of all the little things you may need. There are some paint stains on the floor but nothing to be concerned about. You could hear the sound of children in the morning so if that is a concern for you it may not be the right place. But we loved it and would definitely stay here again!! Thank you Laina!"

Stayed one night","Laina went ahead and gave me a refund I didn't want, simply because we ran into some new information during my stay: the portable air conditioning unit is on the same breaker as the teakettle! :-) They are early risers, and their doorbell was malfunctioning, so I was unable to rouse them when I discovered this at 10:15 p.m. But I made do with my cell phone flashlight, and had a perfectly lovely stay in this clean, spacious, peaceful place. Before I even woke the next morning, I had a kind, apologetic e-mail from Laina, who is going to make sure the next guests can avoid inadvertent power outages.
I would happily stay here again (and pay for it, please!), and can recommend it for single travelers, couples, or small family groups (because of that fold-out bed next to the kitchenette in a separate room from the bedroom). Spotless, quiet, and with all kinds of great amenities, including suggestions of local attractions."

Pictures show space accurately. Nice & warm, even when cold outside. In-law type unit attached to left side of main house (could hear dog barking & piano practicing), but very private.
There's a single burner hot plate (picture 9) that you can pull out of the drawer. Hot water kettle, Keurig coffee maker, microwave, mini-fridge.
Bathroom is thru door shown on right side of picture 5. Small room with shower & toilet, no sink (use sink in main room). Good hot water, and works well.
Thank You...would definitely stay here again!"

Went straight to bed and woke up around 9:00 just in time to check-out at 10:00. Unfortunately, the rest of my crew did not show up so I had the entire place to myself and for only about half a day.
My length of stay was NOT in any way Taylor's fault/responsibility. The unit was clean, quiet, private.
No hesitation what so ever recommending Taylor's facility. Wish my circumstances would have allowed for a longer stay.
Taylor, Ya got a really nice place. I hope I get a chance to stay again.
