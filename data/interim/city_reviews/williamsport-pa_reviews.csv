Stayed a few nights","Excellent house for a girlfriend reunion while visiting our undergrad Lycoming College. Comfortable, quiet, four beds, two bathrooms, with super comfortable couch and soft seating. We weren’t there enough to enjoy/use the full and fairly stocked kitchen, outdoor seating, or backyard fields but it was nice knowing they were there. Duane was super responsive and helpful with any needs. We’d definitely return for another visit and highly recommend. Very clean and not cluttered at all. Two nights at a local two queen bed hotel would have cost more - plus at Duane’s we each had our own bed, 3 BRs, 2 bathrooms, kitchen access w/ coffee pot, and an amazing living room for long talks."

Group trip","Everything about this place was perfect. Nice size with ample space in the living room and kitchen for everyone to gather. The the bedrooms were good -- beds very comfortable. Lots of room to park in a nice quiet neighborhood. Easy to park. Duane was great to work with -- he communicated often and let us know everything we needed to know in a timely fashion. Especially appreciated the non GPS directions to the house. If you stay here, be sure to follow those closely. We really enjoyed our stay here."

Group trip","Our stay at Duane's place was perfect for our daughter's graduation from Lycoming College. The house is about 10 minutes from the college and away from the hustle and bustle of downtown Williamsport. We found everything to be clean, working, and accessible. No strange idiosyncrasies like having to use a work-around to anything. The house is at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac and backs up to a ball field with plenty of green space, and was very quiet and peaceful. Would definitely recommend and would stay here again. Thanks Duane!"

I'm used to RV kitchens and even without a full set up in the room it was perfect for making small meals and my morning coffee. I loved all the personal touches in the room.

It was a personal treat and I recommend this place to anybody who is looking for an inspirational place, wants to focus on a project or just to spend a good time. The factory at night feels almost surreal, there is art everywhere and if you meet any people outside the studio,they are all super friendly. There is a wonderful souvenir shop, you can spend easily an hour or two there. Coffee at the coffee shop is top notch. I really hope to stay there again."

Truly a unique, zen experience within a culturally diverse and thriving arts community. Be sure to visit the Rust and Shine for treasures and Buzz Saw for the best coffee and service!

Stayed a few nights","Atmospheres is a breath of fresh air! I travel for work, and I’m usually just looking for a place that I can get a peaceful night of sleep, the bed is comfortable, the sheets soft and clean, and I certainly did sleep well.
She has lots of amenities, and I really enjoyed having the desk/kitchen area to prepare my coffee and my breakfast, as well as having a table that made it feel more like home and less like camping or a hotel.
This apartment is most certainly full of good energy. It will absolutely encourage you to partake in some yoga, or be inspired by the art pieces surrounding you to create your own.
The building is incredible and the coffee shop downstairs if fantastic.
I could go on, but suffice to say I loved my Airbnb so much that I might just come back for pleasure instead of work 🥰"

Stayed a few nights","What a unique space! The host has really thoughtful of everything in this space and responds quickly. It is truly an artist loft which is beautifully decorated with lots of little touches. My 4 year old and I slept so peacefully in the comfy bed! The floor unit kept us perfectly cool in the hot summer.
The neighborhood is diverse with a mixture of grand Victorian style homes and even a bowling alley. Within 6 minutes from the PJ Factory we went on bicycle rides at the river, and had locally roasted coffee. Around every corner in the PJ Factory are cute space that just make you smile. So many plants, nooks, and spaces to read, play pool or other games! The court yard space is UNBELIEVABLE! So many beautiful plants and flowers! Lots of seating, outdoor grill, cornhole, and life size jenga.
I felt super safe and everyone I encountered was so nice. There's a soul food truck vendor literally right out side the door. I doubt you will find anything as interesting as this in the area."

Stayed a few nights","On a trip passing through Williamsport, I had the pleasure of being one of the first guests staying at this new Airbnb located in the Pajama Factory.
I used this Airbnb as a remote work location. Having the desk area inside allowed for a quiet base for remote work to take calls. Having the other amenities of the Pajama factory close by such as the Coffee Shop and outdoor courtyard allowed for additional work locations throughout the days. This location also was a great spot to have as a base to explore Williamsport after work. With being <10 min drive to downtown restaurants, and a short connection to the bike trail as well.
The Airbnb itself was charming and well-maintained. It was clean, comfortable, and cozy. The host was friendly and responsive. Staying at this Airbnb in the Pajama Factory was a memorable and enjoyable experience. This unique setting and cozy accommodation made it a great choice for a remote work getaway while passing through PA."

Really tastefully decorated and the giant window provides lots of natural morning light. Loft is in a former warehouse that has been converted to many artist studios and loft apartments. The hallways are rough wooden floors unchanged from the old factory, with art of all kinds everywhere. The Buzzsaw coffee shop that is connected to the building is fantastic, and has the strongest espresso I've ever had. And I've had a lot. Recommended."

Stayed a few nights","I booked Sara's loft at the Pajama Factory for 4 nights while I worked in the Williamsport area. I found the space very refreshing and well appointed. Residing in an old Pajama Factory made for a very unique stay. The whole property has an extremely positive energy. The timing for my stay here couldn't have been better. The day before my stay I had actually submitted my 2 week resignation letter to the company I have worked at for over 15 years. I will be making a fairly substantial career change in that I will be starting my own business. After getting the key from the lockbox and entering the building I step into the elevator and notice a plaque with a quote on it above the buttons: ""If at first you do succeed ... try something harder"". The last place I would have guessed to find such a powerful sign of motivational inspiration. I highly recommend this place."

Stayed with a pet","We really loved staying here. The host was kind, proactive, and had the place ready to go with only 20 minutes of notice from us booking to arrival. Great place to stay with our two pups - with plenty of areas nearby to take them out. I’d recommend staying here if you’ve got some down time — you’ll definitely want to wander the halls and check out all of the art. Grab a coffee and a book and spend some time in the gorgeous courtyard too.
My only complaint is that the couch is not stable or big enough for someone to sleep on. Thankfully we didn’t need it, but we would’ve been disappointed if we had."

Here’s the down side , I would be glad to pay a little more for better furniture and bed. What’s there is barely adequate I’m sorry to say 🥵 I get why Sara decided to furnish it the way she did but there is a lot of room for improvement 😢

Stayed a few nights","The host: Sara really does go above and beyond in response to both her human and canine guests' needs. Her responses are immediate, professional and effective. And it is clear that she cares greatly about the loft and her guests' experience there.
The loft: A true New York City loft...in Williamsport, PA?!
The Pajama Factory: Not at all a ""usual name"" for something in this part of the country, but it actually WAS the largest pajama factory in the world at one time (at the ground floor elevator entry, note the photos of Doris Day and Rock Hudson in the associated films). Now it is becoming a community, including artists' lofts, venues for local activities, and the best coffee brewer in the city. And, while staying in the Airbnb, you can walk (with your dog!) through hallways of original, beautiful, inspiring artwork! So difficult to believe that this is a real place!!!"

Stayed about a week","I’m a writer by profession, so writing an accurate description is not normally a challenge…but, this..Pajama Factory!?, has me stumped. Neither words nor photos can truly represent what this place is. I’ve lived in Tokyo, NYC, LA..and I haven’t ever come across anything like this before.
..and it is in Williamsport, PA, of all places…Wegmans Grocery Store is a big deal in this town.
But, hidden in plain sight, there is this incredibly restored factory with hallways full of artwork, and artists’ lofts, and supercool humans, and the best dogs! And this Airbnb is a real factory loft!?!? Like the kind that I’d only ever seen in movies or TV shows like Suits. And the whole place is accessible, from the curbless shower to the thoughtful open floor plan to the building elevator (which, itself, becomes a work of art after sundown). I really cannot thank Sara enough for presenting this space on Airbnb and for her impeccable hosting of this one-of-a-kind experience."

Sara was willing to drop off things we needed, but it would have been nice to need to ask for them.
The location is fantastic and it’s easy to check in/find the unit. The instructions were clear (even included photos) and Sara was available if we needed help (quick to respond).
While there are some additional comforts we would have appreciated, the value was great and we enjoyed our stay. We would recommend to anyone looking for a few easy going nights in Williamsport."

Make sure to walk the other floors at the Pajama Factory to see the artwork! Shout out to Rich at Naked Glass Studio who graciously invited us in to see his fabulous stained glass projects! We also highly recommend eating at Harvest Moon Family Restaurant.... don't let the convenience store and gas station fool you! The staff was welcoming, decor was cozy, and the food was amazing!!! (Hazlenut spread stuffed French toast ....wow!) Thank you, Sara, for a lovely and memorable stay!"

Stayed with a pet","If you are looking for a unique, local experience for your stay in the Susquehanna Valley, look no further - Sara’s space at the Pajama Factory was exactly what I was looking for. I’ve been staying in the area a few times a year for over a decade, and the last three years I’d found an Airbnb where the hosts became like family & I didn’t look elsewhere. They sold their home last year & I’ve been dreading trying to find somewhere else that didn’t feel like an impersonal, hotel chain experience - that also took dogs, & wasn’t more expensive than a hotel. I hit the jackpot finding this place - it was probably the coolest Airbnb I’ve ever stayed, actually. It was like staying in an artists’ collective/dorm, and getting an inside glimpse into the art scene in Williamsport which I had no idea was so robust. The actual building itself was so cool - I could’ve spent another 3 days just exploring and taking photos. The courtyard has multiple seating areas, for rain or shine. The studio itself has big, beautiful windows that look out onto the courtyard - they were my favorite part of the space for sure. Cool bathroom with nice rain shower & detachable shower head, little stove & fridge, cool wood floors & art throughout the space - Sara makes stained glass pieces and I actually bought one she had in her window because it was so beautiful! The space was great for my dogs, & it was the perfect setup for 1 or 2 people to make a temporary home. My iPhone wouldn’t work with the plug for the TV so if TV is a must for you, might want to make sure you bring the right equipment to be able to plug in! Also would recommend packing as light as possible if you’re only one person staying - you’ll need to bring everything through the courtyard, past 2 locked doors, up an elevator & down the hall so making more than a trip or two might be a bit much! Sara is super responsive and helpful; I needed help figuring out how to open the window, then wanted hiking suggestions, and she always responded in a timely and helpful manner! People/artists I encountered in the building were all very friendly and welcoming. All in all this Airbnb was a total WIN for me and I look forward to coming back!"

The light play in the building is amazing for taking photographs, the artists-in-residence are very friendly and accommodating, and it is very fun to explore the wide array of art displays throughout the factory. The host shared very good directions for check-in, which are more detailed than most. I loved that we could bring our dog with us and walk to Peg & Bill's Diner for breakfast in the morning. Also, be sure to visit Mr. Sticky's for the world's most decadent cinnamon buns."

The inside spaces are lined with art displayed by the artists living in the apartments. It was an enjoyable walk around the two floors before we left. Our apartment was comfortable, well set up and provided a comfortable bed, shower and sitting area. We enjoyed our overnight stay."

Lots of room for sitting in different areas (couch, chairs, table, etc) which made it easy for my husband and I to get some work done. Great little nooks outside in the courtyard as well. Definitely recommend staying there! Sara was also incredibly attentive when we asked for a few items."

So be prepared for a short schlep to get your stuff from the car to the unit. I brought a lot of stuff and stayed five nights. And, Sara was responsive, helpful and delightful. Highly recommend!"

Stayed one night","We had a great time exploring the Pajamas factory. It was such a fun unique place to stay for the night. It was very quiet and at night it got dark which was great for sleeping. It also had a AC unit which was key for a good nights sleep as well. The apartment was clean and even had snacks,coffees and teas. The only downside for us was that we like to walk everywhere so it was a little far out of town but we knew that when we booked it. We walked downtown for dinner but got a Lyft back since it is kinda far. Great stay for the price!"

Stayed a few nights","Wonderful stay at Sara’s loft inside an old factory now repurposed an artistic haven. As a photographer I can definitely appreciate the vibe and history of it, it is one if the most unique places I stayed at.
Otherwise furnished with all the modern amenities you could ask for. The TV might not have cable, but that’s not what I traveled to Williamsport for, and I brought my iPad anyways; so I could spend the little free time I had streaming shows with a good wifi connection.
The Pajama Factory also felt very safe. Which was a great plus for me as I was on my way back home from the NY side of Niagara Falls (which unfortunately didn’t feel safe despite the beautiful scenery).
I would highly recommend Sara’s loft for anyone traveling to Williamsport, especially if you appreciate art and history."

Stayed a few nights","Though unique and different, overall this place just needs to be better maintained.
Kitchen table had a few broken support arms.
TV was small and, worst of all, was inoperable since there was no in-coming cable line.
Oven hadn't been cleaned well in some time- open the broiler, and the top was caked with dust.
Stainless steel cabinets - not a good idea. Hard to keep clean and shiny, and it showed.
You work a space with what you've got, but the fridge placement was awkward and made access a bit clumsy.
Garbage can was full and hadn't been emptied. Not good.
Some of the furniture hadn't been vacuumed and had pet hair.
Nice to have a CD player, speakers and a variety of CD's, but this doesn't help much when the player itself was inoperable. Checked the electrical lines, the outlet, played with the buttons - no go. Didn't work.
Toilet seat wasn't screwed down properly and was very loose.
A peak behind pictures and knick-knacks placed against the various sills showed layers of dust and cobwebs.
So - yeah - this space needed a MUCH better cleaning.
On the positive side, and most important to me - the bed was comfortable. I slept well.
The surroundings had a very cool, bohemian feel to it.
Most of the third floor, where the unit is located, was occupied by small businesses, which made for quiet evenings.
Unit access directions were spot on.
The variety of games, decorations and odds and ends were eclectic and appreciated.
It was very hot outside but the AC unit was adequate."

First, Sara was incredibly communicative, it was easy to check in, and the pajama factory is such an amazing place. there is inspiring artwork both in the apt and all around. there are trails and hiking all around this spot and the place was clean, exactly as pictured, and an inspiring place. the courtyard that you walk through has every detail you could think of and is so relaxing to walk through after a long day of work. the apt was so well lit from unique and amazing original windows from the factory and overall it was an incredible experience from start to finish that I would gladly do again! Laundry is around the corner and easy to use and Sara was so helpful not only in suggestions but in any inquries. for example the washing machine went down and she was quick to respond and setup a fix for it! I would HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone looking to be in a unique, inspiring, and wonderful apt. Thanks so much for having me!"

Stayed a few nights","Fantastic—in a word. There is something very special about these accommodations that deserves explaining, concerning the “inner” and “outer” experience. First, the inner: it’s a studio, but a larger one that the pictures seems to show. There is plenty of space for a 2 people (we are a couple, in our early 60s), tall ceilings and a large, light-filled window occupying the better part of one wall. As for the outer experience: this third-floor studio is one part of a great whole, the Pajama Factory building, which is the vision—wholly realized, and ongoing—of an artist/community/commercial “happening” that doesn’t just fulfil a community (and human) need for such a place, but has, one can tell, helped bring it into being. To walk the halls on several floors is to feel a part of “art in progress,” not to mention all the artwork on display to admire. My feeling is that Williamsport is a significantly better place for its existence. (As to the activity in the building: have no concern, there is quiet and politeness throughout—you really get the sense that the people who come and go are truly happy to be a part of this.) And then fully outside: Williamsport is a cool little town, good restaurants, a river walk, other notable buildings and neighborhoods…and then beyond, the PA Grand Canyon area and state/other parks with hiking to impressive heights for amazing views—all within 20 – 30 minutes: this is a part of PA and our country that really deserves exploration…but which you can be sure will never be overrun and overcommercialized. Really a great experience!"

The only confusion was that there was no driveway but we made due with parking in the street, in addition the patio umbrella was not set up but the owner told us where it was in the shed. The pillows on the couch were a little scratchy, but nothing we couldn’t handle. The chairs in the living room were slightly uncomfortable as well. However, the backyard was beautiful with flowers and beautifully manicured. The natural lighting was nice and appreciated the backyard being gated for our service animals which she so kindly accepted. The beds were very comfortable as well. Overall 9/10 experience! Thank you so much and would be more than happy to stay again!"

We spent most of our time in the home but did wander off to Reptile Land and had dinner at a local restaurant with our kids. The space was perfect! It was spacious and felt cozy sitting in the living room. The beds were so comfy my 2 year old managed to take a 3 hour nap and actually slept the whole night! It was great because that left time for my husband and I to watch some movies on netflix. We even played ping pong in the basement ! Overall a very special space that Camille has. It was nice to see a picture of her grandparents in the kitchen. The space felt like there was a lot of love there and certainly has character to it. Thank you for hosting us. We’ll be back soon 😊💕

The house was well-appointed, very clean, easy to find, and within a short walk of the town center and a number of fine restaurants. Leslie's directions for entering the housexwere clear and she was very understanding when we had to delay our departure by half an hour because of a minor illness. I would happily stay here again."

Stayed with kids","Generally, very good. It is very convenient to get to - right off the street with 1 parking spot right in front of the the apartment. Easy loading and unloading. Leslie very responsive to communication which is a big plus.
It is right on the street, so typical street noise, which late at night was tough with little kids sleeping.
Place was as described with 2 nice bedrooms. Living room furniture is small, not real comfortable. Beds were fine. Shower was very small but the rest of the bathroom was nice. Kitchen area was nice with available coffee, snacks.
Cost is high but if you would need 2 separate rooms (i.e. 2 hotel rooms) this works out a little better."

We were thankful to have this option and would definitely stay here again!"

Staying here allowed us to still visit family and bring our fir baby with us. And you are within walking distance to everything down town including some grocery stores. We also loved at pets are not allowed on the furniture which helps keep everything clean. Perfect for two couples or a family coming to Williamsport who want to be right downtown."

There are no steps. The location is also great a few blocks walking distance from stores and restaurants on the main strip--we attended the First Fridays events. We especially enjoyed the weekly Saturday morning farmers' market taking place just across the parking lot. We will be back in the spring."

The location was perfect and was only a short walk to restaurants, bars, and the theater. I was hesitant to book due to having a parking lot next door, but it was surprisingly quiet and not at all problematic.

Stayed about a week","Honestly, not impressed with this Airbnb (the previous reviews had me fooled). Upon arriving, the place looks run down with trash all over the yard/ in the bushes. Once entering, it’s dark and musty. Majority of the cute homey decor has been removed. Upon making dinner my first night, there was food splattered all inside the microwave and crusted onto one of the utensils I attempted to use. They provide one kitchen towel and no paper towels to supplement. I took out the garbage— tons of trash and I don’t want to know what in the bottom under the bag, so gross! Bed was fine (not sure why previous reviews raved about it), but you hear every car passing by with the AC unit in the window making it nearly impossible to sleep even with a white noise machine. Further, several items were advertised in the listing/photos and were NOT provided: printer/ workspace, salt and pepper, extra bedding/ blankets and most importantly a fire extinguisher. As a Airbnb host myself, I was quite disappointed."

Stayed a few nights","First, watch your head going up the stairs. I'm just shy of six feet and I will hit it every time if I don't duck. There is no cable or streaming so bring your own laptop or notebook and HDMI cable if you want to stream Netflix or other streaming. The WIFI is pretty fast. The A/C consists of two window units which can be a bit loud. But they both work efficiently. The bed is great. The kitchen is good and well stocked with the essential kitchen gear. There is no dishwasher nor any kitchen table, just a bar for two. It's a very old house but has been nicely updated and is clean and everything in the apartment is in good work order. Overall, we had a pleasant stay."

Stayed one night",My stay at this property was horrible. I was burglarize because of an extra key being left outside under a Buddha fixed so there was no forced entry. The owner claim to not know about the hidden key and this was separate to the front door that was never mention along identical to the key in the lock box. When confront the host said his ring cameras were off and he couldn’t help me at all so I ended up loosing all my birthday gifts and valuables. Worst Airbnb stay and host ever. Most likely an inside job

Stayed one night","Our stay here was just what we needed. It felt like you were staying in someone's home and that they would walk through the door at any minute. We enjoyed the memorabilia that was throughout the house, giving us lots to look at and think about the lives that lived there. It was a cozy, clean home and we loved all it had to offer, a great kitchen, a covered porch (it was rainy) and we all enjoyed playing guitar hero on the wii. We were there for my sons graduation from PCT, and it was a great place to gather the night before the ceremony to share a meal, some good conversation, lots of laughs and time together as a family. I think Skip and Tutty would have loved that our family had the chance to enjoy their beautiful home making memories of our own like many of the memories I am sure they made. Thanks for sharing you home with us."

Stayed one night","Overall, recommended! This is a truly sweet family home turned nicely into an Airbnb. Pics of loved ones are still on the walls, but it's also chock-a-block with nice Airbnb touches — labels on everything, nibbles in the kitchen, clear instructions, etc. Cozy warm beds, good wifi, modern TV, friendly and communicative hosts — I was only there one night, but quite liked it.
Only two small caveats — the house is close to a major interstate-sized highway, so close the windows tightly if you value quiet, and it's facing a huge Pepsi warehouse, so you're not going for any scenic walks in that direction. But that said, if you're passing through town or planning to drive to an event nearby, this is a definite yes — it *is* quiet, it *is* cute, it *is* well set up... so I'd definitely stay again."

Easy to find in downtown central Williamsport, Pennsylvania, located in a quiet neighborhood. Todd's instructions throughout the home were easy to follow and maintain. He even went above board with stocking the kitchen with some grocery items and had labels on all the kitchen cabinets and drawers identifying where items were located. My family and I highly recommend this Airbnb for a stay in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. We will definitely stay in it again when the opportunity presents itself."

Rt. 15 is within view and we were only a few minutes from downtown and campus. The place is very nostalgic with a feeling of being at your grandparents again. It's very quaint. And there were rabbits and squirrels on the lawn area. The back porch is nice. And the hospitality - all the pantry items and even some other goodies and coffee - was a definite bonus.

The breakfast items provided were above and beyond any of my expectations. If yours in the Williamsport area I would highly recommended spending your time there."

Stayed with a pet","This is one of the most charming AirBnbs that I've stayed in. It is a family home that feels like walking into your Grandparent's home where they have photos of their family everywhere, artwork from their children and grandchildren, and some really cool artifacts from their life. The space was incredibly clean and had the most well-stocked kitchen I've ever seen at an Airbnb. The yard is completely fenced in which was really nice since we were traveling with our dog. The tree in the front yard is easily 80-100 years old and it is simply stunning. The owner builds on the charm of this old tree by having a glider underneath with patio lights hung from the lower branches. It was a peaceful place to relax and unwind after a long day of travel."

Everything we needed was there and then some. We were celebrating our daughter’s college graduation, so having a steamer for her wrinkly gown really came in handy.
She wanted a home cooked meal after the ceremony, and the labels on all of the drawers and cabinets helped me navigate the kitchen. Having two bathrooms also made it to easier for the four of us to get ready in the morning as well.
All in all, a very comfortable stay."

The pepsi plant with trucks nextdoor is a little busy in the morning and the interstate is visible from window over the kitchen sink but all the other advantages and perks of this place make those two things minor matters. Really great place to stay and relax. And we had the luck of the leprechauns greeting us throughout our three day stay with the holiday decorations...definitely a nice surprise!"

The house was well equipped with kitchenware and even included some basic breakfast needs which we really appreciated since we arrived late at night.
Todd was great to communicate with because he was thorough and quick.
The host pictures are accurate and everything was clean and in its place.
We would recommend staying here to anyone with a family that needs a little more space than a hotel can offer."

There is a ton of space. I was just one person, but this place could accommodate a clan very easily.
FYI, the house and back yard/deck are lovely. The house is on an industrial-feeling alley and right next to the highway. VERY convenient access to get the next leg of a trip started (Rickett’s Glen and World’s End, in my case!), but this isn’t the spot for charm of the overall setting.
This place was perfect for my needs and exceeded my expectations. Thanks for the breakfast items! An English muffin with peanut butter and banana was a nice start to a full day of hiking!"

Stayed a few nights",My coworker and I spent 5 days here while we met with clients in and around Williamsport. Marks place had everything we could have asked for and more. But what stood out the most for me was the WIFI. Fastest internet I've ever experienced in any accommodations(outside of my own home) and I have traveled extensively over the past 15 years with my job position. I was clocking 340Mpbs on WIFI and over 400Mpbs with wired connection. I highly recommend using Mark's place if staying in Williamsport.

Melissa and Ray were excellent hosts. They communicated well with us and went out of their way to ensure that our stay was comfortable. We loved having the grill outside and the large porch. We had several dinners out there.
We came out to explore the area on both motorcycles and bicycles and found great roads, beautiful vistas and interesting places to eat. The house worked very well for us- private,off road parking let us keep the bikes off the street at night.
The neighborhood is good, very residential but close to restaurants (especially across the river in Williamsport), highways, supermarkets and the Riverwalk. Be sure to check out the Riverwalk, a cool way to explore the river and get some exercise."

The beds were comfortable. There one plush, and two firm. One room has the adjustable bed which my daughter loved. I will definitely be staying again"

The 2 dedicated parking spaces were an unexpected bonus. The loft itself is clean, spacious, and has a great layout that provides an open concept feel with 3 private bedrooms on the upper floor. The salon on the ground floor has business hours 7 days per week, but the noise is minimal. The downtown area is quiet all night and at times restaurant and bar patrons can be heard but nothing was disruptive or disturbing. The “city” feel is evident in the loft design, but the actual downtown is simple to navigate, whether driving or walking. I highly recommend Marisa’s space!"

Stayed with kids","Marisa's place is located in center of Williamsport, within walking distance to multiple restaurants, coffee shops, and scenic walks along the Susquehanna River. Access to the apartment is limited to an alleyway parking lot which is a little dodgy-feeling after dark. The place itself is cavernous - literally humongous - with thoughtful amenities for a small group looking to unwind, including board games, air hockey, and tabletop shuffleboard. The kitchen is serviceable, though not sufficient for cooking dinner for a large group of people due to limited preparation space and inadequate appliances. The bedrooms are large and comfortable, though the street-facing rooms are loud due to the fact that they face the main drag. All in all a great place!"

There's plenty of room in the house for both sleeping along with activities during the day. We spend most of the day down in the creek which is perfectly situated off the back yard. We also really like grilling up dinner on the back patio and eating in the sun room. Last but not least the two firepit options are great depending on what kind of campfire mood you're in or how much energy is left after a day in the creek."

Convenient location to the popular restaurant, Pier 87, an ice cream shop, and grocery stores. Within an hour of many activities such as Pine Creek Rail Trail, Ricketts Glenn, Disc Golf, and many other hiking and Mountain Biking Trails.
Nice water hole in the Creek where people were either flyfishing or reel fishing. Many Bald Eagles were observed. something I don't see often in my area of Michigan.

Stayed with kids","Creekside Manor is the perfect place for a winter getaway! It had snowed before we got there so it felt like we were in a real winter wonderland!
And getting the fire going in the fireplace was a real treat.
Michael is a great host and incredibly communicative. His local guidebook has great suggestions. We got some of the delicious sticky buns from Mr. Sticky’s and also hiked the beautiful Katey Jane trail in Rider Park.
Great house for families! We hope to be back!"

We used all 3 fireplaces. The beautiful stone indoor wood burning one was my favorite. We waded in the creek every day, it was unseasonably warm for October. Every detail of this home is thoughtful and well appointed. Do not hesitate, go ahead and book this home! You will not be disappointed!"

Stayed with kids","Absolutely perfect getaway for our multi-family Labor Day weekend getaway. We had 6 kids with us, and the bunk bed room was perfect for the older ones and TV room perfect for the younger kids in the mornings. The creek behind the house is the main attraction with a section that's shallow and calm enough for kids to play in and a deeper section farther out with a current that's perfect for tubing or swimming. *Invest in some water shoes as the ground below the water is smooth but slippery rocks* There was plenty of firewood which we enjoyed for campfire cooked lunches and smores later in the evening. The house is well stocked with all the pots/pans/plates we needed to cook dinner, and the sun room has a folding table and chairs that worked well for our 'kids table'. All in all a great place and a great host."

Stayed about a week","We had a great week at Creekside Manor. The location can't be beat: right on the Loyalsock Creek and very close to Weis Markets and Walmart. We did an initial stock-up at Wegmans in Williamsport on the way.
This was a social distancing vacation for us. We hiked every day, from local spots like Rider Park and Jacoby Hallow, to further but totally driveable destinations such as Leonard Harrison State Park, Colton Point State Park, Ricketts Glen State Park, and Worlds End State Park.
Our adult daughter, whom we hadn't seen since November due to the pandemic, joined us from NYC for a workcation. She had her Zoom meetings in the yard, in the sunroom, in the tv room...someplace different than her apartment bedroom!
She joined us some days for hiking and every evening for our other favorite activity: floating on the creek. It was a most relaxing way to end each day.
We had excellent communication with our host, Micheal, both before and during our stay. His guidebook was very helpful to us in planning where to go. Creekside Manor was extremely clean.
We definitely would recommend Creekside Manor to anyone who wants to get away from it all, but still be close to grocery stores and outdoor attractions."

Group trip","Creekside Manor is a great location if you’re in town for a wedding at Herman & Luther’s. We were in town for our niece’s wedding and we were less than 10 minutes from the venue. It is a cute, rustic home and we enjoyed our stay. The only issue is that the house doesn’t have WiFi and there is very limited to no cell service so that made it tough to receive texts from other family members staying at other locations but the host does disclose that the home doesn’t have WiFi. There are two landline phones in the home and you are provided with the number so you can receive calls. Our kids enjoyed skipping rocks down at the creek. If you want to get away from the hustle and bustle, you’ll really enjoy Creekside Manor. Michael is a very responsive host."

Stayed with kids","We stayed at the Creekside Manor while in the area for our daughter's college graduation. We LOVED the location with the creek so close (the weather cooperated a couple of days). The house is modern rustic - the beds were comfortable, every room had it's own charm and the kitchen had a variety of spices available which makes cooking very easy. We enjoyed our stay so much that we were disappointed that we won't be heading back to that area. Sitting and relaxing on that wooden swing, watching our granddaughter try to skip rocks like her dad - it was perfect! We also enjoyed the Hibachi restaurant very much and the Eders Ice Cream was awesome - way too much ice cream for $3 - even a Lactose-Free option, which is quite unusual. If you fish, bring your poles - Walmart is just up the road for a license and bait. You won't be disappointed ;-)"

Stayed with kids","What a fantastic stay our family of 9 had at Creekside Manor! The property is easy to find with Mike's clear directions that even included a few pictures of landmarks on the way. It was perfectly cleaned before our arrival and the check-in process was simple. A detailed note on the kitchen table answered any and all questions about the house itself and Mike was so helpful before and during our stay, providing extra info on the surrounding area and the best places to eat and visit. Our family is from this area but didn't know anything about Forksville (and their delicious steak subs) or World's End State Park with the cool Rock Garden and stunning views of the valley.
The house was spacious with plenty of room for our 2 families to stay and many friends and relatives to stop by for visits. There are plenty of spaces to sit around and chat or relax, (especially the family room, kitchen and outdoor backyard seating areas) play games and eat. There is a closet with a stack of games for all ages!
I loved the attention to detail throughout this house. Nice fixtures, any appliance you can think of needing, a large refrigerator, pantry and even a folding table and drying rack in the basement laundry room. To me, one of the best details was the ample supply of hooks and towel racks in the bathrooms and bedrooms! We've stayed at many vacation homes through the years and nobody seems to think about a large group of people all taking showers in the morning and having so many wet towels and washcloths that need to hang dry. It seems like a small thing but we really appreciated your forethought on this and many other things Mike and Sherri!
The Creek itself and perfect fire pit were among our favorite places to hang out with family, friends and relatives. There is plenty of outdoor lighting around the house also if you need it for night time activities. S'mores, Hotdogs and Jiffy Pop Popcorn done on the fire (built with the ample supply of kindling and wood provided), catching (and releasing) crayfish in the creek and fireflies at night brought our minds back to our childhoods and gave our kids a great experience they never get to have in Florida or Houston. I'm sure they'll remember this time far into adulthood!
The check-out process was simple as well. There is a list posted on the fridge noting the few simple things that need to be done before leaving.
We certainly will stay at Creekside Manor whenever we visit up in PA - Great House, Great Host - it could not have been more perfect!
Sincerely,
Sheryl, Lisa, Jim Rice and families"

The pristine water and air that funnels down through the Loyalsock valley was very refreshing and rejuvenating, making this a perfect getaway. We look forward to visiting again in the future."

We only stayed for a short period so we didn’t get to explore too much but there were a ton of trendy restaurants and shops within a 5 minute drive. Barbara sent us all of the information we needed ahead of time and when I emailed to ask if we could check in a little early we she responded quickly and it was no problem at all. Thank you again for such a great stay!"

For me, it was a good place to get away for a bit. The apartment itself is spacious and nice, and very well put together, with a kitchen (includes fridge, microwave, cookingware, stove, plates, etc., pretty much everything you'd need out of a kitchen), bathroom, little living area and dining area, and bedroom with a workspace and TV. The bed is very comfortable, and overall, everything was great.
For parking, you can park your car right in front of the apartment door, which is convenient. There's a small gravel driveway you can park your car down.
Matt is very friendly, and gave clear instructions for how to get in.
I had a dog and a cat with me, and they both were also able to live well in the space. Pet-friendly space, set up well for it.
Overall, great for the value."

Stayed over a week",The place was fantastic! Everything was clean and there was plenty of space. Matt was a great host! He frequently reached out to ask if I needed anything and was available when anything came up.
