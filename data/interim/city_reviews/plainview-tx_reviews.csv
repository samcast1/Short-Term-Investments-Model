We were in town for a family event and needed a place to stay and this house was close to everything and it was really peaceful at night. Getting in was easy and the house had everything we needed for a few people. The master bed was very comfortable and the wifi was great as well. My only complaint is that the sliding door to the master bathroom is a bit tough to open/close but that's just a minor issue. We appreciated the snacks and overall coziness of the house and we would definitely stay here again in the future!

Loved that the light switches were labeled it was just that extra touch to let you know she cared. We will definitely be back and want to see more of Apryll's properties

Group trip","It’s a good place to stay. It looks big in pictures but wasn’t as big as I thought. A really cute place, great space and had all that we needed except space and a large living room. Really enjoyed staying here. If it’s extremely cold the floor is very cold and it takes the heater time to catch up but the house will normally be a great temperature. We just happened to be there when it was extremely cold outside. We were thankful to find the extra blankets that were provided.
It’s easy to get to, is close to everything you need in town and has a really cool sun room and big back yard with a fire pit to sit around. I would easily stay here again and probably will."

Stayed a few nights",The master bed was broken down and was sagging in the middle. There was not hot water in the master shower. There was water coming up around the wax seal in both bathrooms that flooded the master bedroom that we had to clean during the middleof the the night and raw sewage coming up in the showers. We were offered a place to go take showers and we were brought more clean towels since we used the ones we had to clean the floors. This happened the night before Thanksgiving so no plumber was available. Owner was responsive to messages. Home was nice other than those problems. We stay in Tulia about once a year and we would consider renting from her again.

This is an older home with crooked walls and cracked cielings, but has been cleaned nicely and repainted. For the price it can't be beat, especially the proximity to where we were hunting.

We received instructions that we would get instructions on how to find the home, but did not get those ahead of time. We were traveling across the state, so we had to unfortunately call the host late at night when we couldn't find the home, but they were very helpful then. For anyone renting this Airbnb in the future, there are two streets with the same name in the same new home subdivision, so if you don't find the first time around, the rest of the street is further down, after an undeveloped field."

Stayed about a week",We needed a place close to who we visited in Shallowater. Shallowater has limited restaurants so plan around that. Lysha's food truck food in town is very very good but she is not open every day. The locations was quiet. Very rarely do you get a two car garage and we used the space to work on our project. The house is practically new. 15 minutes from West Lubbock. We will probably stay there again in the not too distant future.

Stayed a few nights","The Good: The home was very clean with a newly remodeled kitchen and bathroom with new appliances and a full size washer and dryer. Shower was excellent. The beds were comfortable and offered a great nights rest. I selected this home based on the wheel chair accessibility which allowed for my daughter (paraplegic) to visit. She was able to access the home and maneuver though the front door (a big plus), but the bathroom door was too narrow for her wheel chair.
The Bad: The home is located in an older section of Plainview and much of the neighborhood is on the run down side. There were loose dogs running the neighborhood including a Pit who spent most of his time on the front porch. Omar has invested in the remodel but the house lacks any decorating. A lamp on the bedside tables and some wall decor would go a long ways in making the functional house a little more homey."

I liked he didn’t have crazy checkout rules, etc. Home was a little older so maybe that is why it was so cold. That is my only complaint, which is more of a me problem, but I felt like the home wasn’t getting warm. Other than that.. I would definitely stay if Omar allowed!"

Was in town for Graduation, and Omar’s home is ideally located only a 5 min drive from the university. I do have to mention however, it was very cold and although the centralized heater worked great, unless kept on the home would loose heat quickly. Then again, I’m easily cold so it could very well just be my opinion."

Stayed with kids","The neighborhood is peaceful. What you would expect in Plainview. House is close to everything.
Not very appealing to be in the house or come in. Curbside is not attractive.
The house is old, tried to update but there are some issues that need fixing.
There was a leak in kitchen my husband had to fix it. The house smelled very bad, smells like mold. We had to leave the windows open and spray to help with the smell. The flooring is falling apart, not done well, I think the mold smell may be coming from under the flooring. Lots of bugs and cockroaches.
Theres nowhere to put your stuff in the bedrooms, no closet or dresser.
The one closet in one bedroom had a dirty smelly mop & used as a utility closet.
There’s some work to be done to the house and I think once that is done it will be a better stay."

Stayed a few nights","Overall, the pictures match where you’re staying. There’s pros & cons.
Pros: good location, good size house, easy check-in, comfortable pretty standard home.
Cons:
1) there’s lots of flies/gnats and other insects INSIDE the house and the host does provide fly swatters and bug spray, but me personally, that’s an inconvenience.
2) We got there at night and the area is SUPER DARK. No street light, so we passed it twice before finally seeing the house.
3) this is the biggest con to me. The host doesn’t state on his post “no pets”. I have a service animal, so naturally he goes with me. Instead of the host reaching out to me personally about my animal, he complained very quickly to AirBNB and their support team messaged me. It was a whole mess and the whole weekend I felt uneasy on if I had to look elsewhere or not. I personally felt like he should of just messaged me to discuss. And then to say at the end he is thinking about welcoming pets, I felt annoyed. I wouldn’t stay here again."

We made our own breakfast and sometimes dinner. There were five of us females, so sharing one bathroom was a challenge but we made it work. The beds were great, but a little high for my shorter siblings (a stepping stool would have been nice). The house was great and so was the owner when we contacted her. We would definitely stay there again."

Stayed one night","This hidden gem was such a pleasure to stay in! This was the perfect location for our adventures in the Caprock Canyon region. This guest home is remote, quiet and private. The sunrises and sunsets are similar to watercolor paintings - amazing visuals! The stars are indescribable and awe-inspiring. The wrap around porch is an awesome touch and we likely would've used it if it hadn't been a windy 40 degree night during our stay. The inside of the home is nothing short luxurious. You immediately feel comfortable and taken care of upon entry. The hosts were very thoughtful in the design and amenities of this place. We didn't need for anything. Enjoy the bath - it's excellent! I would recommend grocery shopping prior to arrival to ensure you have what you need - the restaurant scene in Nazareth and surrounding is nonexistent. Lol. The history behind the hosts, the land and the guest home are so amazing. Thank you for sharing your slice of heaven with us! If you're passing through-Book it!"

Stayed a few nights",First of all this was not like staying at an airbnb property. This was like staying at your best friends house. There are so many things that they provide in the casita. I won't go through the list but take my word for it. Because I'm a airbnb host myself. The history behind the family and property are worth the visit and stay on its own. coming from Dallas we stopped at Caprock and spent the day. We stayed at the cabin 4 nights and went to Palo Duro for 3 days. Then stopped at Caprock again on our way back to Dallas. But we did stay the night in Childress on the way back. They you for the wonderful stay and will join you again next time we are in the area. cheers

Each time I thought “they thought of everything” another nice surprise awaited. It was so quiet and the furnishings were gorgeous. I cant lie; the saddle was the deciding factor as it incorporated my love for horses. The hosts were very responsive and everything was as described plus some. Ladies - that bathtub is to die for. The sunset was a nice bonus. We were able to chat with the owner’s uncle while there. He was the nicest man and my husband thoroughly enjoyed learning the history of the casita and he was so impressed with the workmanship. Thank you Ryan and Gina for making our 30th anniversary trip so special."

The casita has a porch that wraps around the entire space and is a great place to relax, unwind, and enjoy. The casita made the perfect getaway! It is located about an hour away from state and private parks. It was a great base location to explore the area. Gina and Ryan were the best hosts!

Stayed a few nights","We had a good stay. The house is spacious & well furnished. The game room in the basement was a plus for the grandkids, but we were never able to get the TV in that room to work. There's a TV in the living room with no remote to go with it, luckily the remote to the non working TV was used. Apryll was nice enough to bring out an iron/ironing board after we checked in. She also was very accommodating in allowing us to have a small dinner to celebrate our grandson's graduation.
There was one big negative during our stay, but it did make it rather uncomfortable... the whole house was full of dust & cobwebs, especially around & under the beds, and it smelled musty, like it hadn't been aired out or cleaned in some time. I think the cleaning staff needs to pay more attention to those cleaning details as the dust caused alot of throat dryness & irritation to all of us staying in the house. I'm guessing the house had not been rented in some time. House shdve been cleaned before check in."

The spacious living room/ dining & kitchen/ game area were perfect. The back yard was large and ideal for the two yard games we brought. The pool table and foosball table in the game room offered enjoyable, competitive entertainment. We cooked burgers on the grill one evening and a spaghetti dinner another evening, and were able to all come together at the large (eight seats) dining room table. The house was spotlessly clean, had plenty of quality large bath towels, and nice bed linens. We visit Tulia two to three times a year, and will definitely stay here every time."

As tenured airbnbers this was our absolute favorite place!
So impressed with all the details throughout the house that kept it on theme without making it cheesy.
The hot tub under the stars was fantastic and breathtaking.
The location was gorgeous, serene, and secluded without having to drive too far outside of a major city.
We had fun playing the provided mini golf, laying out in the hammocks, rocking in the chairs on the wrap around upper deck porch, and gathering around fire pit. There was also a grill and a tent provided, that we unfortunately didn’t have time to use. Ches provided so many amenities that it was easy to stay-in and vacation there without just making it a landing spot after driving to other destinations on our getaway.
Ches was the perfect host, was excellent at prompt communication, and you could tell he wanted to make sure all his guest have the best time at his “Saloon”.
We already want to be back!"

The skylight above the bed where one can look at the stars, along with the cozy electric fireplace in the loft bedroom, lends to a contemplative ambience. The outdoor fire pit would be great for making S'mores with the kids. Too bad I didn't have them with me, but hopefully on another trip. The tiny home is in a quiet area where the stars are your company. It makes for a great stay! I hope to make another stay there. Chesley is a great host! He communicates well, is responsive, and obviously takes great care of his place. He was a pleasure to deal with."

How to even fit into words how much we loved this place will be a challenge. Ches’s place was amazing and more than I had even imagined! His attention to detail around the place as well as with the reservation and stay its self was phenomenal. My husband and I throughly enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere and even wrote a song together while there (musicians). We have already started planning to come back when it’s warmer and we can utilize more of the outdoor amenities besides just the amazing hot tub. I’ve also started sending the link to the Sunset Saloon to other friends in this area as well as those farther away that have started a “wish list” of unique Airbnb locations they want to visit. We couldn’t have asked for a better stay; from the location, amenities, cleanliness and responsiveness of the host than what received at the saloon!"

I didn’t get to use the hot tub due to the weather but it Had everything I needed and more! Location is Completely secluded and peaceful away from it all but still only 15 min to the nearest grocery store! Don’t miss out on staying here if you’re in the area!! 5 ⭐️

Stayed a few nights","This is the best Air BNB that I have ever stayed at. My husband and I just got married and decided to go here for our “mini-moon.” It was such a great decision. The bathroom was spotless, everything you could need or might have forgotten was somewhere in the kitchen.
The country western aesthetic is so much cuter in person and the pictures already look great. We definitely want to come back and stay again. It was so peaceful and at night you can see rabbits on the property. The stars were also crazy beautiful out there because of the lack of light pollution.
So peaceful and warm. 10/10 stay for sure and I’m recommending to everyone. I hardly ever write long reviews but this was worth it."

Stayed with kids","My kids and I used the saloon as a “home base” to hiking the state parks nearby. I didn’t tell them about the uniqueness beforehand and pulling up to it, they were so surprised!
Everything was clean, tidy, and even better than I thought it would be. We had up to 50mph wind gusts two days/nights, so it wasn’t ideal for being outside, but once the wind died down, we hung out on the patio and it was great.
Coffee in the morning watching the sunrise and a glass of wine at night watching the sunset and seeing the stars was a peaceful break I needed. My kids have asked to make this actually trip."

The only downside is it is farther from Palo Duro state park and Amarillo than we thought based off the listing. Palo duro is about a 35/40 minute drive and depending on where in Amarillo you’re going it’s 45 minutes. Not a deal breaker but was farther than we were hoping from Palo Duro. Otherwise the stay was great, lots of little wildlife around and beautiful view of the stars on a clear night. Ches was super helpful and quick to answer any questions!"

We are absolutely coming back and I am recommending it to everyone.

Stayed a few nights","We were thankful to find this two bedroom, one bath home in Plainview.
Definitely better than staying in a hotel room.
The house was quite clean, which we appreciated very much.
Everything we needed was provided, just took a little searching sometimes.
The Wi-Fi worked well and the workspace was handy.
Shelby had alerted us a couple of days ahead of time that her current refrigerator had stopped working, so we really appreciated the effort she made to get a brand new refrigerator set up before we arrived.
As others have commented, while we felt comfortable staying in Shelby’s home, it was a little awkward being there with all of her personal belongings in the house.
We made Shelby aware of a few issues with ceiling fixtures, but were able to work around them.
Sadly, we never were able to unlock the back door so we could enjoy the patio and yard. The afternoon prior to our departure, a friend of Shelby’s came by to help with the ceiling fixtures and explained that Shelby has been waiting for a replacement back door and we could have accessed the backyard by going through the garage and utility room.
The location was excellent and provided easy access to all of the events we attended in Plainview.
Overall, we enjoyed our stay."

This was the first time we have stayed somewhere where it was obvious someone lived there regularly, so I felt a bit odd feeling like I was in someone else's space, especially when cooking in the kitchen. I felt a bit like I was snooping as I opened cupboards to locate items needed to make a meal. That is all on me, not Shelby or the place. It was clean and comfortable. Loved the backyard, although the neighborhood kids weren't all that friendly as they threw sticks at my grandkids. Again, not Shelby or the houses fault. I would still recommend her place if your coming through Plainview."

Stayed a few nights","We booked Shelby’s house in order to visit with our great friend in Plainview and it was wonderful to be able to host him there for TV watching, visiting and eating. This is the first airbnb house we’ve been in where ALL of the owners’ things are still in the house, so we were surprised but after figuring out how to plug in our chargers for phones and computers, we were very comfortable and enjoyed her knickknacks and pictures along the wall. It made it very homey. There were three recliners in the living room which made it even more comfortable. And she left so many things in the kitchen to use!—she said help yourself – although I hesitated to, I did use some of the spices. She has a Keurig coffee machine and said to use the coffee pods, but I didn’t like to use up her “expensive” coffee, so I just set up our own regular coffee pot that we had in our van, as we use a lot of coffee. Checking in was easy, she stopped by one day to check on the air conditioner (and actually knew our friend so that was great!), the back porch (pictured) was so nice to sit on, the internet was fast and the cable TV was great and we slept well. There is a carport and also lots of parking along the street. It was easy to stay here and I recommend it for anyone who likes comfort!"

Stayed with kids",This was a cozy 2 bedroom / 1 bathroom house on a busy street. It was easy to communicate with Shelby. Check-in and -out was seemless. This was a better option for our family than staying in a hotel.

Group trip","We loved our stay here during our recent visit to Lubbock.
Home was comfortable and met all our needs. Unable to enjoy the backyard, which was beautiful, due to rain. The kids did enjoy the brick path and were calling it the ""yellow brick road.""
Shelby was easy to communicate with prior and during our stay.
We would definitely recommend this home if we ever need to travel this way again.
Great little house~great home"

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed our stay at Shelby's place. I think it could have been a little more renter-ready, there was a lot of dust and lots of light bulbs out. The bed was also uncomfortably soft and hard on the back. But Shelby was very helpful and accommodating and I'd take her house over a hotel room any day."

Stayed a few nights","Private house in a residential neighborhood located about an hour from Palo Duro Canyon. Grocery stores and restaurants located within a couple of miles. The beds were comfortable, the kitchen was fully equipped, the bathroom was a bit small and didn't have a lock, but was fine. The backyard was great - nice and spacious, fully fenced in, with a nice back porch for drinking your morning coffee. Shelby was a very responsive and helpful host. Great experience overall!"
