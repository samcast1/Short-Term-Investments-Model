I really appreciated the little plug-in fireplace in the bedroom and the beds/pillows were comfy. There's a good bit of traffic noise from the main road, so if you're sensitive, earplugs would come in handy. Harmony was very accommodating, especially when we accidentally left something behind! A lovely Victorian stay...we'll hopefully be back!"

Stayed a few nights","Fun little stay, the wood floors in the apartment are not something you see very often.
3 beds made it very spacious. Host provided charging cords for your phones/tablets which I found thoughtful.
Don’t let the word “apartment” fool you, the space is just that. spacious.
Host was great at communicating and had even sent a message warning us of the holiday parade downtown in case we had plans in the area. Instructions to open the door were clear. I may have missed it, but wasn’t sure where to park. Under the carport seemed the right thing, didn’t hear otherwise.
The only one concerned anyone should have, the shower is tiny. If you’re a larger person, just know it’s small..
Great place, great price. Book it."

We were in the area to see our daughter in a musical at the Ohio Star Theatre. It was an easy commute. We were also celebrating Thanksgiving with her and her boyfriend. It was wonderful to have the space to do Thanksgiving dinner. I recommend Harmony’s place you will love it.

Stayed one night","This large downstairs apartment in a grand old house was really great. Perfect for our stay. The kitchen had everything we needed and it's a full sized, not just an afterthought kitchenette. The apartment has high ceilings with fans that had been reversed for winter - that helps bring the heat back down. I imagine they are great in the summer, as well. There are some beautiful wood floors with interesting architectural details. The beds were comfortable with various pillow options and there are also some thoughtful touches like a motion activated nightlight near the bathroom, universal charging cables by each bed, and blackout curtains on all the bedroom windows. The covered parking was really appreciated for loading and unloading, since it was raining when we arrived and when we left. If you come to town to catch a show at the Performing Arts Center, like we did, this is a great place to stay. Don't miss the Ernest Warther Musuem in nearby Dover, either."

Stayed with kids","The location was great and everything was smooth. There were plenty of amenities, most importantly wifi and the TV options were great. Beds were comfortable and I felt the temp was perfect.
One thing I will say for people with small kids - the apartment is definitely not sound proof so make sure you bring a sound machine if your kids are sensitive to sounds - we could hear the upstairs neighbors late and early and I can only assume they heard us.
Overall we had a very great stay!"

Lots of personal touches, including tea and coffee in the kitchen, games in the parlor, charging cords for all types of phones and devices, and (our favorite) the massage chair.

Close to everything in New Philly- great restaurants close- the home itself was very cozy!! Great kitchen supplies! Well stocked with everything! The hosts provided our favorite breakfast items. Roku TV with DVD, games and large dining room. Nice well stocked bathrooms- fluffy huge towels, nice showers and tub.

Beds were very comfortable for me, I have slept in many motels not nearly as nice and far more expensive. As long as you are ok with vintage 1920 era homes you shouldn’t pass this up. Close by everything 30 minutes to amish country. 1.5 hours to cleavland, and very reasonably priced. Thanks again Steve ,

The house had everything we needed, kitchen was well stocked, soap for bathrooms, towels, games, tvs. House was very spacious, rooms were big. Beds were comfortable. We loved that we could bring our small dog and they provided doggie treats! Breakfast was a nice touch. Would recommend this place and happy to stay here again! Thank you!"

We found the location to perfectly suit our needs. The living room had lots of comfy furniture and ample space, and the dining room was great for meals and board games.
The bedrooms were very comfortable—great mattresses, pillows and bedding.
The bathrooms were well-stocked and the towels were fabulous.
The kitchen was bright and clean, and provided everything we needed for meal prep. It was also really nice that breakfast supplies were provided.
This historic home has so much charm and character, with all of the modern conveniences.
New Philadelphia is a cute town—we enjoyed walking the neighborhood and taking in the architecture, and shopping downtown.
I would definitely stay here again!"

The extra bathroom off of the kitchen was a great addition and served our family well. This home is in a residential location, but just an easy 14-minute walk to the downtown area which is rich in restaurants, shops, and things to do. Thank you for a great experience and a wonderful stay! We recommend this home to anyone thinking of staying in the New Philadelphia area."

We had mentioned the wedding started earlier than check in and they kindly offered us a early check in. We were pleasantly surprised and took advantage of the offer!

Stayed a few nights","Absolutely beautiful place w/ many interesting & eclectic furnishings and decorations. As others have pointed out, the attention to detail was second to none...coffee, beverages, creamers, etc. There is a patio & steps-away pond with a fire pit & logs if you have time for it. Unfortunately I didn't, but it would be great to sit out there w/ a beverage and enjoy the country setting.
There were a couple of small problems I experienced...1) a weak electrical breaker that killed the unit's power once, 2) the associated lack of hot water, and 3) dishes that were not ultimately microwave safe. But Tony was fast to respond and the overwhelmingly 5-star aspect of the location, furnishings and peace & serenity of the place made it the nicest & best value AirBNB I have experienced to date.
Bottom-line: do not hesitate to book this place and you will be very satisfied I am sure.
BTW: about 6 to 8 miles from New Philadelphia, but it's a simple drive there.
Thanks Tony & LouAnn!"

Stayed one night","This is an amazing place! I can honestly say it was one of the nicest places I've ever stayed - cozy, very peaceful, and CLEAN (even for a crazy germophobe like me). We stayed one night after biking along the southern portion of the towpath trail, and it was a great location for this. I've had all good experiences staying in homes when the owner is present, but each time I do feel a little anxious about whether or not I'll feel uncomfortable or ""in their way."" However, I immediately felt good about my choice when we arrived: Tony and Louanne were both so genuine when they welcomed us, but they'll also give you total privacy if you want it. I admit I laughed at how many reviewers mentioned the bathroom, but it really does deserve all the praise it gets - it's so gorgeous! The whole space was beautiful. The private patio overlooking the pond was a great way to wind down at the end of the day, and again for having our coffee (provided by the owners) the next morning. I hope to return to the New Philadelphia area - we'd definitely stay at Casini's again!"

During the night, we went outside and sat on the bench swing as we drank the delicious red wine Louanne gave us and watched a gorgeous fireflies light up the yard. My boyfriend had never seen fireflies before, it was truly magical. It was so cozy and beautiful, we didn't want to leave! The Airbnb was so cozy with personal touches. The bathroom was gorgeous with a walk in shower and romantic lighting. The bedroom was beautifully decorated with the most comfortable bed! This is the perfect place if you're attending a wedding at one of the many nearby venues or even a honeymoon spot. I hope someone else in my family gets married nearby so I can stay there again. ❤️"

Stayed one night","Quiet comfortable unit in a large beautiful home, country setting, extra nice amenities. Great coffee and snacks provided, everything you need for a relaxing stay. Spacious rooms, fireplaces, well stocked coffee station and mini kitchen. Large bathroom and nice shower. Great private patio with comfortable chairs. Good communication. Only negative for us was the access to the unit. To enter you need to walk around the garage, and across the owners patio, then up a couple stairs to their deck, then a few steps over to another couple stairs to go down to the lawn. From there a short walk down a grassy slope and over to the private patio. It was raining when we went dinner, and we found the wet grass and sloping landscape tricky to navigate. Be aware of this- we are in our 70’s and we did were able to do it with luggage, etc, but it requires caution."

Stayed one night","My daughter and I spent one night at Casini's Corner, and I am sad we were not able to stay longer. Since the area had just experienced snow and ice, Louanne and Tony had to have spent countless hours cleaning and treating surfaces so that we had a clear place to park and a pathway to the entrance. There are so many thoughtful touches such as this that we noticed immediately upon arrival. Louanne and Tony were there to greet us and to make sure we could get in, which was lovely since we arrived after the sun went down and it was dark. Stepping inside, we immediately noticed that the area was tastefully decorated, warm and inviting. There was soft lighting throughout, the TV was showing a beautiful winter scene and there were two hot chocolate bombs and farm fresh milk in the mini fridge. The hosts have a gift for decorating and making guests feel warm and welcome. We noticed an abundance of fluffy pillows and blankets, two electric fireplaces for ambiance and added warmth, an enormous bathroom with plenty of fluffy towels, extra sheets and pillows, and winter country decor adorning may surfaces. We both spent time relaxing and finishing up some reading before turning in for the night. We had to get up for an early start the next day, so the selection of coffee and tea to start the day off right was perfect.
It is worth mentioning that we felt very safe, which is important to note since we were two females traveling alone. I would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone, even single travelers.
Louanne offered to share their dinner with us; they had made pizza and had extra. A very sweet offer, but we had just eaten before leaving home and I knew we both had reading we had to finish. I do believe the hosts would be open to connecting with guests, if you are interested and able, but also will leave you to be if you have a full schedule or perhaps just prefer to not socialize.
I hope to be back someday with my husband. I would love to spend some time there in the warmer months when we can enjoy the beautiful back yard, patio and pond. And perhaps we can get to know the hosts a bit :)"

Stayed a few nights",Casini's Corner is such a gem! Louanne and Tony are very responsive hosts and communication was great prior to and during our stay. They have taken such care in creating a warm and inviting space for their guests. My husband and I were in Ohio to visit the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton for his birthday and just enjoy a relaxing time afterwards. We found this space to be perfect for our needs. Everything is just as pictured..and more! It was beautifully decorated for Christmas at the time of our stay and there were so many cozy and thoughtful touches throughout. We enjoy being off the beaten path a bit so it was well worth the drive over from Canton for us and we found everything we needed within a 15min drive to town. Our time spent at Casini's Corner became the highlight of our trip and we feel very blessed to have been their guests!

Stayed with kids","I was scheduled to arrive early morning while still dark out! Micheal & Jennifer left the lights on for my family. I have a 10 months old who is independent and crawls everywhere! I was so worried about getting an Airbnb because of her. But Michael & Jennifer’s place was spotless! We are a family of 5! It was so spacious! There were games, a large TV, comfortable beds, waters, coffee, dishes, and snacks (one being popcorn, my 5yos fav) literally a moms dream! My favorite thing was the openness of the space! My 5yo and 3yo sons ran around and played with everything as my 10m old daughter followed behind lol and it’s so kid friendly there was nothing for them to get hurt on or break! So I was able to sit on the couch and relax and always see them! Loved it! It’s also so Private! I never had to worry about them keeping it down! After the kids were asleep me and my husband played fact or crap that the host provided in the comfort in our own room! It felt like home! 10/10!"

There were a lot of storms the day we arrived so we was quick at entering and leaving and did not get to meet the hosts in person. Overall it was a great cozy, quiet, and peaceful place to rest for a busy weekend of events."

Their home is beautiful and comfortable. I slept like a baby! They provide quite a number of little luxuries that make their guests feel special. I stayed four nights and wished my schedule would allow me to stay longer. I look forward to a return visit.

Stayed about a week","The place was very spacious, exceptionally clean, nice location. It was great having the grab and go breakfast items and bottled water. The television service is a smartTV with streaming capabilities so be sure to bring your passwords for the additional channels you may be desiring. The internet service was fast and adequate.
There is a small dog on the premises but it barely barked and was contained to the back yard and owners space. The entrance is through a side door in their garage and then down a flight of steps and although it isn't considered a private entrance it is very close as it is separate from the owner area. I would certainly recommend this location to family or friends."

By the time I left I almost felt like family.
I could write on and on about them if you are traveling to the Dover area and they have availability this is the place you want to stay do not look any further.
Thank you Jennifer and Michael for your warm welcome and making me feel so comfortable and secure in your home you are both wonderful people and I will absolutely contact you if and when I return to this area."

The place was very clean, pleasant, and inviting; it is being located in a very quiet and nice community just 3 minutes away from the Harley Davidson dealer and less than 30 minutes away from the heart of Amish country, Berlin, OH. The host provided map and information of all of the Amish town’s interesting places for us to use. The host was extremely cordial and made us feel at home. This Airbnb is a bargain for the price.

There was a nice grill for us to cook steaks on as well.
Really nice shower and bathtub…. Beware water comes from the ceiling for the tub scared my wife ha ha.

The beds are comfy (although some of our party found them a little too firm) but wonderful comforter. New appliances, comfortable and stylish recliners in the living room, and enough seating for everyone there and in the dining room.Tiffany responded quickly on one question we had about the heating system and checked in with us during the week. We will definitely stay here again on a future visit."

Stayed with kids","Tiffany was an amazing host!!! The house was in beautiful condition, exactly like the photos (but better). So many thoughtfully provided items in to house too:
Bedrooms are park themed with all the local landmarks on display.
We got to watch the fireworks from the house and the kids really loved how close we were to the park and pool.
Tiffany provided plenty of towels, dishes/glasses/utensils, pillows, and throws!
There are side tables with lamps that have usb outlets everywhere you need them so you don’t have to go behind furniture to just to charge your phone.
The provided grill on the deck out back was such an awesome perk for us to celebrate my mom’s birthday.
And so much more!
Just book it. It’s amazing and will be perfect."

Stayed with kids","If you are staying in the area then this is the place you need to stay. Randy and Tammy were amazing hosts. We were staying here for a wedding that was hosted at a venue just 5 minutes away. This was extremely helpful considering we have two young children so it made it much easier for us to get the family to and from the wedding. Tammy was very proactive when communicating this us throughout our stay. Their place was extremely clean and we felt right at home when we came in. They even provided a pack n play for our 8 month old daughter. They left food out so that our 2.5 year old can feed their chickens, which we absolutely loved. I took advantage of our coffee bar both mornings and enjoyed sipping coffee each morning as the sun rose over the hills."

Stayed with kids","This is a wonderful house. We had an absolutely delightful stay. The rooms are clean and tidy, and exuding a cozy ambiance that truly made us feel at home.
Although the house is next to the road, it is very quiet and there is beautiful hill around and you can see beautiful sunset. I also like the sunlight in the morning.
Randy and Tammy are excellent hosts, displaying genuine kindness and attentiveness. They just live next door. We have a very happy chat, which added an extra layer of warmth to our experience.
One of the highlights of our stay was definitely interacting with their adorable chicks - both our 2.5 yr old daughter and we loved it! The joy of feeding the chickens became a wonderful memory our time there.
Oh, Randy and Tammy also generously share with us the delicious fresh eggs! The eggs come straight from their chickens and are absolute delicious.
All in all, our stay at Randy and Tammy's house was wonderful."

Tammy & Randy thought of everything in providing such a beautiful property and home. We lacked nothing.
Beds were so super comfortable that everyone had the best sleep ever.
Really enjoyed the two spacious yet cozy living rooms and the front porch was lovely.
Unfortunately the weather didn't cooperate for us to use the other two porches, grill or fire pit. Next time!!
Some of our favorite moments were meeting Tammy & Randy and hearing about the history of the house, watching the chickens, seeing the horses across the road, relaxing with friends, playing games, enjoying the peace and quiet and warming ourselves by the fireplace.
Loved the country atmosphere and being so close to everything Amish country has to offer.
Our favorite sights were seeing the World's Largest Cuckoo Clock and all of the animals at the Farm at Walnut Creek.
We decided before we even left when our return trip will be.
Hope to see the best hosts in February."

We were excited to see the place based on the pictures but the reality far exceeded the pictures. It was impeccable and full of thoughtful design details. I can't recommend it enough. If you're looking for some peace and quiet surrounded by birdsong and a beautiful lake view - book this or any of the other A-Frames at Paradise Lake.

Stayed a few nights","The word to describe this property is exceptional. We are two seniors staying for a weekend; we cook all of our own meals. The home was as described; it was clean with ample supplies/ equipment. The kitchen had an abundance of dishes/utensils/appliances that were in good working condition. It was QUIET. There were no sounds from farm machinery, cars, animals, or people. It was relaxing just to look out the windows at the hills and trees. The home had good safety features including handrails on stairs; walk-in shower with built-in seat, night lights, door locks. The beds and furniture were high quality and in excellent condition.
We enjoyed petting and feeding the animals with the provided treats but they could easily be ignored if one is interested in this activity.
Carol has thought of all the little things that make a home comfortable e.g. drinks in the frig, extra linens, night lights, and even flip flops for the Jacuzzi. Thank you Carol for making our stay memorable."

Stayed with kids","As a family of 5 we have stayed in many Airbnb and rentals around Ohio, Kentucky and Michigan. This was by far the cleanest and most well laid out for our family. It’s a lovely little peaceful setting for relaxing. There is working farm out window a couple fields over but nothing that will disturb you (except for the occasional loud cow moo!) There are sheep and donkeys just behind the house to pet/ feed. There are generous yard and porch / patio areas around the house as pictured (all clean and inviting) . Although this is rural farm with great views it’s one of the first just out of town so it’s 5 minutes to convenience stores / grocery. The host is very accommodating (we had last minute possible changes) and responsive. She left special and thoughtful treats and advice for us. The well stocked coffee station was a real bonus!"

Carol is a wonderful host who went out of her way to make us feel comfortable and welcome. She gave us a tour of the farm and told us all about the history of the area.
It is a working farm, but everyone gave us privacy. The hot tub was a wonderful evening ritual we had during our stay. And the goats and donkeys came out each night to join (watch) us!

We even got to see some farm work with the cows our last day! The market they own is a 5 minute walk down the driveway and we got our dinner supplies for both nights we stayed. Cannot say enough good things about the produce and meat! We met the owners and they were so so friendly and informative. We felt right at home and never wanted to leave! Lastly, although the hot tub was not working, we had a fire pit so we still got to enjoy the outdoors. Stores/restaurants are super close. You had EVERYTHING you could need in the kitchen.

We are picky folks and wouldn’t change a thing and can’t wait to come back."

Porch overlooking local farm and woods,perfect place to watch the sunset. Our party of 7 had ample room for the christmas holiday. Kitchen had everything we needed and more for a proper Christmas dinner. The game room was a hit with our teenagers and toddler staying with us. Home was so warm and cozy it felt like staying at a relatives house for the holiday. It was just perfect. This maybe a christmas tradition now!"

Kitchen came stocked with all the amenities we would need (hand mixer was broken and didn’t turn on but that’s okay) and the WiFi was speedy.
Hot tub was clean and bathrooms were spotless.
The upstairs bathroom does not have a shower so the downstairs bathroom had to be shared.
Plenty of towels and the heat and electric fireplace worked great!
Would definitely stay again!"

Group trip","I would stay here again. We had a couples weekend (3 couples). We were able to go out and have adventures in Amish country and come back to the cabin in the evening and enjoy all the amazing amenities and views! Super close to 2 of our favorite wineries (8 min drive). There was an oscillating fan on premise, which sounds like a silly thing to mention, but it was a nice thing to have on site. The garage was a great feature, too. Having the garage doors open while being able to have a tv, couch, ping pong, etc. was really enjoyable. You were able to have indoor amenities while enjoying the outdoors at the same time. 3 Smart TVs there were easy to sign into your favorite streaming apps. Wifi was top-notch. Everything was super clean, smelled nice, decorated tastefully, and was very organized. Oh, and there is an ice maker and water on the fridge, another bonus."

Def would stay again just for fun some other weekend. Lindsay was super attentive and quick to respond when we had questions! If I had one singular complaint it would just be that the shower was very slippery 😂 other than that, it was such an awesome stay with a gorgeous view."

There is a farm across the street and the animals start making noises around 6:30am. There was also large a bird feeder about 15 feet from the hot tub. Both nights around 9:30pm 8-10 raccoons would show up to eat the seed. If that issue is corrected, the outside space would be even better."

We were so close to Amish/Swiss country with Berlin/Walnut Creek/Sugarcreek in close driving distance so the shopping and enjoyment was great which we planned on but we were just as close to the public with New Philadelphia/Dover area for the essentials for shopping like Walmart and Giant Eagle. It was a great combination of being secluded yet still being everywhere distance wise where we wanted to be. Our host Lindsay was so responsive to all our are questions as it was the first time we had visited this area. She gave us great recommendations on which places to eat/shop at in all the areas close by and provided simple, detailed instructions on how to access/maintain the property. The kids loved the game room with the ping pong and foosball tables. The biggest treat was seeing my city kids and wife’s reactions watching the deer crossing the property from the hot tub. They were so close to us and didn’t mind!"

Stayed with kids","Really beautiful property…great amenities! A wonderful place for a family getaway. We spent a long weekend there with my husband, girls, and parents. We all really enjoyed the game room (stayed up way late playing ping pong and darts!) and the hot tub. The layout of the house was ideal for our situation. The upstairs opens up to a loft that is set up as a little play area, there are too connected bedrooms and half bath up there. It worked well for my husband and girls to have the upstairs area and my parents stayed in the downstairs bedroom. The kitchen is stocked well with all you need to make home cooked meals. The house is very close to Sugarcreek, and a little farther from the heart of Amish country, but only 20 or so minutes. If we go back with my parents, we’d definitely stay there again!"

Stayed a few nights","We all had an excellent time. It’s a new and very well maintained property. The beds were super comfortable. The house as a whole is made with quality materials and the rooms are quiet. There’s a garage with ping pong tables, dartboard, and fooseball. We had a baby and it was really kid friendly with toys and other kid items. The hot tub was so relaxing. The home is within minutes of anything you need or would like to do. We took a walk out the lane and never met a car. We made smores on the fire pit. We just really had a relaxing time in Lindsay's home.
We loved it and would absolutely come again.

Stayed with kids","This was the most well stocked vacation home we’ve ever been to! There was plenty of bedding, blankets, kitchen supplies and stuff to do to keep our clan of 6 adults and 6 kids aged 4-14 happily occupied. The pool and fire pit and hot tub were wonderful for the days it wasn’t raining and there was still plenty to do inside when it was raining. It’s in a pretty rural area so a bit of a drive to buy groceries but we came well prepared and used the grill and well stocked kitchen for our stay. The house is definitely on a hill so no great opportunities for evening strolls but it was great for keeping the kids close and safe even after dark. It was a fantastic place for our family reunion and plenty of space to spread out and even plenty of quiet nooks away from the chaos for those that needed some downtime. While there is a first floor bathroom and full bath, the entrances into the house all have a couple steps so it’s not fully accessible."

We loved the total rural setting while being close to grocery stores, restaurants, etc. The house is HUGE! So much so that for the first two days we kept getting lost. The backyard was AWESOME and afforded everyone the chance to be outside without always being on top of one another. We took a few quick side trips to The Wilds, the Football Hall of Fame, and discovered the Warther Museum in Dover and its hand carved trains, and we also enjoyed walking on some of the local trails. I would definitely recommend this place if you love the comforts of home and nature at its best."

We enjoyed the pool the most during 90° plus weather. There are lots of steps just in case someone in your party has trouble walking. This was not an issue for us. There are so many fun activities to keep everyone entertained, lovely country views, and plenty of privacy. The hosts were absolutely wonderful and made certain that everything was up to par.

The house was just PERFECT for our group of 6 ladies having a girl's getaway weekend! We can't wait to plan another getaway here! The hosts were exceptionally attentive and easy to work with! I can't say enough good things about this entire Airbnb Home experience!

The instructions for check-in, stay, and check-out were detailed and very helpful. The house was very clean and well stocked. We could not have asked for a better place to enjoy our family get together. Overall a lovely place and great value for money that we would recommend to anyone."

Stayed a few nights","When country charm meets city convenience, Liberty Hill Lodge offers a cozy and welcoming fall retreat with amazing and private views out every single window. Relax in the peaceful surroundings while still only a 5 min drive from Starbucks or New Philadelphia's Daily Grind Cafe (the tomato bisque is locally famous). Flooded with sunlight and a room fit for every need, Liberty Hill will quickly become your happy place for family, friends, and gatherings large and small. Lori has thought of every last detail, creating not only the most user-friendly space but leaving you needing nothing more. Liberty Hill will be our new go-to spot when visiting friends and family in the area, with amenities perfect for all seasons."

Group trip","We booked Liberty Hill Lodge for my 22nd Birthday getaway. There were 11 of us and the space accommodated our sleeping needs perfectly! The house itself far surpassed our expectations, when we first arrived it was almost as if we were going through a maze. We loved that so much stuff was provided from any kitchen essential to shampoo and conditioner, it made our lives so much easier. The hot tub was the hit of the weekend by far. It would reach down to 35 degrees at night and the hot tub was the best place to hangout. It was also very easy to maintain and prepare (with the great instructions from the hosts) The game room was a sight to see and we loved having our own pool table. The dining room table was perfect for our big group (we cooked two huge meals) and the house was big enough to where we could all be together or have our own personal space. I stayed in the master bedroom and it was the most incredible experience. When I tell you every single person came to my room to shower I am not exaggerating! The views from the tall windows were stunning and the sky at night was something out of a movie. The driveway was a bit steep but nothing unmanageable. The boys loved the basketball court in the driveway. The location gave us quick access to so many things, grocery stores, gas, activities etc. The communication with the host was insanely quick and so helpful. If there was one thing to complain about it would be that our stay wasn’t long enough! Throughout the whole weekend we kept saying that we can’t wait to come back. Giving this place 5 stars would be an understatement. Liberty Hill is a must stay and our group plans to make several trips to come back again!"

There are many areas to sit and relax or entertain a group of people. My kids played hide and seek and had a hard time finding everyone because of how many rooms there were! There was so much room to spread out, relax and enjoy the amazing views of the house. Decorations were great, with rooms having different travel themes. We loved every minute and will be back."

Stayed a few nights","Liberty Hill lodge is a beautiful place to stay. I was celebrating with my siblings and mother. I am cancer free for one year. They helped take care of me and I wanted to treat them with a few days of rest and relaxation! We picked the perfect place. They had flowers waiting for me with a sweet note.
The kitchen is well-equipped for cooking, however we ate out every night at local restaurants. They’re very close.
We spent most of our time in the comfy bonus room. Played games and just vegged out.
We found out the first night that the hot tub power jets were not working….however….they jumped right on it and it was fixed next day. The communication was great!!!
It is a great place for family get togethers. Comfortable, clean and roomy.
I highly recommend Lori and Liberty Hill."

Far enough out of town to be peaceful, but close enough to town if you needed anything. We enjoyed going to Hoodletown brewery and Huffy's for lunch and a drink, but we spent most of our time by the pool and enjoyed every inch of the outdoor space! Great hosts!"

During the evening we sat by the fire and ate too many s’mores. I have children that range in age from 1-15 yrs old and everyone had activities to enjoy while we’re there. Lori has everything you could want or need already there for you, from games and toys too cooking supplies. We only needed to pack our clothes and bring food with us. We always all look forward to going back again and you will too!"

We had normal Ohio cold April weather and it was still amazing! The hot tub was a great bonus. The Rec room provided tons of fun for the kids. And the 3 car garage provided a great place for the kids to skate, ride bikes, and hangout when it was raining. TONS of space to spread out. We never felt like we were on top of one another. And the crib and bed rail were added bonuses that really helped our young children feel at home. We hope to come back again in the future as this house was perfect for us!"

You have an absolutely beautiful home and property and we will definitely be booking another stay in the future, it’s the perfect place for a “staycation”. The hot tub is amazing and the pool was heated warm enough to enjoy on a 55 degree April day. Best of all is the home is big enough to space out and not feel crowded even with 6 children and 6 adults"

Owners, Lori and Jonna are very friendly and extremely prompt with response to any questions. Their beautiful home on the hill is spacious, pristine, a great layout, and beautifully decorated. Our family members were thrilled with the accommodations! Beyond the four comfortable bedrooms (with amazing views) are the additional living spaces designed with everyone in mind; spacious living rooms, sunroom, even an upper rec room complete with foosball, pool table and large screen tv. The outdoor space is equally amazing with patio, grill and fire pit that we all enjoyed. (I can only imagine how awesome it becomes in the warmer months when the in-ground pool is unveiled!) Highly recommend Liberty Hill Lodge for the perfect group getaway. We had a wonderful stay, hope to visit again!!"
