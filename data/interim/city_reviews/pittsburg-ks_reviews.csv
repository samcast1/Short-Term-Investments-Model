Her place is within walking distance of several parks, shops, and good food options. And the space itself is just like the pictures: clean, comfortable, and full of character."

Terri gave some of the clearest instructions for how to find place and how to get in. The apartment itself was even better than pictured. Absolutely gorgeous and can tell a lot of love has been put into it. If any future trips to Pittsburg I will definitely be looking for availability here before any hotel

Stayed a few nights","Loved the location but as a plus sized person, this spot was a little tight for me. Especially the toilet situation. Figured it out but it was a fun time.
Only had A/C in the bedroom and a small one in the living room. The bathroom and kitchen got fairly warm to get ready in.
Bed was very comfortable. Wish there was blackout curtains or shades to sleep in a bit.
Loved the mirror in the bathroom that had different lighting settings.
Overall, it did what it needed to do!"

Stayed with a pet","We loved our stay in this apartment, it was so cute and comfortable. There are several places close by to eat and shop. The apartment is so very unique and homey feeling! There are plants and books, and the decor keeps you looking. We did not really cook while we were there, but everything was available for us to do so. There were plenty of linens, blankets, toiletries, and even a small washer and dryer. It is on the main street so you will hear some traffic, but the neighbors were very quiet. We were also able to bring our little dog. There are patches of grass to take your pet to get some exercise also. The best place we found is a block away, at Memorial Auditorium. There is grass and a picnic table and they even provide waste bags for your pet. Terri sent us a picture that made it easy to identify the apartment entrance. We received a code to get into the building, then a key to the apartment. We would definitely recommend this to anyone staying in Pittsburg!"

A few things we really liked is that mirror in the bathroom & the bohemian eclectic decor, as one guest before us wrote, in the guest book Terri & her husband provided. 😄 The bed was extremely comfortable too! Also the mirrors were perfect for us to get ready for my son’s wedding. Thanks so much for your advice on where to go. We spent a fortune at The Blue Spoon 😋😋😋 Highly recommend checking their place out."

Stayed a few nights","Great, central location in Pittsburg, and a way better value than an over-priced hotel room. There are coffee shops and restaurants within walking distance, as well as a paved walking/biking trail that runs diagonally through the town. The décor is really interesting the place was comfortable. We were a little wary when we entered the building and headed up the stairs because it smelled really musty, but inside the apartment, it was fine. I have a strong sense of smell and don't like air fresheners, so I unplugged the one that was there and was afraid we'd smell the musty thing, but we did not. We enjoyed our stay."

Stayed a few nights","The apartment was small and quaint. It was set up so cute and the decor was original and interesting to admire. Perfect for our little getaway. The apartment is perfect size for 2 and very spacious. We utilized the kitchen with cooking and baking. The shower had great hot water and pressure. The bed is memory foam and is comfy as well. The tv is a roku connection so streaming was super easy.
The area is on a business district with a pool bar across the street. It does get noisy when the bar closes. There are many older down store fronts along both sides of the street that are great for window shopping. Walmart is literally right down the road.
Terri is amazing in communication and details.
We visited Mazzios Pizza (YUMMY), walmart, and the casino."

Stayed a few nights","This was seamless for me. I booked a last minute trip to Pittsburg to be near my sisters family for my nieces birthday. The hotels near her when over priced for the weekend. The price was great for the accommodations. She gave clear instructions on where to locate the door (it was in downtown and would have been hard to find) she sent pictures of the adjoining store and the door. Let me tell you, as a single woman traveling alone and getting in at 10pm in a strange city/state, this was so appreciated. I wasn’t searching around and messaging her trying to locate it. It was so cute and industrial. I am super cautious when staying in airbnbs alone because of the weird things that could happen, i checked all the closets and doors. The door in the living was sticking so I thought it was locked, and it kind of worried me. At 10:30pm ish, i sent her a picture of the door to ask what was behind it for my own peace of mind (too many horror movies) and she was so quick to respond. I recommend!"

You can either spend your time reading reviews or lock in a great experience now! Ruthie delivered on everything she said. A very beautiful home in a quiet area. Some say they hear cars, but I couldn't. They went top line with everything. Endless hot water, clean linens, dish washer, lights all over, games, TV streaming, easy communication and check in/out process, and so much more. GREAT PRICING!! This was my first Airbnb experience and because of them, I'm hooked! They set the bar extremely high in standards. Such a delightful stay. So, enjoy a wonderful place. 10/10 I'll do it again!"

If visiting in warmer weather, you will have an even better time because the game room/garage would be more comfortable. And let's talk about the bikes provided! How fun!

Stayed one night","My teenage son and I really liked staying at Darrell and Kitty's Cozy Cottage. It was truthfully the cleanest house I have ever seen.
It had everything we needed: Two bedrooms, extremely comfortable beds, laundry room with ironing board and iron, and well-equipped kitchen. The bathroom towels were super soft, the living room was comfortable and provided a nice space to relax, and we could park our car in the garage.
The neighborhood felt safe and was close to a grocery store (Dillons) and drug store (Walgreens) and there were restaurants nearby.
We would be very pleased to stay here again someday."

Stayed with a pet","They were very friendly and accommodating. It was snowing and cold so pipes were frozen but they worked hard and the place was warm and cozy and in order when we checked in. They allowed my dog to come with me and everything was perfect. It was Christmas and the house was decorated with Christmas decorations. I had my Grandchildren come and stay with me during the trip and we had a great time. I want to thank them for a wonderful stay and if I come to visit again, I would like to stay there."

Stayed with kids","Marie & Curt’s place was absolutely perfect for us! Everything was as described in the listing & the place was very clean. The kitchen had more available than I typically see in most rentals, including kids plates! When we arrived it was dark outside but the security light on the house allowed us to easily see even in unfamiliar settings. Soft ambient lighting and holiday scents greeted us in the house which felt so comforting, especially after a long drive with a little one. Linens on the bed were super soft & the towels in the bathroom were as well. We brought our pack & play for the little one which can sometimes be tricky to find a quite dark place for but it actually fit in the closet nook with curtains to help block light. Marie & Curt were very quick to respond if we had any questions & even provided us with fresh eggs! We were so appreciative to have this place to stay while visiting family for a few day. We will certainly be staying here again when we travel back!"

The only complaint is that the bed was very, very uncomfortable. There is no firmness; you basically just sink into it. We did not get a good night sleep because of this. This is a major downside, but is our only complaint.
Also, if you get a chance to catch a Pitt volleyball game, do it! They are a lot of fun!"

Very peaceful, please note I was there during the summer so I don't know if that changes during the school year. I plan on staying there instead of a hotel anytime I'm in town for a conference or class."

Definitely, great bars and restaurants to try. Very comfortable and clean home.
Would recommend to other solo or couple travelers! Thank you for having me Coltyn."

Stayed a few nights","Coltyn is very responsive and helpful with communication, and his place is top notch. Super clean, nicely decorated, great layout and plenty of space for two, comfy bed, easy parking, quiet surroundings—It was just right for our long weekend visit. If there was a “They thought of everything” award, he would take the Gold. Qtips and cotton balls in the bathroom, a nice selection of healthy snacks (even fresh fruit!), conveniences like a lint roller and scissors…Those are things that make it feel homey and welcoming. It was winter when we stayed, but the grill and porch furniture would be nice in warmer weather. The porch lights are a nice touch too. There was a comment about the lot and the neighborhood. If you’re used to urban or suburban living with buildings all in a row, this location might feel different. It’s just smaller town Midwest. It was quiet, safe, and conveniently located. We loved our stay and will be back if we ever return to Pittsburg!"

The place was nicely furnished and water and snacks were provided. We loved that there were games too! We always spend eat least one night eating pizza and playing games, so it was nice to not have to go out and buy games lol!
The morning of check-in the host messaged us with instructions and even said we could check-in early if we wanted to. It was a long drive so the ability to check in early was great (even though we didn't make it early).
The area seemed a little rough, but there were cameras and we felt secure. Overall we enjoyed our stay and would stay again :)."

I was also very thankful that this Airbnb was modernized with amazing internet access/wifi so I could get some much-needed work done during our stay. After putting in a few hours of work we were so conveniently located that we could pop out to any place and catch a quick bite to eat or enjoy a fun evening on the town. After all the busyness, it was wonderful to come back and unwind and relax and get comfy at this Airbnb! It felt so cozy and just like home!

Only issue was that the stove stopped working on the first night right at dinnertime when we were about to make pasta. However, Curt came over and fixed it and was done by 9pm, which we appreciated.
Additionally, I was pleasantly surprised when the host offered to reimburse us for our pizza dinner on the night the stove malfunctioned. That was a nice gesture.
In conclusion, I would recommend this Airbnb to others looking for a great place to stay. Despite the inconvenience with the stove, this is a good spot if you're looking for a relaxing weekend in Girard."

Group trip","Our stay here was perfect. The beds were king size in both bedrooms. It was nice having an on-suite bathroom with the master bedroom. The house was cozy and adorable. We were just there for the night and found ourselves wishing we had more time and maybe stayed at least another night. The town of Girard is small and quaint, but we were mostly in Fort Scott for a college softball tournament, so we were about 30 minutes away. The drive was worth it but it would have been nicer if we were closer so we could have come back to the house in-between games because the house was so comfortable and cute. Thank you, Marie and Curt for sharing your home with us. The renovation and remodel you did on the house was remarkable."

Stayed a few nights","We picked this listing above others for a few reasons, including the private location, newer home, and the soaking tub, all of which was great! This place was a nice stay, but for us, who use Airbnb quite often, it was a little “bare bones” as my husband put it. We contacted host ahead of time to clarify that there were no toiletries (shampoo/conditioner/body wash) and I had read another review about bringing in bottled water, so we felt prepared. However, we still found ourselves at Walmart buying an extra blanket, basics like salt and pepper, things that we’re used to having provided. We did appreciate the granola bars that were there when we checked in, and the description of the home is accurate. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay there again!"

Stayed with a pet","This location was perfect for the needs of our family to visit our son at Pitt State. We were able to bring our/his dogs along, which was a big bonus. Minor recommendation(s) for host (From my wife.) are, adding more light (Maybe a motion detector flood light.) to the driveway area for after dark check in. Also the fridge, stove and dishwasher could use a little deep clean to them but they were not disgusting or unusable by any means. If you are not used to hard, sulfur tasting water, you should consider bringing or buying your own drinking water and use for the coffee machine as well. That is not a bad mark against the host, it’s just the way the water is in the area. My wife wanted to mention there are no scissors in the home so if you think you might need to cut something open, bring your own pair. (Insert eye roll at my wife. Host was very responsive to messages before during and after our visit. Highly recommend this location if you are visiting the area of Pittsburgh, KS."

Stayed with a pet","Description as a ""luxury apartment"" is inaccurate. Couch was stained, frayed and broken on one end. Bedroom lights constantly flickered, most likely an electrical issue. Sheets were 100% polyester and towels were a thin polyester blend. Only one, thin blanket in each room, and it was a cold few days (highs only in the teens). No toiletries, no streaming services (wifi only). A delapidated old truck, covered in debris, with a flat and broken mirrors sat out front, making it feel a bit shady. Definitely not a luxury experience."

Place was clean and close proximity to campus which is exactly what we needed. Will stay here again when I need a place for the weekend in Pitt.

Stayed a few nights","This was 1/2 of a duplex. It was the perfect size for 4 adults. It was easy to access and checking in and out was very convenient. It’s advertised as a 3 bedroom, but is 2 bedroom with a pull out type sofa in the living room. She did tell me this after I inquired prior to booking so I wasn’t surprised. However, the sofa was stained and would not have been a good option for an adult to sleep comfortably. I didn’t remember seeing there were several stairs to get to the bedrooms. Not a problem for us but maybe for others this would be an issue. I’m originally from this area so I wasn’t surprised by the neighborhood but the house two doors down was burning trash for most of our visit and the smell was awful. That being said overall I was pleased."

Everything you could need is stocked in the kitchen. The decor throughout is thoughtful, top-notch and has adorable bee influence. Our kids loved fishing in the pit, the ladder golf, giant connect 4 and walking around the area spotting frogs and seeing the beautiful lily pads and turtles in the front pond. We hope to return next year and make it a family tradition."

Stayed a few nights","My wife and in laws stayed at the Miller Mansion in Pittsburg to celebrate Thanksgiving since my parents live here. We were all enthralled with the attention to detail of the house as part of the renovation work recently done on it. Aside from the beautiful furniture and light fixtures, the decor was seasonally appropriate which made our celebration even more special.
Being a fan of homes of this era, I explored every corner and was not disappointed. The kitchen and dining room were properly appointed which allowed us to have a full Thanksgiving meal before retiring to the third floor to play dominoes on the card table.
We used two of the larger rooms and both beds were very comfortable. The 4 bathrooms also made it extremely convenient for our two groups. The two managers of the property were very responsive with every step of the reservation.
In closing, I cannot think of a better place to stay while visiting Pittsburg!"

We decided to return to the area for this years’ reunion and we couldn’t have been more pleased with our decision. This home is beautiful, and had enough space to allow us privacy while also allowing us plenty of opportunity for gathering.
We loved exploring all the fun ‘nooks and crannies’ of this historic home. The secret room - what fun!
Highly recommend for reunions and family groups. It would also be a great venue for bridal showers and smaller weddings- there is room to dance on the third floor.
Thank you, Dani, for everything!

It was so spacious and the pictures did not do it justice. Cassie was an amazing host and was always responsive to anything I needed. It is right in the heart of downtown and there are lots of places to walk to for dining. The Hive is probably one of my favorite airbnb's we have stayed in. I was there with my husband and family for a wedding and we all loved it! Highly recommend!"

The attention to detail in the design and decor truly created an inviting atmosphere that made us feel right at home. The Hive boasts spacious bedrooms with plush beds and soft linens. The Hive's location was ideal for our weekend getaway. It's conveniently situated near the heart of Pittsburg, making it easy for us to explore local attractions, restaurants, and shops. The hosts provided us with a list of recommendations for things to do in the area and made sure we had everything we needed for a fantastic stay. The cleanliness of The Hive impressed us all. We couldn't have asked for a better place to bond and create lasting memories during our girls' weekend. Thank you for a truly memorable experience! We can't wait to return!"

Group trip","Comparable to the local hotels in price and offering so much more, The Hive was a great decision for our family trip to Pittsburg to attend a wedding. The amenities were abundant, every you need and more to eat, drink and be merry. It also served as a gathering spot for all of our family on our way to and from Pittsburg. Cassie’s was a gracious and understanding host in that regard. The young men really enjoyed the local night life. I found the cutest thrift store downstairs. Our only problem was we didn’t have enough time and wish we could have stayed a few more days. You will find comfy beds and hot showers!"

Stayed a few nights","This is an Airbnb that exceeds all expectations. It's vaster and more beautiful even than the excellent photos, and there is ample space for a family or group or friends to meet here. In fact, the whole apartment is larger than our home. It's also extremely nice, lovely, classy, comfortable, and adaptable for hanging out, watching TV, sharing meals, meeting or whatever else. The back bedroom is far enough from the front living room that it's easy to find complete quiet in the back even when people in the front are visiting. The value is also astonishing. Finally, as a bathtub lover, I have to say that the bathtub in the back bedroom is lovely, comfortable, and very relaxing. I will definitely be back!"

Everyone loved touring the space and commented again and again on how wonderful everything was. It is literally just beautiful. A small group of us cooked together, and the kitchen was a great workspace. The keypad lock was super handy for in and out. The Broadway view was great! We enjoyed walking around downtown and visiting all of the fun shops, including The Doggie Bag right below. The walk to 505 across the street is also super handy. Thank you for an amazing stay in an amazing location in a beautiful space. We have already booked again for the wedding weekend. 🙂"

Everyone in our group loved the location of The Hive. We walked to breakfast and dinner each evening, but would’ve been perfectly content ordering in and hanging out in the massive living/dining/entertainment spaces. Bedrooms and bathrooms suited our groups needs perfectly as well. The Hive is as good in person as it looks in the photos. Check in and out were extremely easy. Thanks to Cassie and her team for creating a great place to stay. We’ll definitely stay again when we return to Pittsburgh."

Stayed a few nights","I can’t rave enough about this place…
It was more than we expected, the tub was amazing and the view over downtown was just awesome… It has a San Francisco vibe in a small town. All of the little extras were great. My teen girls loved all of the picture spots 😆 the hive has ( decor was 🔥)… The space was fantastic and the thrift store below was adorable (it supports the local animal shelter)
Definitely showed and recommended it to everyone at the family reunion, for future travels…
You definitely have to try the bird scooters a special if you’ve never done before parked right in front of the unit… we rode to Braums for ice cream. I think we were laughing the whole way… The plan was to ride them around Downtown Pittsburgh but after ice cream we were too full

There are steps up to the 2nd floor apartment. The check in was easy. Cassie communicates quickly and was very accommodating. The weekend we booked was crazy with graduations and weddings and we felt lucky to get this space. We expected the costs to be higher since everywhere in Pittsburg was full. Very fortunate to stay here and will book again if we need a 3 bedroom place!"

The Hive is beautifully decorated and well maintained. The ambience and aesthetic of the loft apartment was awesome. Loved the unique antique decor and attention to detail.
Hosts have thought of lots of wonder additions for the property to make the stay even more comfortable and a home away from home.
