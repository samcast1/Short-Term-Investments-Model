Stayed a few nights",I visited DeKalb for a work trip and Jessica’s listing was the perfect home away from home. The location was great for commuting to work and close by downtown restaurants. I appreciated the amenities like being able to park in the garage and access the workout equipment in the basement. The living spaces were cozy and welcoming. Would stay again!

Group trip","The Nordic Mid Century Retreat was the absolute best! My family was in town for the funeral of my father and Jessica's home was our home base for the week. Immediately upon entry, it felt comforting and therapeutic. There was plenty of space for us to all be together but not on top of each other. The beds were very comfortable and there were plenty of kitchen tools for us to prepare a couple meals- even a crockpot thank goodness! Jessica even messaged us one morning regarding the potential for icy roads. In spite of the sad reason for the visit, we truly enjoyed staying in Jessica's home! We come back to the area occasionally and would love to stay again! Thank you!"

Jessica (and team) made sure the walkway and driveway were shoveled more than once...it was greatly appreciated. The house had a king size bed which is hard to find and almost a must for us. Would definitely recommend this AirBnB to others!"

Riverside view was fantastic, decor was well thought out (the light switches were appreciated by these switches), and great downtime space.
Many fantasies were realized.
Thank you!

Group trip","The river house was nice, and had a lot of great items in the kitchen for cooking and living room for entertaining. The grill didn’t work, but we enjoyed the large fire pit and they had a lot of wood to burn and cookware to put meat in to roast over the fire so we were able to make meals over the fire which was nice. Bring a lighter though because starting the fire was an interesting achievement for us day one, but day two we were able to keep it going from the night before. The water pressure wasn’t that great, but the bathrooms were fully stocked, and clean. The kids had a great time listening to records, and playing their guitar. We all enjoyed river view, their canoe is gorgeous, and while we didn’t catch any fish, it was a charming, cozy stay in a nice river home. Our children had a blast!"

The house was in pristine condition and had ALL the amenities you would need. Truly all you need to bring is food, the rest is already there to enjoy! You can tell that Elizabeth has spent a lot of care and time into making sure her guests enjoy their stay. She was very friendly and easy to communicate with.
The location is right on the Rock River and close to surrounding towns. You don't need to leave, but if you do, there are many things close in the area to enjoy.

My husband and I enjoyed cooking in the open kitchen. So nice to cook in a kitchen that is set up by someone that cooks. We especially liked the beautiful wood cutting boards. We both slept great each night. So private and peaceful. We reluctantly left to go hiking each day. We look forward to staying here again in the future.

Elizabeth was proactive, kind and easy to communicate with, even in the middle of a major life event. She shared local recommendations and pointed us to various resources at home for our kid. We cooked, had a campfire, hiked at nearby trails, took walks around the property, and cozied up next to the fireplace with a book and hot chocolate.
Will definitely be going back for the summer!"

Stayed a few nights","One of my favorite airbnbs so far! I was looking for a waterfront place, and this country home by the river was perfect. My friend and I would take our chairs and sit and read or talk down by the river...so peaceful watching the river and the fish jump. The house itself is decorated with a quiet palette, and the way the kitchen is stocked with spices and pots and pans (even vanilla!) and the bathroom has extra toothpaste in a drawer, feels very thoughtful and welcoming. My bed was very comfortable as well. The only possible drawback, which doesn't deter me from coming back, is that there is some periodic road noise from Illinois 2, but you don't hear it in the house."

Stayed with kids","If I could give this place 6 or 7 stars, I would. With Airbnb filled to the rafters with perfectly acceptable but soulless accommodation, this is throw back to the platform's early days.
Elizabeth's house backs on to the Rock River, and it's off the main road so it's wonderfully secluded. Outside the main things we heard were cicadas and the river. It's so relaxing.
Inside, the house has been tastefully renovated and feels lived in. The kitchen is stocked with almost every item imaginable, the cookware is top grade, and there are plenty of condiments and spices to make tasty meals. (Side hint: get some local corn, it's crazy sweet and delicious.)
The couch, and beds are all very comfortable. And although we only spent a few nights here, we felt fully refreshed.
There's plenty to do at house too with canoes, a zip line, fishing gear, plenty of kids' toys, and board games.
Internet is available, but it's slow, which was great for our needs, but not if you want to work remotely."

We also brought some fishing gear because there were poles, but nothing to use to fish with. All-in-all it was a fabulous experience."

The beds were super comfy and clean, along with plenty of washed towels available in both restrooms, the living room area was also very cozy and comfortable. Elizabeth was also a great host, she was very responsive and made sure check in went well as well as check out. The River house also had everything you might need for your stay. We enjoyed our stay and would book again:)"

Stayed with kids","We wanted a country getaway for our family (kids aged 2, 4, and 7), and we could not have asked for a better time. The house is stocked with joys for kids: games, toys, a mini kitchen and chalk board, and even a vintage school desk filled with art supplies. The kids' room had everything you would need if you had smaller children: baby monitors, a pack & play, portable high chair, etc. Outside there is a mowed pathway along the river (no swimming due to the current) and the garage had lots of treasures for kids and adults alike: a canoe, fishing poles, a ""bags"" set, and other outdoor games. There is even a mini zip line my kids spent hours on, dragging one another back / forth. With four bedrooms, everyone slept comfortably and peacefully. There is a motion detector light in the hallway for middle-of-the-night needs. We visited during the Ogle County Fair, so between carnival rides, cotton candy, running/zipping around the River House, my 7 year old said it was the best day of her life!"

Stayed a few nights","My wife needed some time to reconnect with nature in a beautiful setting and a slower pace of life for a few days. This place absolutely delivered.
THE SETTING: the drive to the home through small towns, state parks and rolling hills is a retreat in and of itself.
THE PROPERTY: After you drive down a narrow paved drive, you come to a gravel road path which immediately reminds you that life is now slower and simpler and to pump the brakes and look around. The old home looks like a miniature farm house mansion-of-old. The pictures on the Airbnb site are nice, but pale in comparison to the actual charm we felt pulling up. Out back it's just you, trees & the Rock River.
THE HOUSE: Nice modern finishes coupled with vintage touches. The kitchen has everything you may need, most brand new, including a Brita in the fridge with filtered H2O, a stocked Keurig, appliances, etc. FYI there is no recycling on site. Upstairs there are four perfectly quant bedrooms with new bathrooms. We'll be back"

Well equipped kitchen and sports stuff. Pool isn't heated and can be a tad cold since the trees shade it well, but on the whole a lovely place. Recommend it."

The view from the patio will send you back in time when you could see for miles and hear only the sounds of nature. My dog was in heaven with tons of space and places to sniff and explore. I plan on revisiting many times. LHOTP is a definite keeper.

All I wanted was a place that had lots of space for the dogs to roam freely, run, and sniff. This place was amazing! There were 2 homes near us, but we didn't see or hear any of the neighbors! Always careful when it gets dark (especially with pets and children), we do believe to have seen a wolf."

Stayed with a pet","My girlfriend and I had an amazing long weekend here. We saw at least 40 bison pass by in the backyard which was a highlight of the trip.
Apart from the fantastic scenery, the house was well-organized and had everything you might think you need to pack. Seasonings, appliances, coffee, etc. It was a very hot weekend and we were concerned about staying cool, but the ac system they had was more than enough to keep us completely cool while we were in the house.
We also noticed some past reviews about spotty wifi, but they must’ve made an upgrade because the wifi was perfectly fast and we had no issues. Same with the Roku tv.
This place is special and at a very reasonable price. I highly recommend you stay here given the chance."

Our only disappointment was that we didn’t get to see the bison on our short, 1 night stay. It’s obviously in the country but we didn’t take into account that the roads might be snow packed, there was a couple of slick spots but nothing that wasn’t manageable. We will definitely be booking again when we go back to visit family."

It is easy to feel as though you are in the middle of nowhere, yet it is quick and easy to reach in under a couple of hours from Chicago. The bison were even right by the backyard fence to greet us, along with a beautiful sunset, on the day we arrived. We loved how quiet it was and how many stars you could see at night. We enjoyed playing board games and going for hikes in the many local state parks. We were so sad to leave! LHOTP has just about everything you could possibly need to be self sufficient and Earl & Patricia were always on hand and quick to respond to any questions, or provide suggestions for places to visit. We will definitely be back!"

Stayed a few nights","Little House on the Prairie is amazing. Earl was very accommodating, and he responded within a few minutes (literally a few minutes, less than five) to any questions we had.
We saw the bison herd several times over the weekend. They never came near the fence at LHOTP, but we saw them at the visitor center and while driving around. We did see deer and a coyote and other wildlife from the back patio.
We were delighted to see how well-stocked LHOTP is. We have been to many vacation properties in our travels, but we certainly over-packed for this one.
Some of the things we always take on vacations but could have left at home:
• A good variety of spices. In fact, there is a cabinet pretty much devoted to spices. We brought a couple of our favorites that LHOTP didn't have, but we could have saved the space and not packed our own at all.
• Ice
• Ketchup, mustard, mayo, Cholula, butter, a brand new unopened block of Monterey Jack cheese, Sriracha, and many other things. The frig door shelves were full of all kinds of goodies.
• Coffee, tea, bottled water, creamers
• Sugar
• Hand soap for the kitchen and bathroom
• Bug sprays
I could go on.
The only negative thing I have to say is the internet is a little iffy. But is that really a negative thing when you're trying to get away for a peaceful weekend? It just helped us realize that there were better things to do than to be checking emails.
All in all, LHOTP is a great get-away spot. We definitely will be going back!"

It was everything that was described in the listing. When you first pull up to the property you would never know how cute the inside is or how vast the backyard and bison reserve behind the house was.
The cottage is an open floor concept and is very spacious. The kitchen area has tons of stuff to use and every cabinet and door is labelled. No confusions finding anything.
The Bison never came near the backyard while we were there, but we went to the Bison welcome center three times. The welcome center is down the road and we got to see the herd everytime we went. We also got to view other wildlife while we were there. The sunsets and sunrises were breath taking!"

It was a very quiet spot which is exactly what we wanted. We only saw the bison once down the road near the visitor center. Plan on downloading things to watch before you arrive as the wifi is weak. A nice place with very responsive, helpful hosts."

The home is a lot bigger than it looks in pictures and it was SO clean. The wifi wasn’t very strong, probably enough to get messages out but that wasn’t hugely important for us on our unplugged weekend. They have plenty of movies and board games and almost everything you need to have a unwinding time there. And they even have a grill (with propane) that we used to bbq every night. We even got lucky and saw the peaceful bison each day.
I can’t say enough that you should definitely check this place out! We will definitely be back."

We've never brought our dog to an Abnb before and wondered if allowing dogs would impact the home's cleanliness, etc. Wow - super-clean... cleaner than some stays we've had where pets aren't allowed (no pet smells or anything like that). We stayed in and cooked most of our meals and found everything we needed and more. Seriously - this is Airbnb done right. We loved the view of the rolling hills and bison in the backyard - so neat to see the bison roaming in the snow. Stand outside at night and listen to what silence really is, such a peaceful place. Brighter stars than I've seen in a long time. Thanks so much for having us.

The host, Earl, is so accommodating. We really appreciated the communication and the amenities at the house. Comfy beds and pillows, a well stocked kitchen with utensils and plates, glasses, games in the hutch and a nice open floor plan made for a great girls weekend. This is a convenient location for us to meet our friends from Chicago for a girls’ weekend. We will be back!"

Being a bow hunter I was able to hunt a nearby state forest and the Franklin Creek area. Earl has a found a unique way to make this B&B a quiet, restful home away from home. Can't wait to return!!"

I stayed one night with my two small dogs and the owners were super accommodating. Well stocked pantry and fridge. Easy to find even though on country roads for a bit. No wifi or TV but phone and texting works. Super clean, really comfortable beds. Can see tons of stars in the night sky and hear buffalo snorting and lowing."

Stayed one night","Had a wonderful stay at LHOTP!!! The view out the back window of the Nachusa Grasslands was perfect!!! The bison herd was on the other side of the road, but a few of the big boys hung around. I was treated to a wrestling match between a couple of the young males!! You could hear the clacking of their horns and some of their snorts!!! That same evening as the sun was just going down, a couple of deer moved into view. One little doe stuck around for a snack & then bedded down for a bit underneath a small pine tree. I sat & watched her for nearly 30 minutes....so quiet, so peaceful & a lovely place. Will definitely be back!!!"

Stayed a few nights","Earl's place is perfect. We were looking for a low key place in the country to enjoy long bike rides and walks in the woods. We found that, along with daily communing with the bison herd. We woke up Saturday morning, looked out the window and a small herd of bison were having their breakfast just on the other side of the fence - magical.
The house is much bigger than I thought it was going to be. The beds and couches are very comfy. The kitchen is huge and very well stocked - pretty much everything you would need - including a waffle iron and maple syrup!
There is so much to do in the area, lots of hiking and biking opportunities.
We had a fabulous weekend and hope to be back."

The kayaks were a huge plus since the river is steps away from the cabin. The town was small but the people were nice to talk to and they have trails around the area to hike and experience peace. It was very clean and met all of our expectations.

We bought firewood from the local grocery store called SuperValu. There was a grill at the cabin but at the time we were there the propane tank felt empty. You can replace the tank at the SuperValu. We also enjoyed taking out the kayaks and there were a few life jackets available in the cabin so that was nice. The inside of the cabin was very clean and spacious.

They have wood on site to buy so you don’t have to travel. Local honey is available on site. Great fire pit to hang out in the evening. Keep in mind that you are on the main river and need to bring vests for the kayaks."

The two living spaces are so great for separate spaces for adult/kids. The large windows make you feel one with nature. Outside you’ll find rustic surroundings along the river. You may even see eagles fly over like we did. Evenings are best spent around the fire pit roasting s’mores. We were a little skeptical pulling in, but once you find it and settle in it’s a great cabin getaway. Bring life jackets if you have kids running around. Also boots if it’s spring (mud). Fishing poles are an excellent idea. And a book to cozy up by fire."

The riverfront is fantastic, and the property is nicely set up to maximize both outdoor enjoyment and indoor appreciation of it... the porch windows have a terrific view.
The house is cozy but could comfortably fit a bigger group, and it is well appointed with everything you'd need for a family vacation. The local area has great parks and hiking opportunities- we really enjoyed the Nachusa Grasslands and White Pines Forest State Park and look forward to checking out Castle Rock State Park when we return!"

We enjoyed laying in the yard birding (bring your good binoculars!) and reading so much, we only left the property to go tubing one day (highly recommended, through White Pelican!)
We cooked a ton with a plenty stocked kitchen and enjoyed the fire pit.
On our way out of town we stopped at the amazing Flamingo Palace antique shop and a few other surrounding stores.
We are already thinking of coming again to explore hiking and cooler temps!
The house was clean, comfortable, and with the greenery filled in, so secluded! I feel like it was better than the photos which seem to be mostly taken in winter. We prioritized our time outside. We don’t mind a little May Flies in our June though- this is riverside country chillin’ and if you hate nature, get lost! None of the bugs were biting, you’ll be fine.
Book it quick, City Slicker! (Oh! Don’t forget to flip through the photo album it’s amazing!)"

From the outside I thought the home didn't look too big but it does not feel like that on the inside. 3 decent sized bedrooms, bathroom, utility closet with washer & dryer, kitchen and living room with open floor plan, and a sunroom/dining room. The view from the sunroom is so beautiful. The decor and view give the cabin a very peaceful and relaxing vibe. The only bad part was the bugs. At least to a city girl, they're huge and there are so many. Because of the bugs we mostly stayed inside but we still enjoyed our stay so much. On the last day it was much cooler and there were very few bugs. Would love to come back again in the fall or winter. Heather is also a great host! She provided a brochure prior to our stay that had directions, a breakdown of what to expect in each room, things to do nearby, check out rules, etc. It had a ton of great information in it. She also checked in with us throughout our stay and was ready to help whenever needed. Thank you, Heather!"

The kitchen is fully stocked with everything you need to cook meals and enjoy them on the porch that has panoramic views of the rock river. The new fire pit area was a great spot that we made sure to enjoy every night. We had A bonfire and firewood was provided for $5 a bundle. We kayaked the first day and there is personal kayaks on property and a great launch point to be at one with the water!

Note: If visiting in the winter be prepared to walk over ice to get inside the cabin and ensure your car can handle driving on ice, not only an unpaved driveway.

Stayed with a pet","The few days we stayed it had rained quite a bit and with two pups, that means a lot of muddy paws. Telah was super accommodating and brought over extra towels and laundry soap to help. She always responded to any questions we had in a reasonable time. The place is well kept and had lots of useful amenities from the kitchen being nearly stocked with supplies to furniture covers so the dogs could also be comfortable. The location is perfect if you’re looking for somewhere peaceful outside of the city, but also close enough that you don’t spend a lot of the time on the road. Can’t wait for our next trip back!"

To be out in the country there plenty of amenities around, restaurants dollar general gas station. JC’s burger joint was delicious. It was quiet and peaceful. Apple TV downstairs. Next time I’m out that way I will definitely stay again!!!! Also the hot water wasn’t a big deal as I read in some other reviews"

Stayed a few nights","The overall stay was just okay. The home was large and the land was nice to walk around with the dogs. The listing advised that all dogs must be kenneled when left alone and that kennels were provided, the host knew we had 2 dogs, however when we arrived one kennel was broken and unusable. Had we been notified I would have brought an extra kennel. Many of the dishes were not clean, the stove handles were covered in grease and there was hair in the fridge. It was clear that the family had previously lived there and moved out leaving whatever they just didn't want. Including Christmas decorations up in September, the bedroom that I slept in still has the children's names on the wall, kitchen drawers and shelves with random garbage or a snack on random shelves. Lastly, the shower was a hazard. The home has a very small line between cold water, normal shower temperate and scalding death. While you work to figure that out the tub is not draining and instead filling with water at your feet. But be VERY careful, the plastic tub surround is not anti slip and the shower is somehow on a hill. One false step into the shower/bath and you go sliding face first into the wall. The basement couches were comfy, but you better have a Netflix account or you will be stuck watching one of the 4 tv channels and only 2 come in clearly. It was quiet and the barn cats were cute."

She was also able to fit two of our dogs in for a grooming session, after our groomer in Colorado canceled on us last minute. Our young, energetic dog enjoyed a day at doggy day camp when we visited my grandma in Dixon for the day with our older two pups. My kids enjoyed all the farm animals and we will definitely return for future visits."

My husband and I traveled with our dogs cross country over the holidays to find our forever home, and had to change AirBnB’s last minute. Telah was quick to respond to our inquiry and welcomed us to her home with open arms with just a few hours notice. The home is located on a large property which was wonderful for us to take our dogs on walks and play with them in the large fields. Telah has a beautiful family and had her children drop off some homemade donuts to us on Christmas morning which was extremely thoughtful. If we weren’t moving closeby, I’d stay here every time we visited. Thankfully she runs a dog boarding/grooming/training business, so I’ll be back anyway! :o) Communication and hospitality was the best from any AirBnB I’ve stayed at."

The house was charming and simple, but provided what I needed for a peaceful getaway from the city. I enjoyed sitting outside and having coffee on the patio in the mornings while listening to the sounds of nature. I also appreciated the selection VHS movies to watch on the tv which provided a fun retro vibe. The neighbors were all very friendly, and everyone smiles and waves when they see you.

Stayed a few nights","This is a very old house... as such there is an old house smell which to me was unappealing. The odor faded as I got used to it. Also, the exterior of the house, as you can see in the photos, has not been maintained. That said ... the inside is spacious and clean. I would not call the furnishings comfortable. There is no dresser in the downstairs bedroom or end tables, for example.Nothing that can't be worked around. All was adequate and useful to me for the purpose of my visit and a fair exchange for the rental fee.
The setting is lovely ... the neighborhood charming ... the location convenient to Rock River adventures. The host left a welcome book with restaurant suggestions. I visited two and the food was delicious.
Erin was responsive to me prior to the visit and sent me information so that I could pre-plan some of my day trips."

At my last stay on a scorchingly hot day after a very long work shift, I dreaded how warm it would be inside and how long it might take to cool down. How relieved and refreshed I was to find one of my thoughtful Hosts had kindly turned on the AC. Ahhhh, a welcoming homecoming in many ways!"

Stayed with kids","My family of 5 stayed here for a month. The box elder bugs were really bad from the moment we arrived. The hosts did what they can and were very responsive, but the outside of the house needs some major TLC. Until the windows are sealed, all the repellent in the world won’t keep the bugs from getting inside.
Aside from the bugs, the house is bright and welcoming, and clean otherwise. There was plenty of space for the 5 of us and had everything we needed for a long stay. The neighborhood is absolutely charming and there is a lot of space in the yard to play. It’s a short drive to Dixon. My husband works from home and had no issues with the internet. The hosts are helpful and did everything they can to make sure we enjoyed our stay. Even with the bugs (they are a spring time bug), I do recommend staying here. Grand Detour is such a peaceful area and the property is beautiful."

Stayed with kids","The location of this charming older home is perfect for peace, quiet, and a bit of history. Grand Detour has several historic houses and the number of large trees and the river just blocks away add to the ambience. The home's property is large and just blocks away from the John Deere museum. We loved walking the streets during our fall visit.
The downstairs bed was very comfortable and there were plenty of towels and blankets. The Wi-Fi worked very well during our stay and we didn't miss having cable T.V. since there was plenty to do during our visit.
Hubby and I live in a 150-year old home so we're used to the quirks of an older home. Erin's place has gorgeous wood floors downstairs with large windows throughout. The home could use a bit of maintenance. The exterior needs to be painted and the concrete at the bottom of the back steps is eroded and could prove to be dangerous for older folks or small children.
There are several parks in the area for hiking and exploring. Dixon is just a 5-minute drive and has the best coffee at Coffee Crush. Somkit, the Thai restaurant, was also very good and served the best sangria I've ever had. Hazel's in Oregon is also great for coffee and sandwiches. We also enjoyed dinner at the White Pines Lodge and had a seat right next to the fireplace.
I would stay here again. I'm a writer and this quiet retreat is perfect for a writer's retreat."

We will seriously miss having Jeff as our neighbor!
The house is cozy and charming, the property and trees are so beautiful, and the neighborhood is friendly and peaceful. Tons of state parks and beautiful grasslands to go see nearby. Grand Detour stole our hearts for sure! Thank you for an amazing summer, Jeff & Erin. Can’t wait to visit again!"

Stayed with kids","We were looking for a place to stay for a hiking weekend that included a visit to the Nachusa bison herd. This house was perfect: in the tiny town of Grand Detour, surrounded by a lovely, large yard (though not as large as the photos make it seem), and dog-friendly! This is clearly Grandma's old house--furnished with antiques, quilts and lace, and an ancient television. The kitchen is equipped for simple cooking (I spied a bread machine in the cupboard, so byo flour and yeast and you can have easy fresh-baked bread), and there's a Weber bbq outside, along with a fire pit and a horseshoes game area. Beds are comfy, wi-fi was OK. We brought a Roku stick and managed to find a USB port on the tv, so we could watch a movie. The hiking was lovely, especially at the Lowden-Miller state forest across the river. This is a great place to stay when you want to hike or bike or kayak...but you don't want to camp!"

Stayed with kids","I could say a lot of great things about our stay, but my wife has said only 1 was necessary. The ♥ BATHTUB ♥ . That's all! Now, my turn: quiet and peaceful place. The outside patio and grill was great! Plenty of room inside, both upstairs and down. Washer and dryer worked well. Heat and AC worked great too. Beds were comfortable and Kitchen was stocked decently. If I had to complain about anything, none of it really affected the stay. We didn't have a toaster. Bagel bummer, but the oven toasted fine. Internet was a little slow, but everything seems slow WHEN your home is gigabit fiber. The Japanese beetles were having their way with the ceilings and near windows, but EVERYWHERE around us showed no shortage of them either. And Ill take the beetles over skeeters any day! Lastly, It would have been nice to have a dresser in the downstairs bedroom, especially on an extended stay. Otherwise, all was good. Will return again!"

There’s lot of space to move around and have several activities going on at one time. There are stains on the carpets and farmhouse bugs but overall, the house was clean. The locks on the doors need to be updated and outdoor lighting is needed but with those additions, we would stay again.
The village is rich with history. It is filled with the cutest homes I’ve ever seen. A visit to the John Deere Historic site is a must! Grand Detour is a hidden gem!"

Stayed a few nights","Erin's house isn't perfect, but it is perfectly charming. If you are looking for a quiet getaway in a town that time forgot, Erin's place is it. We were looking for a place with good hiking and biking close to Chicago. We found that and more in Grand Detour.
My husband and I loved Erin's little farmhouse. First of all, Erin was very responsive to our needs. She and her neighbor Jeff are great hosts. There is a huge yard for the dogs to run in. The bed is very comfy, kitchen well stocked, and bathroom very clean. Nighttime in Grand Detour is silent - we slept like babies.
The town of Grand Detour was a huge surprise. It is tucked in a bend of the Rock River - you only had to walk a couple of blocks in either direction and you would be at the river's banks. It is home to John Deere's original house which is open to the public free of charge. It is also full of well preserved mid-19th-century homes which made for nice scenery on our evening strolls.
Nearby are the Nachusa Grasslands which is home to a wild buffalo herd - bring binoculars! There are numerous state parks for hiking, and the rolling country roads are perfect for long bike rides.
Erin's little farmhouse in Grand Detour was the perfect base for our explorations."

This is wonderful place to kick your feet up, turn off the phone, and reconnect with nature and the star filled sky. Thank you to Erin for being such a great hostess.

Stayed a few nights","We had a wonderful time at Ryan and Cas’s house in Byron. It was so nice to get away for a long, relaxing fall weekend in the country. Their house is very clean and comfortable, and stocked with everything we needed. The road along the river that fronts the house does get the occasional loud traffic, but for the most part, it was a very quiet, peaceful and private setting. It's a nice short drive to Lowden State Park for hiking, and into both towns of Byron and Oregon for dining. We took advantage of the beautiful autumn weather and sat on the back patio with the fire pit, reading books and enjoying some beverages. We would definitely stay again!"

We are 2 kids and 2 adults and had a blast canoeing on the river through White Pelican, going on a goat hike at Greta’s Goats (I think a monthly event they hold - as cute as it sounds), a story hike through a prairie and forest at the Jarrett Prairie Center, and playtime and a hike at the Severson Dells. Oh and the Discovery Center in Rockford, which is also just a half hour away. The space is comfortable and cute and we saw the stars and a fox and the TV was great too. :) Overall a very fun spot for anyone who wants some time in nature without camping!"

Stayed a few nights","Overall our stay was great. We really enjoyed our time in the peaceful setting just across the Rock River. Having the windows open brought in such a beautiful, cooling breeze, even when it was 80 outside - there was an amazing cooling effect of the area. The downside to this was all of the traffic on the road just a few feet away - cars are speeding up from a residental speed trap just down the road so it can be quite loud at times. We saw quite a bit of wildlife just around the house in the small subdivision just to the south (Foxes, raccoons, ground hog). If you have time you need to visit the Byron Preserve/Jarrett Prairie Center - so many trails and beautiful scenery. You may already be aware but the Byron Nuclear Power Plant is situatied just a few miles away."

Stayed with kids","A wonderful place to get away for a couple days! The cottage was perfect for our family of 3, just enough space to spread out and then come back together for meals and TV time. We enjoyed having morning coffee on the front porch and sitting around a fire at night in the back. The house is remarkably insulated from outside noise, even though just a few hundred yards from a busy road. There are no convenient walking trails near the house, but a short drive away is the Byron Forest Preserve and Lowden State Park where you can visit the Lorado Taft field campus. We highly recommend the Hairy Cow Brewing Company - their beer is fantastic and pizza was amazing. You can sit on their nice outdoor deck for picturesque views of the river. The Sweet Bean Cafe and Bakery was wonderful as well. All in all, well worth it. Ryan and Cas were great hosts, will definitely return!"

Ryan and Cass have thoughtfully provided everything you might need. We did suggest an outdoor table and chairs on the back patio. They do have nice Adirondack chairs, outdoor rockers, a new grill, and a great fire pit with plenty of wood. The house is located near three beautiful state parks- we enjoyed hiking at all three of them. Great places to eat and drink in both Oregon and Byron. One negative was the noise of the traffic on the River Road where the house sits. But I wouldn’t let that deter you from going."

The ranch is beautiful and it was a delight to visit with the horses in the evening at the fence, and then again in the morning to hear more about their stories while Carol tended to them. My cats, fiancé, and I felt welcomed to the space and we all slept hard in the quiet, rural location. Highly recommend!"

Instead view is of road and fields which are perfectly fine views but not what was expected. Welcoming touches provided by host is not enough to make up for sagging mattress and other furniture, or the inoperable tv in the bedroom or minuscule shower that has good water pressure but only fits you if you are well under 6’ tall. If the hosts solve these issues and tell you more clearly that the apartment is attached to the main house, it would be a spotless and good and quiet choice."

Stayed with a pet","This is one of the best AirBnb's we have ever stayed in. Is just outside town on a paved road. The guest quarters are an apartment attached to the host's house. The hosts went over and above to provide more than what is typically available, such as fresh food, so that guests don't have to turn around and run into town for supplies to make it through the next morning. There is a stackable washer and dryer that we used while we made our own dinner and played a board game from the closet. We have driven through this area before, so we know there are lots of good restaurants available, especially the Italian one in Cherry Valley. The owners welcome dogs, cats, and horses, and provided food and water dishes and treats for dogs. If you bring dogs, be aware that the hosts have 3 dogs that run loose and the guest house is right by the road without a fenced yard. I would highly recommend this Airbnb to 1-3 people with pets or horses, and who enjoy a quiet rural setting."

Stayed with a pet",Pheonmenal. One of the best airbnbs I have stayed in. Loved the dog treats and provided breakfast. interior is clean and modern. What I would want in my own home. Would give 6 stars if I could. Wish we stayed longer. Only thing I can think of is that I wasnt aware of much to do in Rockford. We were just passing through and needed somewhere to stay.

The sincerity truly shows with how kindly they stock the kitchen and that was greatly appreciated after such a long trip. Bed was comfortable and smelled so good. It was also nice actually having large fluffy towels for once in an air bnb. Amazing place. Also set on a beatiful road which was great to walk our dogs.

While we shared one door with the main home it was not a bother and any noise heard was never very early morning or late evening.
We had our cat with us and we really appreciated that there were no little places she could hide in/get stuck in.

Stayed a few nights","This place was ok, it is above a storefront in downtown Rochelle and I arrived on a weekend night and there was blasting music well into the night (2am plus) so be prepared for that. I don't know if it was coming from the bar below the building or what.
Overall it was ok, the shower takes awhile to heat up and the shower drain is VERY slow so you'll have water up to your ankles before you're done.
The wifi also appears to come from the bar at the opposite end of the building and on the other floor so my phone would lose connection when in the living room and switch over to 5G (brand new iphone 15 pro max) If in the kitchen or closer it would keep connected."

I also appreciated the fan (the street below can be noisy at night but the fan helps to block out some noise). There is also a cute shop below. The air was a little stale and smelled like someone had smoked in there years ago and the smell was trapped in the walls. I had to leave my windows open which was no problem because it was beautiful outside but just something to note if you're sensitive to cigarette smoke smell like I am.

They met us as we drove in with a beautiful welcome... but absolutely gave us our own space/time after that ! 
Available to answer any questions that we had.

Mary is just the best! She met us upon arrival and is so warm and welcoming, generous and hospitable. The shedominium is awesome. It is spacious, practical, comfortable, immaculately clean, and the attention to detail is mind blowing. The design and theme are so well coordinated. The bed is comfortable, as is the huge sofa in the living area. The kitchen is fun and well appropriated! The sheep and chickens are amazing and such a treat. We enjoyed the beautiful sunset and sunrise. This is a total experience, not just a place to sleep. The town is precious and so serene. We look forward to coming back and spending more time in this gem of a place. Thank you Mary for welcoming us into your beautiful world."

The Hairy Cow restaurant in nearby Byron was excellent. There are a lot of forest preserves in the area. The air conditioner is right by the bed and we found it a bit loud so we just turned it off at night and found we didn’t need it. It had cooled the place down enough already during the day. The TV has cable but it is not “smart.” Our cell service worked well so it didn’t matter and we watched a DVD anyway from the many provided. Host was very responsive. Would definitely stay again!

I took a walk in the morning around the property to see their animals, the sheeps and I had a conversation, the roosters came over to see what the fuse was all about and the goats I adored. There is no WiFi, which I LOVED. They had plenty of movies to choose from if you want to watch TV. All in all we loved the Shedominium and look forward to returning."

Stayed one night","Mary's place exceeded our expectations! As other reviewers said, it was cute, comfortable, and CLEAN! My husband couldn't stop talking about how clean it was. The grounds were so peaceful. We loved visiting the animals. It was a tiring day for us, so we really appreciated the water and coffee. The retro décor was so cute but not over-done. There was plenty of storage space. Bedding and towels were soft. As someone said, it was much bigger than expected. For example, the photo in the bedroom looks like the A/C is really close to the bed, but there is actually quite a bit of space there. Although there is no stove, there is an electric fry pan and crockpot.
Two things that were added bonuses!
1. Hooks! There were tons of hooks for towels, jackets, hoodies, purses etc.
2. I am a petite woman, and this is probably the first AirBNB I've stayed at where I could actually reach all the dishes I needed!
Thanks, Mary!
We hope to be back"

It is hard to see from the road but Mary sent me a message letting me know that and there is also a large sign with the house number at the end of the driveway. She was very friendly and helpful. The place is roomy and I like the corrugated metal walls and design of it. They even had some sheep and goats that my daughter loved. The only downside is there was not internet available but we did have good phone service so that was not a major issue. Overall it was a great place and we will definitely stay here again when back in the area.

It is even cuter than the photos, absolutely spotless, has a great new bed, hot showers, and in an easy location off the freeway. This special cottage and the delightful hosts should not be missed. Highly recommended!"

Lots to do nearby and yet the country feel of this place with the animals we were able to pet made it feel more like home. Cleanliness was really perfect. Mary was friendly and communicated perfectly. Thanks for helping make our weekend special!

The air bnb itself is a perfect size with a super comfortable couch and a unique dining table booth.
I didnt get to see the beautiful sunrises because I used to trip to sleep in but the stars were very pretty at night.
Mary had tons of DVDs and we watched 3 movies during our stay.
Highly recommended, amazing host and gorgeous place to stay"

The only thing lacking for some people or perhaps for longer stays is that there is no WIFI service in the apartment. We knew that fact and we did not miss it for our short stay. We loved the country setting, the view of the sun rise and soybean fields, and the quiet. Mary responded to all our questions and was most welcoming. There are wonderful back roads to explore on bikes in this region. We could see coming here again."

Stayed a few nights","What a beautiful experience!!!
A Home Away From Home.
Starting with the perfect name, Shedominium , it not only sums up the structure itself, but also harnesses the feeling of true farmland country comfort.
It’s just far enough out of the town of Byron and its neighboring villages to give you the proper rural escape, but close enough to drive into town and pick up those last minute provisions.
The decor is a balance of a 50’s diner layered in a Machine Shed’s agricultural metal siding and the welcoming feel of a close relative’s house.
Mary was there if we ever needed anything. We ran into each other after my trip into town to pick up Casey’s doughnuts.
She is a wonderful, genuine and accommodating hostess.
As it states in their description, there is no Wifi access. So take care of your business prior to your arrival!
My girl and I actually found it quite liberating to step away from the land of streaming and instant gratification.
Their DVD collection is rather vast so there’s many an option to fancy anybody’s taste for that evening entertainment.
There’s also a few board game options as well. I won a solid 2 out of 3 matches in Checkers!
If you’re prime to waking up early to catch the sunrise, you can have the chance to get a glimpse of the wild turkeys that roam the land. They gave us quite the smile to start off our day.
End all Be All, there isn't enough compliments I can give to this establishment. It was exactly what we needed.
If you’re in the area and need a bit of an escape, I highly recommend swinging by the Shedominium and pulling up to the Welcome Sign."

It was very clean and neat so that in these day's with ""the virus"" we felt very safe and protected. We knew she was there if we needed something but we were given our privacy. It was great to be able to enjoy the beautiful sunrise views we had every morning and were able to sit outside and watch the cornfield get harvested. My husband would have loved to jump on the combine and help as he helped several farmers at harvest time. He enjoyed that very much! I know for certain if anybody were to want a wonderful relaxing place to kick back and chill out I would recommend it. On a scale of 1 to 10 I would give her a ten plus. Thank you Mary for our 5 day stay."

It is freshly renovated, modern, fun, and did not have a speck of clutter. Perfectly decorated and unique. The furniture was very comfortable and clean as shown in the photos. The kitchen had everything we needed. Finally, it was super easy to find. We hope to return next year. Highly recommended!"

But the more important thing is they’re just a lovely family with a lovely home and the experience has always been just terrific. Highly recommended.
As I’ve mentioned before, the home is in a very peaceful neighborhood, but very close to downtown Dekalb with all of the restaurants and most importantly to me proximity to northern Illinois university. At night the neighborhood is extremely quiet and that along with the extraordinarily comfortable bed always makes for a great night of sleep. as I said before, if I could give the experience more than 10 stars, I would"
