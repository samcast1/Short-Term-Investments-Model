The apartment furniture is high quality and comfortable and the kitchen is well equipped.

Stayed one night","Beautiful and comfortable place! Provided everything we needed, even after forgetting to pack a couple things. Loved the extra effort they put into the little details around the house, from the coffee and snack bar, lighted wardrobe spaces and luxury hair care products in the master to the beautiful private outdoor patio space. The design throughout the home flowed seamlessly and was modern and elegant with hidden gems throughout. It was not too minimalistic but not over decorated or cluttered, but in my opinion perfectly done. The kitchen was fully stocked if wanting to utilize. The place was also just a couple blocks from down town. Check in and out instructions were very simple and clear. I did not feel that the check out instructions asked of us were excessive. If staying in town again I will definitely be staying here. I would highly recommend."

Stayed a few nights","What an amazing place! Beautiful from the moment we walked in the gate and through the front door, it continued throughout the whole house. Beautiful main living ceiling very unique was just an added unexpected touch.
Close to downtown making it easy to walk to dinner and activities. Close to the campus as well, just a short 5 minute drive.
One thing that I really appreciated was the showers. I am taller (6’3”) and it is often hard to find a shower head that I don’t have to duck to get my head wet. The shower was plenty tall and very spacious plenty of room. All in all this was as wonderful place and I would highly recommend. I plan on it the next time I visit."

Stayed about a week","My wife and I stayed for a week in October, and I can't imagine there's a better AirBNB in Salina. It's in Downtown, and walkable to so many amenities and community features. The unit is a nicely remodeled older brick building, with original walls and exterior retained. The interior is well-equipped and tastefully furnished. Bob is local, and was quick to communicate with us.
We'll stay here again next time we visit Salina."

I stayed here for a couple of days for work and really enjoyed my stay! This place was very cozy and clean. With large floor to ceiling windows, very high ceilings, large TV, and beautifully updated bathroom. Every bit of this place exceeded my expectations, even the small personal touches like: cookies, bottled water and k-cups for coffee. There is no kitchen ( which I didn’t need) but there is a mini fridge and microwave. Thank you Jane!!"

Stayed one night","We came to Salina for a concert and stayed at the Loft #2. The room was awesome and the place was very clean and well furnished. The loft is in the downtown area where there are quite a few restaurants, etc so you won't be lacking food options! We loved the place and if we ever find ourselves back in Salina we would definitely stay there again! The host is super responsive and had several suggestions for food (Martinelli's was outstanding). The only downside for some people would be the short climb up a set of stairs, not an issue for us but others might not be able to stay there because of that. Overall the place was 5 star! Thanks for hosting us, we had a wonderful time!"

Stayed a few nights","Pamela was a great host - very responsive, thought of small details to make our stay easy, helpful and available whenever we needed. The space was great for us having four bedrooms and a yard with a grill and fire pit worked wonderfully for our stay. Our standards might be higher than your average renter - it does feel like the property needs a deep clean and there are some small repairs that if completed, would bring my 4 star to a 5 star rating. Also, be aware that the hot water gets scalding within a short second of being turned on."

Group trip","This is a gem among Airbnbs! Pamela’s place was one the most spotless, comfortable, well equipped large airbnbs we’ve ever stayed at. It had ample gathering spaces, both indoors and out. Every room has small touches to help you feel at home. The bedrooms were large, the beds and linens were very comfortable, and each room was tastefully decorated. We slept great, and despite being in town for a sad reason, 100% enjoyed our time in her home. The home is also within walking distance of downtown Salina and has a front porch that just calls for you to stop and sit a spell. I honestly don’t think I can say enough good things about Pamela, or her place."

She is very responsive when questions are asked and we had ZERO problems. The beds were so comfy, the showers were amazing. She provided a whole binder of things to do in Salina, and everything that was within walking distance. She had so many things available that most people don't even think of bringing when they leave home. If i could give 10 stars I would. If I come back I am staying here again!!"

Stayed with kids","Our Salina stay was practically perfect in every way. Pamela keeps it classy in her spacious + meticulously CLEAN home. Every single thing was neat as a pin. Freshly renovated, the house blends modern amenity with sweet old house charms. Not one detail was overlooked as far as hospitality goes. Our family of 9 felt spoiled by all the included extras… and I heard she has a very special blessing who helps with this part. Plenty of popcorn, hot chocolate, coffee, and creamers but Pamela’s thoughtful generosity went far above that. She delivered ibuprofen within minutes of me expressing a need, then we were so touched by the gift of a personalized snack basket which catered to our son’s celiac disease. Oh, I almost forgot to add- Pamela found the purse I left behind and immediately shipped it home to me. If you find yourself in Salina… it doesn’t get any better than this.
All is Grace, Karrie"

Plenty of room for food, lots of different conversations and playing games. Our family was very impressed with the house and the all that came with it. Pamela was so kind and made check in quick and easy and sent us all the instructions. We so appreciate her hospitality. I would highly recommend staying here. You will not be disappointed!

Group trip","If you need space for a group this is it in Salina. Plenty of room for a group of 8.
This is an older house but you wouldn’t know it once you are in. Only cons are you must walk upstairs to the bedrooms and the 6:15am trash truck that picks up at the hotel down the street (Pamela can’t control that)
Now the good news- one of the best places we have ever stayed. For the price all guests get what they need- lots of towels, many chairs outside, grill, crock pot, excellent cooking supplies, big family room plus a coupe of tables inside to do what you need.
Pamela had a large selection of snacks ready plus numerous bottles of water and water filter pouring jugs (Salina tap water tastes different). Great stove and powerful microwave. Cooking supplies and a stocked pantry with aluminum foil and plastic bags. Plenty of parking on both sides of house. Keyless entry was easy. We didn’t use everything in the house but there are extra outdoor folding chairs, chairs on the porch, fire pit, plus outdoor table with six chairs. Location is great you can walk to restaurants, bars, a live theater (music and performing), plus downtown Salina businesses.
Pamela will communicate with you and replies back instantly if needed.
All in all a great stay. Thanks Pamela. Will stay again if in Salina."

Stayed over a week","Our stay with Pam was awesome. Check in was a breeze, the house was immaculate, and our stay went as smoothly as it possibly could have. The house is very well done and is incredibly cozy. During our stay the house stayed a comfortable temperature considering it was 100 degrees every day. Pam was so attentive and ready to jump on any issues that could come up. She also changed our sheets during our 3 week stay which was above and beyond for a ragged group of guys like us. If we're ever in Salina for an extended period of time again, Pam's house is going to be our first choice.
On top of the wonderful house and fantastic hospitality, the house is located in downtown Salina which is incredibly close to most restaurants and grocery stores.
Overall Pam has outdone herself and deserves every star we could possibly give her and I highly recommend staying at her property."

Excellent communication from Pam. Will definitely stay again if in the area!!

The pictures were amazing but the house didn't disappoint at all... Pamela has done an amazing job of setting the house up! The rooms were great and so is the outdoor space. Pamela was great to work with as well. I really appreciated that she checked in the first morning (well after we'd been in and out of the house) to make sure everything was going well.
We enjoyed the basket of snacks 😆 I also liked that both bathrooms had makeup remover wipes (as well as q-tips and cotton balls). That was a nice touch.
The location is great.. we were able to walk to a bar (Big Nose Kate.. it was fun and nice not to need a DD.) We didn't end up checking out nearby restaurants but we walked passed them and they were all busy.
If you're looking for a place in Salina I highly recommend this one."

All 4 bedrooms are upstairs giving you a nice open area downstairs to visit and eat! Loved our stay here. Top notch care!"

Group trip","Our stay at Pamelas house was great! We felt right at home and enjoyed having the space to spread out as opposed to a hotel! The location was just right for our activities planned while we stayed. It is walking distance to everything downtown and sits central in Salina for a quick drive anywhere. The house was very clean and has been updated and remodeled very nicely! The rooms were good sizes and the living spaces inside and outside were comfortable and spacious. Pamela thinks of everything to make sure guests at her house have what they need. Pamela was available and wonderful to talk to throughout the weekend, though we never needed anything, we enjoyed our conversations! We will plan to book this next year for our annual family reunion as soon as the dates set!"

Stayed with kids","Pam was available when we needed her, compassionate, and a joy to work with! When I had a need, she quickly responded and solved the issues. She took our needs and concerns seriously when they arose and we were completely happy with each resolution and her response. I appreciated that she returned our messages so quickly! We could tell from the moment we walked into the home that she takes extreme care of the house and has thought of everything, from safety measures (fire extinguishers, outdoor lighting, and alarms) to extra amenities (sewing kit, pool towels for Kenwood Cove or Kanopolis Lake, coffee bar, hampers and a cleaning station).
The house was beautiful! Well decorated and warm. It was so equipped and full of thoughtfulness. We did not find that we needed a single thing extra beyond what was provided. The kitchen was quite airy with plenty of space to host and cook, providing crock pots, birthday candles, bundt pans, and extra cooking supplies! We especially appreciated the option of plastic, ceramic, or glass kitchenware.
The games were a great touch and a hit with the kiddos!
There was plenty of room to spread out and relax and I felt like we didn't need a single thing! The backyard was cozy and well lit. We felt safe and comfortable spending time outside with our kids. Lots of places to sit and relax all over outside and inside!
We were completely happy with our stay! We felt welcome and as if we were treasured guests. Pam made our stay a joy and took the stress out of our vacation! We'd absolutely stay here again!"

Group trip","Pam as the host was great! She was very accessible and friendly. We had never been to Salina before and found the downtown Santa Fe Street completely charming. Lots of independent businesses such as art centers, restaurants, bakery, bars, and clothing shops. The street had been completely renovated with sculptures on every block, lush landscaping, horse drawn carriage, and stylish lighting, etc. So it was just fun going basically across the street to walk Santa Fe and look at everything. Pam's house was all freshly painted and all new flooring, furniture and furnishings. The art work was all original and had a sophisticated aesthetic to it all. Kitchen and bathrooms were all stocked and new with everything you could need. There was lots of craftsmanship put into the living room ceiling to make that entertaining room more interesting. The backyard was huge, quiet, and neatly kept. It just worked perfectly to have a small gathering for my fathers 80th birthday party with relatives coming from Hays, Manhattan, Dodge City, etc."

Group trip","Very spacious and well maintained home. Great back yard and deck for outside time. Very quiet neighborhood with friendly neighbors. Note that the kitchen is sparesly stocked. If you are planning on cooking meals while there, bring your own cookware and knives. We did have storms late both nights while staying in Salina and were disappointed to discover that the garage doors had been disabled preventing us from moving our cars into the garages to protect them. Also, please note most, if not all, of the beds are rollaway beds as is clearly mentioned in the description. They are pretty comfortable in spite of this and none of our party of 6 was uncomfortable sleeping on them. Also note, there is no coffee pot (again as in the description) only a Keurig, which was a disadvantage for our group who enjoys a leisurely AM of coffee and visiting. We would definitely recommend to others looking for a relaxing stay in Salina."

Bedroom was comfortable. Living room was very comfortable and large. Hosts provided water and glasses -- much appreciated. Easy to find, very convenient for my cross-country trip."

The location is in a family friendly area yet just minutes from hwy 70. Salina is a great place to stop while traveling across the Midwest. We get a kick out of the Rolling Hills Zoo. It boasts not only a zoo but it also has a large and fascinating diorama museum. It is literally real and simultaneously staged. My kids are convinced this is the place to film a sequel to the Night at the Museum movies.
Karla & David were kind & understanding about our late arrival. Even at that hour they invited our kids to go out and play on their outdoor tennis and basketball court. It was a perfect way for the kids to run off some pent-up-road-trip energy."

I can only hope that if I ever am I the neighborhood they’re not booked as I know I can not find anywhere on earth with better value for money. Again if you need somewhere to stay in Salina their place is perfect for up to 6 people comfortably. Do not miss the opportunity of staying in their beautiful house if you get the chance . .

It is in a perfect location-private and woodsy, but still close to plenty of parks, restaurants, shops, &t! Our host was so kind to provide some toys and snacks for our kiddos, which they thoroughly enjoyed. Their favorite part was the disk swing in the yard and the star night lights. As the mom, my favorite part was all the “little things” that made our trip easier- bottled water, high chair, fully stocked kitchen, laundry, and a lovely place to relax once the youngsters were in bed!"

Stayed with kids","A mile north of Salina proper, this nest in the trees is a proper get away! I was looking for a comfy place to crash a couple days and I was pleasantly surprised to find the much needed break from it all.
We were greeted by a dive into the trees and a winding drive that opened to an almost storybook meadow where our little weekend retreat sat gently atop a little hill. Inside was a basket of treats that would satisfy the health nut or the candy monster. The house was pleasant smelling, clean and welcoming.
All the amenities you could ever ask for to have a function temporary home were present, and then some.
My wife and I have been on the road with work for the better part of the last 20 years all of which has been spent in hotels, so I made some Airbnb faux pas, which Amber was both accommodating and patient. Going forward in my travels I’m definitely going to use Airbnb more and I will be staying here in particular, many more times in the future.
Best,

We knew we were coming on one of the hottest weekends of the year, but luckily her a/c worked even better than ours at home!!! Also, the shady yard provided a nice retreat from the heat and we loved her swing!!
Amber’s place was decorated very well, you can tell she’s put a lot of love and thought into the place and we were greeted with the BEST welcome package of local goods!
Amber is a great host. Very easy to get a hold of, but gives you space to enjoy your trip!"

We travel with our pack of pups which includes a senior dog. This place fit the bill for us and it was clean! You can tell Amber put a lot of love into this place. We would definitely stay again and highly recommend this private spot to relax in Salina.

The property was fun and funky with the jungle theme, but still felt like a country getaway. We had all we needed to cook, relax and catch up. If the weather would have been warmer, we would have loved to take advantage of the beautiful deck and fire area, but it was too cold! Amber was responsive and made sure our time was as pleasant as can be. We would definitely stay again!"

Amber paid so much attention to all the little details, and we truly felt so taken care of and pampered with all the little extra goodies. I loved the style and vibe of the place. The photos don't do this little Midnight Tropical Soiree any justice. This location is absolutely perfect for a romantic little getaway. Plus, it's just on the outside of town, so you feel secluded and yet it takes very little time to go ""into town"" to grab food and get back. We will be back sometime! If you're on the fence about it, just do it already! You won't regret it."

Including extra blankets for Odin (it was a chilly weekend for us Floridians), snacks, waters and a few other personalized welcoming gifts that made us feel right at home :)
The house was amazing and had even more character in person than what you can see in person. Though it’s not too far from a major road, it’s quiet enough to hear the leaves falling during the day and at night. There were a lot of little things there that must airbnbs forget; like extra spices, paper towels and plenty of kitchen utensils, which I really appreciated.
Highly recommend if you’re ever in the Salina area. It’s my new go-to for whenever I’m back in town
Thanks again Amber!!"

I couldn't imagine being cramped up in a hotel room with an option like this around. Amber is also a truly amazing host! The care and thought that she shows towards her guests is something you just don't get everywhere. Not only was she super flexible with my check in as I arrived pretty late at night, but she even left out a flashlight to help me navigate the property and an umbrella just in case it was raining when I got there. In short, Amber takes an already amazing stay and elevates it to a whole new level with her hospitality. I couldn't recommend this property enough!"

Stayed with kids","We enjoyed our time staying at this Air bnb. We appreciated the extra effort Amber went to for our daughter, like adding baby gates, plugs for the outlets, toys, blocks, rocking horse, and special animal cookies for her on a high chair. :) And we were provided fun snack baskets and pancake/waffle mix! That was so fun to walk in the door and see the snack baskets. I thought the lights around the deck were so fun, too. We enjoyed a lot of time out on the deck. There were goats that belonged to the neighbor that we got to see. That was fun for us and our daughter.
We appreciated the cold bottled water in the fridge. The midnight tropical theme was fun and creative, and it really felt like we were staying at a midnight tropical soiree because of the black curtains and black painted walls and mural on the walls. Amber's husband helped us get the fire pit started when we were having trouble. We had an enjoyable time at this air bnb.
It seemed like Amber wanted us to feel welcomed. We appreciated it! And her and her husband also gave us different ideas of what to do in the area and where to eat."

There were bathrobes in every bedroom and lots of extra blankets, pillow, and towels. There were night lights throughout the house that were dim until motion was detected, and then they brightened. The women appreciated the full length mirrors in their bedrooms. There were toys and games for both children and adults. We didn't get a chance to enjoy the backyard deck and grill, but they looked great. If we return to Salina we would definitely see if this place was available."

It is well appointed. Love all the towels and wash cloths. We were traveling with elderly parents and so when I reached out to Tracy to find out about what levels rooms and bathrooms were on, she was super helpful explaining the layout. The home is quaint and very well updated with all the amenities you need. The beds and pillows were great! The home is very spacious and you can separate into rooms and then come back together in the living/dining room. It is located on a lovely tree-lined street.
If the occasion presents itself, we would stay here again."

Stayed with kids","Check in was simple and easy, while we were unpacking we found a crushed twisted tea can inside a dresser drawer. After a day of traveling we wanted to take a shower and were met with a stand up tub that had no door only a shower curtain so showering was a bit difficult in such a small space, especially for larger individuals. The bathroom faucet was loose and sprays in all directions. When we attempted to open some blinds in the living room we found that the ends were scotch taped on having been broken before. The bathroom door and a bedroom door were very difficult to get to latch. Our 21 month child was sitting in the chair at the desk and it collapsed on him, which we then learned it was broken. We were left with only 2 trash bags and 1 roll of paper towels. Other than that Frank and Amy were very responsive and friendly and were very upset to learn of these things. I would most likely stay with them again, however not at this location."

My family and I did not feel comfortable staying due to the lack of cleanliness and visible mold. Overnight there were people outside breaking bottles and carrying on. My toddler was woke up many times. The bed linens were stained and smelled awful. There was so much dust my family’s allergies were awful. The property is very old and the photos don’t represent how dated it is. The bathroom was not clean. Especially the toilet. I cannot recommend this place - even though the hosts seem like very nice people.

Stayed one night","Location was great- easy to find and easy to get in. Beds were comfortable. Charming older home with beautiful wood & character. My only problem with the stay was cleanliness. Some prior guest had cooked in the microwave & there was food splattered all over inside & it stank. I wiped it down a bit because I needed to heat up something, but gross. Also there was some food drips on the stove. Also found it odd that guests are expected to start laundry."

The beds are two queens and a full across three bedrooms. Three TVs allowed everyone to relax and watch what they wanted. Hand washing the dishes was not ideal. The cleaning requirements were high but helped keep the price down so that the house was cheaper to rent than two hotels rooms.

We only had time for morning coffee but we could see it would be very easy and convenient to prepare meals for a longer stay. The living room’s cozy sitting space was great for our group of five. The beds and linens were comfortable and clean. We will definitely consider staying again

Group trip","Franks place looked exactly like the photos showed. It was extremely neat and clean. There were 7 of us there, he made an exception for us which was greatly appreciated, and there was plenty of room for us all to spread out. We were all able to eat at one table and be support for each other during our stay there (we came for a funeral for a small child) and times were stressful. It was our home away from home for a few days and we were able to invite the daddy of the little one to join us for dinner one night and gave laughter and relief for all involved. Frank went above and beyond for us. So much better than the best hotel where we would all be separated and have to eat each meal out. We would stay there again in a heart beat if we ever had to go back."

I was in town for a military ceremony. I had been having a hard time getting my shoes shined just right at home, and I knew a hair dryer would help (melts the shoe wax to help even out the shine), but ours at home was broken. I was really hoping they would have a hair dryer in the Bungalow when we got there and they did! It really saved me 😅
Overall it was a great experience. The kids had a great time and we were so happy that we found this place instead of a hotel. Thanks, Frank!"

Stayed one night","Great place to stay, loved having a drive way and a private back yard. Not shown in the pictures but there's a table and chairs out back if you want to sit outside.
Loved how easy the keypad check in was. There's a kpod-style coffee maker and pods and a nice fridge / stove. The bed was comfy and the TV is a roku tv that hooks up to wifi for Netflix and stuff.
Frank and Amy were very helpful; the wifi had gone out due to wind (very common in the midwest) and they let us know how to reset the router. They also worked with us on a flexible check out time which was extremely helpful for us so I appreciated that.
thank you for the great stay!"

The house is also close enough to the start/finish to walk. The house has about everything you need already supplied. The neighborhood is older but it was very quiet and didn’t experience any issues over our two night stay. I would definitely stay here again.

I'm one of those folks who seem to be addicted to pickleball, and a message on the Salina pickleball group's Facebook page got me set up with folks to play pickleball at Oakdale Park.

Traveling alone on business, I didn't need a king size bed or free breakfast; just a safe place to rest my head, and close proximity to the event center. Favorite bonus: The luggage rack in the bedroom! Small caveat: You might want to pack an eyemask and earplugs. It is a quiet neighborhood, but there's not much soundproofing between the units, so I could hear floorboards creaking on the other side. Not a big deal, especially if you plan ahead. :)"

We especially appreciated the use of the washer and dryer. Privacy is minimal, as the shared walls with the neighbors invite you to get to know one another more than in some duplexes, and there's no door between the bedroom/rest of the house, so noise travels easily through the space. Otherwise it was great, and we'll likely be back."

Heck in was easy and the hostess was super.
We were walking distance to a grocery store, great park and walking trail. Ken wood cove (awesome water park) was less than two miles away as well as Indian Rock Park (river with small waterfalls and trails)
We also hit the Rolling Hills Zoo which was excellent. About 15 minutes away."

The Hosts were very responsive, very nice and accommodating

We were also very pleased with the ease and response to any questions we had to Sharilyn. It was like working with a friend or family member. Would highly recommend this wonderful home.
