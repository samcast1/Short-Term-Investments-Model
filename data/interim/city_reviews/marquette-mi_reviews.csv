Stayed a few nights","This is a great house in a super location. Very quiet, nice big yard, lots of parking, easy to find, near the bike trails, near NMU, close to good restaurants.
The house was very, very clean; it was so nice.
Kasaim went above and beyond. A great welcome note with fresh, local muffins. He left non perishable food items; juice, pop, coffee and coffee maker and a fully stocked kitchen (pots/pans/dishes) for doing your own cooking, etc.
Kasaim communicated promptly and clearly.
I will definitely rent from Kasaim again. This is an excellent airbnb, and Kasaim is awesome."

Stayed with a pet","This was our second trip to Marquette, and after such a comfortable and welcoming stay, we are convinced this is our go to airbnb for future vacation. Kasaim’s place was impeccably clean and even had a warm welcome note with some breakfast pastries. He was incredibly thoughtful checking in even on our first night. This airbnb is a great location and we found it incredibly easy to pop down to third street in only 5 minutes and make it over to great hikes like sugar loaf in under 10 minutes. I highly recommend staying here."

Stayed a few nights","Kasaim’s house was perfect for our weekend in Marquette. We like to travel with our small dogs whenever possible but it’s always a challenge finding a place that’s private/not an apartment. Kasaim’s place was a gem as it was a full house with a lovely yard for them to play.
Kasaim offered many thoughtful amenities, including a box of pastries from a local bakery, a new sleeve of bagels with cream cheese and butter, orange juice, Coke and a frozen pizza to name some. He also provided a thorough guide book (on airbnb) of local recommendations for restaurants which we utilized the whole weekend.
There were plenty of towels and toiletries and an extra blanket for the bed. The shower got very hot and the water pressure was excellent.
Tv was well positioned for everyone and it was a smart Roku tv so you can sign into your streaming services.
Overall, I would rank Kasaim’s place higher than 5 stars if I could! Would definitely would stay again.
Thank you Kasaim!!!"

Stayed a few nights","Stayed for our wedding anniversary and my birthday.
Super cute little house.
Before we arrived we were messaged instructions to receive keys.
Once we were in the house, we noticed a little little snack from a local bakery. Super awesome touch. Host was very helpful. Even messaged us to make sure everything was going well.
Bathroom is very spacious and the towel folding is next level.
Kitchen was very clean and well organized. With everything we needed for our stay.
The living room had a cool coffee table, and reclining couch.
Smart TV has a few streaming services logged in which is always nice.
The bedrooms were a bit on the small side. But let's be realistic, you don't get a airbnb to sit in the bedroom.
Washer and dryer is a huge plus to get us cleaned and organized for our return trip.
If I were to change anything about this visit, it would be the beds themselves. Be aware they are very very firm. The firmness of the beds would be my only deterant from booking again."

Stayed with a pet","We drove up to a well-cared for place, on a quiet street, just three blocks from beach access. There is a new back porch and steps, leading into the kitchen. The living room has a nice arrangement for hanging out. Right away we noticed the bakery items Kasaim had left for us, along with a note essentially telling us to make ourselves at home. Kasaim had fire escape plans in the bedrooms, along with the address of this place and emergency number, should something catastrophic happen... it's been a while since we've seen experienced such a conscientious and generous host.
We highly recommend this place and will consider re-booking it, should we decide to vacation in Marquette. The town is bike friendly, with a trail running for miles along the lake. We liked being just three short blocks from a trail head. We have e-bikes and pull a BooYah, for our dog to ride in, so are seriously considering going back again some day."

Stayed a few nights","We had a great 4-night stay in Kasaim’s place. This is what AirBnB is all about, in my opinion: the place is nothing *fancy* and it doesn’t have the same, carbon copied “AirBnB decor” that you see in 80% of listings. Instead, it’s cozy, functional, and thoughtfully and generously equipped by Kasaim (can you say fresh bakery muffins!?), plus we weren’t expected to do more than drop dirty linens in the hamper on our way out. We loved being able to ride right to the North trails, downtown, beaches, and Preque Isle. (The south trails were within riding distance too, but we chose to drive so we could have our car with provisions, beach stuff, etc.) We will definitely look to stay here again next time we’re in Marquette!"

Great location
Very clean, good beds & great shower water pressure.
Big backyard for our “kids”…we even had a doe & her 3 fawns run through the yard. Good places to walk to the left & right of us for our “kids”.
Great touch with muffins from local bakery & coffee for our stay.
We will certainly want to return on our next visit to Marquette.
Thank you

Stayed with a pet","Place is exactly as pictured and described, but what is not described is how great a host Kasaim is. Communication was timely and informative, but what really stood out was the small extras Kasaim did to make the space so much more welcoming. In my private note to him, I mentioned this was one of the best airbnb's we have ever stayed. My wife's quote ""why cant all airbnbs be as nice as this."" Location was perfect, house was perfect for my wife, our dog, and myself. Quiet street, big back yard with outdoor activities. Would highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone looking to enjoy Marquette. Will definitely be back!"

We thoroughly enjoyed everything this place has to offer and we would definitely come back!

It is in downtown Marquette in a perfect location within walking distance to everything and a view of the water and ore dock from the deck. The condo itself is extremely well stocked, you could probably cook anything you could think of in the kitchen and have all the necessary kitchen wares and utensils. The towels and sheets were great quality and enough for our group of 4 adults and one baby. The beds were very comfortable and the rooms were a good size. Having a washer and dryer was a huge convenience. We always bring our own detergents, but Anne had some in supply if we hadn't brought our own. The living room area was spacious and comfortable, but we spent most of our time out on the deck to enjoy the great view and wonderful weather. I can't say enough about how much we enjoyed our stay.

Anne and Allyssa were excellent communicators and were very quick to help navigate the somewhat confusing parking situation. (Remember folks— you are staying in a rapidly growing downtown! Be a little forgiving on having to walk 1.5 blocks for free parking or paying less than $5/day for a meter right out front!)
One tip: if you need to use both bedrooms, bring a sleep mask. The lights on the public walkway right outside the second bedroom are very bright."

Anne’s condo has everything you need - location, cleanliness, well equipped kitchen and bath. Bonus is TV with different popular streaming services. There are so many shops and restaurants within walking distance.
We had questions about the parking and how to work the TV system and Anne was quick to respond.

(My only suggestions were minor and she seemed keen to implement them, so I won't mention them here.) I would definitely stay here again and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it."

It was kind of a pain washing dishes by hand (there is no dishwasher), especially as we ate almost all of our meals at home, and this took up a lot of time I would have otherwise liked to have used doing other things while on vacation. This was of course known to us ahead of time, so it's not a complaint, just something that stood out about our stay."

My favorites-swimming in Lake Superior (60 degrees), Macinac Island, Copper Harbor, hiking at Mosquito trails, glass bottom shipwreck tour, sunset cruise, Marquette town, 3 museums, and a mining tour. And we saw the Northern Lights one evening from the beach! Our stay was 8 days long and I look forward to coming back to this wonderful, serene place. On my bucket list is Isle Royale. We had 4 adults and the cottage was the perfect size. We enjoyed the fire pit almost every evening. Five star review."

Casandra’s place is absolutely gorgeous and she added so many little details (including a pack n play, a rail on the bed, kids’ wash + bath toys + spout cover and rinse in the tub, toys and books in the kids’ room, etc) to make us feel right at home. I really cannot say enough to capture how beautiful this place is and how wonderful it was for our family. It is also located steps from a beautiful private beach, 6 minutes from the Lakenenland sculpture park, a 15-minute drive from downtown Marquette, and a short drive to lots of beautiful hiking spots, beaches, etc. We loved the location! Casandra was super communicative and responsive from before we ever started the trip, offering great suggestions for things to do with the kids while there, and she even reached out a few times during our stay to inform us of events happening in town. Thank you! We hope to return soon!"

Very thoughtful of the host to provide kids toys and other kids essentials. Didn’t like the exterior of the house or the fitpit, an old run down house is renovated inside, since its unimpressive on the outside maybe that’s why host didn’t post the outside pics.

Literally steps away from a private beach on Lake Superior to visit anytime. We went down to the beach a few times each day and loved it.

We were in town for the UP200, and when we found out the course runs across the street and the Midnight Run ended at the casino, we definitely got lucky on our location!
The cottage is beautifully decorated and cozy! It felt like a home away from home! Plenty of dishes and spices to cook in the kitchen. Bathroom was stocked and clean. We can't wait to stay again during another season!
Casandra was very communicative leading up to and during the stay. They helped clear the driveway and sidewalk of newly fallen snow, and she gave us the hints of where to best view the dog sled teams out on the courses!
We stayed as 4 adults, and no one minded the twin beds in the second room. The family room offered plenty of space to play games and socialize, while the kitchen had plenty of storage for snacks and drinks.
My favorite moment in the cottage was being able to make a fresh mug of coffee, read a book in the kitchen seating nook, and relax while fresh snow was fell outside.
If you want to truly relax in a tranquil environment, this is the stay for you!"

Stayed with kids","This might be our favorite Airbnb of all time. It was absolutely perfect for our family of 4. If we could give it more than 5 stars, we would. The cozy cabin is located just steps from a private, sandy Lake Superior beach that you access by walking through the hosts' backyard. The hosts are extremely available, super responsive, yet also very willing to give the guests privacy, so it doesn't feel like you're intruding by using the beach at all.
Highlights:
-The cabin was impeccably clean.
-It was VERY recently remodeled. Features include an absolutely gorgeous bathroom and kitchen, so much so that we were taking notes on the fixtures used for our own upcoming bathroom remodel.
-The beds were incredibly comfy, maybe the most comfortable we've ever experienced outside our own home.
-The Lake Superior beach is glorious. Perfect clean sand, gradual water depth, and just steps away. There's even a hose to use to spray off your feet before you walk back to the cabin!
-The location is amazing. Just 10 minutes from Marquette, and 30 minutes from Munising.
The only downside I can think of (and this is a stretch), is that the eat-in kitchen only has a table for 2 and there is no dishwasher. It's a small cabin, and the space they have is used VERY efficiently, but it's still small.
We hope to stay here again in the future, and will definitely be recommending it to our friends and family. Thank you so much for your hospitality, Casandra!"

It was perfect for my husband and I, we used the second bedroom for our open suitcases but there is great closet space and great touches if you have kids in the second room. The bathroom was great, counter space and a nice shower. It felt great to have a nice place to shower after all the hiking we did. She also had so many nice touches, like several comfy blankets, a chocolate bar for us and comfy furniture. It's clear a lot of thought went into everything at this little cottage. I wished I could have stayed longer! There isn't a dishwasher or washer/dryer if that's important to you but we didn't need either so it was fine for us. It's a bit outside of town but an easy drive into town. Cassandra also drove by and gave us a few details and checked to see if we needed anything (from a good social distance) and was quick to respond to messages and checked in with us. Very much recommend this place!"

The cabin is fully outfitted with everything you can think of - the small things like paper towel and a welcome gift and extra blankets and comfy towels and excellent dishes and sharp knives!

For context on our review and recommendation, we were longtime Marquette residents reuniting in our hometown for a holiday weekend. It was so lovely to stay outside of the ""town proper"" for a change of scenery. She and Dave are fantastic hosts, immensely warm and welcoming. Their location and property are great, with Lake Superior just up the driveway and around the front of the main house. It's a quick jaunt into town, with an equally easy drive to Au Train, Pictured Rocks, etc. Also love that you can pick up Iron Ore Heritage Trail nearby too, though I didn't take advantage this trip. Overall, highly recommend this spot for anyone visiting the area and looking cover a good amount of ground in various directions, while also enjoying beautiful lakefront life. It was a great homebase for us. Already starting to mull over when I can schedule another trip!"

Stayed with kids","Are you a little tired of dated accommodations or slightly weird decor? Stay HERE instead. Clean lines and tasteful touches, but still super kid-friendly. About 10 mins to Marquette by car and right across the road from the bike path. We biked into Marquette with kids—age 8 (on his own bike) and 16 mo (in Burley) in less than 90 mins. Flat and easy ride for us non-bikers.
Walking down to the lake is just a quick couple minutes. Water was high and reminded me of Duluth.
Casandra was very available and gave lots of good suggestions, yet she was totally respectful of our privacy. Highly recommend!"

The cute little kitchen booth was great for dining, and the home was just as pictured, and quite perfect!
The bed and linens were SO comfortable!
Cassie greeted us on our arrival, but gave us the choice of getting settled in first, always respectful of our privacy. We opted to have her meet us at the door, and we are glad she did, as she was full of good tips on where to explore Marquette hiking and restaurants/breweries.
On our way out we walked down the driveway to Lake Superior to experience the gales of November. It was amazing. Great location, great home, great hosts. We will be back!"

Everything you could possibly need was included in this studio apartment. The bed was very comfy, the shower was lovely, and there is even a little sitting area off the bathroom with great lighting for wedding prep make-up. 😊. But the grandkids in our party will argue that the best feature was the secret passageway connecting their hallway to Mimi and Pappy's space!! (No worries...this was unlocked by the host at our request). Thanks, Wendy, for a wonderful stay!"

We comfortably slept two - one on the bed and one on the couch in the back room. The television in the main room had several streaming services, along with board games to fill in the open time between activities. Directions for the stay, as well as info about the apartment and surrounding areas made things rather easy for us.
Concerning location, the apartment is very close to downtown Marquette. We were able to walk down to the shops and restaurants and it was a relief not having to worry about a car.
It was an overall excellent experience! Wendy is a great host and was quick to answer any questions that came up. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this place to anyone looking for a good value and great location for lodgings in Marquette."

Stayed a few nights","Great little studio apartment that’s close to the Downtown Marquette area. Had the weather been a bit warmer, and the eateries / brewery able to seat customers (currently carry out only due to the state pandemic restrictions) the apartment would be a quick walk down the street.
There’s a main bedroom and a smaller sitting room area that looks like it could be an extra bed (by the bathroom.)
The main space includes a fridge, microwave, small stove, and pots, pans, glasses, dishware/utensils and even a few simple spices. There are also some games, which we did not use.
The owners are environmentally conscious and ask that people recycle, and they had big bins outside which made that easy to do.
Special touches include: the heated tile floor in the bathroom (!!!), a remote controlled lighted ceiling fan, a small “Alexa”, a white noise sound machine (which we didn’t need to use) and a smart TV including Sling, Netflix and Roku, etc. access as well as an outdoor deck area with a table, chairs and fire pit which they lit up for us.
The hosts, Wendy and David, were quick to respond to questions and friendly.
We hope to visit again!"

Furthermore, our host was very responsive and recommended places near to the property that were just great. They've really gone above and beyond to make this place feel like a home. There's even a grill and some chairs to use outside where we hung out and grilled steaks overlooking Marquette's skyline. As a photographer, I was excited to be a few steps away from photo opportunities. The people of Marquette are a fun bunch who you'll feel like you've known for years. Our host was a great ambassador to those folks. Two thumbs way up."

They are super responsive, have concise and clear instructions, excellent recommendations, and are as friendly as you could hope for. The view of Lake Superior is both gorgeous and (when the wind is whipping) terrifying. The wood burning stove is a game changer - don’t wait for your third time to try it out like I did.
Overall, exactly what I wanted out of my stay, and I hope to be back a fourth time."

For him, it was a hunting trip. For me, Point of the Point, was my perfect version of absolute zen. The home is gorgeous, obviously loved and cared for, with views that make you praise God!
I went on several day hikes. Pictured Rocks, Presque Isle Park, Miner’s Falls that were all spectacular. I was so fortunate with the weather. I did however, stay in bed for 16 hours on one of my days. My body was grateful!
Emily and Cole were wonderful hosts and I can’t thank them enough for allowing me to melt away all the stress and worry at their peaceful, beautiful home."

The house is an attraction all by itself. Such cool architecture, interesting design ideas, and the coziest wood burning stove that heats the whole house quickly. It was also the cleanest AirBNB we've ever stayed in -- and we've stayed in many.
We absolutely loved Marquette, and spent most days dividing our time between exploring the city and relaxing in the warm, cozy cabin. We highly recommend this as a U.P. destination, and hope to come back with our family in the future!"

Whether it was sitting on chairs at the lakes edge, taking a dip in the cool waters, or sitting inside and just gazing out the huge windows, being here brought us such peace and relaxation. We had planned to enjoy active days and dinner in Munising before returning to the cabin but each morning we found ourselves staying as long as we could before heading out to explore (for us it was mostly Pictured Rocks), then picking up groceries or take out and racing back to the cabin in time to enjoy as much daylight as possible before enjoying a comfortable and restful sleep. We honestly cannot wait to return, thank you for sharing your little slice of paradise with us!"

Stayed with kids","Beautiful, unique, and clean house with gorgeous Lake Superior outside the window. Great home base to explore Marquette and Pictured Rocks in Munising. It's probably because we are more city people, but unfortunately we could not enjoy the backyard due to mosquito swarms. Emily and Cole provided spray and a swatter. Even with that, we felt the need to run like fools from the car to the house. Maybe it's just bad in June and other months are less mosquito'd? Either way, warning to those who aren't used to the woods to be prepared for a lot of activity from flying parasites."

Stayed a few nights","Point of the Point is beyond sublime. We had special guests from abroad, and this unique and well-maintained home was the perfect spot to have them experience the beauty and power of Lake Superior.
This house will have everything you need for a rustic yet plush stay; a well equipped kitchen, spacious living space, fire pit and swimming hole outside beyond the back porch and even an Apple TV.
Cole and Emily were also very responsive to our various questions and needs, and their friendliness elevated this experience which greatly surpassed our expectations. If you are in or around Marquette, PotP is the place for you."

Stayed a few nights","We spent a blessed two nights in Emily and Cole's place and wish it could have been a LOT longer. Definitely the nicest place we stayed while in the UP. We felt at home the minute we walked in and saw the aesthetic decor, stunning view, and the yummy bottle of wine and chocolate they had left for us. I had the best nights' sleep I've had in years and then enjoyed our morning coffee sitting on the rocks out front soaking in the view. The beds were comfy, the kitchen well-stocked, and the house manual had loads of really helpful information. Also loved reading the article about the construction of this house that's hanging on the wall. REALLY hope to stay here again someday. Thank you Emily and Cole!"

There were notes of instructions and tips for everything throughout the house. The space looks just like the pictures, architecturally jaw dropping. (Awesome for photo opportunities). Windows and the view make this place worth the drive.
The place was spotless. I’m picky about bedding and slept like a baby in those sheets. They had everything we needed to make all of our meals, and I was able to WFH here.
It is literally one of the best Airbnbs I’ve ever booked, and it made our trip so much more enjoyable and memorable!

As many have said, the house is extremely clean. The shampoos and soaps smell wonderful, and the beds are comfortable. I would love to come back to this home with other adult friends, or when our kids are a little older. We do have a toddler, and because the home is so well-kept and lovely, I did have a lot of stress about her not making a mess of anything. It is definitely better suited to families whose children are able to navigate steps and sharp corners! Our older girls absolutely loved going out onto the rocks for sunset, and enjoying popsicles in the yard. Many wonderful memories in a corner of the world we have never been before!!"

The house has unique architecture, but it is also comfortable and inviting.Cole and Emily keep their house very clean, which was super important to me. To me, the main magic was the view from the front window in the morning and the cozy fire in the wood stove at night. We love and know the UP pretty well, so cross country skiing and hiking to ice caves was a great delight for us. We highly recommend this place, if you will be lucky to find an open date :)"

Group trip","All I can say is this couple knows how to do an Airbnb! First off, it was immaculate! Cleanest place I’ve been to. They also thought of everything you could possibly need, like fans, games, soap/shampoo and the list goes on! I also appreciated that the place wasn’t cluttered. I hate when every table, bookcase, cabinet is stuffed or full of things. This allowed us to settle our own things in, have room to plug in cell phones and put our needed items away. I loved that everything was well maintained and in good working order. They definitely give this home the attention it needs to keep it running smoothly. To help those determining if this place would work for activities with any kind of gear, don’t worry! There is a big sitting/mud room as soon as you enter the house. We did some hiking and ice climbing, and storing our gear was no problem. We appreciate this sweet couple for sharing such a special place with all of us. The views in every direction were breathtaking! Communication was also spot on! Thanks again Cole and Emily! We WILL be back!"

The property is so unique in and of itself, but staying here actually made us amend all of our plans because we genuinely wanted more time at the cabin. The wood stove is such an amazing amenity in the winter.
As an added bonus, the beds are insanely comfortable, the house is SO clean, and the bits of history of the home really make it even better. Plus Emily was stellar to communicate with. We really needed this vacation and staying here was honestly the best part. Thank you so much Cole and Emily, we loved it here more than we can say."

We sat in our camp chairs on the rocks by the lake in the evening and star gazed.

We had several warm days but were able to keep things cool inside with fans to direct the breeze. Wifi was helpful to keep me connected to work when needed. The kitchen was easy to navigate and supplied with appliances to prepare our own meals, but Marquette is a very short drive away for dinners out.

Quiet location, really didn't notice the store downstairs or the other upstairs apartment. Roomy enough for the two of us, tastefully decorated, basics of what you need in a kitchen are provided if you want to cook. Provided paper towel and dish washing supplies, would need to bring your own storage stuff like variety of storage bags or containers, also things like tinfoil or saranwrap. Plenty of good places to eat in Marquette though if you don't plan to cook! Shower was really nice, great lighting in the bathroom by the mirror, very appreciated. Bed was comfortable as was living room furniture. No closet in the bedroom, but an overdoor hook thing they had did the trick. If you have a lot to hang, bring hangers to maximize the space. Hosts are very responsive to questions, very friendly. We hope to come back someday!"

Stayed a few nights","We’ve been to Marquette a few times but never able to stay Downtown before. Coming in the off-season was great, and the location was super convenient to just be able to walk everywhere. The kitchen was really clean and they had pans/pots/spices that unfortunately we only used twice since there was so many good restaurants around lol. The mud room was a good inbetween, we went hiking a few times and it was super convenient to be able to take off our shoes/coats in there. The space was very clear and tidy and easy to navigate. The offroad parking space was also super convenient since we were right at the foot of the staircase and able to bring our bags up super easily.
Thanks again!"

Also, the location of the apartment is great, cause you can walk everywhere and there are many good restaurants and bars nearby. You can also see a bit of the lake from the window. We had a wonderful stay there. Highly recommended! :)"

Stayed a few nights","We really liked the location of this place close to everything we wanted to do like shopping at Getz’s and going to breweries and restaurants. The only driving we had to do was to go for the trail we wanted to hike north of the city. It was efficient and clean. We enjoyed having coffee and watching the sunrise in the heated entrance area. It was nice to have a free parking spot, as everywhere around us was pay to park. Luckily, there was not a lot of snow or ice which could have made the steps up a bit difficult. It was more quiet than I thought it would be except for the first night when the city workers were scraping and hauling snow from the street at 3:30 a.m., but that was out of the hands of the host. I would recommend this place for a couple looking for a get away."

The location was right in the middle of downtown within walking distance of everything. The apartment was adorable, exactly as pictured and was super clean! The late night and early morning noise was a bit loud from in the bedroom, but nothing a light sleeper couldn’t sleep through. It did feel a bit expensive for the small amount of space, but everything in the area is priced relatively the same. Not to mention, the location is priceless. Highly recommend Ore Dock Brewery and Black River Coffee, we went to each every single day! It was truly a great stay, highly recommend. We hope to be back next year!"

Our favorite part was the little porch that we fully took advantage of when we had a perfect sunny 75-degree day! The rental was spotless and we were so very comfortable, definitely hard to leave that little piece of paradise this morning. We will definitely be back! And a very helpful, responsive host too!"

The flat itself was warm and inviting, the perfect place to wind down after seeing a gig or drink at the Ore Brewery (it’s across the road!!).

I think a couple reviewers mentioned this, but the building is on a busy street, so in the mornings you will hear cars zooming by, but that didn't bother us. Debora was a great host, and shared so many wonderful recommendations with us."

Stayed a few nights","Unfortunately, because of flight delays, I was not actually able to be part of the reservation in person. I was apprehensive that it would be difficult for the two other guests whom I was supposed to meet there to check in and get all of the necessary information, since the reservation had been made under my account, but it turned out not to be an issue. Debora provided clear and comprehensive written instructions that I was simply able to screenshot and pass along to the other guests, and they seemed to have no trouble with any of the details.
They noted that the available parking was nearby and easy to find and that the apartment itself was comfortable, interesting, and had a homey feeling. They praised the color scheme and the quality of the furnishings. The ambient temperature , water pressure, natural lighting, and view of the lake were all great. Although it stormed during the stay, they found it pleasant to watch over the lake. The only complaint was that I wasn't also there!"

There are coffee shops (Dead River and MQT Provisions are super close and good) , restaurants, breweries, and shops galore all within walking distance. If you like live music ( or just good beer and good company) check out Ore Dock Brewing co. Check their FB page to see if they have a band while you're there! The Vierling and Iron Bay Restaurant were also great. We rented bikes from MQT Bike Rental to bike the multi-use path. I said this two years ago, and I will say again that this is my favorite vacation rental ( of many) that we have stayed at."

The mid-century vibe is pretty awesome - no detail has been spared in furnishings, fixtures or decor. We weren't inside much because we spent most of our time exploring Marquette and surroundings, but I can imagine it being a comfortable and fun place to hang out during inclement weather. Lots of old-school board games and records to enjoy. We enjoyed being steps away from the lake, a short walking distance from downtown and the marina, and minutes from some of the better food and beer options in Marquette. This was our first visit to Marquette, but we'll definitely be back and I'd absolutely stay here again if availability allows."

We stayed in one night and made dinner there because we knew this place was special and wanted to take it all in. Location was perfect and within walking distance to everything. Had a great time and we will be back!

Deb stocked the place with fantastic local coffee, unscented linens (AMAZING and so hard to find in AirBnBs), and a record collection where anyone could find something enjoyable to listen to.

Stayed a few nights","We really enjoyed our stay and loved the space but could easily be fixed for a more pleasurable experience with a pretty low investment.
Pros: the space is much larger than it looks in pictures, location is fantastic, Debs communication was clear, quick, and concise, enough linens to last a year, sound system
Cons: the shower curtain needs replaced as it is covered in mildew, the bathroom is not level(jokes that it was the 2nd mystery spot), the kitchen is literally only stocked with salt and pepper(no sugar, flour, or seasonings of any kind), no TVs in either bedroom, king mattress is on a box spring on the floor, a ton of records(looks like mostly freebies from goodwill).
Overall: this space is ideal and perfect for a single night or two stay. With a pretty low investment it would greatly improve the overall experience guests may have. I would stay again, but only on a quick trip."

Watch a few episodes of Mad Men to get in the mood and prepare yourself for a step back in time, both in the apartment and with in the small town charm of Marquette. Relax with a beer from Ore Dock after a meal at Iron Bay — both just a short jaunt away. Just know it’s on a busy street, but everyone driving by is missing out on the experience you get to have in this beguiling spot."

The location is also right downtown and in easy walking distance to coffee shops, bakeries, restaurants, bars, parks, and Lake Superior. Marquette offers so much to do, indoors and out and Debora's place is the perfect spot to stay while enjoying the area."

Stayed a few nights","Deb's place is cute and clean. The decor brought back many memories from my childhood. If you're looking for the comfort of modern cushy furniture, this is not the place for you. MCM furniture isn't terrible comfortable. But the bed was amazing!!! And watching the sun rise over Lake Superior from my bed was spectacular. I had trouble holding a streaming service on the TV - I assume it was a Wi-Fi strength issue - but I was able to connect my devices without a problem. It's also located on a pretty busy street so if you're a light sleeper, you could find it noisy. However, it didn't bother me. I thought it was a great value. She doesn't charge what she probably could based upon other rentals in the area."

Debora has incredible taste and her attention to detail is not to be missed. From the minute we arrived, we were in awe. Her communication, the cleanliness of the place and the perfect location made for an unforgettable couple of days. Every time I walked into a room, I noticed something else more magical than the last. As soon as you step foot into this place it’s like you enter another time period. The pictures don’t do it justice! Do yourself a favor and stay here. I guarantee you will not be disappointed!"

Quiet (okay, the old wooden stairs leading up would challenge even a ninja to be undetected), clean and well stocked linen closet. Pay attention to her instructions on how to work the shower. It is fine, just not one I was used to so glad she explains it in the check in instructions. She is a great host, flexible and good communicator. Hope to stay again in the future."

Debora’s apartment was the absolute best place for a four night getaway before diving back into a crazy year of teaching.

Debora gave lots of wonderful suggestions of places to go, and went out of her way to help accommodate us on our trip. I can’t wait to go back to her little retro hideaway!"

The apartment is located close enough to walk to many things and Debora makes an effort to explain things very well and thoroughly which we appreciated.
