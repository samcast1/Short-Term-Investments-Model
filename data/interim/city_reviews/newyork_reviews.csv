I traveled alone and had space for one, but would have harder for more than two people. Do bring staples.. Plenty of places around to pick up what you forgot though ! Be prepared for a drip coffee maker! Overall great experience!"

Stayed about a week","Excellent location. The ground floor of a block of flats, and quiet, other than when people enter or exit the building. The space is small; one bedroom, partitioned by sliding doors. So, felt more like a studio. It was ok for the 2 of us, we were mainly out; could be tricky for 4.
There were a few surprises. The location is not on Gansevoort as listed but on Horatio, nearby. Communication (excellent) was via a colleague of the listed host,
and not via Airbnb.
The space was cosy and clean, however, exceptionally hot. The radiator in the bedroom was noisy and made sleeping difficult. There is no temperature control; it's central in the building. Opening a window did not feel secure.
The kitchen was well-equipped, but there were no tables or chairs. Also, in our view, some maintenance is required. eg loose shower tiles flagged previously, but not addressed.
We were offered a late checkout, in exchange for a five * review; we declined."

Stayed one night","1. Communication is fast. I left the shampoo after leaving the room due to my negligence. The host tried to return the shampoo from the cleaner, allowed us to enter the building again, and helped us find it for free on day 3 after leaving.
2. The location of the accommodation is really good. I felt safe.
3. It was clean and the accommodation was really pretty organized.
4. I don't think I personally knew how to use the heating controller. I thought the problem was that a small radiator could cover the whole room, but I think I was mistaken. In personal experience, I didn't sleep well because the room was really cold because I didn't know how to use the heating controller. We have been confirmed that the host will take action on this matter. So the next guest doesn't have to worry too much."

Stayed with kids",Excellent location! Tiny New York style apartment in the best location. This place is perfect for 2 people. Any more than that will feel very tight. Host is very nice and responsive. Apartment was nice but it needs some upgrades. The tile in the bathroom is cracked/broken and I almost cut my foot while taking a shower. The drain also clogs every time you use it. Another issue is the AC unit which needs to be properly sealed to keep the cold air from coming in. Our room was freezing at night.

Great shower, everything you need in the kitchen , quiet refrigerator, very good bed, and bed linens. It is also quiet in the apartment, and that is exceptional for the city. It is very easy to connect with the host, answered within a short time if we had any questions. The instructions were clear and to the point. We had a very nice stay!"

Stayed one night","What a beautiful apartment! It was so nice to live like a New Yorker for a week. Close to several subways and just blocks from the west side highway if you need to travel by car. Free street parking if you have the patience to search for a spot (if not, use SpotAngels or SpotHero apps to find a garage).
Great alternative to hotel life, with everything you could need. Kitchen was newly updated and spacious for cooking. Just as pictured and very clean. Cassidy was a wonderful host."

She also kindly let us store our bags after checkout so we could have lunch before leaving for the airport. A lovely visit!

Cassidy went beyond and above to help us get situated and was even checking in from time to time make sure we were comfortable and happy with her place. The location in the West Village is amazing. No cheesy hotels, just beautiful streets and amazing restaurants. Dream neighborhood.
We actually left our Midtown hotel to come stay at this apartment and never regretted it for a second. The apartment itself is basically brand new. Super clean. Bedroom with sliding doors to a cozy sofa and kitchen area. Super cooling air conditioner.
Perfect location. Helpful hostess. Thanks so much!"

Stayed a few nights","I recently had the pleasure of staying at this fantastic Airbnb in Manhattan, and I can't recommend it highly enough. The apartment is incredibly spacious, offering plenty of room to relax after a busy day in the city. The price is very reasonable, especially considering the prime location.
Situated close to Times Square, Central Park, and the metro, this Airbnb is perfect for anyone looking to explore the heart of New York City. The convenience of having these iconic destinations just a short walk or subway ride away made our stay even more enjoyable.
Additionally, the place was spotless. The cleanliness of the apartment was impressive, adding to the overall comfort and experience. If you're looking for a great place to stay in Manhattan that offers both space and an unbeatable location, this is it!"

Stayed about a week","Cool hotel. Don't miss the Saturday morning piano concerts with Kris Hull. But the hotel is a little unclear on a couple concepts, like they claim ""breakfast"" is served in the morning, but there is a ""one pastry limit"" at the counter, which isn't exactly breakfast. And their rooftop ""bar"" has a host station where you have to wait to be seated... which again is not exactly how a bar works. But the vibe is otherwise good and oh yeah hotel rooms should have coffee makers in them."

Stayed about a week",My son had been there for over a month and they kept raising their prices which is strange because the longer you stay the creeper it always gets I've never had an Airbnb keep raising their prices ! Not only that but not only my son but alot of other people staying there complained that their service was rude and never greeted nor welcomed the guests! In fact the whole time they didn't give a welcoming nature you think they would since it is customer drive! I dealt online customer ok mer service and they seemed pretty nice and helpful don't expect that with the actual workers

The rooms have a very smart and functional design. The beds are very comfortable. Everything very clean and the staff very attentive. The air conditioner in the room works and is very well regulated to your liking.
Included breakfasts give you the strength to kick the city. Very nice coffee and delicious cakes.
The common spaces are very pleasant and make you enjoy your stay when you return after a long day.
Highly recommend if you're traveling with or without family. I'd definitely come back."

Get up from good to have a choice about pastries
Very weak electric current
No toilet brush

Stayed a few nights","I loved my stay here, the building is funky, the staff were welcoming, but the location was perfect for us. We walked to most of the city's main attractions or we caught the subway which was close by. There are countless restaurants and bars in the area.
The room is tiny (because, New York right?) but really well designed and has everything you need. I would definitely recommend this place for New York visitors."

Stayed over a week","Book without fear! You will have a pleasant stay in a place full of art. The breakfast is a delicious differential. Arrive early to choose two delicious options between the cakes, puffs and baked goods, offered on the day. In addition, LES is an amazing area to stay and deserves to be explored. You can still find a piano performance over breakfast! Attention to the size of the room: very compact and no wardrobe. There is a cabinet with utilities on each floor: microwave, iron and ironing board, water cooler to fill the water bottle in your bedroom, towels and extra coffee capsules. On some floors there is also a scale, which helped a lot in the control of the weight of the suitcase. Ah! The room has a coffee machine and a micro figrobar. Soft bed and pillows. Nearby: Economy Candy, Congee Sum House, Nolita Pizza, El Castillo de Jagua, Don Ceviche in Essex Marcket, Krave Deli. Recommended! :-D"

There's a Whole Foods market nearby and a great pub on Bleecker Street (Bleecker Street Bar), also nearby. We love everything, the hotel has a lot of personality and although the rooms are small, they have absolutely everything you need! Comfortable bed, great shower, lots of hangers, space under the bed to put the suitcase, coffee shop with coffee at ease (just pick up more capsules in the closet that is at the end of your hallway), among other things. I was not missing anything at all. Plus the location is great, super close to the subway. You can quickly go anywhere in town! Loved my choice!"

Luke is someone who will make you feel at home and you won't feel the presence of. On the other hand, if you need anything Luke is very friendly and helpful.

Luke was a very good host with items offered in the 'pantry' in the bedroom. He was very responsive and even sent me a message prior to my trip to confirm when I will be arriving. That was when I realised that I had not booked the place for the first day of the trip (one of those mistakes I made due to the time zones). When he heard about that, he provided alternatives to stay at, which I appreciated.
There are a few things you may wish to take note of. It has a shared bathroom but there was no issue during my stay. I appreciated having access to the washing machine and the dryer since I was there for close to 2 weeks.
Also, It's a walk-up apartment so you will need to take note of that (if you have issues climbing the stairs or have heavy luggage).
Overall, it was a fantastic stay. Thank you, Luke!"

Stayed with kids","We recently stayed at Lucas’s place in the Financial District of Manhattan, and it was a true gem. The location was fantastic, we were surrounded by famous landmarks and the energy of Wall Street. It was incredibly convenient, with easy access to the subway for exploring the city.
The apartment itself was unique and beautiful. The walls were adorned with beautiful artwork that created a unique and captivating atmosphere. It had everything we needed, from a spacious living area to a cozy and dark bedroom, which was ideal for my daughter’s sleep, but the place has lots of lamps and lights.
To get to the apartment you need to use the stairs, so if you’re travelling with a kid and a stroller, I recommend bringing a lightweight travel stroller for easier access.
We loved how Lucas had a perfect balance or being available and giving us space. He is a great host and we are already planning our next trip and without a doubt, we'll be staying with Lucas again!"

We were blown away by his beautiful home, filled with his amazing original art, and couldn’t have asked for a more convenient neighborhood for everything we wanted to do while we were in the city. We hope to someday cross paths again with Lucas."

The apartment is beautifully arranged and there is great art by lucas to marvel at. We could use everything we wanted at the place which made us feel right at home. We also had no problems with early check ins and late check outs, lucas was very flexible. It was the perfect place to explore Manhattan from."

He was able to make himself available when we had any questions.
The apartment is beautiful and very well located in the Wall Street neighborhood.
Only small problem maybe, the fact that you can't totally close the door to the room and the neighbor upstairs maybe a little noisy some evenings, but really nothing very inconvenient.
We highly recommend Lucas' apartment & its hospitality."

The apartment is located at the bottom of Manhattan, Wall Street neighborhood, very close to the ferry to the Statue of Liberty and only 5 minutes from the first subway (and a few meters from the first shops, including a very nice ""daily bread"" for breakfast).
The private space is sufficient, the bedding is comfortable. The interest is clearly being able to use the entire apartment (beautifully decorated) as at home, the private chmabre is anecdotal compared to the comforts of the whole.
Lucas is very nice but also very discreet. We didn't know if he was there or not with him."

Stayed a few nights","My stay with Lucas was just amazing. Lucas is a very friendly person and has an open personality. I felt really at home in his house. Lucas provided coffee every morning, so I woke up with the smell of coffee - how awesome is that?! Most of the days I went out to see the city, so I could see the progress of the painting made by Lucas every evening. And Luke provided me with advice on where to go, so thanks to him I had my best experience in NYC - Sleep No More in McKittrick.
The house was nice and clean. It clearly is the house of an artist - paintings everywhere! That was one of the reasons for me to choose Lucas's appartment, and I was not disappointed.
The neighbourhood is nice as well - some shops, some restaurants in different styles and easy to get to with public transport. Try the ""Dead Rabbit"" pub just a few metres down the street. It has a nice atmosphere, and I enjoyed the IPA a lot.
All in all - I had a great stay in NYC, and for a big part of that I have to thank Lucas. Very much recommended place to stay."

Good room condition
Great host.
I want to stay again!
The location is near Wolga, which is relatively safe and has good security for you. There are various subway stations within a 5-minute walk, so transportation is also good.
You will be staying in a guest room in a quite spacious house where the host, Lucas lives. The bed is in good condition. There is little noise outside. There is inevitable the noise between floors upstairs.
There is a Smart TV, so you can see most of Otiti such as Disney Plus.
You can use the restaurant and refrigerator, and you can cook.
There are lots of paintings by the host, Lucas, and fresh inspiration. There is no smell of paint because of the ventilation.
The host is very kind. I was able to get a lot of inspiration from the host's life.
I would definitely stay again next time. Would recommend."

Stayed a few nights","Or stay with Lucas was perfect in every way! He was a wonderful host! Honestly, we have stayed in Airbnb's all over the world, and he is in our top 3 ever - right up there with Bas in Amsterdam, and Penny in Bridlington, England.
Lucas' location was perfect, very near the Bull on Wall Street, Battery Park, and the Statue of Liberty. The subway station was an easy 2 (or was it 3?) Blocks away. There were tons of great places to eat all around! His place was surprisingly quiet given that it is in downtown Manhattan!
The mattress was super comfy, and I absolutely have to know where he got his sheets! I need to buy some today!
Further, Lucas himself is absolutely charming! He was a wonderful host, with lots of great tips, and his stories are wonderful! Do not pass up the opportunity to read his Unicorn Cookbook. Definitely read it the first night you get there!
In all honesty, even though Lucas was there about 90% of the time when we were - (he works from home), it was never the slightest bit of an issue. We never even had to so much as schedule the timing with the shared bathroom. He showered well after we were gone for the day doing our touristy things. Lucas is extremely quiet, as are his neighbors.
Lucas had lots of little touches to make us feel extra welcomed -- an assignment of teas and coffees, and little sweets, and lots of notes about how to make Alexa work. :) He was also very generous about making sure that we knew that his kitchen was there for our use, should we want it.
One of the best things about Lucas's space was his artwork! So many beautiful paintings! Lucas is an award-winning artist, and living in his home for a week was like living in an art gallery!
My only caveat would be for those who might have mobility issues. There are 36 steps up to Lucas's apartment, and there is about an 18"" step-up to get into his shower. These things are quite normal for New York City, but some prospective guests might need to be aware.
There is absolutely no question that we would stay with Lucas if we were to come back to Manhattan in the future! Thank you for a wonderful time, Lucas!"

It is not at all burdensome to share the apartment with Luke who is a very friendly and available host. The guest room is a good size with a very comfortable bed. Water Street is 2 steps from 2 subway stations, bus lines and ferry station (Could Park) to board for La Liberté station. The Brooklyn Bridge is also right next door and cherry on the cake, the (Wall Street) neighborhood is rather quiet, away from the hustle and bustle of Time Square.
Luke works from home, so it's nice to see him in action on his paintings 😊
Thank you Luke for your hospitality, good humor and kindness!

Stayed a few nights","Home in NY!
I have been going to NY since I was a young girl. My grandmother used to live there off of 42nd. Yes 42nd the heart of the city. Not only was it the heart of the city it was part of our heart visting her. She passed 3 years ago so now. Took my daughter for a girls trip for her 18th birthday recently. Wanted to give her the experience I grew up with which was staying in an NY appartment. This I thought was going to be hard until we found LUCAS! LUCAS made us feel st home the minute we entered OUR home. I say our home because that is how he made my daughter and I feel in his space. The appointment is SUPER chic and full of great pieces of Lucas's art and pieces I could relate to. It was located across from Battery park which is an amazing park to stroll through. Very easy and SAFE to get to from MTA. We took the subway everywhere! This home will feel like your home for your time in NYC. Lucas's warm hospitality and home will make your NYC trip unforgettable! Miss Lucas and NY already."

Also easy access to Battery park for a view of the statue of Liberty and a way to avoid the claustrophobia of the high rises in mid town.
Shower was excellent and well apportioned kitchen with real space. Lucas was away for some of our stay and entrusted us with his apartment but when he returned he was very lovely host and very respectful of us as guests.

Stayed about a week","First time ever staying in an Airbnb with the host living in as well and I was a little nervous how it would go as everybody likes a bit of privacy on holiday. My worries we're totally unfounded as Luke is one of the friendliest and most welcoming people it's been my pleasure to meet whilst travelling. Communicative, open and discreet. There if you need something and giving you space if you don't.
The apartment is beautifully decorated with Luke's""s stunning and colourful art and we were the envy of many colleagues after they had seen the gray, midtown hotel rooms they were staying in that seem the norm. The location is deliciously placed near the cooling tranquility of Battery park and the water and is a great spot to chill in after what can be a hot and gritty day in Summery Midtown.
Stone Street just around the corner is full of great bars and restaurants and the subway up north is very conveniently located.
Go for the apartment, stay for Luke. You won't be disappointed."

Stayed about a week","Unfortunately, the listing was not quite as I had hoped. Marjorie was quick and helpful in contact remotely, but closest to me once I was there. It said that you would have access to the kitchen, but that was not quite true. I, after a lot of persuasion, got to use the gas stove, at first she wanted me to use the microwave for everything. I only cooked breakfast and only used one pot, even though the kitchen was fully equipped, after this. I would not be in the kitchen at the same time, but was referred to waiting and preferably I would stick to my room, I understood gradually. Didn't get to sit and eat at the dining table in the living room. Just didn't feel particularly welcome. Other: bed was narrow but ok, bathroom clean and warm. Great shower. Room was cold, no extra heat source. Got to keep my groceries in the fridge. I was hoping to get some good advice for my first visit to NYC, but it felt like I was most disturbing. Sad, because I think we had a lot of interests in common!"

To get to any subway stations it’s at least a 20 minute walk through iffy parts of town and there’s a lot of blocked off sidewalks. I also couldn’t finish a phone call in my private room before quite hours because the host complained to me about my noise. Besides that it’s an ok place."

Room was comfortable and the nice (and clean) private bathroom is a real plus. I personally prefer an airBNB where the host is present.

She was very helpful and her place was just as it was depicted. It was clean and quiet. Her unit was right in the heart of an adorable, eclectic neighborhood that has restaurants and shops within a short walk. One of the highlights was the NYC ferry, which was only 3 short blocks that took you to Pier 11/Wall St. It was literally a 10 mins ride to Manhattan for $4.00. I took it several times, and it was incredibly efficient with beautiful scenery. Highly recommend staying with Marjorie. I hope I get a chance to visit again soon."

You can get to Manhattan by ferry, beautiful! Or drive with bus 61 near the apartment, but its passage is a little random sometimes. Or walk 20 minutes to the subway.

Stayed one night","By far, the best Airbnb I’ve stayed at in NYC.
The basic…safety, cleanliness, comfort…were all excellent, but Marjorie’s space is a sanctuary and a must see hidden treasure NYC spot. (Even if you aren’t staying there, or are looking for a staycation or some inspiration, you’d want to visit her space).
Her art collection is amazing. Her space is a borderline women’s rights museum… that is very inspiring and empowering! (This is including the wall of Marjorie’s achievements). ❤️
The space is very peaceful, full of love, flair and intelligence.
I’m lucky that I was able to take a tour of the space. And grateful for the stay. The community was awesome, full of love, friendliness and respect. Citi Bike dock literally down the street and easy walk to the ferry dock (so peaceful beats the subway times a million).
The cherry on top, was the short walk/run recommendation Marjorie gave me to Valentino Park…..no words, all heart… probably the most serene spot I’ve encountered in NYC. 🫶"

It worked perfectly for our group of 3. The location works well if you are a walking group- we walked back from the subway every evening between 10-midnight.

Milton is the best host I have ever met and I highly recommend his place for a great and safe experience of New York."

When meeting Milton he was wonderfull and pleasant man. Apartment was beautiful and really clean and give us true New York experience. Metro and food markets were close. Next time we will just contact Milton view days earlier before traveling to New York and I know everything will go smoother. Thank you Milton!

Stayed about a week","Milton was at his best with us, very welcoming, always smiling. Very good tips for getting around New York and where to shop close to the place.
He was very accommodating on the departure and arrival time, always a quick note, knowing how it went when we met him and always a little time to chat.
I recommend living this place with its fantastic host, it is about ten minutes from a subway mouth that leads to the central points of New York City in less than 30 minutes.
It will be suitable for anyone who wants to rest in the evening, it is very quiet, you can hear very little of the surrounding streets."

Stayed a few nights","The very first host we've encountered who waited for us outside their home, greeted us, walked us in, showed us their home, & most of all, chatted with us the moment we arrived! I was shocked because most hosts do not do this, so it was meant a lot & it definitely made both my husband & I feel at home. Milton was super kind & friendly. His home looked exactly the photos & was very clean. It's a very big space (especially for 2 people) compared to the hotels I've stayed at in NYC. Very comfy bed & the duvet was amazing! The brownstone home is just a 5 min walk from the subway which was a plus! There's also a deli & grocery store down the block if you want to grab some chopped cheese late at night. We'd love to stay here every time we visit NYC! It was such a pleasant stay & it's all because of that very first greet the moment we got out of our Uber. It makes such a big difference in the world to be greeted by your host! See you soon Milton!"

It's possible to be more beautiful, our anticipated.
We almost didn't want to leave the apartment in the morning as we felt at home.
Milton was a very kind gentleman, helpful, always smiling.
The place is very good, from the metro it was 8-10 minutes about, around there are small shops, entertainment all what anyone needs :-)
We felt safe , we walked the house in the evening after dark, and everything was in order.
It's about 15 minutes by subway to the center, so you're quick.

Milton was a great host and was very accommodating. He met us early to take our bags before the room was ready, and allowed us to drop keys off as we had to leave a day early. Milton was great chatting with and was always very responsive when we chatted.

Stayed a few nights","The host, Milton, made us feel at home and was even kind enough to accommodate our need to drop off luggage a bit early. We had the 2nd floor street-facing room which was very clean, spacious, and well arranged. Towels were clean, plenty of hangers, comfortable L-sofa, full sized fridge/freeze and microwave, and other kitchen essentials we would need. The drip coffee machine was essential for our morning routine so it was well appreciated. We always looked forward to returning to the comfortable and relaxing room after a long day of exploring NYC to wind down. If I were to return to the area I would definitely put Milton's place at the top of my list again."

The price is affordable compared to the city average, given that it is a real apartment equipped with a kitchen (complete with all comforts) and private bathroom. If I have to find an aspect to improve, it is the availability of bathroom cleaning products and an extra set of towels, especially if the stay is longer than three days. I absolutely recommend it. Milton is very good and available"

Stayed over a week","Cozy apartment as seen in the listing. Very clean and the kitchen has everything you need to prepare breakfasts.
Milton is 10: he greeted us kindly even though we were a little late, he explained everything to us, gave us recommendations and allowed us to delay the departure until our flight time.
The location of the apartment is perfect because it has very close to the 125st station that allows you to get to the center in 15 minutes (lines A and D especially).
Despite being in Harlem, it's a safe neighborhood (we moved around the night and first thing in the morning and we never had a problem). It is true that there are certain groups that are formed at night but they never told us anything, although perhaps the worst thing is the noise they generate, that if you have light sleep you do not rest well.
It is a recommended accommodation to spend a few days in New York at a price and with a reasonable quality."

The kitchen has everything that is needed to make breakfast or to cook basic meals. Harlem in general is a little further away from the typical sights, but we really enjoyed walking through the Central Park and there is a subway station relatively close by to go to downtown. The neighborhood itself also offers plenty of food and fun places to visit.

There was a subway entry just a couple blocks away which was very convenient. As well as a couple of grocery stores close by to get essentials. Milton was a great host! Responded to text messages very quickly and was willing to help with any questions we had. Check in and check out was incredibly easy. Overall it was a great experience and would highly recommend Milton’s place to other, and would stay there again."

The apartment looks exactly as it does in the pictures. Super clean with brand new appliances. It's a great location within walking distance to the Apollo Theater and other landmarks, two fitness clubs, a grocery store, and the A, C, E trainis. Milton was a great host. He met me at the apartment and even helped me with my luggage. I highly recommend the location and the host!"

Parking is not tough at all, Subway is just a couple blocks away, and plenty of good eats nearby in case you get back late from the city. Definitely the place to stay in NYC and will be coming back."

was exactly as it appears in the photos and very clean. It had everything i needed for my weeks stay in NYC. It was a bit further out from most of the sights i planned to see in central Manhattan however it was very well connected with express trains so i had no difficulty getting where i wanted to go."

Everything about the stay was good. If you are parking a car be mindful of the limited parking because of the location. Of course this is no reflection on the residence or the host, just something to note. And it is very convenient to the subway!"

Stayed a few nights","The place was exactly as advertised and a great deal. Great kitchen, shared. My only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5: host mentioned that parking was 'on the street' and not being from the NY area, I assumed that meant on the same street the place was on. But we circled for a long time looking for parking both evenings, and both times had to park blocks away and around a few corners, which we weren't mentally prepared for. Had to drag our stuff in the rain for those blocks to the place. I would still have taken the place if I knew but would likely have arranged to arrive earlier, when it was still light out and more parking might be found. Otherwise, a good deal and a good place."

I want to mention to anyone that the room is not in a basement, its on the main floor and it can get noisy, especially around 7am or 5pm but I wasn't in the house a whole lot during then. And the doors dont really close properly, especially the bathroom door so hopefully that gets looked at. But it didn't hamper my stay as it was a cheap place within a good location and bed was good so it met my expectations still."

The best part was that Julie happens to be from Denmark so it felt as if it were meant to be. The room looks exactly as pictured and even looks a bit bigger than the photos. Julie was flexible with my check in and check out times due to flight delays and being stuck on the subway. Met her family, lovely people all around. Perfect place to stay if you’re a solo traveler and need somewhere to stay that feels safe and friendly if you are unfamiliar with or nervous about staying alone in Brooklyn. Will definitely book again if I’m ever in the area!"

Stayed a few nights","Loved my stay at Julie’s! I had a packed schedule so I did not need anything but a place to stay and this private room seemed enough for me. I was pleasantly surprised to see how comfortable it was, how private the bathroom was, and how friendly the host and her family were. I ended up relaxing in the bedroom much more than I expected to! Julie and her family were very helpful, provided us with all the advertised and necessary utilities, and made it easy for us to keep our privacy and go in and out as we pleased. Not the calmest place in the world, but compared to other places I stayed at in the area, this was relatively very light on street noises as it was on a more private road. Also, importantly, it is just a block away from the subway station, so going to Manhattan using the 2 and the 5 was a breeze. I loved my experience and would definitely repeat it again!"

Stayed one night",Had a great stay with my wife for a weekend in NYC. We found parking right down the street and walked about 5 minutes. Check in was incredibly easy and very friendly staff. We got up to the room relaxed and used the shower. Very clean room and bathroom with a nice bed. We had a late night out and got back around 5AM. It was nice that check out was at 12PM and we were able to rest and cleaned up before heading out. Check out was again incredibly easy and friendly staff. We didn't explore the neighborhood too much because we have lived in NY/ NYC our whole life. Really just needed a place to stay for the night for our date night and it was perfect. When we left there was a big food street fair going on and tons of stores and things to do. If we find an event nearby again I would for sure stay here. Thanks for a good time!

Stayed a few nights","Chelsea's place is in fact a room at the HANTON Inn Manhattan Chelsea hotel.
The rooms are all well made, very large, clean and with a large bathroom.
Breakfast is included in the price and it's not bad. The only flaw in the breakfast area is that there are some tables nearby, a strong smell of vinegar because they use a very unpleasant cleaning product. The rooms are missing hangers or a jacket hangers and need a new air conditioner because it is very old and noisy.
The rest of the room is perfect, large spaces, very comfortable bed and large bathroom. Bath products are also good. I especially appreciated the size of the room, really spacious by New York standards.
host Chelsea doesn't exist, but you'll find the hotel staff at the front desk."

I was afraid that I paid to scammers…
Generally I called to airbnb support and they found host, info - finally situation was resolved, but it was stressful for me, as a foreigner.

Stayed one night","""There will be mandatory taxes and fees"" is not a good enough sentence, especially when it's buried deep inside the listing. There will be a mandatory 15% tax/fee to be paid is more like, as the first sentence of your listing. Otherwise, ok enough. Bathroom lacked space, furniture, fittings and appliances were aged but clean, the complimentary breakfast was really inn-like (would've been cute in an actual inn, but it just felt tawdry in this hotel-like place), and I spent 30 minutes in the check-in line, and 20 minutes in the checkout line. Overall, happy with the stay, but unhappy with the surprise 15% fees. I was under the impression that the credit card charge they made at check-in was simply a refundable security deposit."

I’ve never had an air b&b stay cost extra fees so I did NOT expect this.
I’m surprised air b&b would allow this.
Other than that, it was a normal hotel stay. Not overly fancy. Good location. Clean.
I do prefer homes over hotels, that’s why I use air b&b. Now I know I have to be very careful in the future."

Stayed a few nights","There was so much that I loved about staying at The Arthouse! The location, the Patis Bakery, the Arthouse Bar, the communication from the hotel itself, and the proximity to great restaurants - just to name a few.
However, I experienced some unfortunate issues that impacted my stay and rating, most of which applied to the room itself. The entire room was covered with hair when I arrived. It was clear that some areas were wiped clean, but the floors, desk, coffee table, and bathroom were wildly dirty. There were still toothpaste stains on the shelves in the bathroom and some stains on the lampshades/curtains as well. I ended up going to the CVS next door to get some cleaning supplies so that I could take care of things myself to feel more comfortable. As a solo female traveler, I chose not to draw attention by alerting the hotel.
I've provided this feedback to the Airbnb host, as it seems it could be an Airbnb issue and not a hotel issue. I hope it gets better in the future!"

View can't be beat, apartment is simple but lovely, all is quiet because of being on the 32nd floor, so this feels like a calm oasis in the middle of Manhattan. Perfect for a couple. Enjoy!"

Stayed a few nights","It just doesn’t get any better than this beautiful space. We felt welcome and the view made you want to jump up and down on the bed in glee (which we didn’t do). I would come back in a heartbeat. ❤️ The property is in a very safe building acrosss from Central Park. The location allowed us an easy walk to Broadway, Carnegie Hall, MoMA, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Kitchen amply stocked with everything needed to cook (we didn’t). And the apartment was very quiet compared to the noise associated with NYC after dark (the city truly never sleeps). Check-in was super easy and helpful. Local recommendations for dinner were included. We fell in love with the Carnegie Diner. This is your pie superstore, btw. Temperature controls in the apartment were cozy, big tv with streaming, and a shower with water pressure worth the soaking. I wouldn’t change a single thing. Be careful that you look for window washers when getting dressed 😜."

Subways, with a stop at 96th Street @ Central Park West, are easily accessible to the Theater District (not too many steps at either end.) I heartily recommend Marty's guest suite. I like to prepare some of my meals--many markets are available from Whole Foods, Trader Joe's to neighborhood groceries and most of all Farmer's Markets. Simply put, a great place to be in New York."

Stayed a few nights","This is the perfect NYC AirBnB! Look no further, and book! The private unit occupies the lower level of a very beautiful NYC brownstone townhouse. With your own private entrance, you’ll feel like you own the place! The place is quiet, clean, and comfortable! The host, Marty, makes it extra special. Marty was so responsive, it was like messaging with an old friend. Oh and the shower pressure is divine. The towels are soft, and the linens fresh and clean. I slept great on the bed, which is firm and helped me have a restful night. At night, there is no light peeking in through the blinds, and there are Alexa controlled lights for the outdoor area! I loved opening the blinds for the light each morning. I can’t wait to go back. Thanks Marty!"

Stayed a few nights","We loved our stay! It’s a beautiful, very clean space with tons of room and all the amenities you’d need, and more! The location is perfect and convenient. You can easily access multiple subway lines and get to any part of the city with ease. Very close and quick walk to Central Park and a quick subway or Lyft ride to Rockefeller, Times Square, etc…
The steam shower is amazing! Such a luxury to enjoy after a long day exploring NYC. The area is cute, and quiet, and has a lot of options for food and drink nearby if you don’t want to venture out too far. Marty is a fantastic host! He made sure we had everything we needed and made our stay seamless! We can’t recommend this space enough. Thank you, Marty! We can’t wait to come back and stay again!"

His place is a rare gem in NYC because it is a quiet place, yet you are still in the middle of all the action. Both my brother and I live in NYC and know the city well - we are thankful for having found Marty's place for my parents to relax at when they come visit us!"

Stayed a few nights","Okay so I don’t know where to start because there are so many good things about this place.
So when me and my friend decided to stay longer in NY, we needed to find a new place. But you know why would you want another place when you know where is the best? Luckily Marty’s place was available at that time so we were able to extend our stay here.
I’ve been using airbnb for many years now but I’ve never had a place where offers you two water bottles for the stay. Just with this fact, you could tell how thoughtfully managed this place is.
On top of that, there is a TV with premium channels, a super comfy bed, a perfect shower booth, well equipped kitchen, a safe entrance, a beautiful backyard etc. I mean seriously Martin’s place has it all.
If you want to make your NY trip extraordinary, I highly recommend this place. Because you can’t go wrong with this air bnb!"

The steam shower is wonderful and powerful! The bedroom has plenty of storage and loads of extra blankets and pillows, and the bed is very comfortable. With an enclosed garden patio next to the bedroom, there was NO noise outside. The kitchen has everything you need - toaster oven, microwave, coffee maker and roomy fridge. It was the perfect space and location for us."

Blocks away from everything (central Park, coffee shop, restaurants, Riverside park, subways to rest of NYC), but yet tucked away and quiet when you need a reprieve from the hustle and bustle. And, Marty is a great host. Really thoughtful - ready to help and accommodate your needs. he truly wants the guests to have the best stay possible! Highly recommend this place to anyone.."

The furnishings are cheap looking and very used. The picture does not reflect accurately the furnishings inside. The outside garden is also filled with cheap dirty furniture. The garden itself is dirty, it looks like it hasn't been cleaned in a very long time. There's nothing inspiring about the garden which could and should be a great feature of the apartment. The blinds on the windows are broken; the mishmash of furnishings are old, torn or falling apart."

Stayed one night","What an exceptional experience for our first AirBnB experience!!! Marty is excellent at communication, friendliness, and meeting his guests' needs! He has renovated a beautiful garden apartment in shades of gray with a lovely tile floor, new bathroom with fabulous steam shower, comfy bed, and beautiful view (including use) of his backyard garden & dining area. What a peaceful oasis in NYC and yet easily accessible to Central Park!
The neighborhood is lovely -- with his townhouse on a street lined with trees, interesting and beautiful townhomes of either brick or stone. And yet if you love Dunkin Donuts, there is one just around the corner. There are many very good restaurants close by -- unfortunately due to scheduling we didn't have a chance to sample them on this trip.
Also when we expressed a special need, Marty very generously extended himself by taking his personal time and walking many blocks to meet our request. This is really far and away what most hosts would do! Thank you, Marty, for a great and memorable stay!"

Columbus and Amsterdam have great shops and restaurants, too. I only wish we could have stayed longer!"

Stayed with kids","I chose the studio because of the location. Having lived in NYC for two years, I knew I wanted to stay on the Upper West Side. It's just a wonderful part of Manhattan. Even without taking anything else into account, the location is perfect. It's a couple of blocks from various Subway lines, including express lines; bus stops, restaurants, grocery stores, and not to mention Central Park! So, for example, if you want to go to Times Square, you can walk two and a half blocks from the studio and take the express Subway line and be in Times Square in literally two stops. This is a great neighborhood to experience life ""as a New Yorker,"" if that makes sense. You have access to everything, but are not staying in a tourist trap. Every morning I walked a couple of blocks to an Italian coffee shop to have a chocolate croissant and a cappuccino, and passed by locals walking their dogs and commuters going to work. Just a great neighborhood vibe.
In terms of the studio itself, you can't ask for a better Air BnB. The host (Marty) is professional and well organized, and he takes his role as host very seriously. He really cares about your comfort and is easy to reach. That said, he also expects you to follow very reasonable rules he has set out. When you go into the studio and you understand the neighborhood dynamic, it becomes evident why those rules are in place. I would say that if you're looking for a place to party and make noise at all hours, this studio (or this neighborhood) may not be a good fit.
By NYC standards, you have plenty of space and you have a private patio, which is unheard of! The studio also has a remodeled sink and shower with fancy jets. The bedding is very comfortable, and there are enough places to sit, as well as surfaces to set things down. Again, this is by NYC standards. (New York is a place where physical space is always in short supply.)
Highly recommended!"

Stayed over a week","From the beginning, I felt welcomed and at home at Allison’s place. We were both quite busy — I was staying in New York for work — but Allison was always very friendly, kind, helpful and warm-hearted. She was always very open and listened to me when I need to get some (personal) things off my chest. Her dog was super cute and quiet. I didn’t mind that Allison was reorganizing her place when I was there — and she was super apologetic about it, but the shared spaces were always very usable and my room was great. She always made it clear that my room is my space and that she would never enter without my knowing or permission. I asked for clothes hangers and she gave me that plus a whole rack for my clothes. The bed was spacious and really comfortable, and the little heater was helpful when it got cold. The area felt safe, even at night — which is important as a young woman. I definitely recommend staying here if you’re in NYC! Amazing quality for the price!! Great experience overall :)"

There is a large television with a variety of applications for watching which was lovely for my arrival evening.

The kitchen has a wide variety of appliances if you wish to make your stay cheaper and eat at the property.

She was very flexible and accommodating for our living arrangement. She helped us 3 struggling girls carry our luggage/bags up the stairs, and made us feel right at home. She gave us great recommendations of local food/places to visit, and even kindly brought us to visit Grand Central Terminal. The airbnb location is great, within walking distance from Central Park and other iconic landmarks are accessible via the subway. I had a lovely time getting to know and staying with Allison, she is awesome!"

Just remember, it’s New York, so everything is extremely small (including the bathroom sink!) Also, it’s a fourth floor walk up with serious stairs, so that takes some effort with bags."

The one thing I would mention from a marathon perspective is that her location was not ideal to return to after the race. Staying in the UWS would have been a better option with its proximity to race exit."

This ideal for those in their 20’s and 30’s. It’s definitely a fun space and vibe.

Stayed a few nights","Truly 5 stars! Sara and her brother Matt are excellent hosts. We lived in Manhattan some years ago, and we wanted a nice place with a kitchen, laundry and space for the four of us to relax and be together when not going around the City.
From the time I booked, Sara was very responsive and very nice, and when we stayed, her brother Matt was equally so.
They did all the extra little things, and they clearly care about their guests. We felt that, and they even sent a gift my son saw and complimented (just to be nice).
The gym was fantastic on the 30th floor, but it was clear the building is trying to make it more challenging for short term rentals, and so if you are a gym rat, reach out and make sure that still is okay.
They said “our home is your home” and they meant it.
It is a lovely unit, with great views, comfortable firm beds and fantastic hosts. Not cheap, but in our eyes, absolutely worth it!"

Apartment was bigger than it seemed online - lots of space. Hosts were great - Sara and Matt offered recommendations, reached out before we arrived, checked in while we were there. Could not have asked for more and would definitely stay there again."

Group trip","The VIEWS!!!! This rental was one of my very favorites for many reasons. The view of the Manhattan skyline, especially seeing the Empire State Building lit up every evening, was fabulous. The location was perfect for us; it was a 15 minute walk to see several Broadway shows during our stay. Having a gym on site was great. The doormen were all so helpful and kind. And the hosts, Sara and Matt, both so nice, were beyond incredible. They got back to us immediately and went out of their way to make us feel at home. The apartment had everything we needed for our family of 4. Especially loved the cozy and comfortable beds!! We can’t wait to come back to this place!! Thank you Sara and Matt - best hosts ever!!"

Stayed with kids","What an amazing space with literally million dollar views. No need to go to the Empire State Building or other high scraping attractions when you stay here. Aside from aesthetics, which were top notch, the host/s were absolutely amazing. From spending hours helping us before we got there coordinating lost grocery deliveries to checking in while we were there to make sure everything was okay they were so supportive and kind and helpful. The location puts you so close to theaters, food, subways, and most everything you would want to see is within a 20 minute walk if you opt out of public transportation.
We were 3 adults, a teenager and a 7 y/o and we fit perfectly into the space. It was comfortable, spacious, full of all of the things you need for it to feel like home and so quiet. I absolutely recommend the space, and Sara and Matt pushed it over the top. For many of our party’s first time in New York, it was an unparalleled experience and the home had so much to do with it."

She was always so friendly and always so quick to respond to any of my questions. We had a wonderful time in NYC. Our apartment was so comfortable and it was the perfect place to come home to after a long day of exploring NYC! The views are simply amazing and I slept like a baby every night. The apartment’s proximity to Times Square and the 42nd St/Port Authority subway stop made seeing the sites of NYC so easy & convenient. I would be so so so happy to stay here again the future!! Thank you so much ❤️

Stayed a few nights","Times Square, Broadway, etc. is just a short walk away, if you call Uber, you can easily access various places, so you can easily access various places.Edge, Central Park, summits, ferry stands, and large supermarkets are all close to the best location.
Regarding the room, when you enter the room, you will spread the night view before your eyes.It is a high-rise, and you can see the Empire State Building and the H&M building, which is the overwhelming.
The room has a variety of glasses such as champagne glasses, cocktail glasses, and wine glasses, so you can enjoy a drink while watching the night view.
The interior of the 2 bedroom is also very nice.
The host was also very responsive to suggestions, quick replies, and thoughtful language on the trip. It was my first time traveling with Airbie, but I felt at ease from the beginning to the end.I am very satisfied.
Highly recommended space and host."

Stayed with kids",Our family instantly felt at home in Sara's gorgeous property. We had originally thought to visit lookout points of the city such as The Summit or The Edge at Hudson Yards but didn't waste our money since the view from here was even better! It was hard to leave the comforts of the apartment. Just working or reading by the windows was relaxing with the breathtaking views. My daughter says she's never slept in a more comfortable bed and I have to agree that the beds were just heavenly! The kitchen was also well stocked. We had a very special family dinner the night after we arrived and it truly felt like home. Also important was the communication with the host which was excellent from the start of our booking to after checkout. We look forward to returning soon!

The checked in on us before we arrived through the duration of our stay & Evernote the day after we left! The location is within walking distance to pretty much anything you need. The view is spectacular. The pictures do not do it justice at all. The sunrise & sunset are to die for. You have amazing restaurants at your fingertips when you’ve had a long day out in the city. The staff are so personable and very kind! There are great coffee shops right around the corner for that early morning need! The topper was a washer & dryer. That to me is a must need when you’re out all day, and you can have fresh clothes whenever you need them. The beds are very comfortable and allow you to oversleep without knowing! A whole week wasn’t long enough and hope to be back soon. Thank you for everything! ❤️"

Stayed a few nights","We recently stayed at this 2 bedroom apartment in New York and I must say, it was the perfect place to stay in. The location was fantastic walkable to many of the tourist attractions and Broadway theaters. The apartment was very spacious and comfortable for a family of 4. The rooms were cozy, and the living room/kitchen area had enough space for us to hang out. Sara and Matt were very responsive and attentive to our needs during our stay, which made communication between us very hassle-free. Checkin and check out were both simple and easy.
More so, the apartment had a great views of the city, including the Empire State Building, and it was a beautiful sight to see, especially at night. In conclusion, I would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone visiting New York. It contributed to making our trip an enjoyable and memorable one."

Stayed with kids","From start to finish, the hosts (Sara and Matt) were incredibly proactive and helpful. There were some issues that were out of the control of the hosts, but they were quick to respond and came up with fair solutions. The condo itself has the most amazing views and the amenities were used often (pool, jacuzzi, terraces). Plenty of space with the 2 bedrooms and a large living area. We've been to NYC over 30 times in the past 30 years and have never quite stayed so close to Times Square. Being at such a high floor level cut down tremendously on the noise so that was not a factor at night. The location was WEST midtown so that was much better than being in the heart of Times Square. We did enjoy the local food places (as usual) and found ourselves going to more Broadway shows just because it was so close. If you have any hesitation about staying near Midtown, I think families will enjoy this condo. We were a bit nervous at first, but this was a great decision."

Sara and Matt were extremely responsive to our needs and inquiries. They really made our group feel welcome! We loved the floor to ceiling windows and blackout curtains for sleeping in.

We were two couples. One bedroom has a wider bed and a private, large bathroom with bathtub. The other bedroom has a narrower bed and for the smaller bathroom with shower you have to walk through the apartment.
Furniture of the living room no longer as in the picture. Unpleasant covers on the sofas. Floor plan of the apartment (in photo) would be cool.
Tips nearby:
Supermarket: Big Apple Meat Market
Very nice selection of meats, vegetable and herbs
Sea Breeze Fish Market
Perfect selection of fish, mussels, crustaceans. Tuna in sushi.
Wine
West 42nd Wine and Spirits: Great selection of wines.
Fresh Direct
Online Supermarkt. Versatile selection. Reliably delivers in a 2-hour time slot. You don't have to be home. Packages are received at the bottom of the building. They even have a huge fridge for food deliveries so nothing spoils."

The apartment has a great layout with views from every window and so spacious. It’s nice having a washer dryer to clean all your clothes upon leaving.
The area is safe with a market across the street and good Italian restaurants in just walking distance in Hells Kitchen. Easily can walk to time square or catch a short Uber outside. We even walked back from Central Park and just took 20 minutes.
Door dash and Uber Eats and Amazon deliver right to Saras apartment door BTW.
The buildings doormen are pleasant. Sara is helpful!

In the entrance area of the building, bouncers are responsible for the safety of the residents. These are extremely friendly and help with any issue. In the building itself there is both a swimming pool and jacuzzi. As well as a sauna and a large fitness studio. The apartment was very clean, very positive I found that consumables such as soap, toilet paper, dishwasher detergent etc. were sufficiently available.

Stayed about a week","What a fabulous apartment! The outstanding experience begins with easy, quick and friendly communication with the hosts Sara and Matt. The apartment offered everything we needed as a family of 4 to explore the city: Enough space for adults and teenagers, very well-equipped kitchen for breakfasts and drinks (we did not cook, but everything would be there to do so), comfortable beds to recover from long walks, very limited noise considering a location in the heart the apple. A lot of attractions are within walking distance of few minutes, including many good restaurants, food markets and shops, as well as most Broadway theaters and access to the subway station. To use up your final energy there is a large, clean, supervised gym, a nice swimming pool and jacuzzi with view of the Empire State building. But without a doubt, the most spectacular aspect of the apartment are the breathtaking views from all rooms, all the way from the Hudson River, small parts of the Central Park, midtown high rises such as the Empire State building down to One World Trad tower and even the sea! We could not stop enjoying the ever-changing shades of light, highlighting different details of the town as the day (and night) went by. So in short, the apartment is worth every penny, and we could not think of a more easy and at the same time spectacular way of experiencing NYC. A big thank you to Sara and Matt for being such wonderful hosts."

The location is excellent, the views are spectacular, it was extremely clean and organized, all the communication with the hosts was great, the doormen and staff were extremely nice and helpful, everything about checking in/out was easy. The apartment is very high up, so it’s very quiet and peaceful. You don’t hear much at all from the street. The area around the building is safe to walk through - we walked to and from the theaters very easily. It’s a short walk to get to the subway or to Times Square or to a nice supermarket. We had intended to fly but ended up driving, so Matt gave us some suggestions for where to park our car and that was great - it was only a block away and the cost was reasonable. The bathrooms are very nice and there’s an incredible amount of storage in the larger bathroom. Lots of drawers with organizers in them, so you can unpack and put away all your toiletries and cosmetics. And the showers were fantastic! The one in the larger bathroom has a deep soaking tub, too and they are almost completely enclosed, so the steam stays in them and doesn’t fog up the mirrors at all. We were exhausted at the end of every day, so a long, hot shower was much appreciated! Don’t hesitate to stay at this apartment! It’s fabulous and we would not hesitate to stay there again! Thank you, Sara and Matt!"

Parking garages & grocery stores within less than a block distance. The host was very communicative. She checked in from time to time & made sure we felt comfortable. Check in was easy, polite & welcoming doormen 24/7. My stay at this place was 100% worth the amount spent. Next time I'm in NY I will definitely be staying here :)"

Group trip","What we can tell is that the apartment dazzled us from entering it, including from the entrance to the building, including from the entrance to the building. The views it has are fascinating, as being at an angle of the building has stunning views to the east and north. All rooms have tremendous views. Also, the apartment is super comfortable for a family with three children like mine. The equipment exceeds all expectations, making you feel truly at home since you will not miss anything at home, we even feel better than at home!!! The location is spectacular! Being extremely close to everything!, but at the same time in a place that is not as noisy as in time square (I think better located could not be) Finally, but I think it is the most important thing, we have to highlight the friendliness, attention and warmth of Sara and her brother Matt, who were always by our side so that our stay is 10 points and undoubtedly was 11 points. Even Matt, which I already consider a friend, was always on the lookout and helping us with problems in the return flight when the stay was over. In short, we can say that everything was super spectacular and highly recommended. We will definitely rent this apartment again and see Matt and Sara that we are already missing them."

Stayed about a week","Thanks to Sara and Matt, my family and I enjoyed a perfect Thanksgiving week in their apartment. We sought out apartment options over hotel rooms so that we would have a chance to spread out a bit, do some cooking for ourselves, and have a comfortable respite from the hustle bustle of NYC. This apartment surpassed all of our needs and expectations. The views are truly phenomenal (hard to decide if they're better at night or during the day), the furnishings are extremely comfortable (namely great beds!), and because of the high floor, we were able to enjoy NYC in this very peaceful and exceptionally quiet apartment. Our hosts thought and responded to our every needs—I inquired ahead of time about the coffeemaker, and they were thoughtful enough to ensure we had ample coffee pods for our stay! The building is clean and safe and has great amenities. Highly recommend!"

Furthermore, the midtown theaters are all in walking distance as are a wide variety of restaurants. While located in the heart of the city, the apartment itself is quiet and peaceful. We spent a lovely two weeks there.

We were due to arrive earlier for check in and she was very responsive in helping us…our flight was delayed 5 hours so there was no need for early check in and she even offered for a later checkout.
Easy to get to from Newark, NJ Airport and everything we needed was close by…In New York there’s a lot of walking and Lucineia’s place is in the perfect spot!!
We saw a show at Radio City Music Hall and it was a very comfortable walk there and back with so much to see and do on the way.
Lucineia is so easy to text with and her response was always quick.
I’ve stayed at many Airbnb’s around the U.S. and Europe and for sure on my next visit to New York City I will most definitely look up Lucineia!
Thanks so much for the Great Place and Service!!

The only surprise was that it wasn’t a pull-out sofa bed, but rather a fold down couch, so it is a rather small sleeping space if two are sharing it.

Stayed over a week","Two of us spent 18 nights in the apartment so got a good feel for this nice one bedroom apt, as well as the area. The apartment is bright, but quiet, as the windows give on to a space between buildings and backyards instead of the street. The bathroom and shower are very good with lots of storage space for toiletries. The kitchen is decent, not fully equipped, but good for breakfast and very light meals. Air conditioning is welcome and comes in handy, but depending on the weather you can also get a good breeze through the window. The apartment is tastefully decorated with quality items including a wood floor comfortable bed, and big mirrors. The elevator is fast and efficient, and the entry is safe, with an external locking gate. The area (north Chelsea) is very convenient for subway and train connections, and has a good amount of convenience stores and supermarkets nearby. We walked almost everywhere in Manhattan from there.
Check in and was fast and simple."

Stayed a few nights",Myself and a friend stayed at Lucineia's place for three nights and it was perfect! Very cute apartment with everything we needed. Bed and sofa bed super comfy. Everything spotlessly clean. On a high floor on a residential street so it was quite peaceful yet only a few minutes walk to all the action. We loved Gardenia Deli around the corner which had great coffee and pastries etc. Will definitely stay again. Thanks Lucineia!

Stayed with kids",Had a great stay at Lucineia’s place! She was able to let us get in to the unit a few hours early so we could drop our luggage and use the fridge for breast milk. This was such a huge thing for us because traveling with a baby is no easy task. Her place is right by Penn Station too which made getting there from the airport a breeze. The building was quiet and clean. Couldn’t ask for more! I will say she does prefer to communicate via text which is not typical for me and my experience on Airbnb but I didn’t mind.

The apartment was as described, well-kept, quiet and comfortable. All the amenities we needed were there. Would absolutely stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","Great location, almost everything 15 - 30 mins walk away. Convenient for subway and train station too. We traveled to and from JFK - very easy. The apartment had every thing you are likely to need, was clean and stylishly presented. Everything was “as described” in the listing. Communication was good and instruction full and easy to follow. Even though Airbnb advise that check in information will be available 72 hours before, I would have preferred to receive the detailed check-in information earlier, perhaps a week before our holiday (maybe that’s just us older folk!). Thoroughly enjoyed our holiday, and would recommend Lucineia’s place. Thank you."

Stayed with kids","Lucineia's place was located in a convenient location, easy access to the subway, and close to many restaurants and shops. The Airbnb was spotless and was accurate to the listing description. The apartment inside appears new and modern. We also appreciated that the host provided a pack 'n play crib upon request, which was important as we were traveling with our toddler. We enjoyed our stay overall and would come back! A few suggestions would have made the process even better, such as communicating directly in the Airbnb app (vs. text), making sure the right address was listed, and specifying what coffee maker was available since coffee/coffee pods were not provided. Otherwise, we were happy with our stay and would recommend this Airbnb to others visiting NYC!"

Stayed a few nights","I book Airbnbs more than half of the time I travel and sometimes it’s a hit or miss. This wasn’t the case with this space. I will 100% be re booking this space when I am visiting NYC. Lucineia was an amazing host who sent check in instructions well ahead of time, she was accommodating to our travel plans, and was over all an amazing communicator. The space really felt like home and matched the description/photos.
The airbnb is super close to a lot of things. There’s a Whole Foods, Starbucks, Hudson yards, Trader Joe’s, Walgreens, all within a 5-10 minute walk. It is also really quiet which was important for us as the city can be a bit loud at times. The bed and linens were very comfortable! The kitchen has what you need if you prefer to cook which we did a few of the nights. The unit has a nice view but still offers privacy. Lastly, I think this space is in a great area for those who are newer to NYC or more experienced :)"

Stayed about a week","For me it was a perfect place for a 7-day stay in New York. It is certainly not cheap, but there is no cheap accommodation in New York.
I thought it was perfect for money.
It's true that the rooms are the right size, but in my case, I didn't need more. A good bathroom and a good room.
In terms of location, it is what would most highlight of the accommodation, you can move perfectly walking anywhere and if you do not want to walk, you have the entrance to the Canal St metro at the gate.
There are a lot of noise negative food items, but it didn't seem so bad to me. It is true that there is noise, but it is bearable if you are not very manic and you can sleep perfectly.
The only negative point I would put is that they do not do the cleaning while your stay lasts, but I already knew it in advance, since they clearly indicate it, and that the windows seemed to have never been cleaned, but well... I would not stop going for that reason."

Well located, manages to walk to various places and there is a metro exit at the door. The location is more or less in relation to the neighborhood, because it is half zoned.
For the good price, even more that was last minute and it was in NYC.
It was made literally just for sleep, don't expect a hotel because it's not."

However, these are easy fixes because in the lobby they have a bunch of baskets of room needs (toilet paper, tissues, ear plugs, etc).
Besides that everything is great! I’m a NYer and needed a little staycation to help make work commute easier & something cheap. Affordable for NYC prices and right in the middle of everything. Will definitely be back again!"

A little noisy if you’re not used to city sounds and you’re on a lower level of the hotel, but they provide earplugs which is helpful!

The location is excellent as the Canal St subway station is right outside the hotel (10-15 minutes to Times Square, for example). Moreover, the room was clean and staff were helpful."

The subway was close to access to get to the city and we also walked to multiple bars and pizza places within the area. I appreciate that they keep the doors locked and usually had staff at the front desk. Our bed was comfortable and we had what we needed for our quick stay. Thank you!

There’s a subway station right outside the hotel and other stations just a few blocks away. The room was clean and tidy, a little small but with everything you need to have a pleasant stay. The area is a little noisy so I would recommend bringing some good earplugs. The staff was very attentive and helpful. I would definitely stay here again. I think it’s totally worth it for the price."

The location is perfect because it’s right next to the subway entrance which makes it really easy to get around and find your way back with no trouble. If you fly to JFK and get a subway R,Q,N to downtown get off on Canal St. and it will drop you off right at the location. There was great Delis around to have breakfast on the go or to eat there as well. I feel satisfied with the money value of this place. I recommend it and would come back."

If you need to take care of our bags after check-out, they make a payout of $5 USD, I feel that it could be included in the total fee."

I wasn’t once concerned about the cleanness. The sheets were fresh, and the bathroom was great. There were so many amenities that I wasn’t expecting. Such as the complete kitchen (oven, toaster, fridge, microwave, etc.)
The location is amazing, as it is less than a block from the subway line. There are grocery stores walkable distance too.
The host was very responsive and quick to action on every concern we had, even though they were on vacation as well. Super super friendly. Would definitely stay here again whenever in New York!"

Kakuna is very available and above all very accommodating, we had a last-minute contingency and she was very understanding. All his explanations for entering the accommodation were very clear as well as the operating instructions for the accommodation.

Extremely clean premises with everything I needed and amazingly quiet. Super clean. Kakuna is very responsive while respectful of privacy. I was impressed with her Organized and clear information and her very helpful written guide to the area. In sum, this is a safe place near Saint Nicholas park and other iconic spots that would give a visitor the true nyc experience in a positive sense. I came to ny to help a relative with a move but i regard Kakuna’s place as an excellent spot from which to experience Manhattan, see broadway shows, visit museums, eat out, shop, stay for business, celebrate with a significant other, attend a graduation, etc."

Stayed a few nights","I wasn't sure if staying so far uptown was going to work out for me, but I was wrong, it really was the BEST way to do my visit to NYC. The AirBnB is a basement apartment, but it's wonderful because it's as peaceful and quiet as you can get in NYC. I saw that someone felt the apartment was quite dark, but as someone who doesn't sleep well without blackout curtains, it was perfect for me.
The place is exactly as described and it's like you're staying in the downstairs of a relative's house where you are free to come and go as you wish. Street parking is free in this area for those who drive in and the subway station is just a half a block away.
There's also a ton of great sights in Upper Manhattan within walking distance such as Hamilton's Grange and the historic brownstone lined streets. There's a great coffee shop just up the way and just so much history all around. Not to mention, you're just 20 minutes away from anything you want to do Downtown."

The place is very accessible to subway and is walking distance from many things. The area is fairly safe and has a nice park a block away. The only thing that I was not fond of was the unit is below street level. This means that you can hear people walking by and some people stopped to talk. One group was having an argument on the phone we had to listen to for a good 10 minutes. It all happens during the day though, so it was fairly quiet at night. Overall this was a very convenient, clean, and nice place to stay. I appreciate the accuracy in the descriptions and clear instructions."

Stayed a few nights",The house and the location was perfect for two people. Very peaceful and beautiful area with the subway station just 2’ on foot. Kakuna the owner helped us store our luggage before our check in and was very responsive. If you need a budgeted and cozy place at a good location that’s the place to be. Highly recommended.

Harlem itself is a wonderful place. we met many people and highly recommended Maison Harlem for food and drinks just a ten min walk away. overall a perfect stay, we would highly recommend this stay and would not hesitate to choose it again when staying in NY"

From before our arrival time, exact instructions on how to get to the apartment and all kinds of facilities to be able to leave the bags both before check-in and after check-out.
Being already in NY, she cared about whether everything was going well for us as we were traveling with our 10-month-old baby. She recommended things to do and took care of asking us for the taxi back to the airport.
The apartment is just like the photos, very cozy and more than enough to travel around NY. Very quiet area very well connected.
I definitely recommend it!!! Very good experience."

I had an absolutely lovely stay here on a safe and very quiet street in Harlem, only ½ block from the train that goes directly into Midtown and Lower Manhattan. These Hosts are by far some of the best prepared for guests that I've experienced. The place was spotlessly cleaned and unbelievably well equipped, right down to the pots and pans, silverware, dishes, glasses, feather comforters, and even laundry detergent and dryer sheets. Nighttime was dead silent, the bed was firm like I like it, and the heat and hot water were more than generous. Their communication went above and beyond, which really made me feel welcome. The next time I’m in NYC I’ll check their availability before any other."

Stayed over a week","Exactly as described, immaculately clean. Premium finishes; didn't feel like Wayfair/IKEA furniture. Plenty of linens. Didn't feel like a tiny New York studio. Good internet.
Everything you could possibly need for an extended stay, seriously. Didn't have to buy anything ""home"" related (cleaning supplies, sponges, paper towels, Tide pods, etc.)
Fast elevator. Laundry room was never busy, affordable. I didn't see anyone over 35 in the building ever, but not loud or busy. No families. Cute guys.
I am very picky and this place was 5-stars, 100% met my needs. Good value.
Location (irrelevant to the host and apartment):
- 2 trains nearby if that'll be your method of getting around.
- Not much to do or eat down there, but easy to hop to other neighborhoods. No stores, markets, simple restaurants, etc. Unless you're going to Cava or Cipriani every night, you'll need to travel to eat.
- I think Ubers cost less coming from that area, but there are fewer. Had to wait every now and again."

Stayed about a week","A very well located apartment, close to many subways which makes it very easy to walk around Manhattan and have access to all the places to visit quickly. Emir is very responsive and very friendly, he always responded quickly to our requests and even allowed us to leave our luggage until the evening since we had a late flight. The apartment is large and very convenient, it has everything you need for a pleasant stay.
The only downside is the bar that is below that made a significant noise on Friday nights and a terrible noise on Saturday nights until very late, it was impossible to sleep before 2:30 am. So accommodation to avoid on weekends if it's like this every weekend or we were not lucky on the 2 Fridays and the Saturday we were there. The bar is closed on Sundays and Mondays.
At Emir's, a perfect place to visit New York on weekdays."

Lots of local non-brand businesses, with interesting restaurants. Try King Barka chicken for cheap. Go find Sylvia's for fancy and historic. Parking was the easiest in the city. Apartment was very nice, with a double bed, and full kitchen. Bathroom clean as well. Milton was flexible to allow an earlier check-in as I was moving from one AirBnB to another. Excellent communication. He greeted me at the door and gave me the keys after a brief and friendly chat. I'll hope to stay there again if I can book the space for my next trip. If this is available for your dates, you should grab it."

Stayed a few nights","Both this apartment and even moreso Milton are gems. My wife and I planned an NYC vacation on a budget and Milton’s space was a fantastic spot for us. Milton was incredibly kind, gracious, and we were able to have several great conversations with him. He met us both when we arrived and left and we were appreciative of the free parking and close by street parking. I highly recommend Milton’s apartment and am thankful that we were able to connect with him."

The bed is a little bit snug for two big vikings but for a happy couple I am sure it is great. The neighborhood is safe - same amount of homeless people as in any other neighborhood - and you get a familiar service in the stores."

White Space hosted by Milton was perfect for location (safe, close to shops, subway) and the unit had all the features and services as advertised. 
When communicating with Milton prior to our arrival, he gave us excellent instructions on getting to his place from the airport which was really helpful the following days finding our way to and from the subway.
Milton also gave great advice on the local area, and helped planning our daily trips around NY. 
We really felt at home and would highly recommend it to anyone who visits NY.
The local subway (125th Street) has  express services and you can be in midtown in 10 minutes downtown in 15 minutes"

Really appreciated the assistance :-) apartment was clean & warm, and the kitchen had everything needed to cook. Can’t fault the host or apartment at all! The location was further away from everything than we had realised, so a lot of walking was needed, there is a subway relatively close by (125th st). Would recommend the local Red Rooster for live jazz/food (suggested by Milton). Had a great night there."

We flew into NYC early in the morning from a long overseas flight & Milton agreed to let us move into the rental unit way before the check-in time. He gave us directions to the property & was waiting for us when we arrived. He helped us with our luggage & as soon as we got inside the unit talking with Milton was like conversing with an old friend. He made us feel at home. The unit itself was as described & more than met our expectations. The unit is extremely close to a variety of subway lines & other public transportation, & for walkers/hikers like we are, it’s also close to Central Park. We had a fabulous & restful time at Milton’s place & we highly recommend it to anyone visiting Manhattan."

The neighborhood is endearing with its small shops and supermarkets (don't miss the fish specialties to take away at Lighthouse!). It's perfect for immersing yourself in African American mixed culture, just a stone's throw from the Apollo theater and the gospel churches!
The studio is impeccable in terms of cleanliness, bright, well-equipped especially in terms of cooking. The decoration is very nice, and with views of the gardens and interior courtyards. The bedding is very soft and comfortable.

Milton has been so nice and helpful, he waited for us outside the apartment while we arrived from our late night flight
He made sure we had everything, he bought us some groceries too, how nice
The flat itself is really clean and way enough for two people
The mattress is really comfy, it feels clean too, everything is good !
About the area, we did everything by subway, I’ve read reviews about 10min walk but it is really 5min to the station
The area is safe and interesting, we still booked Lyft or taxi to come back home from Manhattan when it was dark because of laziness and comfort but I’m sure it is fine !
I can only thank again Milton for his welcoming personality, that made our week really special
Also he printed for us our boarding passes for our flight home, which is really nice
I recommend it by 100 !
Merci encore !"

As for Milton, we only have words of appreciation. We are waiting until late in the morning on our arrival, he answered at all times with doubts that we were coming up and, in addition, he had the deference of leaving us another room to quietly make a ""late check-out"".
Definitely a 100% recommended place!

The shower was out of order but it wasn't an issue for one night and looked like it was fixed by the next day. All's well that ends well.

Stayed about a week","The appartment was in the perfect place, right walking distance from everywhere if you want to walk. Iryna was helpful and fast to reply anytime we had questions, even being proactive to ask if we had arrived okay. The room is small and the building looked old, but I guess it's everywhere the same, but the fact of having the upper bed gives much more space to it. We can't complain about anything from our stay :)"

Stayed one night","I just wanted to take a moment to thank Iryna for hosting me during my recent stay. While I didn't have the pleasure of meeting her in person, the online communication was good & all of the information for check-in and WiFi was well-documented and easy to follow on the AirBnB webpage.
Although the apartment was quite small, it was cozy and had all the necessary amenities. I really appreciated having a furnace, refrigerator, AC & even a washing machine available during my stay. Climbing up to the bed 2 meters above was a unique experience & made the most of the limited space in the apartment.
The location was great, with easy access to the Madison Square Metro line, which made it easy to get around the city.
But I do have to mention that the apartment staircase and public spaces are not clean, which was a bit of a disappointment. It would be great if the cleaning could be improved to make the overall experience even better."

Stayed over a week","The room was clean. The location is very good. Close to supermarket. But there were always insects in the room. Even if I knocked it down, it came out every day, and I couldn't sleep well. We had pesticides, but we sprayed them every day and had to smell them all the time, which was a pain. It's nesting in the back of the kitchen, or it's coming in from somewhere, so I think the host needs to do something about it immediately. Also, the breaker trips easily. The breaker tripped several times during my stay. Also, it may not be the host's fault that the bathroom can't be locked, but there were comments before, but it hasn't been improved, so the management system should be managed somehow. I didn't feel safe taking a bath. The interior of the room is stylish and doesn't feel dirty, so if you can improve the above points, I think it will be a very wonderful room."

Iryna's place was absolutely perfect for exploring the city, super close to everything including the subway, warm, quiet, easy access, in a safe area and Iryna was flexible with our check in. Perfect place to sleep after a long day seeing the beautiful sights of NYC."

Unbeatable value for money.
The apartment is small but has everything you need if you don't have any luxury claims. The toilet and shower are in the hallway directly opposite (you have to get used to it but there was never a problem and it was cleaned very often). Air conditioning worked great in hot summer. The apartment is lovingly furnished.

Clear instructions allow for easy check-in. Iryna was able to accommodate my early check-in request too. The room was as advertised, high loft bed, microwave, fridge, iron – everything was there. The bed is comfortable (and it was out there, as described), and the AC works well. It is a clean, quiet, and overall homey habitat (I loved the wall art). The shared shower and toilets were capped clean, though the quality of the areas is lacking. Overall, it is a good choice for those on a budget. Furthermore, the prime location makes it a rare find for its value."

Stayed a few nights","This is a great location for staying in Manhattan, close to subway, and many things to do. Sam was a very responsive host always communicative and helpful. The apartment is vintage, with radiator heating that can make a lot of noise banging at night. The apartment is really small, and this influences the size of the bathroom and kitchen. You cannot simply walk through the bathroom. You have to shuffle sideways its so narrow, and to sit on the toilet request some gymnastics moves. For a larger person it would be a challenge and the shower is also small. The Kitchen as well was very narrow and to move through it you have to shuffle sideways. I think these 100 year old buildings are just like this, so some people might be used to such tight quarters, but not everyone. The bed is a queen mattress on a light metal frame. Its OK for one person."

Stayed a few nights","This air bnb was very disappointing. Starting with the check in there was some confusion on where the air bnb was even located because the address givin on the app is not the same address the host sends you via text. I believe this is because the real address is not suppose to be used as an airbnb. I found this out because i mentioned the confusion when we met and i said the word “Airbnb” and she rudely told me i could not say that word in her property. Then there was an issue that me and my wife were traveling with our 7 month old baby. She said she does not allow baby’s in her property and when i looked back at the house rules i never saw anything as such. The property overall was ok and the location was great for doing all the tourist stuff for the weekend. Everything in the property is cheap and doesn’t make for a super comfortable stay.Also, the host was not very welcoming and even at check out seemed rude. We were nothing but friendly and kind and didn’t get much of that back."

It is quite a small apartment but that’s to be expected in midtown NYC. It also is a 3rd floor walk up with a rather steep staircase. The bathroom overall is fine however the toilet is rather close to the wall so it can be a bit awkward. The one main thing missing was a couch or a comfortable sitting place to relax and watch TV."

(FYI, it's a third floor walk-up, no elevator, also common in that area.) It had lovely touches reminiscent of its original era, early 1900s or earlier - high ceilings, tall windows, crown molding, carved mantle. It had everything we needed and then some, and the location was awesome! Two blocks from the Empire State Building, easy access to many restaurants, the theater district, subway, etc. We come to NYC about once a year and will definitely stay here again!"

If you want the heart of manhattan, we definitely suggest their location as a fair priced, central NYC location. Additionally, their apartment has all the essentials, is clean, is private, decent bed, and relatively quiet for being in the heart of the city. We would recommend overall!"

Stayed a few nights","Staying with April highlighted what makes Brooklyn special: the neighborhood feeling. It was like having my own apartment, with a friendly, helpful neighbor nearby. I had full use of the kitchen and bathroom, and a charming and super comfortable space, with a bed and a couch, occasional tables, rugs, and terrific, warm lighting too. I brought a bike with me and April had a stand where I could store it safely and comfortably, so that was an added bonus. Her place was central to subways and bikeable streets, and there are lots of restaurants and bodegas nearby too. Would stay here again in a heartbeat."

Stayed a few nights","April really respects and cares about her guests and offers all the support you need for your stay. When I arrived she showed me where to shop, find the Subway, gave local advice and was always very kind and helpful throughout my stay. The apartment is spotlessly clean throughout and the bedroom is very comfortable, spacious and quiet and you have use of the kitchen whenever you need.
The subway is a short 5 minute walk from the house and there are supermarkets and shops for you to buy food very nearby. The living room and bedroom have lovely plants and it is a lovely space to come back from the city and relax in. There are bed socks and slippers so your feet are cozy - a lovely thought.
I would gladly recommend April´s home and thank her for making my stay in New York so special."

Sharing the space with April was hassle-free and communication with her was very easy and quick. The neighborhood is lovely and I feel Bed-Stuy is the perfect place to stay for a trip to NYC. The subway is close by, there's great cafés and restaurants all around and it's just a non-touristy, cool place to stay."

Stayed a few nights","Really great stay! The space is beautiful and close to the metro. Solo female travellers - the walk from the metro to the stay can be a bit unsafe later at night (like many places in NYC), so just be more vigilant / Uber at night. The room has a curtain instead of a door covering it, but April is very respectful of your space and whenever she’s in the house she has her own door closed. I really enjoyed this stay a lot, especially for this affordable price range in NYC. A gem! Thank you, April!"

Stayed a few nights","April is so kind and it was so comfy here, it felt like staying at a friend’s place. I walked in and was welcomed with a light scent of incense, which I love and made me feel right at home. April supplies a super soft face towel, shower towel, and the coziest house socks. The bedroom I was staying in was clean and spacious and had direct access to the kitchen. The common area is cozy and has a lot of natural lighting. I felt like I had privacy and I felt very safe. Also the temperature was perfect - it’s chilly in November so it was nice coming to a perfectly warm apartment, unlike other air bnb’s in nyc I’ve stayed at where it’s 30 degrees out and there’s no heating, so I’m very thankful for that. The A and C trains are a 5 min walk away. If you have accessibility needs it’s up 2 flights of stairs, this is very common for apartments on the east coast though. I’ll definitely stay here again!"

Stayed about a week","I loved staying at April’s! A really beautiful apartment & a very friendly host. The one thing I will say is that there is no air con (there is a fan) and the bedroom was a bit of an oven BUT - I knew there wouldn’t be aircon as it was advertised and I didn’t expect it would be 33 degrees centigrade at the start of fall. So that’s on climate change. The one other thing is that there’s no ceiling light or big lamp in the living room so it’s quite dark at night. Again, I’m not fussy so I don’t mind. Would recommend, especially for the price."

The location is perfectly situated to cross over to manhattan via the subway and to access the plethora of suburbs inside of Brooklyn as well.

The space is comfortable, private and really clean. This is the property of truly home-proud people.
Getting around is amazing located between 2 train/subway stations so accessibility is simple and there are options around. However if you drive, it can be a little bit of a pain getting a roadside parking spot being a residential district, hence be prepared to circle around for a spot or walk a bit.
I had such a great time staying and working out of the room, though if you have a lot of baggage it might be a bit of a challenge moving up and down the steps leading up to the rooms (slightly steep and narrow).
Otherwise, lovely place, even lovelier people who are so filled with love and warmth."

Stayed a few nights","It was a great stay at Laura’s place. Thank you Laura for your friendly communication and comfortable accommodation.
• Communicating with Laura was so easy. Definetly I’d be back if I stay in Brooklyn again.
• Cleaning and the bathroom was stunning. Everything was provided. You share the bathroom with the other Airbnb room, not with the host.
• Location is so peacefull, safe. You have to walk 8-10 minutes to subway. Only 2 trains come to that station but they are fast and going to Manhattan. Of course you can stay at Financial District and reach all the subway lines but it is also at x10 price. Brooklyn is a big borough so even Dumbo is like $40-50 with Uber, but the safety is also important for Brooklyn.
• Bed was okay. Could be better? Yes. But it still is comfortable.
• Room is very big. I had 3 luggages and managed to fit in which is a big plus for me.
• The room is on the second floor, carrying luggages can be hard for 10 minutes but price for this wonderful house is great."

Laura's ability to be present and to show that I was heard and not just a transactional host/guest situation made me feel like I lived there! When I would get back from the conference, her dog Ash was great to greet me at the door, and also took part in the conversations as well! I also liked the balance of doing my own thing and Laura being available if needed with any questions.

The shared bathroom was in great condition with cleaning supplies available for clean after each use. If you are planning on spending most of the time in Manhattan, double check to see if the Subway is running by Laura's place. It wasn't during my stay, so I had to take busses which took me over an hour to get back and forth each way. This was the only downfall. Other than that, everything was perfect!"

The house itself is very charming with lead glass windows and a winding staircase, an antique. The area is quiet and peaceful and seemed very safe to us.

We were allowed to move freely in the house on the ground floor and the floor where our room was. The information for the check-in was early enough before arrival , so you knew exactly how to find the place and get to your room.
The house is full of art objects of different kinds. So there's something to discover in every corner. Although the majority is for sale, everything is lovingly coordinated. Even the glass jars by the window are lined up in a rainbow color arrangement.
We enjoyed the conversations in the evening with Laura, her daughters or even friends of the family very much .
It was an incredibly great stay and the connection to the subway ""Q"" is just great. I absolutely recommend this place and hope to be a guest in Laura's house again someday!"

Stayed a few nights","Laura is a very accommodating and friendly host, the place is as represented in photos. The kitchen is very easy to use, including a guest fridge well labeled for everyone’s belongings. The bathroom is sooo nice, definitely worth soaking in the tub. One thing to note is she runs an antique shop which occupies most of first floor of her house including the living room.
Our one issue is with the subway access, it’s quite spotty. Obviously this isn’t in Laura’s control, and it wont be a forever problem. But there is only one train that stops close to her place and right now it is not running on the weekends and during the week/ evenings the train is not stopping at all stops downtown. Meaning that on weekends you’ll be walking about 22 minutes between the subway to her house and during the week you really should keep your eyes open for notices about the Q train, especially at night.
Still… worth the stay. We’d stay here again :)"

However, it is not in the extremely congested midtown touristy area (which we enjoyed). The space looked exactly like the photos online and had the most comfortable QUEEN beds. We utilized the Nespresso machine, which was so wonderful to have. Menachem was flexible and allowed us to keep our luggage inside the building after check-out.

Beds and bedding were very comfortable and we enjoyed being able to take, store and eat our leftover food. We really enjoyed our stay. Thanks again!"

The apartment faces an interior and we heard zero street noise. You can get away from the touristy areas, try some quieter cafes and restaurants, and experience the real Manhattanite lifestyle here."

I appreciated the queen beds (as most hotels offer doubles) and the extra space of a studio apartment. The location is an easy walk to Times Square, where we spent a lot of time at Broadway shows. I appreciate how safe and quiet this neighborhood is and the price absolutely cannot be beat. We will definitely stay here again."

If they were on vacation or otherwise engaged, it would have been good to know ahead of issues. Instead we were ghosted. In addition, there was only hot showers in the morning. I get it, it’s NYC and things can get funky. If we knew about the hot water ahead of time, then we could have planned for it. Both nights it was low pressure and barely warm. Otherwise it was quiet, felt safe and again the location was good for us getting around Manhattan."

The place was just as the photos show it, and for NYC, it was very quiet at night so everyone could sleep. We would definitely recommend it and would stay again.

Stayed a few nights","The location is fantastic and the apartment is ok, but the heater was broken with only cold air blowing out, especially in the bathroom. The bath curtains were stained brown, and the kitchen had a leak. The outlets didn't work so you couldn't plug in the heaters and it's not safe to sleep with heaters on nor did we know that we had space heaters until the following day. We made it clear that the apartment was beyond freezing and the owner didn't respond until the next day and was going to send someone over when we were out and it didn't feel right to not be there if someone came into the unit. But after that- he stopped responding to us and that's when we decided to leave the unit because it got colder than the day before with no way of heating it up and no contact from the owner."

Bathroom was spotless and pest free. There isn’t really a working kitchen, but there is just about every plug-in kitchen appliance imaginable plus a nespresso machine with plenty of pods. You’d have no problem prepping a full breakfast and/or a light lunch. There’s no elevator, but I had no issues getting up 2 flights of stairs on my own with a small suitcase and backpack. 8 min walking to grand central. Overall, I feel really lucky to have found this spot on short notice and would stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","The interiors are clean and tidy. Equipped with the essentials. Pillows and sheets are all hotel quality.
Getting to the unit, however, is an extreme challenge.
Be forewarned - this place has no elevator, and has steep and narrow stairs. You will have to be physically fit enough to pull your heavy suitcase/luggage up three flights of narrow stairs. The unit is at the 3rd floor.
It is not advisable for senior citizens, people with disabilities, and people with several pieces of luggage in tow.
The description of the place must include a caveat - no elevator - to give potential clients a heads up - especially those who are not familiar with interiors of older buildings in Manhattan. Yes, the listing did not have “Elevator” among its amenities but just like how other listings would typically do, this should have been listed under the “Not Included” section for emphasis.
As to response time, the host did not reply within a reasonable amount of time, at least in my case."

Stayed a few nights","While I truly wanted to give this place 5 stars, one major issue makes it kind of hard to do so.
Before I get into that, let me start with the positives. The place was very clean and had everything you’d need. The location was perfect and close to many things, including restaurants, bars, Times Square, etc.
The host was also great and responsive which made check in easy and smooth.
Now the one (big one) issue. For the two nights I stayed there, the folks in the unit above were so loud that we couldn’t sleep for two nights straight. Usually, noise doesn’t bother me in NYC because it’s expected in such a big city. But this was unbearably loud.
The unit above this one is owned by the same host as this unit and they did try to tell folks to keep it down. But that did nothing.
If it wasn’t for this issue I would def recommend this place to fam and friends in the future."
