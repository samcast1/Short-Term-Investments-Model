Stayed a few nights","This place is small but really sweet- great kitchen, bathroom, everything was very easy. It's not a treehouse per se, but there are many trees and even a creek out the window. A train does go by pretty often at night, but people tell me that can't be avoided in Spartanburg."

A lovely surprise was a few snacks made available upon arrival which were perfect for us coming in close to midnight. If we ever return to Spartanburg again, hopefully the Treetop FROG will be available."

The space was nicely outfitted and exactly what I was looking for. The deck off of the bedroom was a great place to sit and unwind at the end of the day.

5 minutes or less from downtown food and fun. The deck is an amazing place to decompress - with a private view of the woods and creek.
Laura earned all the praise we’ve given her lovely place. Every comfort was considered including shampoo and other necessities.
Thank you for the super comfy stay, Laura!"

Stayed over a week","This was my sixth stay (three weeks this time) in the ""Treetop FROG,"" so it feels like home! I love being able to relax in my own private, peaceful space before and after busy days. Having a real kitchen so I can cook a good breakfast is a must, and this one is stocked with all the pans, dishes, and utensils I need. The whole apartment is equally well-equipped, with a large dresser, folding tray tables, plenty of shelves in the bathroom, etc. The wifi is fast and stable. Laura is always extremely responsive, helpful and friendly! The location is very convenient; the quiet neighborhood sits between two main roads, so you can hop on one and be on your way. I highly recommend the FROG!"

Stayed over a week","This treetop studio apartment is cozy, private and peaceful and sits on a beautiful piece of land with a babbling brook in back. My favorite thing to do is sit outside on the deck, drink coffee and listen to nature. It was very clean at check-in and Laura, the owner, lives on site and is very responsive to emails and requests. I texted her that my bathroom sink was draining slowly and she was upstairs within minutes and fixed it. There is no washer/dryer but there is a very clean laundromat about a mile away which Laura recommended. The property is on a quiet, out of the way street but shopping and restaurants are about 5 miles away in any direction and a parking spot is included. The kitchen has full size appliances, dishes and cookware all you need is groceries. I had a very comfortable and enjoyable 3 month stay at Treetop FROG and would happily come back. It felt like home."

Stayed over a week","This was my fourth time staying here; twice in 2019 and twice in 2021. I love living in my own little home while in Spartanburg. It's so much quieter and more comfortable than a hotel room, plus it has a full kitchen! (I'm a big fan of a good breakfast.) The location in almost the center of Spartanburg is very convenient - I can get anywhere in the city in under 15 minutes, and I-26 and I-85 are both easy to get to when I need to head to NC or Greenville. I very much appreciated Laura's snack jar; jet lag makes me hungry! She and her family are very nice, and she is extremely responsive to messages. Always a five-star stay!"

Stayed a few nights","There are hosts, there ade super hosts, and then there is Laura! From moment one of reserving the FROG, Laura had excellent communication. Her pre check in instructions were spot on.
The FROG rental unit was impeccable. Squeaky clean, well decorated, with lots of extras that many hosts wouldn't think of including.
Her family is wonderful, and we had a wonderful time playing with & feeding her dogs!
The FROG overlooks a creek, so be sure to take advantage of the balcony view that overlooks it. i can't emphasize how her attention to detail is reflected in the unit.
This is one of the best hosts I've had the pleasure of working with, which makes the FROG an incredible value!"

Stayed a few nights",Laura was the sweetest host and made sure to check in that we had everything we needed for our stay. She asked questions on our plans for the trip and even went as far as giving great suggestions for state parks and food around the local area. We made a point to take all her advice on activities and loved every minute of our vacation. Very quiet neighborhood and beautiful scenery around the home and FROG. I would absolutely recommend this spot to anyone visiting Spartanburg! I hope to be back to the state soon - possibly for good. Overall a wonderful experience!

It’s in a great location: about 10 minutes to Spartanburg Regional Medical Center, and less than 5 from downtown Spartanburg. It was a great option for short term living, as it had everything I needed. Laura is also so nice (she hosted me for Easter dinner) and very responsive. I would recommend this place for anyone visiting Spartanburg!"

Stayed about a week","Laura's F.R.O.G. exceeded our expectations! My husband and I spent a week there, and it was perfect for our visit. First, the location is convenient to any part of town, including restaurants only a short drive away in downtown. The suite is cozy, comfortable, and well-designed. The kitchen was a big draw for us when selecting an AirB&B, and it didn't disappoint. It is a full kitchen, and Laura has put a lot of thought into stocking it with dishes, glasses, utensils, pans, dishcloths, spices, coffee/coffeemaker, snacks, and various cooking ingredients. The bed was comfortable, and there were extra covers available, if needed. There was plenty of space in the dresser drawers for us to unpack for the week. As for the setting, you really feel that you are in the trees! We enjoyed hearing the babbling water in the creek out back, and Laura's backyard is so peaceful. One morning, we awoke to the sounds of an owl in the large oak tree in the backyard. We appreciate that Laura doesn't charge a cleaning fee, and she provides ample cleaning supplies for you to clean the suite before you leave. We will definitely stay here again when we return to Spartanburg. Thank you, Laura!"

My wife and I greatly enjoyed the suite and found it very clean, comfortable, and perfectly suited for our needs. The area is quiet and peaceful and the balcony overlooks a beautiful creek. The suite had plenty of amenities and it was clear that Laura had thought through all of the little things that guests might need. Downtown Spartanburg is only a couple of miles away and many restaurants and shopping locations are very close by. Laura was easy to communicate with and she patiently guided us through extending the reservation when we decided to stay an extra day.

Stayed about a week","This was my second time staying here. (My first review, more about the space, was in May 2019.) Laura was once again a wonderful host; I had a special request this time and she was very kind to grant it. The apartment is so peaceful and cozy that I didn't want to leave each morning! Several recent reviews mentioned a train; I am a light sleeper but it never woke me up, and I don't even remember hearing it during my previous stay, so don't let that discourage you. The location is fantastic; I have to run all over the upstate visiting family and friends while I'm in Spartanburg, and from Laura's place I can get to the westside, downtown, I-85 or I-26 in minutes. I highly recommend the Treetop FROG!"

Stayed a few nights",Laura's place is comfortable and feels like home away from home. She greeted us warmly when we arrived. The internet speed was fast so watching Netflix or getting on the internet was never a problem. There were some basic food items and toiletries available. The view from the back deck of the room is beautiful overlooking a creek and many large trees. The area is quiet except for hearing a train whistle occasionally. But I would rather hear that than hear other people talking and walking up and down the hall and slamming their doors in a motel. The air conditioning and ceiling fan kept the room at a comfortable temperature. Great place to stay for the weekend while we attended my husband's niece's wedding.

It is located in a quiet and safe neighborhood very close to both the East and West sides of town. I will be staying here again on my next trip to Spartanburg. Thanks Laura!"

During my stay I had a family emergency and I couldn't have wished for a more accommodating host! I would love to keep Laura's place a secret for myself but instead I must give her the highest of recommendations!"

Stayed about a week","I LOVED my stay! It is obvious Laura put a lot of thought into designing and furnishing the apartment. There is plenty of storage space, so I could unpack and feel at home rather than have to live out of my suitcase. I felt very safe, which was important to me because I was traveling alone. It was very clean, quiet and comfortable. I appreciated the little extras, such as the bowl of fresh fruit, the spices in the cupboard, and the shampoo/conditioner/body wash dispenser in the shower. The kitchen was well-furnished and the appliances worked well. I enjoyed relaxing on the sofa after breakfast with my coffee and a view of big green oak leaves (it really is like living in a treetop!), watching the news on the Roku TV and listening to the birds singing. I hope I can book Laura's ""FROG"" every time I visit Spartanburg; I will be sad if I have to stay in a hotel there again!"

Laura was quick to accept our last-minute request and most respectful of our privacy. We found numerous thoughtful touches and attention to details throughout the space. The neighborhood was very quiet, the stream gurgled quietly, and owls hooted softly in the nighttime. This is a most hospitable place which we hated to leave and look forward to visiting again."

Coffee, snacks, cold water bottles waiting in the refrigerator, laundry supplies....all were provided. Wonderful location convenient to retail & restaurants in the area. Great fenced in backyard for a dog. Thankfully we were able to extend our stay for an extra night when needed. Laurie was flexible and responsive to all communications.

We were short some supplies ( TP, trash bags) and those were provided within a few days. What would make this place a 5 star would be updating the appliances. The refrigerator while really cute in blue was very small for 8 people.
Overall its a really cute house in a nice neighborhood but needs some updating and followup with the housekeepers. Overall a good stay."

We were in Spartanburg for our son’s rugby games at nearby USC Upstate. We opted to work remotely a few days, and three of us easily managed virtual meetings at desks and tables in different parts of the house with great wifi.
We took long walks in the beautiful tree-lined neighbourhood and nearby Croft Nature Preserve. We enjoyed delicious meals at Debbie’s restaurant recommendations and cooked by us in her fully equipped kitchen with teal accents.
Thank you Debbie for the perfect home for our first visit to South Carolina!"

Stayed a few nights","I was excited to get a reservation at the Teal House. It’s a wonderful craftsman bungalow. We arrived at night to a dark house without exterior lighting. Upon daylight we could see the grass was overgrown. The porch had not been swept. A large nest is on an inside post. There are cobwebs on the front bricks, including from the light fixtures to the doorway. The inside window blinds are broken and unworkable. The chairs in the family room are terribly soiled. The screen door to the deck would not close. The laundry appliance buttons are broken. We were expecting charming, not under maintenanced. We expected a better presentation from a 5-Star accommodation. Southern hospitality was not at the Teal House during our visit."

Our granddaughter stays with us at Teal House, and our son and family come over for meals. There's plenty of room for family dinners. If we decide to cook, the kitchen is well stocked with everything we need. The fenced back yard is super convenient for letting our dog out at night.

The house works for us because it has everything we need, including a fenced backyard to let our dog out in, is close to our son's house in Converse Heights and close to our granddaughter's school. It's also a beautiful neighborhood for walking our dog. The kitchen is well stocked with utensils and there are two TV's; one in the family room and one in the living room. If I could change anything, it would be to have a sofa and maybe one or two chairs in the family room instead of three easy chairs. I'd also put a TV in the master bedroom. We bring our own TV for that room; but my husband is an engineer and is able to hook it up easily. There is a great space for a smaller TV there.
We look forward to returning in April!

I was skeptical when I read that the downstairs was air conditioned, but the upstairs only had window units in the bedrooms. I couldn’t find any comments in it, so her ya go. We stayed in August and it was HOT outside. The window units kept the bedrooms cold. The bathroom is a “jack and hill” bathroom, so as long as you keep one or both of the bedroom doors open to the bathroom , it will keep the bathroom comfortable. If you close both doors to the bathroom, it will get warm."

The color of the home, furniture, appliances, decor, and the miscellaneous item definitely set this home apart from others. Her communication was great, the neighborhood was nice and quiet and the location was within 15mins of all the places I needed to be... More than enough room for my group, the different parts of the house made it fun, very spacious closet. Our favorite room was the sun room back of the house... We all were able to relax, watch movies and get a little sunshine. 1 of our nights, we all slept on the floor with sleeping bags (Planned) as if we were coming due to open windows. Oan the jetted tub was a surprise. Work very well... Overall, I look forward to taken another 2 hour trip just to enjoy this home again.

The house was well-equipped with all we needed and there was plenty of space for our family of 6 to spread out. We especially liked the large front porch for cooler mornings and evenings, and the light and sunny air-conditioned sunroom for the hotter parts of the day. We took advantage of the gas grill for dinner one evening.

Group trip",We loved our stay at The Teal House. It was the perfect size for our group of five while we visited my Dad for a couple of nights before heading to the beach. The A/C worked well and the sunroom was our favorite place to hang out. The teal decorating added a sense of whimsy to this very comfortable place. We'll be back!

Group trip",Debbie is a 6 STAR Hostess. She has done an excellent job with the Charming Teal House. The home was built in 1930 but has been updated and is charmingly decorated. I strongly recommend the home for families attending events at any of the excellent Universities in the area. The only drawback to our visit was the Train Noise in the middle of the night and the early morning that disturbed the ladies. I have slept through rockets in Army so it wasn't problem for me. I enjoyed our stay. Debbie has other properties the we would consider checking out. Enjoy.

Close distance to Dray Bar & Grill. It was about a 6 minute drive which is where we were having our rehearsal dinner. The location and cleanliness of this place is fantastic. Debbie was very accommodating as well. Nice neighborhood as well. Quite with plenty of room for parking. We were able to park along the street in front of the house.

Stayed over a week","This place is a BIG house. I suppose that is relative of course but it was plenty of space for my partner and I, as well as our two greyhounds. Everything was perfectly clean with plenty of spare towels. We stayed here because a tree fell on our house so it acted as the perfect home away from home during our non-vacation. The kitchen was also equipped with most things that you would need in terms of cookware. I actually thought that for an airbandb, the knives and pans were quite nice. As others have noted, the sunroom is an incredible feature. There is a heater in there if you're chilly during the winter.
A thoughtful touch of this home is that there are outlets EVERYWHERE. My partner works from home so he needed to plug in his laptop, cell phones, etc. There were surge protectors, and outlets galore.
You can also stay up to date with your shows via the two Roku tvs.
Just be aware of the school drop off times and you're going to have a great stay."

We enjoyed playing scrabble from among the many games she provides. Plenty of coffee, cream and sugar. Comfy beds. Plenty of linens. Two TVs. There was nothing we lacked for our stay. She even decorated for Christmas which we appreciated as we had to be traveling at that time."

Stayed with kids","We were in town for a wedding. This house was amazing! It was very spacious. You didn’t feel right on top of each other and you could get up and not wake anyone else up with the multiple common areas. Which was nice with two babies! We spent most our time in this adorable sun room! The house we very clean! The host has thought of everything! I was really worried about finding a house in a safe area it’s hard to read multiple reviews to know about the location! I went to college in Spartanburg and know not areas are nice but this house was in a beautiful, safe, and confidently located area! Would definitely stay here again!"

Group trip",Debbie's Charming house is aptly described to a tee! The six of us were very very comfortable over Thanksgiving weekend. My dog absolutely loved the nearby Dog Park and having grown up in Spartanburg I enjoyed walking my old neighborhood routes and being across from the elementary school I attended wayyy back! The sunroom was the best gathering spot for being together. We hardy turned on the TV and just enjoyed being together with family. I recommend this property highly and will definitely hope for another stay in this AirB&B!

Stayed with a pet","Honest representation of an ideal rental for a family with pets. The home is in an established neighborhood with mature foliage/trees. Immediate residents (neighbors next door/across the street) are friendly and welcoming. Walking distance to a Starbucks (literally 50m from the home) and grocery store/premier German restaurant (1.2 miles). Well maintained, no odor of pets and a large, fenced backyard.
Minor concerns:
- Road in front of the house (near restaurant/Starbucks) was closed/under construction on a select portion. Not unbearably noisy during the day and absolutely quiet at night.
- The neighborhood is abundant with large dogs. All the dogs are controlled within a fenced area; when walking the neighborhood you will be “announced”. 😊😊 Neighbors have two large dogs. I was worried as one of my dogs is dog aggressive; she showed no sign of aggression towards the neighbor’s dogs. Simply annotating for owners of dogs with anxiety/aggression issues."

Stayed with a pet","We actually live in town, but had to vacate our home while our crawlspace was being worked on. Leaving our home, yet not being on vacation, was not very exciting to the wife and kids. Anytime you are uprooted, it is stressful for the family. Every place we were trying to stay - whether with family, or our church, fell through. Found this new townhome on Airbnb, and I can’t express how grateful we were to have discovered Natalia and her home. To have a place all to ourselves, with close proximity to Target, Costco, and a bunch of restaurants… incredible. We were very much at home. Relaxed. And when we needed to extend our stay, because the work was taking longer than expected on our home, it was no problem at all! It was honestly perfect. Can’t give enough stars. We are very, very grateful!"

The bed and pillows were super comfortable, and the bedrooms were dark and quiet, so that we slept well. Enjoyed hanging out and catching up with my daughter in this space. We cooked dinner together, talked and watched a movie. We both had our own room and bathroom. Way better than just a hotel room. We both agreed that we could live in that loft!
I very much appreciated the host providing coffee. (I brought creamer from home...but that might be a nice added touch to have for future guests) There were all the kitchen basics we needed to cook dinner, even olive oil.
The only thing about the listing that was not accurate, was that there were not the bathrobes as advertised. (First world problem, I know, but I was still a little bummed) I let the host know, and he said he would update the listing.
We really enjoyed our stay."

Group trip","Morgan and Elizabeth were great to work with. There were a couple of glitches at the start but they did their best to rectify the situation (for example....there were 5 women staying in the loft but only 4 towels, 4 cups, 4 forks, etc.) Additional supplies were delivered to us as soon as possible. The loft was very comfortable, and we loved the nearby train. There is no coffee pot other than a pour over. Had never used one before but quickly adapted and pleasantly surprised with the coffee quality. Not ready to get rid of my plug in but glad to have another coffee option! A couple of suggestions for the future....add a couple of night lights in the bathrooms, increase number of towels available, include small sheets and blanket for sofa. Overall, we five were comfortable and pleased with our stay. Thank you."

The place and area is very peaceful, clean, comfortable, & overall beautiful. Definitely would recommend the third floor airbnb loft was there last time and it was also beautiful. Cleaning could have been done better before I checked in, but I understand it wasn’t the host’s fault it was the cleaner’s mistake. Besides that I honestly enjoyed my stay will definitely come again!!😇💞"

It was only about 20 min away from the show we were going to at Bon Secours. There is a Dollar General right near the place to pop over and get anything you may need. We had a great time at the pool. Falls Park on the Reedy is a great place to check out while you’re there. It’s gorgeous and only about a 30 min drive. The space was unique and very clean. Would definitely stay here again.

There aren’t really any stores or restaurants within walking distance except a dollar general. It is definitely more of an industrial area but very close driving distance to everything. It is not an inconvenient location. Also, this was stated in the description of the property so it was not a surprise. I would stay there again! Morgan was very helpful!"

Stayed a few nights","Inside was really, really nice...the high ceilings and overall aesthetics were just as described. There's only one elevator, on the other side of the building, so the stairs are where you'll likely have to walk and there are a lot of them, so tough when you're bringing your things up or down plus parking is not close tot he entrance - so overall just a lot of walking. Most everything was great - and this is no fault of Morgan - but there is a constant smell of marijuana in the hallway. This is on management, but it's not pleasant and just takes away from the beauty of this place. The furniture and beds are very comfortable and although we didn't use them, the washer/dryer are a nice amenity. There were some unfolded (used?) blankets in the main closet, so not sure if they were clean. The air mattress was perfect for my teenager and all in all we had a nice stay."

The only complaint I have is security was called to our room for a noise complaint. There is a curfew which we respected but there were only 4 people in our loft and we were sitting on the couch watching music videos on the TV. I didn’t think it was that loud but noise must carry through that building. Nonetheless we would recommend this place to others.

The guest suite looked out to a beautiful backyard and peaceful lake. Guest suite was clean and tidy. Owners were friendly and helpful. I highly recommend staying here. Thanks."

Stayed with a pet","We had a great stay. It rained our entire visit, so we didn’t get to enjoy the outdoors but it is a lovely property and in a great/safe location. If you plan to bring dogs, know that the owners share the backyard with their own dog (we didn’t have any issues, but something to be mindful of) and there is a door connecting the private suite to the main house (there is a latch on your side of the door, but worth documenting). Great price for the stay."

Stayed with a pet","Host was initially very responsive, but when I reached out inquiring about her dog being outside, I heard nothing back. The reason this matters is because prior to finalizing booking, I asked if we could bring our dog, who is extremely reactive, to which she answered yes. If I hadn’t noticed her dog in the back yard and let me dog off leash, we could have had a very dangerous situation.
Beyond that, the toilet was gross, and there was hair ball in the tub drain. Not worth what we paid for, will definitely not be returning for the lack of cleanliness and lack of consideration."

Stayed a few nights","I selected this Kathryn's place since it was pet friendly and close to my Aunt's house for Thanksgiving. On arrival, I was unsure I was at the correct location, but G-maps (the site won't let me spell out the browser name) will get you there and I made it safe and sound. On a side note, there was a pet fee that was added on the day of my arrival that I did not know about prior to the trip. Kathryn cut the fee in half, but as a girl on a budget, I would have considered this fee when I was selecting locations. Overall, it was a good stay, close to my Aunt's house and a back yard for the dog to run around, and a safe neighborhood for walking. They were patient with my barking puppy too."

We brought our own, but there are towels by the door and a hair dryer under the sink. Also, we brought our own hand vacuum to help with the pet hair as one was not readily available for our stay.

All amenities and appliances were top of the line. The porch was lovely, and the neighborhood is quiet. We were never more than 5-8 minutes drive from anything we wanted to do.
The train does come through at night but we were not bothered as a group of six. It seems to come through all parts of Spartanburg though.
The only thing missing are some lamps in the bedrooms for reading at night—otherwise a flawless destination for all of your needs!"

Stayed a few nights","First, the positives: the house itself is a sight to behold, boasting exquisite finishes and thoughtful personal touches that added warmth to our stay. The bathrooms and kitchen were well-equipped with all the essentials, and the beds were incredibly comfortable, providing a cozy retreat at the end of a long day.
However, our experience was marred by one significant downside – the incessant noise from the nearby train line. Despite the allure of the comfortable beds, we found it nearly impossible to get any rest due to the trains passing by roughly once an hour throughout the night. The disruption to our sleep left us feeling less than refreshed and somewhat disappointed.
While Ivan's home is undeniably beautiful and well-appointed, the constant noise from the train line significantly detracted from our overall enjoyment. For future guests, come prepared with earplugs or noise-canceling headphones in order to mitigate the impact on sleep quality."

We enjoyed every bit of it and never wanted to leave the house, which is perfectly renovated as if something you would see in a magazine.. Ivan’s house felt very cozy and inviting. All the mattresses were super comfortable with high-end linen and very soft comforters. I specially enjoyed my early mornings on the back porch with my perfect coffee made by the fanciest coffee machine I have seen. My wife enjoyed cooking in the gourmet kitchen, which includes anything and everything from a mixer to a blender all the pots and pans necessary to create any dish and plenty of dinnerware for all. We were amazed at the variety of spices and teas that were included not to mention raw honey and even gourmet hot chocolate for the kids. With all the available amenities, it seemed like Ivan specifically tailored this house for our needs. We will definitel"

I loved the fact that there’s an on-site new washer and dryer and a space to work remotely with printer, just bring your laptop. To top it off, enjoy a delicious espresso (or latte-just bring your raw milk 🤣) as soon as you wake up or anytime the desire hits! There’s a few varieties of nice teas and hot chocolate.
Host Ivan is amazing!!! He responded within mere seconds and was there with recommendations and answers to our questions. Definitely worth the stay and will be back soon 🥰 We highly recommend this place!!!"

Stayed a few nights","This location was a good value. The property manager was very nice and helpful. This location is right downtown in the busy part of the square. It was fun to walk out the front door and right into Music on Main. Beware that on Thursdays, parking is very difficult due to Music on Main. I was not prepared to hunt for a space quite a ways away from the condo after working all day. The bed was comfortable but outside noise is very loud, bring a sound machine. This airbnb is a great value but be prepared for the noise and the parking. It is a cute space!"

Stayed a few nights","Great place! Very convenient with 24 parking lot right across the street & so many walkable restaurants. Loved that the square was right outside the building! The apartment looked just like the pictures- loved the exposed brick! Very spacious yet cozy. A couple things I will add but wouldn’t be things I would “dock” per say are that if you can’t do stairs this isn’t the place for you. Was fine for us but just be sure you know prior to booking. Also you are right downtown so there’s lots of “city noise” (cars, sirens, construction work, etc). If you are used to that then not a problem. We live in the middle of nowhere so that was an adjustment for us. Just bring your own noise machine or phone app & you’ll be fine! But just keep in mind. But other than those things it’s a great spot & we would stay again!"

If you are wanting to be near local restaurants and in a walkable area, this is a great spot.
I took off one star because the place could use a really thorough cleaning. Perhaps the carpet and furniture cleaned would make it a bit more comfortable. But still a great stay!"

It was beautiful in photographs (we used the space to get ready for my wedding day). I would just recommend not checking in late at night as the entrance is an a dark alleyway looking area. We did however feel very safe as the doors to get into the building were locked at all times and needed a code to gain access. There were also about 30 stairs to get to the apartment which was not at all a problem for us but something to keep in mind. I would absolutely recommend this space and would stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","Was visiting our son at Wofford. This was our first stay with Anna, and we will hope to stay with her every visit to Spartanburg! This spot is a hidden gem, indeed! Both comfortable, and charming, and the location could not be any better if you really want to experience downtown Spartanburg! After a long drive, we walked out the front door to a magical night of dining (SO many spots to choose from) with live music on the street - it was perfect! Just what we needed to recharge our batteries!
The added beauty is inside we never heard anything and you would not know you were in the middle of a bustling downtown scene!
Anna was responsive to questions I had before the visit and was an excellent host! Couldn't recommend this spot more strongly if you like charm and historic character!"

We love being able to come and go and easily walk to restaurants, shopping, etc. This time, it was even more exciting with food trucks, bands, crafts, activities, etc. Even without a big festival, this loft is in the middle of the action in a town with a vibrant, alive downtown! Inside, Taylor offers a comfy bed, a stylish decor, and a relaxing environment. Can't wait to come back!"

Stayed about a week","My first visit to Spartanburg and I loved this space! Very well situated in downtown area ...walking distance to shops, restaurants, Starbucks, and live music. Apartment is in a vintage building, up one long flight of stairs from sidewalk--two large rooms, nicely decorated, comfortable furniture. Music and nightlife is audible in the evening, but at the end, lulled me to sleep. It was cold when I visited, so it was nice to have control of the heat, and it functioned well. There seems to be parking available in the back, but it is small and shared at times by many people because of the nightlife. 2 hr. free parking on the street out front..I had access to both front and back which was convenient
The one bathroom is clean and nicely done- on the small side w shower and tub. Its shared by a hallway between the two rooms: The bedroom has a comfortable Kingsize bed with nice linens. The other room holds the kitchen and a small table and 2 chairs--I would not try to cook a meal; not enough seating or complete dish ware--restaurants or takeout the better choice...the other side of the open air room has an oversized comfy chair w pullout twin size mattress, and a large plush velvet sofa and TV. Apartment seems like a perfect size for 1, 2 or 3 people. Even 4 if necessary, as there is an air mattress available...I called the host, with questions, 3 different times and heard back from him within 20 minutes each time. I would visit again!"

Just to note the apartment is located above an Irish Pub that has live music on the weekends that can be heard from the apartment. I was there for work so looking for a quite place to go to bed early and rise early so not so ideal but had I been there for leisure would not have been such an issue. Other than that it is wonderful and Taylor is the perfect host!"

The apartment is located in the heart of the quaint historical district, surrounded by two pubs, a classy Italian restaurant, and a great little Creperie. Taylor met us in person, showed us where to unload our suitcases, and recommended some breakfast spots. The apartment had every amenity you could need, including a full-size fridge and stove, and keurig for all coffee drinkers. We were in town for a wedding, and found our selves in the perfect halfway point between church and reception. Thank you, Taylor, for your hospitality and the sweet touches you put into your place."

Cons: Delaney's Pub next door had very loud music one night until 1:00 am.
The shower head in the bathroom was less than ideal.
The back entrance is dumpster adjacent.

But the downside is the next door business get roudy at times playing loud music and there's some traffic but it stops early enough since its not NYC. The super comfy couch and blankets made up for it. The TV didn't really work but then again, TV is all crap! Super nice friendly neighbors. I would love to come again in the end! Great spot!"

My daughter and her husband recently moved to the neighborhood, so it was so convenient to spend time with them and to walk to restaurants downtown.

Jawaan was super responsive, helpful and friendly.
I'd also flag, which I didn't pay attention to because I'd previously been staying in another rental previously so I had a lot of things with me, but Jawaan has this perfectly set up for long & short term stays. The kitchen in particular felt like a kitchen I could really cook in without having to buy a bunch of stuff to make it feasible. Definitely helped with the 'walk right in' feel to the whole place.
It's very quiet & clean, and I'll definitely look into booking again.
Like everyone else, I'll say that the driveway is very steep & a bit narrow, but with my back-up camera I didn't have any issues."

Stayed a few nights","Enjoyed my stay very much. The house was loaded with everything you could ever need or think of. Very clean and the host was helpful and responsive. The only thing that stood out was the driveway. It was very narrow with retaining walls on each side so it’s a very tight squeeze. The only other Parking is on the side walk if you’re car can be parked on sidewalk (mine cant) Very happy I did not bring my lifted truck because that would have been near impossible to maneuver in the area. Overall, the house was exactly what we wanted for the weekend."

It was very clean. There was so much attention to detail, including well appointed decor, comfy bedding and definitely an exceptionally well equipped kitchen. There was not a thing we wanted or needed while we were here except our own groceries. The BBQ grill and washer & dryer were great bonuses. Red Door is located in a quiet and safe neighborhood within walking distance of downtown. We are happy to give a 5 star review and wish we could give more. If ever we are back in this area, we will definitely be booking with Jawaan again."

Stayed a few nights","Amandela's Bohemian Loft is a spacious and beautiful loft apartment in a nice neighborhood. We were in Spartanburg for a conference and it was just a four-minute drive to downtown where the conference was being held. We had off-street parking with a well-lit stairway to the loft. The air-conditioned space was a welcome respite after a busy day and the huge shower was really nice. The wood flooring is gorgeous, the decor is clean and modern. The lighting is a little tricky to figure out as many are on the same circuit with the switches located near the kitchen. The bed was firm but comfortable. If you like white noise, bring a small fan as the ceiling fan is on the same circuit as the bedroom area light and cannot be left on separately. Our only note would be to lower the bedside shelves so they can be reached easily from the bed and have a light next to the bed that can be turned off from the bed. I would definitely stay here again, it was lovely!"

It was a perfect size for my teenage son, my young adult daughter, and myself. Amandela provided lovely amenities. The location was great for a quick trip to drop my son off for camp each morning at VCOM. My daughter and I loved exploring Spartenburg while he was at camp. The downtown was delightful and there were so many things for us to do. This was my very first Airbnb experience so I had nothing to compare our stay to, but my daughter has used Airbnb many times. She said that Amendela's loft was top notch! I would happily stay with her again if we are in the area."

Even got a mani done 😆
If you ever need any Salon or Esthetician services done make sure to go to Kenneth Shuler and ask for Sabrina! The service and product discounts there are amazing as well!
I definitely enjoyed my stay and if I can get the time off from work, I’ll be booking again next month‼️

We wondered if it would be too small and cramped. Just the opposite! It is very spacious and beautifully decorated.
We had everything we needed and were very comfortable staying there.
The bed was great! Which we truly appreciate. You just never know what you are gonna get and a good night’s sleep is priceless!!
Thank you for everything!!
We highly recommend the Bohemian studio and hope to return ourselves!
The only hitch we had was
the AC quit while we were there, but Amandela generously offered to put us up at the AC Hotel!! We declined. Being Oct, the weather was mild and we were gone most of the time, as we were in town for a family reunion.
Instead I suggested a couple of fans might be nice in the evening. She had 2 large box fans delivered right away. We did use one, and that made us perfectly comfortable. They had an AC Repair man scheduled for the day we left. Very efficient!
The personal attention and generous offer of a hotel room was greatly appreciated.
Great property and great host! We will gladly return!"

Stayed a few nights","Clean, functional, and stylish. Ample room and amenities for a night or a week, with the full kitchen and washer/dryer. The oak floors are beautiful. Comfortable queen bed, and a double-reclining sofa that I'm glad we don't have - we would be in it way too much. The shower is one of the more enjoyable ones I've ever used; large, and with good ventilation.
Give the A/C time to catch up if the day is very warm. We set it to the temperature we wanted, went out to dinner, and when we got back it was up-to-speed. Note that this is a walk up (in the attic space of a one-story building) so be prepared for the equivalent of two flights of stairs.
The Loft is about a mile from the trendy part of town, which has a nice evening vibe. Parking is not hard to find (at least during the week when we were there). I recommend the Loft."

All the comforts of home with a great shower, kitchen area, bedroom and we especially loved the sofa with duel recliners! Very special place! The outdoor lighting along the entrance was especially nice after dark."

Stayed a few nights","Loved this spot. I visited to hang out with my son who lives in the area for a few days. Both of us loved the loft. Cozy spot equipped with everything you need. It felt like a home away from home. I plan to try to stay here for every subsequent visit to Spartanburg if Amandela will allow. Literally 1 minute away from the downtown area, which is a great spot for food and entertainment.
The only issue initially was pinpointing exactly where it is. The address takes you to a commercial business establishment. The loft itself is around the building and up the stairs. But we figured that out pretty quickly. Highly recommend."

Stayed with kids",We were in town for a wedding and wanted to be able to walk and do things with our kids. This place is across the street from a playground and we would end the night getting ice cream. We would also walk to get dinner. There is some noise down by the street at night/early morning so I had to purchase some earplugs so I could sleep. But other than that it was very cool place to stay. We could easily fit 4 kids in bedroom with plenty of space and loved having 2.5 baths. Loved the balcony in the back as well. The place is very clean and easily could make meals in the kitchen. Recommend staying here if you want to enjoy a cute little town.

With it being downtown there was obviously some noise but nothing extremely noticeable. Beds were super comfortable and shower felt so nice! Would recommend again!"

It was just a couple of blocks from the venue and was very spacious. We had plenty of room for the bridal party(6), moms(2) and 2 hair/makeup ladies. The natural light from the rooms was absolutely perfect! This is the cutest place and super clean. Emily stayed in contact with me throughout the entire booking. As we got close to our check in date, there was a little confusion (my fault). Emily called me to clarify rather than messaging back and forth, which I thought was top notch customer service, because you can't tell tone or intent over messages. She was so polite and accommodating. I would definitely recommend staying here if you are out of town or if you are a bridal party looking for a place to get ready the day of your wedding. The photos in front of the brick windows are amazing!"

Steps away from restaurants, a great coffee shop, a playground, live music, an old fashioned drug store, and Main Street shops. The place has tons of charm, a huge kitchen and a great outdoor seating area. We will definitely be back!"

Plenty of seating and roomy. It is a nice lofty space with historical appeal and all the amenities you may need. We didn’t get to enjoy the lovely second floor patio, but it’s a beautiful bonus."

I saw the photos and thought oh what a nice, decent sized place. Then, we go there and walked in. Wow. The rooms were twice the size of the photos. The terrace was so nice, and they thought of everything. There was water in the fridge, coffee supplied, laundry detergent and sheets provided. The beds were super comfortable. The closets were huge, and loved having makeup desks with a chair and mirror in each bedroom. The huge windows provided great lighting, and it was absolutely wonderful having 2.5 bathrooms with myself and my 2 daughters staying here. Communication was easy and great, Emily even texted when the alarm company alerted her that the front door wasnt closed fully. There was the cutest ice cream shop next door, a playground across the street, and a coffee shop next door. Everything you could need within walking distance. I loved this place,and will definitely book the next time we visit here. 10 stars!!!"

In addition, she provides a great guide to Spartanburg. The location of the apartment is amazing - right in the heart of downtown next to restaurants, ice cream shops, coffee shops, and boutiques. When we checked in, there was a small issue with the lock but Emily quickly reset it remotely and was available via phone or text to help us out. The place itself is STUNNING - high ceilings, a ton of natural light, the bedrooms are spacious, and the deck out back is nice to take your morning coffee. My colleague and I are so happy we chose to stay here instead of a hotel chain somewhere across town. We will be back again!!"

The place is beautifully decorated and clean. Incredibly comfortable and tons of cute shops/eateries in walking distance. 10/10 reccomend! Will stay here again.

Stayed one night",We were only there for one night and could have stayed much longer. It was beautifully decorated. Just be aware that there are a flight of stairs from street to living area and another flight to the bedrooms. But the house was just like pictured. The back bedroom had wonderful blackening draperies and was very quiet. The front bedroom had privacy draperies but the street lights shone through and had some street sounds. So put your lighter sleepers in the back room. We hope to use Emily’s place again in the future

Stayed a few nights","We very much enjoyed our time in Emily's ""cool"" downtown apartment! The decor was minimalist, industrial, and chic all at the same time!
We had everything we needed and Emily gave us exceptional attention!
Thanks for sharing your home Emily!"

Stayed a few nights","THIS IS A JEWEL!!!! Our initial booking turned out to be a disaster; so we had to pivot, and found THIS!!!! The host was very kind and super attentive to us. She’s created a space that’s perfect for couples, families, buddies, business, fun, or just relaxing. Lots of great places to eat around; it’s located in the heart of downtown. Parking is a little tricky, but doesn’t take away from the experience. THIS IS A WINNER FOR SURE! Thanks for such a great stay."

Stayed a few nights","There aren't adequate superlatives to describe The Suite on Main and Emily's thoughtfulness. The location is superb, and the apartment is spacious, spotless and tastefully decorated. Our family thoroughly enjoyed everything about our stay there during our daughter's Wofford College graduation weekend. Our son remarked that these were our best accommodations ever, and he's right! Emily was remarkably responsive and accommodating -- we can't thank her enough for her graciousness. I highly recommend her place as the best in the Spartanburg region."

Stayed one night","Emily's place is a hidden gem! Words cannot express how amazing, clean and comfortable this place is. Pictures does this place no justice! Planned a little staycation getaway for me and my love for Valentine's and it was the most romantic and soothing getaway. Close to downtown, walking distance from local restaurants, bars and the view was very calming and peaceful. I HIGHLY recommend Emily's place. You will not regret not one moment. Emily was awesome, easy to get in touch with, even had cold beverages available upon arrival. Definitely will be staying again!"
