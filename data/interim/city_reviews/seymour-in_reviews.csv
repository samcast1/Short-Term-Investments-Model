We will definitely stay here again when we’re in the area."

We really appreciated all the little details like everything being labeled and a fully stocked kitchen and bathroom. The pool and fire pit were an added bonus and made for such a fun girls weekend! Close enough to Brown County for a day trip to Nashville for shopping and site seeing."

Stayed a few nights","Rent this place last year and loved it so much I came back again this year. It is a peaceful little place out in the country and has its own pool. A great escape for a girl's trip and about 20 minutes from Columbus, Indiana. She has practically everything furnished in the place that you would normally have in your own home. People, this place is the best place to rent if you are traveling or just need a home away from home for a short vacation. If Rhonda the host of this property had other ones to rent I would only rent from her. Thanks for everything."

Stayed with kids","We really enjoyed our quick getaway. The property was exactly as described. We had some internet issues, but we expected that ahead of time based on the listing. Everything was clean and helpfully labeled. The pool was fenced in and kept covered. What stood out most to me was that it seemed pretty kid/family friendly. The outlets had covers on them, the pool was fenced in and had a cover, there were board games and kids’ movies available. The pool isn’t deep either which is nice and there are some pool toys available. We had our 16 month old with us so we loved that. Check in and out instructions were clear, Miss Rhonda was friendly and came down to introduce herself and chat for a minute, and we had lots of visits from friendly farm cat Sookie. They even had treats ready in case you wanted to spoil any of the furry visitors- we totally did. This place was exactly what we were looking for and we’ll definitely come stay again sometime!!"

Stayed a few nights","Rhonda is an AMAZING hostess! From the whimsical ""rules"" book to the labels on all switches so you know what goes to what; from the clean, cozy environment to the little thoughtful touches like snacks, she has done a great job of making you feel truly ""at home""!
Plenty of blankets, pillows, kitchen stocked with plenty of cooking and serving dishes-- just can't say enough! There is a huge tv with a dvd player-- worked great for us to watch a marriage series we brought along. We had planned to go hiking at Brown County but the weather didn't cooperate-- I couldn't think of a better place to hang out!
Cracker Barrel in Seymour is just 15ish minutes away, an easy drive. Rhonda's place was easy to get to. The dog and cat visited us as we were bringing things in but weren't a nuisance at all. We live on a mini-farm so we appreciated their being friendly and allowing a little petting! :)
I highly recommend staying here and would plan to again if we are ever down this way!"

Stayed a few nights","WOW, that pretty much sums it up. Beautiful little place with all the comforts of home. So clean, quiet, comfortable and so spacious. Was the perfect 4 day get away for my husband and I to just relax and decompress. Rhonda is a A++ hostess. Her attention to all the details, large and small made this such a warm, welcoming experience. She has definitely set the bar high. We can't wait to come back during the summer to enjoy the pool. We enjoyed sitting out and enjoying the past few warm fall evenings. Loved the friendly little Kitties that welcomed us every morning out on the patio. I would highly recommend to anyone, you will not be disappointed."

There is a significant amount of interstate noise, but this did not detour from our stay. The Wi-Fi is spotty, but she is clear on this point in the description and we were not there to watch TV anyway!
My son is it IU Bloomington and we will definitely be back to stay and play at this very nice Airbnb!

There were only two of us this time and we had plenty of space. Huge flat screen TV. Very clean, had everything supplied for people to use in the kitchen and bathroom/laundry area's. Pool was beautiful and very clean. Animal lovers will enjoy the cats and the one dog that is on the adjoining property. Rhonda, the host of this property is very nice and will help with anything you need if you contact her. Will definitely come back here to stay again. It was only about a thirty minute drive to Nashville. Highly recommend this place to anyone."

The laundry room, shower, and bathroom could be closed off with a pocket door and was also large. We had the pool all to ourselves. That was an unexpected bonus. She had everything including the beach towels, floats, and toys for the pool. This was a total home run!"

We found out about Green Haven from a couple at one of the wineries and once we contacted Darci, everything went smoothly and we were able to get in right away. The place was fabulous! I don’t think Darci forgot one detail! Amenities and supplies were above and beyond what I have found at other places we have stayed. Decor was outstanding and it was very clean! We will recommend to our friends and family, if they need a place to stay in Seymour."

Stayed with kids","The thought and love that has gone into Darci’s place is obvious from the moment we entered. It’s comfortable, beautiful, and immaculate. (Not to mention fun - our teens and tween loved everything from the coffee bar to the spiral stairs)! We came into town after dark, and as we parked on the street below, the lights in the apartment above were shining warmly and a Christmas tree was lit in the window. Everything about our experience communicated welcome.
Check in/out was simple, we felt safe and secure, and our only regret was that we were just there overnight. We would have loved to have had time to explore downtown and relax longer in this lovely space. As book lovers with a couple gluten free members, we were thrilled to see a bookstore with a gluten free cafe right across the street. Alas, both businesses are closed on Sundays, so we missed out on that, but we hope to be back to stay longer when we are traveling through again. Darci is friendly, accommodating, and responsive."

Stayed a few nights","One of the best air bnbs I’ve ever stayed at, hands down. Not only is Darci’s place trendy and beautiful (love all the plants and decor and the finishes) it is also amazingly welcoming and comfortable. I appreciate all the little details included - the toiletries for the “oops I forgot to pack that” instances, snacks in the kitchen, and that fully stocked coffee bar. Darci was responsive to my messages both before my trip and throughout my stay, giving me recommendations fitting to my interests. She’s an incredible host.
Darci’s place is a gem and was perfect for my long weekend trip to Seymour. I will definitely be staying here again. I couldn’t imagine staying any place better!"

The home is full of character, charm, and modern amenities, the ad is great but doesn't do this home justice! I think Darci thought of everything and this was by far the simplest checkout I've ever experienced at an AirBnb. If I'm ever needing to visit this area again, I would most definitely return, thank you for an incredible stay, Darci !"

We could people watch out the front, sit on the patio and listen to music, or watch TV and relax. Even if the festivities weren't going on there are many downtown spots to eat and a little park to go to within walking distance. I didn't want to leave!"

The location is perfect, as there are so many shops downtown to walk through. Even if you don’t leave, there’s plenty to do here (you’ll want to call dibs on the couch)! We loved that there were games, a coffee bar, and the balcony/patio was so cozy!! We never even turned on the TV’s. Even if you don’t need a shower, take one anyway…that master bath is to die for! We are already planning our next stay! Darci, thank you for such an incredible experience! You are THEE BEST!"

Stayed with a pet","Tom's place was a very comfortable home for our mini-family reunion of adult siblings and spouses. The view was amazing and the smells of nature envelope you. The main deck was our venue of choice where we grilled steaks and enjoyed each other's company.
Each of the 3 couples had a level of their own with their own bathroom as well. So privacy was there when needed, but plenty of time for togetherness. The house itself has everything you could imagine needing and then some. The massage chair - big bonus. And the homemade cookies upon arrival - nice touch- Yum!
Tom was quick to respond and help when he could, which was so appreciated. It was very clear our comfortable and successful stay was a priority to him."

Group trip","This was my first experience with Evolve and it will be my last. I am a guest, but also a host with airbnb and I was very disappointed with several items with this booking. Upon arrival, we couldn't get into the house with the code that should have been set up for our booking. After multiple attempts the owner contacted us back and sent a neighbor over to let us in and give us a code that wasn't as per the directions in the listing and this neighbor also knew our code which to me was a risk. We did not know this person to trust them. Upon entering we found multiple personal items in the home, including a used razor in the bathroom and medications in the fridge and bathroom. I contacted Evolve regarding my concerns, including cleanliness, sanitation, and safety, I was told that I would not get a refund without a full investigation and if I felt unsafe to call the police. This has never been an airbnb type of response. I am very dissatisfied."

Very beautiful and serene river views. Lots of decks for outdoor enjoyment. It was well kept and the massage chair downstairs quickly became everyone in our groups favorite thing! It was perfect having bedrooms and full bathrooms on all 3 floors. There are a couple of great state parks nearby and the town of Vernon and North Vernon are both very quaint and fun to look around in. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will likely book again in warmer weather! Thanks again Tom for your hospitality and kindness.

Stayed a few nights","Tony's apartment was perfect for our 2 night stay. Built in 1854, it has been beautifully renovated. It is close to the main downtown area, library, visitor's center and many of the popular architectural sites. Very clean, easy parking, quiet (except for the garbage trucks in the wee hours). Very walkable to lots of points of interest. Tony was quick to respond to my question.
Abundant coffee pod choices and bottled water in the fridge were a welcome touch.
The stairs to this 2nd floor unit are quite steep, which wasn't a problem for us, but some may need to consider. The comfort of the couch left a lot to be desired (it is the only upholstered furniture in the unit), but we were so busy exploring, we didn't use the couch much.
Overall a lovely place to stay and a beautiful, walkable and interesting town."

We couldn’t sleep well because we could hear music from the Dairy Queen outdoor speakers, some annoying machines that I’m guessing were the AC units, cars and not to mention a garbage truck scraping and dropping dumpsters at 4:00am. The bedroom didn’t have a fan or good AC flow. It would be freezing in the living room but no air coming in the bedroom register. It was decorated so nice and super clean. The host was super nice and friendly. Easy booking and getting in. All the lights in the unit were the LED bluish color which I hate. The warm yellow lighting would feel so much more inviting and cozy. It was a great rental but not the best for a light sleeper."

Couldn’t really ask for a better location to stay. Parking was easy and convenient to major roads to explore greater Columbus. The place had everything we needed. Bed was comfortable. The listing is accurate and host was easy to reach and quick to answer any questions.

We had everything we needed - the bottled water was great, and there were plenty of teas and Keurig pods. The location was awesome... a quick walk to the center of town. My friend and I were coming from two different directions and had two cars; both the dedicated parking spot and on-sreet parking were easy. Tony was friendly and fast in his communications. The shower is a little slow to heat up, but it does get hot - so leave a few extra minutes for that and don't panic if it seems cold at first. I appreciated being able to check in and out by ourselves, and the lock was easy to use. Would stay here again if I return!"

Even with the in- town location, it was very quiet, safe, and peaceful. We easily were able to walk for coffee and to the Visitor’s Center. Tony was very responsive and communication was great.
Would definitely want to stay again if we are in the area!"

Stayed one night","The wife and I stayed here over the Fourth holiday. We like Columbus but were disappointed that some of our favorite downtown restaurants did not survive the pandemic.
As 4th street is under construction, you have to enter from 3rd as of this posting. Also if you have mobility issues, realize that you must walk through gravel to get from the parking space to the sidewalk and again to get to the front porch. The inside steps are very steep and narrow to the 2nd floor apartment.
The apartment itself is smartly decorated and very clean. The bed has a comfortable, fairly firm mattress. The kitchen is well supplied and included complimentary cold bottled water. The shower has good water pressure, but it takes a very long time for the hot water to reach it. There is no bedroom TV, but the living room has a nice large one that is easily viewed from the couch.
The A/C was able to keep up with the 90 degree weather.
The host was lightning fast in replying to our texts. He was very helpful and accommodating. This is an excellent rental if you plan to stay in the downtown area and would like a nice, roomy space and don't want to pay the prices at Hotel Indigo."

Many rental spaces fail to strike the right balance between being well stocked with amenities and pleasing decorations and having sufficient space for the renters' ""stuff."" A kitchen shouldn't be so crammed with cooking/serving gear that there is no space for a renter's groceries, but neither should the cupboards and fridge be bare of helpful supplies. Jennifer's place was frankly perfect. It was cute, comfortable, and accommodating, offering thoughtful supplies and comforts but still leaving plenty of space to enable us to settle in and feel at home. The lighting was good, the beds and bedding comfy, the electric outlets convenient, the window treatments offering good privacy, and the overall feeling very safe and secure. Big thumbs up!

Stayed with kids","Was a great place to explore Columbus and Nashville! If you have toddlers and kids this is a great find, Jennifer has thought of everything from a baby sling, booster seat, kids plates and cups, toy chest, lots of books and games. My kids were entertained the whole time and kept wanting to go back to play at the house! Great indoor playground at The Commons close by and Lucabe has amazing coffee and also a play area for kids that’s 2 min away. We’d definitely stay again if we visit the area!"

The property matches the description exactly, no surprises.
The place is adorable inside and has everything you need.
The kitchen is well stocked to cook meals if you want to.
The bathroom (water pressure, overall condition) was great.
The space was clean and I felt safe and cozy.
The host was friendly and responsive.
You are close to everything (Target, food, gas), but tucked away.
I would absolutely book this place again in the future.
Thank you for sharing your place!"

There are loads of towels and hot water and bedding, the kitchen basics you need, a washer and drier, a little dining nook, and off-street parking in this safe residential neighborhood. Some special touches: TVs in each of the bedrooms, in addition to the big living room TV, and a collection of board games if you prefer not to watch TV. The front porch features a nice porch swing! The street traffic outside is a bit busy at evening rush hour but the rest of the time is light and unobstrusive. We are very glad we stayed in this relaxing home and we recommend it highly."

The home was very clean and was just like being at home. We loved everything about our stay, and really appreciated Anna's recommendations and communication.
Loved walking to downtown Vernon for dinner at Los Alamos and the very short drive to North Vernon for ice cream and a movie at the Park Theatre Civic Center.
Would love to come back and stay for a long weekend and explore and hike at Muscatatuck and highly recommend Anna's home!"

Stayed with kids","We had a lovely stay at Anna's place! Everything was as expected and as pictured. We came in town for the eclipse and Anna went out of her way to make sure we knew about local events, road barricades, etc. She also made sure we had everything we needed - even offering us eclipse glasses and proactively leaving sunscreen at the house because it was hot and sunny that day. Seriously, the best host! The house had everything we needed, was very clean, and very spacious. I do want to note that the floors upstairs are creaky, which is completely typical of an old house, but may be helpful to know if you have small children or light sleepers in your group. We thoroughly enjoyed the patio space and several other green spaces within walking distance (including a playground). It was a charming town. I can also recommend the mexican restaurant you can walk to around the corner and Hos coffee in North Vernon, as well as North Vernon City Park - all great!"

Stayed a few nights","Describing this cabin in just one word would be impossible. Here are just a few of the ways I would describe National Hoosier Hideaway. Adorable, homey, relaxing, peaceful, secluded, welcoming, paradise in the woods. Ok, so that was three words but it is only a short list of characteristics that you can expect at NHH. Marisa was a great hostess to work with she answered any questions or requests we had promptly which was great. Using a GPS brought us right to the front door without any issues. The entry code worked flawlessly and easy. The interior of the cabin was very nicely decorated and instantly made you feel welcomed. The hot tub was amazing using it on a cool night and enjoying the sounds of nature. The bottle of wine and bunt cake was an unexpected surprise that just added to our wonderful weekend getaway. If you are looking for a nice getaway where you can enjoy some peace qnd quiet I highly recommend Hoosier National Hideaway.
Thank you Marisa for everything.
God bless"

The kitchen is fully stocked with cookware, utensils and any seasoning you could ever want, plus a great coffee and hot cocoa selection of k cups. The back deck is the best part! The hot tub was so awesome, I loved it. All in all 10 out of 10, I’d recommend it to anyone who was looking for a peaceful getaway to relax and unwind."

The seasonal decor was a nice touch as well - not many places do that."

We were so pleased with the clean and surprisingly nice bathroom and kitchen that looks just like the pictures. Especially with the provided utensils and items that may have been forgotten at home.

Stayed a few nights","I had wanted to try Getaway Brown County for a year now and was pleased to find listings on AirBNB, a platform I'm familiar with. There was a little lag in communication before checking in, but once I got there, I was very pleased with everything. They really thought of including everything for you - I had packed some seemingly extra items (lighters, a flashlight, first aid kit) and they already had those. It truly was grown-up camping, without needing to set up a tent or share a bathroom/showers with strangers! The roads to the site are gravel, so drive carefully. You're only 20 minutes or so away from Brown County State Park, my husband I spent an afternoon hiking, and the next day enjoying the sounds of the rain from within our cozy cabin. We will definitely be back!"

We stayed in a similar tiny house before, and there was ventilation in the main room. This time, we couldn't open the window due to heavy rain. Sleeping was uncomfortable. The air conditioner didn't help."

Stayed a few nights",It was a pretty area. And very quiet. We loved the view. But we wished we could have spent more time outside. Even with using the tick spray that they offered and our own we were still covered in them the second our shoes touched the gravel. Some ticks make sense. But to have coating objects outside makes it a little concerning. The last day of our stay we noticed sawdust material on the phone and light switches and watched little bugs pop in and out of the wall. Overall I’m sure that others stays are great. And we just got a one off fluke experience.

Stayed one night","So much better in person! I was continuously blown away by their thoughtfulness (s’mores and campfire kit, informative signs, other amenities). I would 100% stay again because of this. I found the nature trail with the dog potty station in front and it was a beautiful hike with so many flowers. Extremely dog friendly if I had brought mine. I could tell that they thought of every single scenario and need that each guest would have out there.
The perfect getaway from city life and the reset that I needed. With that nature view from the huge window and the light rain noises, I was able to have a great rest.
Brown County State Park was only 18 mins away, Little Nashville was under 30. I had a blast exploring all the shops."

We had a little friendly raccoon come visit every night but as soon as we made noise and chased him away it was fine. The firepit and chairs nestled right against the woods was perfect for us to relax and connect. Everything was immaculate but I do recommend spraying because we had those big black ants everywhere but of course it's expected because you are in the wood. We Definitely recommend 👌

Stayed a few nights","5 stars for the Getaway house. 1 star for non-responsive hosts. The Getaway house was perfect, just as shown in photos. Very clean, cozy, beautiful surroundings. Recommend it to anyone wanting a restful and relaxing couple days off the grid. The problem was the hosts don’t respond. We arrived 20min early (240p) for a 3pm check-in. We notified the hosts and asked if we could go into the house a few minutes early (there was no one staying in or cleaning the house). No response. We messaged through the app and texted the phone number listed. No response. We called the number listed. No response. Finally at 305p (5min after check in) we called the main AirBnB line, who tried to contact the hosts. Finally at 330p - 30min after check in - we received two different codes to access the house, which was confusing. Bottom line - definitely stay in the house because it’s awesome but don’t expect the hosts to help you."

Our only complaint: the bed was a bit too firm for our liking so we tossed and turned a lot (that’s just a matter of personal preference, though). I’d love an option to select a unit by mattress firmness in future. Also, the ticks were already an issue in early April. Not at all Getaway’s fault, obviously, but be aware and check yourselves and your dogs often!"

The listing didn’t say anything about the extra costs for the amenities mentioned in the listing (firewood, boxed water, hot chocolate, s’mores, etc). The stove was still oily from the last guest spraying Pam all over. There were dirty smudges on the bathroom door. The exterior door have oily fingerprints on it. The places is about 120sqft. I don’t think I am expecting unreasonable cleaning standards between guests.
The bed was clean and the place was cute. Definitely wouldn’t do it again for the price."

We found Getaways listing and made a last minute reservation. Getaway was very accommodating and quickly confirmed our reservation. This little camper was pretty perfect for a cozy weekend in nature. Our dogs loved the area and we had plenty of trails and walks to try out. We enjoyed all the amenities it had to offer! The beds do get really hot at night so we had to make sure we set the air on the right temp but other than that, we had a great stay. Our pups even got a special treat. Lastly there were other campers within our view however everyone was very respectful and kept to themselves!"

The only noise you hear is other guests driving to or from their own cabin! The great outdoors is your living room with nature as your TV!! This is the definition of simple living! The tiny cabin really helps you grow closer with your significant other because there's no room to have any ""space"" lol. My husband and I loved the simplicity of this stay and will be back very frequently!"

I read all of the books provided; even bought one. the space was larger then I expected so I was comfortable with just me. the shower had hot water and good pressure; shampoo conditioner and body wash mounted right inside. I'm a tall plus size woman and the shower head wasn't too low and I was able to shower without being cramped. bathroom wasn't too small either. I love all the storage so not to be cluttered. the outside fit pit and chairs were nice. there was a fire ban when I attended but everything for a fire was provided including a smore kit. Bed was comfortable. Outside was very quiet everyone was respectful of each other privacy. check in was super easy and all cabins were clearly marked and there was a posted map right at the gate just to check before entering. overall was a great experince."

Stayed with a pet","Great place to getaway. Was very relaxing. There is a nature trail to walk and gravel road between all cabins. Close to Nashville, In and Brown County State Park. Appreciated all the little touches, like dog food bowls provided with a bag of treats and waste bags. There was a burn ban when we stayed, but the fire pit with lawn chairs would have been a great place to relax by. The kitchenette was well equipped so we were able to cook despite not being able to use the campfire.
We will definitely return!"

Stayed with a pet","We overall really enjoyed our stay. I will say, the cabins were much closer together than expected. Especially in a winter month when there are no leaves on the trees, you can easily see your neighbors. Cabins are quite close to the street and each other. But once you’re inside it still feels private because the big window faces the woods. The cabin is very clean and the design is lovely. It is very small but cozy. Note: There is a county fire ban that looks like it will stay in place until April 12 from what I’ve read online. We were not allowed to have any kind of campfire at all, which was a big disappointment. But obviously not their fault. I think overall this cabin is better for one night than for 2, especially with not being able to make any camp fire. There is a nice hiking trail on the property. Brown County state park trails about 30 mins away."

Something about being in nature is just good for the soul. These cabins are the best airbnb I’ve ever rented. In the description, it says “The cabin has everything that you need & nothing that you don’t need”, and that’s exactly what you’ll find. Getting away from technology and playing cards and being in nature is so healthy. What an iconic idea, we are already booking our next trip. We’re planning on traveling around the country as Getaway has Cabins in many places. Thank you, truly."

Stayed a few nights","We had a great time on our trip! The cabin looks just as described and the amenities were great. We loved the s’mores kits and the fire pit. It was a short drive to everything.
The only mild complaint we had is that the overhead photo on the listing shows longer driveways to the cabins and more privacy than in reality. If you step outside the cabin there is no privacy meaning no privacy at the fire pit. We could see at least 4 other cabins and their occupants when outside. From our big window we could see another cabin and their fire pit and vehicle and could see them turning on and off lights in their cabin at night (we did visit in a winter month so if the trees were full there would likely be less visibility). This did not affect our enjoyment much and we would definitely visit again but we were a little surprised when we arrived because of the pictures in the listing."

Stayed with a pet","Our stay was incredible. The second we walked in, we knew we’d found a spot we’ll return to again and again. The setting and views are incredible, of course, but the amenities are exceptionally thoughtful. We had our dogs with us, and bowls, treats, etc. were provided for our stay; there was even a tie-out attached to the picnic table so they could roam a bit without being off-leash. We had an incredible time.
One note I’ll add for future guests is that the address provided leads you to a sign that says “staff only,” and there are a number of no-trespassing signs associated with a house on the same road. I’m still not quite sure what the setup is there but it made finding the spot initially a little confusing."

Both of us use a C-pap and the way the bed is set up against the end wall it isn't easy to set up the machine for the person sleeping against the wall. Will definitely consider renting from them again.

Not getaways fault just a disclaimer for fellow pet owners to consider. It was every time they went outside we found ticks on her. Other than that place has all you need and is fun. It is very small if small ain’t your thing and cramped then don’t do this one. Otherwise a great time we really enjoyed ourselfs."

But other than that the cabin was well worth it. Didnt like that they are so close together that i can see all of our neighbors but at least we cant look in eachothers windows. The drive in was pretty treacherous and would probably be very difficult for smaller cars, especially in the rain. Overall great experience and only 20mins away from Nashville. Lots of conflicting information about weather the firewood and smores are complimentary. Please make it clear somewhere on the booking site."

We brought our Golden Retriever, and Getaway was so accommodating. They left little dog bowls and doggie bags, which was so thoughtful. We walked the nature path at the back of the property and we loved it! We also hit some trails and shops in Brown County and it was a short 20 minute drive to downtown Nashville.
We even struggled with some snow, getting out of the drive, and their staff was already onsite and came up to offer us traction mats. They were around and available, but not too much in our space.
10/10 would recommend for a private, serene setting."

There was some strange confusion though about provisions (fire wood, coffee, s'mores, etc) inside and at the location. The listing says some things are included, like fire wood and s'mores for example, but when you enter the cabin you will find a list of items that will cost extra. Fire wood and s'mores are on this list. (Unless this is changed by the time you are reading this. which hopefully it is.) That said, I haven't gotten a bill for the items I used, and when I messaged the host they didn't answer my question about if they were included or not. Hopefully this confusion is cleared up before your stay."

Stayed one night","I absolutely LOVED staying here with Getaway. In fact, I loved it so much that I actually booked another night. The team was super responsive and helpful in getting me another night and reimbursing me so I wasn't paying a cleaning fee twice. This tiny house looked EXACTLY like the pictures and the woods were even more stunning in person. They even have a private walking trail, which is nice (though it's made of chunky rocks, not gravel, so bring good shoes). The amenities were great. The only downsides were that they mean it when they say there is a small hot water tank. I only had hot water for about 5 minutes both times I took a shower. The only other thing to warn about (which this is in no way Getaway's fault) is that the property is surrounded by a bunch of private property where people hunt, so you will hear occasional gunshots. Overall however, I had an amazing time and this place was the exact amount of peaceful and loveliness that I needed. Thank you, Getaway."

Stayed a few nights","Beautiful historic building and we will book again when we return to Seymour. A few great surprises like the hidden prize (no, I won't give you any clues). I wish that their coffee shop downstairs was in my neighborhood- I would be there every day. I only share the below cautions to prepare you and I encourage you not to let them turn you off. Great place and great people.
A few cautions.
1) Steep stairs, though even my stair-phobic wife made it with no problem.
2) Noisy trains overnight. I find the train noise soothing, but grew up with it. My family members who are less used to it found it bothersome.
3) Heat needs to be up a bit higher to get into the bedrooms. Leave the doors open for the best circulation."

Stayed a few nights","We are from Massachusetts. When we journey to the Midwest we are always charmed by the historic small towns and the friendliness of the residents. Seymour, Indiana is no exception.
Montica’s Air BandB is somewhat of a time travel…a late 1800s building, floors and windows that resonate with that era. Stand at the front windows and blur your vision a bit. Just like a movie that floats back in time, you will be transported as you imagine the turn of the century here. Sit in the living area and you are mid century modern. Prepare a meal in the kitchen, you are squarely in 2023.
This was the most spacious two bedroom we have seen in our travels. We will return and always feel at home.
Dint miss this opportunity if you are passing through."

They do have open stairs, but also provided a baby gate. We had our 3 little boys there and did find having our own gate with us as well (the apartment is vintage so the doorways were open to the hallway with the stairs.
It is right above their own coffee shop, and the drinks were great! They were very generous in offering free coffee the next morning. Cute little area, that felt safe, and seems very walkable. Parking was easy."

Stayed a few nights","Airbnb above a coffee shop in downtown Seymour (the town where John Mellencamp is from). Parking is at the rear of the building in the back of a little square park between buildings. The little park has flowers and squirrels. You enter directly into the unit, but take a floor of steps to get to the second floor of the building where the rooms are. Note you do have to be able to walk up steps. Not a problem for us, but might be for some people. You then enter a long hallway that leads to the living room/kitchen. Along the hallway are the bathroom (there is only one), a small laundry area with a washer and dryer, and two bedrooms. In the bathroom is a walk in shower with great water pressure. We all absolutely loved the shower. Both bedrooms had beds with foam mattresses. The kitchen is a full kitchen with microwave, refrigerator/freezer, stove, oven, dishwasher. There is a bootlegger hidden panel in the floor of the kitchen/living room where you might find some liquor."

Initially, I was a little worried the coffee shop downstairs would be loud in the mornings but we could hardly hear it at all. In fact, the smell of coffee in the morning was wonderful! It was nice to hang out with the locals in the morning downstairs and get the 'inside scoop' on the area."

Some changes—like tread on the slippery, steep stairs, tightening up rickety furniture, and fixing the sticky, stubborn kitchen drawers—could help this charming place reach a super new level."

The house was a nice place to stay, it is nearby to other properties but still feels private. It’s about a 10-15 minute drive from the city. The main room is quite large with a private bathroom, while the other two are decent sizes off the living area. The loft is right above the kitchen, and open to the living area.

Stayed with kids","We live in the area, but due to the winter storm and temps dropping, our pipes froze. I immediately got on to Airbnb website and looked locally… found this gem. I was of course nervous, we had about 2 hours to get confirmation that this house didn’t have frozen pipes (everyone around us had same issue)… Linda answered very quickly, checked to make sure water was good to go and accepted our request all within a short amount of time. We had 6 kids and our adult daughter with us, and to top it off it was Christmas weekend. We were so blessed and grateful for Linda and her hospitality! She checked in with us and was easily able to get in to contact with when needed. This place is beautiful! It’s a must see and stay. We are thinking about reserving in the spring so we can enjoy the outside as well. Such a cool place!"
