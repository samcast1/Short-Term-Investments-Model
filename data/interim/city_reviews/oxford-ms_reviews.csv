Stayed a few nights","If your visiting Ole Miss this is the place to stay. A short car ride to campus (less then 2 min) makes it ideal! It was exactly as described with nicely appointed furnishings and the bed was comfy!!!
Will definitely stay here again.
Nathan was kind enough to let us check out a little later in the morning which was awesome!!!

Stayed a few nights","I had a wonderful Thanksgiving stay at Nathan's Airbnb in Oxford, Mississippi. The cozy atmosphere made it a comfortable home away from home. We're in Oxford every week for Ole Miss games, and Nathan's place stood out for its warmth and convenience. Despite an unexpected visit to the ER for my niece and daughter, the proximity to medical care, less than 2 minutes away, was a silver lining. Overall, I would definitely choose Nathan's place again for future stays."

Nice complex of condos, safe area, conveniently located and easy to find for out-of-towners. Enjoy!"

Stayed a few nights","Nathan's Place was the perfect location for our weekend in Oxford attending the LSU-Ole Miss football game. The condo is an easy 30 min. walk to The Grove and a shorter walk to the football/ baseball stadiums. The walk is along sidewalks and beautiful once you enter the campus. 30 minutes was comparable to any of the public parking lots without the hassle of driving. The condo is also an easy 10-15 minute drive to the Square. The apartment is as pictured with a spacious living/dining area. The dining table is set for 4 but easily accommodated 6. The kitchen is well stocked with utensils, plates, and glasses. The refrigerator is full sized. We did not cook but used the full sized stove to heat food we brought in. The peninsula provided plenty of space to lay out multiple dishes. The beds were comfortable. The bathrooms were small but perfectly adequate. Someone was in touch daily to see if we needed anything. It was nice to sit outside on the patio. We would return here."

Nathan shared great information with us from what the condo had to offer to how to check in to local restaurants and places of interest. We would definitely stay at Nathan’s condo again.

Stayed a few nights","I’ve stayed at quite a few Airbnb’s in Oxford over the last couple of years and this was the first time I did not choose a unique place like a farm or cottage. A place that is unique. With this being said, it is easier to add special nuances when you only own 1 or 2 Airbnb’s, which is not the case for Nathen. He owns 60+ properties in Oxford and has a management company running them. This is the only way to ensure they are properly taken care of. So although this condo was more generic (for lack of a better word) it was exactly as described in the listing and pictures. It was very clean, super easy to access and in a perfect location, all of which I appreciate. I would definitely recommend this place."

I won't stay anywhere else now when I come. His units are the closes thing to home as you can get when you can't be at home. His units are clean, quiet and very inviting. He and his staff are also awesome. Should you have any issues, they are on top of it quick. If you try and book with Nathan and there are no vacancies all I can say is you should've booked earlier. Thanks Nathan and staff for making my stay away from home as close to home like as possible."

Stayed with kids","It is a beautiful condo! We have 2 small girls and the pool had plenty of shallow areas which they could play in without much worry they would be falling into deeper water accidently. The next thing is just personal preference, it had nothing to do with anything wrong or that could have been different: the bed was very different, maybe it's memory foam? But it wasn't comfortable for myself, I'm used to more soft pillow top mattresses, again nothing that was wrong at all, just personal preference. My girls slept like rocks, and my oldest said she liked the bed allot! Everything was exactly as pictured, and the kitchen is well stocked with everything you could need! We did not use the balcony, so I can't speak to that at all. They even had extra shampoo/ lotion that I forgot so I was very thankful! The actual building was a little hard to find, GPS doesn't bring you right there. But we figured it out without having to message for help, again not anything wrong,just sharing experience."

Stayed with kids","Loved our little family getaway here! Highly recommend staying. The only two negatives (and I don't want them to detract--more just things to be aware of) are 1) it's not walkable to the downtown area, which people going to Oxford might want and 2) It's on a second floor with a pretty steep staircase, so not super friendly to the less physically active like the very young or very old. Overall, though, condo was super cute and pool was wonderful :)"

Stayed with kids","This place was great. Nicely decorated, a fantastic tv in the living area for watching Game Day or other games until time to go to the grove. It's directly across from the pool, so this is good if you have kids that like to swim & weather permits. The work out facility is below this condo, so that's convenient for getting in a quick workout before you start your day. This condo is a few miles down & off of Molly Barr Road, so it's not super close to campus, but an easy drive. We had four adults & two kids (ages 10). The space did feel cramped with that many people staying, & a half bath would have been nice due to others occupying showers & getting dressed (for privacy)in the baths attached to the bedrooms. The coffee pot is sleek & pretty, but difficult to work/not user friendly even with the provided instructions. We gave up & bought our morning coffee at various coffee shops nearby. Overall, our stay was great. I would stay here again just with less people."

If you want a Hotty Toddy of an experience in a clean, beautifully decorated, great beds, unbelievable showers and awesome deck, look no more. We highly recommend this location & Sherry!"

Other than those few minor issues, the house was perfect and just as stated in the listing."

Comfortable beds, luxurious bedding no microfiber sheets. No toxic chemicals for those sensitive.
The yard is like a park with lots of moss to kick off the shoes and ground.
Beautiful neighborhood and Oxford is a beautiful town. Would definitely stay at Rob’s again. Our stay at Rob’s made our business trip feel like staying at a 5 star resort."

She even sets out fresh eggs from her farm on the counter for you. When you wake up in the morning to have coffee on the back deck, you’ll see bunnies, chickens and cats hanging out together on the property. The goats and sheep and pigs are definitely pets. We took a bag of apples and carrots to feed them with the host, Ashley! She is awesome. You might just want to go stay there to meet her and her animals. Those animals adore her. I look forward to coming back again. The home is really well thought out and had so much character. It is close to the Oxford Square. Stay here and love it as much as I did."

Stayed with a pet","9.9/10 Would recommend. 👍🏼 Wonderful place! Lots of fun goats bunnies, chickens, etc. If the goats are out, consider picking up your young kids cuz they can get a little head-butty, but certainly nothing dangerous.. just light nudges. The farm fresh eggs were DELICIOUS and plentiful. Fireflies lit the air at dusk, and our pup loved running around in the big yard. The kids/twin beds are in a loft above the living area so you have to be quiet if kids are sleeping.. or you can sit on the back porch and enjoy the crickets like we did. The AC works great and is adjustable. There are fun tree swings around, but keep an eye out for the fire-ant hills that come standard in the southern US.
Thanks for a great stay! We’ll be back!"

Just felt that there was too much stuff in the place - would be good to find a way for it to be pared back a little. Roosters are pretty noisy. But we’re used to animals so it didn’t affect us at all. Goats are lovely.

Stayed with a pet","Ad described ""4 acres of beautiful country side that's free to wander,"" but it was a small sectioned off piece of land in a neighborhood with an electric fence blocking the back area. One morning we woke up to a multitude of cars blocking us in, large groups of people wandering around, & several families walking up/sitting on the porch of our cottage disturbing us/our dogs. Although Ashley did later apologize once we walked out to get eggs, the unexpected visitors were not considerate to us as paying guests & wandered from early in the morning to the afternoon. This was not the quiet/remote getaway we were expecting. We weren't aware a field trip with multiple families would be there at the same time we were paying to be there. Ashley also recommended a friend/neighbor to take pictures of us. Quoted a price for the ""whole lot"" after the sitting fee was paid in cash. When pictures were finally viewable, the price for them was over double the first price given. Take your own pictures."

My kids didn’t stop interacting with the animals the entire time we were there. It was so relaxing to just sit in the rocking chairs and take it all in! I am so grateful that we had this downtime together as a family without distractions. Thank you so much for a fantastic couple of days. We can’t wait to visit again!!!"

Her communication from the minute of booking was 5 stars! Then when arriving everything was exactly as promised and more! I spent a night here to get away from the city and it filled my soul. Not only was the place magical, Ashley as a host is one of the best. Her heart and little touches are all through out the property. And getting a chance to share her home and animals was a true blessing. Highly Recommend!!!"

Stayed with kids","We had a spectacular stay at Sweet Lucy Farm! The animals are friendly, adorable, hilarious hosts — the kitty cats and goats immediately welcomed us into to the fam.
The cottage was perfect for me and my 11 year-old kiddo, with room to spare. Everything was as good or better than expected with lots of thoughtful details. Piping hot water in the shower, nice selection of streaming services on the TV (though the critters provided plenty of live entertainment), comfy sheets and linens on the beds, etc.
Pop by Square Books in Oxford for a new book and settle in one of the rocking chairs at the farm — it’s heaven on earth."

The cottage is exquisitely decorated like a place you would see in Southern Living magazine! The farm animals are so precious & loving! Beware, you may want a small farm of your own after staying! So wonderful to relax on the porch rockers or swing on the tree swings or take a country bike ride. Having a relaxing country farm fresh egg breakfast is the BEST! So close to downtown Oxford too! Truly a little slice of heaven! We will be back annually, if not more! Better than a trip to the spa - pure relaxation & awe, pure JOY!

There are also a couple of friendly cats, cute bunnies, a host a red cardinals and a few hawks. They soothe the soul. We loved having morning coffee on the porch as we listened to the roosters. We loved watching the sunset and sky and swinging on the swing. Ashley, the owner, is like sunshine! Staying at Sweet Lucy Farm was a wonderful respite for these city folks from New York City.

An arctic blast came through and some of the pipes were frozen.. next thing we know Ashley is blocking the heat and setting up a warmer underneath the cottage late at night.. not only was she an incredible host with her communication and dedication but what a hoot.. probably chatted more with her in the Airbnb thread than I did my mom the whole trip 🤣.. my kids and husband loved loved the animals and free range to explore the farm. It was a perfect Christmas experience and so so so glad I (we) met Ashley!!

The Cottage at Sweet Lucy Farm was such a serene and fun getaway for our family. The animals and Ashley have left a mark on our hearts. And just 10 minutes up the road from Ole Miss ❤️💙. We already miss it and can’t wait to come back! The animals definitely feel like pets - they’re so friendly and you have as much access to them as you want, which was so wonderful for the kids. We could go visit with them anytime of day or night. The eggs are so fresh - we picked 20 of them our first day! The cottage is exactly like the pictures - it’s the perfect little cozy spot. Ashley has bikes, chairs and a firepit and grill. We loved making a fire at night. She even provides a noise machine in the bedroom in case the roosters wake you up! We actually loved hearing them in the morning and the sheeps ‘baa’ing’ when we went to bed at night. As a mom, I feel like I hit a home run booking this."

The cottage is beautifully and tastefully decorated, comfortable and private. The Christmas decorations Ashley put up were also very much appreciated. Sweet Lucy Farm is about a 12 minute drive to Oxford where most restaurants are located. We highly recommend Snackbar and Jinsei.

Stayed with kids","Sweet Lucy Farms is an amazing Airbnb experience. All around greatness - Location, uniqueness, value, communication, animals!!, and accommodations. We visited with our two young children, and they would have been content staying on site and playing with the wonderful farm animals the entire time. Ashley does a great job of showing the kids the ropes and giving them freedom to explore and care for the animals. The cottage itself is awesome. Wonderfully built, full of charm, with everything you need. So very peaceful. Ashley's property is a quick 10 minutes from town, so it was easy to go back and forth and enjoy everything that Oxford has to offer."

The stylish, comfortable furnishings, the bucolic setting complete with adorable farm animals, and a fully stocked kitchen will sure to make your getaway all that you’ve ever wanted. Extra touches: a fire pit with surrounding chairs for viewing the stars late at night (you might even hear a Barred Owl hooting in a nearby tree); farm fresh eggs for whipping up breakfast; the softest sheets I’ve ever felt; did I mention that the animals are the cutest? — the baby goats were especially sweet, and it was a perfect morning when I could sit out on the back porch with my coffee, gaze into the back pasture, and watch those little guys (plus the sheep and Kunekune pigs) grazing on hay. Thank you, Ashley!"

Goats, pigs, sheep, chickens and fire flies.
My daughter picked eggs for the first time ever, and enjoyed truly fresh eggs ( 5 minutes from picking) for the first time.
And it was my first taste of fresh eggs in decades - a real treat!!
When we left it felt like the farm where I grew up. I can't say exactly why, maybe the feel and scent of the of the air, but it was wonderful.
Highly recommended."

Stayed with kids","A stay at Sweet Lucy Farm is always worth it! My family has stayed there twice now and we plan to stay again. The cottage is super cute, cozy and has everything you need, including fresh eggs! The animals make for a fun experience for kids and adults. You can feed the goats, sheep and pigs or run around with the chickens and roosters. If you're lucky, a chicken may even come to hang out on the back porch with you! Watching the sunset over the pasture is so peaceful and picture perfect. If you're lucky enough to get a midnight rain shower during your stay, you'll get to hear the most relaxing sound... rain on a tin roof, the best soundtrack for a good night's sleep. Watching the cows roam around the pasture while having your morning coffee on the back porch is also a great way to start the day. Ashley is an amazing host and the farm is an amazing place; I highly recommend you check it out if you find yourself in Oxford."

Freshly brewed coffee in hand, we loved sitting on the porch in the rocking chairs while watching as our son had such a wonderful time playing with the barnyard crew and swinging on the tire swing. We even grabbed a couple of bikes and took a little ride down the country road, stopping to inhale what smelled just like honeysuckle. It felt like we were in a movie.

Stayed a few nights","I’ve stayed in Airbnb’s around the world, and Callie’s Powder Blue Pointe is one of the best.
Callie is amazing & incredibly responsive. Her care for guests is absolutely incredible & she immediately felt like a friend.
PBP is adorable & the location is ideal. The area is quiet and peaceful, and being able to walk to the Square is such a bonus. The unit is well stocked - and well decorated!! We had everything we needed to prepare quick meals. There were plenty of kitchen consumables (paper towels, dishwasher pods, etc) and an abundance of clean towels, bedding & pillows. The art and makes it feel like home. The Oxford & Ole Miss touches are perfect.
Callie’s “rules” are minimal - enjoy the space, be comfortable, set the temp where you like, and don’t worry about a long checkout list. Simply respect & enjoy the space. Staying at PWP felt like staying with a friend."

It's definitely one of the most peaceful places to stay in Oxford and we will be staying there in the future! If anyone reading this is curious as to whether or not they should book her BnB, the answer is yes. You will feel right at home."

Stayed with a pet","The condo was BEYOND PERFECT for our little family of four: two adults and two pups! Finding this perfect pet friendly place was a plus! It was spotless clean (smelled great!), was beautifully decorated, and the bed was so comfy. It had everything we needed -even our own parking spot right out the door and a big fenced green area for the pups to play and potty. It really felt like home all the time. The location was unbeatable! The condo was just five minutes from the square. There we found fantastic places for dinner, breakfast, great coffee, lunch, shopping and more. And now to the most important part of this review… Callie was AWESOME!! She communicated with us all the time, and made sure we had the best time there. She told us about the best places to eat and go with the pups. Thanks to Callie, we had the best time in Oxford. We highly recommend this condo! It will definitely be our favorite spot to stay every time we visit town. Thanks again, Callie!"

The aesthetics of every detail in the home were not only pretty, but fun. Beautiful coffee mugs, champagne flutes, cozy pretty blankets for late night conversations in the living room. The communication with Cassie was quick and helpful! Televisions worked well and there is one in each bedroom and the living room. We LOVED our stay and would love to go back."

Thank you so much for a lovely weekend in your property.
We truly enjoyed being there, and felt at home from the moment we walked in the door. We loved all the little touches that you offered.
We walked to the square Both nights for dinner and got our girl moved in for the year at Ole Miss.
We would love to stay there again sometime.

Lots of snacks, coffee and extras that we would normally have to bring. All a nice surprise. There is a nice large field/yard that is fenced in by the condo and was perfect for our dog to get a run in. The best host we ever had. We had a situation where we needed our dog let out while we were in a meeting and she arranged for somebody to come by and check on here for a few times during the day. Also I should add - great location just walk right up to the square for lunch or dinner or shopping bookstore!"

Favorite parts were the festive decor, quiet community, coffee bar/bar area and the amazing water pressure. Oh yeah, and the little vornado fan next to the bed in the master…pleasant surprise and a very nice touch from someone who has clearly thought of everything to make guests feel welcome and comfortable.

The apartment feels like a luxury hotel, but home at the same time! It’s obvious how much thought Callie has put into her space from the hospitality to decor! The location is wonderful just being one hill away for the Oxford Square. Callie saw we rented for an infant & messaged me to see what she could do to make the apartment more family friendly for us & future guests. She had bath products, extra wipes & infant utensils waiting for us along with a pack & play for our baby to sleep in! We had a great weekend & can’t wait to rent this space again!"

The condo itself is beautifully appointed - everything made it feel like home! The bed was like sleeping on clouds and the towels were thick and soft! There are even makeup washcloths to take off makeup if you wear any and a hairdryer (which I forgot to pack so this was great!) The entire place was perfect!

Stayed about a week","We were very excited to stay here, but it was a disappointment. We are not the type of guests to constantly reach out and complain so had we done that corrections might have been made to a few of the issues.
Showers were dirty with used bars of soap, the kitchen was not stocked well, no knives. no toaster, no can opener… so plan ahead.
The furnace is very loud. We were there long enough to know we wouldn’t stay again because it was virtually impossible to sleep. The TV in the living room is good. Furniture is comfortable, appliances were good and new, I had to remove the shipping tape in the oven to use it. I did reach out because the fridge wasn’t cooling.
Washer is super loud, heads up don’t start it late at night. I wish I had a better rd use because it’s a nice place but didn’t work well for us and it was lacking basic needs."
