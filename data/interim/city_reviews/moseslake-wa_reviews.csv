Group trip","This Airbnb was perfect for our vacation at Moses Lake. Gladys’s place is extremely clean, well put together and it felt just like home. We were even provided free breakfast which was a huge plus. I would definitely recommend this place if you are staying in Moses lake and which is roughly 5-10 mins from everything."

Great location in town. Very quiet and peaceful. Not to mention what a great host. Just when I think a host couldn't get any better, they just took it to the next level. Thank you so much, would recommend to anyone looking in the area."

When communicating with the owner the next day, I found out that the construction wasn't going to be finished in time for my rental. I felt it was going to be unsafe for my 2 year old granddaughter so I canceled the reservation. It was unfortunate that this happened, I was looking forward to my stay."

Would definitely recommend this place if anyone is ever in the area. Thanks again for hosting!"

Stayed a few nights","I highly recommend this home! We stayed here when visiting the area for a concert at the Gorge Amphitheater. I’m not a camper so this house was a comfort and had literally everything you’d need and then some! They thought of everything and even left little things to make the stay more enjoyable! A large kitchen for making meals, washer, dryer, comfortable beds, bikes, golf clubs and even stand up paddle boards. Way over the top with everything!
I also recommend the Saturday farmers market which is about 10 minutes away for souvenirs and fresh flowers.
It’s next to a fun water park. We took the SUP to Blue Heron Park about 15 minutes away and ate at Michael’s on the Lake which is only about 10 minutes. I also recommend that place. Everything you need is all within a mile and the Gorge was around 41 minutes away. There’s a lot to do in this little town and Gladys was extremely accommodating leaving everything to make this a stress free trip!"

Stayed a few nights","Amazing home! Gladys made us feel very welcome with all of the personal touches. She even provided a few local treats and sundries. We felt right at home! It’s a great area - very quiet and safe. We utilized the bikes and iSUPs - we biked from the house to Montlake Park and back and we used the iSUPs at Blue Heron Park (just a short drive from the house). We asked to have the golf clubs available to us as well, but didn’t have time to go to the driving range - next time for sure! Gladys was easy to communicate with and responded quickly. The house is close to plenty of restaurants (fast food or otherwise), grocery stores, gas stations, and is a quick drive to Downtown Moses Lake. I highly recommend staying at this place when you visit Moses Lake! We look forward to staying again sometime in the future!"

Darla was aware of the circumstances of our visit and was so kind, responsive, and accommodating. We wanted a place that would serve as a landing pad for all of us. The most wonderful part was the location, as we have extensive family history in that neighborhood. It was so special to be together with that familiar and breathtaking view! The beds were very comfortable and the layout provided opportunities for multiple groups/generations to gather in different spaces. The extra refrigerator downstairs made a big difference for us. Everyone agreed that we will absolutely gather there again, next time for happier circumstances. A million thanks, Darla!"

Bring some sun block if you plan on enjoying that upper deck as the PM sun can get pretty intense. This house was perfect for our relaxing adult only get away. I could easily see bringing our kids with us if we were to stay again in the future. We were in town for a concert at the Gorge. This was a great spot for us and our group of 6 enjoyed being able to comfortably relax and enjoy our time together. Thank you Darla for sharing your home!!

Group trip","The house was beautiful with all the needed things in place for visitors. Everything nicely arranged and planned for incoming guests, host response was prompt. Sunset view in evening was amazing. The house is very near to lake so if you are looking some water activities it’s a great location.
One issue we found was if guests move anything around the house like a blanket to maybe living room area, she does not take that well, we received a call claiming you have taken her blanket without looking around the house or asking her cleaning staff, as later they told her it was right there in the house itself, which is not something visitors should be worried of when they are actually looking for fun times. Due to this confusion we stop after couple of miles trying to help her locate a blanket due to which missed out, on joining a planned surprise birthday.
Overall, I would say our stay was perfect and Darla was great apart from the above event. I would still book at her place again if get a chance to visit Moses lake again and will recommend other guests as well as, confusion may happen sometimes :)"

Perched on a high bluff directly above the lake, with panoramic west-facing views all the way to Rainier and spectacular sunsets. Ample back lawn to enjoy the view from, plus a balcony off the master suite and a covered patio for outdoor dining. And our daughter especially loved the swingset."

The beach decor makes it feel like a get away home, the location and space is incredible, and the photos are not kidding about the view! Our group showed up and decided to delay plans a bit just so we could sit on the back porch and enjoy the sunset over the lake. Incredible- would stay again."

Stayed a few nights","We're already talking about how we hope Dave's place is available when we return to Moses Lake. Everythingwe needed, and then some, was under one roof. We also appreciated the location a short distance from the freeway, yet incredibly quiet. Beds and linens were perfect. Loved the fans in both rooms (Unit 2). Having an ensuite in each bedroom was very convenient. The air conditioning was efficient and quiet. Kitchen had all we needed for meal prep. Ice cube trays were appreciated. Sliding glass doors upstairs and downstairs were great for fresh air. Dave was a fabulous host who answered questions promptly and was immediately helpful and a pleasure to communicate with. Hope to have a chance to stay again one day."

Stayed with a pet","I wish I could give 4.5 stars because it really was a great stay. The homes is just as stunning in person as shown in the photos. Each room was really spacious that not having the master didn't mean you'd be sleeping in a small crowded room.
The AC does take time to cool the home, so keep that in mind on 100+ days. Never hurts to confirm that the AC will be on when you arrive. Once it gets going though, you and your dog(s) will be so happy you booked this property with Jessica.
We were able to reach Jessica when we had any questions and she was very responsive. Her home was a great spot for those of us that work remotely. Sometimes I would need to step outside to take a work call which could mean excess background noises from neighbors. However, that wasn't an issue. Even at night no rowdy neighbors.
House rules are located in a binder. They were reasonable and easy to follow.
Great area with local breweries, state parks, lakes, amazing hiking trails and more. Dog friendly property. The backyard trees are great to keep a portion shadded and cooler even during warm days.
Jessica is a great host. No hesitation to book this property again in the future. We would recommend this property to others. Thank you, Jessica!"

Their place was the perfect quiet retreat after long days of taking care of everything. It was peaceful, quiet, and private. The bed was extremely comfortable. I will for sure be using them again if I have to go back. I ended up leaving one day earlier than I intended and they were super gracious and refunded me for a night. I can’t recommend them more: thank you again!"

I am an amputee so things are more difficult for me than for most but I knew that I wouldn't be able to get into the shower ahead of time and didn't need to shower the one night I stayed there. I loved the small touches and the obvious care they take of the place that showed forth throughout. It was a very comfortable bed and you could adjust the air temperature easily. I would highly recommend this place but would say that it is not the best if you are a wheelchair user and need to bathe.

They were super kind and allowed us to check in as early as we liked as no one was staying the night before. They were quick to respond and the place was clean and tidy.
Climbing the ladder to the up top bed is quite steep and a little scary but other than that everything was great!!!"

The house had more than enough space for two couples with three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a large living room (with comfy couches!), kitchen, dining room, and a cute covered patio. The entire place was very clean and just about everything we needed was provided (towels, soap, hair dryer, dishes, coffee, etc). While it may seem like this home is in the middle of nowhere, the location is actually pretty convenient. There is a Wal-Mart, grocery store, gas, and local restaurants about 10-15 minutes away."

Stayed with kids","Such a beautiful home with a great view. The house has 4 bedrooms, and each one has direct access to a bathroom with a shower / tub which is a great thing when you're sharing this house with other families. The bathrooms were spotless, soap, shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel dispensers were full everywhere. The master bedroom had a king size bed, and one of the largest bathrooms I've see. Two other bedrooms had queen size beds and one had bunk beds that were perfect for the largest family of the group. The mattresses were too soft for my taste, but no one else in the group had any complains about it.
The living room had a large TV with a home theater attached that made watching movies super fun.
The kitchen had very nice appliances, and was full of cookware and utensils.
We didn't get to spend a lot of time outside because it was sub freezing, but that made it perfect for some sledding activity in the huge backyard.
Finally, James and Crystal were super reponsive and friendly."

Stayed with a pet","My parents (almost 80 years old), my aunt, my husband and our dog stayed for a long weekend at Rene's place. My brother lives in Moses Lake and he was hosting a family get together.
The home was perfect for us. 3 separate bedrooms, with comfy beds. Our dog sleeps in a crate, which was easy to get in and out of the house and bedroom. I loved the clean and private hot tub with some therapeutic jet options. The fully fenced backyard was perfect. The neighborhood was great to walk the dog in too.
We also enjoyed the large kitchen. It is shown in the pictures, but there is not a traditional table and chairs. the kitchen island is large and seats 3, plus there are additional stools you can add. We utilized the additional fridge in the garage, it was helpful getting items together for the event at my brother's.
it is a quick drive into downtown Moses Lake where you can pick up supplies. I would stay at Rene's again."

We had the WiFi go out the first night I was there, I messaged her the next morning not even 10 minutes & she was on top of it. She is very sweet & same with her husband. I had my service animal with me & usually he’s anxious when we aren’t sleeping in our homestead. But he felt right at home also they do have a dog food & water bowl there for if you do bring your furry friends. I highly recommend staying here & I most definitely plan on staying again in the future."

Honestly, I wish I could teleport her place to some other places my son and I take road trips to. We were just here for my son to take his SAT so I doubt I'd have a chance to stay again, but if ever I'm in Moses Lake, this would definitely be the first place I check! You won't be disappointed!!!"

Stayed one night","Very comfortable place to stay. Had all the amenities you could ask for. At 97 degrees outside when we arrived, really appreciated the air conditioning, ceiling fan and the ice and water dispenser in the refrigerator. Able to park right by the door and no steps. Good place for people mobility impaired like my husband. Only limitation is the bed is a little high. He was able to use it but could be challenging for shorter people."

The recommendations for nearby activities was great, so my boys and I decided to head to the lake and the sand dunes on a whim and had a wonderful time.
The Wonder Hut was clean, beautiful, and fully equipped with what we needed—it was even nice to see some oatmeal proceed for breakfast! When it was time to leave after our stay, my boys didn’t want to leave “Mom, can we stay? I’m so comfortable here!”
Thanks for a great stay!"

The fold out couch was comfortable with a twin size mattress topper. The queen bed was also very comfortable. There was alot of storage, in case you would like to store your bags out of sight. there's a large laundry room and a kitchen with full size appliances. The bathroom was large too, with lots of storage. This place was great for us. it was about 30-40 minutes easy commute to the gorge for a concert. There are various restaurants from fast food to fancy, and much to do in Moses Lake. great place to stay for a concert at the gorge!"

I run an Airbnb myself and I know how difficult accommodating this request can be. We were in Moses Lake visiting a dying friend so we really needed some kindness. The motel we stayed in the night before was more expensive, not as nice or as quiet, but was already full the second night. Gaylene was a real life saver. I highly recommend Gaylene as a host. Her place is sparkling clean and well stocked."

It's very private. The bed and sofa bed are very comfortable. The AC unit kept the place blissfully cool. Everything's spotless. The shower is nice and had great water pressure. Checking in and out were a breeze. Thanks so much for having us, Gaylene!"

The host lives next door and was there to help out with anything and was extremely nice and easy to contact. The only thing I say might need improvement is the directions online. When I typed in the address to my maps it took me to the fire station up the road but wasn’t too far away. I would definitely come back. :)

There is a 180 degree, westward facing view of grasslands, lake and the homes on the other side of the lake. Very nice.

One note: the coffee maker during our visit was a Keurig setup so you may want to bring a French press, a drip coffee maker or your own Keurig pods if you are particular about your morning coffee.

The host indicated the bed being in a closet but we missed it and the host said it is set up per request so if you are needing the fifth bed, make sure to request that prior with the host so it can be set up. Other than that, we appreciate the beautiful views and home. Also how easy it was to work with the host."

Stayed with kids","Eric and Chastity did a fantastic job getting the house ready for us to use. I could go on for a long time about how great it was. They had a generous lot of pantry items to fill in for things we didn't bring. The Keurig was well stocked. Plenty of extra towels and anything you could possibly need was there. If you are nitpicky and we are not, I suppose you could critique that the cabinets were golden oak and maybe that's not your favorite color. wonderful stay."

The home has plenty of space, a large well stocked kitchen, gorgeously decorated bedrooms with high quality down pillows and top quality mattresses. The living room is a relaxing place to unwind…large tv, fireplace, comfy recliners and a gorgeous lake view.
It’s a safe stay in a gated community. Highlights for me were the coffee bar, the comfy beds and the little thoughtful touches.
Highly recommend. Stop looking elsewhere and just book this place.

She let us check in early because we can all the way from the western part of Washington and let us check out around 12pm. The beds were really comfy, there were labels for where everything in the kitchen was. They also had a binder with the wifi password, the door code, the gate code, activities to do around Moses Lake, and pictures of Mose lake. Everything about the house was phenomenal, the rooms are super spacious, and I love how everything was organized and labeled. I would definitely recommend to stay at this home!!! Thank you again for giving us the opportunity to stay in your home!!!

We were only passing through Moses Lake and had never been. It is set in an industrial area but don""t let that dissuade anyone from booking. The community is gated, well lit and very quiet. Very close to Blue Heron park and jumping back onto I 90. The fireplace worked perfectly, my sons enjoyed as we came in late from the snow. Your place was a diamond in the rough.

It is one of the cleanest places including hotels that I have ever stayed in! The kitchen has everything you need for cooking except a toaster, we used the oven but not as convenient if you are cooking other items. Due to Covid, there was no indoor dining at restaurants so we decided to use Door Dash for delivery. Even though this house is in a gated location, we had no difficulty getting delicious, hot food delivered! Since it was a cold and snowy, we were looking forward to using the fireplace but upon arrival it wasn’t working. The owners quickly responded to my text and even FaceTime to see if they could help us get it going. We couldn’t get it working but I appreciated the owners help and quick response. Highly recommend this rental!! I think this location would be even more amazing in the summer."

Plenty of amenities, extremely clean and organized, and the interior was super chic.

The back yard is just a stone's throw away from the lake, what else can I ask? The house is large, clean and well furnished. The owner left extra snacks and drinks. Netflix, Prime Video and etc. make it feel like home.
We didn't have a clear plan where to go when we left home. We had been to Moses Lake more than once. So we ended up spending most of the time in the house doing nothing, and that turned out to be one of the best vacations!"

If you Plan to visit the fairgrounds this is a perfect place as the commute was 3 minutes or less. It was also outfitted with a nice living room TV and couch for watching your favorite shows or movies if you have some down time. There are quite a few restaurants nearby, and you are also not far out of town. I would recommend this location to anyone traveling into town!"

We preferred Moses Lake to any of the other surrounding towns because the drive home had no twists and turns, and was so easy to navigate even in the dark after the shows.
Robert’s home had everything we needed and was very clean. I’d say it could use a little bit of TLC to really stand out, with more attention paid to the smaller things that would go above expectations, but nothing that hindered our stay in any way. We’d certainly come here again if we find ourselves back at the Gorge."

The living/dining room is so spacious. There's a big tv and sound bar for watching shows/movies and listening to music (we definitely utilized this A LOT during our stay!!). The kitchen looks newly remodeled and very clean. One thing to be mindful of is the low water pressure in the kitchen sink but this didn't hinder anything for us all! We used the dishwasher to clean our dirty dishes and the water faucet by the stove to heat up large portions of water.
Bedrooms and bathroom were nice, clean and comfortable!
Will definitely be staying here if we're ever in Moses Lake again! Thanks Bob and Bonnie! :)"

The home was very clean with all the necessary amenities to include shampoo, conditioner, lotion, qtips, towels, coffee/tea, dishes/utensils, and snacks. The bed was comfortable with nice linens. We had our husky/ lab mix and our chocolate lab with us that thoroughly enjoyed the fenced big back yard. The yard was secure and safe for them to run around while we were able to lounge outside on the deck seated at the outdoor table. We highly recommend staying at this home if you find yourself in Moses Lake!"

Stayed with a pet","This was an amazing place to stay! Robert always communicated quickly and in a timely manner when I contacted him, and the house was beautiful and very neat and clean. All appliances and the interior was new and up to date. Everything matched the photos and description, and it was wonderful to be able to have my pup there. Robert also communicated well about checking in, accessing the home, and using different amenities available there. A lot of care and thought went into making sure we were comfortable in the house, from the big backyard with a deck, table, chairs, and grill, to the restaurant recommendations hanging on the fridge, and the snacks bowl on the counter. If I am ever in Moses Lake again, I will definitely stay here again!"

Stayed with kids","We stayed for 2 nights, had a group of 13 people who were a mix of ages from 53-9 years old and EVERYONE had a fabulous time. The house was well-equipped with plenty of activities, i.e. board games, ping-pong, nerf guns and all sorts of balls for outside for all to engage in. Scott and Alyssa were responsive and helpful all throughout. We had to reach out to them once during our stay because the jacuzzi stopped working, but they came out as soon as they were able to and tried to fix it. Funny thing is after about an hour, it turned back on on it's own.
I highly recommend their home. Thank you, Scott and Alyssa for helping us create new memories."

Group trip","The house was extremely welcoming, cozy and gave a true feeling of home. This get away was to celebrate my daughter’s 16th birthday with 4 of her friends. They had plenty to do to keep entertained (ping pong/pool table, hot tub and basketball court). During the warmer months will add even more adventures to enjoy. Scott was very accommodating and did many things to make sure our stay would be memorable for all of us. Each area of the house was well thought out, the beds were amazing and if you enjoy a good soak the upstairs claw tub is definitely where it’s at. 😊.
I would absolutely recommend this house for all types of stays and couldn’t imagine any person leaving disappointed.
Thank you both for helping me create some great memories for our daughter."

The little deck is a great place to unwind and relax with each other. The pool area is very clean and comfortable as well and we saw some beautiful sunsets from the property. Nicky was quick and friendly with a couple of questions I had and she was respectful of our privacy. I highly recommend Nicky's Lakeside Layover!!"

The condo looks brand new- so much thought went into furnishings and it was so well stocked with kitchen appliances and dishes. Comfy beds and immaculate kitchen and bathrooms.
We love to hike and Nickey directed us to an urban trail right outside the condo. It was a great suggestions and we walked for about 4 miles.
I highly recommend the Paradise Bar and Grill. You can walk there and it is right on the lake.
We will definitely be “laying over “ here again on our way to Spokane or Idaho. But we found Moses Lake is a great destination too. Especially if you like fishing and hiking."

The beds were great, and there are so many neat details that it’s hard to mention everything. There’s lots of space and things to do, and our kids really enjoyed playing games and putting together puzzles that were all provided. Definitely recommend 👍"

Stayed a few nights","This was such a unique place. We came to visit our adult children and new grandbaby, and there was so many fun things to do at this AirBnB, that we spent many hours with everyone playing all the games....shuffleboard, darts, pool, Pacman, pickleball, cornhole, etc.
We really didn't need to contact the host much, but when we did, they immediately responded.
Would definitely recommend."

Stayed with kids","Norm and Lisa’s place was just as described. We went for a family spring break and the kids had a blast with all the stuff to place with- the pool table was the biggest hit!! We spent hours all together playing pool and great barbecue outside!!!
The place was amazing and will be back again."

Stayed one night",The home was very well stocked with all necessities and games for our 2 days we spent in town. The home was easy to access and we enjoyed our stay so much! It’s got plenty of space and tons of activities to do while in the home! Our favorite spot was the back patio with the comfy chairs drinking our coffees in the morning

Stayed one night","This place was clean, comfortable and affordable. I was solo on this trip but this place would have been so much fun with a group of people to use all of the games provided. There is plenty of parking for your truck and boat, or whatever you might be hauling. I had a little issue with the keypad on the door but only because the sun was at the perfect angle to make it difficult to view the screen. The host noticed I was having issues and was quick to try and help via the Ring doorbell. The beds might be the most comfortable I've ever slept in, not kidding.
For the price, this place can't be beat. I will stay here again next time in out this way."

Stayed with kids","The absolutely perfect place to stay! ￼ The best words to describe the space are comfy, cozy, and fun. It was very clean, and we loved having all of the games right there for us to use, we wish we had more time to stay here and play all the games that were available. There was also coffee for us and snacks, which we appreciated so much. ￼The host was wonderful, we are really looking forward to coming back in the near future! ￼"

Hope to come back just to Play!"

Stayed one night","I am a high-level quadriplegic in an electric wheelchair. I have stayed in a lot of Airbnb's the last couple years, as I’ve had much better luck finding places that can accommodate my needs. I love the communication options between hosts and guests.
This place specifically fit all of my needs and was just a fun, comfortable stay. Super roomy, yet cozy. Great communication and honesty by the host! Thanks, we will be back."

Stayed with kids","This has been hands down the BEST place we have stayed at in Moses Lake! You’ll never be bored here. My little family & I had an extended stay (two weeks) & let me just say the place quickly felt cozy & homey. My little one had so much space to play. Lastly but definitely not least our host Norm & Lisa were the sweetest people, they were fast to respond & really thoughtful. Way worth your money! My husband & I would 1000% recommend this place! 🙌"

Stayed with kids","Norm and Lisa's place was exactly what we needed and so much fun! Our two kids were with us and they kept busy playing pool, shuffleboard and of course they loved Pac-Man 😍 The beds were comfy and we slept well. The rest of the apartment was just as comfy. The bathroom had lots of little extras on hand which was a nice added luxury. We appreciated the snacks they had in the kitchen with us getting late after a 3-hour drive. Norm and Lisa have done a beautiful job with the apartment!! We would definitely stay again whenever we're in Moses Lake. Hopefully it will be in warmer weather so we could take advantage of the pickle Court in the backyard!!"

Stayed a few nights","Norm and Lisa thought of everything in this place! They had toiletries in the bathroom in case you forgot something, had ample coffee/tea so you didn't have to buy any before the morning, had lots to do in the home (pool table, PacMan game, shuffle board, board games, ping pong, and even a pickle ball game outside)! There are many other things as well - great beds, sheets, towels, a fire pit, etc.! Also the kitchen was beautiful, and so was the rest of the space. Brand new! Stay here when you go to Moses Lake - you won't regret it!"
