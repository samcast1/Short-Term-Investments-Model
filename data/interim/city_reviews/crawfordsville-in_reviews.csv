Stayed a few nights","Thorntown was quiet and peaceful. Ginger's home was smartly decorated and the beds were as advertised and (previously reviewed). They were super comfy and the air conditioning worked excellently. The downside is that the home could use a little TLC. The walls, door jams, baseboards, etc... all need to be cleaned and painted. The carpet, vinyl (in bathroom & kitchen) and living room drapes are all stained. The rug is so worn that it is buckling in several locations. The bathtub itself was in very good (and clean) shape. But the shower curtain liner was mildewy and needs replaced. The toilet seat probably needs to be replaced too because it was super wiggly. We didn't really use the kitchen, but it appeared to have all that one would need for a stay. I believe if the property had been in better shape, we would have rated it much higher as it is a quiet house in a great location with easy access to Indy and Lafayette."

Our only concern was that it stayed a bit cooler inside the house than we liked. We're from the mountains of Virginia and enjoy keeping things cool back home. It was comfortable inside sometimes, and other times too cool. Especially in the bedrooms. We are thankful to Ginger for hosting us."

Stayed over a week",We would stay here again. We had a long term stay to be near family and it worked out well. Family enjoyed the proximity. A little pricey for us initially but it was worth it for the location. It was nice and warm inside during cold winter days. Shower/bath setup area helpful for those perhaps older and needing to sit during a shower. Short distance to laundry mat available in Lebanon. Host would launder sheets as needed. Deep step up entrance which may be an issue with those with mobility issues but nothing a little aid didn’t remedy. Ginger was very nice and helpful dealing with mobility challenges and limitations.

One thing to note is that this space doesn't have a washer or dryer(which is noted in the listing, so it's not like that's hidden or anything). Would definitely stay a 2nd time."

It is very well-stocked, and you will not run out of linens, TP, garbage bags, etc. There is even body wash/shampoo/conditioner in the shower, an iron and board, blow dryer, etc., if you are looking to pack lighter. Even if you do need something, Ginger responds quickly to help!"

The beds are wonderfully comfortable. The place is spacious enough for large walkers and has no steps except for 3 to get into the front door. The kitchen has all the appliances...even a hand mixer and mixing bowls. It has a wonderful yard if you have kids. It is a short walk to Dollar General. There is a large paved double parking space right up to the house. It only took us 35-40 minutes to get to Indianapolis where our family lives and the route was direct and quickly reached from Thorntown. Any inquiries were answered quickly. There was also the added insurance of the Host living next door if we were really in trouble. I would most highly recommend this lovely place. Ginger our host, is truly a 'Super Host'!"

We traveled to Chicago, Indianapolis, Noblesville, and several other towns and cities. None of the drives seemed very long. The travel theme throughout is adorable. The kitchen had everything we needed. That was a plus since we cooked most meals. The king bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was large and the shower had great pressure and temperature. There are two smart TVs in the house. That was nice for watching a little tv in bed. Kids do ride bikes around in the street and the yard, but they were never loud or intrusive.

The home decor was nice it reminded me of nostalgic times. It had vintage items mixed with contemporary items. Everything was comfortable. The only thing that I would have liked was to be able to watch the local channels or maybe I wasn't able to switch it from cable to local. Otherwise the distance being further than I would like from my niece's place I would stay again there.

We come up once a year to visit and stay in ""our apartment"" for a week or two. We have stayed in both units and love them both. Very shabby chic with tall ceilings and windows. Crawfordsville is 8 miles away with shopping, good eating places, beautiful stately homes and Ben Hur museum. Turkey Run and Shades State Parks are a MUST if you like the outdoors, canoeing and hiking! Hillsboro is first town to the West has a wonderful dinner theater, hardware store and down home country diner. That's a must for us...I go for the apricot pie!
The only down side...you need to be able to handle the steep 20 steps to the apartment. So far, I can still run them to the top!"

Stayed a few nights",We had a really nice stay at Brad's place in Waynestown. We used it as a base camp for hiking at Shades State Park and Turkey Run and were comfortable in the evenings when we were done with our hikes. The apartment was clean and comfortable. The kitchen was well-stocked and had what we needed to cook our own meals in it (which was helpful because there aren't many restaurants in the immediate vicinity). All in all a lovely little place!

There was extra blankets, pillows, linens and plenty of towels. The bathroom was stocked with everything you needed in case you didn’t bring your own toiletries. Nice size tv and lots of seating. The coffee area was fully stocked with everything you needed and more. Over all an awesome stay!"

Group trip","Our family was travelling to the area to attend a wedding at Hidden Hollow Farm. Originally we had not chosen this property or its location but when the cabin we had rented was no longer available for rental the Airbnb representative assisted in securing this location. We could not have been more pleased with the condo or its location near the wedding venue. While generally I would assume there is little to entertain in the small town itself, we were fortunate to have stayed during a festival and an unforgettable fireworks display.
The parking is on the street, we had no difficulty parking near the entrance. There are several steps to reach the upper level of the building which would limit anyone who has difficulty navigating stairs. Once inside we found the condo to be as shown in the pictures, although the pictures are unable to capture how nice it is. We would not hesitate in staying here again."

Stayed a few nights","This is a neat restored old building. Some things to note: There are steep stairs to reach the loft. This was not something I realized when booking. Also the bathroom is located in he primary bedroom, and the second bedroom with bunk beds can only be accessed through the primary bedroom. We had trouble with the AC and could not get the apartment to cool down. There was a large area on the living room wall that had the plaster bubbling and falling off onto the floor. We weren't sure what was going on with that. There was a bit of an old building smell and we were afraid there may have been some mold behind that wall. We ended up canceling our stay after an hour there. The host was accommodating and fully refunded our money and was always available via text or airbnb messaging. We had plenty of notice for our check in and good clear directions. I think the average person could stay there if the above mentioned things didn't bother them."

Stayed a few nights","Neat, historical building.
We did not receive the full address until 30 minutes before our agreed ipon check in time.
Things to know about the unit: there is a steeper flight of 20 steps to get to the unit. If you are sensitive to mildew or musty odors this is not the place for you. We did leave an air freshener plugged in to help with the smells. The bedrooms are adjoining, so you have to walk through the primary bedroom to get to the room with the bunk beds. The bathroom is off the primary bedroom. There is a transom window above the bathroom. One of us slept on the couch and one slept in the bunk room, so as not to disturb one another if someone needed to use the bathroom over night.
There was a live bat in the stairwell during the day time Sunday. We removed it with a shovel."

If staying for more than a day, know that proximity to Shades and Turkey Run state parks, as well as Crawfordsville and even Lafayette is excellent.

There is a country grocery across the street and a great restaurant in Hillsboro (town to the west) which is a must while we are there. We always go to Turkey Run and hike the trails for hours. It’s small town America with a special place in our hearts. You won’t be disappointed.

Stayed with kids","Hello, We stayed at Brad's place over the Thanksgiving Holiday for two days.
We had family in the area, and this was a great alternative to staying in a hotel with the current restrictions. Waynetown, IN. is a great location, next to I-74 and US-231 for going both toward Indianapolis and Lafayette. The area is super quite and next to Pizza King Pizza for the kids. We even went to the Christmas tree farm west of town for our family tree. We had no problems with the hardwood floors or the open floor plan. The apartment is furnished with the antique style furniture from the time period. The kids enjoyed the bunk bed area and the WIFI reception was great. They were happy. We did not have to use the washier or dryer, but it was nice to have the option. The kitchen has everything we need to cook. Brad even has two coffee makers depending on what type of coffee you preferer. The 12 foot plus ceilings were really unique when you are used to standard ranch homes heights. . The weather was cooler, so we were running the heat, so can not comment on the air conditioning. There are ceiling fans in both the master and kitchen area, with speed control, which we really liked. Overall we were happy with the stay."

Stayed with kids","Brads loft is amazing! The listing made it look fun and interesting and it was near where we were planning to go every day so we thought we’d try it. It ended up being so much more amazing than we expected. Here’s some things to know about this awesome location:
1. The shower head was fabulous
2. The coolest room temperature wise is the living area and gets slightly warmer as you go to the back bedrooms with the street side room being the warmest.
3. LOVED having the washer and dryer and they were very up to date ones as well.
4. LOTS of space in the living area.
5. Didn’t need to rent or bring any movies because the smart tv has everything! Also, no DVD player.
6. Lots of counter space! Great for cooking. Bring your own mixing bowls if necessary for your food prep.
7. Dishwasher was a great time saver!
8. The sunset in the evening let’s in the most beautiful light in the living room. ❤️
9. The entrance is in the same building block as pizza king. I kept passing the black door 😂
10. Brad was exceptional at getting back to us promptly for any questions we had."

The kitchen is beautiful, but a little skimpy on cookware, if that is important to you. The fridge has lots of room. The furniture was comfortable, and the smart tv was great to use our Netflix and Hulu accounts. Our son visited in the evenings, and we had a great time. It has a full size washer and dryer with detergent pods and dryer sheets provided. Wonderful. There are two bedrooms, but it is really arranged for a family with kids. The one bathroom is in the master bedroom, and the only entrance to the second bedroom is through the master bedroom. This wasn't a problem for us, but two couples might find this awkward. Brad was a great host. He left several pages of info on restaurants and places to see near-by. Getting in with the door code was easy, and Brad communicated via text, which was all we needed. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely come back!!"

You can actually feel yourself relaxing as you drive through the farms that separate Waynetown from other locals 3.

This was our second stay, but it won't be our last! We've made a resolution to book Mimi's Cottage again in the spring or summer just so we can enjoy the fire pit and the beautiful backyard. Don't hesitate to book here! You won't be disappointed."

This would be a nice place to stay if you were visiting the nearby state park for the weekend.

Stayed a few nights","My spouse and I had a great time here. We were visiting the area from Chicago to see Turkey Run state park (also highly recommended), and ""Mimi's Place"" was perfect--close to the parks, close to town (restaurants, Rotary Jail museum) but also far enough outside of town to feel like we were ""elsewhere"". There are many cute kittens roaming the property, and 12 chickens--Teri encouraged me to feed them scraps. I felt like a kid at the petting zoo--it was great! The cottage is well appointed and very clean. I will say the pull out couch was very uncomfortable, but what pull out couch isn't? Also, the shower is tiny and odd shaped (though typical for airbnb's), and there's a pull out step to get in it, so if you're a larger person or have mobility issues like I do (from a recent car accident) just know that. Teri is super friendly, helpful, and welcoming--eager to talk if you want, but also respectful if you don't. This was the best AirBnB experienced I've had so far. Highly recommended!"

Hosts Teri and Dave are wonderful, kind hosts who thought of detail to make a stay at their cottage enjoyable. Their communication pre-stay was always punctual. When we arrived we were warmly greeted by our host. The cottage is on their property and they do have outdoor cats. Their cats are friendly, but if you aren't a cat lover please know that their cats are quiet, well mannered and will keep their distance.
The cottage is just as it appears in the photos. It is immaculate, and has all amenities needed for a comfortable stay. We have stayed in many Airbnb properties in America and in Europe over the past 8 years and Mimi's Cottage is one of the loveliest and cleanest we've experienced.
I highly recommend Mimi's Cottage."

I got a message from the host after booking that the internet isn’t reliable. That would be nice to know ahead of booking since I’ll sometimes choose a place based on if it has internet or not. With that being said, I come from a city and understand that it is sometimes common knowledge that the internet isn’t always reliable when you’re more remote."

Stayed a few nights","Teri and Dave were great hosts; they even let us drop off our bags at the Airbnb since we arrived early so we could go hiking. They even told us about some of their favorite trails which we decided to check out and we loved them to. They are very gracious hosts, very kind and the Airbnb was stocked with everything we could have needed. Bed was super comfy and so were the sheets! Lots of towels, extra blankets and pillows too. We love hiking at Shades State Park and their Airbnb is about 4 minutes away. This is our 2nd visit and we will be back, especially to bring our grandkids so they can play with the kitties, on the swing set and to get them use to hiking. Super hosts all around!"

Location is close to Turkey Run And Shades State Parks, and much nicer than staying in the park cabins. Location is quiet with a big fenced yard, and we were allowed to bring our 2 little dogs. They had a blast and had to be coaxed into the car with treats when it was time to leave. They were ready to move in!
Teri and Dave are very kind and flexible hosts…make that super hosts!"

The apartment is thoughtfully arranged and I could see it was stocked for longer stays too, including games and books for kids. We loved having fresh eggs to cook for breakfast the next morning, that was a real treat! I'd love to come back and stay when I could spend a week or more and explore the parks and covered bridges in the area. Teri & Dave provided lots of useful maps and helpful info for spending time there and exploring all there was. I highly recommend you plan a visit."

This is certainly one of the most serene places we have ever stayed! The cottage itself is more than adequate, and cleverly furnished, but the atmosphere of the grounds is so very beautiful and peaceful. It is located away from traffic, and other city aggravations which allows a truly relaxed “time away”. So don’t complain about the short drive, it’s definitely worth it! There is a “group” of chickens (although no “nosiy” roosters) that provides you with fresh eggs - where do you get that? We cannot say enough about our hosts! Fifteen minutes after meeting them, I wanted to adopt them into our family! So very cordial, helpful, sincere and fun! The only issue, as I see it, will be reservations at the quaint cottage…..as word gets out about Mimi’s, it will be harder and harder to reserve - it’s THAT great!"

Check in is super easy and Teri was always quick to reply to questions. Our first morning I couldn't get the Keurig machine to work and within minutes she was at the door with another one!
The kitchen and bathroom were well stocked. They had everything needed for our weeks stay. The bed was comfortable and the hot water in the shower was welcomed after a day at the lake.
I traveled with an 8 year old that was obsessed with Teri and Dave's kittens and they were so patient with him wanting to play with the kittens all the time.
I really enjoyed feeding our food scraps to the chickens. They were always excited when we came out to feed them.
Checkout was as smooth as the checkin and I can't wait to return next summer!"

Stayed one night","One of THE BEST airbnb experiences we've ever had. This lovely rental is perfection. Teri was an amazing host...allowing us to stop past early to drop off our things before we ventured out. Check-in was very easy. Upon our arrival, we were greeted by the hosts and quickly recognized how special this place was. It was clean/immaculate. It was private, quiet, cozy. The rental was well appointed -- it had everything needed for a short (or long!) stay....the kitchen had plenty of utensils, plates, etc. The bed was comfortable with plenty of linens. And we were surprised at how big the bathroom was! And it had everything a guest may need -- from soap to shampoo to toothbrushes and so on -- along with plenty of towels! The hosts have paid attention to many little details...even labeling some of the light switches, etc. so guests know what goes with what. And the fresh eggs (from the onsite chickens) were wonderful! While our trip was quick (a 24 hour getaway!) I truly wish we could've lingered longer. We spent a day hiking at Shades State Park (just a short 3 miles drive) ... enjoyed dinner in the small town of Waveland ... spent some time on the small patio just talking and enjoying the peace and quiet... and were grateful for these accommodations. I would highly recommend this airbnb to anyone -- and hope we can return in the future! Definitely a gem -- and a real treasure -- in a beautiful part of the great state of Indiana!"

The guest house is lovely and just enough for us. Also, it was really lovely to wake up to the sound of the birds. She also is a very likable person which is an added plus.

Great 12-ft ceilings and plenty of room good furnishings and appliances and well appointed kitchen. P great location near a small town square. Very walkable downtown area with lots of restaurants and shops. Fantastic lighting from the tall living room windows and some Hilton Creeks add to the charm of the space. Space is very private and quiet in late afternoon and evenings after all the businesses are closed.
multiple problems with front door lock. Management was responsive to address the issue."

Stayed a few nights","If I could I would give this place 3.5 stars. It looks just like the pictures, had the amenities it said and overall was fine. The directions in the listing seemed very clear and I had no questions. However, upon arriving there I realized they were not as clear as it seemed. The back door listed for use is an emergency exit that will sound if opened. I could not get warm water from bathroom sink unless i turned on the shower first (to all the way hot). The shower itself was fine but the water is a different story. It was luke warm at best. Happy it was a short stay and could avoid having to wash my hair. There is no heat in the place. They do have an electric fireplace in bedroom and a space heater but we didnt use so not sure how well they work. Only 1 extra throw blanket provided if cold. Lots of stairs to unit. Sundays most things are closed in the immediate walking distance. It was fine but not likely to stay again."

The cottage is really comfortable and immediately feels like home. The kitchen is fabulous. No amenity is lacking. We enjoyed being there in the summer spending time on the expansive deck for playing games and al fresco meals. The dock was a great place for reading books and watching the activity on the lake. A drive to Turkey Run State Park for lunch and hiking rounded out our visit with family.

From the moment we arrived, we were captivated by the serene surroundings, and the tranquil atmosphere. The house itself was an oasis of calm, offering the perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of every day life. The location of the house provided a sense of privacy and seclusion that enhance the overall experience. The house was well appointed, and had everything needed for a comfortable state. The interior west, he’s fully decorated, with the cozy furnishings and thoughtful touches that made us feel right at home. The spacious living area and fully equipped kitchen or ideal for both unwinding and preparing meals. Overall, our experience at the Sweet house was unforgettable. If you’re seeking a peaceful getaway, surrounded by natural beauty, I highly recommend considering this hidden gem for the next escape."

The place was clean and comfortable, and the kitchen had every possible utensil, dish and appliance we could have needed. The beds were very comfortable and there were plenty of towels and linens (including pillows) for our group. The cottage had so many special touches, including a pack and play and lots of toys for our grandson, and great internet. The private back deck was amazing and we spent a lot of time out there, and also watched a family of owls in the trees all week which was very cool. The property is lakefront with a private dock, great for fishing and is located in a private lakeside community. We took many walks through the neighborhood. We have stayed in many air bnbs over the years and this one is right at the top! We would definitely stay again if we find ourselves in the area! Thank you Susan and Kevin!"

The reason we gave it a 2 star rating was because there was a camera in the dining room that was on and we did not feel comfortable. We also know that Airbnb is okay with public cameras in the house, but we didn’t know there was one inside or we wouldn’t have chosen this rental. The owner did later mention that it was for their dogs and we could disconnect it, but we just were not comfortable afterwards. We couldn’t stay and left after a couple hours there."

The street is a highway, but traffic is light and the area is quiet. Waynetown’s downtown is small, but there is a Pizza King, a small but nice liquor store, a market, and an antique mall all within a half-block of the apartment. We definitely recommend the place as long as you’re ok climbing stairs."

The amenities were complete and useful; the linens comfortable; the bathroom was spacious and clean; and, the TV set up easy to manage.

Stayed over a week","We stayed at Brad's place for about three weeks. The place is sparkly clean, extremely spacious, very private, and quite stylish, with all basic amenities included (pots, pans, cooking / dining utensils, plenty of towels, etc.). Brad was very prompt and professional in communication, and he provided local guides in airbnb too. The airbnb, as lots of other reviewers have noted, is located on the second floor at the end of a steep flight of stairs. Across the street is the town's family grocery store (the moderate chain store is right down the street, though you might want to drive to Laffy for real grocery hauls), and it is close to Shade State Park. Overall it was a wonderful stay and great value. Side note on the washer - it is a stackable one and has handwash cycle that doesn't tear up or ruin your clothes."

It’s only about 35-40 minutes drive to Lafayette where there is plenty to do. Crawfordsville is not too far away and offers some entertainment/nice park as well as a Kroger and other places to shop. The apartment was cozy and clean! We loved the high ceilings and the dark wooden floors. The bed was comfy and this place has nice furniture. Couldn’t ask for much more for the price."

We are used to sleeping in a King-size bed at home, and switching to a full-size bed took us some getting used to. Other than that, we can’t say enough good things about this place. Yes, like everyone points out, the stairs are a little steep, but they’re no problem for the average person. We will definitely be returning!"

Stayed a few nights","This apartment flat is a great spacious, clean, secure, well appointed, stocked, modern but minimalistic space with tons of visually appealing historic character. Unit is located in an exceedingly small, peaceful, one traffic light, authentic midwestern town, but within 18 minutes to typical town amenities such as an AMC movie theatre, Kroger grocery store, shopping (Gordmans, Walmart, Dollar stores, Goodwill, etc) chain restaurants, local flavor restaurants (close early) etc. This unit is also within 25 minutes to some of the best rugged hiking trails Indiana has to offer. Stairs to this space are more than standard in number and steep, perhaps not suitable for those with mobility issues, but well worth it for those who are able to climb stairs. Pull out sofa bed in living room has adjustable head positions, but does not lay flat and though there is a memory foam topper it may be more of an acquired taste for those wishing to sleep on it. The queen size bed in the master en-suite feels more like a full size, but is very cozy and comfortable with memory foam. Overall this is an incredibly awesome and relaxing space for 2 people wishing to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life etc."

Everything I needed I was able to find, and appreciated modern comforts. Extensive TV choices. Amazingly clean...I felt like I was the first guest! I appreciated provided regular and decaf coffee plus creamer. Consider bringing a few breakfast items with you since options in town are pretty limited. The stairs are steep as described but not a problem. Ample parking right in front. Extremely quiet little town."

We spent most of our time hiking in the state parks. But in Waynetown, we visited an amazing, old graveyard that is interesting to walk through, and a friendly corner grocery store. I went into the store to buy some ibuprofen. They were out of stock, but the friendly cashier insisted on sharing some of hers since they were out. Small town kindness!!!"

When I arrived Deb and her husband were busy making syrup, but she made certain to take the time to greet me to make me feel welcome/safe due to the fact I was traveling alone. The home itself is spacious and SPOTLESSLY clean and is equipped with everything I needed to be comfortable. The bed is amazing and the linens were a very nice quality - all details I truly appreciate. The couch was comfortable and clean and felt brand new. Deb even left a homemade biscuit with delicious honey harvested from their own bees. I was unable to thoroughly enjoy the grounds due to the weather, but the views out the many windows were calming and full of nature. I actually drove a bit out of my way to stay at this guest house, but I'm so very glad I did. If I ever have the opportunity to return to the area I will check availability of Deb's place before reserving another. Fantastic value for the money."

Stayed one night",I am so thankful I found this new gem for my semi annual turkey run and shades visits. Deb’s property is seated perfectly between them. And offers a beautiful relaxing spot to unwind from busy days of hiking. It was so clean and relaxing and the kitchen was perfectly stocked to make an amazing breakfast. And the biscuits and fresh honey left for us were just a perfect touch!

We arrived late at night, and the next morning, we woke to a peaceful and beautiful view out of the large windows. We enjoyed a fabulous night's sleep in the comfortable bed and the quiet setting. It was difficult to tear ourselves away, and we ended up leaving hours later than we had planned.
The guest house was welcoming, comfortable, and spotlessly clean!
We are already planning a return visit!
Thank you,Deb!!!"

We got to watch the deer and cardinals looking outside the many windows facing the woods. It was too cold to explore but we would have loved to check out the woods and meet their dogs Ike and Bean (which was encouraged). There was a firm, adjustable bed, two mini splits for heating and cooling, and a small wall heater in the bathroom. The place had plenty of room for my husband and me to relax and be comfy. There were instructions for the house, the tv, the wifi, and the heaters. There was a small Keurig and some k-cups, creamer, and sweetener choices. If we were to stay longer there was plenty of cookware and dishes. The price was fair and Deb even left us some cinnamon rolls which were yummy for breakfast in the morning! We had a very pleasant stay and would go back for sure! Thanks Deb!"

We had 8 guests, all adults, and the house was amazingly spacious, comfy, and inviting. The beds were super comfortable and the house was stocked with everything we could have needed.

Stayed a few nights","If you’re looking for a peaceful retreat in the beautiful wilderness of Western Indiana, the Farmhouse Hideaway is ideal. My extended family and I found ourselves in need of lodging for a wedding in nearby Crawfordsville. Considering all our criteria – proximity, budget, size, desired amenities – this presented a challenge. The Hideway was almost too good to be true! The house is charming and historic but with all the modern features you expect. It is spacious and comfortable for several adults. The real value, though, is the access to 200+ acres of remote farmland with ponds, creeks, and hiking trails through the woods. There is even a creekside picnic area. Jenny, our host, was incredibly helpful and accommodating, responding to messages almost immediately. She even made a special trip to purchase some unusual household items we requested. I can't recommend the Farmhouse Hideaway highly enough."

Stayed a few nights","Such a perfect place for a family reunion. My siblings traveled from their respective homes in Arizona, Oregon and Japan. Five of us comfortably stayed together for a week. We had my mom, who resides in a nursing home, spend the day with us, for 2 of the days. Plenty of room to spread out & dining room large enough to accommodate us for all our meals, along with a few other relatives, who joined us for a couple of dinners. The property was just beautiful & fun to explore and discover. While the location may have seemed remote, groceries were available near by, and it was only a half hour drive to the nursing home my mom was in. My siblings and I will definitely use it again, the next time we have a chance to get together again."

As a group of 5 older women who like to hike and then hang out and enjoy each other’s cooking and company, this well appointed older farm house delivers just what we needed. It’s a bit remote, so plan to bring what you will need - although you can find lots of cool stuff at the Coal Creek Country Store just a mile or so down the road. The Hideaway is spotlessly clean and the beds are comfortable…unless you draw the short straw and sleep in the built in bunks. They work best for kids.
Anyway, a very well priced and much appreciated home away from home!"

While we weren't there for the state parks this time, the proximity to Turkey Run and Shades State Parks is great! And there are little things that go a long way---cleanliness, quality of linens, towels, and toiletry products. Those things were some nice finishing touches. The current owners have only had the property a couple of years and they've already made huge strides in updating and remodeling (work is ongoing). Will be back!"

Stayed with kids","This place is far and beyond amazing. This is something to cherish there is a peace that rests upon this place. In this day and age peace is far worth more than gold! The house was clean, bedrooms spacious, and just all around gorgeous. Its an absolute blessing to share this property with others to come dwell in as their own. Have been too many airbnbs this supercedes them all! I can write a book but about the experience but I'll stop here and let you create your own book as soon as you enter this property."

The hiking trail, the gazebo, and the pond were definitely a great addition to this home. The wifi was a little bit spotty so we had to reset it a couple of times. But, that didn't ruin our time this weekend. We were still able to soak in the sun and make more memories together. I recommend this place if you are trying to find some quietness and relaxation."

There were so many things we loved including the large round dining room table, huge full length mirrors, gazebo, and more. This is a large farmhouse with great spaces to spread out. There were several tables as well as more comfortable seating options. You could easily put small children to bed far enough away not to be disturbed or close enough to keep an eye on them. The king sized bed was comfortable. The heated floor in the sunroom was a sweet surprise. The tv was equipped with Roku, Satalite, and a DVD player. This place is so versatile. It is perfect for a large family, romantic getaway or friends/family get together."

The additions of lots of acreage to roam and a fish pond stocked with fish you can feed were bonuses on top of the spacious farmhouse. Check in and out were super simple. We imagine this place is even more beautiful in the spring and summer when the flower gardens are in full bloom. Two state parks are within a 30 minute drive, as well as numerous covered bridges."

The house is the cleanest I have ever stayed in. You could literally smell the clean. Plenty of pots And pans for cooking. Great ice maker, and plenty of hot water and good pressure. House heated up quickly, and the washer and dryer are top line.

Stayed over a week","My family of 3 had the most memorable stay at the Hideaway! We lived at Jenny & Patrick's farmhouse for a monthlong quarantine during Covid and we literally felt like family! Anytime we had a question or needed something, our hosts were ready to deliver... including hand delivered sweets from Jenny's bakery and some good ol' Hoosier Hospitality. The property itself was ideal, with 270 acres to explore, a pond with catfish & bluegills to feed/fish, an amazing bonfire, the most exceptional wraparound veranda, a wonderful gazebo, and countless trails to walk thru the forest or along the onsite creek! The house was beautifully managed and updated and there was a ton of space for our family to make our own. The sunroom was where we spent most of our indoor time and even on the rainy days, it delivered outstanding views of the property. Our family cannot wait to come back and bring friends/family to share our experience with others. Thank you so much Jenny & Patrick! Hamilton sends ""Air Hugs""! :)"

Group trip","While the home was beautiful, there were a few things that didn't live up to expectations. For a home this large for this many people, it often means there is an event happening. I needed to iron clothes for my son's graduation from college and while I found the iron (not a good one), there was no ironing board anywhere. I thought I missed it and messaged the host, but she said there was no ironing board. I had to iron a lot of clothing very awkwardly on a towel on the counter. We also wanted to make a few meals, however, again, for the amount of people this home can accommodate, the kitchen was EXTREMELY bare bones. Not even bowls for cereal and the cooking utensils were dollar store quality. All that being said, the living space is very large and the grounds were beautiful. A note before you book; realize there are only 2 showers and one is in a bedroom, so not super accessible to all guests."

If you want to feel like you are staying at a friend’s home - this is the place.
The sense of peace in this home was palpable. It’s the most cozy airbnb I have ever stayed in.
This is an ideal place for a refreshing, relaxing stay. I was nervous about our grandkids visiting because the home is filled with pretty things and only one small tv (no gaming system!). But the kids were respectful of the home and had a great time playing outside and playing board games together. It was amazing!! Even my adult kids who would normally watch football or other shows, sat around and talked to each other. The kitchen is big and was a great space for a crowd of hungry kids.
Everything we needed was there (besides our food).
I loved being there and I hope to return in the future!"

The kitchen had everything you needed. The house was a perfect fit. Bathrooms were on the main level, they had everything you would need. The Host baked cookies for our arrival that we’re out of this world delicious. If you are looking to host a large family/friend event, this is the place to do it. Our only disappointment was the weather didn’t allow us to enjoy the beautiful backyard patio and fire pit.

They kitchen was so well stocked, and they even brought over fresh garden vegetables for us. Our 12 year old grandson had a great time with the outdoor games and basketball goal. We spent each evening around the fire pit roasting marshmallows and star gazing. This beautiful home and grounds are a peaceful place to relax and renew relationships away from our usual busy and stressful lives."

Stayed with kids","We needed a house in the Crawfordsville area for my son's wedding. Our daughters and their families stayed with us. The house was so welcoming and comfortable. It was peaceful and had everything we needed and more. I had all of the grooms clothes plus some bridesmaid dresses, and the house had the perfect closet to accommodate all of these extra clothes. When the hostess met my grand girls, she brought out toys for them to play in the gravel area. There are amazing places to sit and enjoy the beautiful scenery and even a walking path which my daughter used to run. They knew why we were there and went the extra mile to make sure we had everything we needed. It was honestly the best Airbnb experience we have had and we have had some good ones. They had great recommendations for us for food, church, etc. The hostess met us when we arrived, and we loved talking with her. It also made everything so easy because she showed us everything."

The host and hostess thought of everyone and everything when providing amenities to make our stay wonderful. The host and hostess themselves were on property and available if there were any issues or problems. They are delightful people.

They have thought of absolutely everything you might need. It truly feels you are staying with friends. The communication was excellent, and they really care about you as a person. I could go on and on, but you will just have to experience it for yourself. Words just can’t describe the house and hosts well enough."

Throughout our stay she checked in to make sure we continued to have everything we need. Communication is incredible! We arrived late at night early morning so we checked in super late. When we woke up there were yummy donuts left for our family, which was so thoughtful. The property is amazing you can tell that Jeannie and Curtis pay close attention to detail. The house is very clean and beautifully decorated. My kids had so much fun with the outdoor space. They loved the basketball goal, the fire pit, and the open space.

It was the perfect weekend and made the perfect location for my Mom’s 70th birthday.
Jeannie and Curt are amazing.
From the first communication with her, I knew this was going to be an incredible getaway.
They are so attentive to every need while you are there.
The house has everything you could possibly need.
They were gracious enough to let us add decor and a balloon arch for the celebration, which only added to the houses charm and character.
We have never stayed at an Airbnb with this kind of hospitality from the host.
Jeannie and Curt treat you like family.
The home is so lovely and the property is beautiful.
We never once turned on a TV the whole weekend. It was so peaceful and the sunrises and sunsets were spectacular.
You feel like you are in the middle of nowhere, but there are several restaurants, shops and grocery stores within a few miles.
The beds were super comfy and the nights were very quiet.
You will want to go back!
We truly enjoyed our stay at His Harvest Home.
Also, the fresh baked cookies waiting for you are SO YUM."

The drive to West Lafayette was simple and a straight shot- but staying in Crawfordsville gave us the opportunity to get away and visit and connect as a family. We chose to make dinner in the home and the kitchen was very well-equipped for everything we needed. All of Jeannie’s recommendations we’re very helpful and her special touches very much appreciated. I was initially concerned about one shower but it turned out not to be an issue as everyone got up at different times and it worked out fine. Jeannie and Curt thank you for your hospitality.

Group trip","I reserved this home almost a year ago when my daughter decided to have her wedding at a local venue. Jeannie was communicative from the start and as the date came closer even more so, asking about needs for children, sleeping arrangements etc.
We arrived at the home and it is every bit what is depicted in the pictures and description, even better. Jeannie and Curt could not be more gracious hosts and ensured that before we arrived that we had staples such as coffee, creamer, water, even home baked cookies that were outstanding, (thank you for sharing the recipe). Every day they shared fresh watermelon and peppers from the garden and by the end of a few days it seemed as if we had known them for years. The home has been lovingly restored and has all the right touches, it was meticulously clean and we did not want for anything.
I travel for living and am pretty fussy about accommodations and Jeannie and Curt's home exceeded our expectations. If ever in Central Indiana again, we would not hesitate to stay here, great home, great people."

Stayed with kids","Beautiful country setting, close to town, thoughtful hosts, clean, stylish furnishings- these are only the first thoughts of many, many positives that come to mind when reflecting on our time at Jeannie’s place. This home and hosts exceeded our expectations (which is hard to do, we are particular and picky). Our family loved spending time in the kitchen together, sitting out in the back yard over a campfire in the evening, and watching the kids play in the large mowed yard. We will be back. Thank you again Jeannie!"

They even helped set up our rehearsal dinner for us! We felt like we were actually staying with family. The house and property is GORGEOUS and gave us a sunset to never forget for our rehearsal dinner. The decor feels like something right out of HGTV! I cannot say enough great things about this stay. If you’re ever in crawfordsville don’t stay anywhere else! I know we will be back for sure!! Thank you thank you thank you!!"

Our son made use of the basketball net and when they noticed the ball was flat a new basketball was brought over.
They shared their lettuce harvest with us and we enjoyed that during our stay.
Jeannie responds to text messages right away."

Stayed a few nights",This is a charming home! It’s perfect for a couple or a group. We stayed here for my son’s graduation from Wabash (which is about 5 minutes away). The home has every convenience so you can make a meal. And has a spectacular outdoor space. We were able to host a group of about 15 for an evening meal. Each room and space has its own charm- from the front porch rockers to watching the sun rise from bed. My only disappointment is that we found this when my son was graduating! Otherwise this would have been our regular stay.

The house was so cozy and dreamy, and the outside/location was very peaceful! There was plenty of space outside for outdoor activities with the kids, the kitchen had everything needed to prepare meals, there was plenty of room to lounge and teach a little school to the kiddos, and the beds were very comfortable! Sweet reminders behind the story of the family home made it one that will always be remembered. My family didn’t want to leave :)...we will definitely be making another trip in the future. Memories were made and my heart is full!!"

Stayed a few nights","You must stay here!
As we drove down the scenic country road, up the beautifully kept driveway, I felt transported to a simpler time.
The ""Harvest Home"" served as our family head quarters for my brother's PhD graduation at Purdue. While a 40 minute drive away from campus, it was absolutely WORTH it!
When searching for a place, I was struck but the ""homey"" feel of the photos, but what we found as we walked through the door was SO much more. This home was built in the early 20th century, where 8 children were raised (the youngest of whom is your host) and you can just feel the love and pride that was taken in refurbishing this home.
The farmhouse is the perfect balance of old- vintage claw feet tub, vanities, original stairs, repurposed barn door and handcrafted furniture, and new- excellent plumbing and hot water, new appliances, a large island for food prep and breakfast buffet.
If you're worried about the ""off the grid"" description, don't because your data still works. But honestly, it was so nice being able to unplug, sit outside by the gas fireplace under the pergola with my family and just breathe.
Having traveled to third world countries and mother to a little baby, I am a bit anal about cleanliness. I am pleased to report that the floors, bedrooms, bathrooms, sheets and grounds (I took a nap under the whimsical willow tree) were spectacularly kept! And also, being in the countryside, I was a bit concerned about bugs but thankfully, we had zero issues with that.
To close, you will not find better, more gracious hosts than Jeannie and her husband, Curtis. They are incredible people who go above and beyond to make you feel at home from homemade cookies, to ""hey, if you need herbs, grab them from the garden"". They have been my favorite AirBnB hosts to date.
Godspeed to all, and if He takes you to Indiana, staying at the ""Harvest Home"" will enrich your journey."

This would be the PERFECT place for a larger family to come and just hang out. The fire pits were great, and although we didn't need to burn anything because of the weather, we did sit out and enjoy the unobstructed sunset from the pergola. Jeannie and Kurt were fantastic hosts. And the facilities they have are top-notch. I would recommend this home to anyone. We will be back!"

""No, it's Indiana.""
Okay, the Field of Dreams quote really refers to Iowa, but when we arrived at the idyllic His Harvest Home, set amid the cornfields of Crawfordsville, we knew we were in a very special place.
From the photos Jeannie had posted, I was guardedly hopeful that this farmhouse would be the perfect place for a mini family reunion. Jeannie and Curtis more than exceeded my expectations. And I am not one to exaggerate.
The home is beautiful. It's an historic farmhouse -- completely restored, while remaining true to its history. Jeannie's thoughtful decorative touches were everywhere. And we were very appreciative of the fresh produce she shared from her garden.
We will definitely be back."

Though it's very close to town, it feels secluded and peaceful as it's surrounded by corn fields and gardens on all sides. Jeannie was a fantastic host. She was extremely hospitable, welcoming, and accommodating. If we are ever in Crawfordsville again, we will absolutely stay at ""His Harvest Home."""

I couldn't have made a better choice. It was easy to find; their directions were step-by-step perfect; and the suite was cozy and beautifully decorated. The designers had maximized the space. I wish I had a reason to stay for a week. If I were a Depauw University parent, this is where I'd stay for every visit.
The good: warm, comfortable bed; spacious bathroom; good snacks; large refrigerator; plenty of electrical outlets; easy check-in; easy parking; responsive hosts.

The bad: nothing. It was all good and within striking distance of a tremendous mountain biking park in Terre Haute, which I thoroughly enjoyed."

Stayed a few nights","Great hosts. Place was very clean. Good location, pretty much right in the middle of Green Castle.
Their descriptions of low ceilings are accurate. I'm 6'3 and I didn't have a problem with the ceilings, but I didn't account for the duct work that is down there. I had to duck under those. But no complaints, it's a great little spot, comfortable, and convenient for us."

Stayed a few nights","Troy and Teresa's place was absolutely perfect. Troy and Teresa are truly good, caring people. It is a private space with a private entrance, and you only know they're there if you text them for something. I didn't need anything, but I wanted to tell Teresa how lovely and welcoming her place was, and she responded right away. Her attention to detail made all the difference. She thought of everything and truly wants you to have a nice experience. I really didn't want to go to my seminar once I entered their place. I felt like I was on a mini-vacay and just wanted to relax in the most comfortable bed ever and enjoy the solitude in my little piece of heaven. But duty always calls;) Bottom line: I wouldn't stay anywhere else. Thank you Teresa and Troy, for a wonderful experience!"

Stayed one night","Troy's place was wonderful! Troy was very responsive to our questions/texts. My husband and I were enroute to Moab, UT from Maryland and just needed a place to sleep and clean up. The space is a true getaway ambiance, both inside and out. One thing my husband mentioned, being 6'1"", is that the ceilings were a low for him. I'm 5' 5"" so I didn't even notice. Just something to consider if you're staying there for a few days and you're tall. However, there are a lot of small shops and restaurants within walking distance that we missed out on because of the short stay. The DePaw Campus is nice to walk around and lots of fun things to see and experience. Troy's Place is peaceful, quaint and very comfortable. I would, absolutely, recommend staying there and for a longer visit."

Troy and Teresa were always accessible and helpful. . . truly wonderful, reliable hosts. Their hideaway accommodations were literally a two-minute walk from our son's fraternity house during a recent weekend visit. We were delighted with a comfortable, cozy, and quiet respite from an event-filled weekend on campus. Guests will enjoy the sleek and modern feel to Troy and Teresa's place; everything is updated with a tasteful relaxing feel, from the plush and inviting bedding and rustic-style armoire to the invigorating shower and spacious, spotless bathroom. My wife and I experienced an almost California wine country feel here, a calming getaway that we will surely keep in mind for future visits to DePauw!"

Stayed a few nights","Troy and Teresa are the best. The apartment was great, super clean. They had a coffee maker, a fridge with filtered water and some snacks. What a treat!
But the highlight was when I got back in the evening after my conference, they were sitting outside and having conversations with a guest as well as their daughter and invited me to join. I had a wonderful time. The second day same thing happened but just the two of them were sitting there and having a chat and I joined them. It was a fantastic discussion And this really was an added bonus to me.
I would very highly recommend this for anyone visiting DePauw University. It is very close and walking distance and is a very nice neighborhood."
