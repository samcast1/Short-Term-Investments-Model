Stayed a few nights","D’s space is a gorgeous, spacious loft with great amenities in an excellent location. Huge open kitchen, separate dining area, huge bedrooms with comfy beds and fine linens, tons of huge, clean bathrooms and great chill entertaining space. The loft is in the heart of downtown in a stunning historic building surrounded by a range of dining options and nightlife options. One of my best airbnb stays and where I’ll stay when I’m next in St. Louis."

the house is just beautiful, can't stress how immaculate the place was.
since I'll be visiting stl often with a new grand baby coming, I'll be back here."

The stairs in the back are super steep - not a negative impact on my score, just wanted to let folks know! If you have physical limitations, it may be hard to get in from the back. (But it is worth it!)"

Check in was super easy and self explanatory. I instantly felt comfortable upon walking into the house. It was incredibly clean, organized and exactly as pictured. Very spacious, open concept living area. Unbelievably comfortable beds. I don’t think I’ve slept that good in a long awhile!
Definitely loved the fire pit and hot tub too! It was one of the reasons I chose to stay here. Such a cool (and private) spot to sit and hang out even though it was cold.
Mark was very responsive to my messages which is always appreciated. I would definitely stay again and recommend anyone else to as well, if you’re in St. Louis for any occasion."

Stayed a few nights","Mark is an excellent host. He's quick at responding ad resolving issues. That said there were some broken items which were reported to Mark and he got right on it to schedule things to be fixed. If you don't do steep stairs, then you won't be able to access the patio. The stairs leading up to front door are easy to manage. The back steps, steps to basement, and steps from basement up to hot tub are quite steep. I didn't know this when booking so I thought I'd share."

Instructions for everything, top notch toiletries, clean kitchen with everything needed. It was located close to where we needed to be for our business. Hosts were more than attentive to any need we had. If I was to say anything negative it would be, that it's not for the handicap or people that have a hard time getting up stairs. Other than that, it's the cleanest, and most relaxing AirBnB we have been to in a long time."

The Barn, even though it is next to the highway, is very quiet on the inside, and this is coming from someone who is a light sleeper. There is literally anything you need in this place, even to-go food containers if you cook too much food in the well-stocked kitchen. The outdoor space you share is spacious for the city and their dog, Luna, is a fantastic host as well and will only ask you for some scratches. The drive to most of downtown only took about 20 minutes, and the neighborhood you're in has a ton of amenities and restaurants. Gill even recommended some local restaurants for us to go to for our anniversary. By far one of our favorite stays!"

Stayed a few nights","Gill and Cindy are wonderful hosts. They and their friendly dog greeted us when we arrived and made sure to say goodbye when departed. Gill gave us a flexible check-out -- they clean the Airbnb themselves, which was pristine. Gill built the loft above the barn in a practical way: you walk into a large kitchen to the left with an area to sit, an area to hang coats, sit to remove your shoes and stow them under the bench. The bathroom has a mirror with a cabinet and plenty of shelves. There's a walk-in closet by the bed and a window between the bed and sofa. The desk extends from the wall and converts into a Murphys bed. In short, the Barndominium feels bigger than it is due to the thoughtful layout. Although it's near a highway, it is well insulated to drown out most of the vehicular noise. The property slopes down, and there are 14 steps to the Airbnb. This was not an issue for us. When it snowed, Gill removed the slush from the steps. We'd definitely stay there again."

It is quiet, private and comfortable. The hosts had everything you could ever need if you managed to forget it. Everything was nicely labeled and they even had a small message welcoming us during our stay. Truth be told, I have never stayed at a place that had so much helpful information from the get go. It was great to not only have the area's info in the welcome binder but there were tips and coupons in case you needed them.
Overall, the barndominium was an awesome stay. If you love dogs, make sure to catch Luna when she is out and about, she is such a sweetheart. The hosts were also very attentive in letting us know if the dog was about or if something needed our attention. Definitely a 10/10 stay and will look for it again if I'm in St Louis."

Gill and Cindy are the type of host that draws me to AirBNB, with a beautiful and cozy home away from home without the feeling of just another number at a hotel.
The accommodations were first rate and we would love to stay again in the future."

Gill was very responsive to our questions, concerns, and even let us know about the company coming to pour concrete during our stay.

Many special touches in the amenities included and I could tell that thought was given to the guest-experience. Nice toiletries, and everything you could need; in the kitchen there were even to-go containers for taking food home. Homey feel in a spacious living space. Felt private and great for family or solo trip; I used part of my time for a work/thinking retreat and this was a great space for that.
Many items for entertainment (little games, DVDs...). Bed & bedding were very comfortable. Black out shades were a plus. Location was about 15-20 min to downtown area, which was great for me; easy drive on the highway. Gill was great about communicating throughout with clear instructions, and even taking thoughtful care when it had snowed, to clear the snow and salt the walkways.
It was exactly what I needed and I will definitely come again when in the area."

Stayed a few nights","This home was very clean, great location, and quiet neighborhood.
It has a shared parking space with the owner, we had to park next to the fence so they could get their cars out of the garage. I have a mini van, so it was harder for me to work with the space. There was no close place to park next to the house we were staying in.
There are a lot of stairs going down to the house and then steep stairs going up. If you bring a lot of luggage (be aware!), however, Gill was more than happy to help us with our items.
We were greeted by Gill (who is very nice) but we were promptly asked if we were vaccinated. I don’t believe that was appropriate, so do be aware this is important to his family. I agree with precautions and whatever makes you feel safe (vaccinated or not), but it is a personal choice and shouldn’t have to be disclosed. We were not staying in his main home, but “mother in law” home on his property.
Over all - the stay was quiet, convenient and reasonable priced."

One thing I really appreciated was the filtered water dispenser that is built in to the sink so if you are a fellow water drinker you are covered. The space looks just like the pictures and parking was not a problem thanks to the allotted space in the driveway. This is a great stay that I will be looking forward to staying in again.

Gill even grilled us some ribeyes that we purchased and it was better than going to any steakhouse that we’ve ever tried. There was great conversation throughout our stay with them both. Any questions were answered quickly and with precise direction. The place was cozy and private and not much road noise was heard even with it being close to the highway. Great hospitality.

Felt much bigger than an apartment, the bathroom was fantastic, the kitchen large be and complete with all of the extras, and a living and sleeping area were also equally perfect. Can't say enough about Gail and Cindy's place, they have thought of everything you could possibly need and then some an outfitting their place and providing an ultra comfortable and very clean apartment. You'd have to search far and wide to find a better place to stay in a greater St Louis area. Most highly recommended!"

It is evident Gill and Cindy put a lot of thought and effort into creating a place that is comfortable and accommodates every need of a traveler. They have truly thought of everything you could possibly want or need for a short vacation or long term stay. They provided a binder with very thorough instructions, maps, and visitor information that was most helpful. Gill and Cindy are very friendly and take a genuine interest in you and your plans for the day. Their communication with us was excellent. The location was convenient to shopping and dining as well as area attractions. Should we ever return to Saint Louis, we would definitely want to stay here again."

The only thing I would suggest is using scent free cleaning and laundry products. Fabulosa has a very strong sweet smell. While some people may like it is a matter of taste and for some a health issue so many Airbnbs go with neutral scent products. For some people scents set off asthma. My partner struggled a bit. We kept the deck door open and did ok, but I just want to include this tiny bit of feedback here, just for you.🌺
Otherwise the place was perfect. Enjoyed our stay."

Location: The apartment’s location is unbeatable. Situated near Forest Park, it’s a stone’s throw away from the St. Louis Zoo, the Art Museum, and the Science Center. Whether you’re a nature enthusiast or a culture lover, this spot is perfect. Plus, the nearby Central West End and Delmar Loop neighborhoods offers trendy restaurants, cafes, and boutique shops.
Cleanliness : Upon arrival, I was impressed by the apartment’s cleanliness. The queen bed in the private bedroom was incredibly comfortable, ensuring a good night’s rest after exploring the city.
Amenities : The apartment is well-equipped. The fully stocked chef’s kitchen allowed me to prepare meals. Contains a dishwasher and washer/drier."

Stayed a few nights","During my stay, the apartment management switched over to a new security system, which rendered the coded and garage key originally provided obsolete. Anna was very helpful in navigating the logistics of the new security system to make sure I still had access to the garage. Anna was professional, responsive, and clear with directions.
The apartment is within walking distance of forest park and was amazing to be able to go to the different museums and landscapes without having to plan out parking.
The only issue was that due to the location of the apartment, there can be some sirens and honking cars, though it was not loud for long periods of time, just passing.
Also, finding the apartment can be difficult at night just due to the different streets and paths from the park or main roads. My advice is to try to get to the complex before sun down. The place obviously can still be found at night just a little more U turns if you have never been to the area."

This place was perfect for me and wish I could have stayed there for my three month stent in STL. The neighborhood was also right next to Forest Park so if you enjoy running or riding bikes you would definitely enjoy Anna’s place. Highly recommend

My only note is that if you are not driving and/or using the garage space, the key fob will open the main entrance doors if you push the grey button (that note may be more attributed to user error though).

Stayed one night","We purchased this night as a bridal shower gift for our daughter and her soon to be husband for their wedding night. It was late (after the reception) when they were traveling by taxi to the cabin, they were having a hard time locating the cabin. I hated to, but I reached out by phone to call Kristi, who was very friendly and helpful (even though I'm sure I woke her up). She stayed on the phone with me, while I relayed messages to my daughter and their driver until they reached the cabin. The next day, I heard nothing but rave reviews of how nice the cabin was."

We went here to celebrate my bf’s birthday. The instructions getting in to the property were clear. The description was on point. We also got to meet Kristi . Shes so kind and toured us around the place. She made us feel at home and so friendly.
The hot tub was amazing and was able to enjoy it while listening to the sound of nature. Never did we get bored as there were a lot of choices for entertainment, theres board games and the tv has netflix on it. And we also had an option to play volleyball or swim in the outdoor poo.
The place was also clean and has supplies for cooking and barbeque.
Overall,this is so far the best experience i had with airb n b. We will definitely comback"

The hot tub was perfect and I loved sitting on the deck to drink coffee in the morning and opening up the curtains to look out at the woods. I only wish I would have paid more attention to the listing and noticed that the pool was only open starting in June, lounging by the pool would have been the cherry on top. Im thinking I’ll have to come back next summer and try to bring my whole family because I think my brothers and all their kids would love it too!"

We were originally staying at a different Air BnB but decided to leave because it wasn’t very clean. Kristi’s place was a last minute find but from the moment we entered the property we were impressed. The property is secluded and gorgeous. Everything has a ton of character. The suite, wow it is just lovely. We were relieved to find that it was immaculate..like eat off the floor clean! What started as just wanting a place to lay our heads while visiting family/friends turned into the most peaceful vacation. The pups felt right at home and the hot tub was amazing. I like my hot tubs really hot and that seems to be hard to find now a days, this one can really get up there if you want it to. Kristi was the perfect host. IMO the cabin lacked nothing. We got the chance to meet her and she went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. We can’t wait to go back."

The honeymoon suite was very clean and looked exactly like the pics!!!! The bed/pillows are super soft and very comfortable!!! The cabin is very cozy, cute and perfect for two! It has a very romantic feel and makes you feel like your in the mountains!
We ate at two restaurants that Kristi recommended (Sorellis Italian Restaurant & the Russell House Restaurant) and both were delicious!!
Krsiti also recommended Don's Robinson State Park for a hike! We hiked on the blue trail and it took a little over an hour to complete but it was a great workout!
We will definitely be back to visit!!!! This will be our quick get-away from home now!
Kristi response time was superfast anytime we reached out! She is a great hostess!

Loved watching the wildlife outside the large windows. We didn’t see anyone there as we were there through the week which made the experience even better. The whole property looks like it could be a lot of fun when warmer weather arrives.
The only recommendation I’d make is to have a place to hang up coats and a place to put suitcases because we used the kitchen table mainly for that or the floor. Not a complaint and didn’t ruin the trip. Just a suggestion.
We appreciate the getaway from it all and hope to be back!"

Only thing I would change would be the addition of room darkening curtains and a curtain for the door windows. It would increase the comfort level of being in a remote place, and increase the privacy.
Other than that, we were very pleased with the cabin, the amenities, and the price."

Our only complaints were that there were no curtains on one of the windows facing another Airbnb on the property which made me uncomfortable. You also couldn’t park right outside the place and had to park a ways up. The bed was a little hard and the curtains didn’t stop any of the light which made us wake up very early.
That being said this little stay was peaceful the hot tub was very clean as was the whole house!! 5/5 on cleanliness."

Two easily accessible and private alleyway parking spaces. Close to plenty of things to do, and the hosts are very willing to give local recommendations. The house itself was the perfect size for two people to have plenty of space and had a lot of little amenities like makeup wipes, lotion, and granola bars that other airbnbs don't provide. The quality of the furniture, bedding, and overall decor of the house is miles above other places that I have stayed. Will definitely return."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I had a lovely two day stay at the garden cottage. The inside was nice and clean and looked just like the pictures.
The garden was wonderful but I feel like the pictures were a few years old. We really liked sitting on the deck drinking coffee both mornings and enjoying the view of the beautiful flowers along with the pond that had fish and a water fountain.
The brick walkway in the garden is pretty but it is a little uneven so be careful when walking in the garden if you have any mobility issues like myself.
We had a peaceful stay and no issues with neighbors. We didn’t hear any loud noises while we were there of any kind.
We had a nice stay and would definitely try to stay in the garden cottage again if we go back to St Louis."

I read in a past review they said something about not being lighting on the walkways, well there is lighting on the pathways now.

The home is very well-appointed, decorated, and had all kinds of thoughtful touches (tea/coffee, bug spray and blankets for the garden, sewing kit, spices/oil for cooking, etc). It truly felt like a home and not just a place to stay. The home was very clean and the bedding was luxurious and comfortable. Wifi was nice and strong, which made working from home a breeze.
The real winner, however, is the gorgeous garden! We spent hours in the garden. It’s shaded, lush, verdant and the sound from the fountain/koi pond is so relaxing. We enjoyed feeding the fish too! We will be using the garden as inspiration when we landscape our backyard. If/when we come back to STL, we definitely will be staying here again!"

Pansies on the table on the deck were a nice arrangement. We also loved the phonograph. We played The Commodores. The big green plant was spectacular! I thought it was fake at first. Loved the vintage touches and the wood hanging lamp in the living room. Tv stations were not to our liking. We tried to watch the Sacramento Kings vs. Warriors basketball playoffs but could not figure that out. Also baseball games. Netflix was ok but all the channels were not user friendly to us. I guess we are spoiled from our sports stations in Sacramento. All was great and attention to detail was thoughtful."

The neighborhood is safe, a lot to do for everyone in the family and also extremely quiet while you are inside.

The apartment itself is decorated well and the colors feel “quiet” as well. The furniture is comfortable and the bed is so lovely with linens that hug you to sleep! You will rest well in the quiet residential neighborhood near great places to explore.
The Japanese garden complete with carp in the pond, simply exquisite Sitting in the garden, even with the chill in the air, exceeded my expectations.
It will be a great joy to visit again in warmer weather to sit longer in the garden and enjoy even more of the beauty of this perfectly landscaped oasis. .
The decorating creativity has sparked ideas for my own home! Antique doorknobs for hanging items; brilliant!
An old record player, too! The best! Thank you Lisa & Dan!"

Even a fire pit with blankets during colder weather or a little outdoor seating to enjoy coffee in the morning. The indoor space had all the little touches that made it feel like luxury at home. A smaller, cozy space but they did such a great job with the details and decor; natural light window in the shower, gorgeous chandelier in the bedroom, a record player with diverse selection of vinyls and lots of cozy blankets, lighting, and even a shaker with martini glasses.

Stayed a few nights","This place exceeded my expectations! I liked being able to park off the street even though the street itself wasn't too busy. The garden was beautiful even in the winter, we enjoyed being able to use the firepit and listen to the sound of running water. The area was quiet overall so it was easy to relax during the experience. The house is small, as they say, but I think it was quite homey for two people, and it was the perfect size for me and my partner. The decorations were also well thought out, the furniture comfortable, and we quite liked the record player. We've never had a record player before but we enjoyed having it on in the background so much that we think we will get one ourselves in our own home. The bathroom would be the part you need to watch out for if you have a hard time with small places as it is a little cramped, but they do a good job of designing it in a way where it doesn't feel too bad. Overall, we were quite happy with it and will for sure be going back again"

Very easy codes on the doors to enter and exit! We were particularly pleased that there was an easy to find back ally parking (2 spots) area. There was also a code to get into the gated backyard. Everything was totally safe and secure. Very quiet neighborhood, which we appreciated!
The back yard was like a little fairy tale garden. The pictures displayed on their air bnb page, did not do “it” justice!
You’ll be a hop skip and a jump from some of the very finest restaurants in St. Louis.
Would we recommend this cottage again!? 1000 times over. Loved the darling Christmas decorations too!

Stayed one night","Charming and clean air BnB with lots of thoughtful touches.
My toddler and I stayed here for 2 separate nights as a half way point on a road trip to and from Kansas.
The kitchen is really well stocked. There wasn’t anything I needed that they didn’t have. The bathroom is small but very function I liked the shower hooks inside the shower. The water gets nice and hot.
The bedroom gets really dark when you close the curtains. The AC works great too.
The house is very quiet at night which was perfect for sharing a room with a toddler.
The keypad is nice instead of having to use keys to get in and out.
The courtyard garden is a gem and my little one could not get enough of it. The hosts left fish food with directions so we fed them each morning.
The space was perfect for our needs. The hosts were also very responsive.
I parked in the back at first then moved to the street parking out front both were easy.
Highly recommend this airbnb wish I could have stayed longer."

Stayed a few nights","Ashley's studio suite was just as depicted online. Open, airy and plenty of space for two people to spread out and relax. We walked to nearby restaurants, met the locals which was great fun and the Missouri Baking Company is a definite plus just half a block away - yumm!! Suite was super clean and all the amenities of home - the only downfall was the queen bed (if it was) had a foam mattress and for two older people was quite the trip to get out of bed in the morning - felt like we slept or rolled to the center of the mattress and it was an effort to roll out of the dip we had created - other people's feedback was the same on the bed. It needs a real mattress. We would definitely recommend this suite for its central location in the Hill."

The worst was the host did not respond. arrived at 930 and had trouble with lock. i called and did not receive a call back. Eventually went back and reviewed four or five different emails and did figure out that there was a delay once the code was put in. while it was included in instructions, it is a very small detail to recall.

Stayed a few nights","Our stay here was wonderful! The neighborhood was fantastic for food and just about everything we wanted to do—most of which was in or near incredible Forest Park. Our hosts provided a lovely space. The Italian decor in the very Italian neighborhood is a neat touch. The Italian food, bakeries, and gelato shops that are easily within walking distance were sublime.
If I were going to nitpick / advise fellow guests, I’d point out that the space is on a fairly heavily trafficked corner. So if you’re wanting quiet, this might not be the place for you. In addition, the space does not have a freezer, so you might plan on getting bottled water you can refrigerate instead of relying on ice.
All in all, I’d recommend this place to anyone and would certainly consider staying here again if we ever end up back in St. Louis!"

While we were there we saw the 50th annual soap box derby right outside our place. St. Louis offers many free activities and they are within a 10-15 minute drive. There are little restaurants and small grocers within walking distance. Parking was a breeze as long as you can parallel park. I hope you enjoy this place as much as we did.

I highly recommend Gioia’s and Cunetto House of Pasta to anyone who stays here and wants a tasty Italian meal. The place was also a short drive to other neighborhoods we wanted to explore - the grove and Morganford. The unit was clean and had a great ambiance. It was perfect for my boyfriend and I, but I could see it working for a group of 3 or 4 friends or a small family. Thanks so much for great trip to The Hill!"

However, the Hill is one of our favorite neighborhoods to explore and this place was in the heart of it and in east walking distance to our favorite deli, Giolas. It was nice to walk around and take in all the hill has to offer while also being a good home base for anything you may want to do in St. Louis. I’m already trying to think of excuses to go back. Great stay."

Stayed one night","My daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Ashley‘s house on the hill.
The house was pristine, clean, and really beautiful! We really loved what looked like the original tin punched ceilings, and the brick exterior. It had all the feel and look of a very well kept brick home with totally immaculate up keeping. We appreciated the nice big, fluffy white towels, cozy linens, and just the overall beauty of this place. The only thing I do wish is that they had a 11 o’clock check out which is very nice when you only have one short night in such a sweet place.
We Gioia’s Deli a few blocks away… We got a huge Gorgeous salad that was only eight dollars and a amazing sandwich “Big Italian” which was quite possibly one of the best sandwiches I’ve ever had in my life! They do make their own spicy salami 🤗❤️😋 turn
Thank you for all the wonderful hospitality. If we make it back to St. Louis, we will definitely want to say here yet again! Blessings💕

It is small and roomy at the same time, well for 2 people anyway.
Very comfortable bed and pillows. We just loved how the space of the place was set up to look like a home. The lighting is very nice; at night it doesn't get completely dark, as the street light comes in, but only with enough light for you to see your way around a new/different place, and not bright where you can't sleep.
The neighborhood is a nice quiet area, well at least in February. A lot of places to go for food, and not too far for anything else to do.
If we're ever in St. Louis again I will look to see if this place is available.
Thank you Ashley for being a very good Host and letting us stay in your beautiful place."

I stayed alone and felt completely safe. Had it been summertime I would have sat outside on the steps. The apt is on a cross street, so there is a great deal of traffic passing by, but after a while I didn't notice it as much.
The apt is very cozy. Everything I needed to prepare my meals was there. I like that I could have visitors as long as it wasn't a party and your company respected the neighbors, and property. I went to relax, and I did just that. I will be back during the summer to experience the neighborhood in full bloom.

Stayed a few nights","The place was hard to spot at night, we had to circle the block the first time we tried to find it because it was a 1 way street and we couldn't back up. It's the 3rd building on the right going south on Lawn Ave. We found street parking but didn't need it after the first night because there was parking behind the unit. You just have to go down the alley just west of Lawn Ave, Very convenient.
The unit itself was fine. Smaller than we expected but good enough. The bed and pillows were comfortable. The kitchen was clean and well stocked. The bathroom was fine except there wasn't much room to put toiletries and towels. There is a space heater built into the wall next to the tub which we didn't need but should come in handy when it gets colder.
One downside was that there wasn't cable or satellite service. It's a smart TV but it took a while to figure out how to navigate the apps. If you have a Roku device you might want to bring it along."

Stayed a few nights","I booked Adam's place to stay while I started my travel nursing assignment in St Louis. I am originally from Iowa and had planned to drive back and forth between stretches of shifts. After staying in Adam's place, I quickly realized I wanted this to be my place to stay for the duration of my contract. Adam was responsive and flexible, and allowed me to book his place for a longer term stay. The place was clean, it smelled extremely fresh, the air conditioner worked amazing and appliances were up to date. The bathroom is not very well lit but the rest of the apartment is, and you can absolutely move one of the portable lights (which happen to be VERY bright) into the bathroom if needed. The bed was comfy and soft. Parking was right behind the building and very convenient. Overall, I'd recommend Adam's place 100% and will definitely be staying here in the future after my contract if I am in the St Louis area!"

Stayed over a week","I had a wonderful stay at Adam’s listing. Adam is very responsive and helpful with any questions or possible issues. The listing was just as described, there were a few small cleaning issues when I arrived, but Adam was quick to respond and resolved the issues immediately! I was a long-term stay, and Adam frequently checked in to ensure I had a comfortable stay and had everything I needed. The only “issue” I had is that the neighbor on the side east side is particularly noisy and is a frequent marijuana smoker. I’d often hear or smell their activities, of course this is no reflection of Adam’s hospitality nor anything he could’ve changed or fixed. Wasn’t a huge deal for me, I just figured I’d add a quick note in case this might be a bigger issue for future renters! Again, nothing that Adam did wrong and overall I had a great stay!!!"

Otherwise, the location is prime, in a lovely neighborhood, and the bed was very comfy. Everything was clean and as advertised."

The city neighborhood is quiet and safe. If you are looking for a ""no-step"" entrance, just find the alley, and park behind the unit. You'll be surprised to find a brand-new cement parking area and new sidewalk leading to the apartment. I did enjoy eating breakfast on the front steps and watch the neighborhood wake up. This is a newly re-habbed unit, yet you will enjoy the old city charm with tree-lined streets. Comfortable bed? Absolutely! Wonderful shower pressure?"

The loft is expansive and tastefully decorated. The kitchen has all equipment necessary to easily prepare meals. The living space is open with lots of natural light. The bedroom is its own amazing retreat with a very comfortable bed and great linens! The entire loft was spotless. We appreciated the welcome basket of treats and the bottle of wine! The bakery wasn’t open to the public while we were there, but the smells were divine. Terry and Linda are extremely gracious hosts! We would absolutely stay here again and highly recommend Terry’s place to others!"

I’d recommend staying with Terry and Linda on your next visit to St. Louis."

Endless amenities that make you feel at home, like a full fridge / freezer, nice eating utensils and plates / bowls / cups. On street parking, but never an issue parking right at the door and the neighborhood was pretty quiet day / night. Very high shower head - tall guys who are used to staying in hotels with those 5'8"" shower heads know what I'm talking about. Very comfy king size bed with quality pillows. Very open floor plan with lots of sunlight and space. I reached out twice with questions and got very quick responses. Pro Tip - # is on the bottom left (this will make sense if you stay here.)"

Check-in was very simple. Terry is great at communicating and even making sure you arrived safety. Always there to answer any question and/or concerns. The pictures are very accurate. Food Network kitchen ware, there was nothing I even needed extra while cooking it really made me feel like home. My stay was initially 2weeks and I ALWAYS had parking. I will even extend the 3months of my Nursing Contract. Just minutes from the Arch, Downtown, and just feet away form the addictive smell of baked goods downstairs. This area is full of restaurants and shops that you can walk too. I always felt safe. Huge Bed with another TV packed with Netflix, Hulu etc. New appliances no broken door handles are the little things you might find. Like I mentioned super host for a reason."

Everything was spotless from the fridge, bed linens, to the bathroom area, etc. A much appreciated added touch was a binder left on the coffee table that included near by restaurants, bakery, and attractions with personalized reviews!
The hosts were kind enough to leave a few complimentary items that made our stay feel homey. We were excited to try the family owned bakery that is beneath the apartment. The owner of the bakery was very kind and friendly. The treats we chose were delicious and unique. We felt that the location was central to the activities we had planned and the parking right in front of the apartment was always open with spots, even on the weekend.

A short 10 minute drive to most St. Louis locations, this was a perfect base to explore from. Whisk (the sustainable bakery below the loft) has delicious treats and The Mud House one block east has fantastic breakfast. We will definitely be back..."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our two night stay at Terry's and Linda's very spacious, newly renovated, modern and sleek loft apartment. The owners spared no expense in the recent restoration of this beautiful and historic building located in the Cherokee row (antique district) of St. Louis just a walk, minutes or short drive to the best downtown attractions, restaurants, bars, music venues, sports, museums, Arch, riverfront, Forest Park, zoo Missouri Botanical Gardens and St. Louis University and Barnes hospitals. The apartment is extremely spacious (larger than the photos depict) and is equipped with everything you need for an enjoyable and restful stay. The fully-stocked kitchen boasts high-end, stainless steel appliances, ample soft close kitchen cabinetry, dishwasher, stove/oven, large refrigerator, coffee maker, deep sink, built in trash cans, large kitchen island with high top seating and microwave. The kitchen has everything you need to prepare snacks and meals. The living room area has a comfortable couch and chair with a large, flat-screen TV offering free premium cable and local channels. The separate, very large bedroom has a nice overhead fan, second flat screen TV, two large closets, desk, decorative fireplace and the most comfortable king-size bed of any air bnb we have stayed at and more comfortable than most very high-end hotels. The bed sheets, towels and duvet are of premium quality. The bathroom is modern and clean with a shower/tub combination and beautiful glass vessel sink. The apartment is tastefully and thoughtfully decorated with gorgeous wood floors, nice furniture, art work, photography and recessed lighting. The overall space makes for a luxury retreat. Also, in the unit, is plenty of information with tips and recommendations for exploring St. Louis. The complimentary bottle of wine, owners' handwritten note with their phone numbers and a gift certificate to ""Whisk,"" their daughter's bakery located on the ground floor, was very much appreciated. We really liked the privacy and quiet of being the only apartment in the building. The apartment is on the second floor that you access via multiple stairs (no elevator), so those with mobility issues may need to consider a different option. Free street parking, directly in front of the apartment, was also very convenient. The owners were great to communicate with and we definitely will return to this apartment again. The large, outdoor patio area currently is under construction and we look forward to seeing it upon completion. This air bnb is a great value!"

Stayed a few nights","This place is truly a gem! The amenities are endless in this house with everything you need to host a 4 course meal and all the information you need to never have to cook at all! It is cozy, comfy and secure and the neighborhood is quaint and historic. Terry and Linda leave ENDLESS and i mean endless recommendations on what to do and where to go on your stay with details into the environments and food you are thinking about diving into. Also, the mattress. Its heaven. Best sleep I have ever had! TRULY. I cannot rave enough about this hidden gem. GO!"

Stayed a few nights","Whenever we were expecting, This space and these hosts exceeded. Easy of entry and communication, but also the space was so much larger then it appeared in photos, the artwork was wonderful and at times it smelled of baked goods because its in proximity of a local bakery!I studied here the night before and of my wedding and it was ideal in everyway. They left us a card and a bottle of champagne as congratulations. We look forward to staying again just for the sake of it. Exceptional."

All of the special touches were great, from the welcome snacks and wine, to the Whisk gift certificate, to the welcome handbook that came in handy when deciding on places to go. The neighborhood was gorgeous and quaint. We loved it so much and will definitely stay here again!"

Stayed one night","Terry and Linda’s place is phenomenal. Spacious and beautifully remodeled, this apartment has many large windows and is decorated with perfectly curated art and antiques without being fussy. We thoroughly enjoyed the king size bed that was firm with a plush topper/pillow top and nice thick sheets. The kitchen has everything you need to prepare a meal, and they left snacks, wine, and a gift certificate for their daughter’s bakery downstairs. Check in was a breeze with street parking right by the door and two keys (we didn’t need two this time, but often travel with our teen children and wish we had two keys.) There is a very thorough house manual with suggestions for restaurants, bars and other things to do. There are plenty of restaurants nearby and a grocery store down the street. Terry and Linda are consummate hosts who have thought of everything; robes, special washcloth for your face, printer, family games, umbrellas...You will love staying here."

Stayed a few nights","Terry and Linda are consummate hosts. Information regarding check-in was sent to me in a very timely manner. When I contacted them the day before our arrival with questions, they promptly responded and made sure I had all of the information I needed. Their instructions for check-in and check-out are detailed and clear. Their guidebook, which includes helpful information regarding things from managing the remote control to offering suggestions about local dining options and things to do in St. Louis, was very helpful. They really have thought of everything a traveler might need and want in an AirBnB. They were extremely hospitable--with wine, coffee, water, and snacks in the apartment. The apartment itself was immaculate and is beautiful. They have done a fabulous restoration of the building and it is warm, very clean, well-furnished, and full of natural light. The kitchen is lovely. While we adore many restaurants in St. Louis, we are already planning to stay in and cook on future visits. Their love of St. Louis is apparent with many items highlighting the history of the city tucked away on bookshelves. It's a really nice touch when so many places feel sterile and dull. They have thought carefully about all of the details that would make a guest feel comfortable. Bedding and towels were pristine and high quality. It was, by far, our best AirBnB experience. We travel to St. Louis several times a year and have no plans to stay anywhere else. One final note, the power went out on the block for a couple of hours during our stay. I contacted Linda about it and she very promptly checked with the power company and was able to give us an estimate as to when the power would be restored. She helped us to plan accordingly and went above and beyond to make sure that we were informed and updated. I cannot recommend this apartment, and Terry and Linda, highly enough."

Stayed a few nights","First of all, this is a lovely, lovely apartment. Very clean and stylishly decorated. As other reviewers have noted, it is much larger than it appears in the photos. The kitchen island is massive and the kitchen is well equipped with everything you need if you wish to cook on vacation (I don't :) ).
We enjoyed the large TV and we appreciated the music channels available.
It was brutishly hot during our stay and we were delighted to find an industrial table top fan that enhanced the air movement in the large space. Of course, the space is air conditioned as well.
We always had a parking space directly by our door and the security was primo and we felt very safe and at home in the neighborhood.
A work of caution if you are ""older"" travelers. My husband is very tall and we really enjoy the high ceilings in a property like this. However this necessitates that a very steep set of stairs leads to the upper level. We were aware of this, and we found the hand rail to be secure and reassuring, so we were not bothered. But some folks may find the steep climb with luggage a bit daunting. Also, for the senior travelers....As I said this is a large property and the bathroom is at the opposite end of the apartment from the bathroom. It's quite a hike through the living room and kitchen to the facilities, so if you are one to get up several times during the night, this may not be the place for you. We're both in our early 60s, and not yet impacted by such considerations...for now."

There were several things however that were not up to par and that’s why I didn’t give it a full 5 stars.
-Could not get bathroom TV to work
-Cleaning in the theatre chairs need more attention
-Huge ceiling leak that we could tell has been going on for some time hence the water stain stretching the whole length of the ceiling
-Could not get surround sound on walls to work
-Sub to soundbar for TV was not already working…we had to mess with it for about 15 minutes before we looked up the instruction manual. Makes a huge difference when watching movie/music.
-Didn’t see checkout instructions on the listing but right before we left we found a folder with a few tidying up recommendations and we followed them.
Recommend adding them to listing."

Will definitely come back and suggest to anyone that asks about a nice place to stay for the weekend!"

We did a last minute date night in town and Steve made sure we had everything we needed including to-go coffee cups for our early morning departure! Not to mention we absolutely loved getting some puppy love from his pups! (He asked us if we were okay with it before hand and we are dog people so it was wonderful!) The TV was huge with theater seats! Very clean! Stocked fridge and coffee station! Exactly what we needed. We will definitely come back!

This is a great location for scooting downtown or hitting any of the 3 major highways (2 accessible within less than a half mile). Parking out front was plentiful and well-lit. The adult beverage stocked fridge was much appreciated and has many local options to enjoy. The bed is super comfy with multiple firmness pillows to choose from. I was so happy this was my home base for a few days, and I look forward to coming back in the future!"

This Airbnb is perfect for long or short stays or if you're looking for a place to watch a high profile event with a few friends as the space offers amazing lounge chairs and a HUGE TV. I'll most likely pick this place again if it's available next time I have to be in St.Louis and I'm grateful to have been a client!"

We arrived late at night but were able to easily navigate the detailed instructions provided and gain access to the place without issue. While it is located behind the main house, the pathway to get there is secure and well illuminated. My only negative is that the bed offered is actually a Murphy bed and was not very comfortable for two people. It reminded me of a pull out sofa without much support. I ended up sleeping in the recliner chair in the photo (which was comfortable but just not what I had planned to do)."

The fridge is stock with water and plenty of great beer choices 😃 They also give 2 beer per person, with no extra charge!! The tv inside is really nice and comes with all the great streaming services like Netflix to HBO! Wonderful stay for the night, we couldn’t recommend more of this great place to stay and relax at!"

Stayed one night",My boyfriend and I used this bnb as a rest stop during a 33 hour road trip. We ended up getting there at like 6am. I truly do appreciate how nice and accommodating Steve and his wife were for us. We were able to be fully rested for the last leg of our trip. Thank you so much. And the place was spectacular!

Stayed one night",We had a great time at Garage Majal! The pics are exactly what you can expect and what we were hoping for. Steve was responsive when we had a question. Location is close to several breweries and Uber is easy to get. We’d stay again if in St Louis.

Stayed a few nights",We enjoyed ourselves it was very cozy and perfect for the occasion. I loved it I wish it was warmer so we could have enjoyed our goodies from the dispensary but was way to cold to smoke outside lol 😂. It was affordable and perfect. We travel from Alabama so we had a great experience.
