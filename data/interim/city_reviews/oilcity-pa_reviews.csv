Stayed a few nights","We had such a wonderful stay here. The pictures don’t do it justice. Such a relaxing and pleasant atmosphere in the house and garden. There is even a swing chair in the kitchen! I especially loved the master bedroom. Super comfy bed and linens, and the room was just so relaxing.
We felt treated with all the cereals, snacks and cooking supplies provided.
Hosts were quick to respond and kind. I could really go on about everything. The block it’s on is lovely and walkable. A few blocks away is a little rough looking but we only found that out by walking around the town. If we ever come by this was again, I would stay here."

Group trip","This place is beautiful! Staying in an old Victorian house is a great experience, and Oil City is full of some massive homes as a result of the area’s wealth generated by the early oil and gas industry. A great escape for the weekend or a week - very close to the Allegheny River Trails as well."

Host was responsive and helpful. The house is beautifully cared-for. It is historic- and furnished as such. Because it is historic - know that outlets are not always “convenient”."

Kitchen stocked with essentials which made cooking meals easy so we did not have to eat out. Very nice coffee bar. Large dining table was a great space for meals and games. Living area with clean, comfortable seating. Large bedrooms and everyone commented on comfortable beds. 2 large bathrooms with plenty of towels. I was worried about the location being close to a main road but this was not an issue at all, very little traffic noise. Large back yard with an apple tree, which was a favorite spot for deer. House conveniently located to Oil City and Cranberry. Communication from host very clear. Highly recommend this home to anyone visiting the area. I hope to stay here again next year."

Stayed with kids","We had such a great stay. The house is even bigger than I expected, and was truly perfect for our family gathering! Absolutely everything we needed was there and easy to find. Extra chairs and high chair in the cabinet. Every pot, pan, and utensil needed to cook a big meal. We were 2 adults and 4 kids ranging in age from 2-15 and we could all spread out and find something to do, whether relaxing in the very comfortable living room, coloring in the office, or throwing a football in the *huge* backyard. There were 6 of us, but if you were a larger group you could also be very comfortable! The setup is excellent and very spacious for meals, sleeping, etc.
Ryan was a great host- easy to find the place, easy to get in, very communicative. Thanks so much for a great stay!"

Stayed with kids","The house was a great place to stay just a little outside Oil City. My wife and I had our small kids there, as well as several other relatives. It wasn't clear in the description, but there's a nice breezeway as you enter the house, which made a nice staging area for coats, bags, etc.
The house was nicely decorated, but without much that we needed to worry about the kids breaking. One of the bedrooms with a large bed had a convenient closet where we set up the provided pack & play and left the door cracked for a little one to sleep.
Ryan was communicative and obliging as well. Overall, it was one of the best places for us to stay as a family while spending time with other relatives in the region (both at their houses and at Ryan's place)."

The first evening we arrived in was sunny and warm, and the last day we were there, it was snowing! We got to witness Springtime at its finest! Thank you so much for this memorable getaway. We were escaping from East Palestine, Ohio and the Norfolk Southern train derailment clean up-which is very close to our home.
We hope we can stay here again in the future, under much better circumstances!
Thank you again for everything.

Stayed with kids","Immediately fell in love with the view of the river! From the kitchen to the dining room to two of the three upstairs bedrooms, the view is amazing! My wife and I talked about taking another trip over warmer months and working remote so we could enjoy the river during downtime.
Convenient to everywhere. Very clean and cozy. Left wanting to buy the place. 😂❤️
We’ll definitely be repeat guests.
Only downside (and this is probably my fault for not researching a little better) is that I thought we truly had the whole home to ourselves (per the description).
Discovered the home was split into two separate rental units upon arrival. We rented the larger upper unit (3 bed, 1 bath), but there’s another unit on the ground/basement level of the house.
We have a daughter who has some pretty intense ‘stranger danger’ at times and she was uncomfortable the last night when a new group checked into the lower unit. She (we) were so worn out from hiking all day that we crashed pretty quickly."

Stayed one night","This upper unit is basically a 3 bedroom house. Bed was comfy, bathroom is good size with tub/shower, cozy tv room on the first floor, large kitchen with everything you could want. It is right on the river, I enjoyed watching the water and hearing the birds. Peaceful neighborhood. Hosts are very helpful and accommodating. Everything very clean. The stairway to the second floor might be a little steep for older people, but stairs are carpeted. The house is right next to the boat launch, and place where you can rent kayaks. Great location!"

Great Internet connections and access to Prime.
Riverfront is beautiful in any season, we so enjoyed walking along river front. We loved the private parking and walking area immediately beyond the house. Summer time would afford great campfire activity.
Kitchen dining bistro table easily seated five for meals and games, with another three seats available at end of the kitchen bar. We cooked meals in the well stocked kitchen that included every cookware piece you will need.
Excellent time at this Airbnb. Well done!"

The beds are extremely comfortable and the house was immaculate when we arrived.

Stayed with a pet","We stayed and Nellie and Thomas's Allegheny River Retreat from 5 to 9 September and very much enjoyed our stay. The house is spacious and nicely furnished with 3 bedrooms and a bath upstairs, and living, dining and kitchen on ground level, washer/dryer in the basement. Attention to detail in quality of furnishings, coffee and tea provided, dishes and silverware, and appliances were at a level above what we've experienced thus far in our Airbnb experiences. During our stay, Nellie and Thomas were quick to answer questions about various things like trash pick-up and checkout checklists, when I messaged them. Before arriving, we were worried about parking on the street, but after arrival we found that parking was not an issue as the house is situated on a quiet end of the street. We came to ride our bikes on the many trails in the area - - it was well worth the trip. This area has one of the best networks of bicyling trails in the country. We look forward to making this same trip in the autumn of next year and hope Allegheny River Retreat will be available for our stay."

It is also close to a cute town with lots of good restaurant options. Nellie and Thomas are super responsive and accommodating. The house has everything you would need and the location is amazing, views of the Allegheny River and Mountains. If you plan to kayak use the recommendation to plan OARS to pick you up down stream, the current can be tough to paddle back upstream to the house. I absolutely recommend this place to anyone who wants to relax in nature and still have WIFI and a SMART TV!"

Stayed one night","The best way I can describe this is that it's like a very pleasant clean, simple, basic, furnished studio apartment, with bed, desk, chairs, and kitchen in one open-plan space, with a separate bath consisting of toilet, sink and shower. Pros: Directions and check-in were a breeze, the bed and pillows were comfortable, the kitchen had everything I needed and more-- including full size refrigerator, stove and sink--and the bath was clean, neat and fully functional. It felt like a stay in a tree house, located above another dwelling on the beautiful grounds of a Catholic retreat center conveniently located very near the Van terminus of the Sandy Creek Trail--one of the premier rails-to-trails in Western Pennsylvania. Cons: water processing system is noisy after flushing, as is the frig. The skylight above the bed leaked a bit of cold air. The thermostat was hard to program. Otherwise, a great stay in a great place at a great price! I'd happily book again."

Stayed a few nights","Heron's Landing is a beautiful little apartment that the owner has decorated to make your stay so very relaxing and was remarkably clean. And if you are an old vinyl fan, she even has a good collection of older albums you can play on the turntable. It's easy walking to downtown and the southside of town. Lots of mom-and-pop restaurants and little shops nearby. This is a 2nd floor walkup one flight of stairs. Not a problem for me, but something to keep in mind is you find it hard to walk up steps. Erin also owns the Woods & River Coffee shop you will be staying above. Being that I don't drink coffee, I've never been in a coffee shop, not even a Starbucks. I did have a Cappaccino and told her it was the best one I've had since living in Italy years ago. Make sure you try the Beartown Breakfast Sandwich and homemade muffins. They are out of this world good. Great place to stay being that I haven't been back to Oil City since 1996 and would stay here again. I love my old hometown."

Stayed one night","Erin was a wonderful host, very responsive and helpful. The place smelled delicious as soon as you open the door (if you like coffee). Super comfy couch in the office. The shower head is a force to be reckoned with, water was hot, but we found the tub drained slower than it filled, so it was a quick shower.
There are designated parking spots, a beautiful library across the street, and the coffee shop downstairs has really yummy breakfast. Their bagels and cream cheese were a fav. and the Blackberry Mocha is the best I've ever had.
If we find ourselves back in Oil City, we'll be booking Erin's place again."

We loved the easy check in/out and the fact that we were able to cook our own dinner instead of having to find somewhere to go. We also enjoyed relaxing and watching tv on the loveseat instead of a hotel bed. Having our own beds was also nice because we are both bed hogs. Will highly recommend to everyone that travels this way!
Also, LOVED the tea we got in the morning. We will be stopping there again for our drinks!"

Fresh ground coffee was provided, and there were some other beverages in the fridge, that was nice! If you are a light sleeper, this might not be the place for you, as I was woken up every morning around 6:30 am by the sounds of the coffeehouse below. We had some of their lattes, and they were definitely delicious! I shopped around for Airbnb's in the area, and this one was the best value.

Stayed one night","My stay was wonderful. The apartment delivered on what it advertised. I was surprised at how beautiful the view of the river was from the bathroom. It was just as gorgeous as the photo. I had some family over to play Scrabble after our get together & was happy to find a nice little selection of LPs on the shelf to spin on the turntable. The bedroom was clean, quiet, as dark as I wanted it to be, with a space heater in the closet if I needed. There were extra blankets & pillows w/2 options of fill sizes. In the morning I could just barely hear the coffee shop starting to open but I was getting up anyway. I don't think it would have awoken me if I hadn't already set my alarm. Even though there was a bag of ground coffee in the kitchen I went into the shop where I met Erin & rec'd my complimentary latte. I must rave about Woods & River! I had them grind & fill a bag to take home, it is that good. The egg Sammy on buttermilk English muffin was divine. Highly recommend! Thanks Erin!"

The cabin looked just like the pictures and was just as cozy and beautiful as we had hoped. The location felt very safe, and we really enjoyed seeing the wildlife.
Some of our favorite things were drinking coffee and eating meals out on the deck, reading on the swing, relaxing by the fireplace, walking the trails, shopping at the Grove City Outlets, cooking meals together in the well stocked kitchen, doing puzzles, and playing games.
If we ever need a place to stay in the Franklin area, we would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","Pioneer Rock Cabin was lovely and set in a private, peaceful location. We enjoyed our two night stay. It had all the amenities anyone could want. Especially appreciated was the well stocked kitchen items, spices (fresh), coffee, sugar and many other staple and food items, either provided by owner or left by other guests. Everything was fresh and recent; not always what we've found at other rentals we've stayed at. Well supplied kitchen utensils, cookware, dishes, etc. Everything was spotless. Great instructions everywhere on how to use ac/heat, tv, etc. The many decks and seating areas outside were nice; unfortunately the weather wasn't great but we were able to enjoy one day mostly rain free and sunny outside on the decks. Saw deer and other small wildlife. The business area of Franklin was interesting with some nice businesses, candy store, antique stores, restaurants and more. A great retreat to relax and unwind."

Stayed with kids","I really want to keep this a secret so we can have it to ourselves but ... Pioneer Rock cabin is a total dream! The property is exactly what the pictures show, but better - it was way more spacious than we anticipated, both inside and out. The cabin was so cozy, immaculately clean, and clutter free, yet had all the necessary items to make cooking and relaxing a breeze (lots of puzzles and games and tons of blankets). The kids had fun exploring the woods around the house, which is at the top of a very long driveway. The area is very quiet and secluded, yet just 10 minutes from the very quaint town of Franklin. We enjoyed checking out the local bookstore and coffee shop, and had lunch one day at Linda Lou's which was delicious and affordable."

Stayed a few nights","The cabin is very cute and we appreciated that it was filled with antiques. It's clear a lot of love went into curating the space. The kitchen was well appointed and the grill was great! Know that there is no bathroom in the basement where 2/3 bedrooms are located and there is very little sound privacy. If you are staying in the upper bedroom overlooking the living room, make sure you are not a light sleeper.
The little town of Franklin is very cute and if you go you must try Bella Cucina! There is a tree in the middle of the restaurant and the ambiance is great. We also did the OARs kayaking experience which was a lot of fun. We did feel that the price was a bit high given the area, but still really enjoyed our stay."

Stayed with kids","""Wow, I may never leave"" were the first words my wife said when she walked into the kitchen. Don't worry, we did in fact leave so now you can rent the cabin and enjoy it as much as we did. The cabin has a really cool layout and the style inside is beautiful. We had a 6 and 2 year old and we felt perfectly comfortable with them playing around the house (our two year old managed the spiral stair case really well). We found supplies we forgot and all of the amenities were easy to find or clearly labeled. It sits on top of a hill and during the winter we could barely see the neighbors houses between the bare trees. There are plenty of games and puzzles. We've stayed at a lot of places and this is an absolute stand out. We really hope to make it back."

The moment Stephanie found out we hit a “bump in the road” she apologized and made sure our stay was even more “top tier”. I’m not sure who decorated her house but it is BEAUTIFUL guys!

Great antique shops and a welcoming community (everyone polite as we strolled). Check out the Debence Antique Music World museum! Small cost for a trip back in time. Call ahead and they will happily schedule a tour guide for you as soon as possible. My 12 and six year olds were very entertained while our informative guide taught us all about the collection. We even had privilege of playing some of the instruments and listening to many more! Great trip and we only covered 1/2 the agenda. Well, it is a very cozy cabin 😄"

Stayed over a week","The Kaneville Lodge is amazing - a hidden gem in a safe, beautiful area of PA. The lodge itself is deceptively large, with all of the amenities you will need. When you walk out the back door, you see nothing but nature, including a creek, the mountains, and the changing colors at the finest. But with these refreshing feeling of nature, there are enough stores close by that it is by no means isolated or difficult to resupply. Beyond this, the host is extremely kind, amiable and quick to help if you so need. I strongly recommend staying at the Kaneville Lodge anytime of the year."

If I work in the area again this will be my first choice for a place to stay.

Plenty of room to park with the boat still hooked up and the space provided everything we needed for a night away from home. Not one complaint from us.

Stayed a few nights","This place would be perfectly fine if you’re just traveling through and need a place to crash. But I was there for a weekend to getaway from home and I found myself with not much to do in the surrounding towns or much of choices to eat for someone looking healthier especially since most things were closed on Sunday which was my full day there. Since it happened to heavily rain and even hail that day too I didn’t get to check out the oil creek state park with my dog like I’d wanted so I found a park (McConnell’s mill) right on the way home that I went to the day I left instead and it was beautiful there at least to make up for it. I didn’t quite find the place cozy enough to enjoy having to spend my whole day there due to the garage/cement flooring that goes across all the rooms and the noticeable signs of things that hadn’t been cleaned completely since the last person was there - yellow spots on back of toilet seat, tiny facial hairs from shaving on the counter and shower, crumbs/food residue on the utensil holder in the kitchen and coffee table spaces as well as the edges of the floors. However I was able to cook a full meal in the kitchen for dinner which was relaxing and very nice that they had a full oven/stove and cookware."

We loved that it was within walking distance to all the shops and restaurants in downtown Franklin. Sarah was so easy to communicate with and was always very responsive. The kitchen was so well stocked with anything you could need. We especially liked to gather in the large living room up on the 3rd floor, with so many spaces to sit and a big table to play games or do a puzzle. The small kitchenette on the 3rd floor was perfect too. We liked the little den on the 2nd floor too, with the 2 big chairs, the comfy bean bag chair -the record player and record selection, was a cool addition. We loved all the art work on the walls. I will say this is one of the most nicely decorated AirB&B's I have stayed in. We hope to come back again. (Prior to your arrival you will receive a link to a guide book about the house which was so helpful)."

The host accommodated our last minute booking and the place was clean and fully stocked with everything we needed for our stay. Easy and clear instructions for our stay and the inside was really comfortable.
I think it's worth mentioning that the staircase to the 2nd floor is pretty steep and narrow. This was not an issue for us at all but it might be helpful to know if you're traveling with kids or anyone with any mobility issues. There is a nice bedroom on the 1st floor that makes for a good accommodation to that.
We loved our quick trip. The sky was cloudy but bright to the north and the location was perfect for viewing :) We'll definitely be back at the next big solar storm. Thank you!"

Stayed with kids","We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Ryan's cottage. We felt right at home and enjoyed walking around the pond, looking at all the wildlife, and strolling down the corn field. Ryan was very communicative and an overall super hosts!! We had everything we needed for our stay at the property. He worked with me on a few items for my toddler son and it was hugely appreciated. The road outside the property is busy and the stairs are steep (as stated) but this would not deter us from staying here again. I'd highly recommend booking any property hosted by Ryan. Thanks again!!"

The cottage was super easy to check-in to and all the rooms were very cozy and well-decorated. I absolutely loved waking up in the morning and drinking my coffee out on the front porch.
One thing to note is the stairs going upstairs are steep and narrow. Someone with bad knees or older in age could have a difficult time going up/down."

Stayed about a week","We've stayed at Ryan's place twice now. This beautiful place always has hidden historical suprises. The locals told me that the house was built in the 1800's and that it was saved and renovated because it was a stop on the underground railroad....it's pretty amazing to stay in a place of great significance!.....the foundation is made from huge cut stones that have much historical value. Also always the kitchen is stocked with good coffee, great spices, quality snacks, and the best selection of oatmeal that I've seen anywhere that I've stayed. If you like scenic nature type views this place is perfect. The sunset over the pond, cornfields, and trees is amazing and the stars and moon reflect on the pond and look stunning. Anyhow, Ryan's place is awesome to say the least and it is my first choice to stay when I am in the area."

Stayed a few nights","Ryans place is soooooo much better than the pictures. The best qualities about this property are the lake and front porch. If you take time to walk down to the lake you will see hundreds of bullfrogs. If you take time to sit there and just hang out you will see a wonderful sunset. The porch is great because it's brand new and there's plenty of seating and also a brand new grill. Which leads me to the kitchen, Ryan's place has a gas stove. It is loaded with multiple spices and tons of snacks that you will definitely forget to bring. Ryan makes sure that the snacks are there and you need not worry about that part of your trip. Ryan is extremely easy to deal with and always replies within minutes. In closing, I would like to say that this place is one of my top five places I've ever stayed in. Farm Life and pond life are awesome."

Also, the thoughtful inclusion of a playpen and baby gate were super helpful for our 18 month old. The only thing I might recommend is adding an AC unit in the downstairs bedroom. Beautiful rural location but only minutes from ample shopping (came in handy since I forgot my running shoes). Really a great place to stay and would definitely recommend!"

We loved the decor from the shutters to the shelves and beyond! The included amenities, from an abundance of towels, etc to morning oatmeal and snack bars, were greatly appreciated. Although it only has one bathroom, it's generously sized and nicely updated. We appreciated the night lights in rooms and the fans. The baby gate is a nice touch as well, considering this is a typical old farmhouse with really steep and narrow stairs. The bedrooms upstairs have shorter ceilings and a slanted floor, but that wouldn't stop us from staying here again as it was priced right, private and overall really cozy! Thank you for a great stay as we were passing through!"

Ryan was wonderful to work with. We had to move dates around due to a power outage in the area and he kept me informed and worked with us. We stayed here for a couple of weeks, the weather went from 30° to 80°, Ryan came over and put the grill out and offered to get the AC installed to make sure we were comfortable.
The amenities met what is shown on the listing.
We feel like there were different bed options, which is nice.
-the 2 big beds are memory foam
-the 2 twin beds are conventional mattresses, one firm and one more soft. There were also many pillow options, also.
We will definitely stay here again!"

Group trip","I honestly wish I could give this listing a 20 star review. I cannot possibly recommend this location, or these hosts enough.
It was the most darling, beautiful cottage, with a breathtaking view. No light pollution, so you can see every star in the night sky, and a huge porch that overlooks the field and the pond. Furthermore, we stayed in June when the frogs were singing, and the fireflies were dancing, which was absolutely magical.
The inside is completely updated, yet they preserved the historic details of the house to keep the original charm. It also had every amenity one could need for their stay; air conditioning, comfortable beds, a full bathroom, and a full kitchen with new appliances. They covered every detail.
Communication with the host was very prompt, and accommodating. Every request we made was met with kindness and understanding. They really made our stay special!
Thank you so much!!

Stayed over a week","This is a return stay, so that in itself speaks to my satisfaction.
As a newly established listing on airBnB, there were some minor overlooked amenities. After mentioning to Ryan, they were addressed, most on the same day.
I’m staying here for business, so my needs are different from weekend visitors. Looking from a recreational perspective, this place is quiet, has a fire ring and plenty space for relaxing and enjoying the environment. I can’t say enough about the birds singing in the morning and the frogs singing from the pond in the evening.
There is always a breeze, so even on hot days, opening windows on both sides cools the place enough that AC isn’t necessary, though I use it when rainy.
It is a few miles from the Allegheny River in one direction and Oil Creek in another and state game lands in a third. While not immediate access to any of these locations, none are far.
Having identified how pleased I am with Ryan, I am going to make a brief reference to AirBnB’s support for abortion, noting my displeasure with the company’s policy."

Stayed a few nights","Ryan's cottage was spectacular. It has a well-stocked kitchen that we have not had at other places. He provided coffee, tea, breakfast items, and ingredients our daughter used to bake delicious chocolate chip cookies. The entire cottage was spotless from top to bottom and newly remodeled.
Ryan was a fantastic host and communicated thoroughly throughout the stay.
The only negative aspect of the cottage is its proximity to a two-lane road that fast-moving vehicles travel on. If you have little ones, you will have to monitor them closely, and the road noise is distracting if you decide to sit on the porch and converse.
Despite those issues, we will reserve this cottage in the future."

I have a recurring job at the local UPMC that necessitates a two week stay every month for a while. This is ideal location for that job site, only about 3 miles away. The area is quiet - well, except for the serenading birds in the morning and frogs in the evening - couldn’t ask for a better musical chorus.
I’ll be staying here more, so plenty of opportunities for more detailed review.
If you also have similar situation with UPMC and the dates I’ve reserved don’t quite jive with yours, perhaps we can work something out. Let medical affairs know and maybe we can make an arrangement for any overlap."

Stayed one night","Windy Hill Cottage is truly lovely. It is decorated with clever and talented care to make it truly appealing to guests but is, at the same time comfortable and homey. The kitchen is designed brilliantly to fit all that we needed and the bedrooms were roomy enough to allow easy moving around and plenty of space for belongings. Online and tv reception and options were excellent and Ryan quickly and completely answered all inquiries while we were there. His recommendation for Bella Cucina in Franklin was spot on and we had delicious meals there.
And the view from the front porch is spectacular. The cottage sits up on a rise and provides beautiful views from all angles. On advice from Ryan we made sure to catch the sunset and it was amazing. We will be back and will be recommending Windy Hill to others for sure."

This is a historic house with so much character, it has beautiful hardwood floors, and this special place was immaculate. For dinners we suggest traveling over to trendy Franklin for some Italian cuisine and be sure to check out their local brewery. Also, you can pick up some great food to go at Stiller Meats and Smoke House. Thank you so much for a wonderful stay!"

The home was clean and had everything you needed. Definitely recommend
Edit: I had to immediately come back and make an edit on my review. My boyfriend and I accidentally forgot our wading boots at Katrina's place.

Franklin is a very Beautiful place to visit and the people are very friendly. Downtown area is a good place to start. We did window shopping the first night . Pizza & Stromboli the Fox Den is a must ! We went to see the Youth Theater ( it was great) right Downtown for both.
If you like wings, you will absolutely Love the Purple Goose !!

The house offers 3 bedrooms upstairs and an additional sleeper sofa downstairs, this provided all 5 of us their own bed.
We totally overpacked because Katrina provided everything needed for a great stay, hairdryer, high quality shampoo, Kerrig coffee maker and capsules, snacks and water. Think 4*Hotel with lovely amenities.
Communication was excellent and Katrina even offered early check-in, which we didn’t need, but appreciated.
The house is located on a quiet residential street, safe neighborhood and right overlooking the river.
We all slept extremely well and can’t wait to return in warmer weather to make use of the outdoor space."

Stayed during a really cold snap and were warm and cozy. Walk to cute shops and good restaurants. Perfect table space for dining as well as playing family games and everyone had their own space. Unfortunately it was too cold to make use of the lovely back deck overlooking the river. We will have to return in warmer weather! Highly recommend.

We are very picky about where we book, and I have to say that Katrina's beautiful home ALWAYS is above and beyond what I am hoping for. Wonderful and beautiful location right on the creek, exceptionally clean, decorated beautifully, walking distance to pretty much everything in town. The hosts are truly lovely people who I feel like I've known for many many many years. Don't hesitate--book this absolute gem!!!"

Stayed a few nights","1st time using AIRBNB and was EXCELLENT!! Katrina is the PERFECT hostess! I had SO many questions after renting and before we got there and she was SO quick to respond and extremely friendly, I could just tell it was going to be a GREAT experience. She checked in with us once we got there to make sure we got in house fine and to make sure we had everything we needed. Franklin was an Adorable town. She provided booklets of things to see and stay in area. Her home is SPOTLESS, comfortable, modernized and decorated so nice. I must say as far as the town of FRANKLIN my friends and I enjoyed the food and GREAT friendly service at Trails to Ales restaurant. Great food, service and Beer. Our other favorite little stop was at the GRUMPY GOAT Distillery. Great home made batches of liquor. Loved the Peanut Butter Licker, Peach Shinewine and the Lemoncello. Great service and samples. Of course a couple bottles came back to Ohio with us. It was a WONDERFUL girls getaway!!! Thanks Katrina!!"

Stayed with kids","From the moment you pull into the driveway, it’s obvious that Katrina has put a lot of love into this place. It is beautifully furnished & decorated & SUPER clean! I loved the combination of modern updates & old architecture. It is extremely well-stocked with anything you could possibly need & then some. She truly has thought of everything! Board games, Wi-Fi, smart TVs & streaming services are a great bonus! The beds & pillows are very comfy. Our favorite part was the deck overlooking French Creek. Even though the house is situated between 2 other houses, fencing on the deck makes it feel very cozy & private. Check-in was seamless with the electronic lock. Communication was great. I felt the price was very reasonable, compared to other homes in the area that offered way less for the money. I could go on & on. I just can’t say enough good things about this home & host. We have definitely found our spot when visiting family in Franklin again. Thank you for hosting us Katrina!"

Very clean and spacious, it offered more than enough space for our family of three and still plenty of room for two other family members that came for two of our six night stay. The house provided stylish decor, awesome porches for happy hour, a big family room for movie watching and a well equipped kitchen for doing meals at home (although I recommend the delicious, walkable restaurants in downtown Franklin). We truly relaxed and enjoyed our vacation thanks to the wonderful accommodations. Highly recommend! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

We enjoyed walking around Franklin...such a sweet and walkable town and neighborhood. Loved seeing the parade and hope to go to play at the quaint community theater some day. If staying in the area, we couldn't recommend highly enough. Wildcat Mansion and Event is 2 miles away where we went to a wedding. We very much enjoyed our stay here and welcome a return."

The house has been decorated with a lot of attention to detail and it is very spacious and comfortable, with the added luxury of a ground floor powder room. Everything was clean and we found all we needed to prepare meals. The bed we slept in was comfortable and it was very quiet at night. The stairs to the bedrooms are quite steep. This is an old house, so to be expected, but might be a bit of a challenge for those with any mobility concerns. Also, the host/cleaners use a lot of air freshener. If strong scents bother, you this home won’t work for you. This is a really nice home in the historic city of Franklin. We wish we’d had more time to explore the town which had some terrific architecture. Thanks, Katrina, for being a responsive and welcoming host."

We were in town visiting our family over Christmas and Katrina went out of her way to put up a Christmas tree and very beautiful holiday decorations that it really made us feel like we were home. I unexpectedly was voted to cook Christmas dinner for our family of 10 (yay me!!!) and she made sure I had everything I needed to prepare dinner. She even sent me photos of all cookware and appliances to reassure me there was no need to bring anything with me.
I can’t thank her enough for the exceptional hospitality she showed during our stay. Christmas time is hectic for everyone, but she never skipped a beat… if I had a question, she was right on it to accommodate us!
Oh, by the way, go to Bella Cucina for lunch or dinner (she runs this charming restaurant), you will not be disappointed! Best meal I’ve ever had in Franklin, and I grew up here!"

My mother has mobility issues, so I can tell you the stairs up to the second level are steep and tough for anyone in that position, but there was a pull-out couch and bathroom on the main level, so it was not a problem. I would recommend and stay again!"

Also the bed was extremely comfortable which was heaven sent after a long day on the road! Franklin seems like a sweet town as well I wish we could have explored! Host was kind and communicative and it was neat reading her story about the home!

Stayed a few nights","Beyond 5 stars!
Katrina is a top tier hostess who has thought of everything. Her place was immaculately clean, comfortable and in a great location. The beds are super comfy and the linens were soft and fresh. The bathroom has a huge stack of fresh towels and salon quality hair and shower products. The water pressure was great and the shower was piping hot. The kitchen was well equipped with everything you would need to cook a feast and the dining room has room to serve a crowd. The family room furniture is comfy and there’s lots of room to hang out and watch football or movies. The house is located on a quiet road and the deck overlooks a large creek so the view is great.
This was, by far, our best AB&B experience to date. It was like staying at a friend’s house. We truly appreciated her attention to the details that take an experience from “fine” to “outstanding”….and Katrina nailed it."

The bed was honestly so comfy and cozy I didn't want to leave. The history behind this location is amazing and it was very humbling to be so close to such an important river. I am already trying to figure out when I can go back! Katrina was super nice, too! 💞💞💞"

At check in she said she had a boarder adjacent to the room and will be washing clothes; the banging lasted til 10 pm from behind the headboard, defeating purpose of staying in Timbuktu. Roads were muddied after the rains, and place hard to find. Carpet, dusty, not good for anyone with allergies. Tv was hard to operate. Sleeps 5 for $79.00 after fees and taxes, cheap if you are willing to take a chance with your health."

The room and it’s bathroom were spotless and nicely decorated. Kathy was incredibly responsive and helpful with directions getting to her home, as we were arriving after dark. She, Jerry, and Major (the dog) even met us upon arrival (at our request- we wanted to say hello and thank her for having us).

Group trip","This was the perfect place to stay, right in the middle of our journey from Kentucky to Rhode Island. They were able to accommodate all six of us comfortably in the room, the only Airbnb that I could find that could do so in one room. Four of us were teenagers and they were excited about the chocolates, hot chocolate, board games but most of all the animals: horses, chickens and the super friendly dog and cat. They also had a wii, a pool and a fire pit. Town is not far with cute shops. There is a McDonald’s 9 minutes away that is open late. I just loved waking up and making fresh coffee in the Keurig and then going and sitting on the back porch in the beautiful morning and looking over the lovely pond, listening to the the birds and frogs and petting the cat. The hosts were wonderful and friendly and I enjoyed talking to them. They even gave us fresh lettuce from their garden!"

Stayed with kids","I had come up to visit my son (3 years old) for a few days. The hosts were very helpful with everything, the only trouble I had was staying connected to people that didn’t have an iPhone (AT&T doesn’t get service here). No fault to the hosts, it is what it is. The wifi worked pretty good that I could still email clients, it just had trouble with streaming shows on Netflix. Regardless, it’s still well worth it for the price they are charging. It’s quiet, it’s peaceful and nostalgic if you grew up on a farm. Their dog Major was such a loving, friendly pup, he did get a little hyper with my son but that’s on me as well, I just didn’t realize my son would be skittish toward a dog Majors size, since he’s been around big dogs all the time before. The dog was just trying to be friendly, loving and playful so he was NEVER aggressive. I would come back again if AT&T had better service and there was a full kitchen (which I knew there wasn’t, just realizing my needs). All in all I still loved it"

You do need to follow them, as the GPS can take you in the wrong direction, which would be very confusing at night. The surrounding area is pretty dark. The paths are clearly marked with reflective tape. The property was secure, and we were able to conveniently enter without any issues. We met the hosts when leaving, not at arrival because of our own schedule. The space was very large, with plenty of place to sleep and lounge. We had lots of towels, toiletries, and many small considerations that made us feel welcome. We were also so surprised to see the horses. My son (4) was so excited to see animals. The environment is very tranquil, and we enjoyed the views. We hope to be back!"

The main room is large with several beds, a sofa, table, and chairs; the big bed has the best mattress (imho). Bath was fine. The best things about the place: the personal warm welcome Kathy's husband gave me, the personal and thoughtful care for guests with which the place is maintained, and the lovely quiet woods. Real country dark and real rural peace. Helpful notes and tourist info provided. An easy drive to Franklin or to Titusville."

Just a few minutes drive from Oil City and the City of Franklin. Talk about Main Street America! It’s a sweet little town, like something out of a hallmark movie. Cranberry is the next town over if you need to do any shopping.

This place is awesome, and I am already telling my friends I want to come back here for an actual vacation stay. Lots of beds, blankets, board games, candy, well stocked bathrooms, and an AC! Also, a pool and seemingly amazing grassy area outside. Also, I met a CUTE cat who showed us lots of love.

When my GPS said that I had arrived to my destination, I was in the middle of nowhere with two horses in the field. So I opened my ipad and read the instructions how to get to the house and in 5 minutes I was in front of the house. I opened my ipad again and looked at the airbnb picture and the same picture was in front of me. Following the same instructions, it was easy to find the key and get to the room. The room was spacious and clean, has everything you need: bathroom, refrigerator, coffee machine and a board with answrers to all the questions you may have. I am a city girl, but I really enjoyed quitness and peacefulness of that place. Thank you very much."

Beautiful house on the bank of a lovely river -- if it's good enough for the eagles, herons, ducks, geese, turkeys, deer, turtles and the rest of the wildlife, it's good enough for us. The verandah is great for sitting morning, noon and evening, and there are hammocks and chairs all over the grounds for rest and ease.

The paddle board lessons taught by Mr.John was a memory my husband will forever cherish. Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner was so enjoyable out on the porch, no rainy days except one but that didn’t get in our way of enjoying our vacation. The way Mr.John and Mrs.Darlene cared for us as if we were apart of their family, was incredible just as we see them as one of us. To top it off, the boat ride Mr.John and Mrs.Darlene offered us was a cherry on top! We are definitely coming back! Thank you. Sincerely, The Serrano Family."

The owners thought of everything possible, from spices for cooking, access to kayaks, to firewood to purchase on site. John and Darlene were helpful with suggestions for activities to attend in the area. We took advantage of the large comfortable porch, with playing games, making crafts, eating on the large table next to the large propane grill. Definitely a 5/5 or a 10/10 or 100/100 whatever number you use this Cabin is an A+. We enjoyed a fabulous long holidy weekend from the minute we arrived on Friday till we left on Monday."

Nothing cheap or flimsy here. Very generously provisioned with supplies. The kitchen is equipped for serious cooking, if you're up for it. (Not much in the way of restaurants in the area, so we ate most of our meals at the cabin.) Our party ranged in age from 8 months to 75 years, and everyone happily enjoyed the venue in different ways. The covered porch overlooking the river was so comfortable and inviting.

Everyday you will see deer, geese, ducks, otters, amongst other wildlife. The cottage is recent construction and has all the modern conveniences and is spotlessly clean. Bedrooms are large with very comfortable beds. A big kitchen with an island is a perfect breakfast spot, while the large front porch facing the river is a fantastic lunch and dinner venue. We grilled every day on the huge gas grill in between trips down to the river dock for fishing and swimming. Down by the river, the fire pit is huge and the Adirondack chairs and picnic tables make a great place for family gatherings. I've already booked to come back in October!"

Stayed with a pet","We stayed at this cabin over Easter weekend, and it was perfect. While the weather wasn’t the best, we were still able to enjoy walking along the river, relaxing on the covered porch, and keeping warm by the fire pit. The house was spotless and the beds were comfortable. Also located close to Oil City and Franklin to take advantage of their restaurants and coffee shops. Can’t wait to return when the weather is warmer."

Stayed with a pet","Lovely cabin, with a beautiful view-- if you love nature and wildlife, this is the spot for you! John and Darlene are great hosts, very close if you need something, but not bothersome. Beds are comfy, kitchen is stocked with all the essentials & appliances, and the front porch is right out of a magazine. The cabin is clean, spacious and has a great layout. Fishing on the Allegheny is an added bonus. We will be back when warmer weather comes to PA!"

Stayed a few nights","Many thanks to John and Darlene! This was the first time my wife and I ever stayed at a property through AirBnB. This was a great experience. We visited Oil City and the Oil Creek State Park. Although it rained throughout most of our stay we were able to get out and hike many of the area trails, check out waterfalls, and then come back to relax at such a nice home. 4 wheel drive will come in handy when visiting some of the obscure trails and would be a ""must have"" when there is snow and ice. We now have relatives that want to book this home. Thank you John and Darlene."

Stayed a few nights","Beautiful and secluded location. We wanted a peaceful place to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary and we found exactly that. From sitting on the porch in the rain to watching the ducks and listening to the sounds of nature, everything was perfect. John and Darlene provide a clean and beautiful place with everything you could possibly need for cooking."

Group trip","John and Darlene were exceptional hosts. Their place was lovely, clean, bright, and welcoming. We had everything we needed - all the comforts of home, everything we needed to cook and serve a meal. There was a nice array of spices as well, and everything we needed to make a pot of drip brew coffee (we did bring our own coffee abs filters just in case though). The only thing we found missing in the kitchen was a wine bottle (corkscrew) opener. However there is a liquor store right in town in Oil City, so we picked one up there. The location right on the river was wonderful and mostly private. You can’t see any other homes except for John and Darlene who live about 50 or so yards away next door. Because they’re so close they checked on us once we got settled in to make sure we had everything we needed. They also left a little note with tips on the kitchen counter as well. Don’t forget to sign their guest book!
They also offer daily kayak rentals including life jackets and firewood can be purchased on site (at a premium for the convenience, compared to purchasing a cord yourself). The fire pit is quite large and there are Adirondack chairs for 5 or 6. The only downside about the fire pit is that it’s hard to get quite close enough to make mountain pies and s’mores because of the large rocks that make up the outer “ring”. We managed though and it worked out just fine. Small children will need a little extra help.
The beds and couch were comfy, and there were enough linens and blankets for everyone. Internet was decent but you’re in the woods so shut it off anyhow!
We were able to swim from the shore and play in the water with the little one. We also tied a few floaties off the dock and spent some time floating and relaxing in place. Lots of eagle sightings and an owl, too.
The only other thing I would like to mention, and it’s at no fault of the hosts, is the water has a slight odor. I believe it may be because this is well water? I’m not certain, but there was a definite odor to the water. We ended up going into town and buying several large 3 gallon jugs of water for drinking, cooking, and brushing our teeth. I’m sure it’s safe to drink, it was just unpleasant. Again, no fault of John - you’ll have that in the country sometimes. No big deal.
All in all it was a wonderful stay and we definitely plan to return. I’ve already told a few friends about the place because we enjoyed it so much!"

Stayed with kids","We had a great stay ! The hospitality was excellent and absolutely everything was considered , truly felt like home away from home. The location is exactly what we wanted , very peaceful and surrounded by the beauty of nature. Also the communication was great and very personable, we had a question and the owners were quick to reply. If we are ever planning a trip out that way in the future we would love to book a stay here again.
Thank you again !"

Stayed a few nights","Rain or shine we had a fantastic time. John and Darlene were extremely enjoyable to talk to as well as accommodating. The porch was perfect, during the rain we lounged watching the river and it’s big enough to have movies on our projector at night. We floated in tubes anchored to the dock most of the trip and saw an abundance of wildlife throughout the stay. It was really close to perfect."

Stayed a few nights","This spacious cabin is in a peaceful and enchanting setting along the river. It is well-maintained and has good quality furnishings. The kitchen is well-stocked with cooking pots, pans, and utensils, (and has a nice variety of spices). We found the bedding in the second floor master to be very comfortable. We spent hours enjoying the fresh air on the wide porch, which has sitting and eating areas, complete with new grill. The basement and dock areas are used by the owners; they lived in the cabin for several years, before building the house next door. They could not have been nicer. A perfect place to enjoy the comforts of home and the great outdoors! You will not be disappointed."
