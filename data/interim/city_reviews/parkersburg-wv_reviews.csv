Stayed with a pet","Donna and Mike’s place is was exactly what we needed after driving all day. The view from the back porch was relaxing as we listened to the fire Mike had started for us. We saw deer and rabbits as the sun was setting. The cabin had everything we needed and the bed was very comfortable. When we travel back to NY, we will definitely try to stay again."

Stayed one night","Donna met me as I arrived. She and Mike are so friendly, you can tell they enjoy hosting. Extra bonuses include the lovely farm animals, the beautiful view, and the peaceful setting. The cottage itself is so well made--by hand with gorgeous natural wood--and so well decorated. Probably Donna has thought of all the little amenities--homemade cookies in the refrigerator, for example. I couldn't have felt more welcome and taken care of."

View from the deck was like a picture. The cabin was charming and well decorated. Ducks, chickens, and goats add to the unique personality of the place. Early morning outdoor fire by Mike is extra special and his and Donna’s warmth and hospitality are beyond wonderful!"

Stayed a few nights","Donna & Mike are excellent hosts! The cabin was sooo squeaky clean and smelled fresh. It's feels like you're in the middle of BFE (wonderful!), but you're so close to so much. We explored a few restaurants in Belpre but found Parkersburg to be most interesting. We found Filipino & Lebanese restaurants that were delicious. The Parkersburg Brewing Co. has tasty food and a wonderful selection of beers. We visited The Parkersburg Art Center, where they were displaying, for the first time ever, a collection of some of Billy Foster's work. You're probably not familiar with his art, but it's worth doing a little research.
Overall, we throughly enjoyed our visit and will be coming back again to visit Donna & Mike!"

Stayed one night","Donna and Mike greeted me on arrival and gave me the quick tour of the space. I ran to town for a quick bite and then came back to relax and watch a movie. The tiny cabin was very cozy with an electric fireplace that was great for the cold evening I stayed there. The bed was super comfortable as well. I couldn't believe all the additional space in the loft, so there is plenty of room if you have kids traveling with you. If the weather has been warmer I would have liked to hang outside on the deck, the area was private and relaxing."

Cozy cabin is the perfect name for this place because it really is so cozy. We loved it so much we decided to stay a second night. Mike even built us a beautiful campfire. They made us feel right at home but we still had our privacy. So much wildlife around and the view from their property is lovely. We loved their sweet little goats! Well worth the value, would love to come back again in the future."

Stayed a few nights","This sweet gem is tucked away in the rolling hills and peaceful meadows of Ohio’s beautiful countryside. It’s a just-perfect cozy cabin complete with an awesome fire-pit! You’re going to see deer grazing in the meadow in the evenings and hear bluebirds in the morning while drinking your coffee on the beautiful deck outside your door. Mike & Donna are kind & friendly and have thought of everything. They are there if needed—yet with the perfect balance of giving you privacy as well.
Your accommodations are extremely clean ( super important to me) & honestly—you wont want to leave.
Restaurants, tourist attractions, & vintage shops are amazing & nearby- but (thankfully in my opinion) not walkable. However, evenings by the moonlight with s’mores and/or wine, and comfy chairs are right outside your door.
It’s one of those places that you know you will come back to. We were super happy & felt like we made new friends. It will be our go- to place when visiting beautiful Marietta."

Stayed with kids",Cozy Cabin is a perfect name for this hillside retreat. Our 2 year old loved roaming the land and seeing the 🐐 and 🐔 🐥. You can tell upon arrival that Donna has been in hospitality for so long! She gave a great introduction to what was available and how to reach her with questions. Mike's attention to detail when building the cabin is also noted in how great the space is utilized. My hubby and I were so glad this was our choice for our 10 year wedding anniversary. The town also offers beautiful river views and parks. We used the local libraries wifi to download Bluey episodes since the cabin was without. In our spare time the games provided kept us entertained and the conversation flowing. Overall our time went by to quickly and we look forward to going back in the future.

It’s in a very nice rural setting yet close enough to access restaurants, fuel and other necessities if so desired. Check in with Donna was a breeze as she personally went over the details of the cabin and things nearby.
The cabin itself was custom built by Mike for the grandchildren and it shows in the details — very nice! (Works well for full-size folks, too. I’m 6’-2”.)"

The view out the window is lovely, the hosts are generous in what they offer as options (use of grill, etc.), and we enjoyed the personal touches in the interior decor. Snacks (cookies, granola bars, etc.) and coffee/tea/water are provided; microwave, toaster oven, refrigerator and coffee maker in the room. The listing photos provide an accurate description. We had no trouble finding it at dusk (almost dark); heading out from the center of Belpre, look for the house number on the mailbox post. Recommended; we would stay there again if in the area.

The cabin is handy dandy for anything you prefer to do “inside” otherwise it’s heavenly for the multitude of “outside living” ie: fire, deck, grilling, bird watching, wildlife spotting- you get the idea!
We call it heavenly!!
Mike & Donna did not disappoint either! Great people with a tank of hospitality! Wish we could’ve stayed longer!"

The house is tucked away in the foothills of Belpre, OH, but is not difficult to find. Once we arrived, Donna and her husband were right there to assist with check-in. Throughout the stay they provided everything we could possibly need, including local recommendations. The unit itself was spotless and exceptionally comfortable, and stocked with everything we might need.
We just can't say enough of how peaceful the AirBnB was, nor how helpful and accommodating our hosts were. If we're in the area again, we'll probably look for this listing first. Amazing value and a great experience!"

Stayed one night","We were only in town for the night, to see my Mom for Mother’s Day. I wish we could have stayed longer!! Mike & Donna were exceptional hosts, they met with us upon check in, and walked us through everything. They even made delicious fresh homemade cookies for us! They also built the cabin themselves, and it was beautifully crafted with wonderful attention to detail. Would 10 out of 10 recommend anyone to stay here while visiting Little Hocking, Belpre, Marietta or Parkersburg/Vienna. Away from it all but a short and beautiful drive to any of these locations. It truly is a complete peaceful sanctuary to rest, and take in the beauty of its surroundings, while still being close to everything the MOV has to offer."

Stayed with a pet","Great place to stay! The cabin kept us warm and dry from the the cold and stormy nights that hit us. My young sons had fun and loved the cabin, but they were too young for us to comfortably allow them upstairs. There wasn’t a gate or a guard upstairs to protect toddlers from possibly falling down the ladder. The hubby and I slept upstairs and it offered us some much needed privacy. All of the beds were comfortable, but the best part was Donna and her husband. They were welcoming, friendly, and great to chat with. Donna always answered her phone promptly when I would ask about something or make a request. I would love to stay again next year!"

The view from the deck outside the cabin was fantastic. And the location was an easy drive to the surrounding towns, just the right distance away from town to feel like you have some space, but not so far away to feel isolated. Overall, just a great stay.

Stayed in a few Airbnb, usually kitchens are light on utensils and pots. Crystals place is fully stocked to cook for a big group and even got a gift basket to make some S’mores! Awesome location, just a couple hours away from Columbus. Will definitely book again!"

It was spacious and very comfortable . There were extra towels and wash cloths, plenty of supplies (toilet paper, shampoo, etc.). Everything listed on the page for this unit was accurate. Tyler communicated well and responded quickly. For about the same price as one room at the hotel near here the week before, we got an entire apartment and it was much cleaner here. It was our first experience with an Airbnb and honestly, we will probably never stay at a hotel ever again."

Pay attention to the fact that it is indeed a 2 story town house. if you can't do stairs, this would not work. However, it is VERY friendly to a family or friends who are traveling.

Everything smelled freshly cleaned and laundered. The kitchen is beautiful. I have a daughter with life-threatening food allergies, so finding a place that I can safely make her meals while away from home is paramount! There are adequate plates, cups, bowls and silverware. I purchased cookie sheet and baking dishes, but otherwise most things are available.
Bedrooms were both beautiful and SO COMFORTABLE! No expense was spared on the beds; we slept very well!
The deck is a major bonus. Beautiful view of the Ohio River. Local park nearby was a fun surprise!
Location was quiet, peaceful and near everything one would need while offering a secluded feel.
We visit the area 6+ times a year and will definitely stay here again. 10/10"

Stayed one night","We loved spending the night at Byron's house. The living room furniture was so comfortable and was easy to relax in after a long day on the road!
The bed was comfortable, and the sheets were nice and cool, just the way we like them!
We still had a long drive ahead of us, but we couldn't resist sitting on the deck to drink our morning coffee. We felt quite at home, and very comfortable there."

Stayed a few nights","This is our second visit to Byron's place. It is clean, comfortable, quiet, safe, and within easy distance to stores, shops, and restaurants. At the house, there are plenty of amenities and a strong internet connection. You can get to Parkersburg or even drive to Marietta, Ohio within 10 to 15 minutes. We were very pleased with the price.
We were in the area for my 50-year Parkersburg High School class reunion and needed to rest between events. Byron has the most comfortable beds. We slept well!
You do need to climb seventeen steps to get to the living area, but we had no problem. We actually like that the house sits up high because it offers a great view of the Ohio River. We sat on the deck and watched barges go by while enjoying our morning coffee. We recommend bringing a set of binoculars.
Thanks, Byron! We hope to stay at your place on our next visit."

You enter the lower floor which is unfinished and go up the stairs to get to the living area but we didn’t spend anytime downstairs except to get in and out of the residence. Besides that, a nice stay close to the river!"

The TV channels were more than adequate. Condiments and many basics have been left or stocked. Location was in a quiet neighborhood away from main roads, but close enough to not be inconvenient. Nice water pressure and premium TP in the bathroom. We stayed one night and visited Blennerhasset island and museum the next day. Worked out perfectly for our expectations."

Stayed a few nights","Byron’s home was perfect for us. We received a code access and a key, which made entering and exiting super convenient. The house was just as the pictures online showed. Very spacious and clean. We were doubly excited to see they had coffee pods for the coffee maker, for us to enjoy in the morning.
The beds were amazing. We slept so well. They were the perfect firm/softness. Probably the best sleep we have had in months. If we didn’t have somewhere to be I would’ve definitely stayed in bed longer. 😊
The housekeeping staff showed up just as we checked out and as we got situated, she ran down with an item we had left on the dresser. We were so impressed that they looked around the house before cleaning and was able to return it to us before we left. It was a prize we won at a raffle and completely forgot we laid it down.
We will definitely return when we head back to the area. Thank you so much for the great hospitality!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a great value, and it is near the river with views on two sides of the deck. The place is a little dark, however there is adequate lighting. The kitchen is great, everything you might need. The flooring in the main area is bamboo and the kitchen and bathroom are ceramic tile, very attractive. Unfortunately, previous guests have spilled and stained the carpeting in the bedroom. Not terrible, but not nice. For the rate charged, this is well worth it."

Stayed one night","We planned a small trip to Blennerhassett island, and wanted to find an Airbnb that was close that had a view...We were excited to find this gem! Check in was very easy. We headed up the stairs to find a very clean house with everything that we would need. The best part of the whole house was the second story deck. It was so nice to sit outside, drink coffee and enjoy the rain while we stayed dry. We saw a tree frog on the deck, and watched the boats on the river. The bed was extremely comfortable....so much that I wanted to figure out a way to take it home with me (lol)...
This was by far the most reasonably priced Airbnb that I have ever stayed at, and it quickly became one of my faves."

Stayed a few nights","Parkersburg, WV is our hometown.
My husband and I traveled from NC and my sister and her husband came from Michigan to attend another sister's wedding in Belpre. We don't get together often, so Byron's place was a great central point and convenient for the wedding.
It was clean, easy to access, and close to restaurants and grocery stores. Some of our local family came over for dinner so we used the grill. We sat on the deck and enjoyed food and conversation. We took a long walk around the neighborhood and across the bridge to Point Park on the WV side of the river.
The house was exactly as described, except for the pictures of the view from the deck. It is much more scenic! There is a great sofa for napping and the kitchen is well-designed for cooking and serving.
If you need to stay in the Parkersburg/Belpre area, consider Byron's place. We really enjoyed it and think you will, too."

Stayed a few nights","Over the last 8 years we have stayed in hotels while visiting family in the Belpre/ Marietta area 4 to 6 times a year. What a wonderful surprise when a friend told us about Byron’s place, I honestly can’t say enough about how much we love it.
To begin with, it feels very safe. It’s a wonderful neighborhood where people walk their dogs and say hello as they pass by. The deck on the second floor is a great place to sit and have your coffee and read the paper as you watch the boats go up and down the river. This place has everything you need and most of what you would want. The beds are so comfortable and the bedding is first class. The “ rain shower” feels like heaven!!!
The kitchen has everything you need to cook whatever you want with top of the line appliances. The grocery store is less then 2 miles away and you have several fast food/ restaurants very close also.
One very important thing for me is cleanliness. I’ve stayed here 3 times and each time I have found it spotless.
If you have to leave your home,,,,this is the place to stay."

The rental was as described and very clean. Comfortable beds. Would stay again! Nicer and larger than a hotel and likely less expensive."

Stayed one night","We traveled from DC to Belpre for a friends engagement party happening in Parkersburg, WV and this was a perfect location.
You enter the house through the basement and unfortunately the light had been out when we arrived, but Byron gave us a heads up so we knew what to expect. Once we got inside and went upstairs through the basement, the house was stunning and so clean! I think it’s even nicer than the pictures listed.
There was a tv with cable, kurig with k cups and a few tea bags, half and half in the fridge.
Byron himself made the stay all the better! So responsive and helpful. A 10/10 human being and host. I would 10000% stay here again and I recommend it.
*Pro-tip there is a donut shop not far from the house called Mchappy’s and I definitely recommend a stop by!"

Stayed one night","Great location that is well represented in the photos and generally clean. This is a good place to stay for a small group of people if you're in the area. However, I'm giving a lower rating based purely on the lack of communication from the host which I'll go into detail below.
I initially received no communication from the host, not when I initially booked the location nor leading up to the check in day. There was also no information given on how to check in beyond the listing itself or any general follow up before the trip approached.
So the day before the trip I sent another check-in message in the AM to see if things were okay. There was no response for the entire day so I had to reach out via calling the host. This was the only communication I had with the host, which was less than 24 hours before travelling from out of state to the airbnb.
Ultimately, check in was fine but it was stressful to not know if I was even going to be able to check in and not having any communication prior to me independently needing to call to figure things out."

Stayed a few nights","We were surprised with the overall cleanliness of the rental. Anything you could need from Keurig Coffee Refills to Shampoo, Conditioner, Lotion. Washer & Dryer was very convenient, and plenty of room in the home. It's in a nice area, with nice homes, yet the homes aren't right on top of you...so you feel you have space. I'm a Travel Nurse that's worked lots of ER & Psych units, so I understand how important logistics and feeling safe are. For the price you cannot beat it.👍 We came up to cater a wedding with food prep, flower design & wedding equipment,... the whole deal. There was ample space for our cargo trailer.
All around, one of the BETTER places we've Ever stayed!
In addition, the owner happened to be near, and he is just as Awesome. A place you for sure would stay each time you visited the area... 💯%"

Yes, it's 36 steps up to the entrance, but the stairs are practically brand-new and well-lit - no problem! The kitchen and bath are well-stocked with snacks, water, juice and toiletries. There is a coffee station in the cute reading nook. The unit is in a fully-restored home in the historic district -- quiet and so walkable -- close to downtown destinations. It is an attic apartment, so tall folks need to be mindful of multiple ceiling heights, and the shower stall is tiny. Would definitely stay here again!"

The key was in the lock box (code was provided a couple of hours before check-in) right where she said it would be. The apartment interior was expertly decorated. She had all sorts of books for all types of interests. The space was kept cool with a beautiful wall mounted AC unit in the bedroom, as well as an oscillating tower fan in the living room. There was a wonderful little coffee/reading nook right by the window where quite a few coffee choices were available as well as green tea (k-pod coffee maker). A large screen TV was located in the living room and there were so many channel choices. We only stayed one night so I'm a little sad we didn't get to use the gas range in the kitchen, but it was a beautiful set up.
Tersia has gone above and beyond our expectations! We would definitely love to visit again! ♥️"

What I especially liked was how well-stocked the kitchen was with pans, cooking utensils, spices, and oil."

Stayed a few nights","Judy is a communicative and fantastic host who cares about her guests and gives them their privacy as well. Her airbnb is close to West Virginia and downtown Marietta. The neighbors dog gets on your nerves after a while. But, obviously, this is not an issue on the hosts end. Therefore, it doesn’t affect my review. I would recommend staying here and know I will when in the area again."

It was neat and tidy. The set up was very functional. And its close proximity to all the towns activities without the noise and bustle was a bonus. Thank you Judy for being an excellent hostess. I'm sure you will see us on future visits."

Stayed one night","We appreciated how quiet and private Judy's apartment was. We had no issues with check-in or finding the place. My husband enjoyed the Keurig coffee that was there, and Judy included a helpful information sheet on backing out of her driveway (it's a little curvy and on a hill!). The bed was too soft for our liking, but that is definitely a matter of personal taste! Unfortunately, the apartment was just not as clean as we expected it to be with the ""sparkling clean"" ratings and reviews. There was dust in a number of visible places, smudges on the mirror, some dirt on some of the walls...probably nothing a good spring cleaning wouldn't help with! Overall, we had a pleasant overnight stay, and I hate to leave a less-than-5 star review. But I would have liked to have known to anticipate a less-than-sparkling-clean place as I looked at reviews before booking."

Stayed one night","Judy's place is great. The apt is as nice, and maybe even nicer, than the pix. It's a short drive to downtown Marietta and to a cool Covered Bridges route. I could see it being a great place to stay for a few days to explore the area.
I had asked beforhand if the driveway was large enough for me to turn around since I was pulling a trailer with my car. It turns out the driveway is one way on a hill, and I wouldn't have booked the place if I knew this. Judy was great about helping me leave -first trying to guide me down and then, when that failed, calling her son to lend a hand. She was such a great hostess to go above and beyond like that.
I highly recommend this place."

The kitchen was stocked with everything, even ice and the cold packs to use in your cooler, coffee, creamer, snacks, water, and so much more. The living room had a very comfy
couch, tv, with DVDs, cable, all you would need to keep you occupied.
The bed was super comfy, slept great. There is a utility room, with an iron & ironing board, and plenty of space to hang your clothes if more long term. The bathroom is wonderful, and well stocked, even a blow dryer, and scales.
There's also a small table with 2 chairs to eat at, in an open concept floor plan. It was super clean, and nicely decorated. It's a little out of town, but just a short drive. I saw more of Marietta than I ever have, being off the main drag. There's no steps to worry about, good even for the elderly. The shower is elderly friendly.
I'd love to stay there anytime I'm in Marietta. A great find."

Stayed one night","This is one of the best airbnbs we’ve stayed at and we stayed at many. It is a warm and inviting space. The brown tones and squared off but open space design, plus the arrangement and ease of everything made us feel right at home. A balance of helping us feel grounded and a feeling of space around us after traveling for awhile. Slept so well! Spacious enough to do yoga in the morning. My only regret is that we didn’t have a reason to be there more than one night. It was so cozy. I can see all the thought and love that Judy put in to the creation of this space herself. It kind of reminded me of the IKEA showrooms—I always wondered what it would be like to stay in one of those spaces. For us, it was a bit difficult to find the entrance to driveway at night. Hopefully, that may change. We enjoyed wandering Marietta; and she is 5 minutes away from a very significant Earthworks Mounds. If ever we travel through there again, we will definitely keep RoadRunner’s Haven in mind! And we will let others know! The name suits it well."

Stayed one night",Our first stay in a Tiny Home. Very clean and well stocked with items used. Due to our age (over 60) the ladder to the loft bed was a little difficult for us to use in the middle of the night. Not at all the host's fault. We just weren't aware of the limitations an older couple would have with a tiny home. All necessary items were well stocked and fans and heater unit were very easy to operate. Wi-fi worked great along with the smart TV. Really appreciated the coffee and cream that were available. For a Tiny Home it offered everything we needed. I do believe though that younger more agile couple would not have any issues with the ladder and the loft bed access. I believe our flexible days may be over. LOL

The place was spotless when I arrived. The little kitchenette has everything you'll need. The loft bed was extremely comfortable and the TV area was very cozy. The fire pit and swing were a peaceful amenity to wind down at the end of the day.

Stayed a few nights",My dream is to live in a tiny house so I booked a little get away for myself. I work remotely and the Internet/space was more than adequate. I was able to take my little dogs!! They aren’t used to being “in town” so the neighbors getting in and out of their car at all hours set them off. But otherwise it was PERFECT. The host was amazing. I was able to Doordash food and cook and just relax. The towels and bedding were soft and smelled great! Everything I needed was right there. The place was clean. I will return again. :)

(This is not related to the house if you have pets be sure to have your ticks treatment up to date because my dog got several ticks on her in a short walk, she has short hair so it was really easy to spot them and it wasn't a big deal but you should absolutely be careful if your bring your dog in summer)"

TV had a hard time running without just going black. everything worked. Jason was very nice, and instructions were clear. bed was actually comfortable. watch out for seiling fan as you climb the ladder to bed. hit my ass everytime! haha people who live behind it are in and out slamming car doors. there's a kid that rides his dirt bike by every evening and loves to Rev it up as he passes. I felt it more for a couple trying to have romantic and reclusive get away."

The bed in the loft was very comfortable, but my head did hit the ceiling on occasion. I am a tall man.

My only comment, (because I’m a little boushy when it comes to sleep, lmao) would be that if you’re partial to your own mattress bring a pillow or blanket that better suits your slumber. (I did not think ahead!) 😂🫶🏼

Stayed about a week","I want to start by saying the experience overall was positive. The tiny house is a unique experience and Im glad I was able to stay there! The bed was comfortable, the loft it was in small but manageable. Though if youre taller than 5'5"" it may be a bit more difficult overall as the house is short! The shower head and water pressure were mediocre but did just fine. The provided bed linens were very minimal and the blanket was thin and the sheets and blanket felt small for two people to share. There is no sink in the bathroom, though the kitchen sink is just outside the bathroom door. The wifi was quite bad, doesnt work well up in the loft, and we often had to resort to using our data."

Stayed a few nights","Located adjacent to a restaurant/bar. During our stay restaurant/bar held a glow stick / dance party. Music and noise from party clearly heard in loft and adversely affected resting at night. Quietness of location is dependent on the events held by local businesses.
Guests are responsible for hand washing and putting away their own dishes. The cleanliness of the utensils, plates, glasses and cookware dependent on how well the previous guests clean up after themselves. The guest(s) prior to my stay did not clean appropriately as dried food was present on items in cabinet and utensils I took out to use during my stay.
Guests are responsible for determining if any other bedding (aside from sheets/pillowcases) is ""soiled"" and warrants being placed in hamper for washing.
Hair from previous guest in shower and on shower curtain.
Convenient location. Hosts quick to communicate. Clear instructions."

My only regret was moving into the place. My wife and I packed a single suitcase. We should have packed two smaller carry-on bags due to the narrow stairs. Live and learn.
Keep in mind, you are living in a downtown apartment. There may be road noises that you will hear, but this can become so much white noise too.
Marietta is a charming community and the entire region is rich in history, educational institutions, river culture and more."

The living room/dining room area was very open and comfortable, the kitchen was so nice, the bedroom was lovely (and such a comfy bed) and the view outside from the balcony was fantastic.

Kevin came out for two days to thaw out the pipes up to the day before Christmas. Kevin and Cindy were very responsive and did everything they could to fix the problem. When it looked like the problem was going to continue, they even offered to pay for us to relocate. Luckily, the water came back the night before Christmas and we were able to host my fiancee's family for Christmas dinner as they live in the area and their heating pipes had also freezed. We are thankful for their help and hospitality and definitely stay here again if we are in the area."

Stayed a few nights","What a fabulous place to spend a weekend! Cozy layout, uniquely creative decor, charming atmosphere over-all! Everything you need is available. The variety of coffee & creamer on hand was a pleasant surprise! Location is perfect for strolling around town. We loved browsing the shops & being able to walk down the sidewalk for a bite, rather than having to find parking every time we headed out and returned. While in town we attended a concert at the Adelphia Music Hall . . . awesome venue & comfy setup. Everywhere we've ate in town is delicious! A handful of faves: A few drinks at the Riverfront Bar & Grill, Great brews & lunch at the Harmar Tavern, treat yourselves out to a little gourmet at Austyn's, enjoy some local craft beer & top notch foods at Marietta Brewing Co. and this time we did check out Tanya's Country Kitchen just across the street for breakfast as we checked-out in the morning (quantity of food was fine and it was quiet) . . . however, we kicked ourselves for not driving over to the Busy Bee instead. Though they can get hopping the quality & service is great. Can't wait to visit Cindy & Kevin's loft again! Thank you for your hospitality & kudos to your cleaning crew for their immaculate service."

The space was very clean and they provided all of the bathroom/kitchen amenities that you’d need. 10/10 would recommend - I will definitely be back.
Again, the decor in this loft is amazing! I loved the art and furniture! It is full of so many unique pieces!! ♥️♥️"

(The bedroom is at the back of the unit and removed from street noise.) Cindy was a superb communicator. Would highly recommend."

Excellent location to easily get around for a quick bite and to watch basketball before going to a concert at the Adelphia Music Hall. It was a quick trip, but the cozy, convenient location made us feel right at home! The ladies downstairs at Threadz were so helpful when we arrived. Can’t recommend this loft enough!"

There is a dedicated parking spot in the back but there are other parking options in front and nearby. The unit can get loud due to traffic noise but the bedroom was quiet. Overall, very pleased with our stay."

Stayed one night","I rented this space to host boudoir sessions, and it was exactly what I was hoping for! The unique design lent itself well to the lens, and my models were very impressed.
I didn't stay overnight at all since dogs aren't permitted to visit (I have three and couldn't leave them home alone), so I can't speak to that side of the experience. However, I found the listing quite enjoyable overall. I found myself wanting to be there as much as possible.
Pros:
- Location (Surprisingly quiet, surprisingly spacious, great view of Front Street, SO close to many top attractions)
- Overall design/style (especially the Rousch painting, kitchen, neon light near the front window, trinkets hidden in the bricks above the stairs, teal green chairs, prints in the hallway going to the bedroom, main bathroom with clawfoot tub)
- Laundry offerings (though I didn't use them)
- ""Hosting"" amenities (tons of seating options, variety of glassware, cocktail shaker, wine accessories, cigar box, etc.)
- Variety of toiletries in the main bathroom cover all of the essentials (band-aids, acetone, Q-tips, makeup remover, lotions, etc.)
- Huge bedroom closet
- Wide variety of books & chaise lounge was very comfortable
- Check-in and out procedures were extremely easy
- Parking can be rough downtown, but it was very easy and accessible.
- Stairs weren't overwhelming; I expected more of a climb."

It’s in the perfect location on Front Street, has plenty of parking, and is sandwiched between the best restaurant (740 Social) and coffee shop (Jeremiah’s Coffee House) in town. Very convenient check-in and check-out, beautifully decorated with all amenities, it’s a perfect place to stay!"
