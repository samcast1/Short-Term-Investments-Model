Jamie is a wonderful, communicative host! She was easily accessible and friendly!
I would absolutely stay here again!"

Stayed with kids","We travel a lot as a family and have stayed in Airbnb’s all around the world .
Jamie’s house was definitely high among the top best ones .
Easy to find
Great access to Dells and ski resorts around ( 15 min drive ) 5 min away from Baraboo children’s museum - great morning for the little ones .
The house itself is so warm and welcoming , all the amenities and appliances , there was nothing we needed that we couldn’t find .
Hot running water always.
Perfect house temperature all day round .
We especially loved the theatre room , the board games the toddler toys .
There were also kids plates and bowels so we did not need to worry about them breaking anything .
We had a full night and day of snow which added to the festivity of our winter break vacation .
Jamie was super responsive to any of our questions .
The only thing to notice coming to the house is that there are very struck parking instructions that Jamie mentions - follow them .
Thank you for an amazing stay."

Group trip","Jamie’s house was a great choice for my friends and I. The house was clean, comfy and had everything we needed. Check in was very easy and Jamie gave us clear instructions. The movie theatre was a 10/10 very comfy and had lots of throwback movies. The backyard was definitely another one of our favorites, from the fire pit and the seating to the lighting and games. Did not regret at all.
Thanks so much Jamie and Kyle"

Stayed with kids","Bluebell Manor and our host, Jamie, were perfect for a relaxed week in the Wisconsin Dells. The home is really fantastically maintained and well equipped for family adventures.
We repeatedly found just the thing provisioned for our convenience at the house. Lawn games, the fire pit and cooking skewers, the ready-to-go beach bag, and the movie theater popcorn machine all were happily used.
The location in central Baraboo was convenient to groceries, cafes, Devil’s Lake, Circus World, and quick hops to the Dells or an expedition to Spring Lake for Taliesin and House on the Rock. A fantastic place to relax or use as base camp for many adventures!"

We hiked swam and climbed at Devils Lake, and the house is a friendly, well equipped, very clean place to return to for a movie or boars game! We were pleased how well built and quiet the house was...other than a few internal floor squeaks...no neighbor or road noise. The hosts were responsive and gracious!"

Stayed with kids",My family of 5 stayed here. We range in age from 8 to 84 and this house had something for all of us! My mom loved the old record player and other antiques. My kids loved the charm of the old house and we all loved the cute theater room! The house was immaculate and had all the supplies we needed. Jamie was very helpful and checked in a few times just to make sure we had everything we needed. We loved the free zoo-it was a short walk away. The downtown was also a short walk away and was fun to explore. If you’re looking to head to the Dells-that’s just a 15-20 min drive. We liked that we could visit the Dells but not have to stay in that busy area. We all slept great in the comfy beds-we all highly recommend the Bluebell Manor!!

It is a short 15 minute drive to the Dells so we could spend the day at the attractions but could getaway from the chaos and crowds and enjoy the community of Baraboo in the evenings. Highly recommend!

Group trip","Jaimie,
we loved your house and hospitality. I appreciated you going with the flow on who actually, especially when only 2 out of the original people stayed and then I got to spend time with my son and his family. You really helped make the weekend go smoothly during my eldest son's wedding. I knew we were the place to be the second we walked in.
I had issues with airbnb before in NYC and airbnb was great in getting my money back and helped us with everything but after a bad experience, you always are cautious about renting another place. You made it pleasant again.
Thank you"

All sheets and towels were new and super clean! We’ve find so many different useful things like new toothbrushes and toothpastes in the bathroom, a lot of brand new full size body washes, shampoo and many more! We’ve also found many brand new coloring books, pens, pencils for kinds, table games and some other entertainment stuff.
The house had everything you can ask for and even more!
Jamie also was a great host! Super fast responding, easy communication!

Jamie was the nicest person to work with and the location was superb. We found little things around the house that really made us feel at home, we also enjoyed that it was decorated for Christmas. This is a wonderful property, and I would encourage anyone who is looking to stay in Baraboo to check this location out."

Group trip",A few of my friends & I wanted to go hiking at Devil's Lake & were looking for a home nearby. We absolutely loved our time at this home. We will cherish our memories made around the firepit & cooking around the island together. We were only 10 minutes from hiking & found a restaurant near by after our hike. We watched a movie in the theatre room & just loved this cozy unique room. Thank you to Jamie for being so communicative & having everything we could've possibly needed in your home. We have absolutely no complaints & are already thinking about a time next year to return!

Stayed a few nights","This house is awesome and so is the host!! We had a great experience here and we would definitely stay again (:
The house was super clean and everything looked brand new (even the paint on the walls). The location is fantastic. It’s centrally located so everything is an hour or less away, like the house on the rock, Wisconsin Dells, Maddison, Milwaukee, etc. There are a ton of places to eat in town also which was nice. And the host dropped off a HUGE pumpkin for decoration by the front steps and that was a really cute touch. Definitely recommend staying here!!"

Stayed a few nights","The Bluebell Manor is truly lovely! The attention to detail is superb. Each of the bedrooms is welcoming and very comfortable. We were just two but it is easy to envision several couples or a family enjoying the ample spaces, the enclosed front porch, the backyard and grill, the spacious kitchen, living room, AND the movie room.
The shower has wonderful water pressure. Although we didn't use it the tub promises a luxurious hot soak after a day's hike.
The kitchen is well stocked.
Communication was clear and easy.
The house is on a quiet street very close to downtown. We enjoyed the nearby coffee shop and the Village Cafe. This is a wonderful place to stay while visiting Wisconsin's Driftless Région.
We highly recommend the Bluebell Manor!"

Check in was super easy, off street parking was great and coffee and snacks were made available in the home.
I stay in Airbnbs all the time. I have NEVER been in one this clean. It was spotless. The blinds, baseboards, floors and light fixtures were all spotless. There is a crystal light fixture above the dining table that had tons of dangling crystals and they were spotless. I’m a clean freak and I notice these things. Trust me, the place was CLEAN!
The bedding is all crisp and white. The bath towels were white and so so thick. Think 4 Seasons quality. They were THICK.
This place was perfect. Absolutely perfect."

The house was easy to find and once we stepped inside, we immediately felt at home. Vintage style decor was done very well and everything was spotless and clean.
There were many thoughtful touches throughout the home and especially in each of the bedrooms. Extra pillows on the bed, thick, fluffy towels and a floor fan for those of us who need one to fall asleep!
Laura gave us several recommendations for restaurants and things to do in the area. We did several things she suggested and we weren’t disappointed! Charcuterie at The Balanced Rock Winery is a must! As well as Ishnala Supper Club! Yum!
Her home is in the perfect location for peace and quiet, out of the congestion of the Dells, but still only a 15 minute drive away.
We had a wonderful time and I would recommend her home to anyone who wants a home away from home. Well done Laura! We’ll be back!"

Stayed a few nights","Pictures don't do justice to just how cozy this cabin is. It's warm, earthy, full of light, and completely surrounded by oak trees. In the fall, the property is truly gorgeous! It feels very secluded and serene, yet it's a convenient 15-minute drive to Baraboo and all its amenities.
The peacocks are so much fun, greeting us upon our arrival (i.e., peering at us curiously yet cautiously from the deck). Outside, I heard (but never saw, unfortunately) a pileated woodpecker, which was cool. The host graciously gifted us some local honey--a thoughtful touch.
I would stay here again in a heartbeat! I jokingly said to my partner, at one point during our brief stay, that I think the cabin is my dream home."

The rooms were very adorable with nice decor and lots of games/activities if you wish.

Stayed a few nights","This Baraboo Bluffs Cabin is an absolute gem! We stayed with our parents (and dog) to celebrate their 50th anniversary, and we enjoyed a very comfortable stay. Cooked breakfast every day in the fully stocked kitchen (options for Keurig, drip coffee & french press… also tea kettle). We often ate outside on the porch, loved watching the peacocks and hearing their funny call, enjoyed walks through the expansive wildflower meadow, build a couple campfires for s’mores in the evening, and were blown away by the beauty and brightness of the full moon during our stay! Only 15 minutes to Devil’s Lake and 20 minutes to the International Crane Foundation (highly recommend to view 15 species of crane from around the world and support conservation efforts!). There’s an amazing amount of outdoor fun to be experienced in the Baraboo area, and Kristen’s Cabin is the perfect home base for it all! She is a kind and responsive host, and we look forward to another visit to her property in the future!"

The loft area was perfect for me and my boys to have privacy from my mom and give her some quiet.
Being able to grill and have a bonfire with everything provided amazing.
I couldn’t have asked for a better experience.
Even when the power went out from the storm we were completely content. I felt at home and relaxed the whole time. Can’t wait to return to this amazing home.
Oh and even my mom who hates camping and the outdoors wants to come back. That says a lot. Thank you to our hosts for allowing us to stay."

A great place to get away from the city. If you like cooking, this is the place for you. It has everything you need to hole up for the weekend, week, month. Do the monster puzzle. That is all."

Stayed a few nights","We spent a weekend at the cabin and it was simply lovely. The property is gorgeous, and the birds are an added treat. There are several paths to hike right off the cabin, we tackled two and both were fairly easy treks. The peacocks do come up on the deck, and will look in the windows, occasionally one would walk up when we were outside and put on a show for us! I guess you have to be an animal lover to appreciate it, but it is something to see! The roosters are loud, like roosters are, but we got used to them pretty quick. The cabin was very clean, and very easy, specific instructions were left out with some helpful hints on the surrounding area and trails. The owners were not intrusive whatsoever but checked in here and there to make sure we were doing alright which was appreciated. There were even deer standing along the drive to see us off when we left!
Our trip was cut short due to a family emergency, but I would and have recommended this cabin for anyone we know who loves the outdoors and is looking for a nice, relaxing weekend away."

Stayed a few nights",This Cabin was perfect for a mini getaway! We loved seeing the peacocks and exploring the trails outback with our dog. It was a quick and easy drive to Devil’s Lake State park which had amazing views and places to hike. We definitely hope to be back in the future for another visit!

Stayed a few nights","One of a kind experience! This isn't just a quaint cabin in the wisconsin woods...it was so much more! The host was outstanding and the cabin was clean and incredibly well stocked. But the show stopper was the peacocks(!!!), chickens, roosters and ducks which are your neighbors. Since we were there in spring the boy peacocks were trying very hard to impress the ladies so we got a constant show of the brilliant plumage! These guys aren't shy and joined us on the deck (even peeking in the windows) throughout our trip. The little town of Baraboo was also wonderful. Our favorites were the Meat Market and Red Shed, an awesome place to stop for plant/garden lovers. We will definitely be back!"

The location is amazing!!! 15 minutes to Devil's Lake State Park... we were able to get in early morning before the crowds. We also checked out the free zoo in Baraboo. There is a lot to see and do in the area. We would love to return!"

Minutes away from Devils Lake. The cabin itself is super cozy, we loved the wood stove and used it to heat up some soup :) Make no mistake, this is definitely a hunting lodge, but Kristen clearly has put some thoughtful touches into making it a place to connect to nature. The big picture windows make you feel like you are outside. Plus, peacocks! The hosts are very quick to respond to questions and have a great guidebook full of suggestions for activities on the region. Thanks for having us!"

My daughter enjoyed the games and the teddybear setup!! Its was nice stay and we are happy and missed the house while leaving!! Only thing missing in the description is about the parking and its behind the house! Little tough for bigger vehicles to pass the entrance but parking space is more!! Also only the basement door and appearance looks mysterious and little scary :) We enjoyed the swing chair during our stay which makes very special to our vacation!! Also Andrey provided the movies and suggestions on restaurants near by which reduced the work of googling!! totally our trip is completed with more satisfaction most of it from our hustle free stay @ Andrey's place!!!

The place was also ideal with out 11 month old baby, as the kitchen is very well equipped, and the pull-out bed in the second room is basically on ground level. The outside area of the house is a nice add-on, perfect for having a beverage outside after a day of hiking."

I would recommend more baking items like pans and large bowls. Otherwise a pretty well stocked kitchen that’s fun to cook in. If you’re a family that likes to sit down to eat together, the table seats 4 - maybe there was a leaf to add? We just made due and added the bedroom chair - The living room seats 4-5 comfortably too.
Fun backyard with fire pit and garage had a retro pool table, darts and badminton!
Cool Airbnb experience with lots of extra treats upon entry made us feel right at home! Baraboo is a really fun town! We enjoyed Little Village Cafe, Devil’s Lake, Spin Shack, and Tumble Rocks indoor chill fireplace area!

Andrey was very helpful and super hospitable. He gave us a detailed directory of local restaurants and locations to local spots near the sweet home which were very helpful with us.

Stayed a few nights","This little renovated cottage surprised us, in a good way! Almost everything has been redone or at least refreshed with a definite eye to style and is clean, clean, clean. The kitchen is roomy and well supplied with many small appliances, sufficient dishware, table service, cook pots, etc. There is a lovely new bathroom, the beds are comfortable, and the large-screen television works well without your having to be an electrical engineer. Andrey was prompt and courteous with his replies to our texts. We encountered only two little hiccups during our stay. The first involved a rain-swollen door and keypad when we arrived. We had the correct code but a stubborn deadbolt refused to budge. It finally opened for us but we were leery of it during the remainder of our stay. And then there is the matter of the washer/dryer. Please be aware that they are located in the unfinished basement, at the bottom of steep old wooden stairs that are concealed by a hinged floor panel under the kitchen table. Yes. But both machines work well and there is sufficient lighting to mitigate the spooky factor. This house is in a quiet neighborhood, a short drive to the Log Cabin Family Restaurant (recommended!), and offers off-street parking. Rain kept us from taking advantage of the grill, seating, fire-pit in the backyard, but we thoroughly enjoyed the inside of the house. Thank you, Andrey."

Stayed a few nights","At our initial arrival we were somewhat disappointed as the home from the outside does leave a lot to be desired. However after opening the door we were pleasantly surprised at the decor. I am a hotelier spending more than 20 years in the hospitality industry and immediately I could tell that Andrey had some hotel background. I love the soft touches of in shower shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. With further exploration I discovered that there was the addition of toothbrush just in case you needed on as I did. Additionally the kitchen was outfitted with necessary spices, cookware and dishwasher. We also found it very helpful to have streaming services setup for guest as this location is about 15mon drive from entertainment. However we found it a little eerie having the unlocked basement door that’s located within the kitchen floor, with the back door which allows someone to look directly into the home as it doesn’t have a covering over the window. This element made it feel a bit uncomfortable for our liking and also strange as the rest of the house has great window coverings which also limited the amount of light allowed in the house when sleeping for those who have light sensitivity and can be easily awakened. We also had challenges with the door lock which, we found it hard to lock and unlock the door I eventually had to ask my husband to turn the lock with his man strength. Last because the home is older we often found ourselves killing bugs during the day and night and I don’t like bugs of any kind, well except the lady bug that greeted us on our first night. Also my husband who is barely 5’6 was standing up in the main bedroom and his hand hit the fan while it was running and the blade cam crashing down. The fan was very nice in the evenings while sleeping as I tend to get very warm at night but the low ceilings cause the ceiling fan to be a nuisance we had to end up paying to replace the fan rightfully so as it was broken during our stay, but for future guest be careful. We did however appreciate the guest book that detailed stay rules and accommodations such as wifi passcode, what to do in the local area and what to do before we leave and how to prepare for check out. I could tell that all these details were thoughtfully planned and that was appreciated. Overall we enjoyed our stay but we have it a four because of the uncovered window off of the kitchen and the bug issue. Thanks for everything Andrey!"

The whole house was roomy and had all amenities provided thankfully. We felt that everything was clean apart from the top of the fridge which we found out by putting water jugs on top and having a lot of dust bunnies come down on us. We also feel like it is time to change out the inner shower curtain as it was smelly.
Overall we thought that for the price we paid it was worth it. We just wish that the instructions for the checkout chores had fewer things listed especially with the $115 cleaning fee."

Located in town you are able to walk to the restaurants, cafés and local businesses.
It is a great place to just chill or to come home to and chill after a long day out exploring the outdoor activities the area offers.
Devils Lake, Pewits Nest, Parfrey Glen as well as the Riverwalk were a few favorites we enjoyed hiking on our trip.
I am definitely looking forward to returning to this charming home for future visits."

Stayed with kids","This house is so comfortable and spacious! We did a rendezvous with my mom and stepdad with my two small kiddos. We loved the location, the yard was awesome (we made a fire one night), and we slept so well with super comfortable beds and very nice bedding. Its not a hugely kid-friendly home in that there are a number of decorative items that we had to put up to make sure they weren't played with and not a lot of cleaning supplies for messes, but we loved the house. For the price point I think it would be nice to have some extras (coffee, shampoo and conditioner, lawn chairs for around the fire pit) and the checkout instructions were pretty extensive compared to most Airbnb's I've stayed at over the years (pull all the bedding and towels and put in a hamper, bring garbage and recycling out to alley and wash dishes) considering the fees. I still recommend the home for larger groups and older guests. We had a wonderful time!"

The home was very clean, cozy and a perfect get-away for our family of 5 (girls ages 12, 10,8). The bedrooms were spacious and provided amble space to relax, read, and watch tv. The large dining room table was a fantastic meeting spot for meals and lots of game playing. We skied at Cascade on Sunday and I would highly recommend that experience as well! There were many hiking trails nearby that we plan to explore during our next visit. Thanks for a wonderful family weekend!"

The check in process was so easy, the rooms were all perfectly prepared for us, and we appreciated the book with local recommendations.

There was everything you could need and more...a grill, cute patio with patio lights and lawn furniture, a screened in porch, great yard, plenty of parking, quiet street and neighborhood with a great playground less than one block away, adorable town with shops and the house had everything you could need as far as supplies in the kitchen and bathrooms, down to a cheese shredder and every size pot and pan. Cannot rave about this home enough! It was so spacious, comfortable, cozy and very close to the Dells (20 minute drive to downtown). Highly recommend!!!"

We loved the patio and sat out there a lot. We built fires, got bombed by acorns and then heard the deer chomping them at night. Place was peaceful and quiet. We are used to more tv options but we knew that when we booked. It was nice, booked to get closer to Baraboo but would probably go out further next time because of the couch, we had three people and the pullout wasn’t a good sleeping option."

Stayed a few nights","Great home. Greg kept me informed about arrival and self check in with keypad. The place is very new, very clean. Quite well appointed, too. We
Loved the attention to detail. Enough dishes (we did not cook while there, but seemed to have whatever you’d need!), clean kitchen, bright, great coffee set up. We did bring our own grounds, but they have whatever you need.
The upstairs was fun, we put on an album and then watched a movie up there. We put pillows all on the blue funky sofa-thing, and laid back on it to watch movie. The sofa downstairs is definitely a little uncomfortable, and we didn’t need to pull it out, but it’s just not great to snuggle up on and sit and chat. Comfortable furniture is super pricey, though, so what do you do in an Air BNB? It’s tricky!
The place is super clean and well thought out. We would go back. Baraboo is a nice little spot to check out for a couple days!"

We hiked at Devils lake, swam at lake Delton and downtown Baraboo is only minutes away. Location was perfect and so peaceful. We’d definitely stay again for our annual girls getaway. My granddaughters didn’t want to leave!"

Really clear easy instructions to get into the house and everything you need once you’re in.
Beds were super comfortable bathrooms and kitchen super clean!! Highly recommended!!
If you want to enjoy the Wisconsin Dells area, but want some privacy from the crowds this is a perfect place..

We were in town for a ski weekend at Cascade Mountain with our adult children, their partners, and our infant grandson. The house was perfect for what we needed. There was plenty of space in the open living room and kitchen area for us to spend time together and the bedrooms provided each couple with privacy when they needed it.

Instead, we stayed in this beautiful house with a fully stocked kitchen where we cooked seafood pasta, cod brandade and Portuguese style chicken. Piri piri. Crazy thing is that we did price before the hotel stay and the wendys exquisite dining experience and this was cheaper!!!"

We have a 4 and 6 year old sons who quickly found the board game and drawing material drawer. So generous. They loved sharing a cozy and “tall” double bed.
The beds were comfortable and so clean. The space was nicely laid out we felt really together as a family no matter what we were up to. Playing, cooking, watching a cartoon.
Absolutely everything one could possibly need was there. It felt like house sitting, or just being at home.
As a cherry on top, my son left his stuffed kitty behind. I reached out and it was found! We are so excited that child and stuffed beast will be reunited. So generous was the offer to mail kitty our way. 🙏"

It was nice to have a quiet home to return to instead of staying near the commotion of Wisconsin Dells. The interior was really nice and welcoming and the back patio was great for morning coffee and evening wine. The back of the house overlooked a forest, so even though you are in a neighborhood you still feel right in the middle of nature as well. The neighbors were very friendly and helpful as we did walk the neighborhood a few times as there is a park for kids and a walking path surrounding a pond within the neighborhood/subdivision. It was perfect for our family of 7 (parents, grandparents and 3 littles)."

Stayed a few nights","Brian was a thoughtful, generous, responsive host and his property was as advertised. Simple. Cozy. Clean. Comfortable. I stayed the weekend with a friend, but I would feel completely safe coming back alone and using the space as a reading/writing retreat. Brian and his family are right next door and everyone I met or passed in the area smiled and waved. Felt like a friendly community.
All amenities were as promised. My only issues were the faulty shower head which Brian remedied immediately with a brand new one and I never could connect to his WiFi, which wasn’t a big deal as I wasn’t working this weekend. I didn’t bother Brian with that, but I am confident that he would have fixed it right away if I had.
I enjoyed relaxing on the deck and walking the along the river, taking in the sights and sounds. There were some breathtaking views and some beautiful properties to admire. I would love to visit again!"

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I were looking for a place on the water with proximity to both the Dells and Madison, and this place delivered on what we wanted. It's very small and only recommended for one or two people. The setting is beautiful with views of the hills on the other side of the lake. It's set back in an area of backwater channels so you don't really have an open water view from the house, but walk across the street to the park there you can see more of the breadth of the lake.
We didn't realize that canoes or kayaks were available, and we ended up using them one day and it turned out to be a fantasic beach day. There are numerous sandbar areas within a very short paddle from the house.
Our only issues were a musty smell in the bathroom, and the lack of a broom and dustpan, but I'm sure if we asked we could have gotten that. The hosts were very responsive and accommodating and the house was very well appointed."

Stayed with a pet","Our little vacation went well. The weather was not cooperating with our outdoor plans but we took everything in stride and overall had a lot of fun hiking at Devil's Lake and Gibraltar. The cabin was fairly small, but was super cozy and well furnished, definitely felt like home, and the outdoor view of the nearby lake was amazing. For a couple and a small/medium dog, this place is great! The cabin does have a working shower with hot water so that was a plus. I would definitely recommend this home for anyone looking to spend a weekend out in the outdoors, I would probably recommend going either in the Summer time or Early fall, because during the winter it is definitely cold and fairly snowy and that can always impact hiking trails and trips to parks (as it did with us)."

We were able to get some really good pizza delivered per Brian's recommendation. The binder was really helpful with restaurants and things to do as well. Being right on the river was exactly what we wanted for fishing and we are definitely looking forward to coming back during the warmer months. The cabin itself was clean and comfortable! We were able to adjust the temperature inside to our liking which was a plus. Brian is super nice and helpful, I felt I could reach out for anything. I would recommend Brian's place to anyone looking to stay in the area!"

It has a wonderful view of the lake right out the front door with very walkable (as in like 50 steps) access to a park. While our plans didn't pan out exactly as we wanted (poor planning on our part), Brian continued to offer great alternatives for things to do and sights to see. We'll definitely come back when time allows. The ONLY issue we ran into was spotty wifi, but if you're only there to rest, you'll enjoy it."

Stayed with kids","We are a young couple with a 2 year old that enjoys spending time outside. We found this listing pretty last minute as we didn’t know where to stay for our planned days off. When I found this listing I was pleasantly surprised by the affordable price and proximity to several state parks and nature centers.
The pictures of the inside of the cabin are very accurate. It is quite small but has everything you need, and we had a great time staying here with our toddler for 3 nights. The shower has lovely hot water and great water pressure 😊 and whole place was very clean and had no weird or musty smells. There is no stove so we brought our hot plate to make breakfast but we were pleasantly surprised the owners provide an electric skillet to cook in.
We did outings to the Devil’s lake state park, Parfrey’s Glen Creek and the Mackenzie Center. While we can Google what to do in the area, I loved the binder of info Brian provides. It gives you a list of attractions and places to eat and helps to keep you off the phone 😊. We loved the playground across the street and the view of the water.
My only minus is I didn’t realize this was a normal residential street because the pictures show only the inside of the house and the nature, but there’s houses on both sides and a street right in front of the house. Check in and check out was super easy and Brian was flexible with our checkout which we really appreciated.
I’d recommend staying here for a very affordable way to see the area, hike and relax."

Stayed a few nights","This place is exactly as described. It is a rustic cabin. It is tiny so the only way you'll have space is by getting outdoors. Not having a full kitchen became a little difficult for us since we brought our dog with and don't leave her in strangers houses alone. The closest food was 15 to 20 minutes away. It is a good spot though 15 to an hour away from good hiking and towns you want to visit. Hiking on the ice age trails was beautiful and those didn't cost anything. Waking up to the river seeing deer and other wildlife in it was amazing. Watching the sunsets was just beautiful and relaxing. If you stay here I recommend bringing a swimsuit since you can wade out into the water. Now Brian said the bathrooms being redone but I can tell you if your big and tall you will not fit in the shower. We thoroughly enjoyed our time... We wished food was a little closer especially our last day staying there since we got stuck on the side of the road and had to put our spare tire on... So going 20 minutes to get food was out of the question. Also if you're in the area and need tire service I recommend Pomps tire... They're also the only ones open on a Saturday. Yes I would recommend this rustic cabin to any small family or for individuals looking for great fishing, hiking and exploring."

He was very responsive to any questions we had. The book Brian provided he recommended several great restaurants and none of them disappointed. Susie's Supreme from Log Cabin Pizza in Lodi was delicious.
We visited Wisconsin Dells, Devil's Lake, Castle Rock Lake, all within an hours drive from the cabin. The perfect getaway from Missouri's recording break heat. I highly recommend the Little Cabin."

We were blessed to catch the sunset each evening! We ended up planning ahead on the food based on prior reviews and what amenities were shared on the listing page, and everything worked out great. Personally, I feel safer with a double lock which you will find the front door and back door has double locks. There’s a lot to see nearby if you love nature! We drove to a nearby gas station and came across beautiful sheep, bulls, cows, chickens, pelicans, cranes, and more! We (including pup!) highly recommend staying here — and for more than two nights! We’ll be back for sure. Thanks, Brian!"

Stayed a few nights","Brian is very accommodating. For example, he offered to allow us to check-in early as well as checkout later than his posted time. Offered suggestions of nearby places to hike. As well as checked-in with us via the app during our stay to see if we needed anything. This cabin is a perfect size for a couple looking to spend their time taking advantage of the outdoor amenities. It was clean and Brian mentioned that the place sits vacant between guests due to the pandemic. Would definitely recommend to others."

Stayed a few nights","We had an awesome time at Brian’s Cabin! We were right on the water and there was a little public beach across the street that our pups loved romping around on. We had freezing weather and a little rain mixed with snow, but the cabin was toasty warm and the view was second to none. We were able to sneak in a day at Devils Lake and a hike at Gibraltar Rock in between rain bouts. Brian has the cabin stocked with classing games so we played lots of checkers, chess, backgammon, and uno when we weren’t outside enjoying the sounds of nature and the beautiful scenery. Brian was a great host and very responsive to any of our questions. There is a binder inside with lots of recommendations for hiking, exploring and eating. We got pizza at log cabin per the recommendation and really enjoyed everything. We were able to forget for a few days the wild and crazy world around us. Will definitely be visiting the cabin again! Thanks Brian"

My boyfriend and I enjoyed the hot plate so we could make some breakfast for ourselves in the mornings, and we even took the advice of Brian and tried out a local winery which was great! Brian responded right away when we had questions and was very hospitable. I would definitely recommend this cabin to any couple looking for a quick weekend getaway!"

Stayed a few nights","As the other reviews have mentioned, Brian is a fantastic host. Incredibly kind and helpful. He even lent us his canoe, provided us with life jackets and paddles, and took the time to help me carry it down to the water. The cabin is great too! Incredibly cozy, clean, and comfortable, and plenty of space for two people. Even though there is not a full kitchen, there is everything you need for preparing and enjoying meals. There is a microwave, toaster oven, chefman electric skillet, and full-size fridge, plus a gas grill outside. My partner and I had no trouble preparing all of our meals there, which we appreciated being able to do during COVID times. Even more importantly, the location is fantastic. We spent the weekend hiking in Devils Lake, biking on nearby trails, and enjoying the views of Lake Wisconsin from the park across the street. This cabin is an incredible value, and was a perfect location for a long weekend getaway from Chicago. I hope to be back soon!"

Stayed a few nights","Highly recommend this stay. Directly across from the river/lake, the view is beautiful. The cabin is the right size for 1-2 people. As indicated in the listing, the space is best for using as a home base for exploring the outdoors; the couches aren't super comfortable for lounging all day (though we did comfortably watch movies at night). The bed was very comfortable and we slept really well. Everything was neat and clean. Most important, Brian and his family were extremely hospitable, lending us a canoe (they also had kayaks) one day and setting up a fire pit for us another night. Convenient launching point for Devil's Lake (about 35 min away) and other state parks. Also, I was a bit wary of noise seeing the pics of the playground across the street, but it was extremely quiet, with lovely picnic tables for enjoying coffee or meals while admiring the river - and the only public park we found anywhere nearby, so the location is actually ideal."

Stayed a few nights","During Covid-19, my boyfriend and I were looking for a weekend getaway from the city. The Simple Cabin was a great spot to lay our heads after a day of hiking. Brian was very responsive and had a no-contact key transfer, which we appreciated. The cabin was very clean and made us feel comfortable in the space - it is also nicely nestled along the Wisconsin River with views from the front door. We were a bit unlucky with rainy weather but we still snuck in some hikes at Devils Lake State Park and Natural Bridge (each about a 40 min drive from the cabin).
It should be noted that there is no stove, which under normal circumstances would be fine, but was a little harder during Covid and not wanting to eat out at restaurants that much (this is clearly listed in the amenities section of the listing). There is a microwave, toaster oven, and hot plate and we made do! This is a terrifc option for those looking for a quieter getaway and to explore some of the best state parks Wisconsin has to offer."

We, like everyone, have remained at home since March and felt ready for a safe and peaceful getaway. So after very, very careful consideration and research relative to commitment to safety and cleanliness in this chapter of Covid-19, we found Brian’s Simple Cabin and were exceedingly impressed. We found an open date and excitedly reserved it. It was perfect in every way. Brian and his family welcomed us and our Chocolate Lab with tremendous kindness and professionalism. This much needed getaway was peaceful, refreshing, relaxing, and truly beautiful. We will surely return and will also absolutely encourage our family and friends to escape to The Simple Cabin, as well. Glorious!"

The immediate surrounding area is filled with nature and the location is a quick drive through beautiful countryside from many points of interest, including Devil's Lake State Park, nature centers, great small towns, wineries, breweries, the Dells, and great food. Brian and his family were friendly, warm, generous and very accommodating. My friend and I had the most relaxing, rejuvenating and fun time on our trip to Devil's Lake, the town of Poynette, and to the surrounding area. Lake Wisconsin is expansive and gorgeous, and Brian allowed us to take one of their canoes out on the lake. Many people fish, canoe, kayak, boat, and enjoy the sights and sounds of nature. The neighborhood is a perfect place to go for a morning or evening stroll to take in views of the lake, the homes, and the fantastic sunrises and sunsets. HIGHLY recommend staying at Brian's place!"

Although we only stayed there for a night, we’ll definitely be heading back at some point for a more prolonged stay. The cabin is both 30 minutes from Madison and also 30 minutes from skiing, which made this the perfect location to catch a concert in Madison and wake up the next morning and ski.
Brian is a great host. He met us in person at the park in front of the cabin and very easy to communicate with throughout our short stay.
We look forward to staying at the Simple Cabin again in the future, in the winter or summer!"

The Chalet décor inside & out is very comfortable with a relaxing, natural feel. We had plenty of space to hang out and to prepare meals with the open concept on the main floor. We enjoyed the hot tub, a nice feature and very well-kept. Hiked at Devils Lake, enjoyed a local brewery for drinks/appetizers and shopped around in Baraboo. All was within close proximity.

Stayed a few nights","We’ve been living in Chicago for a few years and really wanted to get away for a few days.
Nellie’s chalet was just what we needed. It’s a beautiful A-frame on a hillside, and while it’s tucked into the woods — very cozy and private — you can see the rolling hills and fields (and cows!) beyond the trees from the huge windows and VAST deck.
The space is very clean and open, with a modern feeling. The kitchen has everything you could ever need to entertain (even a wine fridge!). The main room is filled with natural light from the floor-to-ceiling windows, and so comfortable: huge sectional couch, vintage chairs, ambient lighting. There’s a very sleek entertainment system – with a TV and surround-sound music (!). This was a mid-April weekend in Wisconsin, but we tried the hot tub anyway. Fabulous!.
I came to Baraboo to get away and do some writing; my husband wanted to hike and enjoy the (charming!) town. It was perfect for both of us.
Already planning our return trip!!"

Stayed with kids","Beautiful and secluded location surrounded by wildlife and nature. Open layout with tons of windows for natural light and panoramic views. Our family of six was so comfortable here with plenty of space for meals cooked here as well as game nights. Very close to downtown Baraboo as well as the Wisconsin Dells for outings to water parks and restaurants. We opted to upgrade for the hot tub and it was absolutely magical. We can only imagine how awesome it would be in the summertime! Comfortable beds and plenty of seating options throughout the house. Nellie our host was very communicative and helpful, we even grabbed at drink at her Baraboo craft cocktail bar Con Amici and had a really fun time. Perfect get away spot that became our second home for the week, highly recommend and would definitely stay here again!"

Brewery/restaurant is about a 3-5 minute walk. House had plenty of space and beds for us. Very well equipped kitchen and basic toiletries and we didn't have worry about getting anything like garbage bags, dish washer liquid, TP, etc. We went skiing at DH and Cascade which are about a 20 minute drive. Greg answered all questions quickly and gave us a later check out time, so great host as well."

Stayed with a pet",Our family of 11 enjoyed this home. We were able to spread out even though we choose not to use the basement bar area much as it was too cold. (It was negative degrees outside also). Gregg was very accommodating with our extra requests. A well stocked home and kitchen. Nicely decorated with pictures from the area. We also enjoyed pizza and beer from Tumbled Rock . We would return again....thinking about a summer rental. If I had one thing to suggest it would be a good deep cleaning. We had to look for missing toys and found that under the beds and furniture needing some attention.

Stayed with kids","Great cozy, clean cabin for a snowy ski trip. Really enjoyed our stay. Loved the fireplace and great room 😍. We had 3 families stay with 6 kids. Lots of room and plenty of seating. Very responsive host that answered all our questions. The only minor thing we noticed was that the water pressure only allowed one water “thing” to be happening at once. One shower vs dishwasher. Or one shower vs another shower. We worked around this and thought it could have been caused by the sub zero temperatures we had during our stay. Overall we would stay again. The convenience to Devils Lake and both ski mountains can’t be beat!"

Top floor has a primary bedroom with en suite bathroom, another bedroom with bathroom across the hall.
Main floor has spacious kitchen/living room combo with two sliding glass doors that led to the wraparound porch. Also had two bedrooms and a bathroom.
Lower level has a beautiful bar and access to the lower spacious patio that has beautiful furniture and an umbrella. Also has another bedroom and bathroom (no shower in lower bathroom).
Just beyond the lower patio was a fire pit with plenty of seating. We enjoy an evening fire while we listened to music playing at the local bar/restaurant tumbled rock brewery.
Our host, Gregg, was very responsive to any questions we had. Also gave us recommendations on things to do locally. I highly recommend this home."

We used the grill (nice) and brought a griddle; he had plenty of visible propane. We cooked in the kitchen; there were many supplies and plenty of the necessities (bowls, pans, cookie sheets, tin foil, etc).
The location is awesome; it was a short drive to anything we wanted.
The price seemed a little high at first, but i haven't gotten used to the new normal...and after staying there, I think it was well worth the cost!"

Stayed a few nights","We booked our stay after recommendation from our daughter and we are so happy we did!
We drove the last part of our travels avoiding high ways and toll roads and really started enjoying the area, that we would be in for 3 days, and which let us into Babaroo via the back road.
The house is down town and although baraboo has big stores, you have the feeling being in a small town.
On the side of the house is a big enough parking place where you can park your car. The house is in a quiet area and still in the centre. The house is beautifull maintained. You can sit on the beautifull porch and the living room. We felt pampered with the abiltiy to make warm drinks and some sweet snacks.
When you want to visit the area in and around baraboo and visit Devil's State Park, than this is the place to be.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We felt pampered from the start!"

Stayed a few nights","Great experience at this charming, very clean, and comfortable home.
Pam was extremely available to respond to us; gave great recommendations for restaurants and DL Park hiking. She provided many thoughtful amenities, and gave us historical information about the house and the town.
The room has an electric fireplace, comfy bed , mini fridge, 2 nice size chairs and adjoining bathroom. The well stocked snack/breakfast station is right outside the room in a common space. The 1st floor parlor is bright, spacious, comfortable and available to all guests.
We easily found the house. There was a little road work in the area, but it wasn’t a big deal to navigate.
The town is quaint and restaurants and bars are walkable.
Since we were there on a Sunday afternoon and Monday, in March, many stores were closed.
We parked in a lot across the street and felt the car was safe.
Devils Lake is a short drive away.
It’s a beautiful park!
We really liked hiking there.
Excited to come back!"

I walked or rode my bicycle to all the restaurants while I was there. There is plenty to do in Baraboo, Devils lake, hiking, cycling, kayaking, swimming, I even saw some climbers go at it.The Ringling and Barnum and Bailey Circus museum is worth the time. The porch is really something. I had peanut butter pie paired with Chardonnay while enjoying the night breeze on the porch 😆. Baraboo has many really good restaurants. Ike had a mini fridge, microwave, toaster oven, Keurig machine with all kinds of extras. I would definitely go back to Ike's place in the future."

Our guest room, The Quiet Artist’s Retreat” was just that - quiet. The room was ample in size with a comfortable bed, a closet/hangers and private bath (a must for us).

The rooms are both really cute as well with comfortable beds and nice water pressure on the showers. The little coffee/snack station is nice. I definitely would recommend their place."

It is in a prime location, walking distance from anything downtown, and was very clean. There is a fireplace, which is a nice homey comfort if you're there in the long, snowy Baraboo winter.

Stayed a few nights","Ash Street Retreat is a restored, older home in downtown Baraboo which is itself full of history. The room (and private bathroom) was clean, and there was a small snack/amenities area right off the bedroom area in the hallway. Other guests were staying at the same time. Besides occasionally hearing them come and go (steps on the stairway, door closing), it was very quiet and we barely saw the other guests other than seeing some of them sitting on the large wrap around porch. The porch is large enough and has enough seating that 2 or 3 groups of guests can easily be out there at the same time without having the feeling of “sharing” the area. Downtown Baraboo is just a treasure trove of shops, eateries, spas, bars, etc...and all within walking distance. In fact, we didn’t get to do all that we wanted to as we just ran out of time. Steph and Ike provided a binder with much information on local places to eat and other attractions as well as information about the room. It was a fantastic stay, especially for the price. Highly recommend!"

There are two other guest rooms and between them all is a little breakfast station which has fruit, a Keurig coffee machine, water, a large mini fridge, microwave, toaster oven, plates, silverware, and cups/mugs. There is also a small mini fridge in the room as well as an electric fireplace. Floor and bed is very creaky but you get used to it. Big street view window. Wifi is good but the signal has a hard time reaching into this room, and the door is a bit difficult to lock. Just pull it toward you and lock it when you leave. They key is left in the keyhole when you arrive. All in all, its was an amazing stay for us and we definitely recommend it :)"

Stayed a few nights","We greatly enjoyed our stay at this lovely spot! We found the bed, pillow, and linens to be exceptionally comfortable, and the room and home to be spotlessly clean and welcoming. The big bay windows, rugs, and fireplace made the room atmospheric, and it was so nice to have treats, fruit, Keurig coffee, and tea right outside our door. The morning pastries were very tasty!
We also enjoyed the proximity to Baraboo's sweet downtown and the delicious coffee shop right down the road.
The check-in process was incredibly easy. Steph and Ike were available if we needed anything and they were very prompt in their responses to messages!
Thanks again!
Kerry and Mart"

Lots of self-serve ammenities from beverages to snacks plus yummy Danish for breakfast. Cozy touches in the room and common areas make for a great stay. From the looks of the lists of places to eat and see, I feel the need to return and explore more!"

It was sparkling clean, and had many great amenities - from the wonderful furnished front porch to the selection of ""in case you forgot"" items and board games in the kitchen/common area. It's right next to the downtown area, and within 10 minutes drive of Devil's Lake State Park. The free Wifi also worked great on both my phone and work computer. Many thanks again!"

Stayed a few nights","Steph and Ike have a charming home and are lovely hosts. Great communication throughout the whole booking process and during our stay. I'm sorry that we didn't get to actually meet in person, but we did enjoy breakfast at a local diner they'd recommended. Our room was comfortable and full of many thoughtful details- like colored pencils and paper for journaling! It was so nice to have hot coffee waiting for me in the morning. Plenty of healthy snacks available, too. They even had a smart selection of books. And the location was perfect- very walkable! Just blocks from downtown. We also enjoyed exploring the residential neighborhood during our walks to Driftless Glen Distillery and Circus World. Plus, only a 10 minute drive to Devil's Lake. We'd love to return... Honestly, wish I'd had more time to just sit on the porch."

Stayed a few nights","I can't imagine a better place to stay in the Baraboo/Wisconsin Dells area. Steph and Ike's home is a beautifully updated turn of the century building within easy walking distance of all the charming shops, cafes, and in-town activities Baraboo, Wisconsin has to offer. I mean it is directly adjacent to the main town square in an upscale, very safe neighborhood. In addition to the wonderful building and location, Steph and Ike were exceptionally accommodating and their communication was lightning fast. They provided a notebook filled with information about the house and town as well as recommendations for places to eat, get coffee, ect. It was a fantastic experience from start to finish. Before ending this review, I want to make special note of the bed and pillow quality. The bed was so comfortable and the pillows so soft yet substantial, it was difficult to get up and about in the morning. The bed was a very nice touch on top of an all around beautifully furnished and decorated room."
