Stayed with kids","Fantastic views of the lake in a very nice accomodation. We especially enjoyed having dinner outside on the deck and petting the friendly cat. A note about the area, the roads are rough but mostly drivable except for Mountain View Rd. If your GPS tells you to drive there, go another way unless you have an all wheel drive vehicle."

Stayed a few nights","We spent two great days here.
To get to the accommodation you have to drive a few bumpy dirt roads. However, this was already communicated by Paul in advance and well shown with pictures where we need to go exactly. So it was no problem. Unfortunately, we didn't arrive until it was already dark. Since the dirt roads are on the mountain and it goes steeply downhill right next to the path, the drive was a little adventurous.
The place is a little out of the way and therefore super quiet and private. The apartment is spacious and therefore offers plenty of space for children to play. There is everything you need. In addition, there is a great terrace around the house with seating and a barbecue.
The absolute highlight of this place is the view of the lake below. Simply fantastic...
Glad to come back and a clear recommendation from me."

It's a great spot to see over Clearlake and to unwind. Another big highlight for us was that the next door cat (who is very friendly), paid us a few visits!"

Stayed one night","Paul's spot is quickly becoming my girlfriend's and my favorite spot in Clear Lake. Amazing views, comfortable beds, cozy heat sources, good lightning for night time, nice bathroom, great deck and outdoor area. The layout is really well sorted out and furniture and art throughout the cabin flow well. Kitchen is nice and we have made some bomb meals here. Cleanup is easy with the sink right next to oven. Paul was very thoughtful and generous by providing a stoked pantry, fridge and freezer. Nothing feels cluttered and it is a super peaceful, restful, beautiful place to stay."

Stayed with kids","First off, Although the listing says 2 bathrooms, This place has only 1 bathroom. That's misleading info. And the shower in this bathroom is so small and weird. Water shower is either too.hot or too cold. We could barely shower my toddler there. Also, anyone above 200lb cannot step in to take a shower. Needs an urgent renovation.
Then comes dirty kitchen, unclean dishes and the biggest concern - safety. The main door has only one lock and anyone with the code can open it from outside. Given how isolated, in the wild the place is, we felt the need for more security.
The snacks that the host had left for us (which we were initially pleased about) were all expired.
Apart from the location, I cannot say anything good about this place . It needs work and i'm going to avoid this airbnb next time I visit clearlake."

The place itself was breathtaking with the amazing view. Coming in to the house from a very very long day, it was so relaxing. We found it spacious, peaceful, neat, clean, fully stocked (and some more), and cozy.
The outside area is more than what we expected… just amazing and gorgeous.

The drive to the house was a bit rough as Paul mentioned but just drive slowly and carefully and it'll work out. Don't bring a lowered car though!"

The bedrooms are beautiful with large beds. Everything clean and up and running. We stayed 2 days, but would have liked to stay longer. The approach is as Paul writes the last 500 m undetected and uneven uneven. With a Ferrari difficult, normal car is easy."

Stayed a few nights","Great stay! While the lake view is the main charm, it is indeed the house that we ended up liking more.
The kitchen is extremely well equipped with anything and everything one would need.
Drove with a Tesla, and there aren’t any EV chargers. The nearest supercharger is 41 miles at Williams. The regular one is at 30 miles at Twin Pine Casino. So, be mindful on that.
Our car has a low clearance but it managed fine on the driveway leading to the home.
All in all, a good comfortable stay"

The area is also worth visiting: hikes up the Konocti, vineyards nearby (Brassfield is the closest and recommended) and hot springs to relax to (especially during a storm!). Clearlake is underrated and a tourist free destination perfect for a getaway"

Stayed one night","I rented this place for a spur of the moment trip with my boyfriend and it ended up being one of my favorite airbnb experiences. The view alone makes it worth staying here, but the amenities also were above and beyond what I expected. The kitchen is stocked completely with boxed and canned meals, spices, teas, and even a frozen pie in the freezer that we took advantage of. It didn't end in the kitchen though, the bathroom came with toothpaste and everything that guests might need during their stay. I felt like the host put a lot of consideration into the details of the home, which made it overall a very comfortable stay. Not to mention that the house looks over a lake that you can see from the living room through floor to ceiling windows. I would highly recommend staying here, and I will most likely be back sometime in the future!"

Luckily this place was available, and Paul responded very quickly to accept our booking. We didn’t have any expectations because we booked it in a hurry, so when we got there we were very pleasantly surprised. The property has absolutely spectacular views of the lake! I’ve never stayed anywhere that had quite such a sublime view. The home is really nicely kept and has all the amenities, and the uncluttered spaciousness is very appealing. Paul is very responsive and accommodating. We were very impressed with everything about this place, and will return to spend more time in this lovely setting!"

Very attentive, friendly, responsive host.
Check into the area (Clearlake Oaks) - so you are not surprised by the neighborhood. It has seen better days.
Nothing to do with the host- but the place has been hit hard by poverty / drugs, & blue green algae that make the lake not very appealing - up close. Still lovely from a height."

The secluded location truly stole our hearts, offering a captivating view of the serene lake. The beautiful interiors of the house has a user-friendly kitchen and a lake-view balcony. The highlight, undoubtedly, was the charming private beach area equipped with kayaks and a paddle boat. Our Chihuahuas joined in the fun, gleefully swimming alongside us in the inviting lake waters. The memory of kayaking with our furry companions to the heart of the lake, basking in the breathtaking sunset, remains a truly remarkable experience. Our host's exceptional communication and friendly demeanor added a welcoming touch to our stay. We were overjoyed by the hospitality to our four-legged friends. Having stayed in Airbnb accommodations across destinations, we can confidently assert that this house surpasses all others. We extend our highest recommendation to this exceptional Airbnb."

Stayed with kids","We had a wonderful stay. The cabin was so tastefully decorated, and had a beautiful view of Clear lake. The kids loved climbing up and down the loft, and the beds were super comfortable. The fridge stopped working between the time the last guests left and we checked in. Since it was 4th of July, there wasn't a way to get a fridge replacement. I let Paulette know and she had her husband Mike drive 3.5hr to drop off 2 coolers with ice and also fixed the fridge. She even refunded us $ for the groceries. We love AirBnb because it feels like staying at a friend's place instead of a hotel."

The house had all the amenities needed - from a grill, to a paddle boat, to a well-equipped kitchen. The beds were comfortable and the cool AC was appreciated on the hotter days. The host was super helpful and responsive throughout our stay. Can't recommend this place enough!"

Can we stay forever?!” It was decorated so beautiful and had the most peaceful and relaxing vibe. We really enjoyed sitting by the lake, watching the sunset, sipping coffee on the balcony, kayaking, and more. The next door neighbor had ponies, which was a fun bonus to watch them as we played in the lake. The wildflowers were in perfect bloom, too. It was picturesque. It was the perfect end to our honeymoon road-trip. Thank you so much!!!"

My husband and I stayed in the master bedroom which had it’s own bathroom that was stocked with shampoo, lotion, hairdryer, toothbrushes, and even sunscreen. I appreciated that the rooms also had plenty of towels and blankets (i always have a problem with Airbnb places not having enough blankets, but not with Paulette’s place). Since Paulette’s place is a good drive away from the nearest grocery store, my husband and I cooked all our meals and fully utilized her kitchen— which was fully stocked with pots, utensils, kitchenware, spices, oil… all the things you need to cook. Overall, this was one of our best Airbnb stays and we will most definitely be visiting again in the future."

Stayed with a pet","This rural lake house was so charming and peaceful. My husband and I (and our small dog) had a three-day stay and truly felt relaxed and at ease in this well-decorated home. The house is exactly as pictured and described-- it was clean, bright and airy. Although the roads to get to the house were a bit windy and remote, the privacy and peacefulness were what we were looking for. The house had everything we needed and waking up to drink coffee and look at the lake was perfect. We didn't use the kayaks as it was a bit cold for us but we enjoyed sitting by the lake and watching the birds. Our dog had so much fun exploring the fenced-in yard and visiting with the ponies next door. We have absolutely nothing bad to say about our stay at Paulette's place and hope to stay again when we are in that area of California. If you are looking for a rural stay with beautiful lake views, this is your place!"

Dogs were so excited to run up and down the slope to get to the lake and it was really a nice place to relax and wind down. Everything just slowed down. Paulette thought of everything, I mean EVERYTHING. Definitely stock up on your groceries before heading there. Can't beat waking up to the beautiful lake view with a hot cup of coffee. The drive to get there was a little bit more mountain roads than we expected but it was worth it. This was also our older daughter's last Thanksgiving before she heads to college next year. Thank you for such a great memory. Oh also, our dogs ended up making a new friend with her neighbor's big doggy."

Stayed with a pet","We had a wonderful stay at Paulette’s lakefront home! This is a great getaway with both an elevated view of Clearlake from the home and decks and a peaceful large fenced yard that ends at the waterfront with paddle boat and kayak provided. Comfortable furniture outdoors to relax, listen to the lake lapping on the shore, and take in the beautiful views.
Inside, it’s one of the most polished airbnbs we’ve stayed at. It’s true to the listing photos but more spacious than I imagined with roomy master bedroom and additional bedroom and bathroom down the hallway from the open-airy living area as pictured. If you enjoy clean, modern farmhouse design you will especially love this place which fits that vibe to a T.
Everything seemed newly installed and functional and you could tell a lot of care and thought went into making this home a comfortable sanctuary.
And Paulette is super friendly and responsive to boot. Thanks Paulette!"

Stayed over a week","The cottage was a wonderful, good value stay for us and our puppy. We appreciated the isolation and fenced lake access (permanent neighbours to the left who have two dogs, ponies and a goose our puppy made friends with) and what looks like another rental immediately on the right.
Paulette is a quick and helpful communicator making the stay seamless.
We got there when it was very hot so the lake had some algae which reduced as the air cooled and so we could swim. Bring your own bottled water to drink and groceries - closest large supermarket Safeway is 18mins away.
I really appreciated a fully stocked kitchen - every type of utensil and tool to make cooking easy and a fully stocked spice, sauce and mini pantry. Plenty of towels, even toiletries and change of sheets if needed.
The view was stunning, no mosquitos, a lovely fireplace which we managed to use on the last night. Would suggest pre- downloading any movies before arrival as Wi-Fi isn’t super fast for that.
We walked our puppy down a few country roads - nice and quiet despite them being for cars. Activity wise - the nearby towns weren’t for tourists and quite run down. The only destination activity for us were wineries - we went to Landtry, Brassfield and Vigilance which were better than their already high reviews.
We spent most of our time at the cottage so the stay was perfect for us!"

Stayed with a pet","Pros:
The pictures do not lie. The house, the decor, the furnishings, the supplies are all super well done! The loft is excellent for kids and the water front access is fantastic. Beds and linens are all quite comfortable. The house has everything that you need. We found everything easily and did not “wish we had brought” anything additional. The sunset views are amazing.
Cons:
It is remote. That being said, it would be an excellent idea to bring all your food/beverage with you. It’s not a quick hop to the store or local restaurant. Critters, bugs, spiders. Nothing alarming and totally what you would expect in a wooded environment. Just come prepared. Lake water is not reliable (algea free) at certain times of the year.
All in all, this is a great spot for a quiet get away.
Use the hosts’ directions and do not rely on your google maps."

The house is situated between Clearlake, CA and Clearlake Oaks, CA and is about a 3 hour drive from SF. We found that Clearlake Oaks was a more pleasant town to get groceries and other essentials that we needed (including fishing bait). My fiancé loved fishing off of the private beach and he caught an almost 20lb catfish - needless to say he was super excited. We loved staying here and would definitely come back in the future!"

We recommend this place 💯 to everyone looking to relax, enjoy the water lake while staying in a very nice place with beautiful sunsets and views from the balconies!! Thank you so much for everything and for sharing your property!!!"

Stayed with kids","This house is in such a beautiful part of Clearlake. The private “beach” access was really cool and the entire property was immaculately decorated and well designed. My family felt very much at home as Paulette has put a lot of heart into this beautiful house. Everything was very clean, comfortable, and calming. The master bath had the perfect claw foot soaking tub and the wood accents plus dried lavender made for a very relaxing sanctuary. The kitchen is well stocked with kitchenware and essentials like Saran Wrap, aluminum foil, sandwich bags, etc. we brought all of our food for our 4 day stay and it was so easy to cook/grill as if we were at home. The kids and my husband had a lot of fun with the kayak and paddle boat.
It was a lovely stay and I hope we returned the home back just as clean and tidy as we had found it. Thank you Paulette for making this special place available to my family!"

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I have stayed at many many AirBnB over the past 8 years, in several different continents; this place definitely ranks in our top 3!
The location is absolutely gorgeous, with the lake and the surrounding mountains. The house oversees it all and offers such a beautiful view during the day.
The house itself is among the best decorated places we've been. From the art on the walls, to the lamps, to the antique furniture, every last detail is super stylish. We felt like we were in a magazine.
The check-in was easy, and the house wasn't difficult to find (if you put in the entire address in google maps --with the house number). Communication with Paulette was quick and efficient.
We usually don't come back to the same place twice, but we might just do that and stay for longer next time (we stayed only for a couple nights). We loved this place <3"

Group trip","Paulette's place was the perfect getaway from everything that's going on right on. It is a beautiful, secluded lakefront property with lake facing balconies extending from both the living room as well as the master bedroom, with private lake access a quick 5 minute walk down about 20 stairs from the house. Check-in was a breeze with the provided lockbox and the house came equipped with so many nice little touches like board games, puzzles and DVD's but especially in the kitchen which was fully stocked with whatever you might need (pots, pans, spices, oils, full knife set, toaster, coffee maker, charcoal, even gallon jugs of water). As stated in the listing there's no Wi-Fi (the reception is okay though) and the drive can be a bit winding for stretches if you're sensitive to that but I think the secluded aspect is kind of what you're signing up for here? The kayak and paddle boat that are available for use (along with PFD's) are an awesome touch and definitely a highlight of this property! Would most definitely recommend Paulette's place for others and also for myself on a return trip."

Stayed a few nights","We had a wonderful stay. The home is lovely and comfortable and was very clean and the private beach is great. The kitchen was very well stocked. I loved the fact that they are pet-friendly and that the check-in and check-out times are so flexible. The only issue we had is, the next door neighbors have 2 dogs and one of them is quite large (over 100 lbs) - though he is very sweet and friendly, he is also very excitable. We were warned a few days before arriving that the dogs may be in the properties front yard occasionally. We encountered one or both dogs in the yard everyday we were there and on the first night the big dog hopped the fence and was in the backyard, hoping to play with our dog (who is very scared of most dogs). We did not feel safe with our dog in the backyard since we knew the big dog could get in so we drove to a different area to walk her. For most people this shouldn't be an issue because he is very friendly and sweet, but if someone in your party or your dog is afraid of big dogs, please be aware that you may run into him during your stay. We would definitely stay here again, but I'm not sure if we would bring our dog next time."

The next door neighbors also have a very friendly dog who we enjoyed saying hi to and some miniature horses that we spotted a few times!

Stayed with kids","This property is a hidden gem - you won’t find a better location on the lake that has beach access. And the home itself, is so well maintained, clean, beautifully decorated, updated, and has everything you need for your getaway. It’s so hard trying to find a place in a location you haven’t been and we lucked out.
We caught fish, used the paddle boat, listened to the water at night, swam, played games, bbqd, saw wildlife - all from our own private area.
The cell phone reception was great up here, the hot spots worked great, the gps pin pointed us exactly to the address. Going into town was a breeze - the Safeway had what you needed, went out for pizza and burgers at some local spots.
Paulette was so helpful in coordinating this trip for our family and kept us in the loop with local news about the state’s SIP.
We can’t wait to come back!!!"

The location was quiet and serene and there was plenty of parking. During the day, we took the paddle boards out on the lake, went fishing from our kayaks and just lounged on the private beach. We cooked dinner together each evening and sat out on the deck overlooking the lake. We had a super fun and relaxing weekend and I definitely hope to make another trip to stay at Paulette's house. Thank you very much, Paulette!"

We were a little nervous about the stairs to the beach because of a couple reviews, but they were not bad at all, even for a 2 year old. We would definitely stay again if we’re ever in the area."

Stayed about a week","though exterior beach-access stairs were many (also irregular and a bit slippery in November, since exposure is north), and though neighbors were a bit nearer than expected, there were many wonderful things about this rental: hosts were very kind and responsive— generously left us a nice bottle of wine—and the house was scrupulously clean, confortable, and well-equipped. views from within it were lovely.. kitchen was superb (we had relatives visit for dinner, plenty of space). there were some good DVDs, too. We had a happy thanksgiving. one tip: en route in to the property, double-check the house-number sign before making your second turn downhill after entering Fire Rd 8— that 2nd turn is a sharp right (when we came, there was no fish sign there, as corroborating marker, and house numbers are easy to confuse— we went all the way downhill and had to turn around in soneone else’s property). All in all, this was a very nice rental (many on Clear Lake are not)."

Stayed a few nights","Paulette's house was just what we were looking for at Clear Lake, perfect size for the two of us but would be great for a group of 4. The house has a perfect placement slightly up the hill which makes for great views of Clear Lake from the deck, but is just steps away from the water with a private beach. The property overall is very quiet and the beach gets quite a bit of sun during the day.
It's fully equipped with all the amenities you could need for a relaxing weekend - air conditioning, full kitchen, charcoal grill, and plenty of water toys such a 2-person canoe. One thing to note: The house is located about 15 minutes from grocery stores or restaurants so just be sure to bring supplies on your way in.
We'll definitely be back!"

Stayed a few nights","Beautiful home with excellent furnishings and AC. All appliances worked great and some of the items we had forgotten were available to us in the pantry. Lots of board games available for families and groups. The loft area is spacious although the ladder up to it is a little precarious because it's not permanently attached. The back deck overlooks the lake and provides an incredible view. Trees needed to be trimmed to improve the view further. Neighbors are close by on both sides, but it still felt rather secluded. It is lake front property with a small beach that is mostly sand but also had quite a bit of larger rocks. No dock on site, so we had to beach our boat for the duration of our stay.
We brought our 24 foot boat and it was difficult to navigate the boat and trailer down the gravel fire road. It was steep and there were very tight angles to maneuver. The property has ample parking, but it is not large enough to keep the trailer attached to the vehicle. We had to disconnect the trailer and park it adjacent to our vehicle to keep it off the road.
Owner Paulette was extremely responsive to any questions and concerns we had. Overall, this was a great rental for the week."

Stayed a few nights","The place was thoughtfully equipped with all the essentials, including cutlery, coffee, spices, and even shampoo. The host clearly put a lot of effort into ensuring we had everything we needed. Thank you for that. Additionally, the inside was impeccably clean. The surroundings were peaceful, and we were delighted to see some deer roaming around. Thank you for hosting us!
1 thing that can be made better:
- There is kind of a weird skylight in the master bedroom through which tons of light enter starting around 5am. The skylight is different since there is no visibility through it but it amplifies the light coming in. It's exceptionally bright. It messed up our sleep for 2 nights. I informed the host about it and she said they have ordered a cover for it. Hopefully should be fixed in the future."

It is in fact a two story home, however, you are only renting the top. It was clean, comfortable, private and beautiful! We would love to come back for another stay in the future.

If you’re looking for a peaceful getaway with great amenities (barbecue, firepit, outdoor deck, fishing equipment and more) to make it even more special this is the place. She really thought about the little things and the house was so well equipped with everything which made us so comfortable.
The view of the lake and the sounds of the birds in the morning is amazing. We also got to see Otters visit the deck downstairs on some days. The lake does get an algae bloom in the summer which makes it green but that didn’t bother us. The location and surrounding areas are very residential and quiet.
Brassfield Winery is a 10min drive and a must visit if you like wine! There are also some nice restaurants a drive away.
Thank you Elizabeth for a wonderful getaway!! We will definitely come back."

A couple minor tips if you are considering the place - 1) sound-proofing isn't the best so I'd bring some ear plugs if you are with a larger party. 2) The kitchen has most things you need, but the knives are not the best; would bring a set if you are planning on cooking at home. Otherwise, the place was wonderful!"

Stayed about a week","The place was very relaxing to come home to after long work days. The deck was a perfect hang out area to catch the sunsets and enjoy the sounds of the birds.
We were happy with this accommodation except for not having access to any cleaning supplies or additional laundry pods (we were provided 3 pods). My coworker and I lived here for 10 days and would have loved to have access to the cleaning supplies. We ended up buying our own detergent to wash our clothes, which isn’t that big of a deal, but we had just assumed these would be part of the basic amenities.
We enjoyed going out in the pedal boat one evening and overall thought he place was great. Thanks!"

Stayed with a pet","Our visit was amazing. The house was clean and packed with everything we needed. I realized I forgot to bring toothpaste, but there was a little goodie bag by the front door that included it in case we forgot! The binder that's provided has all the information and instructions from check-in/out to how to use the appliances. We really appreciate the suggestions for food and activities in the area. We used the pedal boat the two full days we were there and had a blast. Theres also accommodations for dogs and treats in the cabinet. Our only issue was that upon entering, there were tons of mosquitoes around the front door, and many got into the house since it was a bit warm inside. Once we turned on the A/C, they all started to freeze up, fall to the ground, and we were able to sweep them up then. We would definitely stay here again and plan on making an annual trip!"

Stayed a few nights","I grew up in the Oaks in the 80s and 90s, so this stay was very nostalgic for me. The location couldn't be better, as it is near the end of Keys Blvd, right off the main lake. Due to being so close to the main part of the lake, the algae is less present and the travel time to the main lake is within minutes!
The house was perfect for our trip. I actually thought the house looked better in person than in the pictures. No details were spared in this house in terms of comforts. The place is bigger inside than it looked in the pictures, somewhere around 1700 square feet.
There was plenty of driveway space for 2 cars and a boat trailer! I loved being able to back in our boat trailer and keep it off the street. This was a major plus. I would highly recommend this place for families and those that have a boat that need a place that can accommodate. The boat dock was perfect for our small ski boat. We plan to book again next summer!"

Stayed with a pet","We had a great time at Heron’s Nest. The best part is the large back deck. The pictures don’t do it justice. It was so nice to have a large, fenced space right off of the living room to enjoy with our young kids and small dog. We shared many meals outside and I enjoyed sipping my coffee in the mornings and watching for birds and otters. The AC worked very well and we had everything we needed for a long weekend, including a couple of games and puzzles.
I was a bit worried right before coming because I couldn’t find much online about the area but there is an impressive binder of information in the listing. We took the kids to one of the beach parks about 20 minutes north and they enjoyed playing in and at the edge of the water and on the playground. We also visited the Fosters freeze on a warm day for soft serve. Other than that, we really just wanted to be at the house and enjoy the canals with their paddle boat."

I was given compensation for my inconvenience; greatly appreciated but unexpected. This house is perfect, comfortable, beautiful, the boat dock is perfect and can accommodate multiple watercraft. The kitchen has everything, the towels and linen and dishes are all high quality. This house is spotless, you will love it. There is ever attention to detail with games, books, you name it .

Overall, they really made it feel like a home away from home, very beautiful and comfortable!"

Group trip","Rich and Sharon's home was a quaint place to stay for our short weekend. As you walk in, you'll notice everything is clean, kitchen cabinets organized with labels, and beds perfectly made for your arrival. The color scheme of the whole house is just calming that you do feel like you're on vacation.
Make use of the informational binder that will give you restaurants, historical places of interest and things to do in the surrounding towns, as well as all the info you need to take care of their home.
The backyard patio not only was a great place to watch the sunrise and sunset but also to birdwatch and barbecue some dinner. We also loved the topographic map of Clear Lake on the wall!!"

Location was perfect, right on the water and we were able to fish off the boat dock. We even caught a few catfish! Also, the wifi was fast enough for me to work one day while I was there and join conference calls on my laptop. This place was perfect for relaxing on the lake."

Stayed with kids","Blue Heron's Nest really meets the hype in terms of location and overall amenities. Our kids loved the deck and the peddle boat, and it was great to just get away from the city for a few days of hiking and boating. The space was well cleaned and there were many small touches to make the stay comfortable (I found the novelty Clearlake Monopoly game to be a nice touch of local flavor!).
We had an unexpected water shutoff during our stay which was somewhat frustrating, but Rich and Sharon were very accommodating to help make our stay more comfortable in spite of the difficult circumstances. They were very responsive and available for communication and in helping us through the situation. It seems like it was a one-off line repair affecting the entire street, and not anything to do with the house itself; so I wouldn't anticipate a repeat situation."

With the nice weather out we spent most of our time out back and were still able to get in a considerable amount of hours of fishing done since there’s a dock right out back to have your boat. The owners are super helpful and quick to respond as well. And they stocked plenty of extra supplies for us (towels, soap, kitchen necessities, etc.) We had another great time staying here thanks to them. We’ll definitely be booking again!"

Property is very nice and clean with a great floor plan and amenities. House was stocked with those little circle hotel hand soaps along with a shampoo, conditioner, and body wash soap dispenser. This was super thoughtful for their guests. For those fishermen, the deck is large and the dock has room for more than 1 boat. House is also located in the first subset of canals so it is protected from the wind and also fast access to the main lake when heading out.
Overall, experience was great and would definitely recommend this property to any fishermen and family looking for a vacation."

It is right on the lake with an attached private dock. The algae bloom was in full swing - so we couldn’t swim from the dock. The algae smell was noticeable but we got used to it within the first few mins & was not dealbreaker.
The house itself is well appointed & has the basic needs met. Overall, a pleasant & enjoyable stay!"

Stayed with kids","House is as advertised, small and clean, right on a channel off the main lake, and one of the best kept on the block. The owner Rich is very nice guy and an excellent communicator. Check in/out super convenient. WiFi was better than expected, 4 kids had no issues using iPads, phones at the same time and even streaming on apple TV, kitchen has most of the basic amenities. The large deck outside was very enjoyable and kids can fish for little blue gill off the dock which was fun. Having a paddle boat is a plus, but check that Rich has fixed the handle before using, my son went out and got stuck because of broken handle/rudder, a very nice neighbor towed him back to our dock. I asked owner in advance about swimming off the dock and was told that in July it should be fine and algae doesn't bloom happen until later in the summer, however when we arrived the water was like pea soup with algae that was so thick, and smelly, nobody would want to swim in it (we were there July 8 - 13). Also the dock next door looks to be abandoned and is covered with dozens of ducks and their feces, this likely adds to the muck in the water. That was our only disappointment because it was 97-100 degree highs every day and nowhere to swim. Also we got invaded by rice flies which were so abundant I have never seen anything like it. Thousands of them literally. Again this is not the owners fault but it did affect our stay, we thought they were mosquitos at first so a little heads up about them would have been good. Otherwise, I highly recommend this house and for the price, it was an excellent value! Thanks Rich & Sharon!"

The rooms and beds were so comfortable, and the view from the back of the house was amazing and relaxing! The place is on the water, and you also get beautiful views of the mountains. Rich and Sharon left some small touches like a nice note, a small bag with a notebook, popcorn, spare toothbrushes in case we forgot ours (which we did), and complimentary wine tasting passes at the local Brassfield Winery, which made us feel very welcome. There is not too much to do in clearlake oaks (we went mainly to relax and be surrounded by natural beauty) but Brassfield Winery is worth a visit for the views and the delicious wines grown, produced and bottled on site. We had a great weekend and would love to come back to stay if we are ever in town again!"

We'd wake up and have our coffee on the back deck over the water and watch the birds flying from tree to tree. The neighborhood feels very safe and is very quiet. We appreciate all the special touches and definitely highly recommend this place, which we would be happy to return to."

Group trip","The Heron house was a perfect place for our small party of 7. The house was clean and there were little helpful and funny little notes placed all over the house to help us enjoy our stay. Very easy and close access to Clear Lake via the canal. We used the paddle boats, floated down the canal with our own floaties and grilled yummy food. We perched on the spacious deck for most of our stay and it was lovely. With friendly neighbors and good vibes I'd stay at this adorable place again and again! Thank you Rich and Sharon for providing a sweet and easy place to hangout and have fun with dear friends."

Really the perfect Airbnb! Clean, Quiet, simply decorated , Very comfortable bed, Excellent kitchen. Coffee, tea. Easy to prepare our meals. The best water pressure for an outstanding shower!! Even a washer and dryer were available. Excellent Wifi, we had to get some work done during our stay. We loved the bird feeder on the deck. They were very active and fun top watch! We enjoyed a very nice dinner at The Country Kitchen and an excellent sandwich and smoothy at Buddy's Coffee! (both in Clear Lake Oaks) Thank you Janelle and congratulation welcoming your newborn during our stay at your ""Cozy Cottage"""

Stayed a few nights","My hubby & I love going to Clear Lake to just unwind from urban life. Janelle's place was a great location on the quiet side of the lake with a view! It's also its own freestanding building. There are birdfeeders on the front porch which made it fun to watch the swallows, hummingbirds & other birds in action. Driving around the lake, I didn't realize how many vineyards are planted! So coming from a winemaking family, I wanted to learn more & asked Janelle if there was a 1 stop shop to pick up a variety of local wines to bring home. Janelle right away conferred with her network & gave me the name of a grocery store that carried many local wines. We ended up driving there to pick up a dozen bottles!
If you are new to the area, I would also highly recommend the Visitor's Center in Lake Port on the west side of the lake - very informational & helpful! We are looking forward to staying at Janelle's again in the future."

Love the washer and dryer in the unit, and pretty much has everything you need to cook. If you plan on coming here, be prepared to cook. There are not a lot of places to eat around there."

We loved waking up tucked away in the trees and spending a peaceful morning on the private deck. A perfect way to get some space from the busier Napa area while still being close by, and enjoy a truly beautiful part of the state (right on California's largest natural lake!)."

Our car was broken down in the middle of the road on our way to our Airbnb and Janelle offered his help by driving all the way from his residence and gave us a ride to his Airbnb. It was a long way round trip but he provided prompt help anyways. He also gave us a ride to the car rental place the other day so we could get back home on time. Our family was very impressed with how he helped in our unexpected situations and made our trip as enjoyable and smooth as much as possible.

We could hear the bass fishing tournament speedboats roaring to get to the best fishing spots first and then quiet splashing of the lake during the evening. We BBQ'd burgers and chicken both nights on the deck and loved the atmosphere. Mosquito free summer breeze and a cold brewski, hot chicken what more could you ask. Really appreciated all the kitchen amenities. Plenty of towels and everything we needed. We enjoyed watching about 3 dozen birds devour a yard of bird seed Janelle leaves in the freeder and then as the stars come out you can see satellites and shooting stars. 10/10 would stay again."

Stayed a few nights","Loved the place! It was updated, cozy and had everything we needed for a group of 4 women. The deck had an amazing view of the lake and the AC kept us cool.
The only downsides were two things. First, we got locked in the master bedroom because the door got stuck and wouldn’t open. We were eventually able to open it after about 8 minutes of wiggling and turning the door handle different directions, but it did give us a scare! We kept the room door cracked after that instead of closing it completely.
The second was the amount of bugs outside! We wanted to watch the meteor shower on the deck, but there were so many bugs gravitating towards the sliding glass door that we didn’t dare open it! Maybe some kind of bug lamp would have helped or maybe that is just how it’s bound to be, due to the vicinity of the lake."

Bathroom is tight but workable and nice to have plenty of kitchen amenities. Got to enjoy a cup of French Roast while watching the sunrise and many little birds feed off the feeders. I’ll definitely be back!"

It had great views of the lake and it was very peaceful and quiet which was something we definitely needed. The outside deck and patio was a fun place to be. We saw so many birds eat on the bird feeder. The entire house was immaculate and clean. We will definitely this if we need to escape Sacramento.

The describtion of this place says it has room for 6 people. As a family of 5 (2 adults and 3 kids aged 6,7 and 12) we felt the place was a bit to small. I don’t see how 6 adults would ever fit into this place. There is two nice queensize beds and a VERY small sofabed, 4 dinning chairs and a very small dinning table, only 4 plates, 3 knives etc.
Its would be much true and fair to call it a place with max capacity of 4 pers."

Stayed a few nights","Janelle was communicative and kind. The place wasn’t quite what we were hoping for. The sheets had an odd smell. Luckily, there is a w/d in the home. There were a few Cheerios on the ground near the table when we arrived. Most likely from the last guest but it was discomforting to see things on the floor like that when first arriving to a place where you plan to stay for a mini vacay.
We were only staying for 3 nights and ended up leaving the 2nd night due to the interesting smell of the home. It seems like someone was aware that the house needed to be aired out because the kitchen and bathroom windows were cracked.
Positives: The view is lovely. The host is helpful. There was filtered water in the fridge. The decor is cute! There is W/D. The tv has Netflix and other things like that."

We stopped by Stonehouse Cellars for breakfast, where they had free EV-charging stations for our Tesla.
In summary, this place is great and you should give it a try.

Stayed a few nights","This charming lakeside cottage has a beautiful picture postcard view of Clear Lake. You drive up a short winding road, to reach the house. Once there, you have plenty of parking, just a few steps above the house. There is a comfortable side deck & a front deck. The front deck was being rebuilt, during my stay, though the owners respectfully did not work on that deck, during my short stay. I really enjoyed the side deck, with a table & pato umbrella, for the shade. In October, the days were hot, but the nights were cool. I had a strong internet/WIFI signal. There is a table, near a window, in the living room, with a side lakeview, if you need to work virtually. The kitchen & living room have an open airy design. I found the couch comfortabe, as well as the beds. The one bathroom was small but comfortable, for 2 couples or a small family. There was plenty of hot water, when taking a shower. The views of Clear Lake, especially out the living room window & from the 2 decks are exquisite. I was very relaxed, at this lakeside cottage. Checkin was easy. There was a split A/C unit, where the ceiling & wall meet, in the living room. It cooled the cottage comfortably, during the hotter days. And, each bedroom & the living room had ceiling fans. The kitchen had plenty of supplies, to cook a meal. This lakeside cottage would be a comfortable place, for a long term stay, as well. The owners responded quickly, to any of my questions. I would definitely stay, at this charming lakeside cottage again."

Stayed with a pet",We just stayed 4 days at Jason’s and Fiona’s lake house. The sunrise’s were amazing. Just like a postcard. The house was decorated awesome. I had to remind my husband who was the Queen of Pac-Man. I reminded him over and over. His game was pinball but it was out of order so he couldn’t school me in it. We had a ton of fun. The beds were so comfortable. We enjoyed soaking in the tub. It truly was a perfect and private view of the lake. We felt very safe in the neighborhood and everyone was friendly. We can’t wait to go back.

The house is right on the lake on a cove where there was tons of wildlife and great fishing. Jason was very accommodating was very responsive and gave us great recommendations for things to do and places to eat. We caught many fish right of the dock in the back. The backyard area with nice deck and fire pit was a great place to grill dinner and unwind at the end of the day. Clear lake is a beautiful spot with great fishing and sightseeing. We will be back for sure and recommend staying here!!"

Cool game room with arcade games and emulators, bumper pool, darts, etc. Great back yard patio for hanging out, immediate access to the water but we didn't use it because the water in the south of the lake is more algae-filled in Summer so we went more north for day trips. Easy access to Clear Lake area amenities. Thank you Jason!"

Stayed a few nights","House was great. Lake not so much. Smelled “worse than ever” per the locals. Went here to fish and get away some. Fishing was hard due to the lake algae and smell. Dock was not usable and water was far from swimmable. partially our fault for not knowing this place smells horrible in the heat and the lake is nearly toxic and unusable in summer.
House was nice. Good ac, nice stuff, good decor. The game room was nice and a must during smelly summers.
Property is fully fenced in. Our service dog enjoyed that. Deck and outdoor hang out space was nice and open. House was cool during the day. The solar helped us not feel bad for cranking the ac, as did the skylights.
Good: game room, comfy beds, big tub, good ac/cooling, good parking, water access (when it’s clean and not toxic mold in the lake.) very kind neighbors (one of em offered their dock for my boat and saved my trip.) good food in town, easy to get to everything.
Not as good: place was pretty dirty. Bugs about. Like spider webs on the doors and little bugs that weren’t ants on the floors all over the house that made it to our house upon unpacking. Dishes in the cabinet were all pretty dirty, leftover food in the fridge. Shower was not clean. Not the hosts fault but the tap water tasted like the air smelled. Bad. Bring a flat of bottled water and cook / drink that. Raccoons everywhere. Day and night. Again, you CANT escape the smell.
All in all, we enjoyed most of the stay. Just be advised: if it’s hot, this place is going to smell like the worst open sewage you’ve smelled. We held our stomachs back every time we opened a door. I threw up fishing several times while on my boat on the lake. I’m going to try to come back and have a redo of the fishing when the weather cools. See how that goes. If it’s nice, I will return yearly to fish.
Host was communicative and available but assured us there was no smell at the house and there definitely was.
Suggested with the caveat you go when it’s cool, and call ahead to places in town about the smell. Next time we try to go here, I’m calling Kour Thai (literally at redbud park/marina) and asking them for a smell report and catfish coffee as they all had great tips on non fishing lake related activities.
Also if you are fishing here, with a boat, you need to SCRUB your boat asap once it’s out of the water or it will stink forever. You need a lake county quagga inspection and stickers before you launch. This is avail at either of the tackle shops in town for ~$20. Clear lake tackle had way more stuff but limit out fishing had the good info. Dude set us up with amazing tips and made the trip. Game plan for us was drop shot and top water early early morning. Afternoon wind makes small boats impossible to pilot."

Comfortable beds, a fully stocked kitchen (and conveniently located Safeway), luxurious soaking tub, mini arcade, board games, books, as well as gorgeous morning and evening views from the backyard are what you’ll find here. I was unfamiliar with the area but found it to be quiet and peaceful. Neighbours could be seen maintaining their properties/front yards in the mornings and afternoons and it was exceptionally quiet in the evenings, both on weeknights and weekends. The home features many stylised pieces indicative of the hosts’ personalities. The pups and I enjoyed our stay and wouldn’t hesitate to return! This is a great spot for any looking to explore the outdoors (or enjoy a relaxing weekend inside). Thank you for sharing your personal vacation home with the rest of us. We particularly enjoyed the sunflower garden. :)"

Nice surprise to find Chromecast connected to game room tv, and there’s a very large smart tv in second bedroom.

Pictures were pretty spot on, the water was really low but, being on kayaks allowed us to use the dock and get on and off the water easily.
Jason was awesome in responding in a timely manner! He gave us great recommendation to use a local bait shop to find spots near us. Well before our trip, Jason was beyond helpful.
His house was the perfect size for us, it came with everything we needed in the kitchen. Comfy beds we chose to sleep in the spare bedroom and got wake up to beautiful lake sunrise views.
Needless to say, we loved this spot and already planning when we can come back."

Stayed with a pet","We had a nice relaxing weekend away at Jasons.
There were a lot of thoughtful activities available at the home:
-Pinball machine, chess, Wii, board games, Pac man arcade, books, billiards, binoculars for animal watching, etc.
- The home was well decorated and gave a good glimpse into who the owners were.
-Jason was always reachable by message via the Airbnb app.
Great for a couple or a small family. For more guests, privacy may be an issue. As the guest bedroom is completely open to the living area, which may be difficult for occupants trying to rest while activities are going on.
The tub required a bit of finessing and never got truly hot. Taking a lukewarm bath is not the greatest experience. I think this was one of the only misses.
Thanks for a nice time."

Group trip","Jason’s place is as described in the listing - whimsical with a lot of character, well stocked with many games (we had a lot of fun playing bumper pool) which was very helpful since we were there during a heatwave so had to be indoors more than we would have liked, and with hospitable touches like coffee and paddle boards and a grill.
As a PSA, we ended up deciding to not swim or paddle board in the lake, since it was reported to have a very high level of mercury - we had read about the cyanobacteria/algae beforehand and were prepared to go to different parts of the lake that had lower levels of algae, but decided to be safe due to the mercury. So for the day we had planned to do lake activities, we ended up taking a day trip to Mendocino to hit the beach."

Tons of activities provided such as game boards, a bumper pool, a tv, a pinball machine, and a lot more. During our time here, we even had a deer come into the backyard and stay for a while. It is about a 10 minute drive to anywhere. To Walmart, to any food stores, the supermarket, to fishing, etc. Highly recommended for family trip."

Stayed a few nights","Jason’s house is a tale of two stories. The first is the house and happy to say it’s fabulous. It’s pretty much on point in every regard plus has so many great extras such as toiletries, various little snacks and games galore! Seriously there’s everything and more including pinball, bumper pool, Nintendo. Etc etc. there’s also a stellar DVD and book collection! It’s somewhere you can happily stay indoors for weeks... and that brings me to the second part of the review, you just may want to stay inside! The house is not in the prettiest part of Clearlake... by a long way. We tried to find somewhere to swim in the lake, which is not easy but then discovered the lake suffers from a severe algae issue that can make you very sick and kill your pet. Whilst it doesn’t occur all year round, it was enough to put us off. If you prepared to do some driving, or want to stay inside in a fun house... you will have a great time!"

The location is perfect for a lakeside vacation, with direct access to the water and tons of wildlife all around (we saw otters, a heron, eagles, and deer just to name a few). It's blissfully quiet and peaceful without being isolated, with nearby restaurants and stores and tons of local wineries and other attractions. The house is roomy, comfortable, and artfully decorated; Jason has also provided tons of extras to include everything you can possibly need. He responded very quickly to all our questions and offered great suggestions of what to do during our stay - we took his advice and had a great time! This place is absolutely perfect for a relaxing, fun vacation."

The only thing to take into account is that the rooms don't have doors, but a sort of shade. Although you cannot see anything, it does take away some privacy. We were two couples, so we did not love this. Aside from that the house is perfect!"

Stayed a few nights","This house is awesome! We booked last minute with friends for the long Labor Day weekend holiday and the hosts were so great with communication - super quick to respond and thorough responses. Because I was unfamiliar with the area, I sent multiple questions about the location, set-up in game room for the TV, air conditioner, water quality, etc., etc., etc. (ie I was probably annoying) but they were nothing but kind and helpful. They even gave us a great tip about a boat rental place and to visit the county fair!
The house is well stocked, we were there and stayed in and cooked and played games all of the evenings. The little cove where it is located is calm and quiet for slow tranquil mornings (we watched river otters on a pier across the way!). The master bed was very comfortable and the guest room with the pull out bed was as well (as comfortable as a pull out couch can be). The only thing to not is that the house has a very open floor plan, which we loved, but that means there weren't any real doors between rooms (other than the guest bathroom). There were headed curtains for the master and a cool a old school pull down map to cover the archway for the guest room creating some privacy, but something to keep in mind when you consider who you will be staying with at the home. We loved it and thought it helped create a more cozy, family vibe.
Would totally stay again - thanks!"

Stayed a few nights","Jason and Fiona's house is perfect for a getaway! The house is quirky and fun and situated on a quiet little cove. There are lots of games to play and our son loved the bumper pool table, Wii and movie selection. But the reason he played those things instead of playing in the water was because dangerous blue-green algae filled the cove our first morning with a thick layer and never left. This type of algae is a common problem on Clear Lake and is unpredictable. If you have a boat, no problem because you can head out to areas where the algae is not an issue. But if you plan to swim off the dock, be aware that might not happen at all (and don't let your dog swim if it's present)!
Jason was a very responsive host and their property management crew was there to meet us and show us around when we arrived. This house was a great value.
One important tip: don't jump or swim between the two sides of the U-shaped dock! There is a submerged metal bar that connects the two halves towards opening where you would pull a boat in that is not at all visible from above. I nearly jumped directly on it which would have been a disaster. I hit it hard with my knee and then kicked it, too. Very dangerous, so be aware!"

The cabin and the area around it is really quit so it's perfect if you are trying to unwind and relax. The view to the lake is hidden from the lake since there is a big cabin in front blocking the view. But, overall we had a good experience and would defiantly recommend it."

The view is breathtaking and the space allowed me to experience all 4 elements, earth (mountain), fire (volcano), water (Clear lake - largest body of fresh water in CA), and air (cleanest air with a cool breeze as you sunbathe). Come relax and soak in the beauty of Marlena’s wonderful space.
Also, you can go hike the view! About an hour away called Mt Konocti Hiking Trails.

The home is beautifully decorated, and we found ourselves finding something new that caught our eye each and every day. Obviously, the main reason we booked the house was the view, and it did not disappoint. I recommend going out on the patio at night and stargazing, as the lack of light pollution makes for an incredible sky sight.
By the time our stay was over, we found ourselves finding every excuse to not leave until the last few minutes. Whether you’re looking to book a home to lock yourself in for a weekend, hit the local towns, or whatever else tickles your fancy, Marlena’s home will give you the experience you’re looking for."

It's remote and private and has everything you need to relax and enjoy the beautiful views (including an extra toothbrush which came in handy night 1). The beds are comfy and everything is set up perfectly to host. Our 2 year old loved running around the property and playing with the outdoor Jenga blocks. Sunset is amazing as was the stargazing. Highly recommend!

Stayed with a pet","Going back to stay again at Summerset is us voting with our feet (positively). The place is just as described, the views and the comfort of viewing from the deck, whether soaking in the sun or views of the lake and Mt. Konocti during the day or pristine views of the night sky in ""Dark-Skies"" friendly Lake County, are simply mesmerizing and accounted for most of our stay. Do take note of Marlena's recommendation to complete grocery shopping before arrival at the property because it is hard to leave the property once you're settled in at Summerset."

Stayed a few nights","Marlena's place is lovely, and she's a fantastic host! The views were fabulous. It's a really nice place to relax and do nothing and is very quiet and isolated. Even though she was on the property, she completely respect our privacy, and we felt very comfortable. I loved taking a bath with views out onto the water! My original plan was to spend all our time on the deck, but it was extremely hot and very windy while we were there. We spent a lot of our time inside instead, so plan for that as an option. The one bummer was that the curtains were very light, so I was up at sunrise both days instead of getting the chance to sleep without the kids. So bring an eye mask if you're a light sleeper! Marlena is a super easy and communicative host, and it was incredible to have such an easy check in and check out. In the last few years, the ""checkout"" list for some airbnbs has felt increasingly difficult. Hers was an absolute piece of cake! Would definitely recommend this spot. :)"

The house is very comfortably laid out and it was nice to have a big living room to hang out in all day. We brought our infant and had lots of space to arrange her playmat, pack 'n' play, bouncer, etc.
There was a huge rainstorm during our stay that knocked out the power for about 9 hours, which meant that the electric stove, microwave, refrigerator, and heating didn't work. Marlena took really good care of us and brought us dinner! The house is well insulated, so even though it was cold outside, we were comfortable without having the heat on.
Thank you for the wonderful stay, we will be back!"

We spent so much time out on the deck and relished every single moment. The privacy and lack of noise was fabulous (I questioned my hearing at one point because there was NO noice. NONE Thankfully a bird chirped and I was relieved to know I could still hear). The amenities of the house were much appreciated as trips to the grocery store aren't as easy as a straight shot down the hill. But if you're ready to disconnect with technology and connect with nature and all it's beauty, this place is THE place. Hope to come back again in the near future :-)"

Wonderful selection of DVDs, CD collection, and board games. Be prepared to hunker down, especially come nightfall, because getting to/from the home is a 20-min drive each way into town with a stretch along narrow bends and minimal light, so plan your outings and food wisely. Overall, we had a wonderful stay!"

We were looking for a place where we can really disconnect and Marlena provided just that. I hope we are welcome back because I would love to stay here again and again.

Stayed a few nights","We travelled from San Diego to celebrate my 40th birthday. There were 4 of us. The location was wonderful...the view is spectacular. The deck is the best part of this property. This isn't a high tech property so don't expect to show up and connect to wifi or find fancy electronics. BUT, Marlena has everything you can think of to make your stay cozy and comfy; a FULL kitchen, washer dryer, endless games, DVDs, a stereo, BBQ (both electric & charcoal)... You should be prepared to hang out. There isn't very many close options for food or entertainment. That isn't what this place is. We ventured out for one meal during our 5 day stay. Everything is at least 20-30 mins away down an incredibly windy road.
Our only issues were minor...
- I had a hard time getting the grill lit (the starter didn't work but I eventually was able to get it using matches)
- The couch is not the best for sleeping. We had a one couple and 2 singles, so one person slept on the couch.
Overall, it's a great place to recharge and connect with loved ones. The property is remote and just lovely."

Stayed a few nights","We had such an amazing weekend at Summerset. The house was so cute and comfortable, and had all the supplies we could've asked for. It's very secluded, so be sure to stock up with all the food you'll need before you get there. Then walk in the door, turn off your phone, and forget about the rest of the world for a couple days.
The main attraction here is the view, and it does not disappoint. Gorgeous during the day, and absolutely breathtaking at night. Lots of great seating for enjoying the view, and a fun collection of board games, DVDs, and CDs for when you feel like you should do something else for a bit. Bed was comfy, appliances worked well, shower was great, coffee bean grinder was provided, checkin/out was a no-brainer... None of the little missteps that Airbnbs often make.
Although we didn't see her once, Marlena was incredibly helpful and responsive. Highest possible marks all around. Really, a magical experience."

This is the perfect place for someone trying to enjoy sunsets while drinking a glass of wine. Waking up in a quiet environment was unbelievable. Hearing the sounds of birds as you wake up was priceless. At night, we got to see a beautiful sky full of stars. Perfect romantic weekend getaway to take your loved ones.
Marlena did an excellent job communicating with us and asking if we needed anything. As she says in the description, once you get there you won't want to leave the house.
I would definitely recommend this place to anybody who wishes to relax and enjoy wonderful views of the lake."

While the location is a little remote, which will takes 10 more minutes driving on a winding road, so better to grab everything you need with you and just stay the whole time inside. There is no WiFi, so we had chances to watch many dvds, though most are old movies but very classic. The most exciting part during the stay was that Marlena allowed us to flight the drone, and with the aerial view we can find what a great location it is. Highly recommend everyone come and enjoy the tranquil experience."

We didn't plan so well coming in as the drive to Marlena's place was long for us (first trip with an infant). We only picked up a few groceries so when Marlena asked if we wanted anything in town on our second day, we asked her to pick up a Safeway order for us and she gladly did! She's a great communicator and was very helpful during our stay. We enjoyed all of the little touches like the logs left out for us for the fireplace, the self-care packets left for us, the bottle of wine, the high quality shampoo/conditioner.

Stayed a few nights","Summerset is hands down one of my top three favorite AirBnb stays. Five stars across the board for this wonderful and very special home. The view on the deck is absolutely stunning (even better than the pictures). It is indescribable and will literally TAKE YOUR BREATH AWAY once you step onto that deck. The interior of the home is also VERY, VERY CHARMING! Again...much better than what the camera can capture. If you want to reset and recharge this home is the PERFECT place to achieve this goal. I also completely agree with many of the reviewers when they say that once you are at the home, you will NOT want to leave because the view is addicting. The only thing that I think surpasses this home is the host, Marlena. She is probably the MOST GRACIOUS and most accommodating host I have interacted with. She will go out of her way to ensure that you have a restful and stress-free stay. She gave us passes to an amazing local winery and bought us delicious desserts! And...communicating with her was a breeze! Her response time is impeccable! The essence of Summerset (both inside and out) is a true reflection of Marlena's human spirit. We will definitely be returning..."

Stayed a few nights","Summerset is not your normal everyday vacation rental. It is a unique house with art and a color-coordinated scheme that offers the feeling of being comfortable and at home. There are lots of interesting things to look at, including dried thrush grass enclosed in glass next to the front door. There are views out of every window. It is an older house but doesn't feel like it.
The master bedroom has a soaking tub surrounded by unique tile which simply isn't seen in this era of generic tile from Lowes or Home Depot. There are nice touches in the bathroom like quality lotion, bath salts and shampoo. And although the second bedroom had its own bathroom, the master bath is also accessible from the living room so that people staying in the other bathroom can access the tub without going through the master bedroom. That's handy if you have more than one or two people who prefer a soaking tub than a shower.
The deck is an outdoor room by itself with many views - there are chairs and other outdoor furniture facing east, south, west and north so you can sit wherever the sun is. It is totally quiet, except for many species of birds that make the area their home. If you're a birder this is an ideal house because it's where the land meets the water so there's two different habitats next door to each other.
Marlena, herself, is a wonderful and caring host who doesn't intrude, and mainly communicates through the airbnb app. On the last full day of my visit, she brought some duraflame logs for the fireplace, but I spent most of my time out on the deck until it got dark, then it was a bath and bed for me.

The only thing to caution is that the road in is narrow and winding. I was tired and drove really slow, but luckily, there were no locals behind me for me to annoy with my slow speed.

I flew in to Sacramento, stopped at the Walmart in Woodland (just off of I-5) and bought a small cooler, then drove through Woodland and bought groceries at Raleys. That was a good solution rather than going into Clearlake for groceries after the long drive."

We stayed at Summerset with two infants and a dog and was very enjoyable and relaxing. The attention to detail was impeccable and very clean. We were impressed by how well stocked and equiped the kitchen was!

Stayed a few nights","We had a wonderful, peaceful getaway at Summerset. The first thing that we noticed when getting out of the car after a long drive was how stunningly quiet the area is and how awesome the view from the deck was. The entire place, inside and outside, was kept very clean. We were a little worried about not having Wifi (*laughs nervously*), but there was plenty to do between watching the varied DVD collection, board games, yoga, cooking, and just relaxing. We also cheated a bit and streamed a couple of shows through our mobile phones.
Marlena is an awesome host who texted us once in a while to check in but otherwise left us to enjoy our quiet stay. She also left us a few extras like chocolates, wine, and fuzzy socks, which we really appreciated.
As Marlena and others have mentioned, we definitely recommend bringing your own food and groceries because you will not want to leave the place once you are there. We were able to cook and store all of our meals in the full-sized kitchen.
We would definitely recommend this stay if you are looking for a quiet and relaxing getaway!"

The deck provides a great platform for relaxing and enjoying the unobstructed lake view. A very pleasant surprise was how many birds there were. We spent hours watching all kinds of birds including two bald eagles catching and eating fish.

We spent an entire day just relaxing on the deck, soaking-in the wonderful views. There are numerous seating areas around the house, so you can have morning coffee facing east and afternoon wine watching the sun set. The kitchen is stocked with every cooking utensil one can imagine, including a whole array of spices and condiments.
Just bring groceries, beverages and settle-in!"

Stayed with kids","Beautiful escape! My sisters and I brought my mom her for 60th birthday. It is high up in the mountain, not right on the water. Almost 360° of water and Mountain Views. We enjoyed choosing a movie from her expansive selection each night, did yoga on the deck every morning, visited Brassfield winery (HIGHLY recommend!), played cards and explored the towns around the lake. I brought my 8mo old crawling baby and the house was fairly baby proof, but there is a small gap at the bottom of the deck railings so we just had to watch him closely to keep him away from any edges."

We spent three relaxing nights here and were sad to leave. The house is exactly how it’s been advertised - very charming, low tech no tech, but you will have everything you need and more. The views from the back porch are breathtaking and you probably will spend hours just sitting there and taking mental pictures. Definitely one of the places on my list to visit again.
Thank you Marlena for making us feel welcomed."

Plan for sleeping, reading and taking in all the sights. Nostalgic selection of DVDs to finish off the night. Hope to be back to enjoy the view again. Already miss it."

How long has it been since seeing plentiful stars and a planet or two in the Bay Area sky?
We came fully stocked, and never left after arriving. The house has everything you could need and reveals many special features. Loved the little inspirational sayings.

Complete and true silence, only pure nature. Such an accommodating place. Marlena truly has a touch for thinking and providing everything you could possibly need and beyond. We did grocery shopping prior to arriving, as suggested, but Marlena would still check in on us any time she was in town to make sure we weren’t missing anything; completely amazing!
We truly did not want to leave, we absolutely enjoyed it to the last minute. We could not be happier or more relaxed after our stay here and cannot wait until we can get away and come back."

I booked this location for a friend’s bachelorette weekend, and it was gorgeous. I didn’t know 2 of the girls who came, but the location was so cozy and pretty that it really encouraged conversation and relaxation. There’s a stargazing, too! There’s a telescope, for those interested in the stars. One thing to note—this is not a swimming lake. Boating, yes, swimming, no. I would highly recommend this location. I went in the summer, but I’m interested to see what a winter trip would be like (there’s a beautiful fireplace we didn’t get a chance to use). The beds are so fluffy! I really can’t recommend this place enough."

We LOVE that at the evening time we can hang out on the deck at the perfect Summer temperature enjoying the view WITHOUT mosquitos or bugs!! My baby kept on waking up in the middle of night where I had to take her out to the deck, and me face up laying on the sofa on the deck with my baby sleeping on my chest and looking into the sky full of stars was surreal...
This place is a little paradise! And the host is extremely welcome and responsive. She even offered to pick up something when she was in town. Thank you so much for your hard work to keep such a nice place available for us to enjoy!"

Stayed with kids","We really enjoyed the calmness of Marlena's home. It was clean, inviting, and was stocked with many things that made it easier for us - basic spices and cooking supplies, toiletries, and grill accessories. The deck was wonderful and it was very relaxing to spend the warm afternoons and cool evenings. Very quiet and private. There is a winding road just below the deck (about 30 feet below) that seldom had cars driving through it so it didn't bother us. The heat was a little dry so if you're sensitive to that, bring a small humidifier to ease breathing. The heat made us crave some water time - wish there was a pool. There is no lake access from the home in case you were hoping to take a dip in the lake, you'd have to go to a public beach for water access. We brought our 17-month old and had to bring our own high chair and crib, so bring yours in case you are travelling with little ones. We hope to come back in the future."

The views can’t be beat. It’s peaceful and quiet. There’s a comfortable, well stocked, and loving touches throughout the entire house. It’s tucked away in the middle of a mountain, so while you’re not on the water, the view makes up for it.
The host, Marlena, is warm and inviting. She even checked in with us at one point to see if we wanted her to pick up anything for us while she was at the store.

I especially loved how she welcomed my fur baby! She left him bowls to enjoy his food and water, flashlights to take him out for his walk and poopie bags.
In addition, we were welcomed by a personalized note and goodies! What a great getaway from city life. Surely a digital detox. There were a lot of books to read, games and cds/records!

One of the reasons i booked this place is because of the “rare privacy” however that was not the case. The owner was actually staying feet away in her cottage. I wish we would have known because we wouldn’t have booked.
Another reason we booked was the jacuzzi spa tub pictured over looking the lake, it didn’t work. The knobs were removed so you couldn’t turn the jets on.
There were chewed up sunflower seeds on my night stand in the bedroom and all over the deck. In the rules it asked for shoes not to we worn inside so i didn’t and within 20 minutes my feet were black from the dirty floors.
Last but not least i found her to be very rude in the messages she sent during my stay.

You don't have to bring a lot since there is a ton of books, movies, and games in the house (bring chromecast if you want to watch Netflix). My favorite part is the deck! It is massive and the view is surreal! We spent most of our time on the deck simply just taking it all in (also drinking cocktails, stargazing, and birdwatching). We even saw a small plane flying over the water which was so cool. We will definitely stay at Marlena's place again in the future. My family and doggies had an awesome time.

My partner and I (and our dog) stayed here for my birthday trip – this is a great place for peacefulness, reflection, and quality time with yourself & your company. Thank you Marlena for making your place available during COVID (and following the protocol) — we felt safe and refreshed after the trip."

Stayed with kids","We love our stay here. Like all others suggested, we spent all our time here and never leave during our stay. We're lucky that we got perfect weather so spent almost all our day time on the deck (and some night time too because it's a great spot to see the stars). To me the highlights is morning yoga on the deck while watching sparking sunshine over the lake and for the kids, they love the swing and bird houses in side yard. But generally, doing nothing and just staring at the sky, mountains, lake and hearing bird singing is priceless and worthwhile every second."

Stayed with kids","This is the perfect location for family vacation for those with a loved one on the autism spectrum. It is very difficult to take our son to places without bringing along a kit full of his favorite items that help him to cope with unfamiliar situation and sensory overload. For those people who can’t put up with strong colors and potent smells, this place is perfect. The walls are painted in airy neutral colors, the lighting is very soft and warm, and all the soaps and detergents are unscented or have light natural scents. Around the home there are also different amenities to help people on the spectrum self-soothe. A tree swing hangs outside the house. If you are looking for a sensory friendly place to travel this place is amazing!"

The whole time we were there, all we did was just stare out into the lake from the living room. It felt unreal and serene. Also at night, the sky is full of stars! Such a great experience. The house was very cozy and clean and had such a nice vibe to it as well. Our host Marlena was also one of the nicest and best hosts we've had! She was incredibly thoughtful and kind. We will definitely be coming back here again! Thanks for everything Marlena!"

Stayed with kids","Summerset is a great getaway from the busy city life. We spent 5 days here and felt it was less. The house itself is very tastefully done with all safety and cleanliness procedures adhered to. Marlena was prompt in replying for anything we needed. While we didn't get to meet her (due to COVID), she was always available through text message on the app. The kitchen is stocked with all the possible cookware and basic items like spices and oils. The appliances work very well so one can cook a full blown meal. We cooked all meals at home. Tip: There is a Safeway about 15 minutes away at Olympic Dr. from where one can source all the groceries. Best to stock up before driving up to the house as you will not want to leave the house. The bedrooms are cute and bathrooms are clean. The deck is amazing and on a sunny day, one can laze outside and sip on some champagne. Overall, we loved Summerset and can't thank Marlena enough."

The views from the deck are mind blowing and we loved the ultra comfortable deck seating, especially for some spectacular stargazing. The house itself if cozy and Marlena has been very thoughtful in setting it up and making people feel comfortable.
In addition to making us feel welcome, Marlena made our stay very memorable. She’s one of the nicest people we’ve come across on our travels and she went out of the way to FedEx something we left behind.
Absolutely recommend this amazing place and we’ll definitely be coming here again!"

It's secluded, cozy, has the most amazing 180 views of the lake, and has every amenity you need to unplug and unwind. The host was so friendly and helpful, but also gave us our space and privacy. During the day, I relaxed for hours on the deck reading my book and taking in the crisp air, the serene lake, and the chirping birds. At night, we made delicious dinners, lit the fireplace, listened to music and watched old movies. For a week, I was able to escape the clutter and stress of every day life, and I definitely plan to go back again in the future!"

Stayed with kids",This place is truly a gem. It’s the best Airbnb we’ve ever stayed at and the experience was made even more special thanks to Marlena. We came here for my wife’s birthday and she found a card and a gift waiting for her when we entered the house! We then went into the living room and the view of the lake is just spectacular. The same thing with the bedroom where we woke up every day to a view of the lake and hills from our bed. There’s no WiFi or cable so we spent time without any devices and playing board games and relaxing. Drinking tea on the deck while watching the sunset was also great. Marlena was quick to respond whenever we had any questions. She also left a game of scrabble and movie snacks for us the night before we left for home. I highly recommend staying here. I think we might just come here regularly whenever we want to unplug and relax.

Stayed a few nights","Marlena is a truly wonderful host. She was very welcoming and thoughtful, clearly always considering our comfort during our stay at her place. She even offered to get us pizza and wine to be ready when we arrived!!
I’ve been to many very nice AIrBnbs but this is truly the best of all. The views of this house are hard to describe— much better in person than the photos. It is so nice that the house is designed such that all rooms in the house have the view. The expansive deck is really amazing and so lovely. The cute side garden with all the bird feeders attracts so many adorable little birds and I greatly enjoyed watching them and listening to them. The place is very private which is really fantastic. I believe Marlena stays in the small cottage next door, but we wouldn’t have known if we hadn’t seen a car parked outside. So she fully respects her guests privacy. The house was immaculately clean and had everything we needed. Basically it was as if we were in our own home with all the kitchen equipment and anything you could imagine available. There are so many games, DVDs and CDs to enjoy, and also an awesome collection of books and magazines. As the posting has noted there is no internet, so this is a great opportunity to unplug and just relax and enjoy the beautiful nature in these serene and lovely place. Highly recommended and will definitely stay here again if we come back to the area."

We spent part of each day just relaxing on the deck, looking out over the water. Maybe the most unexpected and special part of our stay, though, was the thoughtful communication from Marlena. We were staying there for our honeymoon, and she welcomed us with a sweet message and bottle of wine. She was available to us via text for anything and everything (including getting us a few lemons for a meal we were making), but also made sure to give us the utmost privacy. Thank you, Marlena!

I mean that honestly, the huge fireplthe beautiful deck that opened windows looking at the mountains and the lake, the private dog to fish, the Jacuzzi off the master bedroom all the extra. Blanky's when it's well equipped kitchen and my Jew. I'm a chef. I didn't have to bring anything with me this time. Except for this house so much. My children are grown, but they're young adults and they absolutely love that house. It was hailing and a storm came. We lit the fireplace and played family ate good. We slept good for my 53rd birthday. It was absolutely amazing. I suggest if this house is available. And you're looking for family fun, peace and quiet. In an absolutely beautiful home. The downstairs which has a spiraling staircase. My daughter's love that room. This was our second time staying there. I cannot reiterate how amazing this house is.Thank you again victor"

I met 3 of them in my short stay and they were very kind and welcoming!
A bonus? Right out the backdoor is a water way with several native birds. We saw about 75 pelicans just floating off the back deck daily - must be their routine! The outdoor area is just as amazing as the home with comfy places to sit, a warm fireplace and the beauty of nature!

However, we felt that there was a need for better support, as the accommodation lacked basic items such as paper towels, gas for the barbecue, and gas for the firetip.

There are a double sit atop kayak and peddle boats to use. The dock is in the keys amidst other homes, but it’s only about a 10-15 minute paddle to the full lake. Really nice fall colors in the lake and nearby hills in November.
The kitchen was well stocked. It was nice having a washer and dryer.
There are some nice walks in the area, although note that many (not all) prohibit dogs. We had no issues walking our dog around the neighborhood. There are a lot of outdoor cats that live in the neighborhood; this was fine for our dog but just a note to dog owners.
We had fun off-roading on walker ridge road. Plenty of fishing and hunting in the area if that is your thing. Overall a ton of outdoor options.
Host was very communicative and had prepared a helpful binder with recommendations etc that was nice to have."

but he couldn't make it. However he did show up first thing next morning and walla, it works. I'm better off staying away from I.T. things. Her location in the ""Keys"" is easy to find and has quick access to open fast water. Daniele was great!"

We were able to take our paddle board on the water too. The kitchen was well equipped. The exhaust fan was not working but it was supposed to be fixed soon. The only issue we faced is that the bunk beds were a bit squeaky which disturbed our sleep. There were guests in the adjacent place who were very nice, but we could hear them in the patio area."

Stayed with kids","We booked our ""End of Summer"" family trip at the lake house in Clearlake Oaks. We had never been to Clearlake before. The lake house was perfect for Me, my husband and three children. It was stocked with everything you need. There was plenty of games to enjoy together. There was scooters that my children enjoyed riding in the nice little quiet neighborhood. The kitchen was nicely stocked with everything you need for cooking. The lake itself was not impressive and smelly, not good to swim in. But I've now learned it's been like that for years, and you have to drive to the nice spots. We had a blast at the lake house, enjoying each others company and just spending quality time together. We will be back, FOR SURE!"

In fact, We had a minor boating incident and Daniele happened to check in on us. She was concerned for our safety and didn’t stop communicating until we were home safe!
The house fit six people perfectly. All the amenities are there including a map of the are. The house is really cute and very clean. The lake is low, so there are very few places you can put your boat in. Her place is a five minute drive to the nearest launching area. Plenty of parking. She texted me when the place was ready for an early check in! Who does that?! Daniele that’s who!
We enjoyed our stay and will be back. ❤️"

The house was very clean, cozy and had everything to make one feel at home. When we arrived at 9:30PM I was wondering how to get in as I totally forgot Daniele had given the door entry code through airbnb 3 days before our stay; I messaged Daniele on how to get in and she immediately responded with the code again, and also opened the door for us remotely. My kid enjoyed the bunk bed. Paddle boating was a family fun activity and as an added bonus we got a good view of the July 4th fireworks 🎆. Thank you Daniele for making our stay so memorable and we are looking forward to staying again."

We came up for a Father's day fishing trip plus work from home getaway. My husband caught 10 fish off of the dock in back! I had a great time taking calls in front of the fire pit and doing my crosswords in the sun in the afternoons. The best week we've had thus far for sure. Daniele was super responsive and was quick to answer all of our questions (and help out when I accidentally locked myself out of the house, smh). If you're looking for a peaceful getaway or want to work from home somewhere else, this is the place to go!"

Group trip","Pros:
This is a great location. Right onto the lake from the house. The living spaces (kitchen, living room, bathroom) were clean.
Dani was quick in her responses.
Unfortunately, I had to leave very quickly. After arriving at 8pm on a Sunday night to check in, I started to have slight sneezing, runny nose, watery eyes, sinus's, itchy/irritated throat. This was in the master bedroom with half bath. I have allergies to dust, mold, mites I woke up several times in the night, and finally I woke up at 7am with wheezing. The wheezing is a severe reaction for me towards mold. I sent a message to Dani right away. She responded immediately and agreed to a refund for the rest of the nights. We left before 11am on Monday.
A few things to mention:
1. The stench in the room with the double bed was terrible, unbearable. No one could sleep in it. My mother in law slept on the futon in the living room.
2. There was no bath mat in the main bathroom we used a small towel.
3. The back patio furniture (seating area & tables) was filled with dust. I tried dusting it off & my allergies kicked in.
4. The water down the dock is surrounded by muck/mulch/algae.
5. The paddle boat is filled with green water & blocked by the muck in the water.
There was no way I would've been able to paddle boat out of kayak out without clearing out the green muck on the lake.
6. There is a washer/dryer and water heater/water tank in the master bedroom. If you are a light sleeper, the water tank makes noise every time you flush the toilet.
7. The carpet was supposed to be shampooed and the shampoo process was started and a note was left stating, ""I started shampooing and stopped. I didn't realize anyone was coming."" I appreciated not checking into a wet carpet situation, but perhaps maybe that could've contributed to the allergies as well."

We ended up checking in late so the fact that check was super easy was helpful at the late hour. Daniele stayed in touch and made sure we were comfortable.
The kitchen is well stocked both in terms of utensils and basics needed for cooking a meal. Kids enjoyed playing several board games that is in the guest bedroom. Beds were comfy and the room cozy for a great night’s sleep. The deck is great for grilling or just hanging out.
We didn’t use the kayak but kids also enjoyed the paddle boat around the keys. Overall a great short trip and an excellent host. Would love to do it again if our visits bring us to Clearlake. Thank you Daniele for the awesome experience!!"

What was special were the paddle boat ride where you’d see different bird species. For the night time, stargazing is excellent. If you have a telescope, you should bring it!
Just a note on a couple of things:
1. The host is not sure about the potability of the water for drinking. You could buy bottled water at the store, or you could boil it, too. They had an electric kettle.
2. The lighting in the dining and living room were quite dim. It was too dark to be able to play board games properly. Maybe not so bad if you were just drinking.

We stayed for a weekend when the temp > 100. But air-conditioning is very good that we wouldn't even feel hot inside the house. I 100% recommend this house in Clearlake.

Stayed a few nights",The lake house was perfect for us. Very clean and Dany was very easy to get in contact with the whole time before and during the stay there. Would definitely stay again when in the area.
