Stayed a few nights","Jennifer's place was amazing!!
The house and grounds are stunning and very well cared for - we will definitely come back in warmer weather to enjoy the deck.
There were a few minor issues (some missing batteries, etc), but Jennifer was proactive in checking in with us and fixed the issues immediately.
The driveway is a little hidden, but with Jennifer's precise directions, we found it without any problems.
Our only complaint is that the wifi was really weak, so if you plan to work while there, it might be an issue."

Kitchen over looks family room, which flows out to Deck (large deck) great space to cook and be apart of everyone's visit. Plenty of Parking up top. Easy access to main road into town. downtown only 5 minutes away.

Stayed a few nights",This is a beautiful place and quite relaxing. we were close to city yet far enough away that gave it an almost magical nuance. I would definitely recommend the Heron house. we loved the grounds and the pond is great to sit by. we saw Heron on the pond. The deck was great to enjoy breakfast and coffee and watch the sunrise as well as the sunsets we'd see the Heron fly in over the pond.

The house was very easy to find thanks to Jennifer’s instructions! she was also very kind enough to let us bring our 3rd dog at the last minute and it was great there was lots of room the dogs loved it just as much as we did! The town is a short drive away and has some really great eateries! I absolutely have fallen in love with Oregon thanks to this trip and the lovely time I had at Jennifer’s place.

Stayed about a week","Nice home adjacent to cannabis farm in Fort Vannoy area of GP. Beautiful sunsets, excellent appliances and basic necessities provided. Host was excellent at communication. Note, this is attached to another AirBNB unit with constant turnover and laundry area is shared. Also, the Wi-Fi is painfully slow and working remotely was impossible. Verizon coverage is also sketchy in this area and typically at 3 bars. Bring your bug spray and citronella! With the location in the farm area of GP with a “pond “ on property, summer bugs are brutal."

It’s located just outside of Grants Pass, but it was easy to zip into town to pick up groceries or gas. The house was well stocked with shampoo & conditioner & body wash, and there were kcups for the Keurig. This was a solid five star experience for us! Thanks!"

The place is cozy and Jennifer and Serena have included all the nice touches of a great host - nice soft sheets on the beds, toiletries in the bathrooms, and small appliances in the kitchen so that you can really make yourself at home. And the place is also decorated very nicely. It's also peaceful and quiet - just far enough from town, but still close enough to make going downtown just a quick trip in the car. My family hope we can stay there again soon. I'd highly recommend this place."

The rainy weekend made for perfect nights, sitting in the hot tub and enjoying some wine. The only issues I had were; the see-through sheet was an interesting choice for the bathroom door and, the cover to the front porch is not weatherized at all. Everywhere under the covering, save a few inches from the door was soaked any time it rained.
Incredibly thankful for the opportunity to use the space!"

Absolutely loved enjoying a glass of wine while watching the sunset from the lovely deck (with a visit from their beautiful kitty), then sitting in the hot tub at dawn watching the sunrise with a visit from deer and a wild turkey. Rare to find a place where you can enjoy both. The main road is very close (but you can’t see it), and we did have a few louder cars in the night, but we both noticed it’s a pretty quiet road. My husband is a pretty big guy so he felt a little tight in the loft - he couldn’t really sit up, but it’s an amazing space. Very thoughtful design and layout. Love the natural forest setting with wildflowers blooming."

Stayed a few nights","Traveling the world and staying in countless air bnb’s, I have developed unreasonably high standards. That being said, I give this tiny home my utmost regard. The area was stunning, it’s hard to find something more relaxing than sitting in a hot tub in the woods and looking up at the stars. While it felt like the perfect amount of isolation, I was still close enough to the town to shop at the stores. I used their bbq every night to make dinner. There is also a kitchen fully stocked with all cooking supplies. I couldn’t have found a better place to stay, and it doesn’t surprise me that I was unable to extend my stay. If you have the opportunity to book, I would do it immediately before someone else beats you to it."

I wasn’t able to enjoy the hot tub since I had checked in so late at night, but when I arrived I was pleasantly surprised and happy to see I was greeted with a bottle of wine and supplies for roasting marshmallows. There’s nothing I would change about this beautiful tiny home and the host was nothing but gracious and kind. The pricing was extremely fair and to anyone looking for a romantic getaway or just a nice peaceful stay away, this is the perfect place. It’s Just far enough from the heart of grants pass So that you are close enough to go in town no problem but it feels like you’re out in the wilderness and secluded. I would rate more than five stars if I could."

Stayed with a pet","Very cute tiny home, private and peaceful. The AC kept it nice and cool inside. The amenities are also nice like the hot tub and a couple bottles of wine. The couple of downsides I would say is that the bathroom is not private at all. There’s only a curtain that’s serving as a door, so be sure you’re very comfortable with who you’re staying with. Lastly, the photos are not updated with how the landscaping is now. I thought there would be big open space around the property but there was lots of weeds, stickers, and burs. Thus, nowhere that was comfortable for my dog to go potty. Overall it was a very nice stay and if you’d like a getaway that’s away from the city, this would be a great escape. :)"

The views are great and super close to downtown restaurants where all the food is delicious. The entry way is easy to spot and is now a paved road instead of gravel which is great! The spot has AC which was also so nice since it’s been a hot August in Oregon. The place is well equipped with stuff to cook including a microwave for easy re-heating and a grill outside. The couch is comfy and so are the sheets for the bed. 10/10 would recommend.

At the same time, it’s next to their main house so I felt safe and not scared. The lights on the deck were lovely, the hot tub was nice and clean, and the electric fire pit was awesome! The s’mores stuff and bottle of wine was a generous touch ❤️"

The host sent a welcome message promising a bottle of wine, candies, everything you'll need to fix smores. But the roasting sticks were dirty, couldn't lit a fire without propane, no candies were found and no bottle of wine either.
I would warn anyone over 5'7"" as you might bump your head entering the bathroom. A cute sign could be so helpful!"

There were so many amazing small touches such as the wine & smores kit, happy birthday messages, and the custom tour guide book on top the entertainment stand. We loved the area and the privacy of the tiny home. The tiny home was so peaceful and homey that our dog was able to rest peacefully. :) We will definitely be returning to this tiny home anytime we are in the area. Thank you Mason and Shelby."

The hot tub was nice to soak in when we checked in to the property after a long drive, and we were able to utilize the gas fireplace outside as well to have a nice end of our night. Thank you guys for being great hosts! We will definitely be back since this is only 3 hours away from us on the coast."

Hot tub ready to go, heat on, even water in the Keurig! When we had questions about some of the amenities, their responses were always quick and helpful. We will definitely be back! I am sure during other seasons it is beautiful in other ways! I have stayed in a lot of airbnbs, some really bad and some great, and this is the best one I’ve stayed in!

From the spacious size and comfy bed to the thoughtful snacks after a long day of travel and great coffee to enjoy with a light breakfast in cozy chairs, we couldn’t have asked for more. Our only regret was not having enough time to enjoy the gorgeous steam shower or outdoor fire pit. The bathroom truly is a work of art. Will definitely book again if we return to the area. Thank you Guy!"

It was extremely clean! The washer and dryer were so nice to have. The kitchen has basic cooking tools and some herbs and seasonings. The beds were fairly comfortable. It was a short stay, as we were just passing through, but met the needs of the four of us quite well! It had a cute, nicely landscaped courtyard that the cabins all faced. Check in and check out were super easy! It’s an awesome location , with easy access to lots of awesome outdoor recreation opportunities!"

This was the perfect location--the room was clean and looks as advertised in the photos, the AC unit worked well in the heat, and the water pressure in the shower was good. Parking was easy to find in front of the units as well as on the street next to them. One thing to note was that a lot of restaurants closed around 8pm to 9pm, so if you arrive later in the evening it may be tougher to find something to eat. Definitely would come back!"

Stayed with kids","A beautiful house perfect for a family. Sometimes Airbnbs look like they've been thrown together by an IKEA catalogue, but this actually looked and felt like home- everything was pristine and comfortable. The yard was great for the kids to run around in. The beds were perfect- oh so comfortable. Rooms were perfect in size and comfort. Everything was perfectly clean and the neighborhood was quiet.
Everything is drive-able distance.
We also followed several of Tyler's recommendations and they did not disappoint!
Also, sometimes AirBnbs say, ""thanks for staying- now do 30 million things before you leave"". Tyler asked us to strip the beds, lock the doors, start a load of towels and dishes, take out the trash, and we're out. So nice not to have to do a million things before hauling our family out.
I would definitely recommend."

Have never stayed at an AirBnb that included more necessities for your stay, cleaning, cooking etc. lots of cozy blankets. Great outdoor seating. We even had a campfire with supplied wood.
Tyler was responsive, home was located near everything we needed (Grants Pass isn’t really a walking town-I expect most renters will have a vehicle)
Beds were great. Showers too. Only small thing I would suggest is how nice it would be to have a bbq available to use. Thanks Tyler! We will definitely look for this listing when we return!"

The backyard is so spacious and the perfect space for relaxing. We kept saying much we wished it was our home!
The location is great. The home is in a safe neighborhood and is close to grocery stores and restaurants.
Above all else, Tyler was the BEST host!! He was very responsive from the time of booking until we checked out. He was so nice and helpful with any questions we had.

Group trip","Thank you, Tyler for a wonderful and comfortable stay at your house! What you see is what you get, our expectations were high based on photos shown on listing, house met all our expectations and then some! The overall vibe of the place was a home away from home! The entire house was spotlessly clean and we were able to make use of the well appointed kitchen to prepare all our meals and the dining table was a sufficient size and central to our gathering! We appreciated the open spaced layout of the house because it allowed us to talk to each other whether we were in the kitchen, the dining table or the sofa/sectional!
The bedrooms were cozy, the mattresses and pillows were so comfortable! I brought my own pillow but never brought it out of my car because the pillows in the room I slept in was the right height and feel! The bathrooms too were clean with great water pressure from the showers. If we were to return for another family reunion, we would definitely want to stay here again!"

We had 5 adults, 1 child, and 1 infant and we had plenty of space. The home looked exactly like the photos depicted and was super clean upon arrival. We cooked often at the house and it had all the appliances needed.
The backyard was great. Plenty of space to throw the ball around and the fire pit was great. The location was great! Plenty of grocery stores and restaurants nearby. Easy 10pm drive to downtown to stores and restaurants! Also easy to get to other towns to go to places like the Wildlife Safari and Crater Lake.

Stayed with kids",We had a nice time. We wish that we could have stayed longer. We were on a road trip.We didn’t get to enjoy it as long as we would’ve liked to.We would stay there again if we come back that way. It is close enough to places to walk to. They left you a book with places to eat that were close.Thank you for letting us stay.😊

The kitchen had almost everything you needed...could use a pot to brew tea :} The bathroom was small, but each bedroom had a chair and tables to set things on so that was not a problem. Everything worked well and the place was spotless. The beds were comfy except one was a bit on the hard side and I would recommend putting a cushioned mattress cover on it. It is in a quiet neighborhood and except for a few dogs barking periodically until 10 pm, it was very peaceful.
The owners were very communicative and sent messages to welcome us and make sure all was going well.
Thank you T and Cameron for a lovely stay."

There were fresh flowers on the table and in the kitchen, which was so sweet to see when we walked in. Just as advertised in pictures and descriptions. Super cozy and inviting. We have never stayed in such a cool retro place before. This Airbnb quickly stood out to us because of how fun and unique it was. From the furnishings and finishes, to the record player and even the Werther’s hard candies in a crystal dish, to the retro cookbooks..each and every touch was so well designed and thought out to stay in the retro vibe. We enjoyed the games there and listened to lots of music on the record player. This home was fully equipped with everything our family needed during our stay and fun things like books and puzzles for the kids. Location was great, just a close walk or drive to downtown and nearby restaurants and in a nice area. We will be back for sure and highly recommend! 10/10!"

The basketball hoop in the arcade was broken, the air hockey didn’t properly work, and the fuse table was super wobbly also. Couldn’t access the internet in the game room either. The switch controllers were also not charged. Overall I think the location looks cute but needs massive upgrades and upkeep. Place was clean, cute, and overall has a lot of potential."

The place is small like the description says but you don’t feel on top of each other. There are TWO bedrooms plus the upper den I thought there was only one so that was a great extra surprise. Would totally recommend for a friends trip or trip with the family (like we did). The games room can be cold so bring extra layers. There isn’t much to do in grants pass but we were there for the airbnb itself rather than the location!

Stayed with a pet","This home has bright glowing energy! It’s giving all the warm & cozy memory vibes. The game room offered up hours of pure joy and laughter for the whole family. The interior of the home is warm and welcoming, we were especially fond of the huge island in the Kitchen! The esthetic of the house could use a few upgrades, but it seems appropriate for a family vacay. I personally would have enjoyed a nice area rug and upgraded cooking pans and utensils. The interior gives IKEA kinda vibes but it’s just fine for a family trip. If you’re a holistic foodie and are trying to avoid PFAS I recommend bringing your own stuff. Moving on to the exterior of the abode, the patio space was by far our favorite spot of the property. Really thoughtfully done. Whoever did the concrete and landscape, Bravo! Loved the gas fire pit, putting green, B-ball, and the hot tub was the cherry on top! Really can’t stop bragging about this place! We absolutely will be back next time we’re in the area."

Stayed with kids","Our family of five had a wonderful stay and the kids were in heaven with the game room and hot tub. Hot tub seemed very clean and was placed in the perfect location being able to view the outdoor tv/fire pit from it.The game room was amazing and the reason for staying. Location was good neighborhood and easy access to many things. Just know that many of the games didn’t fully work (such as basketball game and air hockey). And steering wheel on the race car game was broken off. The golf area was unusable when we stayed due to the over abundance of squished plums on the green (from tree in yard)… which also might explain the sticky floors in both the house and game room. Bathroom door was broken and unable to shut all the way. And bathroom faucet was loose/leaked, but bathroom/shower was clean. Bed in 2nd room was placed rather high off ground and was hard for our young boys to get in and out (would guess hard for elderly also). Overall, we do recommend this stay and plan on returning!"

I’d say we got out of it what we hoped for. We had a few issues during our stay but we brought them to Thomas’s attention and he said we would get them corrected immediately. Overall we really enjoyed our stay here and the views of the mountains all around you are absolutely gorgeous! The only thing that would make this Bnb better is if it were more secluded. It’s also only a few hours from Crater lake which is absolutely gorgeous! There is a Walmart and other known grocery stores inside of Grants pass which is also extremely convenient.

We fell in love with the pictures and knew it would be perfect for our little ones to appreciate too. Needless to say. It was BEYOND perfect. We spent all day playing and making memories. Thank you so much for having us!

Stayed a few nights","Such a sweet spot! This place is really well designed for fun - certainly with all the fun games and amenities, but even in the little touches, like the large doors that open to the outside and the speakers positioned throughout the house. It makes a great getaway for both kids and adults. We just went with another couple, our good friends, and had a great time unwinding here.
We found the house to be very clean and well designed. Beds and couches and such were very comfortable. The property is set in a nice and peaceful neighborhood, with neighbors that we were really friendly when they walked by, or we walked by them. There were a handful of spots you could walk to quickly (15 mins) and many more in the nearby downtown area. Grants Pass provided plenty by way of good views, good food, and good excursions.
In short, we had an awesome stay and hope to return sometime!"

The house is very well kept and clean. We had a lot of fun from all of the games the backyard had to offer and those inside the 2nd half of the house.
I couldn't help but take pictures and share our stay with others interested in something totally different! The plum tree had some amazing fruit on it during our visit, which was a really nice touch.
I highly recommend checking it out. It really is just as cool as the pictures 😁"

Stayed a few nights","great place, lots to do! we had a great time, however, we had to clean the bathroom, game room, and kitchen appliances more thoroughly upon arrival due to stickiness and stains and old food. We did look around for a book/binder with instructions for the hot tub and grill and cleaning instructions but found nothing and had very little information on how to leave the place when checking out. The gas for the grill was very difficult to get going and never got above 350 and one side didn't work at all. This place is great for a short stay but we wished the maintenance and cleanliness was more thorough."

Stayed a few nights","Lovely home, beautifully appointed. My 14 year old boys loved the hot tub and game room and we enjoyed all the great activities and sitting areas on the property. Laundry room was such a bonus. Loft area was a bit tight for teens, but would be great for smaller kids. A/C was perfect but bedrooms got a little warm so we kept the bedroom doors open and were all comfortable. A couple of non essential items were broken the owner wasn't aware of, but nothing that made our stay anything but great! My only criticism was that the kitchen was missing some essentials such as sharp knives and a large skillet and pot. There were spices and some cooking items but many were empty. Overall I would give our stay a 10/10! Honestly the cutest, most entertaining rental ever. If available, book it!!"

We loved the game room complete with surround sound and Wii system, and the outdoor fire table with TV was perfect for movie nights and s’mores. The basketball court and play structure were great for our kids and their varied ages. Even our lab enjoyed his first AirBNB stay to the fullest thanks to the well maintained dog run and pet friendly policy. The house was in a quiet, family friendly neighborhood and was just a short drive to downtown. The home was well stocked with amenities and the hosts were very responsive. Would definitely recommend!"

For me. .. I couldn't have asked for better resources to make memories with my mini men!
We stayed for 3 nights, had an amazing dinner at Taqueria Mexico. A Hellgate Dinner Jetboat Excursion the next day. We also found a cute creak to swim in. All the mini golf, hot tubing and games a person could want the rest of the time.
Thank you!"

The furniture and decorations are beautiful, the mini golf/ putting range is loads of fun, same as the very sturdy corn hole set. The hot tub and fire pit were just what we needed for a relaxing night; and the bed was so comfortable. The kitchen was small but super functional, and had lots of extras. As for the game room it went above and beyond my expectations. Loved the arcade style games and swinging chairs.
Personally I really loved the cleanliness of the space, and the provided cleaning supplies. It was a pleasant bonus.

Stayed with kids","The house was great for 2 adults and 3 kiddos! The backyard was wonderful for kids to run around and we enjoyed a very relaxing dip in the hot tub. And we loved the super cool arcade attached to the house.
The lofted bed is not easy to get up and down on, so keep that in mind when traveling with young kiddos or older adults. The upstairs space is mostly just for kids, with two small mattresses and sleeping bags. The kids loved it!
The kitchen is great for cooking basic meals, but the space and bakeware is limited so plan ahead. The oven is a half oven too as the space is definitely tight. But they have lots of dishes and a dishwasher which was handy!
All around it was a great experience and I highly recommend if you are in southern Oregon to explore. Lots of great hiking and outdoor areas not too far!"

Although we only live about 30 minutes away, this was one of our favorite/easiest vacations we've ever taken. The home WAS the destination. The little kids LOVED the loft and the game room and all the outdoor activities - even fun in the snow! Mom and dad loved having our own bedroom with a separate entry. We of course enjoyed the hot tub and the fire pit, and schooled our children at Mario Kart. The home itself was updated and modern. There were plenty of TV's, storage space, and kitchen necessities, although we ordered pizza one night and mainly just snacked! We were on vacation of course.

We loved our short stay, and will be sure to come back on another trip back up to see our kids in Washington!

Owners have carefully thought about everything down to the smallest detail - like an ipad to play music - to make your getaway enjoyable. There is literally something for everyone. The home is small but with the layout and the large outdoor space, we never felt cramped. There was plenty of room for everyone. Don't hesitate to book, you'll love it and so will your kids - teenagers too."

Stayed a few nights","This was the best stay we could have imagined! It was peaceful, fun and relaxing! Starting with the outside, there's so many fun activities for a couple, family, or coworkers! And it really is as beautiful as the listing describes! With the mini golf, corn hole, fire pit, game room, and hot tub you really don't need much else! There's also a market within walking distance if you needed anything, and food is only 10 minutes out! This was the best airbnb we have stayed at yet and highly reccomend it to anyone who's interested! It was definitely worth it and everything we needed! The amazing hosts communication throughout this whole process was the icing on the cake, such a sweet couple! We'll be staying again soon for sure!"

Stayed one night",It is not The host fault by any means. But I thought I got this room for 75$ a night. Oooops not true. I booked it for a second night out of necessity. This place is a nice location in downtown to all the bars. Private parking and discreet location. Problem is that this unit shares a wall. And the guest on the other side had unruly children that started yelling at each other @ 7:30 am. After not hearing an adult attempt to suppress their children’s actions I messaged the goats who must have taken care of it because the family left and I have not heard them since. I was happy with the 150+ night fee when I thought I had booked two nights. Not so happy when I realized I had only booked it for one night and had already been out drinking and was in no condition to drive anywhere. This is a 75$ a night unit if you ask me. Loud kids or not.

It was cozy and warm and clean, with good natural light. The shower was hot and had good water pressure. I needed to extend my stay a few times and the host was always prompt, accommodating and thoughtful. The location is perfect and just blocks away from a lot of good restaurants with shopping nearby as well. I will be staying here again."

Stayed one night","Unfortunately, I was never able to get inside. I arrived at 9pm, the arrival time I’d shared in advance. There was no clear way to open the gate. I messaged the hosts but didn’t receive a response until 11 hours later, so I had to find a hotel to stay at that night.
I learned later that I was supposed to pull on a bottle opener to open the gate. I’ve never encountered a gate like that before. I’ve stayed in over 22 different airbnbs and lived and traveled around the world, but I’ve never had an issue with a gate or self-check-in. This could have been solved easily just with a faster message response time. Unfortunately, my refund request was denied.
Please note the app required me to rate other aspects of the space, but I didn’t actually experience them. There wasn’t an option to leave them blank."

The space itself was clean but lacked a level of polish and thoughtfulness which makes me wish I had booked a hotel instead. The bath mat was wet on arrival, and the towels were small and rough. There was also a window on top of the front door that I would like to be able to cover because it looks directly into the bathroom. The space was small but I’d say they’ve done enough to make it feel cozy, but there were certain things like the towels and an uncomfy bed that took away from the stay."

Very clean and well-maintained- you can tell a lot of thought went into designing the studio. Having stayed in hotels in the area many times, we felt this was by far a better value than any of them.
For working from the space- The Wifi supported Zoom calls without issue and the area is quiet during the day. There are plenty of outlets too.
For personal time- The outdoor area is great for lounging or dining. The location makes walking to the farmers market and most of the downtown area easy.
The hosts are wonderful. We needed to extend our stay and they were quick and kind about it.
All around a great stay!! We will book again!!"

Coffee and basic amenities are provided. It's a great little spot. The only downside and reason I would not rebook is the very uncomfortable bed with squeaky frame, only two cheap feeling pillows, and minimal bedding given it's winter (no comforter, only a thin quilt in combination with a lack of flannel or warmer winter sheets). There were two extra blankets and another quilt so thankfully it was warm enough with both heaters going."

Stayed a few nights","This place was so stinking cute! Perfect for the trip. I needed somewhere in town - close to the hospital. It was everything I really needed. The little kitchen area is perfect- waterfall shower is amazingly hot and the courtyard is great. The design of the studio and the fireplace is amazing for ambience- fair warning it does not actually provide heat but the hosts do also provide a heater! You do share a wall with another Airbnb (I believe?) and the guests next to me were incredibly noisy the second night-
It seriously sounded like they were wrestling and slamming into the walls. Thankfully I had earplugs and that’s really not something you can control with Airbnb so I was understanding. The bed would be my only serious comment. Not really that comfortable. For the price and the location- I really appreciated the space and the opportunity to be close to where I needed to be! A great space for a great price ❤️"

Stayed one night","If you're going back and forth between this place and another....BOOK THIS ONE! This was such a warm, cozy stay for a night on my way to San Diego from northern Washington (I'm a travel nurse)....I stay in these very often and I learn what makes for a good air bnb. This one, is a good one. Probably one of the best ones I have ever stayed in. The shower was amazing, the pressure and size of the shower was perfect. The glass fireplace honestly made my stay. It changes colors, heat settings and speeds. I had some wine with this going and it was perfect after a long day of driving. The bed is very comfortable. The outside area is very spacious and cozy with the string lights and waterfall. I did have some trouble finding the place in the dark but Mason called me right away and answered my questions. A very nice keurig/coffee pot was provided as well as kcups from a local coffee shop. I really appreciated this because you would be surprised how many air bnbs don't even provide coffee or a coffee maker. 10/10 recommend this place. Thanks for allowing me to stay!"

Unfortunately there was dog fur all over and inside the linens on the bed which resulted in an allergic reaction. Mason & Shelby we're incredibly unprofessional and apathetic in their response to my concern. I ultimately sought resolution through Airbnb because of it because I didn't feel safe. 'Pet friendly ' doesn't mean it's an excuse to have dog fur everywhere.

Stayed with kids","Host was great to work with! Requested early check in the day prior to arrival, got in early without issue. Perfect for our family. Traveled with 5 adults and 1 toddler. Rooms were perfect, back yard fully fenced and lots of shade for hanging out. Plenty of space to spread out and a game room in the garage. House was stocked with all of the basic needs. Very pleased, would ABSOLUTELY stay again!"

Charity's place was a breath of fresh air. The beds were comfortable, the house was clean, and there was a lot of space to stretch out and relax. We were super thrilled with the hot tub. It was bigger than expected and very clean. Anything we needed we were able to find at the house.
The location was great, close to our family and close to stores and restaurants.
We would definitely stay here again 🙂"

Its very nice and clean.
Great beds! Very nice hot tub also.
It's nothing super fancy but I don't mean that in a bad way it's very nice and very well-equipped as far as thoughtfulness and availability of things like sugar & creamer for coffee or hair dryer, straightener and spices to cook. I have stayed in a lot of airbnbs and I appreciate those little details and comfy beds more than anything!
Host was friendly and gracious even with us having some issues that made us less then perfect guests.
Definitely recommend"

The home was immaculate (and such a cool space!), and every amenity you could think of was provided already. From spices, to shampoo and conditioner, to coffee, anything we thought we'd forgotten to pack was already there for us - Charity thought of everything! The location was great, easy to find, and close to everything we needed. And our host Charity was a dream - super responsive, very friendly, and wonderful to work with. Would 100% stay again, and highly recommend this home and this host. If I could give more than five stars, I would!"

Stayed with kids","Couch was super comfy and the kids loved the garage space with the pool/air hockey table. The hot tub was also a plus but the water was way too high, so whenever someone got in it spilled over the sides. The water pressure in the shower was WAY TOO HIGH. It was actually painful to shower. For what we got, I think it was slightly overpriced. But good enough for one evening."

House is MCM, and as such, is dated but it is what we expected and everything is in good shape, and pretty cool. Pictures are accurate. Home was clean, well laid out...I like that there are a couple common areas so if the TV is on, others have another place to talk, or read. Only negative is that the paved patio area is small. Neighborhood felt completely safe, and is close in and easy to find. We only had a short time, so Charity offering an earlier check-in, (without us asking) was very nice. We would definitely stay here again."

My bed was a little too soft and made my back hurt but that's no fault of the owner. My mom's bed suited her well. Everything was clean. My only complaint is that we didn't get to use the game room which we were really disappointed about, because it was just too dang cold even with the space heater on. We were looking forward to it, but it's OK. Maybe we're not as acclimated to the cold as the locals."

Stayed with a pet","Charity was a gracious, responsive, and helpful host with an AMAZING home!!
The house is impeccable, adorable, perfect for families and pets! We will definitely go back!
The kitchen and fridge are amazing, and well-outfitted for a family!
My kids also enjoyed the game room! And the big TV!
So many beds, pillows, and blankets in airbnbs are cheap and uncomfortable but these were so nice and high-quality. We have a sensitive sleeper who travels with a mattress pad, and he didn’t even need it (for the first time ever)!!
We unfortunately ended up there during fire season and the smoke made it impossible for us to do what we’d planned. Charity made it easy to leave early, even though the shortened stay was in no way her fault. Also, the AC in the home made it possible for us to stay in comfort and clean air! 🙏
There were wifi issues the first day, and Charity not only helped me troubleshoot, but she called the service provider, and the issues were resolved for the rest of our stay."

There’s everything you will need at her place as far as cooking, bedding and hanging out, even cleaning if you stay long enough. I brought my dogs this last time because they have a fenced backyard. Charity and her husband are absolutely awesome hosts! We had to extend our stay unexpectedly and they had another rental for us which was absolutely incredible. They are very responsive and I was granted the opportunity to actually meet with charity. You will love their place, I guarantee it. There’s plenty of parking and the game room is awesome! Don’t forget about the hot tub ☺️ I can’t say enough good things about them and their housekeepers. Whomever rents, will be in good hands."

Charity our host communicated very well and made sure our stay was great even allowed us to stay a little longer before we checked out so when didn’t have to rush the morning we left. Highly recommend this place!
