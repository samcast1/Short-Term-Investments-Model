Stayed a few nights","We stayed at Ryan’s place for BSU graduation weekend, and this place was a gem. It was exactly as described, small and quaint, and beautifully decorated. The local hotels were significantly overpriced for graduation and we saved a ton staying at Ryan’s place, with much nicer accommodations. It was a short 10-15 minute drive to campus. I highly recommend this place if you are visiting Muncie!"

Stayed a few nights","David's Ball house was exactly as pictured and described on their Airbnb website. The Ball house was a newly remodeled two bedroom single family house, which offered much privacy. The house was located is a residential area that was very safe and walkable. The Ball house was conveniently located a few blocks from the Ball State campus, and near many eateries, breweries and grocery stores. I found the bed to be very comfortable, and the bathroom and shower were great. The flat screen TV and WiFi worked great too. Everything worked out very well for my short 2-night stay. Excellent communications with David regarding location and entry instructions. Overall, the Ball house was an outstanding Airbnb."

Stayed with a pet","We loved our first stay at the Ball house so much, we booked another night!
Great home on a quiet street near ahops and restaurants. The home is very clean, smalls good (no pet odors/smells), and has everything you need to comfortably settle in. We will definitely book again with David. His communication was stellar. We had zero problems/issues. We felt safe the entire time. The shower has amazing water pressure (better than ours at home!), and the water gets really hot (I love a hot shower). The beds are more on the firm side (in my opinion), but we slept fine. The 2 chairs in the living room recline and are super comfy! TV has Roku and worked well for us. The home is equipped with dishes, silverware, pots & pans, towels, a broom, soap, and a washer and dryer. Full size fridge is a bonus! Good size backyard for our small dog. 5 stars from us!

Stayed with a pet","Very cute house on a quiet street. Just what we needed for a restful night. Hubby and I felt safe the entire time. No problems. No loud noise. Quiet street/neighbors. The beds are a little firm for my liking, but I still got a decent nights sleep. This home was clean and had everything we needed. Has a decent sized back yard so letting my little dog out to potty was easy. This home is very close to eateries, shops and a grocery store which added a level of convenience that (some) standard hotels cannot provide. This is a great Air bnb with a fair price. I would definitely stay here again and again. I highly recommend this Air bnb (and the hosts) to anyone traveling through Muncie (and surrounding areas). Check in is easy, and I appreciated the added YouTube videos for extra instrunction(s). Nice touch!
This Air bnb gets a 5 star rating from me!

Stayed with a pet","We have stayed at several houses in Muncie when we visit family in town, this place was by far the best place we have stayed. The house is lovely, very clean, and had plenty in the kitchen to meet our needs. The linens were nice and new, and the beds were comfortable. We really enjoyed the shower- great pressure and good temperature. We hope the Ball House is available for our next trip to Muncie as we will definitely stay again!"

The first time I stayed at the Ball House I knew this needed to be my home while I was down there working. My time has come to an end of working down there and will miss staying here. David and Cody are both awesome and great to work with! If my travels ever take me back to Muncie I will definitely be checking the availability here!

Place was very clean overall except the baseboards covered in dirt and dust. We did have trouble sleeping as mattresses are extra firm and we are used to soft mattresses at home but that is our personal preference. Overall great place to stay in Muncie and we enjoyed our stay at the Ball House.

Stayed a few nights","We recently had the pleasure of staying at The Ball House, and it was a truly delightful experience. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted by a peaceful environment. The property felt secure, giving us peace of mind throughout my stay. :)
The comfort and coziness of the ball house is great. The accommodation provided all the amenities we needed, and it felt like a true home away from home. The cleanliness of the space was impeccable, made us feel instantly at ease.
One standout feature of The Ball House was the beautiful driveway. It added a touch of elegance to the property and made parking a breeze, plus the security of cameras made it even better.
Lastly, I must mention the amazing host David/Cody who made our stay even more memorable. They were friendly, attentive, and went above and beyond to ensure we had a comfortable and enjoyable time. Their hospitality truly enhanced the experience.
The Ball House is easily one of the best stays in Muncie."

I use to live 2 blocks from the train, so I loved hearing the trains at night, and my kids only heard them the first night. The house had everything we needed and was very clean."

Stayed a few nights","This house is perfectly appointed. Our family of 6 felt immediately at home in this comfortable property, with a beautiful interior and practical layout. Everyone from our youngest at three years old, to our teenagers, enjoyed our stay, with plenty of room to move and also lovely places to gather as a family. There are board games, a piano, and toys, colouring and puzzles for the littlies.
Essentials are an easy few minutes walk away, for pharmacy and grocery items, and takeaway food and coffee, and we had a fun family meal at the Mexican restaurant.
We stayed 5 nights in the middle of winter and the house was always warm and cosy for the children.
BSU was comfortable walking distance of around 20 minutes.
I would recommend this home to people of all ages, and particularly for families. A fantastic and always responsive host."

The train is REALLY close and horn goes of at ALL times of the night. The alarm system beeps every 10-15 minutes around the clock. There is a musty and paint smell that gave us a headache the first night. The downstairs bathroom is REALLY small. We had everything we needed. The updates were cute and made you feel at home. It was about 30-37 minutes from prairie creek reservoir. We enjoyed our stay. Our two boys LOVED the air hokey table!! Easy check in and checkout.

Stayed a few nights","Small space crowded with old furnitures, difficult to move around. The mirror/ hang clothes table fell three times on my head. While the host tries to be welcoming, you may experiencing while you stay there lack of privacy. The door where you enter to the bedroom where you sleep has glass window and doesn't have curtain. You always have to go through the entrance of the house. On one instance the host left the dog out and the god attacked me. Be careful with interacting with the host as it may lack professionalism, respect. If you plan to solve items with the host, I definitely you work only through airbnb app because the host may text you endlessly with more than 40 text messages in one hour. It is not worth the money as it is more expensive than other places in the area. Unfortunately, the location is good but the place is old built with no healthy HVAC system which may harm your health at your stay. Strongly recommend to avoid it."

This place is an oasis that made me recall a Relais & Chateaux vacation to the Luberon in the south of France... hats off to Holly!!"

It was an adorable guest house that was super clean, easy to access and really comfortable for me and my family. I initially selected this place for me and husband however at the last min, my teenage son decided to join us on our trip. I quickly messaged Holly about it and whe was super responsive and willing to accommodate the last min change. She had an additional twin bed set up for my son and it was perfect for what we needed. She also followed up to ensure that we were comfortable with our room. I will definitely recommend this place and wouldn't hesitant to stay here again in the future.

Stayed a few nights","Cole and Margee's place is almost exactly what you see in the advertisement. It is a very nice house, in what seemed to be a very nice little Family Neighborhood, especially since South Muncie kind of has a bad rap. It was quite, and all we seen our whole stay were families, with a lot of people who would smile and wave. Cole and Margee were very accommodating. Our only issue the whole time was that a prior guest (I'm guessing,) had signed them out of one TV network which was available for use, but Margee quickly responded with a User name and Password for us to use. The only thing I observed which I am sure can be attributed to the new host status, was that the kitchen needs a few little things, that a guest would possibly feel lost without, if they were planning on preparing meals, but I am sure Cole and Margee are consistently taking inventory from their guest's reviews and comments, to make sure they are comfortable.... If we come back home to Indiana next year, I will be looking to see if this house is open, but I have a feeling it won't be, so jump on it quick."

There are stairs to climb right off, so if you can’t go on stairs, pick a one story place. We loved everything. We really liked the bay windows in the kitchen. I think this place is much prettier in person than the pictures. Bigger too. Loved it all. Good snacks and water, nice refrigerator and freezer. Great place to cook and just sit and enjoy. A must place to visit. Thank you so much!"

I was unable to host them at my house due to major renovations we were doing. So being able to book this with only a 2 week notice, was amazing. Sherry was great to work with and corresponded quickly with me. She even gave us advanced notice of the place being available a little earlier so we could access it for our visit. It was perfect for our visit as well as for my nephew to stay. It was so comfortable and beautifully decorated. There were books to read, games the kids could play, snacks and coffee available, and plenty of comfortable seating for all of us. I definitely recommend this for anyone to stay."

Her meticulous attention to detail truly shines through here, from the carefully preserved architecture of this 1892 Queen Anne Victorian home to the newly renovated, well appointed interiors that provide all the comforts of today - all while keeping that historical charm. This place is great, it was such a pleasant stay! An Airbnb done right. Thank you, Sherry!"

The host is absolutely delightful, she’s there when you need her, but also gives plenty of privacy. The house is amazing, beautifully decorated, has everything that you didn’t even think that you needed, and to top it off the memory foam beds were much welcome after a long bike ride. Sherry is helpful, friendly, insightful, flexible and has thought of everything to make you feel like a guest of honor in the home."

The kitchen was fully equipped. There were so many little details that made the stay so welcoming and hassle free, including the soap and shampoo in the bathroom, the ice in the freezer, the bottles of water in the kitchen, the guest book that included recommendations for places to eat and things to do, etc. The living room has a nice tv and comfortable couch for watching Netflix and other streaming services or playing games with the board game or the deck of cards they provide. I like the separate entry and how private the space felt. At the same time, Sherry made it clear that we could contact her if we needed anything. Thank you for a great stay!"

Stayed one night","The set up and location is 10 stars. everything is easy. beds super comfy. plush linens. natural shower soaps, perfectly appointed kitchen, not an overwhelming amount of clutter. the only area not clean was a small floor area under a tiny table in the bathroom, and the inside of the coffee maker. the space was like being at a retreat center!
I forgot to ask if scented products were used before I booked, so had to use my own sleeping bag and move (to the small spare bedroom) the linens, trash bags, sanitary napkin bags and ask her to take out the plug -in, which she won't be reinstalling.
As those with MCS are sensitive to chemicals, we know it takes a long while to air out the toxic floral smell residue, but I was lucky to have a benedryl with me, and it was plenty warm in the middle of winter to open the windows and run the bathroom fan.
I would return to this amazing house for sure, but don't know what she would do to replace her product habits, including blue Dawn."

The Eagles Nest was done in a way that doesn’t take away from it’s historical value. We absolutely loved the decor and Appreciated the extra steps made for our comfort. It snowed overnight during our stay here and awoke to find that our car had been cleared of the snow. THANKS SO MUCH for that. We Definitely recommend and Hope to visit again! Thanks so much, Cecelia & James"

Sherry was an amazing host. After riding 60 miles on bikes on the Cardinal Greenway Trail, the Eagles Nest was a haven, in a beautiful residential area. Sherry made sure we could secure our bikes in the garage, check-in easily, and even had some tasty chocolate bites and other treats available to re-energize us! Great hot shower with large rainfall head and handheld option. Everything you might need in the bathroom and kitchen. Comfortable living room area. Good WiFi. TV worked great, we were even able to pick up a college football game. Room temps were good with ceiling fans in the living room and bedroom. We walked a mile into downtown Muncie to Vera Mae’s Bistro for a lovely dinner. Clean, comfy bed. We slept well, and got right back on the Greenway early the next morning. The Eagles Nest was everything we wanted!"

Gorgeous home with a wonderfully renovated airbnb space at a great rate. Everything you could possibly want for an extended stay, wish we had needed more than just the one night.
Cozy beds, comfy living area, spacious bathroom and quaint kitchen! I'll have to think of an excuse to get back to Muncie and stay at Sherry's again soon!

Stayed a few nights","Eric & April's place was a gift from God to me and exactly what I was looking for! It provided time to reflect, retreat, and rejuvenate. Because of the clear description on amenities, I knew to bring food that could be warmed up in the microwave, which was great! I was able to focus on the purpose of my stay rather than meal prep. The beautiful scenery and decor in the apartment surrounded me with a serene environment of peace. I enjoyed the bluetooth speaker and wifi hook-ups. I was able to play my favorite worship music and fill the space with praise as I read, prayed, and listened. The bed was comfortable and I took advantage of the mounted roku tv to watch my favorite show on Prime and keep up with world events and posts on YouTube at the end of the day. The location allowed me to pop in to Muncie within 10 minutes to grab anything I could have wanted! I found a scrumptious treat at the local bakery, Concannon's. Thank you for opening your home & providing me this blessing!"

Stayed a few nights","I accidentally booked in Muncie, instead of Marion. But I was so excited to stay here, I decided not to change my reservation after noticing my error.
I’m from the city and a little slice of quiet in nature was just what I needed. Great hosts in a lovely spot. I enjoyed the deck and the view from the window very much. Excellent communication and clear markings on the property. Very well managed property with kind hosts. Thanks for a nice little break in your beautiful property."

Stayed a few nights","This was such a great place for a much needed solitary retreat! My husband gifted this to me as a time to be still and grieve the unexpected loss of my dad. Even in dreary Indiana February, Eric and April's place was beautiful and serene. I was able to take a soak in the jet tub and then sit in front of a huge window and just watch their horses and relax. This was a perfect place to be alone with the Lord and read. The bathroom was clean, the bed cozy, and the kitchen supplied with a few thoughtful extras. I came back with my heart full and feel like every person could benefit from spending a few days at this perfect retreat spot!"

Stayed a few nights","I am from Eaton and have a lot of family in Muncie but I was there for my Aunts funeral and wanted a quiet place to retreat to at night. Eric and April gave me that place. I felt at home and I will most definitely stay with them again when I go back to visit my family there.
The only thing missing was a hand rail up the ramp. (Lol).
I also have to go stay with them again so I can use the big tub with the jets. :)
So if you are looking for that homey cozy feeling away from home I would recommend staying with Eric and April."

There were signs to guide you to it, thankfully. The hosts were good communicators. They provided hot cocoa, coffee, and popcorn for snacks, a great help since I didn't want to go out the stormy evening I arrived. It was clean and quite private. I actually never saw anyone in person during my stay. I would definitely stay here again."

The place is perfect for a couple but would not recommend for more than 3 people due to there only being a one bed (I believe queen size) and sofa. It was very clean and all listed amenities were available and easy to access. I definitely in the future, if I am in the area for travel will be trying to stay again!! Thank you Deborah and Matt again!"

Stayed a few nights","Inside the bnb itself is very cute, very clean and very cozy!! Has pretty much everything you would need and Deborah was even kind enough to check if her iron had a steam function for me before my stay. She also provided extra comforters and a space heater for one of the colder nights. The bed has a memory foam mattress that is comfy but definitely sucks you in by the middle of the night. I took turns with my friend sleeping on the futon and neither of us found it particularly comfortable but if it’s just you, the bed will do just fine! The actual location of the house is in an area that seems either up and coming or semi-vacant and gives an eerie feel at night but if you can see past that, this is a sweet place with lots of personal touches."

It's right by the Greenway Trail so if you like to unwind or start your morning with a nice walk (or run) by the river, it's only a block away. If I go to more classes in the future, I'm definitely going to try to stay here again."

The couch was extra comfy and I enjoyed sitting out on the porch when the weather allowed it. It is on a busier street and the trains were pretty loud, but earplugs were helpful for sleeping and train noise isn't unique to this home. Could use some upgraded pillows, in my opinion. I had a slight issue that was resolved promptly by the host, which I appreciated. Overall, it had what I needed for my stay, and I would look to stay here again when visiting my daughter at Ball State."

Good to have Keurig and lots of coffee pod choices, as well as a bunch of snacks to nosh on. Good internet to watch a movie on my tablet. I could have tried the TV but already had a couple of shows lined up on my device. The place was VERY clean and not cluttered. I like the decorating. I did have an issue with the new digital Yale lockbox as the code given in the email was old as was the code for the key lockbox. I contacted Cheryl thru AirBnb and she responded quickly with new codes. Nice stay."

Stayed one night","This place is adorable. It was easy to find, easy to enter, very clean and nicely decorated. The only thing I was thrown off by is that there's only 1 queen bed, and the description made it sound like there was 2, which we thought one was a sofa bed, but it's not. However, the sofa is wide, so wasn't too bad to sleep on, and we were only there 1 night anyway. The snacks were a nice touch and thankful that she had bottled water in the refrigerator.
I'd definitely stay again."

Stayed a few nights","This is a lovely, renovated house in what seems to be a renaissance area of Muncie. The house has old, lovely wood trim that is warm and welcoming while the furnishings and kitchen are new, clean, and comfortable. Cheryl provides lots of niceties including coffee, snacks, bottles of water, Roku TV, and a book with details on local attractions. There's easy access to downtown and I was amazed at the lovely Vera Mae's restaurant. Not only was the food great but the decor is fun. There's lots of casual food nearby too. Parking is on the side street and but pretty much dedicated to the house. The front street is busy but the bedroom in the back is quiet. I'd go back, for sure!"

Stayed a few nights","Convenient, clean, and cozy! I stayed at Brian’s place while visiting my son (BSU student). The home is super convenient to campus and nestled in a quiet, walkable neighborhood. I “worked from home” with great WiFi connectivity and super quiet surroundings. Great water pressure and warmth in the shower. Brian and I communicated prior to my arrival via in-app messaging; he was friendly and thorough. I didn’t use the TVs. My son has 3 semesters to go and I can see myself back at Brian’s in the future."

I had been driving a far way and was having a hard time locating check information (all on me). Messaged Nick and response time was almost instant. Great location malls, food and we even got to watch Ball State University Volleyball. Another plus! Highly recommend 😊"
