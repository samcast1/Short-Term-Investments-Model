Stayed a few nights","The Hive has literally EVERYTHING you need besides clothing! We have not stayed anywhere else with so many amenities. The community of Lagro is very small and peaceful with beautiful surroundings. The snacks, condiments, coffee/tea, and s'mores supplies available in the kitchen was such a blessing! We unfortunately weren't there long enough to take advantage of such nice amenities. The provided ziploc bags were a lifesaver since we forgot to bring some!! The beds were quite comfortable...my parents wanted to take theirs home! Thank you for the opportunity to enjoy your home, Barb! We will be back and for sure plan days to just stay out in Largo!!"

Group trip",We were so pleased with our AirBnB choice! The house was right out of HGTV. They thought of everything. The owners put some real TLC into this place and it showed. The host was responsive and she provided us with bikes during our stay which was a lovely bonus. We will be back!

Stayed about a week",The BeeHive was a perfect fit for our family Christmas gathering. Barb has thought of everything and then some. It was super cozy and has all the amenities. Quiet and beautiful scenery. The house feels bigger than what the pictures portray. We comfortably feed 12 people for Christmas dinner. There is a new breakfast spot within walking distance and a walking trail just outside the front door.

Stayed with kids",I can't say enough good things about this beautiful home. The decor was amazing. It was by far the most comfortable and beautiful Airbnb I had ever stayed in. We were mostly just using the home to sleep since we have a farmhouse in the area that gets way too crowded during the holidays. I wish I could have spent more time at this gorgeous Airbnb!

Group trip","Highly recommend Barb's home. In over a decade of AirBnB/VRBO rentals, this ranks as one of the top places we've stayed. The kitchen was the best stocked we have experienced. Between the pots and pans, spices, dishes, and silverware, there wasn't anything else we could have needed. The coffee/hot beverage bar was amazing, so many choices. They have done a phenomenal job updating a 1930s-era home so that it has all of the modern amenities without losing any of the period charm. The decorating is great, so many things to look at. We were able to spend some time in Lagro and everyone was very friendly and welcoming. Thank you for sharing your home."

Group trip","We were in the area for a wedding, but this would be a great place for a walking or biking holiday along the Wabash river. The Wabash river trail is right in front of this location and Kokiwanee Nature Preserve is very close by. The house was pristine and had all the amenities of a 5 star accommodation. I would definitely choose this location again to stay. Thank you!"

Stayed with kids","The Hive was the perfect place to stay for our family, we only wished we had more time to relax at the house. The hosts did not leave any amenities out! Barb was super quick and responsive to my questions. The coffee bar was amazing and we thoroughly enjoyed having it out in the sunroom. If you plan to cook, everything you could possibly need is there, with the exception of the actual food. Beds were all comfy and plenty of room for the seven adults and one child we had. There’s a great walking path that runs along the river and it was pretty with the changing leaves on the trees. The house was beautifully decorated for fall. This house won’t disappoint! Thank you for being such gracious hosts!"

The house was beautifully decorated and perfect for our stay. The kitchen is fully stocked for cooking and dining and living rooms provide lots of space for visiting. Beds were very comfortable as well. We will be back!

Barb even offered to pick up groceries for us before we arrived which was really thoughtful. The river walk is right across the street and was nice to walk in the mornings. Speakeasy is also right across the street and had great food and drinks!

Stayed a few nights",We had a great stay that provided easy access to the Nickle Plate and Pan Handle bike trails. Misty and Mark were most accommodating and the studio guest quarters were extremely comfortable. They have upgraded the seating from the gray couch to Lazy-Boy love seat recliners! Likely the cleanest Air B&B we have experienced. No steps and the curb less shower is much appreciated for us seniors. It was a little challenging finding the correct drive but there address number is on the mailbox and when you look for the white finish it is very obvious.

Stayed a few nights","Spacious, pristine, simple, charming, and everything we needed for our getaway from it all stay! Misty replied to any questions almost immediately! Mattress was softer than we were used to, so we were surprised at how comfortable it actually was - and the bedding was so cozy! The pond and woods trails provided an entertaining variety of nature for curious nature buffs like me. A beautiful, serene place. I plan to bring my daughter and her girls here soon! Tip: the bathroom is done in an industrial theme. It has a concrete floor that gets slippery when wet. There are a couple of bath mats on the floor and nice-sized non-skid mats in the shower. Those with falling or balance issues might want to bring flip-flops or shower shoes for extra precaution. We usually camp in our camper when we travel but love this place so much, we'll likely make this an annual (at least) to come visit."

Stayed with a pet","Just came back from spending 3 nights there with my pup. It was one of my fav airbnbs so far. The place was super easy to find and I was impressed by how clean and simple everything was. I’m super picky about how clean a place feels when you first walk in and I had absolutely no issues, not a cob web in sight, and I didn’t feel like I had to keep all my bags off the floor lol. The mini kitchen was just enough for me to prepare the food I packed and the shower in the bathroom is amazing. I specifically was looking for a place that was lowkey, quiet, AND had access to a pond for fishing and this was perfect. I even caught my first 5 pound bass! The hosts were super welcoming and accommodating especially when it came to having my dog with me. I already told them I plan to come back."

Parking is right in front and private behind their home. It offers basic amenities (coffee but no cream or sugar sorta deal) and is safe and quiet in the country. They have large dogs on the property which didn't bother me at all, but if you don't like big dogs be forewarned. I recommend this space in rural Indiana."

Stayed a few nights","A great price for a clean, quaint, cute, and convenient bungalow in Wabash. This place has everything you need including snacks and drinks and could not be more cute and clean. Host is attentive and responsive. Delicious pub grub was literally steps away and everything else was walkable or a very short drive. My husband and I enjoyed our stay here and loved the cozy gas fireplace. There are 2 bedrooms upstairs and a sleeper sofa downstairs. We chose the sleeper to be near bathroom which is on lower level. We loved Wabash and found this place to be a real gem in a jewel of a city."

And when we needed an extended checkout because of a sick child they were so accommodating!
The memory foam bed was so comfy!
There was a very cool park that our kids loved within walking distance of the house plus a very nice small downtown to walk through in Wabash!
For future guests: just be aware that the stairs to the upstairs are very steep and wouldn't be good for anyone who struggles with balance. But my kids thought they were an adventure :)
Overall a good experience! Thank you Kyle & Aubrey!"

We would 100% be back. But for anyone with balance/mobility issues, be warned that the stairs are very steep and the bathroom is on the main level so you have to go down if you wake in the middle of the night. To counteract that, the hosts installed a fantastic motion sensing light on the stairs.
We will definitely be back when we visit family here again and look forward to doing more on market street!"

We walked downtown to the first Friday event. Also walked to Friendship Hill Park. GREAT PARK. Our kids loved it. Would have liked to walk across the street to Dye’s Bar and Grill but weren’t able. Weather was bad Saturday so we stayed in and watched a lot of Netflix. Appreciated the snacks and bottled water our hosts left.
FYI You have to walk through the bedroom with the twin beds to get to the second bedroom with the queen bed. Worked fine for us though."

The YMCA- $20 daily drop in if you’re a non member.
Inclusive Park with handicap access, right behind the Y.
Oh My Cakes! Great bakery.
Farmers market.
Theater that had a showing of Spider-Man.
_________________________________
As far as the property itself, the sleeping accommodations were comfortable and clean- definitely bring your own pillows.
The narrow staircase does have carpet on it, and there is a step that is weakly enforced and I did not feel very comfortable on that. There also was a nail that poked through the carpet on that step.
The living room is comfy, clean and there’s a good amount of seating. The kitchen does have a good share of utensils and plates, etc to prepare yourself meals.
The one bathroom is stocked with towels- would be better with some fabreez or aerosol bathroom spray 😂.
The doors self lock after you and are easy to operate.
Outside of the stairs, the only off putting thing are the multiple laminated signs with the rules, there are multiple on the stairs all over the kitchen/halls. Kinda gives a vibe of overbearing parents leaving kids at home. Now, obviously this shows care for the property, just from my pov isn’t very welcoming.
Overall good experience and high-level communication."

Stayed a few nights","This adorable little cottage was absolutely perfect! The location is convenient to downtown, the inside is neat as a pin, and all the thoughtful touches made my stay feel like home instead of a generic hotel room.
The kitchen is ready for use with a full-sized fridge and stove, a 12-cup coffee maker and a single-cup coffee maker (coffee pods provided!) and enough dishes for everyone to enjoy a meal.
Plenty of fluffy towels in the bathroom, shampoo, conditioner and shower gel too was a nice touch.
All the beds were comfortable, with plenty of pillows and bedding for everyone.
The stairs to the second floor are a tad steep, but manageable, the motion-sensor light really is helpful.
Unfortunately, our visit was in winter so we did not enjoy the covered patio.
My favorite amenity however was the fireplace in the living room. So cozy!
I am so glad that I found this place for my visit to the Wabash. We have family in the area, and will certainly book another stay here.
Thank you for making our weekend trip memorable Kyle and Aubrey!"

Stayed a few nights","Cute house & ideal location. We were alittle disappointed with the kitchen. The pans were very dirty & wouldn't come clean. So we just ended up going & buying a few to use while there. We saw a mouse & that was alittle nerve wracking. But not uncommon for a rural area I suppose. The stairs going up stairs are very narrow, steep & small. Not for everyone. My fibromylagia wasnt a fan at all. We ended up just staying downstairs. Not all of the lights have lightbulbs so they are more for looks & not function I guess. The water pressure in the shower is very weak. We usually have a different bnb that we stay at & wanted to try something new. Overall it was ok. There were signs for pets so if you travel with your pets then this would be a good place. Nice yard if you have kids or pets accompany with you. There is a bar across the street. Only Friday night were they loud enough to sorta be a bother. The rest of the time it was fine. Hosts seemed nice & communicated well. Otherwise all seemed ok."

Stayed a few nights","We were impressed with all the comforts of home in this rental. We slept well, enjoyed meals at home, but also could have easily enjoyed the dining out too. We rented for a quick weekend trip and made the most of Wabash downtown offerings by taking a short walk (2 blocks?) to the farmer's market Saturday morning, add a block or 2 for a cup of morning Joe at Modoc's...etc. You get the picture - great location, great rental home with the comforts of home at a great price too. Kyle and Aubrey were super quick to respond, and checked in with us to make sure we were good after check-in; all the instructions were accurate and complete. No worries or complaints from us! Thank you!"

There were extra keys so we could come and go independently of one another.
There was an ice maker and two dishwashers along with a huge refrigerator. Plenty of room to keep everything cold.
Took us a little time to figure out how to watch TV but we managed.
Would 100% rent again!
Be sure to read parking instructions carefully! I drove around the block a couple times to figure out there was virtually no parking on site. There was an “unloading” zone but we still had to haul our bags up the side walk to main level, the lower level was more convenient. The parking was about a block away across another parking lot."

There was so much to see and do within walking distance like history, art, boutique shopping, delicious restaurants, shows, hiking, kayaking, and a trolley ride.

Group trip","The Sanctuary was a wonderful stay and prefect for what we needed. I took a small group of high schooler for weekend retreat and they LOVED it. They couldn’t stop raving about it. It was the perfect set up for a separate guy and girls dorm if needed. Plenty of bathrooms and large spaces for girls to get ready. The place was beautiful, clean, cozy and peaceful. So restful and relaxing. Jennifer was a great host and the kitchen was well stocked with basic cooking stuff making it great for cooking for a larger group of people. Easy access to restaurants and stores. A great find!"

The kitchen was fully stocked with everything needed for cooking large meals...the island...oh my! Two dishwashers made it easy to keep a clean kitchen at all times. We never ran out of ice due to the under counter ice maker. The table sat all of us comfortably! The downstairs table had board games going all weekend long. Jennifer was very helpful and reached out to make sure everything was good and to see if we had any questions. They also have a luggage cart to help with unloading everything from your car! Everyone enjoyed their stay. Thank you Jennifer!"

If you are looking for a place to gather and don’t need a lot to entertain you in the immediate surrounding area, this is the perfect place!

He gave excellent recommendations for local food and shops, and told us a lot about the history of the town and how much work he’s put into making it beautiful.

We ventured out in the area and did some antique shopping in North Manchester, Roann, and Wabash (all short drives). My grandpa was born in 1926, in Largo, and very likely may have been in the general store that was here in the Riparian. He passed in 2003. The Riparian is a very neat piece of history brought back to life. We loved the little pieces of history preserved
or incorporated into the building along with the industrial style decor. Very cool place and it had everything we needed for our stay."

Stayed a few nights","Riparian House is exactly as described. It is peaceful, quaint, and in a very old building dating back to the 1820’s that has been restored. If you are looking for night-life, keep looking as this house is in a small Indiana town that rolls up the sidewalks Come 9:00 pm. But if you are looking for hiking and biking trails, eagles nearby, a river out the back window, solitude, and a building with historical significance, this is the place. Riparian House is a studio with a huge bath and a fantastic shower, a great bed, and very soft and luxurious sheets and towels. There is a newer restaurant next door for lunch and dinner and the towns of Wabash and Huntington are a short distance for variety and groceries. The town of Lagro also has a Creamery and a Coffee Shop. My only issue during my stay was a wonky key box but Justin owns the Bistro next door so all I had to do was drop off the key at the restaurant. Beverly was quick to turn around questions relative to reservations."

Stayed a few nights","What an amazing place in such a nice little town! Since our retirement, we have been traveling all over rural America riding our bikes. This was one of our best Adventures ever! The Riparian House, with such a rich history, and beautifully done renovations has been the coolest place we have stayed at to date. The local contact person, Justin, truly made us feel at home.
He operates the 950 Speakeasy Bistro, right next to the Riparian House. It was so convenient to get great food right next store and this also made for easy communications between us and our host. The little town has so much to offer. Jeremy, the owner of the Canal Creamery, even opened up for us on his closed days, so that we could get our daily fix of quality ice cream.
The other staff at the Speakeasy were incredibly friendly and attentive to our needs. Our rental was well equipped, clean, quiet and we felt totally safe staying here. It was a great place to launch our bike rides we had a great time there!"

Stayed with kids","If you're going to stay here be prepared for the pub next door. Rowdy crowd on Friday and Saturday nights. Pub goers don't mind parking in the reserved spot out back or hanging out in front of the room smoking either. Had to park down the street both Friday and Saturday night. Pub staff very inflexible when it comes to ordering food as I tried to order something to go and was informed by staffer that it's 9:02 and the kitchen closes at 9:00. This despite the pub being full of patrons and the cook clearly still preparing food. No breakfast available so they should drop one of the B's...
Now the good. Quiet and peaceful in the morning, and the coffee left by the host was most excellent. The one room is nice and clean. The little porch out back made for a perfect place to drink coffee and the trail head is right out the back door and across the street for a peaceful morning walk. Overall, I enjoyed the place, but was glad I had ear plugs for sleeping..."

Beverly and Justin were available with recommendations on where to look for information. At the end of the stay we had found every house we wanted to see, ancestor grave AND we canoed the Wabash from Lagro to Wabash.
The Riparian House was the perfect landing pad. We stayed busy all day and slept peacefully 9-10 hours each night! Windows open, listening to the birds and the rain.
We are in awe of the amount of work that was put in to the restoration of this historic building. The added touch of sliding stained glass windows and the beautiful repurposing of an original door- amazing. You just need to see it yourself.
Friendly folks in Lagro. While out walking they smile, greet you and are open to a chat. That must be why my dad was always so approachable to all. It all makes sense to me now."

When booking, remember there is a fun bar next door-outdoor music and patio- so there is some noise. We were there for it so it was no big deal for us.

Check in and check out process were super easy, great location for hiking and it's so nice having The 950 Speakeasy next door for drinks and dinner. It's very well decorated and the hosts left little extras like delicious coffee from a neat coffee house in Wabash. It's right on the Wabash River and the Wabash River Walk and parking in back so you don't have to park in front because it can be very busy with the restaurant next door. They also have a nice high-top table to sit at on the back porch and a nice picnic table. We will stay here again, especially since it's so close to hiking."

The bistro/pub right next door was great for us, but be aware that if people are outside there you will hear them inside the house. Don’t shy away from this place because of that, just know what it is and embrace it!"

Stayed a few nights","Space was very clean and cozy, and clearly a lot of thought and care was put into it's renovation. Checking in and out was easy (lockbox) and the instructions were simple. A couple of things to be aware of: there is a bar right next door with live music, and on Friday summer nights they have outdoor karaoke which is loud and lasts until at least 11pm. Because of that, there is a fair amount of street and motorcycle noise. We were only there on Friday and Saturday, so it might be better on weeknights. Also, people seem to have no qualms about walking through the yard, and the house is right next to the sidewalk so if you have the blinds open for natural light they can see right in - and they will look! If privacy is a priority for you, this is probably not the best place unless you want to keep the blinds closed at all times. Otherwise, we had a wonderful stay!"

Stayed a few nights","This little Airbnb did not disappoint! Tucked away in the sleepy town of Lagro, which is on the edge of rebuilding, was just the quiet I was looking for. Seriously it is so quiet & has a positive energy around it.
From the deck &/or the patio… Bike trail & Wabash River. The Speak Easy Bistro on one side & a great story teller on the other(He builds airplanes & sculpts)
A strong stone’s throw to a boat launch for canoes/kayaks. Just a 3 min. drive to Hanging Rock (Great story) & Salamonie Lake/Dam. Just 10min to Wabash for great local flavor shops, terrific coffee shop & fine dining options. (“Twenty” has amazing salmon)
The pics don’t do the inside justice. The details and craftsmanship makes it obvious how much love went into this place.
The outlets have USB ports- plenty of lighting, a beautiful drape for a little separation of bedroom, should you need it. The AC/Heating unit was SUPER quiet & worked to keep the place very comfortable.
I felt safe exercising early morning and walking late evenings Thur-Sunday.
The trees will keep you from catching the sunrise, so head over to the community boat launch /fire pit/big table if you want to get your day started with the sun. Those trees sure are wonderful at night, leaves blowing in the wind and the river & birds chiming in like an orchestra performance from nature.
I will be adding more dates to my calendar to visit again! (River shoes & beach towel on my list)
If you see Roger, two doors down, ask him about building planes- he can tell you stories for hours (Tell him Karrie sent you…for a story)"

All three of those cities are no more than 30-40 minutes away on easily driven roads. Our activities were at Huntington University. It is rustic but very homey with all amenities of a state park on adjacent property. Also, pets, even horses are welcome. We loved it!"

Welcoming our golden retriever was especially appreciated. My daughter is considering a return stay, maybe bringing her horses."

I noticed there were plenty of extra things for a traveler that might forget a toothbrush, razor or something. Very comfortable and quiet place. It's got a full kitchen. It's perfect for relaxing. It's located at the entrance of the Dora recreational area. We cooked out and built a fire in the pavilion at Dora during our first night. The next day we visited family in Wabash, I went to Lost Bridge East to play a few holes of disc golf at their 24 hole course. Later we had dinner and beer in Lagro at the Speakeasy Bistro."

We enjoyed waking up to the sunrise and enjoying Gods nature and hiking the Salamonie State Park. 🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻

We were in town for my step daughters wedding and it was 15 min from the venue. I did the cake and cupcakes for the wedding and did all the frosting/decorating there at the carriage house! Jennifer was great at responding and let us have a little extra time to check out because we ended up taking longer to clean up from the wedding. I also forgot my dress on the back of the bedroom door and she’s sending it to me!

We spent a lot of time playing games and reading on the couch looking out the panoramic living room windows. Amazing sunrise and sunset views! The trails were freshly cut for us, but they are grassy trails and the directions aren't the best so we highly recommend using AllTrails if you go exploring. If you have kids, check out the Salamonie Interpretive Center, it was $7 and included the wildflower garden and access to a huge beachfront of the resovoir. The kids could have spent the whole trip there! Very kid and pet friendly trip!"

Their property sits on a dead end street so there is little to no traffic as they are the last property.
Jen and Ben are such great hosts and have everything you would need for your stay. The barn is perfect for a little R&R. Does not smell like you are staying in a barn at all. There is a small fire pit and propane grill for your use too. They have chickens, ducks, a horse and a barn kitty. It’s about 20 minutes from Huntington or Wabash. We enjoyed everything about our stay and will be looking forward to returning. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

All the many reviews have essentially said this, which was our experience- its so peaceful. You are surrounded for miles by farm land. There is a great view of the horse paddock and fields and farms in the distance right out the window. For city people, its a real getaway. Its super cozy, with two bedrooms above the living area in a loft type space with sloping somewhat low ceilings.
The important stuff like A/C works great and seems new. Kitchen and baths were roomy, clean and nicely decorated. Wifi as others touched on is a little spotty but works. I wouldn't relying on it to try and work remotely though.
We also enjoyed being able to walk directly from the yard into trails. We tried two, one behind the owners house, which led quickly to near the reservoir but the trail -maybe due to rhe weather may have been better on horse back- it was blocked by standing water that was hard to traverse on foot and very muddy. The second trail from the yard directly behind the paddock was a much more pleasant walk- still through rough grass so you may need hiking shoes- but led around farm land and state forest that was very enjoyable.
The town of Lagro has a portion of a bike trail that is not yet complete that will connect to Wabash and further. (See Wabash river trail Facebook page).
As the listing mentions stores and restaurants are closed Sunday (and we discovered Mondays too). So get groceries either at Kroger or walmart or a single family run grocery all in Wabash and open Sundays.
The town of Wabash is small with alot of history and the downtown has alot of charm- and the town and county are working on ""revitalizing"" with new stores and restaurants. The old book store on the main street is an absolute must for anyone enjoying that. The resale boutique Bellazo was excellent with a much better ""curated"" selection of clothes than ""used"" sounds and trendy gifts and tshirts. The restaurant Harrys, a mile or so from downtown was, on Monday night, a great local spot with really excellent food and beer selection."

The outdoor area is beautiful and loved that they provided the grill so we could easily cook while outside! This was our first air bnb experience and I am so glad we did it! The views were amazing and the place was perfect! I'd highly suggest you book your quiet get away! The host was great about answering all my questions before hand too!

Jennifer did have in her tips after booking that most stores would close early on Saturday and likely be closed Sunday, but we didn’t expect all the local restaurants downtown to be closed, so that is something to be aware of in planning.

It was also pretty close to where the in-laws live so it was a great location for us. Although the hosts live on the property, we didn't feel like we were being watched and it was very peaceful there.
We did hear some of the animals during the night, but it wasn't overwhelming. The only other ""complaint"" we had was that the water is very iron-y(?). So when you showered you could smell it pretty strongly. They did provide bottled water and water for the coffee which was an awesome touch! We will definitely be back next time we are in town!"

Downstairs was the kitchen, bathroom and group space , upstairs were the two bedrooms. All areas were made to feel comfortable , just like we were at home. Just an FYI, the tv is upstairs in one of the bedrooms so if you’re looking forward to a group movie night, use your laptop. Jen was a great host, always there to answer questions but not intrusive. I’ve stayed at owner occupied rentals before and always felt watched , this was not the case. We would love to come back when it wasn’t raining to explore the state park.

Stayed a few nights","The Carriage House was perfect for us! Everything was so clean and Jennifer had absolutely EVERYTHING we needed and more, including an electric hand mixer! Her tips about what shops to visit were spot on and her communication with us was fantastic. I would definitely recommend anyone to stay here. It was the perfect, quiet, relaxing getaway for my mother and me."

Stayed with kids","The Carriage House was a beautiful little weekend getaway for my family. Clean, nicely finished, recently updated, beautiful views. Nice touches such as coffee, tea, condiments, etc. We made a big pot of chili and made great use of the kitchen, which was stocked with all the cookware you could need, built a fire in the firepit, made s'mores, and played board games.
Would definitely consider returning."

And to allay any fears for future guests; there are no horse odors in the apartment. (The #1 question I was asked when I told people we were retreating to a horse barn for our anniversary.)
I highly recommend Jennifer's Place to anyone looking to slow down and relax for a bit. We surely did!
Best regards!

Stayed a few nights",Family of 4 with two teenage girls and a dog had nice and peaceful fall break getaway for two nights. The place is very clean and organized. The kitchen is well equipped and the bathroom was good size. My girls loved seeing the horses every morning. There are several state parks and nature preserves in less than 10 min driving distance. We enjoyed their trails during the day and played board games that were in the residence at night. We had relaxing and quality family time.

Stayed with kids","Kyle and Aubrey’s apartment was an incredible find for us! It was so cute, and so clean, and so close ￼to everything we needed!! The decor and upgrades were beautifully done. Even the bedding enhanced the clean, modern farmhouse style. The location was fantastic! We could easily walk to breakfast, lunch, and dinner ￼and do some shopping in the quaint little shops downtown￼. Kyle and Aubrey were extremely accommodating hosts; ￼ easy to work with and contact. They thought of everything in the way of amenities and provided all you would need and then some! The large kitchen was great for family meals and we all appreciated the well-stocked “coffee bar” on the counter every morning! It truly felt like being home (away from home). They even had brochures about Wabash and things to do in the area! It was just wonderful. Because we have extended family in the area, we will be making regular trips and are looking forward to staying there again, and again, and again!!"

We were celebrating my son’s birthday and they agreed to hang some small decorations and had balloons blown up and around the house when we arrived. They even asked what colors we would like the balloons to be.

PROS:
- PERFECT location. Maybe a 2-3 minute walk to Honeywell Center & an even shorter walk to Dye's Bar & Grille. Very short walk to everything downtown Wabash.
- House was immaculate. Very clean & organized.
- Easy, free street parking right in front. Was perfect!
CONS:
- The only complaint I have is the noise. We could hear the upstairs tenant walking around for hours in the middle of the night. It was loud enough that it kept waking us up so we hardly slept. That said, it wouldn't prevent us from staying here again. I just thought I'd bring it up especially if you're a light sleeper. Just bring ear plugs! :)"

All of the beds are very comfortable, the towels see soft and fluffy, there are plenty of drawers, cabinets and closets for everything!! The living room sofas and chairs are big and soft, the huge-screened TV is great!! There are a few steps you must climb to get to the front porch, but after you are in the door, the entire unit is on one level. The hosts are quick with communication replies and answers to questions. We barely even heard the guests in the upstairs unit, the house is well insulated and the AC and Heater work perfectly.

Due to an unfortunate incident on our end, we were only able to stay a couple of hours and didn't get to complete our stay as planned, but in the short time we were there, we really enjoyed this little goat shed turned mini home. Listening to the creek babble while sitting outside was our favorite part.

The place was warm and relaxing and the area is quiet and peaceful. I appreciated the hosts always going the extra mile and making sure my stay was as enjoyable as possible. The shed really was a truly unique experience that I’d love to have again!

Stayed one night","ANOTHER VERY MEMORABLE, completely enjoyable AirB&B experience less than two hours from home, in my own home state!
I didn’t have much time to read about this one ahead of time, but I booked it because I read “shed.” I’ve overnighted in just about every situation, but never a shed.
What I had for just one night was a very cozy, peaceful, and extremely enjoyable escape.
Thank you, Kurt & Heidi, for taking care of every detail and providing a haste-free experience in a lovely setting."

If you want a peaceful, cozy spot to tuck away from the buzz of everyday life, you can't go wrong with Kurt and Heidi's place. It's close to town amenities yet located in country surroundings within a quiet neighborhood we felt safe in. We weren't sure what the compost toilet experience would be like, but it was super user-friendly, no pun intended, and only added to the experience. It's clear Kurt and Heidi put thoughtful effort into making their place and our stay special. Everything was as advertised and then some."

Stayed a few nights","The Shed Retreat is a perfect and cozy retreat to get away from the business of the world and just rest and humble yourself in nature. The cats are super friendly and greeted me each morning which was very sweet. Unfortunately, my stay called for wet and cold weather but I think the fireplace and the extended grounds close to the creek would've been a great place to enjoy the surroundings and reflect on life. I really enjoyed the photo book detailing how the shed came to be, as well as perusing the several games and books inside the cabinet. This would be a great getaway for couples as there were several books/games available to re-get to know each other and share with each other. I would definitely recommend this location for couples. It's also close to Warsaw which has a cute lake and stores to explore."

A simple getaway, thoughtful hosts, a unique setting, and absolutely adorable accommodations. This visit called for poor weather, so Kurt and Heidi set up the garage with some indoor games for the kids and I to play so we wouldn’t be bored—I call that definitely going above and beyond. It was well appreciated and they truly are the sweetest hosts. 100% would recommend. Also to note is the adorable downtown area, library with community garden, several Little Free Libraries in the area, and a bomb thrift shop that my daughter and I discovered. ♥️"

Stayed a few nights","We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Shed Retreat. It was evident that a lot of care and thought has gone into making this little space as comfortable and welcoming as possible. For us, this stay checked all of our boxes, particularly being simple and affordable. The bathroom situation (toilet and shower outdoors) was no problem for us, and even added to the fun of our stay. I found myself especially appreciative of the house robes and shoes provided for our use - they made walking to the bathroom or using the shower a lot cleaner and easier than it could have been. Although we didn't meet Kurt and Heidi face to face during our stay, they were always quick to respond to questions, and available to help. I could certainly see us staying at the Shed Retreat again in the future. As parents it was the perfect little space to get away and reconnect for a couple days, without breaking the budget. We really appreciate what Kurt and Heidi have done with the space, and love that they've made it available."

A very calm and friendly kitten around makes a greater feeling and morning wake-up call from roosters. The place is cozy and perfectly cleaned by Kurt & Heidi. With provided few kitchens and game accessories it will be great fun.
As the trail leads into a nice creek in the backyard, it will be a great time to spend around in the entire day time in the woods. Definitely love to visit this place again. Bottom line, if you are a true lover of nature then this is the PERFECT PLACE for your pleasant stay....!!!!!"

Stayed one night","What a cute and cozy little apartment in a peaceful setting, complete with a couple of really friendly cats and lovely chickens! The shed itself was warm, inviting and smelled wonderful inside. The hosts leave you to your own devices and honor privacy, while still responding quickly to communication through the Airbnb app. The toilet arrangement (a camp toilet outside and one you can take inside) most certainly isn’t for everyone. It was a little hard to handle at times, but certainly didn’t take away from my total experience. Also, because of the time of year, the outdoor shower on premises was not available (there are showers available at a local rec facility for a modest fee). If you can put up with these minor points, I would enthusiastically recommend this location to anyone visiting this area!"

I felt tranquility and peacefulness listening to the creek babble as I took in the vibrant Fall colors. The crunch of the leaves a few steps down a cute wooded path made me reminisce my childhood growing up in Michigan. At night, the fire pit area was illuminated and beautified by adorning lights- like fireflies of summers past. The kittens sat in my lap purring me awake the next morning while enjoying coffee out front on the deck. Kurt and Heidi hit the nail on the head with the details of my new escape. They pray for those who find their way to the Shed. And pray for you while you’re here. And my soul could feel their healing words. Thank you so much for sharing this sacred space."

Stayed a few nights","The Shed Retreat is a little room in a beautifully peaceful setting out in the country. It's kind of a cross between a guest cottage and camping. The Shed itself is relatively close to Kurt & Heidi's house, yet is situated so it's surprisingly secluded and private, so it really IS perfect for a retreat.
Personally, my favorite part about my 2-night stay was probably just sitting inside, reading, writing, and coloring, with the windows open to let in the cool, fresh air. I also enjoyed an evening campfire (ate too many s'mores), walking down to the creek and the green grassy area (early a.m. squats & lunges), gathering fresh eggs, and practicing some ""kitten yoga"" (didn't know that was a thing, but the little grey guy thought I should try it).
The outside restroom is relatively convenient, clean, and comfortable. I feel that guests should be aware in advance that they are asked to do some of their own ""maintenance"" of the camp toilet, and that was not at all a problem for me.
Heidi and Kurt went out of their way to help me with a problem that came up (which was not related to their property), and I'm so appreciative of their assistance.
I didn't experience much in the town of North Manchester, but I did visit the History Museum, which was interesting and informative, and the Main View restaurant where I had a delicious lunch.
I hope I get an opportunity to stay at The Shed sometime in the future!"

Stayed a few nights","I had a terrific experience at the Shed. Went looking for a weekend away to enjoy the pleasures of camping but also have a bed and room at night. My kind of glamping! Kurt and Heidi were so thoughtful - welcome cupcakes and a note on the bed when I arrived. The room was comfortable and adequate. Firewood ready for a campfire. Instructions and anything I needed to know was communicated well. They were sweet to say hello and visit but also considerate to give me space. Lots of options for simple fun. I checked out the fitness center one day. Walked downtown North Manchester for ice cream another day. And enjoyed reading and several cups of coffee by the fire. The chickens, fresh eggs and adorable kitties just added to the charm of the experience. Price was right and well worth it! Thanks Kurt and Heidi!"

They have everything here that you need to make your stay enjoyable. We are planning our next trip in the fall some time. We’d love to come back and enjoy this place longer and get to interact with the owners more. The cats, as everybody mentions, were just an added bonus!"

Kurt and Heidi have a beautiful property and yes, there were kitties! The kitties were such an added blessing and so adorable. The shed was stunning, as was the yard and little creek in the back! We have never been camping before and this little glamping getaway was a perfect introduction, featuring an outdoor toilet and shower. The toilet was easy to use and very clean, as was the shower. This was everything we were looking for and we cant wait to be back!"

I went kayaking, played with the kittens, napped in the hammock, had coffee under the trees, listened to the silence and the sound of the River and rode a bike into town for dinner. It was a gift and a blessing in many ways. I highly recommend the space and the hosts."

Stayed one night","If you like ""glamping"" this place is for you! It was an oasis of serenity and beauty, nestled in a sweet garden of hostas and shady trees. The chickens are near the parking and their sweet soft noises greeted us as we entered the very short path to the beautiful converted goat shed. If those goats could see this place now, they'd be in awe of it! The decor inside is darling and it had everything you needed, including A/C, electricity, a nice comfy chair, coffee table and love seat sitting area. The large bed was extremely comfy and the pillows were perfect. Rubber slippers, towels and bathrobes were provided near the back door for use in the very private outside shower. There is a camp toilet which along with the foot pump sink is part of the ""glamping"" experience that made this a fun adventure. From the cupcakes that greeted us to the fresh eggs we cooked in the barn for breakfast, we couldn't have asked for more! Oh! We also were over the moon visiting with the sweetest momma cat and her five adorable kittens!!! If we could have adopted any, we would have begged for at least two. It will be one of the best places you can find to stay in Indiana and I guarantee you won't want to leave!"

The hosts are beyond friendly, the cats (and now kittens as well!!!) are just adorable and so playful, and the setting is peaceful and just enough off of the beaten path to feel sort of camp-y in a very glamp-y way. My 15 year old daughter didn’t want to come previously because of the outdoor restroom (🙄😐). She, for some reason, chose to come this time and now said she will come every chance she gets. If this place can win over the pickiest teenager in the world, I’d say it’s whatever level comes after “winner”! 😋😉💕"

There were plenty of blankets to get cozy, all the amenities were provided, and I found the outdoor bathroom a fun little adventure. If you’re not a fan of cats, though, this may not be the spot for you. There are a ton of friendly cats (and kittens) that accompanied me throughout my time outside. I found them endearing, but someone afraid (or allergic) to cats may find that less than relaxing. Definitely would recommend this spot!!"

There were so many small touches that made the trip extra special too--like a welcome note with homemade cookies and a note on a book of questions inviting us to get to know each other better. My wife fell in love with Nala, one of their kittens, who was a great hammock snuggle buddy! Kurt was especially attentive and communicative--transporting our farmer's market goods (There is a wonderful farmer's market in town on Saturday mornings!) for us when he noticed that we had bought a little too much to carry back with us to the shed with the bikes that he lent us. We also really enjoyed, and recommend, the kayaking trip! (This would be at a small extra cost and includes kayaks, paddles, life jackets and drop off / pick up.) It was all just what we needed to get away from everyday life!"

Stayed a few nights","This place was an amazing retreat into nature and simple living. If you need to clear your mind, get in touch with yourself, focus on art or meditation; this is the place for you. The hosts were so kind and the amenities were unbelievable for the price and quality of the place. I recommend bringing your own grill and food to cook on site. There is a great farmers market in the town on Saturday morning, but otherwise healthy convenient food choices are slim. The camping toilet is really the only rustic part of the amenities so you should be prepared to take care of your own waste. There are some beautiful state parks in the area you can drive to for hiking trails and nature time. The best part by far was meeting the hosts and going on the kayak adventure; they provided the kayak and the drop-off/pick-up. The river was beautiful with a good mix of challenging and relaxing sections which made for a perfect true adventure. Thank you so much Heidi and Kurt for the love and kindness you put into this retreat."

We got fresh, warm eggs from the chicken coop for breakfast and had a great fire surrounded by fairy lights. We couldn’t have chosen a better place to spend our anniversary :)"

We enjoyed a fire and tenting as if we were camping, yet with the comfort of a stylish and comfortable place to sleep.

Although we were on their property, we could not see any of their activity most of the time. They immediately responded to any questions we had and were very helpful about area information. We definitely plan to go back! We hope to make it a traditional trip."

The house location in Wabash is unbeatable. There is a playground across the street, Downtown is walking distance, as well as the best Mexican restaurant I've ever been to. A paved Riverwalk trail is close by. There's also a gas station and car wash nearby, and grocery stores are within 10 minutes. If you're visiting Wabash, this is definitely the place to stay."

One note about the washer. It says press and hold to start but that didn't work. I ended up sort of tapping on it until it started. Also, check that the water to the washer is turned on because once I finally got the washer to start, it came up with an error of LF and I found out the water to the washer was barely turned on."

That forewarning in place—this place is flipping amazing, serene, recharging. The bed was super comfortable. Everything seemed very clean. I had my breakfast on the porch and I’ll never forget the peaceful feeling. Many waterfalls nearby; driving a few minutes. Host is very sweet and fast to respond. Pretty sure if I saw this price lowered (it was $120 when I booked, maybe that’s no issue for some) I’d accommodate the smelly water AND if I were forewarned I’d bring big wash wipes. Idk. I’m extremely happy I went there but I’d only do it for cheaper now."

We particularly enjoyed the deck overlooking the horse pasture! Our host was very responsive and everything came together for a relaxing couple of days in Hoosier-land. We also went on hikes at the recommended nearby locations and found them well worth the effort. All in all, a very enjoyable stay."

Everything was great ! My first experience in a tiny house! They do have well water. But I did not mind the little odor. Brought back good childhood memories. I was very comfortable in the bed.
Keishia is wonderful!
I’m hoping to send my daughter for a weekend getaway. She would enjoy it very much.. I also want to mention the deck was so relaxing and watching the horses. You won’t make a mistake if you get this. It’s affordable nice and does not miss anything. 💕 oh, and one nice thing a couple miles away is a beautiful state forest."

Keishia was very communicative and the arrival/check-in process was super easy. The accommodations are adorable and they did an impressive job fitting all the basics into the renovated grain silo. The ranch is beautiful but they do not allow you to go anywhere beyond the immediate area of the Bunkhouse. We would love to come again and get there a little earlier next time so we could have a fire and spend more time on the porch before the bugs come out. If you are a late riser (like us), make sure you note the 10am check-out."

We were also able to enjoy a night in at the Bunkhouse sitting by the fire and watching the horses. Finding the place was easy as well - you can see the silo just inside the ranch entrance from the main road intersection. The living quarters were quaint and adorable and yet fit all of the amenities and comforts of home away from home. Would stay again and highly recommend this experience!

Stayed a few nights","My fiancée and I wanted a place where we could escape from the world. When I found Love’s Hideaway Ranch, I felt like I hit the jack-pot. It's the middle of a quiet countryside in rural Indiana, and it's a tiny-home: perfect for us because it had everything we needed to be comfortable for 4 nights while also being much more affordable than a larger house would’ve been (a full kitchen and bathroom indoors, a cozy living room with a TV, and a loft with a comfortable bed).
We found that it felt even roomier inside than the photos led on. The kitchen, living room, bathroom, and loft were more than big enough for the two of us. The deck outside was a great touch, and made “your” space feel that much bigger, while maintaining the cozy, tiny-home feel.
Lagro is just 5 min up the road for any convenience store needs, and should you need anything more than that, Wabash is 15 min further.
All in all, Love’s Hideaway Ranch was true to its name: a place to hide away from the world."

Stayed a few nights","Our stay was quiet and relaxing. We spent our days at local disc golf courses; there are several very good ones within a 25-mile radius. For our evenings, we know that streaming videos out on country internet service is not as seamless as it is in the city, so we brought in a small table to play card/board games. We had just enough room to set it up, and it made for some great evenings of Everdell, Terraforming Mars, and even some Skip-Bo.
If you're looking for wide-open, spacious rooms and excellent video streaming services, this isn't the cabin for you. But if you're looking for quiet, private, cozy, easy check-in and parking, and lots of nearby outdoor amenities (hiking, biking, disc golf, sight seeing), you'll love it here!"

This is in the listing too but if you are tall, be careful in the loft as it is low clearing with a ceiling fan.

I am 5'5"" and I did not need to duck in the main part of the loft, but anyone taller than that will need to. It is a fairly big loft with a very comfortable bed. The property has very nice walking paths through the trees (bring some boots if it has rained recently).

Stayed a few nights","Such a wonderful property and a unique stay! We loved all of the following: the forest trails to explore (on my runs I came across 5 deer), the cute farm animals (the cows seem to enjoy us watching them), the SUPER comfortable bed, the excellent heating/cooling, the close proximity to natural attractions (so many waterfalls), and the kind extras (such as providing new dry firewood after rain soaked the previous batch and an eclectic selection of movies on DVD). We had such a relaxing getaway as a couple and felt renewed for our return home.
A few notes so others can be aware (and none of these are deal-breakers...we definitely plan to return). This is a remote location, so you will have to deal with some of what that entails, including:
slower than usual wi-fi connections over satellite - (Netflix will still stream, but may occasionally be blurry or pause)
well water - the smell takes some getting used to after taking a shower or flushing the toilet, but the filter on the sink faucet improves the taste.
We also really appreciated that the property allows dogs (for a deposit). Be warned though if you have a small dog that they could easily slide underneath the railing and drop one floor to the ground. Ours jumped off the bed, slid some on the wood floor, and nearly fell off the edge. It is not the safest property for a small dog (or child), so if you book this, be prepared to move things around and possibly setup some luggage blockades to make it safe.
These are all minor inconveniences, but really this property rocks, and is one of the most unique AirBNBs we have stayed at. It is tiny, but featured-filled, feels like the middle of nowhere (but is close to waterfalls, Lagro, and Wabash), has fantastic farm-life and trails, and has a kind host who is committed to making your stay convenient and comfortable.

One thing if you are claustrophobic and there are two of you, your head is very close to the ceiling one side of the bed. I would suggest to rent her gorgeous cabin on the same property, because it was the best retreat one could have."

Keishia was always available, but also gave you space- you could message anytime, and she would check in with us at the beginning and end of our stay. Waking up and spending the afternoons on the beautiful porch watching the cows right next to your space was fun and so relaxing. We were able to walk the trails as well with our dog and got to see the beautiful woods/fields on her property. Everything we needed was there, we ended up packing more than what we needed. Keishia provided clean towels, coffee, firewood for the pit that is right on the porch outside, and helpful notes around the house if you had questions. The loft bedroom was gorgeous and all the work that had to be done to construct this place must pay off. We will definitely be coming back."

Stayed a few nights","The silo is absolutely adorable, and located in a lovely, rural settimg. The cute cows mooing outside the window are the icing on the cake. The trails on the property were dotted with flowers when we were there, and the scents along the trail kept our rescue dog very involved in our explorations! We were lucky enough to be there when a brief thunderstorm rolled through, and the sounds inside the silo were incredible!
Keishia was very sweet, willing to accomodate our larger dog (we asked before booking), and communicated incredibly well before and throughout our stay.
On a practical level:
Check-in with the lock box was convenient (but be careful not to drop the key down between the door and the deck, as I almost did!)
The air conditioning works very well, and kept the small space cool even when the heat index was near 100
The washer/dryer combo is efficient and well located.
The shower pressure is great, but if you're a bit squishy (like me and my husband), you may find it a bit of a squeeze compared to what you're used to at home. Not a big deal, but something to be aware of. Shampoo, conditioner, body wash, hand soap,lots of nice quality toilet paper, a clean toilet, and a large stack of towels help make the bathroom practical and comfy.
Everything was very clean, well organized, and the kitchen had all the essentials for cooking a meal (including a pizza cutter, cookie sheets, and a variety of spoons, spatulas and pancake flippers). I only regret that I didn't bring stuff to make cookies in the cute little oven! Both a Keurig and traditional coffee pot are available and there were coffee filters on the shelf when we were there.
We highly recommend this property to anyone who needs a little quiet time away, or wants to be near Wabash, but in a more rural setting, or who just wants to try out tiny house living to see if it's right for them! If you're a fan of quiet nature settings, gorgeous sunsets, and happy neighborly cows, this is the place to be."

The property itself was fun to hike. My son loved the deer stand that felt more like a cool tree house to him. Keisha was very responsive and helpful. There was a lot to see nearby too. The laminated map with locations and brief descriptions of waterfalls nearby was super helpful. We got a lot of hiking in and saw 5 waterfalls all within a 15 minute drive or less. Would definitely recommend!"

After being stuck in my tiny condo in the city for most of covid, I needed to drive cross country and wanted to get some fresh air and peace of mind. The grounds are beautiful and there are cows! Sitting on the (huge) deck was exactly the feeling I was craving.
I brought my cat (not ideal but couldn’t be helped!) and she enjoyed the stairs and watching the cows out the window. WiFi also worked great as I was working during the week.
Thank you so much, Keishia!!"

• While dog friendly, there’s an electric fence directly behind the silo. This made us nervous with our small dog that sometimes is able to slip out of her harness.
• During hunting season it was suggested to wear reflective gear while hiking on the premises to avoid danger."

I recommend checking out Harvey Hinkelmeyers for takeout pizza or Market Street Grill in Wabash. Keisha is a great host, very quick to respond to communication, and added many thoughtful touches to the place like slippers, firewood, and a candle. It was dog friendly, but I wouldn’t recommend it for a puppy because of the stairs and ledge to the bedroom."

There are cattle on site as well as hiking, and I hadn’t realized before arriving; both were great surprises. The internet isn’t great, and I had a hard time using the Roku because of it, but the wireless worked better for me on my iPad. Also, if you’re staying in the winter, I definitely recommend slippers. The floor gets mighty chilly, but... it’s a silo... in Indiana... in the winter, so I expected it.

We loved the screened in back porch - perfect weather to sit out there in morning to have coffee and start the day and in the evening to wind down. Yard was well maintained - a nice driveway to park in off the street. Neighborhood was nice and quiet. This property deserves a ten out of ten rating !!!!"

Stayed one night","A compassionate host would have made a huge difference for me and my sister. We were on a sister's trip to make memories since my sister is disable, walks with a cane, and has debilitating side effects from battling cancer. Aware that the airbnb was non-smoking, I wanted to be considerate and respectful so I reached out to Beverly to make sure it would be okay for my disable sister to smoke outside on the porch, screened in patio, or even in the yard. Beverly was quite rude in her response by saying that IF SHE MUST smoke that she could only stand and smoke in the driveway or in my car. She proceeded to tell us how much she had spent on the renovation. Personally, I don't care how much it cost. All she needed to say was politely no or that my sister could smoke outside. Again, you don't know who is on the other end ... so don't assume. Additionally, we are charged a cleaning fee; thus, we didn't squeegee the shower for you to 'make the host' happy. We won't be back!!"
