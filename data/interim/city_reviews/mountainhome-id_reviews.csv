Stayed with kids","This house is really cute and in a great neighborhood. We were able to take walks in the evening and it's right near town which makes it really convenient. It has a lot of charm while also having every convenience needed. My kids were totally enthralled by the skylights which made it bright and cozy for relaxing.
Butch was an excellent host - he responded quickly to questions in a friendly and helpful way. We would recommend this property to anyone in a heartbeat and will stay again when we're in the area."

Stayed with kids",The home was fantastic! Very close to family. Well stocked kitchen. Large sitting area. Lots of space. Had an issue with checking in and was not able to get in until 2 hours after check-in time. Partially because the lock was not working properly and partially because the door was a little stuck and we needed to push harder. Host and Housekeeper were both unavailable by phone and text. We didn't get a response until much later. Luckily we had family close by. All in all we had a lovely time and would most likely stay again because it's so close to family and the space is great.

Group trip","Our stay was pleasant. The house is in a great location and has more than enough room for a large family. The kitchen had a lot of space & had everything we needed. The additional family room is great and perfect for gathering.
The heat & cooling are easy to use and adjust, and disperses throughout the house evenly (upstairs isn’t hot while downstairs is cool). The fire places are a great touch!
The wifi was an issue. My hubby needed to get some work done on Friday & finally gave up and went somewhere else. The signal was really weak & slow. I don’t know if that can be remedied, some places are just that way.
It really is a great place, very clean, and really just few, easy tweaks would make it a five star stay. Butch does well communicating and was quick to pop over when we had a small problem gaining access (user error on our part)."

Stayed with kids","We were in town visiting our son and found the home clean and inviting. The decor is simple and free of clutter, the beds are very comfortable, the kitchen had everything we needed to cook our meals, and the pantry is a terrific size to hold all your groceries for your stay.
We enjoyed how close the house was located to grocery stores and spots to eat in town. We enjoyed the variety offered by the food trucks (corner of American Legion Blvd and S 18th E St.) and tasty food at the Manhattan Cafe (E Jackson St).
It is located within 20 minutes from the Mountain Home AFB, 1 hour from Boise or Twin Falls, and Meridian so there is plenty close by to do!
Wayne was very responsive and great to book with. We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend this cute gem for your next trip!"

The bedrooms gave us privacy and were spacious and clean. Most importantly, we rested and had a great stay.

Stayed with kids","As you pull into the driveway, you are on camera. There are 5 cameras on the house so at any moment you are outside, you are being seen and heard. I understand this may be for security but it is a little uncomfortable being watched the whole time. The location of the house is great, close to downtown. The house is clean and the bathrooms are awesome. There is an ant problem in the kitchen and the host is aware. The couch is comfy. Plenty of blankets and towels. Checkout is earlier than most, 10:00 am. There is a 10:00pm ""quiet time"" rule. As an adult, we should not have to receive an email telling us that some of our family is outside talking loud. There were no parties, no music. Airbnbs are typically used for out of town guests attending activities so there will be lots of movements, even after 10:00 pm."

Alex was able to provide us with a cozy, clean, modern space that suited us perfectly. It is within 5 minutes of everything- grocery, coffee, Walmart, and the interstate.
10/10 Recommend. Thanks Alex!"

Stayed a few nights",The location and surrounding apartments are quite disconcerting and we were quite concerned when we drove up and saw the location and surroundings. An owner can't affect how those other renters/owners treat their property but be prepared. We were worried about the security of our cars but it turned out we were worried for no reason. Once you are inside the unit it is quite pleasant. The owners have quite a flare for decorating and has made wonderful use of some vintage furnishings to create a Bohemian affect in the decor. The beds are EXTREMELY comfortable! I made an error in my reservation and the owner pointed it out and worked with me to resolve in a fair manner. Beware that there are stairs in this unit and they are quite steep and were difficult for my aged parents.

I normally strip beds anyways but being on vacation and paying as much as we did don’t feel that is fair being required to do all that. Bed was very comfortable. She is very accommodating.

Minor:
Make sure to pay attention to room description. There's nearly duplicate photos of the master bedroom with slightly different bedding. If you weren't careful you'd think there's two large bedrooms and a bunk room. It's actually 1 nice master bedroom and a bunk room. Regardless we caught this before booking and were happy with the stay."

She was willing to go out of her way to make the arrival and stay as smooth as possible, doing more than making sure the doors opened whenever I arrived with the keycode (which was flawless) and having the home ready for relaxation, or remote work via WiFi, or preparing a meal in the kitchen. She communicated easily and quickly before arriving, and followed up while I was there. I cannot imagine what more she could have done to meaningfully improve the stay."

Stayed with a pet","Sadly, due to a delay on my end over car issues, I couldn't leave home early enough the day of my reservation to make it for my stay at Amber's place.
I can, however, say that the place looked so perfect for my needs, and that Amber was a thoughtful host communicated very well.
When I messaged later to let her know that the place wasn't being used, she replied instantly and was super nice.
I am a host myself, and knowing the policies and how hard it is on a host to have someone block a date then cancel last minute, I didn't ask for any kind of refund, especially since it was entirely my fault. So, it was a nice surprise when Amber refunded the cleaning fee.
I would definitely book Amber's place again in the future, as it is perfectly located for a night's rest off the freeway and with space to stretch out"

Our weiner dogs enjoyed the fenced back yard and we could tell our hosts continue to make little upgrades as they can. Would gladly stay there again. We enjoyed a bottle of wine upon arrival and had bagels waiting for breakfast as well."

Amber is also a great host. Shes was very responsive and we even had some local recommendations ready to go when we arrived.
Two thumbs way up!"

The amount of things they provided like towels, shower essentials, dishes, a hair dryer ensured we had everything we needed for our trip! Overall a very nice stay, a good night's sleep, and would stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","This home was perfect for our holiday stay near family in Mtn. Home. It was helpful that it was pet friendly and had several beds in the bunk room. The internet wasn’t working, and we were unable to use the tv’s. But that wasn’t important for our stay. There is no garage, just a carport, and no dishwasher. That wasn’t a problem and not necessary for our stay, just something to consider. We were grateful we could stay in this home. Our experience was positive."

Stayed a few nights","A wonderful place to stay in a safe and friendly area!!
Normally, I avoid booking places with no reviews. I decided to give Amber's place a shot. I am sure glad I did.
The home is on a nice and quiet road with excellent neighbors. It's safe (close to an elementary school and library) and feels like home. The streets are wide with sidewalks everywhere to walk safely on. The neighborhood is perfect for morning and afternoon walks.
Getting to the house is easily accessible from the main road and only 10 minutes or less from the highway. The shops that you need are all withing 10 minutes (Walmart, grocery store, quaint little restaurants, gift shops, etc.)
As we entered the house, the first thing we noticed was how room it was because of just the right sized furniture that was very, very comfortable (I fell asleep one night on the bean bag and felt great in the morning!). The living room had every thing you need.
The kitchen was thoughtfully setup. Coffee available in three fashions: Standard drip, Keurig cups, AND a French Press (Yipee!!!). Fresh coffee grounds were stocked along with everything I needed for a fresh cup of coffee in the morning.
That coffee was great with the breakfast that Amber provided (bagels, cream cheese, etc.). Nice touch, Amber! This made our first morning comfortable and we did not have to rush out to get something to eat.
When we decided to bring food to the house, we had every thing we needed to eat and also prepare our meals. The air fryer was the perfect appliance to warm up our food. Microwaves just ruin food. Warming in an air fryer is quick and makes the food taste so much better.
When it was time to rest, the beds were comfortable, inviting, and warm. Since the nights were cold outside, I looked forward to curling up inside the blankets of the bed to have a great night rest.
As for Amber as our host, she was amazing! She made sure we had everything we needed prior to our arrival. She also communicated quickly, clearly, and completely. I've stayed at a lot of AirBnBs (look at my profile). I can say that Amber is one of the best hosts I've communicated with.
We will certainly stay here again if we return to Mountain Home.
Thanks, Amber."

The host and co-host communication was superb and they helped us extend our stay, replenish supplies and answer a few questions throughout.
Thank You for the providing a place to stay that was as comfortable as home with a sense of a retreat."

Huge kitchen with everything one needs for cooking. We all enjoyed the games and the hot tub was the perfect ending to each day. Robbie communicated everything we needed to know well ahead of check in and also touched base with us throughout our stay. Can’t recommend this property enough."

Stayed with kids","I rented this house for my siblings and they had a great stay at Robbie's place! They were a large group (5 adults and 2 kids) and they had plenty of room. The kids really enjoyed the arcade games and the basket ball hoop. We didn't have a chance to use the hot tub or grill. The beds were comfortable and the bedding was fresh. Although all the towels had a sight mildew smell. (That could possibly be from the checkout instructions that ask you to start a load of laundry before you leave. My family left at 8am. I have no idea when the cleaning crew arrived to finish the laundry. The wet towels could have been sitting in the washer for hours.) 🤷🏻‍♀️
Over all a great place to stay!"

Plenty of seating in the kitchen/living area plus in the family room. The kitchen is set up so well and has everything you need to prepare meals. We loved that all the bedrooms, family room and living room had throw blankets to keep everyone cozy. Great location and we walked to the park with our little ones, drove downtown for breakfast and grocery shopping was just minutes away. If we are in the area again we will definitely return to this spot."

Group trip","The host communicated well. The house was very clean. The house has a lot of off-the-street parking. We fit two mini vans, two small sedans, and one very large pickup. The hot tub was clean. One of the bedrooms doubles as the laundry room and had a slight fabric softener scent, though it did not bother the one sleeping in it.
I would recommend staying here, and I will book this BNB again for the same reunion next year."

Stayed with a pet","Super cute house, competitively priced, and great for all ages! Loved having a fenced yard for our dog; he enjoyed it even though it was mostly rock. We had so much fun exploring all the amenities and even considered extending our stay just to hangout here. I could rave about the home owner and the fun quirks of the house, but just to fit Air BNB’s word minimum: the game room was a blast, we played pool & Pac-Man until we were too tired to stand upright. We enjoyed drinks around the fire & a quick dip in the hot tub before bed. The beds were comfy, cozy & we battled over who got to stay in which themed room. Mega appreciation for the labeled cabinets, especially the “hide & seek” spot. My husband promptly hid in it to scare the daylights out of his brother — thank you for the laughs & the many photo opportunities. The homeowner was a doll, they really went above and beyond with the s’mores supplies. Definitely want to come back to see what else they do with the place! :)"

Incredibly kind and understanding, extremely responsive over many conversations to ensure our timing was right, flexible in our arrangements and planning, willing to answer any questions and proactive in ensuring we were comfortable in this great home. Looks just like the pictures but even more cute in person, fully stocked kitchen and bathrooms and laundry, snacks to hold you over until you get to the grocery stores less than 5 min away, restaurants and coffee and donut shops minutes away. Plenty of entertainment in the house including board games, pool table, darts, arcade games. Bedrooms are all super comfortable and themed plus fans for white noise, Super cute little closet nook kids to play or read, and large couches for extra sleepers or gatherings to watch tv on the Rokus. Quiet street but block away from the heart of town. You’ll love this place."

The bathrooms (one upstairs, one downstairs) were equally clean and supplied with plenty of towels and washcloths, as well as soap, shampoo, and conditioner. We enjoyed the large downstairs game room so much we didn't even turn on any of the TVs during the day and two nights we stayed. We did soak in the backyard hot tub our first night, appreciating its oasis of warmth in the chilly air.
Janie's kitchen was well stocked with all we needed to cook each of our five meals there. It featured plenty of counter space as well as extra cupboard areas to store any food or items we brought in. The refrigerator and freezer had plenty of room and were clean and cold. We were grateful for the Pur filtered water inside, too!
We had no issues with anything during our stay, and I'm confident that if we had, Janie would have taken care of them quickly."

The house was fully stocked for our week’s stay and the BBQ grill was effortless. As natives to Mountain Home the location was more ideal than we expected and so close to everything we needed. More importantly, Floyd was very communicative and accommodating and even checked in with us after a rainstorm to make sure everything was ok. Though we were sad to check out of this place, we will definitely be hoping to reserve this exceptionally convenient property on our next trip to Mountain Home."

Nice quiet neighborhood, conveniently located in town where you can walk to local spots and a quick ride to the express way if you're going to Boise or the Airforce Base. The entire home was very clean and organized with amenities that may not be listed but were appreciated. A few examples were board games, a Bluetooth stereo, a nice CD collection, blankets to use as you relax watching TV or hanging out in the back ""relax"" room. The room has an incredible massage chair. Highly recommend and we'll definitely be back! Great job on the home guys!"

We visited in winter and it was warm and cozy. Floyd even shoveled snow a couple times. Pretty cool!
Thank you again for getting me in early, Floyd. I appreciate it so much!

Stayed over a week","READ THE WHOLE THING (overall, great stay).
Why has no one mentioned the shower window??? First night i pulled in around 11 and went straight for the shower. The window made me uneasy but i thought 'they wouldn't have one that you could see into'... after my shower i set up my phone outside and went back in wearing a tshirt, sent the video to my family/friends and they could literally make out the logo and guess the tshirt i was wearing. Pretty much full view minus the fine details. Benefit of the doubt i reached out to the host, and he said there has never been a curtain there. I ended up tapping my raincoat over the window when showering. I may be hyper fixated on this because i am a solo female traveler.. but i didn't sleep for a few days terrified that i may have got unwanted attention. Honestly, a $10 privacy film would fix this problem and i sincerely hope he looks into it.
Other than the window my stay was great! I stayed for a full month working remotely. Not one issue with the wifi when working/zooming/streaming. There is plenty of space and a great sunroom with 3 skylights. Kitchen is fully stock and I'm talking down to muffin pans and a mixer. The neighborhood is very quite; there is a full council of outdoor cats on this street but they keep to their yards. Plenty of parking. His yard is rocks and stickers but he lives right by the courthouse which has a nice green area. I never met Floyd in person but he was very responsive and i think lives or at least stays out back. He took the trash cans to the curb which i appreciated."

We let Floyd know about a couple of issues and he responded within an hour or 2. The backyard is zero-scaped like the front yard with a lot of stickers so our dog unfortunately couldn’t play or do his business in the backyard. Luckily the Airbnb is located in a neighborhood and next to a park and other grassy areas so we could walk him."

Stayed a few nights","Andrea was very responsive and helpful with our questions. The house is nicely decorated and all of the rooms are very clean. We had no issues with the check-in. We found nice coffee selection and good appliances. We weren't disturbed by any neighborhood noise at night. Some reviews about bugs and spiders worried us before we booked. We had a couple of mildly pesky houseflies and 1 spider. Nothing out of the ordinary, and considering the location next to the Snake River...
The bedrooms are tight and one of the mattresses was too soft for us to sleep on, but the other firmer mattress was a full so it was a tighter fit that we're used to. Also, for more than two people, there's not much room for dining. Aside from these issues, we had a good stay and enjoyed the offerings on the entertainment system and very pretty view of the sunrise. We would like to stay again if I have business in the area."

Stayed a few nights","Great prices and wonderful remodel.
Since we We're visiting our son at the Air Force base Nearby, we found that the accommodations in Mountain Home town was either too shabby or way too expensive period we decided on Grandview because the distance from the base was about the same and was much more reasonably priced. The cost of the unit was at least 60 to 70% less. There a 3 star hotel in town.
This cottage has been remodeled quite fashionably.
We definitely had enough room for the two of us. When looking at the home from the outside is deceptive because there was a surprising amount of room within.
The kitchen had enough room to move around in, and there was a separate room to watch TV in.
The appliances and washing machine / dryer are brand new.
Don't bother packing towels, laundry soap, or dryer sheets because there was plenty there.
We will be definitely staying here for future trip to visit family at the AFB."

Stayed with kids",Very nice and quiet area! The space is perfect. Love the scenery. The house has everything you needed. I enjoyed it! The only little issue that have is the back door was hard to open and each corner had a lot of spiders. Had spiders crawl on me on bed and my kids are afraid of spiders. But I know this is the time of year of bugs coming in with all the rain and cold weather. I’m sure spraying home defense will help take care of it. Other than that we really did enjoy it! :)

Stayed a few nights","Cute house but there was damage to roof/ siding due to a tree falling on it. We weren’t advised of this before showing up. We drove up to a tarp on roof and debris in yard. Roofers did show up unannounced while we were there to work on it which wasn’t ideal but does show they care about property. Andrea did offer to refund, however, options were either triple the cost or an hour away from our son. So we decided to stay. If this wouldn’t have happened I believe we would’ve had a better experience. The location can’t be beat and if you are visiting an Airman it’s close. The price is also very reasonable. I just wish communication was better since the incident happened days before we arrived."

Stayed a few nights","Its a nice cozy house across from the banks of Snake River in a quiet town so it makes for wonderful sunrise photos. Easy scenic drive to Bruneau Sand Dunes and Cove. It has a full kitchen and good size bathroom for the house along with washer and dryer - handy after a dusty day hiking or swimming in the river. Just 2 notes, the wifi is spotty, it's OK for checking emails or sending texts but not for a zoom call/meetings/remote work. If going during warm weather, be prepared for alot of bugs that hover near the three lights in the entry/dining/kitchen area. There were cobwebs in ceiling corners with bugs, the front stoop was littered with them, as was the kitchen window. I don't begrudge the existence of bugs being next to the river/water (we are all experienced travelers), but wished the dead bugs were cleaned prior to our visit and the house was better sealed against nightly invasions."

Stayed a few nights","We rented this house to stay while attending my daughters wedding. The house was older but was furnished nice. We had issues with thousands of flying insects, spiders and their webs and came across a few centipedes during our stay. Spent several hours of our stay trying to keep up with the dead insects on every counter. Husband had to vacuum spiders and webs every day. Contacted Andrea and she was apologetic but I don’t think they attempted to resolve the issues. Both exterior doors had daylight around them so easy entry for unwanted pests. They need to get professional exterminators in and deep clean all the dead insects out. I would not recommend this unless you want to get the ambience of camping and being in the outdoors."

We found this place in tiny Grand View and it was easy working with Andrea to set up the reservation and check in. The house is clean and cozy, right by the Snake River. We visited the Bruneau Canyon and the dunes - two very interesting and lesser known spots - which were close to Grand View. Our only problem was staying on a Monday night, where all of the dining options close by are closed. The house has nice self-catering facilities in that case. Overall, a nice stop on our way back to Nevada."

Stayed a few nights","We visited on probably the hottest day of the year and arrived hot and tired. We had inquired ahead of booking to make sure there was a/c and the owner said yes. However, it turned out to be a window unit in the den only. When we reached out to Andrea, she did finally send someone out to put in a second one in the front bedroom. So, two of us slept on the floor of the den and the other two in the front bedroom. We found a hairball in the bathtub, dirty towels in the washing machine, and bugs and spiderwebs in every corner and windowsil. It is a house on the river and not a fancy hotel, but cleanliness and temperature seem to be a bare minimim for comfort. We appreciated that she sent someone to install the second unit - because we would have definitely had to have left if not for that."

I spend a good half of the first day of my stay cleaning and getting rid of all bugs and spiders because that place was infested! It took 3 whole cans of bugs spray and a lot of wipes to get the place to where it was sleepable for me and especially my girlfriend who is absolutely terrified of spiders. I was very disappointed and some spiders even came back so the spider killing and cleaning was almost never ending.

The beds were comfortable and having a washer and dryer in the house was extremely helpful. And best of all, the house is only a short walk from ice cream available at the grocery store on Main Street!"

The house had everything, down to laundry detergent and coffee. The bonus of watching a herd of goats being led back and fourth by dogs, and frequent visits by said dogs to check on us was awesome. We will 100% return to this rental everytime we visit the grandkids. I cannot emphasise enough what a gem this place is. if you are going to be staying anywhere between Boise, Grand View, or Mountain Home, THIS IS THE PLACE.

The beauty of the surroundings instantly captivated us, and we knew we were in for a treat.
The Airbnb was equipped with all the essentials and more. The kitchen had everything we needed to prepare our own meals, allowing us to enjoy home-cooked dishes amidst the serene setting. Fresh linens, toiletries, and even some local treats were provided, adding a thoughtful and personal touch to our stay.
The hosts truly went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed and pampered. Throughout our stay the hosts went above and beyond. They were warm, welcoming, and readily available to assist. Thank you for such an amazing memory."

Last thing, Mosquitoes are pretty dense, make sure to bring lots of bug spray! The couches could be updated as the stuffing was coming out at the seam of the back bottom cushions, still rather comfy though! The wheel of the BBQ grill fell off when we tried to move it a bit closer to the kitchen side of house, was able to put back on however we were slightly weary of using it after that.
Would highly recommend this stay and will definitely return in the future!"

Stayed a few nights","Melissa's Grand View is just that! A beautiful stop and comfy home. Beds were great and the kitchen well stocked. We were gifted with a yummy huckleberry bar and there was coffee and hot cocoa available. The tv wasn't internet connected. However, if you bring a laptop or something else with hdmi connection several hdmi cables are there ready to connect and you'll have Netflix, Amazon Prime TV, etc. via your component and provided wifi. Speaking of, wifi was really good, we never had any buffering. As for the area - it's a wonderland! First, the ranch land, baby goats, cows and horses were a blast to watch. Then travel the hour to the petroglyphs - lots of fun looking amongst the rocks and watching the golden eagles nest as they try to keep those babies fed. The information center is pretty cool too. Then head for the sand dunes… who'd of thunk there would be giant sand dunes in the middle sagebrush country! There's also an observatory there, but sadly we weren't there over the weekend and it was closed. For a short trip from the house check out the Trueblood wildlife area where there were all kinds of birds to see as well as rascally jack rabbits. Make sure to bring most of the groceries you might need. Grand View has the basics, don't expect more than that. There's a cafe we stopped at which Melissa listed in her info book and the food was good. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit. I for one would love to return someday."

Stayed a few nights","This house is no less then amazing! The views, the amenities, the location were spot on. It was clean, updated, and very cozy. It's quiet country space that is sorely sought after. Melissa is a very prompt and welcoming host. This space is very family friendly! This is a must stay...."

Group trip","Melissa’s airbnb was a fun place to stay. Communication was quick and easy. It was clean, well stocked with extra towels, sheets and little extras. The atmosphere was great with the cows, goats and different species of birds. The sunsets were gorgeous over the pond. We had a great time playing ping pong and relaxing on the wrap around porch. We would stay here again."

This house has all you need to have a great getaway. A surprise is the local grocery in the tiniest little town ever, with a couple of charming diners and baked goods. Our entire family enjoyed our stay on this beautiful family ranch."

Stayed one night","This place so so much cooler than I expected. I didn’t realize I’d literally be staying on the farm. There are horses right out the window and the cows can be seen in the distance. It’s pretty remote but that’s what I honestly enjoyed about it. It’s a great place to get out of the city and just enjoy being alone, or alone with the family. I enjoyed being able to cook and just relax by the fire. Coffee watching the sunrise was incredible and the sunset even more so!"

Melissa was available to answer questions., provide ideas of events in town, collect trash, and provide additional drinking water.
We would have extended our stay here because it was such a good fit for us, but it was already booked. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"

Stayed one night","Really pleasant, quiet place to rest. My husband and I are both from Ranch families and felt completely comfortable with our children here. We had a sunset that was phenomenal and the bird sightings alone were remarkable. This the place you go to connect with your family, put electronics away and swing on a tire hanging from an old tree. Bring your own coffee, sit on the massive patio and watch the watch the morning mist lift with the heat of the day."
