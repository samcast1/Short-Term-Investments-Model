Stayed a few nights","My husband and I stayed at Omar’s place for a long weekend. It was perfect for the two of us, had plenty of space, a nice green backyard, and pleasant front porch to enjoy the morning coffee, and very clean. Even though it’s close to a busy road, the bedroom is surprisingly quiet and road noise from the porch is faint. We would love to stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","Omar’s house is great! It’s in an excellent location with a super short walk to the beach. The house is very clean and has literally everything you could need in the kitchen. They had some toys for kids and even board games. The beds are SUPER comfortable, I was worried about sharing a queen with my wife, but it ended up being super comfortable for both of us. We have a 1 year old and the only complaint is that the window coverings didn’t block any light at all, resulting in really bad baby sleep. We recommend bringing portable black out curtains if you need them. The master bedroom has sheer curtains as well if you’re a sensitive sleeper. Huge backyard space, gorgeous front yard and deck and beautiful garden! 10/10 recommend, we’d stay here again in a heart beat. Thank you for such a great vacation!"

We used the hot tub every night as well as a few nights up front with the fire pit. Neighbors were all very friendly and the walk down to the pier was just right to stretch our legs each day. We followed Ciara's recommendation to visit arches state beach park and were not disappointed. There is a wonderful ""warehouse"" neighborhood on the north side of Santa Cruz that has wineries, breweries and great dining. It is right of Hwy 1 on the west side of road. Thank you Ciara for a wonderful stay!"

Stayed a few nights","If you're looking for a charming and comfortable getaway near UC Santa Cruz, (we came here for our son’s graduation), look no further than Mermaid Cottage. From the moment we arrived, we knew we were in for a relaxing stay. The self-check-in process was a breeze with the lockbox and easy to follow instructions from the host.
The atmosphere of the cottage was incredibly relaxing, and we particularly enjoyed the back deck. The kitchen was fully equipped with everything we needed to prepare meals, and the coffee maker was a delightful bonus. While we brought our own favorite morning coffee, we were pleasantly surprised to find that the coffee maker could also grind coffee beans.
When we inquired about hosting our two sons who live in the area for lunch, the host Ciara promptly responded and allowed us to do so.
Overall, our experience at Mermaid Cottage was fantastic. It provided a comfortable and convenient base for our visit to UC Santa Cruz, and we appreciated the thoughtful amenities"

Peaceful, clean, and full of amenities. We literally almost baked a cake, there were so many supplies and ingredients. But the beach called us…you know how it goes!
The home design and cleanliness was top notch. The plants made us feel good, like living in a beachside jungle bungalow. I definitely took notes for my future home design ;)
Place is great for a couple or small group. Cannot recommended enough and will be booking again when we hit up Santa Cruz again. Thanks Ciara"

Stayed with kids","I’d like to start out by saying Ciara is super sweet and I had no issues with her or the home, however I feel as though before you rent this home you need to know a few things… if you do decide to use their beautiful driveway to park The front of your house is free game. And teenager smoking pot to middle-aged men bumping rap music at 10:30 at night. You are right next to an a two-story apartment complex that is peering into the backyard. Going topless in the Jacuzzi is not an option. You have little to no privacy. Everybody’s windows are open. Everybody’s door is open. You can hear everyone’s arguments and farts, which means everyone can hear you and your farts. The bed in the master bedroom is so comfortable however my sisters twin mattress that folded into a queen was really uncomfortable for her. This home is super clean and has beautiful plants placed throughout the backyard."

We did encounter a little mishap with the cleaning services when we arrived, however Ciara had the cleaning service called and fixed the problem within 30 minutes of us checking in. This location was close by everything that we planned on visiting, the boardwalk, the beaches, downtown were all within 5-10 minutes driving. The space was well furnished, sheets were cozy and had all the kitchenware for us to make dinners for our 5 year old son. The only 2 things that I wish they had was a children’s stool for the bathroom, so that he could reach the sink when we were brushing his teeth and a mat in the shower to prevent slippage. Outside of that, great getaway spot, would definitely stay here again the next time we are in Santa Cruz!"

And if you’re into nature, there is a beautiful boardwalk nature park just at the end of the street. The main area of downtown Santa Cruz with it’s excellent cafe’s, bars and shops is less than a 10 minute walk away. I’ll definitely be back to spend longer."

Stayed one night","Awesome place! You should consider it as a unique experience, not as a luxury hotel. It's inconvenient to get down the ladder if you want to go to a toilet, you won't want to shower if it's chilly outside, but it's definitely worth it to stay there for a night. The tree house is a beautiful piece of art and engineering, the place is amazing, you are right in the middle of a redwood forest. It's super quiet, it was a pleasure to wake up there in the morning and look at the redwoods through your ceiling and walls. When we stayed there the weather was quite chilly, around 10C/50F at night. But an electric blanket worked very well, we even turned it off because it was too hot at max power.
The only downside was an almost finished toilet paper roll that ended right in the middle of a business, and there were no replacement at all! Luckily we had one in a car, but that's not what you expect paying 1k for a night."

Four years and 1 kid later we finally made it out here for our 5 year anniversary. It is an understatement to say that this place was worth the wait! The pictures on the site do not do this place justice! Our stay at the Pine Cone was nothing short of magical. Shannon and her staff provided a world class experience and I cannot speak highly enough about our stay. if you're considering a stay at the Pine Cone, Do It!

Stayed one night","My partner and I had a great stay at the Pinecone despite it being rainy! Check in was very unique because our host (Amber) kept good communication and was flexible on having us check in past the 4pm period. The rundown was very easy to understand the safety of going up and down the Pinecone. The inside was pretty clean for a treehouse and the windows were clear enough to enjoy the scenery. the bed was comfortable and had heated blankets. (I ended up getting too hot in the middle of the night!) Waking up was amazing to hear the birds and have the trees surrounding you. We didn't get to use the shower but the bathroom system was maintained well. There is a light above the stairs so if you had to wake up in the middle of the night and crawl down, you would be able to find your way down. The only heads up I will give to others that need to pee a lot is try to plan your trips so you don't go back and forth! Great experience & would be willing to come back!"

During the day, the sunlight filters through the trees, highlighting the intricate design of the Pinecone, and at night, the place transforms into a magical retreat under the stars.
Shannon is an outstanding host—thoughtful and attentive, ensuring that every detail is perfect. Her communication was excellent, making our stay smooth and enjoyable. This treehouse is not just a place to stay, it's a wonderful experience. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a special getaway. Thank you, Shannon, for making our weekend memorable!"

Stayed one night","As an avid traveler, I always look forward to unique accommodations, which is why I chose the treehouse. The concept when you arrive is genuinely breathtaking. However, my excitement was short lived when entering this architectural marvel.
The first thing you notice was the visible wear and tear. Insulation tapes hung loosely from the windows, a seemingly easy fix that was inexplicably ignored. Several windows were chipped, and a few light bulbs were out. It's disheartening to find such neglect in a place unique like this one.
Furthermore, the heater, vital for a comfortable stay, failed within half a day. This lack of maintenance doesn't just dampen the experience; it raises concerns about what else might be overlooked, unsettling for anyone hoping for a peaceful night rest.
Now, if your goal is to impress your social media followers with stunning visuals, then this treehouse will check your box.
However, for $800+ you can have a 5-star experience at many hotels with breakfast. 🤷🏼‍♂️"

Stayed one night","Our overnight stay in the Pinecone was nothing short of magical.
We stayed during the rain, but that made for a more beautiful retreat being indoors hearing the rain trickling all night and into the early misty and mystical morning watching the fog pierce the trees surrounding us. The string lights, which are dimmable, make for the ultimate fairytale-feeling ambiance in this treehouse, along with the cute hanging plants on the windows.
Our trek to the bathroom was quite frequent as we enjoyed wine and hot cocoa in the Pinecone all night, but it was a fun and scenic journey up and down the ladder even through the light rain.
I’d say the underdog of this whole place has got to be the bathroom. It’s a separate unit with a large window that opens to your own private forest view that makes you truly feel like you’re out in the wilderness. The bathroom supplies a hot rainfall shower with probably the best direct forest view you can ever get.
Thanks o2 treehouse for the memories!"

Stayed one night","My wife and I booked the Pinecone on a whim for our 17th anniversary, and it was well worth it. It was such a unique place to stay. We stayed on a rainy, foggy night in December, and the sound of the rain and gentle sway in the wind was so peaceful. The 360-degree views were amazing, not to mention looking up at the treetops, clouds, and stars (when we were lucky enough to have breaks in the clouds). We were a little worried about staying warm due to the season and weather, but the small propane heater kept the interior at a comfortable temperature. Climbing the 30-foot ladder was not for the faint of heart, but was so much fun. The option to open the sliding doors on the bathroom to have a more open-air shower was a great feature. We went to dinner in Felton, which was only a short 15-minute drive, and the trip into Santa Cruz the next morning was about the same. We loved everything about our stay, and we'll remember it for the rest of our lives."

Once you’re inside the treehouse, it’s beautiful, private, and the views are glorious. Thoughtful lighting creates this dreamy mood, and the bed is so so so comfortable. I haven’t slept this well in ages!
Truly, a remarkable experience — tho as other reviews mention, that ladder is crazy steep! A bit nerve wrecking if you’re not good with heights!
A one of a kind experience. So happy for it!"

I didn’t tell him anything about it, so he didn’t know what to expect. His reaction to seeing it for the first time was priceless. We could not get over how amazing and unique it was, suspended in the trees! Seeing and using the ladder for the first time was scary, but we got more comfortable with it the more we used it. The room and bathroom were very well-maintained. The room was really cozy and comfortable, and the propane heater was easy to use and warmed up the space nicely. The bathroom was clean and had hot running water. Shannon and Amber were very easy to contact and communicate with. I would love to stay again!"

We felt very at peace and ease as we listened to nature as we glared up into the sky and redwoods while laying on the bed. A truly out of this world experience.

Stayed one night","Pros: most breathtaking beautiful and unique Airbnb my partner and I have ever stayed in! Picturesque, scenic, “bragging-rights” type of a place.
Cons: it’s not insulated! Needs a lot of repairs and maintenance. Very masculine vibe. Feels like camping / glamping. A one night stay felt like enough.
Was hoping for a romantic date…. And to connect with nature…. but was hard to really enjoy the space being so cold on the INSIDE with only 1 small heater. We realised the windows were either broken / or just open and letting in the cold. The tree house, despite being out in nature, felt to us disconnected from nature. (Just a personal observation.)
One little suggestion might be to add a hot tub into the bathroom and upgrade the bedsheets to a nice linen. (I brought a linen throw with me, a speaker and dimply lit camping light, and it helped create a nice vibe. Would be nice had little touches been provided, as well as an electric water boiler and tea station.) ☺️❤️🌸"

Totally worth it! Only comment I will make is that if you plan to stay here make sure you don’t have any arrangements or reservations prior to your stay. You do have to meet and greet a host before you have access to the house and it can take 10-15 minutes before you go on and about with your day. I think that’s important to know! Shannon is very responsive and quickly to re solve any small unexpected issues! OVER ALL IM VERY PLEASED!!"

We had such a great anniversary weekend in Santa Cruz. First ziplining in Mount Hermon, then staying at the treehouse and finally a tour at the Lick Observatory. We appreciated being able to check in an hour early right after ziplining. Alastair was very responsive and accommodating! The treehouse was as magical as we expected. The smell of the composting toilet was a little stronger than we hoped for but luckily it was warm enough to leave the windows open which helped.

Stayed one night","The experience at The Pinecone Tree House was truly lovely. The communication with Shannon was smooth and efficient and Chandra, the person who welcomed us, was very kind. The place itself is simply beautiful and has a magical touch that captivated us. We are genuinely happy to have had the opportunity to be there and enjoy its serene and peaceful ambiance, from the day to the night when the sky looked breathtaking.
While our stay was wonderful, we believe that, considering the price, some additional amenities could be added to further enhance the experience. For example, having a mini-refrigerator would be great, and perhaps a small gesture like a chocolate on the bed would be a lovely touch. However, overall, we are very satisfied and happy with our stay.
We sincerely thank you for providing us with such a special and memorable experience!"

Stayed one night","First, the concept is wonderful and unique. I give it A+ for this creativity and my husband who IS a glamper while I am a camper, was really looking forward to this stay. Unfortunately we spent the night wide awake till 3am thanks to a house nearby (according to the host) that was playing incredibly loud clanging music till that time. I have audio recordings of this and messaged Airbnb and my host at 11pm, 1am and finally 3am (to airbnb requesting a partial refund because I was so mad). Imagine paying $800 for this stay and not being able to enjoy the peace and quiet in the woods? It just seemed like a cruel joke. Bed was saggy surprisingly - most glamping Ive stayed at the beds are comfy. You have to bring your own fuel for the stove. And in the middle of soaping myself, hot water turned icy cold. $800 for this does not make sense to me. The host offered me an extra night (thank u!!) but had to leave since we had plans. She refunded me $200 (thank you)! - Appreciate the gesture!"

The hosts were communicative from the get go about setting reasonable expectations from this experience to enjoy it to the fullest. We were assisted by Chandra on our day of visit and she gave my wife and I, a very warm welcome as we got escorted from the entry of driveway to the pinecone. She definitely help reduce our anxiety and get us excited about the stay.
The Pinecone itself is spectacular. The construction and how everything came together is a piece of art in itself. Its a nice spacious place with 360 degree views of the forest. The very slight swinging of the Pinecone as we moved inside or with wind made is feel more connected to the nature.

Stayed one night","If I could give this treehouse more than a 5 star rating, I would. It exceeded my expectations and I was officially able to cross something off on my bucket list after waiting for 3 years. This pinecone is not for the faint of heart, but waking up 30 feet above the ground to a breathtaking view of the CA redwoods made everything worth it. Shannon & Amber were both incredibly responsive, provided very clear instructions, and were readily available if we had any questions. Can’t wait for my next trip out here!"

It definitely lived up to his expectations. They are still processing how magical this was. They enjoyed being in the pinecone, being outside of it (surroundings were beautiful) and they even enjoyed the bathroom! Very much a wonderful, unique experience!"

Stayed one night","I really loved staying at the unique Pinecone Treehouse in Bonny Doon....it was exactly what the pictures and description made it sound like, and both Amber and Shannon were very responsive and communicative in the days and hours leading up to our check-in. Amber met us at the gates and showed us around the property--but it was brief and to the point, just the way we like it after a long drive! We loved the peace and quiet of staying in the treehouse and the bathroom/shower amenities were totally fine (in fact, gorgeous to look out into the woods from the open air 'window') for this camping/glamping experience. The treehouse was clean, at night there were lights down below and within the treehouse for easy visibility in getting around. Truly a unique and memorable experience-already so many friends who saw my photos posted online have inquired about details, it's so original and beautifully rendered-from a creative and engineering standpoint...I highly recommend!"

Stayed one night","The pinecone was a truly unique experience. A beautiful camping experience suspended in the trees.
I think it’s important to note that you will be glamping- with a beautiful pinecone in the air, rather than a tent. The bed was cozy, the heated blankets kept us warm, the shower was warm.
Make sure to take any food and drink with you and leave it in you car at the bottom of the tree so you can grab snacks and drinks throughout the day. Only bring what you need for the night in a back pack up into the pinecone. Everything in, everything out.
We were pleasantly surprised that there were Uber that could take us in and out of town. We went out to dinner and then came back to enjoy the beautiful scenery and environment.
Jamie and Shannon were super responsive and helpful when we ran into a couple issues. Over all I would recommend anyone experience it if they get the opportunity."

Stayed one night","The pinecone treehouse is absolutely magical, and at the same time, rustic… Chose this location for our engagement proposal, and was definitely the most unique place we’ve ever stayed,
As other reviewers have stated visiting during the rainy season made the stay even more enchanting, with the clear roof and walls, being able to watch the raindrops come down and hear them as you drift off to sleep 💤
We visited during one of California’s famous atmospheric rivers
Highway One was flooded 5-10 feet underwater along the coast with an hour and a half detour and we saw several cars flipped over upside down and accidents in multiple locations on our way to and from so it’s no small wonder with such an intricate structure that there were a few small leaks, which I’m sure the owners will tend to at the soonest opportunity when the weather clears."

The entire place was amazing, and the heated blankets provided enough warmth for us throughout the night, so we didn't have to use the heater. They even provided us with extra blankets. Shannon also allowed us to use their camp stove, which made our anniversary an incredible experience. Overall, I would say that this place is definitely worth the money!"

The drive may be a bit windy to get to but this place is very secluded. It is in a gated community so it feels safe. I would say it gets cold but they provide a portable buddy heater and electric blanket which helped! Like many others warned, if you need to use the bathroom alot, it takes some effort to go up and down the ladder. Think of it as glamping with immaculate design. We only stayed one night as it is a bit pricey but if you can afford it, dont hesitate and book this place!"

If you are into engineering, you will spend hours understanding the work that went in to building, hoisting and securing such a heavy structure in the canopy. We found it easy to get in and out of the cone via the nautical stair (we are 62&68 years old, super fit). Also, the hosts are very responsive to the guests needs and professional in the way they run their business. It was a once in a lifetime experience worth living, if you are into glamping & treehouses! Make sure to travel light in a small backpack! Lovely!"

The bedroom is beautiful with lovely plush bedding and twinkling string lights. They even have a hammock underneath, which we used quite a bit. Chandra, our host, was amazing and made sure we had everything we needed. The bathroom was also incredible. You just cannot beat the rainfall shower in the middle of the redwoods. We found ourselves spending more time in the bathroom than usual just taking in the beautiful views. If you have an opportunity to stay at this lovely location, definitely jump on it. We cannot wait to come back and hope to explore even more locations and treehouses!"

There was a ton of communication and lots of helpful tips shared with us that made our stay even better. I’d definitely recommend traveling with your belongings in a backpack for ease of using the ladder and pro tip that we didn’t have service at the gate so it made contacting the host a bit tricky at first - but we had service in the pinecone and the wifi was great so just a heads up for when you arrive at the gate and need to message the host. We got a late start on the morning and they were super friendly and offered a later and very flexible check out time. It was truly a great experience and the hosts were amazing - we’ll definitely never forget our time at the pinecone!"

Stayed one night","AMAZING unique once in a lifetime experience and AirBnb. We have been to a lot of treehouses/Hobbit Hole/etc. but this one was hands down the most extraordinary yet! We only stayed one night, but it was such a magical night! Inside the pinecone is so cozy and magical and perfect. The climb up/down was very easy for us and made for such a unique experience. The outdoor shower was amazing, always love getting to shower in the forest! There was a power outage in the area (not the owners fault at all) sometime in the night and into the morning, so our devices did not charge and we had no power all morning and checked out at 11am before it came back, but honestly when you are there things like power are trivial. The nature, the art, the ambience... that is what it is all about. We read and soaked up nature without the need of power. Honestly it does us all well to truly disconnect every now and then and appreciate the other things life has to offer. Also such a short drive to Santa Cruz where we spent an evening out at the amazing restaurants and the next day shopping at all the great shops and enjoying amazing coffee from Verve! We love this area and I would stay over and over again!"

We did pack some extra blankets which were nice to use as we sat on the little floor cushions and had wine and snacks. It was incredibly quiet and peaceful.
The pinecone is also close to town, so we came to check-in and get the info on the lights and safety and then went into town for supplies! We brought back pizza which we ate at the picnic table, looking up at the pinecone :)

Stayed one night","I booked this place for my girlfriends birthday and it showed fully booked but they were kind enough to make space for us for a night upon special request as I wanted to surprise her.
We were greeted by Chandra who was a wonderful host to us. She took us through everything as the place is totally unconventional. Our stay was very comfortable, a perfect place for a special occasion. And to make it even better it rained in the evening and it was a view beyond words for a rainy night in the woods suspended in a glass pinecone! The morning was a beautiful clear sky and we were mind blown! You’d be really lucky if you get to experience it all. They had a nice heater to keep us warm throughout. Also do not miss out on the net underneath the structure. It’s a fun place to hangout too.
The open bath was a cherry on top as if it even needed more. We loved the whole experience. It was a beautiful memorable stay for us, definitely makes up for a special occasion if you want something extraordinary.
Also special thanks to Chandra. My watch had fallen down on the road where I parked and I had lost hopes but she specially went back to check on it and hand delivered it. I cannot thank her enough for the gesture.
Overall it is a wonderful space with wonderful people. I totally recommend going there for an out of the box experience."

The place itself is such an incredible art piece that is a must-see in person, but then getting the chance to stay in it is unbelievable. Climbing the ladder, while daunting at first, is actually a breeze after a couple trips, and we immediately let go of all the fears. We also got the chance to stay in hot, cold, rain, and sun all in one go, and we felt comfortable the whole time. We didn’t even need to use the heater. The only scary thing was that the whole place will rock and spin a bit (not a lot) in the wind, which was jarring at first, but we felt so safe that we almost forgot about after a couple hours. The bathroom is also amazing and looks out into the woods. The hot water gets HOT and you can close class doors to keep the heat in a bit more too making it very comfortable.
Another big thing to note is that while the treehouse is deep enough in the trees to feel secluded, you’re also a very short drive from Santa Cruz. We barely wanted to leave the place, but when we did for food, it was extremely easy to drive out and come back in, and there’s lots of great restaurants and things to do. And the dirt road up to the treehouse is not long nor hard to drive at all.
Overall, this was a phenomenal experience. We couldn’t ask for anything better!"

Stayed one night","One word: wow.
IMPORTANT: READ THE CHECK IN INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY. Even if the gate opens, it’s imperative you wait outside the gate so you don’t accidentally end up on a neighbor’s property.
By doing so, you’ll help keep this place around and it is SO worth it. If you’re thinking it will be cold, I went in early February & found the comforter on the bed to be extremely warm. The shower also has hot water. (And had to be the most scenic and relaxing shower I’ve ever taken in my life).
Overall, would absolutely recommend, Santa Cruz was an easy drive away for other activities. If you’re afraid of heights, the ladder will be scary for you, but otherwise, the ladder is not difficult to navigate (you just need to focus). (:"

Stayed one night","My mom and I really enjoyed ourselves. It was magical and such a unique experience that we will forever remember. Hopefully I can bring my son when he turns 18, but then again, he may not want to hang with his mom by then. Your communication was fabulous and dependable. There were a few things that could be leveled up, especially as people are paying a significant amount of money. The heater did not work (and though you offered to replace propane tank in an hour, it was late so not worth the hassle), and the windows could've been cleaned (per my mom). It was 33 degrees overnight, but luckily we wore layers and the comforter was SUPER warm! I understand the windows have since been cleaned and what a tough job that is, but it is also part of the allure . Aesthetically speaking, there were light bulbs missing and a few that didn't work. WE ADORED the bathroom and it was definitely the best shower of my life (so glad I read the reviews because I almost didn't shower). I loved the morning deer visits! Definitely a bucket list trip!! I recommend eating in Santa Cruz and visiting the UC Santa Cruz Botanical garden. THANK YOU!!"

My boyfriend and I stayed in Jan and the weather was pleasant and there was no wind. The treehouse is surprisingly stable and insulated from the outside world. It’s chilly at night but the blanket keeps you decently warm. There were occasionally moths but otherwise not bothered by bugs.
The bathroom below was extremely clean and beautiful. The pump and heater wasn’t turned on during our stay.
We were pleasantly surprised that there was electricity and WiFi! At the treehouse! Very handy for charging up some electronics and lightweight use.
We read more about o2 treehouse and other creative works from the team after our stay and we are super inspired. Keep up the good work and thank you for building the pinecone house and keeping it well maintained for people like us to visit and stay!"

Stayed one night","A truly unique, amazing experience! Shannon and the team were super responsive and we had a wonderful time. Like other reviews mentioned:
-Make sure you're comfortable with heights and climbing a steep, 30-foot alternating rung ladder. I'm ok with heights and even then was a little nervous on the ladder the first couple of times.
-The bathroom is down the ladder and several feet away - it's not the easiest to reach in the nighttime, so be aware if you're someone who usually wakes up in the night to go to the bathroom.
-don't pack a lot - a backpack is best for going up and down the ladder. I carried both a backpack and food tote and that was just manageable. A suitcase would be really tough.
-Definitely bring long underwear! We stayed on Jan 1 - temps didn't go below freezing, but were just about. It can get cold up there, but Shannon & the team put several heavy blankets on the bed for us, which were super comfy.
All in all, highly recommend!"

What a wonderful and magical experience! It is definitely a lot like camping but much much better! Couldn’t have asked for more with the host they really went out of their way to make us comfortable even though it was a holiday! A must see if you love the outdoors and want to see them from a comfy treehouse!

Stayed one night","For the value/ night at this treehouse I have to say our expectations were very high. Once we got there we were a bit disappointed as to how messy the area around the tree house was. Totally understand that trees fall and all of that but there was abandoned furniture and other random objects rotting around. Overall the treehouse is a unique stay, super nice to be listening to the rain amongst the trees. The hot shower was very nice. The space heater is more of a decoration since the treehouse ain’t fully enclosed the heat doesn’t retain at all but the bedding is VERY warm and kept us cozy alll night long. The host did do a good job at communicating with us and accommodating us. I really don’t mean for this to be a very “harsh” review, but I want to be honest about the expectations we had and our over all experience."

Stayed one night","This is a wonderful, truly unique treehouse experience! The lighting, actual treehouse and decor is stunning!! If you're looking for a ""glamping"" sort of experience, I would absolutely recommend this place. I would, however, like to add a couple of notes of caution that I hope would help future guests during booking:
- The treehouse has no insulation so assume the temperature inside is the temperature outside
- There is a propane powered small space heater provided but you cannot run it throughout the night so it gets really cold especially since we went in the peak of winter
- The bathroom is very clean and has hot water provided but it is cold in there too. Also, note that there is a compostable toilet provided"

Stayed one night","It’s a magician amazing experience with the treehouse windows opening up to the skies above. It is a steep climb of stairs to get in but that was anticipated from the reviews. Once inside it’s an amazing feeling being in the bed and looking up through the trees. The bedding is warm and comfy. The portable heater heats up but you will want to be under the covers in a cold night for sure. The lighting inside can dim to a very pretty glow. The shower is down the stair in the bathroom of course, so be prepared to have to go up or down the steep steps in the middle of the night if need be. The shower itself opens to a beautiful view as the hot steam feels oh so good as you gaze out into the trees. I loved it as did my girlfriend…. She was surprised and she thought it was amazing like I did"

Stayed a few nights","Dustin, and Shannon were kind, friendly, and informative. The communication was detailed and helpful. Kiki was our check in coordinator, who gave us a great and welcoming run down of the treehouse, and Niko, the social media guy, was also friendly and helpful. All 4 staff were kind, welcoming, helpful, friendly, and seemed just as excited for us as we were to stay. The Treehouse is gorgeous!! The directions were easy to follow. We got food recs from the awesome staff, and this is a great, central location to the Wharf, Boardwalk,Downtown, trails, and the college. The views are like no other!! I recommend checking out the YouTube video for a small sample of the beautiful scenery, and to get a visual of how the Treehouse is set up. The designated parking was convenient, the stairs have sandpaper for easier grip, the bed is so so comfy too! Bring extra bedding just in case. There's a heater provided, but we didn't run it all night for safety reasons. The bathroom has a gorgeous view with Earth-friendly features, and the water gets really hot! We especially enjoyed laying in the comfortable bed and being able to see the woods from all angles. The owners are near by, but the local residences are just far enough away that you feel fully immersed in the Redwoods and Pine. The wifi is stable, the provided towels are big and soft, and we really appreciated the head lamps! We loved everything about this PineCone Treehouse. Thanks again, O2 team!"

We’re still mesmerized how this was engineered, it’s truly a work of art and a once in a lifetime experience to stay in it! We felt totally safe and at home, it’s the perfect balance of feeling like you’re in the wilderness but also knowing that the host Jamie lives on the property if we needed anything. There was heavy rain during our stay and that made it even more magical, going to sleep to the sound of rainfall was so cozy. The bed and blankets were extremely comfortable, the string lights were a romantic touch and even the bathroom is an experience in itself. Showering with the windows open to the view of the forest was blissful. Also special mention to Shannon for being so great to communicate with. I’m an AirBnB host myself and was really impressed with the easy communication and her hospitality in helping me move my dates around when I couldn’t make my original booking date. All in all 11/10 experience! Thank you, thank you, thank you!"

My girlfriend and I stayed fo stayed on an unseasonably warm fall night, so did not use the space heater although one was available. The description of the unique location was extremely accurate, with all the disclaimers and amenities made very clear. The hosts were super communicative and helpful with our arrival and checkout, even though were were slightly late to the checkin.
Although it is on the pricey side for an overnight stay, I would say that is is completely worth the extra $$$ for the experience alone :)"

Stayed a few nights","This is a one of a kind stay. Truly special. Feels smaller than it looks but also feels incredibly large. It’s off a dirt road in a private residence above the UC Santa Cruz campus in Bonny Doons, and it was amazing. It’s something I checked off my bucket list and don’t think I’ll ever stay anywhere like this again. Dustin and the o2 team are amazing for having designed this. The place has its rough edges but… it’s a pinecone suspended from the trees, you’ll never see/experience anything like it again.
Few things
- if you’re scared of heights, might not be for you. It’s 30 feet in the air, suspended by 5 wires, and its really stable, but had a friend who came with me that decided they couldn’t sleep there due to the heights, though they visited.
- there’s one power strip and WiFi, and the shower is absolutely incredible… but when you’re in the pinecone expect some camping conditions outside the bed. There are some bugs/moths/spiders around the area and you need to expect that. You’re truly in nature and it’s beautiful.
- There’s a netting area you can hang out right below the main floor that’s pretty incredible/comfortable.
- During the day it can be hot, and at night it can be cold. No real windows in the place that open (when I visited), and there isn’t ac/fans etc, so just expect that. Santa Cruz and Bonny Doon are beautiful, go explore during the day - Santa Cruz’ as a city has amazing food and places to visit.
- nighttime + sunrise are incredible to be in the pinecone during. Can’t emphasize that enough."

Stayed one night","This place is a true experience. My wife and I spent one night in the Pinecone and it was amazing. The structure is remarkable. I found myself appreciating construction over and over. Once we got comfortable being suspended from trees in a structure that moves, we enjoyed the main area and the “hammock” area at the bottom of the Pinecone.
Waking up in the morning and being in the trees was beautiful. My wife said multiple times that she felt like she was in a birds nest.
We were both surprised at how quiet it was. We brought dice and cards and played games on the picnic table i to the night. There are some string lights by the picnic table and in the Pinecone which are nice.
I recommend this place for a unique experience and getaway. You need to be comfortable with climbing the ladder but once you understand how to navigate the stairs, you will love this place.
Thank you for sharing your place with us! Hope we can come back here or stay at another o2 Treehouse property in the future."

And that did not go unnoticed! So by the time I finally got here this weekend…. All I could think was breathtaking! My friend and I had a lovely overnight getaway and we were both so impressed with the pinecone. At night it’s magical the way it’s lit up. We were worried we’d be cold at night but we actually got really hot and the bed kept us plenty warm. The open shower in the bathroom was great as well, I loved that you had a view of the redwoods.

The ladder ascending/descending would be a little tricky for the first time but soon after few tries you get used to it. Dustin and his team are super friendly and responsive. They even texted me the second day of my stay to make sure everything is ok with us. The pinecone itself is so picturesque and you can capture beautiful shots for your IG (if you’re an IG user like me). Book the first available spot when it gets open. It’s getting booked really fast.

Stayed one night","Really unique and cool experience. The bed in the trees is incredible, and it’s a joy to wake up to the sounds of the forest while being in a very comfortable bed. The whole experience is thought out and the instructions were very clear.
The room itself is fairly large and feels very safe and sturdy. You can’t really feel it sway that much - when you stand you can see it moving a little bit, but I’d say it’s significantly less than we anticipated.
The check in process went without a hitch and the host was very welcoming. There were no issues finding the place, and it’s really close to Santa Cruz proper, which was a nice surprise,
Our showers hot water didn’t work for the majority of the stay which was pretty unfortunate, but they said it was due to the propane tank being out of fuel and was fixed the morning we were supposed to check out. Dustin and co gave us a late checkout to allow us to shower. Not being able to shower was fairly frustrating as the cold water was absolutely frigid, so make sure you shower before hand in case it doesn’t work."

Stayed one night","The pinecone was as amazing as it was from the photos! We took great picture of it just with our phone.
Although the pinecone is made of glass, it was quite stable. The stairs was steep but also a great fun experience to climb up and down! We liked it. Because the room is on the upper part of the pinecone, the windows are facing upward. So other people can barely see the inside from the ground.
We were also lucky to spot deers in the woods.
We do see people got displaced from the fire living nearby. They were quiet and friendly :)
Some small things we found a bit inconvenient - one was that there wasn't hot water. So we wasn't able to take a shower. It was really cold at night, so a hot shower could have been helpful. We wasn't able to connect to wifi but there were cellular signals. Another thing is the compostible toilet. I was sensitive to the smell when opened the hole. But the ventilation of the restroom was great so most of the time it's the fresh smell of the redwoods."

Stayed one night","Loved this location and experience. I'm a sucker for treehouses and very proud to say that I'll be looking forward to attending more treehouses of all types in the near future. This stay was very special for me since my brothers and I use to build our own as kids.
A few tips:
The heater(s) may not work (it didn't for us) so you might want to bring extra clothes.
Bring an extra roll of toilet paper, always have extra.
The road down to the treehouse is drivable for most cars, just go slow and you'll be fine.
The Wi-Fi is spotty at best and it didn't work for us, but it's nature so it won't hurt not having it.
The ladder is best suited for taller people, if you're short you will get that blood flowing.
Make sure the backpack you bring isn't a wide one since it might not fit through the floor hatch/door.
We enjoyed the experience and the architecture of course. If you're doing it for IG... this is for you. If you love nature and glamping... this is for you. Please believe if you're afraid of heights this is most certainly not for you. If you take your time to read the reviews you'll be fine.

The climb up and down can be a bit intimidating if youre scared of heights, but felt perfectly safe getting up and down the ladder. The pinecone itself is a beautiful structure and just fun to experience. It was a great night in the trees!"

Stayed a few nights","This was a very special treehouse. The location was perfect, the treehouse perched high in the Redwoods with the back deck west facing for some magical sunsets. The fog rolls into the mountain ridges and the tree lines for a truly mystical vibe. So peaceful!! The wrap around deck was furnished nicely with tables and chairs. The inside was well appointed and luxurious. Exceeded expectations and was extremely comfortable and cozy. The amenities were above and beyond, so many personal touches! The kitchen was nice for cooking some simple meals and fridge was a decent size. The treehouse was so nice and enjoyable we would have loved to prepare more meals and not go out. It took a little bit of skill in the kitchen to prepare some food with limited space and only one burner and the toaster did not work. Over all it was well stocked with pots and pans, silverware and dishes. Everything we needed was available. I would love to stay again, it was wonderful!"

Stayed a few nights","Very cool stay at Pacific View Treehouse! Pretty easy to find the location, just have to be looking out for the turn when driving down the winding highway. The place was something out of a fairytale. And not to mention super clean, easy to get into, and well outfitted with all basic amenities. Beautiful view from the deck that showcased foggy, misty hills in the evenings and early mornings, and illuminating blue skies on the green scenery by day. Not that much can be done for this, but my only wish is the road was out of sight/ear shot. Not particularly disturbing but noticeable.
Overall wonderful place to stay, we really enjoyed our time and experience. Jan provided a nice, extensive list of different to-dos in the area which was especially helpful for finding food and hikes. This list was provided once the reservation was confirmed so we knew well in advance different options in the area. 10/10 would stay again!"

The seating areas on the balcony were wonderful for enjoying the views during meals. The fireplace in the bedroom was perfect for the cold nights and was surprisingly powerful! Jan provided some thoughtful recommendations for hikes nearby. Her directions came in clutch because google maps took us in the wrong direction. And shout out to the Logan who was quick to help us when we accidentally locked ourselves out of the outhouse haha

Stayed a few nights","The PVT is a really nice treehouse. Having never stayed in one, I do not have a point of comparison, but this one is really nice. It is small, but every inch of the tree house is well utilized. It was a little difficult to have to use the bathroom separate from the treehouse, but I understand why that was done. The staircase is very steep and probably wouldn't be good for large or unfit people. The bedroom window did not have a curtain on the side facing residences, but we hung up a blanket. I don't want those points to take away from a great a novel experience. This tree house is really nice and the location is peaceful and quiet and the host was super helpful and responsive. I would book this place again if I wanted to experience a tree house."

Stayed a few nights","Bucket List - YES !!! We stayed two nights at PVT and LOVED every minute! The location is gorgeous. We drove up from Los Angeles and the last 30 minutes driving past O'Neill Forebay and the San Luis Reservoir and the green hills was such a nice entrance for this scenic getaway. The treehouse is in a small grove of redwoods and looks out over a huge meadow with an incredible view. We enjoyed many hours on the balcony - playing board games, talking, watching hawks circling over the meadow, and soaking up the panoramic view and breathing the fresh air. We wanted to maximize our time in the treehouse, so we brought our food with us. We appreciated the mini fridge, microwave and dishes. We watched movies at night and the heater kept us cozy. We also drove to Mt. Madonna County Park, which was just up the road, and went hiking one weekday. We had the trail to ourselves and were thrilled to hike in the redwoods. PVT is classy! Every detail of PVT was perfect and we hope to return!"

Stayed one night","PVT was such an amazing experience. I took my visiting boyfriend who’s not from the area to show off the beauty of California and the treehouse did just that. The architecture, design, and decor did not disappoint. I made the unfortunate decision to arrive after sunset, which I would not recommend, however the host was extremely helpful to provide direction because it does get pretty dark at night. Temperature does get rather cold, but the heater upstairs keeps the bedroom nook pretty toasty. I would recommend to keep cooking expectations to a minimum. If there was a mini toaster oven/ air fryer that would’ve made toasting my bagel bites better than microwaving them lol. All in all, pretty awesome experience and the views are just immaculate!!"

Once we arrived and saw the property everything was just as described, and BETTER!!! They did a great job having everything we needed, even board games and wonderfully smelling scented candles, great touch! This place did not miss with the details or the thoughtfulness. If you can’t tell we ENJOYED PVT! You won’t be disappointed. I would recommend grabbing some snacks/food before your drive up.

The views were immaculate and the location is completely private. The attention to detail was astounding, from the green details throughout the house to the local soaps and wax melts given, we could tell how much love and effort was put into this treehouse. We loved the games and had a great time enjoying the peace and quiet. We drove 10 mins down the hill and grabbed Cassidy’s Pizza for dinner, so close and convenient and recommend for anyone staying who wants an easy to-go meal. :)"

Kitchen was extremely well-stocked, could have cooked multiple gourmet meals there. Indoor/outdoor space with jacuzzi was awesome. And most of all can't beat the location. Quiet neighborhood but still walking distance to the Boardwalk, beach, and amazing views on west cliff drive."

Stayed with kids","Great place to stay. Very clean, couches and beds were comfortable. You can walk to the boardwalk if you’re determined, but it’s 3/4 mile, so we drove and paid to park since we have two small kids. Wonderful location for a morning jog, as you can go straight east until you hit the ocean, and wrap around to the south along the coast until Lighthouse beach, and then straight back north for a great little 1 mile loop. Outdoor shower was great after long sandy beach days. The kids had fun playing in the gated front yard while we relaxed on the porch. The front bedroom gets A TON of light in the morning through the skylight, so make sure a morning person is in that room. We will stay here again!"

The quality of the communal areas of the house are also very nice. The bed in the 3rd bedroom is essentially just a mattress on the floor so ok for young kids but not very comfortable for adults at all. The quality of all beds, bedding and the bathroom (water pressure poor / blocked drains) are not as perfect as the living areas of the home - they need a little more TLC for the price point of this property. Overall a nice property we were just expecting a little more for the price."

Stayed with kids","This place is great! Prime location, very clean, easy check-in, fast communication, and perfect for our family of 4. We got in late and the place was easy to find and check-in. There was even a supply of Keurig k-cups so we were able to have coffee the next day before hitting the grocery store. We walked everywhere. It’s 15-20 minutes to almost everything in town that you’d want to do. This town is made for walking and biking! We came for mountain biking and discovered a trail just a few minutes away to put us on a safe route to hit Wilder Ranch. And it has a couple of lemon trees in the yard which is what we love about California! We were able to make the 16 hour drive in 1 day from Seattle to get warm weather and sun. We definitely recommend this house and Santa Cruz!"

My wife and I walked out the door, and found some competitive doubles volleyball across the street, while the kids hit the beach. The house had some really fun bicycles, and then also a plethora of surf boards. My daughter and I went back out to the beach after dinner and there was a fun band playing. Just the right mix of solitude at the place and people and things to do steps away."

This house was absolutely gorgeous!! It looked even better than the pictures. So modern, comfortable and clean. The balconies have perfect beach views. The living room downstairs has a remote that makes a large flatscreen rise up out of a hidden place that was perfect for movie night. There is really great heating in the home, and the bathroom flooring is heated. The beds were so comfortable. Plentiful linens, towels, pillows, soaps, and blankets. There were enough electric bikes for us all to go cruise around town which was so much fun, I couldn't be happier we got that unexpected experience!! There were also paddle boards, surf boards,and kayaks (which I will have to try next time) We had a wonderful time and will definitely plan to come back. Anyone who stays here will love it. 10/10 would recommend!! Thank you Evan for being the best host, and making us feel right at home. You're awesome!!

The house is on a quiet street and the backyard was great for hanging out and for our dog to run around. Pleasure Point is a great place to walk along the ocean and watch the surfers. Jackie is an excellent host--always friendly and responsive, and she kindly left us a welcome gift and a toy for our dog. I highly recommend Jackie's place and hope to be able to come back for another stay!"

She recently upgraded the pots and pans and also installed a new oven/range. She is literally the perfect host! Kind, helpful, loves to provide suggestions, and most of all she is super responsive to anything we might need.
We adore this home too! Jackie keeps it scent free which is a blessing to us and to anyone that has chemical and fragrance sensitivities. None of that stinky stuff here! The home is darling, from the front yard-through the home-and into the enjoyable backyard. everything is a treat and is everything that we could ask for.
But wait... there's more! The location! Very close to the beaches along Pleasure Point. We could sit out there all day and watch the waves-surfers-seals-otters-etc. Get a breakfast burrito at the market too! Heaven! The area is very walkable too. Nice homes to admire. Enjoy!!!!!"

Jackie has done a fantastic job to offer her home to vacationers. It's the perfect size for us, and is simply a joy to stay in. Coffee in the morning, lunch on the back patio, evening cocktail on the front porch, dinner at the table... walk to the beach... it's all perfect!
The best part of this home is that it's scent-free! So many other vacation homes that we have stayed in stink to high heaven! The overpowering smell of cleaners, air ""fresheners"", dryer sheets, scented soap, and all kinds of other chemical-based products hit you as soon as you open the door. But not here! Jackie maintains a 100% scent-free home, which is a blessing to people like us that have chemical and fragrance sensitivities. We love that Jackie values these things!

We loved our stay here within walkable distance of everything. The huge plus for us was that the place is pristine clean, has SO many wonderful little touches (dog bowls, delicious coffee, warm blankets for breezy nights, modern kitchen, cute decor, endless really). We were here as a couple visiting friends in Santa Cruz, golfing, and just generally relaxing with our dog while our house had some work done it. However, would love to bring our 2 yr old grandson some day as Jackie had a cute wagon filled with sand toys, a high chair, safety plugs on all the outlets, and lawn chairs available for guests. You will feel fully pampered at this darling place!

The beach house was awesome, clean, and just as described. Great private backyard, perfect for grilling while the kids play in the grass. Having access to bikes, beach toys, and a wagon made trips to the beach a breeze (along with the outdoor shower for keeping the sand outside).

Stayed with a pet",we stayed here for 3 nights with our two Yorkie poos for a long weekend. we loved it! our favorite thing was probably the fenced in backyard because our puppies could run and play. they were so happy! they also loved the toys that the host left as a gift for them! the house itself is super cute and very spacious. everything looks like it is from a magazine! the kitchen is pretty well stocked with dishes. there are lots of boardgames to play. I only slept in the bed in the room with the backdoor but it was really comfortable. the sofa is big and comfortable too. the outside area is really nice in the back with chairs and a firepit and there is also a nice porch on the front. there is a driveway to park in. the beach is walking distance. I don't think it's even two blocks away. there is a convenience store by the beach. there are also lots of little local restaurants nearby. the neighborhood itself is super cute and quiet. lots of nice beaches nearby. I would def stay again!

The house is comfy/adorable with a well appointed kitchen and great outdoor space to hang out and do all the pre/post surf things. Traveling with kids, she has a pack and play, booster seat, kid friendly table ware, a folding wagon, and all the sand things already at the house. Easy walk to surf, playground, coffee and restaurants or even quicker on one of the beach cruisers at the house. Jackie is super kind and easy to interact with.

Not only the house was in great condition but all the amenities were in great shape! Traveling with 2 dogs means having to cook in the house I stay in so it’s really important to me to rent a house with a good working kitchen and good pots and pans, etc. All kitchen amenities were more than I could’ve asked for! The location was perfect in a quiet neighborhood and we just loved every second of it. The outdoor shower came in handy many times after a fun filled day at the beach! We had a wonderful time and we’ll be back!! Thank you Jackie for being a wonderful host and allowing us to enjoy your beautiful home! 🐾🐶"

Stayed with a pet","This is a fabulous house in a fabulous location. The house is beautifully set up with really nice quality items and perfectly laid out. The garden is delightful - we and our dog spent a lot of time just enjoying the sunshine there.
The location is hard to beat. It’s a short walk to the beach - great early morning walk for the dog when the tide is low - as well as the cliff top walk. There are plenty of shops and restaurants in easy walking distance - we had a lovely meal at Suda, excellent breakfast burritos from the local market, and delicious ice cream from Pennys.
Jackie is easy to reach and responds quickly - we had a couple of questions that she answered right away.
We were so sad to leave this sunny gem and head back into cold and windy San Francisco. We will definitely be back!"

Stayed with kids","We LOVE Santa Cruz and we LOVE this location. Pleasure Point is the perfect distance to both the Boardwalk and then over to Capitola. Having the coffee shops, restaurants, ect on 41st is great so you can stay on foot or bike as much as possible. You will love how the house is just blocks away from the beach and strolling along the East Cliffs.
Jackie has thought through so much with how the house is appointed from the linens and kitchen to the bikes, beach towels and sand toys. We brought a toddler on the trip with us - she explored the fenced in and safe backyard and loved finding ""hidden"" seashells.
Having stayed in SC and spent $400+/night for a hotel - the freedom and flexibility the house provides is a HUGE value."

The weather didn't allow us to enjoy the beach as much as we would have liked, but we would love to stay here again and use the great beach gear (bikes! chairs!) available. Jackie's home had everything we needed to cook a few meals, and enjoy our time together. The outside shower was fantastic to hose off our feet and wash off our dog so that we didn't track sand indoors, and the bed was so cozy that it was hard to get up in the morning. Communication with Jackie was pleasant, quick, and easy, and we had no issues with anything during our stay. Loved it!"

Stayed with kids","Jackie’s home is an absolute dream. It’s all been re-done, and everything is intuitive and just seems to work. From the linen duvets to the luxurious bath products to the bevy of beach gear, everything has been thought of and provided. Jackie was super easy to communicate with and I’m sure would have been helpful if we’d needed anything, which of course we did not, because everything was already there.
Regarding location: the house is absolutely walking distance from the beach! I was worried that close to water would not mean close to beach access, but there is a great kid beach you can walk to (and of course, pleasure point for surfing).
Best advice: don’t sleep on the outdoor shower! It is amazing, especially after a day at the beach!"

Backyard fire pit to keep warm on cool and breezy nights. Plus a local host who is willing to help with the things you need.

The beach supplies are amazing - we used the beach chairs, beach towels and umbrellas. Bikes, kids toys and wagons looked great as well (though we didn't use them). And it's a great location.
The host sent a text to welcome us and offer to help with anything. And another text the next day to let us know we could ask if we needed anything. So she made it clear she was available but didn't keep texting.

Very pet friendly with easy access to beaches and hikes. Bikes were fun to use and cruise up and down the cliff tops.

It was really clean, it had everything we needed from soap to boogie boards and everything in between. The yard was gorgeous and inviting. We would live in this house all the time if we could!"

Stayed with kids","We had a wonderful stay at Jackie's beach house, and had everything we needed. Homes in Santa Cruz can be quite small but Jackie's place felt spacious and the yard was large enough for my son and our dog. everything was spotless, the beds were comfy, the entire house was beautifully decorated and located walking distance to Pleasure Point and the market. We would not hesitate to stay again and Jackie was such a kind host. She checked in with us to see that we had everything we needed and even left my dog a Kong toy (and us a bottle of wine, which was the perfect temp in the wine fridge!). We can't wait to stay again."

Sizeable kitchen with a variety of cooking supplies - all the necessities for us to make some meals - and ample seating. The full laundry room, board games, Disney+ Premium, beach cruisers and toys (including wagon to haul them) plus fenced backyard with firepit, hammock, outdoor shower, and grill puts this place over the top. Seriously, everything if well thought out to make things easy and comfortable. Don't miss the burritos at the Point market or little surf shop and Chinese on the main drag. Near shopping if you forget something. Thanks for a great surf staycation!"

Stayed a few nights","We originally re-booked Jackie's Seacliff Family Beach House because we loved it (and highly recommend it as well) but in deciding to bring our small dog this time, ended up checking out The Pleasure Point Beach House and had an amazing stay! From booking to departure, Jackie was a wonderful host again, kind and responsive, checking in to make sure we had everything we needed. As with the other house, the Pleasure Point Beach House was super clean, beautifully furnished and stocked with everything we needed. We loved the calm and relaxing modern beach decor, the gorgeous kitchen which made preparing a meal as enjoyable as enjoying takeout from the many delicious options in the area, the super comfortable beds, the great shower water pressure, the lovely backyard which our 5 year old and our dog enjoyed, the location in a safe and quiet neighborhood, and the walking distance proximity to an easy and wonderful walk along the ocean from which we enjoyed watching the surfers. Thoughtful touches such as a storybook collection, games and child-friendly dinnerware made the stay extra special for our little one. It felt like a true home. All in all, we loved our stay and highly recommend both listings!"

The house was very kid friendly. The kitchen was stocked with kids plates and utensils. There were kid books, games and an awesome enclosed back yard with a fire pit. Although we didn’t get a chance to use them, the house also had 5 beach cruisers and beach supplies.
We would definitely come back and stay here again! Thank you to the host, Jackie."

Stayed over a week","Such an incredible spot for so many reasons!! First and foremost, the location couldn't be better. You are a very very short walk away from the ocean and multiple surf spots, the point market - the best place for breakfast burritos, coffee at Cat & Cloud - a great local coffee shop, 7-eleven, sandy beaches for a picnic, the main 41st street with multiple shops and restaurants, and many other spots. If you're a surfer, you'll realize there is quite nothing like WALKING out of the house with your board and jumping straight into the water. Secondly, the amenities are vast - you've got a place to park your car, a large backyard with a gas grill, firepit, and most importantly a hot outdoor shower. The place has everything to make you feel right at home - super comfy beds, a wine fridge, laundry, and a fully stocked kitchen. We would stay here again in a heartbeat, heck I'd spend my whole summer here if I could!"

There are beach cruisers provided (which were an unexpected surprise!). We were able to log into our Netflix account to watch movies in the evening. She had several board games available as well.

Stayed a few nights","This adorable beach house is so awesome I'm actually afraid to say how good it is because it's bound to become so popular! From the moment we booked, Jackie was proactive in communicating with us. Upon our arrival we checked in with ease and found the house in pristine condition, something that I can attest is extremely rare in Santa Cruz, having lived there for eight years. We were delighted to find a kitchen fully furnished with cookware, utensils, cutlery, dishware and glasses, gas range and oven, dishwasher, nice refrigerator, and a built-in wine and beer fridge under the counter! Modern laundry machines that worked great. TV was set up with streaming services and a sound bar that also had bluetooth connectivity for listening to music from our phones. Comfortable furniture in the living room and two bedrooms with very supportive, comfy beds. Bathroom was very clean and in great condition, with a big rain shower head and plenty of clean towels in the linen closet. Bonus points for the deluxe toilet paper! Radiant heater quickly took the edge off of the morning chill. Several beach cruisers in the garage that we didn't end up using, but all appeared to be in great condition. Nice front porch for relaxing with a couple of comfy chairs. All windows were double pane, opened easily, and latched securely. Wood floors looked original and were in excellent condition. Lots of fun artwork around the house with a beach theme. Ample driveway could likely fit multiple cars, nice to have off street parking. Nice, mellow neighborhood that is two short blocks from Pleasure Point, a very popular local surf spot with a market that has amazing breakfast burritos! I really can't say enough about how wonderful it was to stay in this house. Choose Jackie's Pleasure Point Beach House when you're visiting Santa Cruz!"

First thing in the morning, we would walk down to watch the surfers at Pleasure Point while we collected sea shells in the tide pools. We were able to use Jackie's beach cruisers to ride down to the cute shops and delicious eateries on 41st. Amazing! In the evenings, we would rinse our sandy selves in the outdoor shower and enjoy the fire pit in the large backyard. We enjoyed our stay 100% and hope to be back soon!"

It is extremely well stocked with beach supplies, bikes, towels, board games, and kitchen supplies. It’s modern and stylish but also easy to have young kids in this space. My kids loved running around the large backyard and playing in the hammock. Jackie, the host, is very quick to respond to any questions. We love this place and hope to stay again soon!"

If you are trying to de-stress, need a quiet space for recharging between your exploring Santa Cruz, or just need a chill place to relax at the end of day, this fits its bill as a place for meditation. Rub the lavender and rosemary between your fingers. Feed the friendly koi carp. Or just sit back in your chair by the koi pond and listen to the windchimes thrum in the gentle breezes off Monterey Bay. Highly recommend this place, and look forward to staying again the next time I visit my family in town."

On the property the garden area with its babbling pond was absolutely beautiful and a very relaxing place to eat a meal. The bedroom has a separate entrance on the side of the house through the shared garden and feels very private. The kitchenette with a minifridge, microwave, and coffeemaker in the repurposed half of the closet was clutch for eating on a budget. I never met Diana - she was out of town for the majority of my stay - but she was responsive on the app, and I had everything I needed anyways.

We both greatly appreciated the natural light in the room, as well as the soothing sounds of wind chimes and water flowing throughout the day. One small cautionary note for travelers, which only applies if you intend to be trekking around the area (like we had to): Lyft / Uber are not terribly present in this part of Santa Cruz, it seems. We had a very difficult time getting timely or reliable pick-ups through either service. To reiterate: we loved the room itself -- just make sure you have your travel well-planned in advance (a rented car might be wisest)."

We were able to walk to Natural Bridges, enjoy dinner at a nearby brewery, and walk back along the coastline from the boardwalk! I would recommend Diana’s place to anyone! Can’t wait to make our way back!"

The garden, with its thoughtful plantings and trickling koi pond is a treasure, the bed was fabulously comfy, and the entire space felt relaxed and peaceful. The location is terrific, in a quiet, safe neighborhood close to West Cliff and Natural Bridges, and a short walk from cafes, restaurants, and grocery shopping. I would love to stay here again!"

West Cliff Dr. was 2 blocks for a beautiful ocean walk, bike or sit and It's not a bad walk to a wonderful coffee cafe called Cat & Cloud. Couldn't be a better location and I can't wait to stay again ~ Thanks Diana! Sisters, Desi & Debi"

It could not have been more quiet, beautiful, and what a deal!! Walking distance to the beach.

Diana and Arthur's AirBnB has many thoughtful touches. They've left chocolate, have a refrigerator, food to feed the fish, coffe and tea, even a Britta filter for water. The bed is very comfortable and there are extra towels if you need them. Light sleepers should install a white noise app or bring noise cancelling head phones. Their home is NOT noisy but the room is connected to the house so there is a bit of natural blending of noises that happens. Parking is free and plentiful and the neighborhood is safe and friendly.
My only true complaint? I did not get to meet their feline guardian... next time!"

Stayed a few nights","I enjoyed my stay at Diana's place. The room was very clean and the koi pond was such a nice touch. The location is unbeatable, it's only about 3-5 min walk away from the ocean. I got to go on a few hikes which are the main reason for my trip. I'd recommend it to anyone who looks for a quiet and beautiful place to unwind."

Stayed a few nights",Diana’s place is lovely. It is quiet and comfortable. The little “kitchenette” in the closet had everything you need. The WiFi is great. I had to attend a zoom meeting one day and nothing went wrong. It is 2 to 3 blocks from west cliff drive and the trail. Walkable to natural bridges state beach. I would highly recommend it.

Stayed one night","Judith's place was exactly what we were looking for, as two friends needing a place for a night after a wedding at nearby Waterfall Lodge. Everything inside was as described and in perfect condition, with nice touches such as fresh coffee, shower amenities and nice decor. The only thing worth mentioning was that our (pre-arranged late) check-in was a bit of a nightmare, with the wrong code being given for the door and then no response from Judith for around 50 minutes at 11pm. We felt terrible having to knock on her door and wake her up (she lives next door) but this did eventually allow us to get inside with the correct code. Other than this mishap, all was great. Thank you so much and sorry again for having to wake you up."

This is a quiet neighborhood in a beautiful area and I would highly recommend this lovely place to stay. It made me realize what I have been missing by not visiting the Santa Cruz area more.

Stayed one night","A must stay location for the right amount of vacation. The way it is laid out makes it truly a unique and humble home away from home. You can be sure you’ll be warm or cool if needed anytime of the year. The outdoor space available including the pool and the scenery around cannot be matched by any hotel or luxury location. That’s my opinion. I went to college for a few years there and to come back with an impeccable level of customer service, going above and beyond, including a guide to the area with points of interests. Judith is a personal concierge (by her own graciousness) on top of being an amazing AirBnB host. Sincerely thank you for the opportunity to stay at your humble place. It was a home away from home to visit where my heart, including my friend Michael, left a little of ourselves behind."

She gave me great recommendations on good places to check out in town and I had a great time. The bestest of recs always comes from a local.
She is also very thoughtful, thorough, and detail oriented. This space is stand alone with lots of privacy, a kitchenette equipped with goodies for a quick morning snack, and a pool in the backyard if you’re into swimming and visit during the summer.
You’ll definitely leave this airbnb pleased and well rested. Bottom line, I felt very much at home and welcomed during my stay and will be coming back to her place if I’m ever in town again."

This tiny bungalow had everything an individual or couple could need, including impeccable cleanliness and little touches like compost, wall heater, built-in screened windows in the back door for secure cross breeze, powerful shower spray and ready hot water and more. We loved the pool, the nature surrounding it, the thick towels, the towering trees, ""shade"" umbrellas and solid lawn furniture. We found ourselves refreshed in every possible way. Thank you for opening your home to travelers like us and for helping us make fond memories! I highly recommend Scotts Valley Bungalow."

Not only is the location great, the neighborhood is quiet and cozy, and Judith’s welcoming amenities can’t be beat. The room was spotless and clean, with nearly any item you forgot to pack sitting there for you. For example it’s a small touch, but a fridge full of bottled waters was so helpful while on vacation! My partner and I enjoyed the pool in the gorgeous serene backyard, and had everything we need in this comfortable spot. Thank you Judith!!"

The neighborhood is quiet and only 10-15 minutes from Santa Cruz. I recommend a visit to the Henry Cowell Redwoods, the trails were lovely and a great workout. The MAH in Santa Cruz is worth a visit and tickets are donation-based (pay what you wish). The weather was amazing when we stayed in mid May. It’s a little warmer in Scott’s Valley than SC so bring summer clothes. There is no A/C but the fan works well to cool the room. We would definitely stay here again and plan to return later this year!"

You haven’t arrived when it says you have. The place was clean and well-equipped with plenty of towels, cutlery, and cleaning supplies. There was also an air filter. Toilet was one of the more eco-friendly ones that flush was a button that’s a little hard to press if you have long nails like I do, though. I also didn’t see Judith at all during my stay, which suited me just fine, and checking in and out was very convenient. Good vibes, v chill."
