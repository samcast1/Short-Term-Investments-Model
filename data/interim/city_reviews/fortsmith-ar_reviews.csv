Stayed a few nights","Great place all around! It is removed far enough from the main Avenue that you have peace, but close enough that access to food, shopping, and entertainment is just around the corner. I had to make a last-minute trip and had something come up. I contacted Luis, and he was extremely helpful and went out of his way to ease my situation. On top of it all, I didn't get in till later the first night and didn't grab food, but Luis saved the day, there were snacks and water. Not the most extravagant meal, but a saving grace nonetheless. Highly recommended if you need to stay in the area."

Bonus, Creekmore Park is practically across the street and it is a MUST. This park was not well advertised and it’s impressive. Better than the one on the river even.
Thanks to Luis our trip to Ft Smith was perfect."

Mattresses were comfortable and the kitchen has everything you need to cook a meal. Water pressure in the shower was amazing and we will definitely be staying here again the next time we need to come to Fort Smith.
Note the neighborhood does look a bit sketch when you roll in but we felt safe overall and the neighborhood was actually pretty quiet. For the price this was a great stay."

Stayed a few nights","The place was great. I’m a Fort Smith, Arkansas native that was home for the Christmas holdiay. Prior to booking, I had asked if I could bring my service animal that would be well monitored, crated, cleaned up after, but most importantly - needed a backyard to accomodate him. Emily responsed yes and I booked immediately. The place was clean, had very nice decor, TVs, & snacks. Emily even followed up to a question while in labor. Great host!
My only note for furture bookers who might be traveling in & arrive early unintentionally - is that the digital pad didn’t recognize my code til after check-in time (post 3p)."

Helpful hosts, clear instructions and suggestions, communication was awesome and not a single problem during my two night stay. Also, not many check out chores which is always nice when living life on the road to our next temporary destination and made for an easy check out by 11 am. Will stay again! Thanks for having us. Next time, we use the grill!! We even had the chance to take advantage of the deep set tub! Cleanliness was untouchable! We’ll be back! Til next time 💖"

She responded immediately when I had a question and provided a detailed guide for the home and surrounding area. There was ample parking for our vehicle and motorcycle trailer. It's a gorgeous area to ride! We are already planning a return trip for the fall time and will gladly refer friends to Emily's property! We ate dinner at Bricktown Brewery, Fuji Japanese Steakhouse, and Joe's Grill and Cantina, all of which we recommend."

House is in a nice quiet neighborhood that felt safe and despite being next to the Airport, noise was not a problem. Home came well stocked with everything we needed and more. Beds were comfy and appropriately stocked with blankets and pillows. Kitchen was great and had everything we needed to grill out our first night and make side dishes. Outside space is lovely and was a perfect backdrop for a quieter evening."

Stayed one night","This place is a little higher than other in the area but well worth the extra 30$ or 40$ !! Everything actually looked like the pics! The fireplace is nice touch! Because of the ice my wife slipped and fell earlier that evening, so the hot tub was a nice for the muscles! It was underneath the stars had a brisk 12°! The bed was small but super comfortable. I slept like a baby don’t even remember waking up! And as for my wife, she was snoring by the end of night! We actually overslept! The living room area is actually My favorite. It was separated, brother, the rest of the house yet connected to the fireplace.!! Everything was brand new top-of-the-line and will be staying back at this house if we’re ever back in Fort Smith! ! I never give five stars either!! I’m pretty up front but this house I really can’t find a complaint on !! This one is perfect!!"

Stayed with a pet","This house was adorable! The kitchen and living spaces are done so well. It’s very livable and great for visiting with family and friends. There is a Roku Tv in the living room so you don’t necessarily have to log in and remember to log out of any of your streaming services. Kitchen was well-equipped and the outdoor space is excellent!
We loved the see-through gas fireplace but had no idea how to use it and there were no instructions.
The lighting in the bathroom is bad. There are Edison bulbs over the sink and no overhead light. For my elderly father, he said the shower was so dark he could hardly see. It’s impossible to put your make up on in either bathroom because the lighting is so poor.
The beds are adequate. The bunk bed is not made for an adult, obviously, so the mattress isn’t the best. But is fine for a few nights.
I would absolutely stay here again because the kitchen, living areas, and outdoor space."

The convenience of being near the airport was a major plus. It made my travel arrangements smooth and stress-free. Despite the proximity to the airport, the area was surprisingly quiet and peaceful.
Mariyem's thoughtfulness truly stood out, as soon as I needed assistance she sent someone to help us out within 30 mins!
It's evident that she takes pride in ensuring her guests have an exceptional stay, and I couldn't have asked for a better experience."

After a long day of roadtripping, we had plans to go out and look for a cute local restaurant. Instead, we were within staggering distance to Las Americas (?) restaurant where we drowned our traffic stress in chips and delicious margaritas then staggered back to our luxury bedrooms and passed out. I slept HARD in total silence. In the morning I had to take pictures of the pillow brand because I need them for my house. Grandma took pictures of the cushy towels. The next two nights we're in different hotels on our road trip, and I wish so badly we were still at The Porches."

Group trip","Clean, comfortable beds, good location. Fort Smith has some great restaurants. However, would not recommend for more than a couple or for more than a couple of days. We have stayed in at least 35 Air BnB properties and this is the least customer aware we’ve encountered. Amenities are at a minimum, no wine glasses, no clothes hangers in the upstairs closets. As the house rules state clearly you get a starter set of kitchen soaps, one packet of dishwasher powder, for instance, yet you are asked to start the dishwasher before you leave. A 5 night stay."

We've stayed in multiple units here over the last year or so (this was the first time in a 4BR) and EVERY SINGLE STAY has been PERFECT! The units are ALWAYS SPOTLESS, the appointments are exactly as described and pictured. The location is a longer drive from OUR destination while visiting, but we book it without hesitation each time and are never disappointed. There is an AMAZING park within walking distance, and a small mall area with nice restaurants and cafes walkable as well. All in all, it's a FANTASTIC location and always a great stay!"

The 4 bedrooms - each with ensuite baths allow for 8 people to stay without feeling over crowded. The only issue we had was the difficulty the AC had keeping up on very hot days in Fort Smith...but this can be adjusted, and we would have no issue staying at this property again. Overall - a great property."

The house faces a beautiful shared courtyard, and all of the neighbors were friendly and welcoming. If you intend to cook, bring some staples…there are pots and pans and a good coffee-maker, but it’s not set up with a full pantry or spice rack. We were extremely pleased with the host’s responsiveness and with the rental overall."

Stayed with kids","Erica's place was better than we had hoped because it was hard to tell the size of the living area from the photos, and we were concerned it would be too small for our group. It was not! The back porches that fed into all the other back porches and grass area were a hit. We had multiple houses booked between friends and family for a wedding and it was so sweet to get to see everyone hanging out and easy to talk to everyone. And in the early morning, the sunrise is so pretty and it's so peaceful. At night, the torch lights were gorgeous on all the houses. The house was very clean and furnished well downstairs. The upstairs bedrooms lacked furniture, interestingly enough, but the en suite bathrooms for every bedroom are a huge plus. We really enjoyed our stay and thought the area was super charming. The only downsides (and they were minor): no extra blankets for those who got cold at night and a fan in one of the upstairs rooms wasn't working."

They responded within SECONDS of us reaching out to them and moved us to this property, which was bigger than the one we were initially set to stay in. Only 2 of us stayed the night, but Saturday we had a group of girls over to get ready for a wedding and also did photos there. The house was PERFECT and the front porch/lawn was perfect for bridals.

My only real concern is that the home is in close proximity to some train tracks, which meant being woken up early by train horns blowing. This may be a consideration for light sleepers. Other than that, my family was very pleased! Such a great deal for a modernly decorated and newly renovated home :)"

However, I was pleasantly surprised to find kid friendly dishes in the listing. This became part of our decision when narrowing down places to stay for this trip. Fast forward to our arrival, we were pleased to find furniture in the home that is also toddler friendly. The home is clean and hosts have put a lot of thought into their amenities. Thank you for thinking of our little people and providing small things that make traveling with toddlers and other small children just a little easier."

Their home gives a very unique family vibe with a bit of an edge! I absolutely love this house! Plenty of space and very neatly organized! Great snacks were provided as a welcome gift! They also give awesome recommendations (free and paid) for the area. So no worries about trying to figure out what to do, there’s plenty in the great city of Fort Smith. Even if you decide to stay at the house to chill, they provide games. So again, no worries!!!
I know for sure I’ll reserve this home again for my next trip back to Arkansas.
Don’t miss your opportunity to book with this outstanding family!!!

It has a well stocked kitchen, comfortable beds, and a great little outdoors space. We loved that there was a desk for our computer. The bathroom and shower are especially nice! Emily is a great host!! We would highly recommend staying with her and look forward to returning in the future!!"

Group trip","Utica has been perfectly updated. We had 5 adults with plenty of space!! Sharing a bathroom was easy. That had been the only concern and it ended up not being a problem at all. It was cozy and clean . Everything we needed was provided. We were there for 10 days and it felt like home after the first night. Staying with family for that long can be exhausting, even when you LOVE them. Having our own place to call home (we actually referred to it as Utica) made our trip the best ever. Oh, there is also a covered patio area that was perfect for drinking coffee in the mornings!!! Quiet neighbors too. Thank you for a wonderful experience."

The location was perfect, convenient to everywhere, and the neighborhood was quiet. The home is beautifully decorated. Beds and pillows were comfortable. A few nice touches... Games and toys for little ones and family games. Extra blankets. The kitchen was the best stocked of any Airbnb we've stayed. You can play your favorite music from the speaker in the shower. We highly recommend staying here. You will not be disappointed!"

It was a little hard to find because access isn’t direct from a street. You have to turn down a short alleyway to get there. However, don’t let that discourage you from staying here.
This would be a good place to come and stay a while.

The property itself was impeccably maintained and beautifully decorated, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere that made it feel like a home away from home.
Rebecca was an exceptional host, consistently communicative and responsive throughout my stay. From the moment I booked, she provided detailed information and was readily available to answer any questions I had. Her attention to detail and genuine hospitality truly set the tone for a fantastic experience.
The location was perfect, providing a peaceful retreat while still being conveniently close to local attractions and amenities. The accommodations were comfortable, clean, and thoughtfully equipped with everything needed for a stress-free stay.
Overall, my stay at Rebecca's place was wonderful, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a top-notch Airbnb experience in Fort"

Stayed a few nights","*I privately communicated this to hosts & was ignored so I have recanted my decision to refrain from a public review*
After two nights at another of the hosts' places, I booked this place b/c the weather was still bad. The back door wouldn't lock and was being pushed open by the wind. I pushed a chair up to it until it could be fixed, but for two days my dog, my belongings, and I were in a place I couldn't lock up. I didn't have much of a choice.
This was after the stay at the other place where the heater
heater broke upon checkin (during freezing weather and ice covered streets). I was fine with space heaters (I get it), but I couldn't leave my dog in the house with the heaters on during the day (as suggested) so I took him to my house & put him in a bedroom while I worked (the point of booking was to separate my male from my female in heat - I couldn't get him to the boarding facility b/c of the weather). I slept in my coat.
No acknowledgment from hosts. Very disappointed."

Stayed a few nights","Plenty about this place I liked. Good neighborhood, quiet, no noise from others in the triplex. Big TV and comfy couch. clean towels and sheets.
Had hiccups with the HVAC unit though. It is just that style machine I'm not a fan of because often you set it but it doesn't actually blow warm even though it's on the sun setting for heat etc. Then after doing it several times to same setting, eventually it'll take. (other airbnbs I had same issue with this type unit)
Unfortunately the beds primarily kept me from giving rating 5 star. The king bed was soft but very saggy, I couldn't handle it. The queen bed was better...it was more supportive firm with softness but it had lumpy areas so took while each night to find a grove I could rest reasonably in."

Stayed a few nights","I came from Amarillo, Texas to spend a few days with my teenaged granddaughters. Rebekah's place was clean and cozy with everything we needed. I cooked a lot for the girls--the kitchen had everything I needed and was easy to work in. Even though the place is small, it doesn't feel small at all! Maximum use of every bit of space without clutter.
The back gate didn't latch, and I would have felt better if I could have shut and locked it. Other than that, we had three very nice vehicles out front for four nights without incident, and I walked in the neighborhood every day without any problems.
I hope to stay again and again when I visit my girls!"

Stayed a few nights","Having travelled through 5 states to arrive at the ParkHill Studio we appreciated how easy it was to access the studio, check in, and get settled. Our trip was not a vacation but due to a family emergency, so we ended up extending our stay twice and were grateful to be able to move to another unit in the same building for the remainder of our visit. Our hosts were very helpful and responsive to our needs at all times, eliminating more stress from an already stressful personal situation. The accommodations were exactly as described and very clean and comfortable. Thank you, Rebekah, Sarah, Tedd & Emily! Special thanks to Sarah for quickly responding to our unanticipated need to extend our stay!"

My wife and I were in town waiting for the birth and adoption of our daughter, and Sarah met us the first day with a baby gift and several helpful recommendations. We were both overwhelmed by the kindness. They also went out of there to get us a package that arrived after our stay ended. This was by far the best host team I have encountered on Airbnb. The house was also exactly as described and close to several great restaurants. Green Papaya was our favorite. We highly recommend this house. Thanks again!"

Stayed a few nights","The house was great. I have 0 complaints about that. But the issue was with the host. I was in town for work. I booked the whole week with intentions of staying all week. But the job I was sent to town to do was not ready for me. So I was sent back home. I paid for the reservation with per diem. My company is now requesting the per diem back and tedd and Emily refuse to give me a refund. I even just asked for a reduced refund. I paid $375 for the whole week and I only asked for $200 back for the inconvenience and they still refused. Terrible hosts. Never again. Inconsiderate, cold hearted people. Never stay at any of their properties."

It felt like we were in a friend's home, super cozy! the only criticism I have (minor) is the main heat/air was in the living room, so it took a while for the apartment to warm up but once it did it was fine. This is a perfect spot if you're looking for a 2 bedroom airbnb"

My only suggestion to the owners would be to do some sort of air filtration, as it smelt of stale cigarette smoke. The owners were great with communication and overall it was an easy stay. The bed is really comfortable too!"

The place is always clean when we stay there, and Rob and Melissa are great at communicating with you if you have any questions or concerns. If you need a place to feel safe and get some rest before a day of traveling, stay here!"

Stayed one night","The place is described very well by the hosts. Communication was great and when they found out I wasn’t traveling with a pet as initially planned, they initiated a refund for that portion of my rate. The location is easy to get to, easy access to I 40 and near restaurants. The best part of the stay was the bed, it was very comfortable. The cleanliness is hard to rate. While some things seemed very clean, the unit as a whole could use a deep cleaning. Overall, with the price in consideration, it’s a pretty good stay. Especially if you are mainly interested in a place to sleep. I will say that the food smells coming from the adjoining unit are very strong and if you’re sensitive to that, this place may not work for you. I found that keeping the bathroom door closed seemed to help."

If I was going to give any kind of feedback to help the hosts is that the place could use a few minor touch ups and a really good dusting. Also, the lights around the doorway, as well as, the solar security light would not come on, so that might need to be changed.
Overall, still a 5 star stay, in my opinion! Especially for the price!"

The best thing was the free pizza... BUT, the place was dingy, needed new paint, new furniture, and the computer desk didn't have a proper outlet.
The bathroom cabinet was filthy, unsafe electric: 2 prong outlets, a three prong outlet had extension cord with multiple appliances and it was stretched out so it hung in the air. This is a basement room that should either be condemned or totally refurbished. Very disappointed with everything except the hot water and free pizza. We couldn't wait to leave and would have not even stayed, but it was too late at night to get another place."

The massage chair is a very cool perk. The kitchen is large and has been remodeled. There could be bar stools for the kitchen counter, a bbq and a few other things for the kitchen. The floor is tile throughout the house and is cold in the winter so bring slippers or extra socks. Overall we were very pleased with Josh and his house and would stay again.

Stayed with kids","We absolutely loved staying at this house while here for my father in law’s funeral. The home is just as beautiful as the pictures, and I so enjoyed using the gorgeous kitchen. The massage chair was the extra touch that really made this place perfect for our situation. Josh was very responsive and resolved a small issue within minutes. This was just the reprieve our family needed, and I would recommend it to anyone staying in the area. Definitely deserving of all 5 stars!"

Stayed with kids","Our family of 5 stayed for 3 nights and it was perfect! The house was beautiful, spotless & they had lots of games for us to play with the kids. We were nervous how traveling with a 2 year old would be, but the pac & play fit perfectly in the 1st bedroom(we just slid the closet doors open and put it against the closet). That room was the darkest & he slept so good! We loved that the home didn’t have a lot of stuff he could get into or break. Right after we checked out, I realized I left my ring in the bathroom, and josh responded back immediately to help us get it. Thank you so much Josh. We will def will be staying here again!"

Group trip","Josh's house was beatiful, extremely clean, and close to stores and places to eat . The house was perfect for a get away with three teens. The kitchen was amazing and allowed us to cook meals and bake easily. It's close enough you can drive to Branson or explore the Orark trails and mountains. Josh was super nice and quick to respond to any questions We have family close by so we will definitely reserve this house again in the future."

Stayed with kids","We came to town for my mothers funeral. The house was immaculate & large enough for the whole family. Josh provided us with all we’d need and more; from towels, board games, pots/pans, extra blankets and pillows, even bottled water! The neighbors were kind and quiet, the house was very close to many restaurants and stores! Josh was quick to respond to any questions we had. We truly enjoyed our stay and it was mainly due to his forethought and quick responses. We would highly recommend any of his properties. We couldn’t have had a better experience considering why we had come! I have stayed at all the hotels near by for all our previous visits, I always left with major complaints for one reason or another- this time I had none. Never doing hotels in AR again thanks to this experience. Thanks Josh, we will be in touch again!!"

Stayed a few nights","“Cheerful “ is inaccurate. The living area is dark and not pleasantly furnished or inviting. The bathrooms were not clean. We foun whiskers around the fixtures of both bathroom vanity fixtures, and long black hair in the master bathtub. We found 2 wet towels hanging in the main bathroom. I spilled a small amount of water on the kitchen floor. I mopped it up with a paper towel, and the towel was black when I picked it up. The house was so cold that I needed a blanket to sit and watch tv. We were unable to adjust the temperature due to an over ride on the thermostat. We were there for a funeral, so, thankfully, did not ndid"

Be sure to check under the sink for extra pots and pans. Kevin also had the place fully stocked with soap, paper towels, and other products to make living there very easy. The TV is equipped w/ Vizio, which has the major streaming apps. It was easy to sign in and out when I left.
The apartment is centrally located in Fort Smith--quick access to various stores. It was also quite nice to have a garage attached to the place. Living here was very, very easy. Would recommend!"
