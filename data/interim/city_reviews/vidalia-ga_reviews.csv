Stayed a few nights","We spent a few days at the Riverview Cottage for our 32nd Anniversary and we absolutely loved it!! Entry was easy and it was so clean and decorated nicely. It was furnished with anything that you would need. We enjoyed just relaxing and taking it easy. The cottage was so cozy and I loved watching the hummingbirds. We took our boat but the river was too high to fish so we just enjoyed riding on the river. Our grandson stayed part of the weekend and he loved the playground. Troy and Leslie were quick to respond and we will definitely book from them again.

It’s super cozy, comfy, accommodating, perfectly located & well wired
All the things you want when you want to get away, but you don’t really don’t want to “get away”. 😂😂
Being a stone’s throw from the river, a beautiful playground, and one of the area’s best steakhouses, in Benton Lee’s, is just added benefits. .
The River Cottage is a 5 out of 5 for us ✅✅✅✅✅"

Stayed with kids","We had a last minute, two night booking and checked in around 9pm. The front door key pad wasn’t coded correctly, so I had to message the host to be told that the car port door was the one coded (even though the listing instructions said front door too). Not a huge deal, just a little inconvenient when my family is all tired and cranky.
The home is tastefully decorated and clean. The beds were comfortable and the kitchen had a basket of snacks, which is a nice touch.
The neighborhood is ok. I didn’t realize the house had another occupied dwelling right on the property, with a shared yard.
I was surprised to see that we were expected to do our own dishes (wash, dry, and put away), strip the beds and place the linens next to the washing machine, collect and place the bathroom towels on the bathroom floor, and remove the trash bag after paying a $125 cleaning fee."

The only negative about this home is the location. It is on a very busy side street with an ambulance that seems to cover the entire area. The traffic noise can be a little intrusive. Of course, I work night shift and sleep when it is busiest. Other than the noise, the location is convenient to everything in Vidalia. I will definitely stay here again because the home is well taken care of and the price is fair."

Stayed a few nights",Thanks Jae for hosting our crew. We really enjoyed our stay and the updates are a nice touch. Its refreshing finding a nice place in a small town where we don't have to sacrifice quality for cost. We travel often for work and will definitely stay again when in the area.

The house was easy to find and access, there was plenty of space for the kids to sleep and run around, and the house looked exactly like the photos. Clean and very comfortable! Jae was also responsive when we couldn’t initially get inside the house. Would love to stay again and hope it is available the next time we visit Vidalia!"

Group trip",Jae's place is a newly renovated older ranch home. Jae did a fantastic job with renovations and furnishing. The home looks professionally decorated. Everything in the home is new. The kitchen is stocked with enough dishes and pots and pans to cook your meals. The home does not have a dishwasher but everything is provided for handwashing. The beds are comfortable and the baths are furnished with lush towels and upscale bath products. The area is quiet except for some morning traffic. Jae follows up to make sure you have everything you need during you stay. I would highly recommended Jae's home for your future stay.

It can be a bit tricky finding the house but Mark gave us his cell number, answered right away and sent a google maps link that took us straight there (we were using Waze). I would not recommend trying to locate at night as it is a bit secluded.
Would highly recommend and will rent again in the future.

What a great porch to sit on and bbq with family. We were so lucky to find this airbnb in an area that you wouldn't expect to find many options. It's also close enough to day trip to Savannah and not pay the expensive Savannah lodging prices! If you're looking for a quiet peaceful setting to relax and recharge your soul, this is it!!!!"

Stayed a few nights","Mark’s place was even nicer than I expected. Everything was clean, comfy and cool. :)
Mark made sure it was stocked with everything you might need and more. :) He had pods in the laundry room, extra coffee pods in the kitchen, snacks and he even left us the makings for a spaghetti dinner.
I had asked Mark prior to arrival about fishing, and when we got there he had 2 brand new poles for us to use and even offered me use of his personal tackle box.
The property was exactly what I was looking for private, quiet and peaceful. A few times while my boyfriend and I were fishing at the pond, I stopped and whispered, “Listen to how quiet it is out here”. And, not a creepy quiet, a calm, peaceful quiet….Yes, there is a difference. 😉
Mark was my first ever Airbnb host, and I was a little nervous about the whole process with it being my first time and all and Mark couldn’t have made any easier for me. He responded quickly and NICELY. Check-in couldn’t have gone smoother or been easier."

She went above and beyond what I expected. She is definitely a kindred spirit. I showed the cute cottage off to my family in hopes that they will also book with Lydia on the future! It was just the space needed to wind down from a difficult day. Tysm!"

Stayed about a week","This place was wonderful! Very private, clean, and beautiful location. We rented kayaks and went down the river that's right in front of the cabin. The fire pit was perfect for an outdoor activity as well. As a few 20 year olds, we wanted to get away from the city and relax in nature. We felt very safe at this location, great prices for everything. Also, the neighbor who is next to the cabin helped us load up the kayaks and drove us down to a spot on the river in his humvee. His name is Storm, he showed us his goats and chickens they had as well! Very personable and friendly. This was the perfect week stay as a vacation, we hope to come back soon! The only downside we found was the road that leads to the cabin itself. If it rains, it gets pretty flooded. I would recommend a SUV or truck to get to the location. Or I'm sure the neighbor Storm I mentioned could help with that. You could use a car but would have to proceed with caution. Thank you again we hope to be back soon!"

Stayed with a pet","Beautiful and peaceful spot for relaxation and kayaking or canoeing right on the Ohoopee River. There is a great sandbar that you can stake out as your private beach, which our dog loved. The water is very clear and flowing - perfect for a float trip. The house is lovely and comfortable with room for a family group. The kitchen was fully stocked and there is an overflow refrigerator on back porch. If you need supplies, Lyons and Vidalia are about 10 to 14 miles away. There are some lovely independent restaurants there as well. I needed to work a bit while there, and was able to just set up on the back porch and overlook the river - not a bad office. There is WIFI - but I used my own. Also a TV for college football. I am so glad the cabin is dog friendly so I can take my travel companion with me. We would love to stay there again and take better advantage of the kayaking and canoeing opportunities. Thank you Mike"

Stayed a few nights","Looking for a nice, relaxing, and affordable get away? Look no further!! The cabin is SUPER nice and has plenty of space for you and your family. With a covered porch complete with a grill and skillet, you can cook up a good meal while enjoying the relaxing sounds of nature. We were fortunate to get some good weather, and some not so good weather. But the not so good weather was welcomed as the sounds of the thunderstorm and rain on the tin roof made for a PERFECT half day. For the first part of the day, we explored the Ohoopee River where we were able to catch some pretty decent sized bass! The part of the river directly in front of the cabin is really shallow, but if you walk down further, wading in the river, you can find some deeper water with fish! The fire pit was also a nice touch as we made s’mores each night we stayed! We drank our morning coffee on the dock overlooking the river and it was just perfect. Mike was super responsive (whenever we got cell service) and friendly. Once we connected to the Wi-Fi, there were no issues. The kitchen was fully stocked with all the appliances, dishes, bakeware, silverware, pots, and pans you might need. Bring your beach umbrella and chairs and sit by (or IN) the river and enjoy your dogs and/or kids playing in the shallow water. We will for sure be back!!"

Stayed with a pet","Ohoopee hideout is the perfect name for this place. You can’t help but feel like you’re part of a secret club out here buried in the wilderness right on the river. His neighbor Storm was great and saw me wondering around looking for a signal - he introduced himself, showed me around, and let me in. My 2 dogs absolutely loved being able to run around leash free all week, jumping in the river, chasing lizards and squirrels. The seclusion is 10/10 and Mike’s cabin is very nice to retreat to after a full day of hanging out on your own personal sandbar or waking the 3/4 mile trail down to Opal Island Sandbar. Comfy bed, nice furniture, and top grade appliances. Even though the catfish weren’t biting - the whole stay was exactly what I was looking for. Mike truly has a slice of paradise here and I for one am very grateful that he is willing to share it at such a decent rate. Coming back home to south Florida is like culture shock after hearing nothing but birds, owls, and the sound of running water - I already want to go back! Thanks again Mike"

I stayed for eleven days and was more than ready to call it home, especially after my 13+ hour drive from up north. The cleanliness is emaculate. I had no yucky feelings that I needed to wipe anything down before settling in. This place is clean to the point where you're comfortable about cleaning up behind yourself without the feeling that you're cleaning up after a previous guest or a lazy housekeeper. I am definitely adding this to my ""Repeat Stay"" airbnb list!"

Group trip","Our family was in the area for a reunion the first weekend in November and wanted a house that had multiple bedrooms/bathrooms so some of us could stay together instead of booking separate hotel rooms.
The location was close to the reunion location and had 4 bedrooms and a full kitchen which allowed us to make breakfast together and prep food to take to the reunion. Having only a bath and a half was a concession for us, but we managed. The half bath is incredibly small and is located in one of the bedrooms off the hall, but we were thankful to have it with a full house of people. We are a close family so it worked out okay to share it.
We all thought the ""bee"" theme was so cute! They've done a nice job decorating and making this older house feel homey. Everything was clean. 🙂Although we saw that some of the dishes still had tags on them, and we didn't really want to take time to wash them before using. There is not a dishwasher. Dish soap, sponges and towels were provided.
Unfortunately, the AC wasn't working for us during our stay. The weather was warm and humid and the temperature in the house got up to 80 degrees overnight. Communication with the owner was excellent! She was very responsive and had her husband go and take a look on Saturday. It was most likely low on Freon and they weren't able to get a repair company out to fix it until Monday, after we left. She was very apologetic and gave us a 10% refund for our inconvenience.
The beds were comfortable and having ceiling fans helped with the AC issue. The 3 bedrooms off the hall are very small, with not much extra space, but the closets could be used for luggage.
The kitchen was in good working order with a full size fridge/freezer, stove, microwave, toaster, as well as a Keurig and drip coffee maker. She provided coffee filters, some coffee and little creamers, which was very nice. It would have have been helpful to have some measuring spoons and cups, a couple of mixing bowls and a non-stick pan. After my suggestion she said she would add them.
There are steps inside the house to access the bedroom off the kitchen (probably used to be a carport/garage). This was important to us as we had a special needs child in a wheelchair. We managed, but that room was the best room for him, because he had to sleep on the floor (since he didn't have a bed with rails like at home) and it was the only bedroom with enough floor space. He's an 80 pound 5 year old, which is a lot to lift! 😊 There is an exterior door in that room, which was nice to be able to roll his wheelchair in, without having to go up and down the front steps.
The guys had fun watching football on the big tv!
There were a few things we noticed that might be an issue - in the bedroom with the half bath there is a wire sticking out of the wall outlet and a cable poking up out of the floor.
The caulking around the tub/shower doesn't seem to be sufficient and the shower head is very low. That's fine for us short people, but was a little challenging for the tall ones. But, we really appreciated having plenty of hot water for showers and washing dishes.
Despite a few issues, we enjoyed our time in Vidalia in this cute house and were so thankful to be able to stay together. We wish you all the best!"

Group trip","Mel was very responsive, checked on us by text during the rental, and was easy to work with. The instructions for the stay were clear, and the check out procedure was simple, logical and also clear.
The property is easy to find, and convenient to everything. There was plenty of perfectly acceptable parking off the street. When we arrived, the house was sparkling clean, no dust, no dirt, and a faint smell of bleach, which I personally like, but those of you with sensitivities should contact the host.
My group of 5 changed to 3 then expanded to 6 after we arrived, and the host accommodated the changes without any problems. We were very comfortable in the amount of space the home offers, and I was especially glad I could offer the space to the family--their reservations got messed up...and mine didn't.
The living room space is so wonderful that families and friends will want to gather. The furniture is modern and clean and the decorations not overbearing so that you can still use the coffee table and the end tables as tables, with some holiday appropriate touches, which was nice. The climate control worked well, and everybody stayed very comfortable with the temperature in the house.
Every bedroom has a TV, everybody was happy. The rooms are generously sized, each with a window. The beds were comfortable and the white sheets and blankets clean. The beds have fluffy clean white comforters.
A single bath made us anxious on occasion, and the kitchen cookware would not support cooking for 6, but there is a generous list in the welcome book of choices for take out and eating out just beyond the driveway. The amenities for bathroom and coffee service were lush. There is a Keurig and a nice selection of coffee, tea and hot chocolate. The bathroom reminded me of a hotel, with some items offered in case you forgot or in case you flew in and couldn't bring everything with you. There is a shower dispenser with your basics, some tooth brushes and tooth paste, and plenty of fresh white towels and wash cloths. Again, very clean.
Thanks again, Mel. We appreciate your obvious extra efforts during COVID and give you 5 stars. We would definitely choose your home for a repeat stay."

The area had a water issue earlier in the day before we arrived. Mel informed me of the issue and provided bottled water for us incase the tap water still had issues.
We arrived later than intended so it was dark by the time we arrived in Lyons. We kept missing the house so I messaged Mel asking for landmarks, she responded very quickly and we found the house. It was one of those times when you're over tired and can't find the glasses on your face."

Our visit was to spend time with family we don't get to see often. This house was perfect for young cousins to enjoy a sleepover with the grandparents. It was like walking back in time to summers at my own grandma's house. The stoop was my favorite spot to hang out.
Our grandkids loved being able to play in their own space, yet still be right next to us.
The local park/ playground is fantastic! Lots of different activities and great playground.
We also enjoyed the short walk for brick oven pizza and authentic ice cream shop for dessert. Popsicles on the stoop made the stay even more special
The beds were so comfortable, I slept all night for the first time in years!
Yes, there is traffic noise but it's faint and didn't bother us a bit.
Overall, this place is clean, well decorated, and the little extras add that special something.
We will definitely be back."

Stayed a few nights","This house is old but has been remodeled nicely, with cute vintage touches. Check-in is easy and there are security cameras around the house. The bed I slept in was very comfortable, and there were Roku tvs throughout the house which I liked. There is a lot of road traffic being right off 280, so know that before you rent. The house was clean, but there is an issue with some pests that hopefully will be taken care of for future renters."

Stayed one night","This is a cute vintage house located off Hwy 280 in Lyons. It has been ""modernized "" with Roku tvs, Wifi, central heating and air, etc. The house has three bedrooms and one bath. The bed I slept in was very comfortable with super soft white sheets. Overall the house was very clean and well-kept. I could hear road traffic at night, but that was mentioned in the listing. It's obviously hard to avoid given the house's location. I felt fairly safe during my stay. I would definitely recommend the house and look forward to staying again in the future!"

First, the cabin itself is beautiful— even better in person Than the pictures reflect. The rooms were spacious, clean, and the serenity of the place alongside the view of nature from every angle made this just the place for my family and I to unplug from the city. Our hosts were so lovely: kind, open-hearted, and warm and just the kind of welcome my family needed for a first visit. We’ll definitely be coming again. I def recommend for anyone looking to relax on their way to Savannah or Atlanta."

We had made weekend plans to visit our daughter at GSU and wanted to have our own space. and enough space in case she wanted to stay a night or two with us and not sleep in her dorm. The property is easy to get to and somewhat remote, but the it is very peaceful and quiet at the home. The view from the living room/kitchen is awesome and you can see most of the fenced-in property from this location....plenty of sunlight shines in to the area. We were very comfortable staying here and found the home to be very organized and clean. We'd definitely consider staying here again when we are back in town for a visit to our daughter."

I hope we can stay here again soon. Thank you.

The room was clean and the bed was super comfortable. Nice touches like coffee, a nice space heater (it has central heat, but some times a space heater to knock the chill off is nice) tons of towels, and even a burger off the grill was nice. It has all the amenities needed. Thanks for everything. I’d definitely recommend staying here and when I come back I hope the unit is still available.
My only sort of negative comment I have would be to make sure and bring a computer or tablet. There isn’t a TV. For me I travel with an iPad Pro so it didn’t matter."

The suite is located on the back of the house which is where you park so you need to use a different address to find it but Josh gave us great directions and we were able to locate is quite easily and get checked in. Josh was a gracious host upon our arrival and we had a chance to sit and have a visit and get to know him. He was very helpful giving us directions around the city and offering suggestions for restaurants and shopping excursions. We were visiting from Canada so it was nice to have a chance to talk to Josh and ask questions about the area and learn a little bit about Vidalia and Georgia.
Josh was quick to respond to any questions we had via message or text. We had no issues with the suite, it is a clean, comfortable place to stay and we plan on staying again in the future. Thanks for the hospitality Josh!!"

Stayed with a pet","Loved it! If you are looking for peace and quiet, privacy and or boating this place is perfect. If thats what you are looking for you will not regret staying at Jills place. Loved sitting on the covered back porch having lunch and cofee looking at the water with the ceiling fans going kept it cool and any bugs away. Everything you need for cooking a meal is available. Jill is extremely responsive. All furniture was comfortable. Place smelled fresh and clean when we got there. Nicely decorated.Also 2 things I really appreciated was that there was a tv in the bedroom and there were plenty of washcloths and towels. Now just a heads up be careful by the edge of the waterbank, mud is slippery."

Stayed with kids","I'm just gonna be honest about this place. The manufactured home is on a beautiful piece of property with a river right in the backyard. Very peaceful and private. Inside the house the beds are comfortable, bathrooms are acceptable, the house is equipped pretty much with everything you need. But if you want a clean place this is not for you."

Stayed a few nights","We’ve stayed with Jill twice now. We enjoyed the campfire, the front deck, the peaceful privacy, and the nice soak tub.
The bridge over to the island is very serene. This would be a great place for people who love to go fishing or just be on the river. We travel for work.
Jill’s furniture is beautiful. She has decorated very nicely. The kitchen is very well equipped.
Most of all, Jill is one of the kindest hosts we’ve encountered in over a decade of traveling. She is very responsive and accommodating!"

We had all of the essentials we needed. We did bring a full size coffee pot because we needed it. Jill has a keurig.
The porch was great! We enjoyed the fire pit, the smoker, and the charcoal grill!"

Stayed with a pet",Loved this place! We had an amazing stay! Everything was clean and tidy! She had everything that you would possibly need for your stay and more! Loved the bridge that went down to the water and all the little extras! It felt wonderful to bring our fur baby with us! This was his first holiday and he loved walking on the paved driveway and down to the water and back! We will definitely be back!

Stayed with a pet","Owner is very responsiveness and nice. We were here for a few days having evacuated from Florida for the hurricane. She was very nice during a difficult time. The property is beautiful and peaceful. This is a VERY remote location so if that’s what you’re looking for, this is for you! WiFi is a bit spotty, as is cell service. If you book here, do not click on the “Directions” link in the Airbnb app. It took us to the wrong address. You’ll want to type in the address in the listing. If you do that, you’ll have no problem. The sunsets on the river were really something to see. Location is pet friendly which was great."

Stayed a few nights","Talk about a hidden gem! I would like to kept this little secret hidden for myself! The home was more than expected. Very clean and comfy! But let's talk outdoor living.... sitting on the fully stocked back porch grilling & chilling, enjoying a fire by the river, wetting a hook while your feet are in the creek water or playing family games in the green grass between the house & water... you’ll enjoy each & every moment. Believe me when I say the pictures just don't do the beauty of the property justice. We have definitely found our little hidden gem in Uvalda."

We especially loved grilling on the back porch and watching the river. House was stocked with all essentials plus more! We will definitely be back!

I sincerely could not have booked a 5 star resort that even came close to this home!!! If you are in this area you must rent it this home. I look forward to my next business trip to Savannah! I would stay here an hour away from Savannah than Savannah’s highest rated hotel! Do not miss this incredible opportunity to stay in such a well appointed home!!! Definitely classy beyond your expectations!!! A 5 star rating!!!!"

We had a 6 year old and an 11 month old and it was great having a crib and high chair!
Madeleine was reachable the entire time and asked throughout our stay if there was anything we needed. It was great to have someone checking in on us.
We will definitely stay again when visiting the area!"
