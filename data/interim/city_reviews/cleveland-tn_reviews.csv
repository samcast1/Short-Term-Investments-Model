Stayed one night","The loft is so cute! The decor is a mix and match of colors and patterns that just work together. It is a big open space that feels cozy and modern at the same time. The king bed was comfortable and we had no issues with ac/ heat either. Plenty of towels were provided. We were very satisfied!
Getting to the parking lot was a little confusing; however, it was mostly because of the major construction and road block/ road closed signs. Hannah gave us the heads up though on check in day. Thank you!
We were traveling for a friend’s wedding at Howe Farm. I will say, that drive is further than I expected, especially if the event is in the 5 Gables venue.
There are a lot of local coffee shops, restaurants and charming looking shops in walking distance to the loft. Most of which are closed on Sundays, but it was still an amusing little downtown. I would definitely revisit!"

Stayed a few nights","I had a great time at Hannah's Loft. Its convenient location near coffee shops and restaurants made it an ideal choice for evenings during my work trip. The space itself was roomy, and the AC/heater worked surprisingly well considering the size of the place. Although there was some noise from passing trains at night, I would rate it a 4/10 in terms of sound level, but it didn't bother me much, especially with the fan running."

Stayed a few nights","Loved Hannah’s Loft in Cleveland, TN. We were within walking distance to several restaurants and coffee shops. Lasaters was fantastic for coffee and Indigo for dinner. So many other options like Ocoee Coffee and Roma. Pickleball was at the Rec Center (raining) and Tinsley Park for outdoor play. Friendly people and we felt right at home in this quaint city. Black Fox Farm was a wonderful venue for our friends’ wedding. Overall, great stay at Hannah’s Loft and big thumbs up for Cleveland, TN!!"

We got married at ocoee crest and wanted to be closer to the airport for our honeymoon and everything was perfect! Hannah is super responsive and gives recommendations when needed. The loft is located right above the Beauty Room Spalon, which happened to be our Hair and Makeup artists for the wedding! We will definitely come back for a staycation, even just to stay in this beautiful loft again which is gorgeously furnished and clean!"

Stayed a few nights",Beautiful airbnb. It was clean and beautifully decorated. The sunrise from the kitchen window was stunning! This Airbnb is in a great location. It's also very close to Lee University. The only issue we had with the loft was the parking. There is a designated parking space right next to the entrance to the Airbnb. At times customers of surrounding businesses utilized that parking space even though it’s clearly designated for the Airbnb resident. That was a little frustrating when the parking lot was full.

It was very easy to get in with the keypad, and parking is right outside the door. The loft space is huge! Plenty of room. Kitchen is well appointed although we didn't cook while staying here. Just a note for those considering this space, it is on the second floor with a full flight of stairs. Not an issue for us, but my parents could not have made it up. Our event was next door at the museum, so the very short walk was ideal. Highly recommend this space!!"

Stayed a few nights","This loft was probably one of my favorite airbnbs I’ve *ever* stayed in. The parking spot was VIP, the space cozy, eccentric, clean, and open. My favorite part was having coffee in the kitchen drenched in the abundant morning light. I was in town for a wedding and doing my make up in the large mirror with tons of natural light was perfect. I can tell the airbnb host takes wonderful care of her space by how happy and healthy her houseplants were. I don’t know if I’ll find myself in Cleveland, TN again, but I might need to make the trip back just to stay here one more time!"

It's basically a ""studio"" but in fact it is HUGE. Hannah has decorated the place with so much eye candy I found myself kicking back and just enjoing the show. Location is great - please do yourself a favor and walk a couple of blocks to Cafe Roma - but that's a whole other review (fabulous)... you just have to experience it... trust me... and am VERY picky"

Stayed a few nights","The photos and reviews are accurate: this is the most beautiful Airbnb EVER, has everything you need (except maybe cream/sugar for the espresso), and is super convenient to downtown Cleveland and Lee University. We were a little worried about the area of town but had no issues and almost no street noise. I was proud to have a couple of friends over for a take-out dinner in this stunning loft. I could totally live here! There were some burned-out lightbulbs and a few imperfections to be expected in a historic home. The only major thing renters should be aware of is that this is not exclusively an Airbnb property; that means that most of the drawers and cabinets and some of the fridge shelves are full of the owner’s belongings, and other than the list of amenities, there’s no clearly defined spaces for what’s for renters vs what’s just for the owner. Like, are spices and napkins and laundry detergent for sharing or no? My husband probably would have helped himself to the bar cart if I didn’t tell him that only the glassware was listed under amenities. It was a bit awkward to be in someone’s personal space, so I’d just want others to be aware in case they’re more accustomed to a couple of locked closets/cabinets. This does limit storage also, so I personally wouldn’t stay for more than a few nights since I’d have to live out of a suitcase, more or less. Even with this, I still give this place a five-star rating because it is truly a beautiful getaway for two people and close to everything. I’d definitely stay again if the price point remains the same."

Hannah has got a style and you’ll love the decor and comfort of her loft! It has a New Orleans/French inspired vibe. It’s spacious yet cozy with thoughtful vignettes seating areas. Very unique & very beautiful! The cleanliness is impeccable as even her hard wood floors are squeaky clean!!
Hannah is a generous hostess for even supplying her guests with details like mini shampoo/conditioner body wash and TP. She has books and board games if you just want to relax.
We recommend if your visiting Cleveland, do yourself a favor and book Hannah’s loft- you’ll be in for a special treat!"

We stayed in Cleveland as a midpoint to our rafting trip down the Ocoee. It was 14 minutes to Cherokee Rafting which helped us be right on time for our adventure!
Her local guidebook is wonderful as well - try True at BHB! Excellent James Beard nominated chef-driven menu.
12/10 highly recommend Hannah’s loft!"

This space is exceptional clean.Hannah takes great pride of her loft. When I went to fall asleep, the sheets were crisp and clean and smelled so good.
Hannah also is very quick to respond. Communication was easy and convenient. I will stay here again if I am ever back this way for a wedding."

Gorgeous art, huge windows, charming wainscoting, luxe touches everywhere you look. Everything about our stay was divine. Hannah thought of all the creature comforts—feather pillows, extra soft linens, a Nespresso machine, and even a bottle of Prosecco. We appreciated the provided toiletries as well. Her communication was excellent and check in/check out was a breeze. I’m a local and used the space as a bridal suite for my wedding weekend, but she sent over several great recommendations of things to do and places to eat. I’m beyond pleased with my experience, and I’m tickled to have discovered this gem so close to home. We’ll be back!"

We have a large family and filled up the house, but there were plenty of towels, pillows, and blankets. He had soaps and little bottles of shampoo etc in the bathrooms and dishwasher and laundry detergent provided.
The property is very nice and well-kept. One of my sons caught some fish from the picturesque lake. It was wonderful to have a house big enough for the whole family and not have to get multiple hotel rooms. The grandchildren had so much fun being all together that they didn't want to leave and are asking about going back again!

We made use of the kitchen, which was perfect for cooking a big meal, and we enjoyed the deck and pond views. Deer Park, just down the road in Cleveland, was an excellent playground for the kids. Leif responded quickly to all our messages, and he was available onsite to help with any problems throughout our stay."

Leif was a great host and the house was great for the 3 of us plenty of room for us to chill watch TV or hang out on the deck in the evening after a day on the lake. Super quiet neighborhood and had no worries about having our boats and equipment outside. Real close to town and plenty of places to eat or buy anything you may need. Leif was a great host an very attentive making sure we had everything for a great stay. We also did a little fishing in the lake out back. All in all the next time we are in town that's where will be staying.

Stayed with kids","What brought us to Leif's place was the incredible value. We visit our grandson and this time of year the weather can be rainy so we just need a place that is clean and where we can spread out. There are 6 of us. This was a perfect spot to do this and more. The backdrop of the private lake was wonderful even if it was rainy. We were a bit nervous because we were sharing the house with Leif, the owner, but not to worry. Leif, being a native of Cleveland, TN was very helpful, could show us how to turn on the fireplace and give us directions/suggestions of good restaurants and things to do. However, he was very busy and left the home most of the time. He was very good at letting you have the space to yourself. The beds were so comfortable, bathrooms were very nice; the master bath had a wonderful jetted tub and was so large. It was great. Overall, the BEST experience that we have had to date at an airbnb. We will be staying with Leif again."

Even though the home shares a wall with another townhome, it was very quiet. Lastly, the location of the home is great. It is in a nice neighborhood and convenient to everything. If you're looking for a peaceful, stylish, and conveniently located place to stay, I wholeheartedly recommend booking with Angel. Thank you for a wonderful stay - I can't wait to return!"

We have stayed at various Airbnb’s before, and Lacey is one of the best representatives that we’ve ever worked with. She always responded to us with answers to any questions we may have. One thing I can say about this particular home, is it is very close to Lee University, almost within walking distance, and is a great location for any families coming into town for their kids events over at the university. If you get a chance to stay at one of her locations, you will not be disappointed. And one of the biggest offerings that she has, is her locations are pet friendly. With fenced and backyards and everything. The dogs absolutely loved it. Thanks Lacey again for a wonderful stay. Jeff and Avalon."

Laura was a superb host, quick to reach out to me, eager to be of help with any questions before and after arrival, so gracious and kind. Upon our arrival we had no problem getting into the home. Our family traveled from Missouri to Tennessee for a weekend wedding. It was so good to have such a clean, well equipped home to relax in. Laura's home was just as described. Our party of 8 adults were on a specific schedule with one goal in mind. We had lots to do in a short time. Laura's home was so well put together, everything was clean. The layout of the home works so well. Nice clean, quiet neighborhood, easy to find. It was so serene and peaceful we really hated to leave. From the time we arrived until we left, we felt right at home. When we return to Cleveland, I will be getting another reservation for this home ."

Wonderful place to stay for long or short stay needs. Thanks again."

Stayed a few nights",The area is perfect and the neighbors are really nice. The condition of the home upon arrival was not good and we took pictures…I considered reaching out to the owner but decided just to make the best of it. There were food crumbs on the living room end table and kitchen counters. Dried food on the fridge and handle…the dust throughout was thick and noticeable. No hand soap and the toilet paper roll was practically empty. There were instructions to remove garbage but we were greeted with a half full kitchen garbage can. The dining area table was smeared with a greasy film. My daughter and I had to wiped everything down and purchase hand soap and toilet paper. I will add on the last day we discovered a closet of supplies but nothing had been put out for us. The decor is interesting but it needs a good cleaning. The guy who cuts the grass came while we were there and that flared up my allergies…arrangements to cut grass should be made in between guest stays.

Dan & Nancy were attentive hosts with prompt responses and ensured we had all we needed to make our trip the most memorable we could have ever imagined. Cleveland, TN is a hidden gem and Dan & Nancy’s home is the perfect spot to make it your home away from home."

We asked for an early check in so my dad could go straight there and lie down after surgery. I was able to cook for him and he could just lie in bed and watch tv. It was perfect and so much better than a hotel. Oh and Publix and everything you need is not far away. Great location and excellent value. Highly recommend!!

Stayed one night","A great place. Part of the charm is Dan & Nancy. These nice folks opened their home and shared their tea with me, to help me out with my cough. The home is spacious and while they were there, it did not feel awkward. I LOVED the personal touches in the room, which were not immediately evident as meaningful, but there as tasteful decor. The comforter was great and I loved being able to listen to the sprinkle of rain, outside the big window. Very comfortable bed and internet access was easy. The neighborhood is very safe, and access to your vehicle is convenient. Dan & Nancy gave me some great local advise which proved itself. Some things close by which I appreciated: Walgreens, Ross, Starbucks, Buffalo Wild Wings! There is a little more here than expected, at this highway stop. I recommend this for any traveler."

My room was squeaky clean & the bed was very comfortable, giving me a wonderful restful night, before driving a Motorcoach full of 8th graders to Washington D. C.
If you are looking for a great place to stay in Cleveland, I highly encourage you stay at Dan & Nancy's place!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a beautiful home but we were very disappointed in the cleanliness of the house. I really don’t think it was cleaned prior to check in. There was hair everywhere! In the sinks, tubs, in refrigerator, and even all over the sheets. There was coffee that was spilled all over the counter near the machine that wasn’t cleaned up. I thought that the cleaning people might come back to help but they didn’t offer. The hosts had a family issue which was understandable but they never offered to check in or offer anything. I was here on a work trip and me and my employees had to scrubs toilets, bathrooms, clean the refrigerator, and wash our sheets just so we could stay. The home is beautiful and the area is nice, but I was very disappointed."

Stayed a few nights","This was the perfect location for exploring Cleveland and Chattanooga. Nearby parks for accessible hiking & 18 hole frisbee golf. So many restaurants nearby & groceries for eating in. We even visited the Cleveland library for some quiet moments.
It's worth the 25 minute drive down 75 to Chattanooga to see Rock City & Pointe Park. Our favorite stops downtown Chattanooga were at the National Medal of Honor Heritage Center & Sticky Fingers Rib House. Shaun's house made it all easy to get to.
This was one of the cleanest vacation rentals we've stayed in! Loved the subtle yet whimsical birds and flowers in the decor! Finding all of the birds would be a great treasure hunt for kids. The upstairs ""loft"" area is great for separation while still feeling connected.
The king bed had a soft mattress, but the two queen beds were firm. It's nice to find a firm option on vacation.
Shaun made us feel at home. Great communication and availability."

Stayed a few nights","Accurately described. Communication from both hosts could have been better, as I informed the host that my colleague, a registered guest would be arriving prior to my arrival. When she arrived, the check in instructions were unclear prompting an access code. She called the host and it was apparent that the information had not been communicated to both hosts regarding the different arrival times, as he was questioning who she was and stated that he only gives the codes to the primary booking guest. This was not communicated to me after I had informed the hosts of of our separate arrival times. It was after dark and my colleague mentioned that she felt a bit wary of the neighborhood in addition to not being able to enter for quite some time. I communicated this information to the host and he responded promptly and apologized. Be aware that there is a strict 10am checkout time with increasing minute by minute fees, which is quite early compared to most hosts."

We stayed 7days/8 nights & we’re on the go from the time we woke up to the time we returned & not having to make a run to get something was very appreciative. Don’t think the kitchen was missing anything! Everything you could have needed was there! The coffee/tea station she has set up has so many options! Had 1 issue but she was on it pronto! Beds were comfortable & thankfully she had a fan available for white noise & a hot sleeper! For what little free time we did have she had games, coloring books, magazines & 2 streaming TV’s available for our downtime. The neighborhood was actually quieter than I thought it would be. The grandchildren loved watching the birds & squirrels in the backyard as they devoured the food in the bird feeder. 1 squirrel would get it’s food and scurry to the top, & sit & watching us!"

Great communication with Heidie, easy to come and go with the keypad, well-stocked kitchen, beautifully decorated; the colors were so calming. But do let Heidie know ahead of time if you don’t want a plug-in fragrance in the house, and she’ll graciously remove it. (She did for us – I’d checked about fragrances because of a fragrance allergy in our group – but the smell was still too strong for all of us when we arrived; we had to open the windows.) Overall, a renewing, wonderful place!"

The home is a three bedroom/ 1 bath.

The stay couldn’t have been better, the house was so clean and cozy and within walking distance of the greenway walking path and that was cool!

This is the location. We were even able to spend a day in Atlanta from this location. We were so glad we chose Cleveland and this home-it was quiet, so comfortable, lovely amenities and touches from the host. Cookies when we arrived and breakfast the next morning after a long drive-were a God send. Almost chose Gatlinburg but our day-trip proved it would not have been a quiet place----so many people and so crowded. Cleveland and Heidie's home were a perfect ""basecamp"" for our daily jaunts."

To say that they went above and beyond would be an understatement!! Between the ambient lighting, the roses on the bed, the bottle of wine, and the charcuterie tray, it was the perfect touch to our wedding day. My wife actually cried when we walked in. The bed was super comfortable, and the bungalow was stocked with everything you could think of - there's a coffee bar, scents for a difusor, snacks, and a charging station, just to name a few. They also have storage bags, condiments, extra toiletries, and robes that you can use while you're there. A lot of Air bnbs are somewhat stocked, but ive never stayed anywhere that was so thoughtful in providing everything you could possibly need. To top it off, theres a therapeutic pool and hot tub! They were extremely kind to work with and very responsive. We will definitely be back and highly recommend"

My wife and I honestly consider it our getaway staycation spot, as it is right outside of Chattanooga. This was our 2nd visit to the “Kickback Bungalow” and it was even better than the first. The personal touch Beth added this time, as my wife and I were celebrating our 8th year anniversary, was very special. We were greeted with roses, flowers, key lime pie and even a special message on her chalkboard. We loved the pool and hot tub, and definitely we will be back. She even provided safety glasses for us to watch the eclipse on her nice patio. Ever since our first visit, about 2 years ago, we have told many of our friends to visit. I think we will be continuing to tell even more people about Beth’s place"

Stayed with a pet","I must go on & on about Kick Back Bungalow. It is such a unique & amazing place. Very clean, well furnished & equipped & so darn beachy & cute. The pool/spa room is incredible! Imagine a boutique hotel room with your very own small private pool; hot tub, fireplace, swinging chair & more. It is so nice & relaxing after a long car ride to unwind in this private oasis. There are so many extras, gosh too many to mention them all. We especially appreciated the cold waters + juices upon arrival, wide assortment of fresh fruit + lil bagged snacks plus a Keurig coffee bar. However, the amazing white chocolate snickerdoodle type cookies decorated with chocolate seashells were out of this world! Elizabeth & Karl have done an awesome job setting this property up; it is so well organized. We travel frequently with our pup & never have we seen a vacation property that just well.....has it all! Do not hesitate to book the Bungalow; you will not regret it nor be disappointed."

My son is obsessed with the pool, and it's so nice to have that as an activity for both of us to do after we return from a day of adventuring. The bed is big enough for both of us to sleep in, and the kitchen and dining area are sufficient for our needs for a few days at a time. My son has already asked if we can return this summer!"

When we got there we were surprised with a bouquet of flowers, ""happy birthday"" balloon, pastries, and all kinds of extra treats. The hot tub and swim spa were amazing! We had everything we could need. While there are plenty of restaurants and shops to explore just a short drive away, once we were there we didn't want to leave the bungalow. I can't wait to go back soon."

Stayed with a pet","1st time writing about a property b/c Kick Back Bungalow & Elizabeth deserve it. We were welcomed by the subtle sound of Jimmy Buffet as we entered Kick Back. The space was exactly like photos & actually felt bigger especially in the indoor space. The bathroom is very compact but accurately represented in photos. I was so impressed w/personal touches added to this property-handwritten note, fruit/goodie basket, juices, coffees/teas/""fixins"", meds in the cabinet, paper products a plenty, etc-difference between someone caring for their own property vs. having it managed from afar by a company was so recognizable. We were going to bring our dog but didn't & upon advising Elizabeth, she initiated a pet-fee refund proactively. The little touches from beachy tic tac toe, whimsy cabinet pulls, window picture to simulate being beachside, fairy lights, greenery all made for a great stay. I have major back issues & the therapeutic pool/hot tub were beyond words beneficial. Will be back!"

And we really, really, really want to go back. 
We want to go back to the 19 foot spa/lap pool, and the Bluetooth speakers, and the thoughtful snacks, and the incredibly comfortable bed, and the 327 personal little touches that were everywhere you looked. The owners clearly spent a lot of time trying to think of anything and everything they could do to make you feel at home! 
The only negative thing I could say is that I’m disappointed in myself for not buying one of the robes.

There's a cute little side porch great for hanging out in the evenings. We saw rabbits, a raccoon and lots of colorful birds. Great little breeze there.

Stayed a few nights","Kick-back bungalow was exactly as advertised and quite wonderful. It is a quiet and private situation, which was what my wife I were looking for after a hectic and difficult few months. We had a great time and unwound with long sessions in the indoor pool and hot tub, watching some streaming shows and sleeping on a very comfortable bed! There was nothing lacking and nothing that disappointed. The only criticism, and it was very minor, was the bathroom and shower are pretty small. It is very well appointed with lots of lotions and such, however. The kitchen has just about everything you might need to cook a very fine meal. If we lived close, we’d be at Kick-back bungalow several times a year! Thank you, Elizabeth, for sharing your private retreat!"

The swim spa/hot tub was the most fabulous part of it all, after a day out exploring the Cleveland/Chattanooga/Georgia area..it was a welcome relaxation upon return. A cold drink in the evening or sliding in in the morning with a cup of coffee... fabulous. There were actually a couple days we decided to just stay in. We actually met beth and Karl a day or so before our stay ended, and they are wonderful, kind people. It was a pleasure staying in their little slice of paradise. The only thing I think I could critique is that being one, we almost always cook our own food , and two being there for an entire week...the refrigerator is quite small...overall.. fabulous!"

From the moment you walk in, you forget you’re in southeastern Tennessee and instead feel like you’re on the beach. Elizabeth and Karl have taken every detail into account from the decor and linens to the aromatherapy and music. They give great recommendations and are the best hosts ever! There is truly everything you need at the bungalow to kick back, relax, and recharge. We can’t wait for our next visit!!"

Every possible amenity was provided to make us comfortable, including gorgeous flowers on the coffee table. And so many snacks! (If you’re coming from out of town for leisure purposes, I highly recommend McKay’s for cheap books, board games, cd’s for the stereo, etc.) Very glad we chose Beth’s place for our getaway."

Stayed a few nights","We reserved this place for much needed rest and relaxation. Beth’s place definitely came through. The home was beautifully decorated, easy to navigate and the spa room was AMAZING! Loved the lighting elements and the snacks. The gas fireplace and cocoon swing were a wonderful place to curl up and do some reading. Home was clean and very welcoming. The guidebook covers most any question you might have as to where things are and how they work. The only thing that came up was that the listing mentioned Disney+ as an amenity but you have to have your own subscription whereas with regard to Netflix, we had access to the host’s subscription. Beth apologized for that inconvenience and was overall super accommodating. She checked on us as we were departing to ask how our stay was. She definitely gives the impression that she wants her guests to enjoy their experience. Highly recommend!"

I couldn’t believe how magical it was. There are more than enough amenities, and there are so many little details that made this place a work of art. The pool / hot tub by the fireplace was my favorite! We both also loved the modern appliances in the bathroom. Elisabeth even had a personal message, a card, and candles on for us — with other little romantic gestures we requested! My fiancé and I had some questions for her, and she responded back IMMEDIATELY each time! It was a couple of nights to remember!

From relaxing in the pool or hot tub to enjoying the tasty treats Beth thoughtfully put out everywhere, we feel immensely refreshed and ready to face life’s challenges again. Definitely will be coming back when we need some R&R. Also Beth went above and beyond to meet our needs. We had been traveling for a few days already and really needed to wash laundry.

It is like Elisabeth goes through every foot of this home and makes each step special! From the moment you walk in, it is gorgeous! So clean, so relaxing! Easy check in and out. Great communication. Such special goodies after a long drive. Wonderful snacks. The shower is new and I was singing in it! The rain and wand on it relaxes your body but nothing compares to the jacuzzi and swim spa with fireplace and swing that you will find in the back room! After those enjoyable hours then onto a nice cup of tea (She has dif teas and coffees with all the needed creams and sugars) and popcorn to relax the evening after that heaven on earth Jimmy Buffet experience! The softest sheets imaginable and pillows~ ohhh and awwww. Wake up and have some of the best coffee and freshest fruit or cereal or the many other goodies left to only go in the spa area again and the shower because there is never enough time here to enjoy and let the worries of the world just leave your mind! I highly recommend, you won't be sorry! Perfectly clean and cozy! Heaven on earth oasis with the softest sheets, blankets, bedding, and towels. Everything you could think of is there, even a flashlight to take your dog out, now that is thoughtful! Thank you Elisabeth and family!"

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I are avid hikers. Cleveland is central to a ton of great hikes and waterfalls in Tennessee, Georgia and N.C. Also caverns and natural attractions. The Bungalow is awesome. Immaculate and well appointed. Elizabeth goes out of her way to make sure that one's need are met promptly. Snacks, Coffee are plentiful. Elizabeth was curious to find out in the evening to find out how are day went. I'm sure to let you guys know. She only responded to me, never did she initiate. She's definitely not the type to intrude. We kinda wish she had. We could hang with her for sure. Karl is the busy invisible man. Everything about our stay and place is positive. We were there 6 days and really didn't spend any of our daylight time there. We hike. Rigorously. The pool and hot tub allowed us to push ourselves as we knew the spa would ease our soreness, and they did. Everything works and is well supplied. Water pressure great. Soaps, towels. plates, silver, better than home. The reviewers aren't lying. Too much for the money in my view. We loved it. Kevin and Jovee"

Stayed with a pet","We were pleasantly surprised by how well decorated and appointed the bungalow was! It seemed no detail was left undone! From the snacks and choices of coffee to the hair scrunches, lotions, towels, lighting and music in the pool room, everything led to a beautiful and relaxing atmosphere! We’ve not experienced that attention to detail anywhere else we’ve stayed! The only thing I can think of that could be improved was that the mattress was a bit soft! But, with everything else, I hate to even mention that! No doubt, these are a Super Hosts!! Highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights",Beautiful and very relaxing stay. Me and my boyfriend stayed and it was the perfect place. We were only 25/30 minutes away from ruby falls and the aquarium that we went to. 10/10 recommend getting the romance/celebrate package. She had left us the best cheesecake and most beautiful Bouquet as well as other things. Our host was very nice and easy to get ahold of. The place also had everything you could need. Very thought out and honestly the best Airbnb I’ve stayed in.

Stayed a few nights","The hosts were amazing, there was so much privacy and the bed was super comfortable. The sink in kitchen is a little small, but we worked around it for the beautiful stay. The hosts were always very accommodating!! Checked up many times throughout the stay. Wish we could have spent more time at the actual house! Couldn’t have asked for better people! It even smelled clean when you walked in. Very close to gas stations also! Make sure if you book this to see places in tennessee, add an extra day to just enjoy the house!"

Stayed one night","Wow! This place was just so great! The hot tub and the pool were so great to relax in after our exiting day white water rafting. The decor is so adorable with the beach theme and there are so many nice, thoughtful personal touches throughout the bungalow! We only got to stay one night and want to come back when we can stay longer! We will definitely be back again! Book this place you won’t be disappointed!"

Stayed a few nights","truly a great place to stay. this would make a great private place for a second honeymoon or even a place to get away and unwind and relax totally. the hot tub and pool are totally private and connected with your room and just made it an awesome time. would definitely stay here again anytime we're passing through. we stayed only 3 days, but now wish it had been seven or more haha. Beth and Carl certainly are great hosts."

Stayed a few nights","This bungalow had everything we could’ve needed - from toiletries and towels to kitchenware and games! The bed was incredibly soft and comfortable. It’s just enough space for two people. We enjoyed the hot tub and pool immensely. Elisabeth went above and beyond to make our honeymoon special with flowers and surprise treats (cheesecake and wine!). While we could’ve easily stayed at the bungalow the whole time, it was great seeing the books with local favorites and suggestions for activities. This host has thought of everything!"

Stayed a few nights","If u get the chance…..this place is a must stay!!! The Host were friendly, personable, and accommodating. They have paid attention to those little details (and then some) that women especially notice to make u feel like they had u in mind when they were furnishing it. The hot tub/lap pool was AMAZING and spotlessly clean, the linens and towels smelled good and the kitchen was stocked well with cookware and more."

Stayed with kids","This place delivers! We had an absolutely fantastic stay, just going back and forth between the pool and the hot tub for hours. My 10 year old basically lived in the pool house while we were there :) They also have an amazing triple shower head in this unit that’s quite lovely. Finally, of all the stays I have had, this one was the most well-equipped when it came to snacks. They even had fresh fruit for us! And dog treats if you brought your dog! I have already decided we are coming back when it’s cold out to experience this place in the winter!"

Stayed one night","We were so pleased with the amount of care that went into outfitting the Kick-Back Cottage. The hostess thought of everything. From linens to lighting to snacks to instructions, the thoughtfulness was so apparent. Sleep was deep, relaxation easy. Cleanliness was top notch. Check-in and out a breeze. And hostess Elizabeth was lovely! We didn’t use the pool but it was ready for us. Would have been fun but we just ran out of time. We had a 5-star experience."

Stayed with a pet","This place is just amazing, Beth is an excellent
host and receives you with bunch of things such
as snacks, fruit, plastic utensils, etc etc. Pictures
of the place cannot transmit the real feeling of
being there. I strongly recommend to visit this
place and I'll be back for sure.
Everything was clean as it can be. There is not common to find places like this with host that really care about the guests needs.
Thanks Beth!"
