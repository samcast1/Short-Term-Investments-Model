Stayed a few nights","We loved our stay at this Tiny House. Everything about it was perfect. The kitchen was very nice, with everything we needed to fix our breakfast. We were gone during the day for the local music festival, so that was the only meal we fixed there. The bathroom had a great shower and the towels were very thick and soft. There was also a washer and a dryer too. It's located in a remote spot on the owner's property and faces a wooded area. There was also a fire pit, which we did not have time to use, along with a unique hot tub! And just to tell you how much we loved this place; we have already booked it again for next year for another 4 days!"

Stayed a few nights","Gaynell is the ultimate superhost! Not only was her place adorable, clean and private, she had an entire list of local places along with printed out menus, as well as other local things to do. She told us about a local waterfall we could hike to, but unfortunately we were there for a wedding and didn’t pack the right outfits or shoes for hiking. She offered to help us find the wedding venue our family was getting married at and then sent us turn by turn directions when we refused her spending her Friday night showing us around! She was so helpful making sure we knew we would 100% not have service once we got up the mountains. She was extremely responsive and even rushed the cleaners to get us in early when we switched our trip from a drive to flying. There are also the most adorable goats roaming the farm. If we are ever in the area again we will 100% be staying in the mini again! Cannot recommend enough 😍"

Stayed a few nights","10/10 highly recommend. Just far enough out of town that you didn’t have to deal with people if you didn’t want to but a short car ride later and your there. Beautiful area, very peaceful. The only regret we had was due to the wedding we were attending. We didn’t have enough time to properly enjoy the area. It may be a tiny house, but we never had any issues with space."

Stayed with kids",It was an awesome experience in a tiny home. Everything we needed was already there for us. I would love to come back again. The only real issue was the bathroom door. It would lock us out or in. Had a hard time pulling it out each time. But we got use to it and became fine with it.

Gaynell is very thoughtful with her instructions for and directions to the property. The decorative lights hanging in the trees are very beautiful and helpful when coming in after sunset 🌅! This was our first time staying in a Tiny Home 🏡 and it won’t be our last. We are highly impressed with the layout and thoughtful accommodations! We hope to be able to return for another stay in the future! Sincerely, Jennifer"

It is immaculate and it has everything we need except for a dish washer but this does not prevent me from making good dishes and even bake our favorite chocolate chips cupcakes. We found several wineries and breweries around the area..toward Boone or Banner Elk. We love the hikes, and the view by the window. We felt so relaxed with this vacation. Maybe build 2 more tiny houses so that we can invite our friends and family to join us next time. Thank you.."

Stayed with kids","This place is cozy and beautiful. I could totally live here year round! She has all the little things that you need, from the fully shocked coffee and hygiene items to the extra big and thick bathroom towels. I absolutely love this because I can't stand a thin towel! The only thing I could think could possibly be missing, would be the metal smore roasting sticks and maybe a toaster. Everything is completely new inside. The appliances are perfect size and the kitchen is stocked with dishes and pot and pans. The place was perfect size for 2 preteens and myself. The place is extremely clean! The outside campfire is a peaceful area. They have a wood shed and provide an outdoor grill, as well as fire starting fluids. I didn't contact owner while I was there, because honestly they knew exactly what is needed for an awesome stay and had everything provided. I will definitely be back when I'm in that area."

Stayed a few nights","11/10 experience staying at Gaynell’s tiny home in Purlear. This property is in absolute perfect condition, and is beautiful. When I first pulled into the driveway, I instantly fell in love. You could really tell that she put a lot of love into this home, and thought about everything you could need whilst tucked into the farmlands. From the small makeup towels, to the games, to the laundry, this place was a great place to stay.
Check in and out was super easy, and the locks are very easy to navigate.
The property was VERY easy to locate, and is within a reasonable driving distance to many hiking spots. Boone is quite close by, and offers so many small shops to shop at and walk around. App state University was also very cool to visit.
Overall, Gaynell is a wonderful host. She provides spectacular suggestions for activities around the area, and responds to questions instantly.
Looking forward to coming back in the future!"

Stayed a few nights","Gaynell’s place is awesome! The tiny house is on the back of the family farm and is very private and serene! Purlear is a small community nestled in between two great mountain towns, Boone and Wilksboro. There is so much to do locally that this is a great mountain hideaways! Gaynell is so kind and accomodating! Her place is also very clean and just as described. You won’t be disappointed. As mentioned, it is a tiny home, so space is limited. You wouldn’t want to stay with more than two adults."

Stayed a few nights","The tiny was very tiny, quintessientally a studio with a loft space. It had a very nice kitchen and the layout was solid. I would say it would seemingly be better for single occupancy, maybe a couple. There were three of us and it was tight.
Ultimately our stay was great, we met some deer, a bear, a feral cat that gave us cross looks whenever it was around.
We also saw fireworks that were in between the main and tiny house (where we stayed). The rocky road to get to the cabin was a little rough, but doable.
We had fun, watching netflix and the such, the larger bed downstairs is the most comfortable.
Gaynell was a responsive, and thoughtful host."

They even left sweet candy for us. My husband and our one year old stayed here for 3 weeks, and we were honestly sad to leave. This bungalow will hold a special place in our hearts, and we will recommend staying there to everyone! We loved sitting on the spacious back porch and watching the lightening bugs in the evening. We are so thankful for Becky and her husband's hospitality! The drive to Wilkesboro isnt far and there are orchards & spots to grab local honey, just around the corner. The road is safe and people drive the speed limit. We couldnt have felt more at home! Thank you both again for being such fabulous hosts!"

It was CLEAN, and so intentionally decorated. Most tiny homes feel very bare since they usually don’t put much decor.. but Becky did a fantastic job at making the space feel warm & comforting like home but not cluttered! The back porch was perfect for us.. we loved sitting out for morning coffee! Beautiful surroundings, right next to an apple orchard, beautiful views of the mountains & only 20 minutes out from the nearest road! It’s such a great location we will 100% be back!"

We used it mostly as a place to sleep and clean up while attending a festival, so we didn't cook there or spend our days there. It fit our needs perfectly! The bathroom was great and even through the bedroom was small (da! It's a tiny house) it was very comfortable."

Stayed a few nights","Not really what I expected…
The description makes it sound like the home sits on a secluded parcel of land which is not the case, there are neighbors all around. The furniture in the home looks and feels like garage sale leftovers. It feels like very little effort has been made to offer someone a warm welcome and comfort. Bare walls and bare floors, no rugs. No curtains in the bedroom mean you have to get up with the sun. The bathroom is very old and worn out frankly. The best thing about the house was the very large television with lots of streaming options. Unfortunately, many of the free channels have not been set up through Roku, this would make a real difference. The kitchen has obviously been recently remodeled and does have most of the essentials you would require to stay a while and have the ability to prepare meals. The house was clean for the most part, just very basic. We arrived with one small coverlet on the bed and two pillows. After searching we did find a couple more pillows and some pillowcases for extra comfort. I also found a spare blanket and was able to use the provided washer and dryer to launder it as it was found on the floor. Not sure I would choose this property over a nice hotel. The owner was attentive and available when needed."

Nestled up on the top of a foothill on a quiet road, far away enough from town to be unbothered by the noise and traffic, but close enough to everything you’d need for a short or extended stay (two weeks in our case). Close also to incredible natural attractions–hiking trails in the mountains and the Emerald Hollow Gem Mine (where you can dig for rough gems in the creek or the clay!). I’d recommend this to anyone who wants to take a step back from a busy lifestyle to breathe for a little while, and maybe spend real quality time with close friends and family."

We saw the GoodYear Blimp fly over, something you don't see everyday.

Stayed a few nights","This little farmhouse is so very charming. It is hard even to describe. It was beautifully decorated (for Christmas) with trees, twinkle lights, flickery candles everywhere….it was just magical to arrive “home” to, especially to the dark. Even the bedding was Christmas themed and gorgeous. It is an old historical- feeling home, but beautifully renovated and oh-so cozy. It was very clean, warm, and cozy. We had all the amenities we needed for our stay. The hosts were quick to answer any questions I had and so friendly, though we never had the opportunity to meet.
This home is out in the country, and surrounded by farm animals and farm sounds….we LOVED it. And it is all clearly stated in the descriptions. It is a bit of a drive into the closest town, but it is a lovely drive, and well worth it. We would definitely recommend, and hope someday to return ourselves."

I was disappointed that it didn't have full kitchen, but with the crockpot, hot plates, electric cooker, etc., we are able to prepare nice meals. I'm not used to being so close to the owners, but it caused no problems. I hope to go back and visit with Stephanie and family. The German Weso heater was the highlight of the place. Once we lit it, the evening was spent researching it and shopping for one. The hike along the creek was nice. They're property is gem. Things more pluses, but I'll stop here. Thanks for the dog supplies, treats, bath towels, etc."

Group trip","The house was just as described. Very comfortable, peaceful, and unique. Great reminder of a time long gone in most arenas of daily life today. This is what families need lots more of today!
My only complaint was not having more time to just spend on the property. Our schedule was already taken by the US 21 Road Market and visiting with family in the area. Hopefully we will be able to return again!
May God richly bless this host and family for providing lodging for travelers coming and going in so many different directions, for so many different reasons 🙏❤️"

Stayed with kids","Absolutely one of the best AirBnBs out there! The farmhouse is absolutely beautiful and the pictures just can't do it justice. The kids loved it The adults loved it and was the best night sleep we've had yet. The stay was so peaceful too, think the entire time we were there only one car ever drove by. The lightning bugs were enchanting and the quiet star filled night so blissfully relaxing. We'll most definitely be checking for availability if ever in the area again and will certainly be recommending to anyone traveling through the area too! Can not say enough good things about the hosts or the stay, everything was absolutely perfect!"

Stayed with a pet","Wow. The pictures online don't do this place justice. It's a beautiful treasure. We spent almost a week here with my family (6 total, including 2 toddlers). The disconnect was exactly what we needed. None of us wanted to leave. The Farmhouse was beautiful and vintage yet updated with useful amenities. It was extremely clean and fresh. The first floor master bedroom was huge. Big enough for my husband and I, plus two toddlers. The upstairs bedrooms were also very spacious. The stairs leading up are a bit steep, but we traveled with a baby gate, so we didn't have to worry about the kids. My kids LOVED waking up every morning and looking out the window to see sheep, donkeys, and horses grazing. There is no TV, and we LOVED that! After my kids went to bed, we sat out on one of the two beautiful porches and talked for hours. Our family loved this place, and the owners were so lovely and hospitable. We will definitely be staying here again upon our next visit. Don't hesitate to book here!"

The hosts were some of, if not the most communicative hosts we've ever had. They sent details prep info and checked in to make sure everything was going well, that was appreciated.
The snacks and water were great, especially on check in day when we hadn't gone grocery shopping yet.
The home is about a 20 minute drive to North Wilkesboro Speedway which was absolutely perfect for our week celebrating NASCAR'S all star week.
Overall a great stay!"

The decor was simply beautiful! Our hostess was so kind and gracious, wanting to make sure we had everything we would need, and that we were enjoying our stay. The surrounding landscape was just stunning! We even enjoyed seeing the farm animals, the sheep and the donkeys - yet they were so quiet we wouldn't have known they were there had we not taken time to relax a bit outside with our coffee, just over at the fence where we could see them grazing peacefully on the hillside. We were there with three of our granddaughters, and each of them brought her own dog. They fit in nicely, were well accepted by our hostess, and I could swear they had almost as good a time as we had! I look forward to returning every time we visit Wilkesboro!"

Clearly, a lot of thought went into having the kitchen well appointed with appliances, beverages in the fridge, and even a coffee bar. In addition, there were jellies and preserves for purchase that they make on their farm! Everything about this lovingly restored farmhouse was charming and comfortable!"

Minutes from our event made it ideal for us. There was much thought put into the fine touches (e.g. soaps, shampoo, makeup mirror, games). When we reserved we had a dog but we subsequently lost him before our visit. It’s a great place for a dog, however, with dog-friendly yard, street, furniture and dog bowl. The house made for a perfect weekend to attend an event with good friends."

It was chilly at night, but I the little fireplace that’s on a thermostat heated the place just fine.
I highly recommend the cabin. If you’re looking for fancy this isn’t for you, but if you’re looking for rustic, it’s perfect!

Stayed a few nights","The cabin was a great place for me to get away for, reflection, prayer, and meditation in God’s word. The quiet surroundings and stream that was a stone’s throw away, made it an even more special place to be. I spent time on the screened porch enjoying nature, listening to the cascades of water and watching the squirrels feed themselves from the tree walnut tree in the backyard. My overall stay there was great, and just the place I needed. Thank you Miss Lisa for your hospitality, and the great place you share with your guests."

I love cooking and Lisa provided all the tools necessary to make any meal. This cabin is quaint, but that only boosted the romanticized log cabin atmosphere. We were very pleased with the internet and tv quality. We were able to watch and celebrate the premiere of our favorite tv show. This was my first time booking an airbnb; Lisa made the process so easy for us. She provided thoughtful amenities and suggestions on where to go in the area. I would love to return to this cozy cabin. Thank you, Lisa!"

I had the area to myself to explore, read/write, do yoga, and meditate. I did a lot of heaing and reconnecting with myself and nature while I was here. I'm truly grateful for my stay!

It’s exactly as described with a bed and linens that made sleeping so comfortable. A shower with great water pressure and I never ran out of hot water.
Lisa was a wonderful host, extremely responsive and offered a guide to the area that was really helpful.
I visited many on the list and also a 10 minute drive to Cooper Barrel Distillery that offers tours, Stone Mountain State Park with beautiful waterfalls and so much more the area offers.
Thank you Lisa for having me in your beautiful cabin and I definitely sat on the rock and relaxed by the stream in your backyard, it was heaven."

The photos of the place do it justice, but somehow it's even cozier and more comfortable on the inside - like a Hobbit house without being underground. Just big enough for a couple to share together and every aspect of the experience has been thought of in advance - the small flashlights, the nightlights, the snacks in the kitchen, the tiny table and writing desk - I definitely felt like a welcomed guest and that Lisa absolutely deserves the title of 'Superhost'.
My only disappointment would be that I didn't leave time to stay a second night."

Stayed a few nights","I absolutely adore this cabin. Lisa thought of every possible want / need and so much more than expected. This is perfect for one or two people and super access friendly for those with mobility limitations! (Senior guests with canes or walkers, visually impaired.) there are two large comfy swivel chairs inside instead of a typical loveseat which suits the sitting area ideally. road access is flat and off a main road, making this a viable option for winter visits in snow or ice. Excellent WiFi and a kitchen that has everything possible to cook every meal if you have special dietary needs and need to prepare meals. Lisa was responsive and warm and super accommodating. The cabin is much more private than I expected- you have your own acre lot that’s not connected to a main house which was so unexpected! You are still close to neighboring houses but plenty of privacy. Since I’m a female who travels solo often this was felt so safe but still private. And the creek! So close to the cabin and gorgeous shaded serenity! I usually stay different places even I travel to the same area and find favorite airbnbs. But honestly It’s hard to beat all the perks of the pioneer cabin. Absolute gem!"

Went down to the creek and enjoyed the sounds of the rushing water....(not too rushing-kids can play safely)- you can walk right into it and swim. The land scape is beautiful...the trees ...the mountain breeze blowing through the screened in porch...Lisa had the place wonderfully stocked with goodies and amenities...like nothing I have seen before! this place might be little ..but it gives back big in enjoyment, relaxation and fun.

Stayed a few nights","The home is old, but refurbished and clean. The driveway is right on the main street in a mixed semi-industrial/commercial/residential setting. It was 1 mile from downtown, which was great for us as we were attending a downtown music festival. If you're looking for a luxurious home with a view and charm, this probably isn't it. But if you want a good clean basic 3br/2ba house while enjoying all that Wilkes Co. has to offer, then this house is just fine. The gameroom off the kitchen is quirky, but great fun!"

Stayed with a pet","We had such a great time at Hilltop Haven! Everything was perfect! Emilyne reached out and said we could check in early AND that she had left out a high chair and a pack n play with fresh bedding since she saw we had a 10month old coming with us - SO appreciated! Upon arrival, everything was beautiful and spotless. The kitchen had everything we needed just like the rest of the house. There were games and puzzles for the kids to play with and plenty of places to sit and enjoy the cabin both inside and out. The beds were comfy and all we needed as well. The ONLY downside I could possibly say about this place was 100% foreseeable, but we took a chance anyway. We brought extended family with us and since the upstairs bedrooms are loft style and open, I have to admit that trying to lay a 10 month old down for naps and bedtime before everyone else was ready, was a bit difficult just because of the lack of privacy/seclusion. Next time we’re coming back just the 4 of us and we can’t wait!"

The cabin was clean, beds were super comfortable foam mattresses, and there were plenty of toiletries, dishes, pots/pans, grill tools (and a grill), outdoor seating, etc to make the visit easy and comfortable. The check out requests were also reasonable. It’s a quiet neighborhood that’s easy to find, although I imagine more difficult to get to in the snowy/icy months (long, steep hill). John and Emilyne were great! Extremely responsive and accommodating of requests if they were possible. They also have a list of neighborhood walks and area hiking trails if you want them. I highly recommend staying here if you want a restful time away."

Group trip","We visited the area to ride dirt bikes at Brushy Mountain motor sports park. This is a very rural area so finding a nice place within reasonable driving distance is not easy. The cabin suited our needs and everyone felt it was a great choice despite the 40 min each way each day commute. We anticipated the need to bring all our supplies with us (food/drink etc) so for us being in this rural area presented zero issues and honestly, It actually added to the amazing experience our entire group of four enjoyed. (Two others canceled) need that actually turned out to be a blessing because because Brushy is a challenging ride so it’s not suited for the light hearted. Well arles not the sections this group of four chose to ride. We already have the last week of Oct booked to return so that should tell you all you need to know. Great place but bring your supplies unless you want to shop at the Dollar General or Boone post office lol. 👍👌Bill"

Stayed with a pet","Book it now! This home is gorgeous and loaded with everything to do. Wilkesboro is super convenient only a short 25 minute drive. The view is absolutely stunning and the porches are both perfectly set up for enjoying the peaceful outdoors. The house is loaded with games and things to do no need to leave, only for some groceries. The road leading up to the cabin is very curvy and narrow so prepare yourself for that but it's so worth it. Kitchen is a bit small but the rest of the house makes for it in size. I love that the upstairs lofts are separated by a good size walk-way making the rooms still seem private. The hill outback to the burn pit is a bit steep.
John was very responsive and super friendly. The house was truly phenomenal and I think my family and I will make this our yearly trip."

Parks, fishing, hiking are all nearby. But this cabin had a truly breathtaking view, and quality of the lodging was fantastic. Front deck rocking chairs for a laid back evening, and back deck high chairs for coffee and to take in the view all day long. Our hosts truly provided a stay where you didn't have to leave if you didn't want to - kids games, board games, leisure games, gym equipment, fire pit and more. They even provided three walking/hiking routes around the property and links to nearby hiking. Would 10000000% recommend and hope to come back again."

Stayed a few nights","Our trip was mainly focused around being in town for the NASCAR races. This cottage was great, a very quiet and peaceful stay. The hosts were very accommodating and respectful of our privacy. The cottage was very clean and well stocked. I’m planning another trip in the future and I hope this is available for us to stay in again. Would recommend this cottage and the hosts to anyone at any time of the year. Thank you!!"

Stayed a few nights","WOW! In our 9 years of using AirBnB on our many get-away trips, Jefferson and Deborah's cottage is one of our TOP TWO favorites!! Courteous and friendly hosts with neat stories and information. We had such nice conversations with them. The grounds are beautifully kept. The cottage was in a cozy location away from distractions and noise. We slept like babies! Super clean. Nicely decorated. Impeccably organized. Excellent WiFi. I wish I didn't have to work at a nearby business more than I expected or my wife and I would have enjoyed more of the Wilkesboro area plus the cottage's back porch, the barbeque, and the comfy patio chairs. I hope my work calls me back to the area this summer so we can stay again. THANK YOU!"

The little cottage heated up like a charm, as it was pretty chilly when we arrived.
The master bed was so comfortable we slept like a dream!
It’s a quaint place that has everything you would need whether it’s for a few days or a couple of weeks.
There were plenty of places to walk our puppy both on the property and surrounding neighborhood.
Both hosts were very responsive to our questions.
It was the perfect place for our short trip, and I’m sure the gardens look beautiful in the warmer months!
We’ll have to come back and check it that out!"

We even booked it an extra day after our classes were completed and only 43 minutes to Boone North Carolina to enjoy even more mountain views. Thank you again Jefferson.

The cottage has everything we needed for cooking meals and places to lay out our textbooks and study/do homework. We spent all of the time that we weren't in class at the cottage, utilizing the space as well as strolling the beautiful property or relaxing on one of the two porches. The owners have extensive plants and gardens all around, not to mention the forested area behind the cottage. The place was very peaceful. I would consider taking more classes at the community college in Wilkesboro just for an excuse to go back to our little cottage. :-)"

The surroundings on the grounds for you to walk on were gorgeous with the prayer gardens and the trails were so amazing. It was out in the country but yet like a 5 min drive to town. My car broke down 2 days after I got there and Jefferson really helped us out by getting my boyfriend to the college where he had class and was able to find us a vehicle. They were very reliable and gave great places to go have fun....the Peach Festival. If you are looking for a romantic weekend or even a week, I definitely give this home 10 stars 🌟 We will be returning in the future💜"

The cottage was furnished with everything I could have hoped for. The bed was comfortable and the owners left a detailed instruction book for everything, which I greatly appreciated.
Unfortunately, about midway during my stay the owner’s two Great Pyrenees dogs escaped from their fenced area and attacked me and my dog. Thank the Lord Deborah was outside and able to help me keep the dogs from getting my little dog,which is what they were after. Amazingly, there was no physical injury and we completed our stay without incident."

Stayed a few nights","My stay at Blueberry Hill Cottage was the best of what Airbnb is about: Gracious hosts sharing their beautiful space. It was as private as could be, but they were right there if needed.
Everything about this little cottage fed my soul: just what I needed. It was near enough to businesses that I could fulfill my work obligations, but such a tree-top hideaway that I felt like I was way farther away up the mountains. Truth be told, I ditched much of my ""homework"" to give in to a mini-vacation on the sunny deck : )
As a non-pet person with allergies, I was a tiny bit worried, but no need: everything was SO clean and fresh, no hint of animals. And I like to cook while traveling. Though I didn't this time, this place has everything you would need to!
Special shoutout to the hot water and water pressure that made for epic showers (do bring your own amenities, though!)
Treat yourself to a truly convenient and lovely getaway here: I'm definitely plotting a return!"

The cottage is spotlessly clean and comfortable and has everything you could possibly need. The king bed is super comfy and the large walk-in closet gave us a place to store all our luggage and “stuff”. There is a super laundry room downstairs. The location is great! Just a few miles to anything you need for shopping and restaurants and only 11 miles to Moravian Falls. We most definitely have this on our “most favorites” list and will be back again. Thanks Jefferson and Deborah! You were great hosts.

The property is very tranquil - there was even a baby bird’s nest in one of the planters out back! So precious 😍.

Stayed a few nights","Blueberry Hill Cottage is beautiful and it was perfect for my six-night stay. If I thought Jefferson and Deb would have me as a tenant, I would have been tempted to make my stay a permanent one! (Only halfway kidding!) I had a friend in town for the same event that brought me to Wilkesboro and she chose to stay at a local hotel. When she came to the cottage so that we could carpool to the festival we were attending, she agreed that I had made the FAR better choice. I had everything I needed. The bed was so huge and so comfortable that I think I could have had a family of strangers sharing it with me and I wouldn't have noticed that they were there. I slept like a baby. The neighborhood is extremely quiet except for the sounds of nature, the landscaping around the entire property is like Eden, the back deck was a respite after long, exhausting days. The hosts were available and we shared friendly texts but I didn't need one single thing that hadn't been provided and they gave me complete privacy which it made it seem as if the place were my own. I can only hope that they will have me back again next year!"

Stayed with a pet","Wonderful! Super clean, we had everything we needed for a week long stay and plenty of space for our belongings and two dogs. The property and the neighborhood are beautiful and convenient to everywhere we wanted to explore. Best mattress ever and great water pressure. The washer and dryer were a great bonus, as was the rear deck - we spent many relaxing hours there. We’ll be back! Jefferson and Deb really are excellent hosts. We had numerous thunderstorms during our stay and the Wi-Fi never wavered."

Stayed a few nights","Deb and Jefferson were great hosts, and they communicated propmtly throught my stay:) the cottage was perfect! The back porch at dawn with my coffee was delightful, with the birds right in front of you singing on the deck. Also, i took an adventurous walk, down the backside of the backyard property thru the right gate and through the brush out the gate (wear good tennis shoes, and bring your phone for gps for at the end of the road). There is a pathway that views farmland and rolling hills as far as the eye can see. Also, you will see deer and lots of rabbits. The bed was soooo comfortable. If you close the bedroom door, you will be amazed at the total silence--it was all perfect!"

We so enjoyed the serenity it provided. Our four-legged fur baby had the run of the property which was fenced in to keep him safe. It was clean and very well maintained. Jefferson was available for communication and quite pleasant. The cottage is just as described in the listing. We enjoyed our time at this peaceful retreat.

The cottage has everything to make your stay enjoyable and Jeff & Deb spoiled us with their great southern hospitality. The ability to bring our dog was a big plus for us. The cottage's yard was a great place for exploring. The cottage is very private even tho it is on the main house property.
The small towns of Wilkesboro and North Wilkesboro are located in a very historic area with nice main streets, good restaurants/food trucks (reasonably priced), small shops, and friendly people. There is also a mall area with a Walmart, chain restaurants, and grocery stores. The cottage is within 40 mins of Boone, NC, and the Appalachian Trail.
We spent two months in Blueberry Hill Cottage this summer to escape the heat of FL. We really enjoyed our stay and getting to know this part of NC."

Deer in the front, deer in the back, cows mooing from the farm behind the trees, a turtle right by the front of the cottage as well as a little Finch sitting on about six eggs in a nest right next to front door...plentiful wildlife. My wife and I had the most amazing month-long stay at Jefferson's secluded cottage and also enjoyed walking with our dogs around the waterfalls and numerous other fun activities in the area. The cottage at Blueberry Hill is landscaped and decorated with the love and passion for detail that would make Better Homes & Garden magazines turn green with envy. Above everything was the phenomenal hospitality that Jefferson and Deborah showed us from day one and every day after. This is a truly blessed place, the Airbnb rating system does not provide the amount of stars that Jefferson's cottage at Blueberry Hill deserves!"

As for amenities, my daughter and I spent Thanksgiving here, and we had everything we needed to cook a fine feast. When not stuffing ourselves, the couch was comfy for watching holiday movies on the big flat-screen or surfing holidays sales with the strong wifi signal. And the back deck was a special treat--we sat in the sun both days and enjoyed the nature around us, including watching a young buck wander by one day and listening to the owls each evening. The water pressure in the shower was great, and the mattress on the king bed was divine! We're so happy we found this place and definitely recommend it."

Netflix and wifi are included and definitely made us feel more at home. The next morning I was pleased to see the Keurig coffee maker ( not that commen in my air bnb experiences.) The kitchen has more than the expected necessities. The bottles of water were a great grab for our kayak trip. The cottage is close to the main house but is located a bit down the hill as to offer a lot of wanted privacy. You have complete privacy off the spacious back deck where you are amongst the tall pine trees.

Stayed a few nights",Jefferson and Deborah were excellent hosts. They accommodated an earlier check in due to us being in town a little early. The cottage is very quiet and the gated and fenced property adds that extra peace of mind and security. The price was perfect. The cottage was beautiful and very clean. We will definitely be booking again in the future!

Stayed a few nights","I booked Blueberry Hill Cottage for my trip to my brother's wedding in Elkin, NC which was only a 35 minute drive (very scenic drive). Blueberry Hill cottage is near shopping such as Wal-Mart, Aldis, Marshalls, Food Lion, Petsmart Chik Filet, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Big Lots, gas station's and many other stores and restaurants. The property is also near major intersections and highways.
I felt safe and had privacy at the same time knowing that the property owners were near yet I had my own space. Not being familiar with the area this brought me peace of mind. The property is also in a very nice residential neighborhood.
The cottage is equipped with a full size kitchen and private full size washer and dryer (downstairs) and a spectacular outdoor deck to enjoy your morning coffee or a cocktail.
Unfortunately I got sick with laryngitis and strep throat and wasn't feeling well to check out by noon; I communicated this to the Jefferson's and they were understanding and allowed me to check out later. They are available so you aren't really on your own unless you want to be.
I highly recommend staying @ Blueberry Hill Cottage. Thank you for a great stay ❤"

There was lots of linens and paper products left for us to use. But there is not many places to hang your used towels to let them dry. There is no water hookup for the fridge so there is no ice. Overall, a nice place for a short stay."

Very spacious areas but not for the over 6 foot folks, otherwise you can’t stand in the showers and have to bend to get through doors which was my husband experience but not a big deal either. We couldn’t get the dishwasher to work nor the ice maker but that was probably on me not knowing how to use the fancy appliances lol. Overall a very nice place to stay and would definitely book again."

Our trip was to visit extended family and do some genealogy research. They provided us with information for the Wilkes Heritage Museum, and they made available many brochures of things to do in the area, including a binder full of restaurants and their menus. We really enjoyed the time we got to spend chatting, and even discussing how we may be related to some of the people they know. The house itself was pristine and well stocked with linens and other basic needs. The house is well maintained and craftsmanship is beautiful. I highly recommend staying here and will definitely look to this listing first if/when we make the trip again.
Thank you for making your home available and a comfortable place to be."

Stayed about a week","Patrick and Toni have a very lovely home. Both were there to greet us on arrival and go through the house with us. Very friendly and welcoming couple and quick to respond to you on any questions. There were a basket of treats in the kitchen, coffee for the coffee maker and pods for the Keurig as well as tea. There was also some individual juices and water in the refrigerator.
We used all three bedrooms and no one had complaints about the beds and all had a good nights sleep.
The house and property was all very clean and neat. Loved that each bedroom had it's own ceiling fan and wall air conditioner. When we visited there was no need for air conditioners but we did use the heater four morning for an hour or so to warm up after a cold morning.
There were brochures on things to do in the area and restaurant menus to look at as well. The only negative was the refrigerator compressor ran about 40 minutes of every hour and froze food in the refrigerator. Speaking with the hosts it sounds like they will be replacing it very soon.
One thing that I personally loved was there was no less than 5 sets of dishes one of which is a Christmas pattern and another a china set. Everything in an exact setting of four including your silverware.
There is no one but those listed on your reservation allowed on the property so if you wanted to have a visitor for coffee you are not permitted to do so and that was very disappointing. If you are there for just a visit to the area then this is a must stay location and you will not be disappointed in the rental.
Thank you Patrick and Toni for sharing your Millers Creek home with us."

The interior is decorated to feel cozy, yet it gives plenty of space to relax or work on online studies. Patrick and his wife Toni are a real pleasure to meet at check-in. They have thought of all the little details that you might want or need and they have them for you. When you arrive, you feel like you are chatting with friends and coming to stay in their home. Their friendliness and hospitality went above and beyond what I expected! The lighting is great, the kitchen is well stocked with cooking equipment, and the bed was comfortable for a sound night of sleep. The house is spotless, smells fresh and clean, and is the perfect place to stay! I look forward to more opportunities to stay here; it may become my home away from home."

The beds in the 3 bedrooms were comfy with their own ceiling fans & window air conditioning units. The kitchen had little thoughtful snacks & everything needed to cook our own meals. The single bathroom had a tub/shower & lots of towels, soap & shampoos. For a good night's rest in your own quiet place, you can't beat the reasonable price & hospitality!"

Stayed one night","This is one of the best Airbnb I have stayed in !!
It should be listed as a luxury home because they have really thought of everything!! The kitchen cupboards are full of anything and everything you could possibly need ,they have a single cup and a large coffee maker in case you prefer one to the other.They not only supply the coffee but bottle water too.There are so many special touches I don't know where to begin , there's All the brochures of local places even a new paper ,they have extra toiletries in case you forget something, there's high speed wifi and extensive cable channels to choose from. I love the writing desk .
This house is very close to wilkesboro and there's a food Lion about 2 miles away but you would never know it because the house sits on 5 acres and has big manicured yard ,carport and more it's very secluded and yet so close to everything , it is very quiet and feels like out in the country being on a dead end road there's virtually no traffic around.
This home has All the big amenities that people love .
You will really not see the owners except for when they meet you to get you checked in and make sure you know where everything is after that they're gone and will answer any questions as soon as you ask them through texts.
You won't find any other home where you are using the entire house and all that comes with it for such a great price . I have found our home away from home when visiting our grandkids."

The house was the right size for us . The home looked newly remodeled. It was completely spotless. It had just the right amount of furniture for it's size. If I have to bring my work team in this area again for multiple days, I will definetly stay here again. Jim was easy to communicate with, and we really enjoyed the experience at this home. It was our first work Air b&b and will not be the last. Thanks again Jim for having an excellent place to stay."

Stayed a few nights",I will give Jim a 5 star rating because he was great. Our plans got changed and we were unable to make our stay. Jim was understanding and easy to communicate with.

Stayed one night","Lesa and Mark have a beautiful place with gorgeous long range views. They have all the accommodations you could think of even the little things like a cellphone charger, small fan in the bedroom, binoculars, a few extras in the kitchen, games, and toys for kids, etc. The back porch is large with plenty of seating where you can just sit and relax. The beds are very cozy and the unit is decorated very nice. Loved that check out was later than your typical checkout (12 PM). Our overnight stay was very peaceful and relaxing. Would definitely recommend and will be back to stay."

Stayed with kids","Lesa was very responsive. No issues. Stay was overall clean and comfortable. Nicely decorated, very cozy. Beautiful views off the back porch which was private. Loved the electric fireplaces in the rooms. Had some nice amenities such as coffee and some basics in the cabinets. Only thing (not even really a thing )was there were a few stink bugs but I hear that's very common in the mountains. No other bugs or anything I would be actually worried about. The beds were very high which I love and the host was thoughtful enough to have stools for us short people LOL. There were a few little toys which was great for our kida. Heads up the neighbor has a dog who sleeps on the porch. But it is friendly and did not bother us or our toddlers at all."

Stayed a few nights","We absolutely LOVED staying here!! So beautiful. The apartment is comfy, clean and gorgeous. I haven’t slept so peacefully in years. Great contact with the hosts. Wi-Fi is great- my boyfriend had to work remotely from here while we were on vacation. I saw deer off the deck every day. I love to cook and the kitchen was perfect, too. We stayed a week and will stay here again next time!! Thank you so much!"
