Stayed with kids","We truly enjoyed our time here. We were just in for the weekend but it is a beautiful home in a beautiful setting. Emily was extremely helpful and kind throughout the stay. She was quick to respond to everything. Everything in the home felt new and updated. The home gave us time to visit and was perfect. If you are in the area in need of a place to stay, I highly recommend this home."

Stayed with a pet","This home was absolutely beautiful and luxurious! The kitchen had everything we needed and more. The house looked like a model home, fully furnished with beautiful furniture. It was wonderful. The outdoor seating areas were so nice and we were able to sit outside and enjoy those beautiful surroundings.
Emily was incredible. She was very responsive to any questions we had and even gave us a heads-up about some weather developments coming our way.
We had a great stay and if we ever come back this is our choice of homes.
Thank you so much, Emily!"

Group trip","Emily's house was exactly as described. It was easy to locate, very clean, very well stocked with the essentials (toilet paper, paper towel, bathroom towels, soaps, she even had extra toothbrushes in case you forgot one). The rooms were very clean. She had a good mix of modern and antique decor. There was one other couple with us and she fell in love with everything about the house. We would definitely stay there again!"

There was plenty of room for the six of us, quiet country setting and only 25 minutes from the course. We didn’t spend much time there but enjoyed it while we were there."

Stayed a few nights","The Copper Top house was exactly as described--only better. This beautiful home is situated on a farm in a quiet community.
Emily was amazing and thought of everything. She was very responsive and proactive.
The house was very comfortable for our party of 5. We weren't there during flower season, but I really want to go back. I'm sure it's beautiful. The back porch overlooks a pond. Peace and quiet abound.
Emily's place was beautiful and comfortable. I can't wait to go back!!"

Stayed with kids","This was our second time staying at Emily's house and we enjoyed it very much. We would recommend it to everyone. I'm sure it would be beautiful when the Coppertop Flowers are in bloom, but we were there in the off season. Maybe next time we can be there when it's all in bloom.
Emily was so helpful, patient with all my questions, flexible with our large group, and very quick to respond. You can tell the work and effort they have put in to make the house comfortable and accommodating.
Thanks again!"

Stayed with a pet","It would be easy to say that the best thing about our stay was how quickly and kindly Emily responded to fix my error when I booked the wrong dates and of course we are so grateful that she jumped right in to ready the house to allow our family to meet BUT there are many wonderful things about our stay. The house was immaculate with all the amenities and at a peaceful location. The visit to the antique mall on Saturday let me learn about shared interest with my son and daughter in law. The downstairs primary suite made it easy for my in-laws to stay without having to navigate the stairs which was perfect.
Thank you again for being the kind person that you are and for making our stay comfortable."

Stayed one night","We felt right at home as soon as we walked into Copper Roof House. Emily thought of everything when decorating and supplying the house with items that may be needed for an overnight stay. The farmhouse feel and antiques are a perfect fit. The comfy beds and furniture are great and having 2 1/2 baths are great when trying to get everyone ready in the morning. Emily went out of her way to make sure we were able to get in, facilitated a meeting with her family members at The Heart of Ohio antique mall (dream come true) and made suggestions on places to eat in the area. We had a quick sibling overnight trip that was stress free thanks to Emily."

Stayed with a pet","We had a great family gathering. We come to the area each year for the Trans Am Nationals that are in Bristol OH. We were about 20 min from festivities, but wanted to be out of the hustle and bustle of the city. Our kids, dogs, and brother in law all enjoyed the amenities. The weather was perfect , we used the grill, did all our own cooking. We will probably book again next year, if not the year after. My oldest is getting married the weekend after TransAm Nationals next year, so we may be a bit busy. ha ha. WE ENJOYED OUR STAY VERY MUCH. Thank you!"

Twin beds were unstable and my kids almost fell off when climbing into bed. They had to get on a certain way or the mattress would slip off Frame.
We had to do a lot of clean up when we checked in(wiped down counters, dishes and table) and with check out, so we don’t understand the cleaning fee."

The house is nicely decorated, and parking is easy. Just note that if you stay in the summertime and it's hot, the A/C is via one window unit in the LR/kitchen and one upstairs in the main bedroom."

While the photos do accurately represent the place, somehow my imagination had it located in a very different setting. I thought it would be more rural but, it is in a neighborhood. Scott’s property boldly stands out as the nicest in the area. I was a little concerned about the neighborhood at first, but quickly found that I actually felt very safe and and was able to relax and enjoy my stay.

Parts of Springfield are old (houses built in the late 1800's and still occupied) compared to where we are from, but this was very pleasant oasis. My wife and I were very comfortable in this airbnb and would definitely rent again."

Very beautiful gardens and pond with waterfall and goldfish. Just keep in mind you will have to park on the street unless you ask the host to park in the rear yard. Was perfect location for my wife and I , only two miles from our Church Meeting. Thanks for letting us stay here Scott!"

It should be noted that Scott’s property & home are the exception in the neighborhood, and the surroundings may deter me from staying there in the future despite his remarkable accommodations."

Scott's garden and backyard were beautifully landscaped. He provided firewood so that we were able to have a fire in his fire pit on two evenings. We enjoyed listening to the water sounds from the garden. We will definitely stay again if possible when we are in the area.

It has a wonderful kitchen space, and I enjoyed soaking in the bathtub daily. The space includes a private deck with table and chairs. And yes, his gardens surrounding the entire house are something from a Hollywood movie set! Multi-leveled gardens, tons of water features including Koi ponds, and so many hidden wonders to discover! I highly recommend Pond View - prepare to be dazzled!"

Stayed a few nights","Thomas did a great job rehabbing an old house into a very nice space, with simple, yet tasteful decor. Everything we needed was there. A great reasonably priced space, however, he should probably advertise it as not a good place for senior citizens. While the bathroom was cute with the claw foot tub, no grab bars were available for getting in/out of it. Nothing to hold onto inside. And it’s not the place to go if you’re looking for a quiet time. On a very busy, noisy street. Long term rental upstairs with hardwood floors and no insulation make for noise as well. We could hear them talking like they were in the next room. But a younger generation may not be bothered by these things."

The heating system is pretty loud when it comes on and the shower is just a clawfoot tub with curtain - but those are relative small things compared with the space. Living room and dining room in addition to two big bedrooms. Looked practically new. Everything is super clean. Worth WAY more than I paid for it, for sure.

I travel with my Belgium Malios very regularly, and I was able to bring him. The backyard is large and fenced. although the fencing could use some work. nothing, some new main fence posts, a few 2x4s, and nails couldn't straighten up. Reuse and repurpose often. Going into winter, the landscaping was lacking and understandable. My boy didn't mind. The claw foot bathtub was AMAZING!!!! Gotta love a good bubble bath! I will definitely stay again in the future!!!"

Her place is beautiful and clean, with perfect and unexpected little touches throughout that make it a wonderful place to stay. The bed is comfortable, the bathroom is full of clean towels and extra things you might have forgotten and the living room has everything you need to relax and unwind. There's a charming snack station in the kitchen and behind the house you'll find beautiful horses to make friends with if you so choose. We've tried to stay at a few Airbnbs in Springfield now that our son attends the University there, and Teresa's place is by far the best we have stayed at.

Stayed one night","From the moment I booked, Teresa was helpful and responsive when it came to inquiring about the purpose for our trip as well as offering dining advice and other suggestions based on the reason for our stay. Even though our stay was brief, she had all the amenities necessary for a long stay. With the hospitality we were given, I would certainly stay here again in the future if need be. It was a great experience overall, no complaints! The hand written note was also a nice touch, something that you certainly wouldn't get if you stayed at a hotel."

Stayed about a week","What a wonderful home. What a wonderful host. We stayed at Terry’s for ten days and felt instantly at home. Her home is comfortable, clean and so peaceful. Terry definitely pays attention to all the important details including plenty of fresh linen and so many thoughtful extras including snacks and coffee. It was rather humid, and the air-conditioning and lush garden made us feel like we were in a cool oasis. The home is well positioned in a lovely neighbourhood in Springfield, yet close enough to the Interstate to make travel very easy. As a host Terry was unbelievable, she provided so much useful advice and even assisted with opening a suitcase that would not open. Terry responded so quickly to all our needs, and I would highly recommend this Airbnb. Personally, I loved being so close to nature with her beautiful horses and awesome property."

We visited the historical Clark county museum, an incredible history lesson. We will definitely be back. Don't forget to say hi to the horses! It's a quiet, peaceful warm place to relax.

My daughter suggested I try an Airbnb, I was not happy with what that search brought up either. Until I put in one search word- FARM. I am very glad I decided to do that, and check out the one and only listing that popped up within an hour drive of Columbus. I saw the listing noted that there were horses on the property, and being former horse owners, I knew that this was the right place for us. Teresa Joan's home was phenomenal!! It was clean, organized, and most importantly it was quiet. The home is located in a quiet neighborhood, and is surrounded by trees and pasture. We were able to meet Terry, and she was warm, friendly, and welcoming. My husband, 17 year old daughter, and I will absolutely be back in the future."

She was proactive in making dinner recommendations; she suggested the Speakeasy Ramen and the food, service and handmade cocktails were fantastic! Teresa is a very attentive host and had the extra bed set up and ready for our college-age son who was meeting us there.
Our trip was short - we were there for Cedarville’s graduation - but we could not have asked for a more adorable, clean, peaceful, and incredibly comfortable stay. She has gone the extra mile by providing bottled water, an attractive array of snacks, and quite a variety of coffee. She even had coffee creamer in the fridge and ready - fantastically thoughtful! Not to mention, she was impressive with her response time to any questions or needs that came up.

The host was incredibly accommodating and easy to communicate with. The place was clean and absolutely perfect for our needs. It was a horse lovers dream as well looked out of the bedroom window with a view of two beautiful horses grazing in their pasture. We will most certainly stay at this Airbnb the next time we are in town for a horse show. Thank you so much!! We are looking forward to returning.

The Stay was very comfortable even though their was no internet or smart tv which is something i use everyday , it forced me to basque in the serene atmosphere i actually detached myself from the matrix for a change which was very well needed; i felt free again...
but here's the real surprise I walked into the back of the property and was greeted by two beautiful horses which names were blaze & midnight i believe . Blaze was very social i fed him carrots , and celery and they loved every bit of it ; it really put a smile on my face"

We were a little bit nervous when we were driving out because it feels secluded, but as soon as we got inside we felt very safe and right at home!
Mindy is an EXCELLENT host - she had extra toiletries in case we forgot any, coffee, creamer and snacks! It was very helpful and made our long trip more restful.
The only thing I was confused about when booking was how much access the host would have to where we were staying. It isn’t advertised as “stay with Mindy” because you’re in a separate unit, but the house does have two units with the host on the other side!"

Stayed one night","We just needed a place to crash for the night on the road so it was nice that it was accessible to the highway. It was fine for that. The queen bed was comfy but the pull out couch wasn't great. Something on the couch smelled a little, like a wet dog. And I think it was the Roomba type vacuum that kicked in around midnight and made noise for quite a while, that should be programmed to not charge or cycle at night. It looked like the bathroom floor hadn't been cleaned judging by the drops in front of the toilet."

We didn’t sleep here, (was there for a few hours at night, but didn’t sleep) but did lay on the bed for a bit and it was comfortable. It was in a remote area, but close enough to a few small towns. The owner and her dog are on one side but were very quiet, if they were there when we were. Would recommend ."

Very peaceful area. Friendly host. We took our 10 year old Grandson with us and he went fishing in the pond and he was so excited when he caught a large bass. He was also excited that the fishing spot came with a dog to keep us company. We were visiting my Son and his family in Springfield and they brought their 4 month old Son to this location for a few hours to walk around and get some fresh air with the baby and they loved the property.

The kitchen had everything to make meals. The owner left numerous snacks and breakfast items out and some eggs in the fridge. Which is great especially if you arrive late and didn’t have time to make it to the store before morning. The outside has a pond and picnic tables etc. looks like there is much to enjoy outside. We were here in January rainy weather to visit our Son/Family and newborn Grandson in Springfield and spent much of the day there so we didn’t get a whole lot of time to check out the outside. Definitely one of the best rentals I have been to in recent years."

We were 40 minutes away from dayton and still preferred this to any other location."

We were so close to so many things that a city would offer yet the home had us in a peaceful solitude. The best equipped and stocked kitchen we have seen in a B&B."

Of all the places I stayed with AirBnB, this is stocked the best with both kitchen, supplies, and extra bedding. Just the way things are set up and communicated, you feel comfortable - like an appreciated and welcome guest.
Privacy is respected, yet Lisa is readily available.
Those of us that live nearby looked for other open dates to come back. You don’t have to go far to have a relaxing, restorative experience. This place really delivers!
And if you take a walk, their dog loves to lead the way!"

Lisa was quick to answer any questions, and check-in and check-out instructions were very clear. The country home and its surroundings are a beautiful piece of America, and we’d stay here again in a heartbeat.

Stayed with kids","This place was awesome. My daughter in law and grandson and I thoroughly enjoyed our three night stay. The house was so comfortable and well supplied, we lacked for nothing. The owners dog, and his company, 2 other dog relatives, came and made good friends with my grandson. Though we never got the opportunity to meet Lisa we met and were welcomed by her husband. Clearly both owners devote a lot of time seeing to the details to provide such accommodation. The cottage is truly the definition of ‘home away from home’. And the price is extremely fair, we got more than our money’s worth. Our only disappointment was that we weren’t staying longer.
ps, I’m usually not a reviewer but this place deserves praise."

Stayed a few nights","My neighbor stayed here in the summer and recommended it to us. Even though he described how unique and different this airbnb was to other properties, I was so pleasantly surprised once we arrived! This is a beautiful cottage nestled away from almost everything. Every morning we sat on the east facing porch drinking coffee watching the sun rise with a view of the pond. In the late morning we enjoyed hiking through the 2 miles of wooded trails on the property or fishing in the catch and release pond. On the property behind the cottage is an old concrete slab which has accent lighting, a bonfire pit, garden beds, picnic tables and other seating. If you love the outdoors and just being away from everything else, you will love this property. The cottage itself could not have been any cleaner or nicer. The host, Lisa, goes above and beyond to make sure you enjoy your stay! We had the pleasure of meeting Lisa and her husband....oh, and can't forget about Watson...one morning. It was an added bonus being able to meet them, learn about their family and the history of the property, and to be able to personally thank them for offering up their home for others to enjoy. We will definitely return next time we are in Springfield!!"

Set back near the woods on a large, updated property, this quality home is the perfect setting for a week of vacation or a weekend getaway. It's located just a short drive from Springfield and forty minutes from Dayton. Local history, points of interest, and information were provided.
Every detail of the cottage was so thoughtful and well planned. The art and and interior design is just beautiful and comfortable! The cottage is spotless and spacious, with 9-foot ceilings, solid surface countertops, full-sized appliances, five-foot shower, smart TV with great Wi-Fi, and a two-car garage. The front porch, deck, and lighted concrete patio give plenty of room to enjoy the peaceful outdoors. And Watson was such a friendly dog, tagging along for a walk around the pond. Lisa's cottage is worth every penny. You won't be disappointed.
Instructions were simple and clear, easy check in and out, along with Lisa's excellent communication. We appreciated so much the fact that food for making breakfast was provided (eggs, juice, yogurt, cereal, and bars). Pantry, bathroom, and cleaning supplies made it a home away from home.
Last but not least, the beds are incredibly comfortable, with quality bedding and three types of pillows--better than any luxury hotel suite. By far, this was the best AirBnB stay we've ever had. When we're in the area, we will definitely be back."

Stayed a few nights","Lisa's cottage is the perfect place for a relaxing getaway with friends or family. We cooked every meal in and the kitchen is fully stocked. Our 3 year old loved sitting by the pond and petting their dog, Watson. Check in and check out processes are easy. Highly recommend and would come back again in a heartbeat!"

We walked the trails, watched the geese and ducks on the pond, listened to birdsong, and especially enjoyed the sunrise across the pond with beautiful reflections in the water. Although rural, the location was convenient to all of the places to which we needed to go in the Springfield/Dayton area. Thank you, Lisa, for sharing this beautiful place with us."

Lisa went out of her way to provide us a home away from home - the fridge was stocked with juice, milk, and eggs and had a good coffee selection! We so appreciated all the little touches. Should it be available next time we travel to Springfield, this will definitely be our go to place!"

Stayed with kids",Our family of 2 adults and 2 children really enjoyed staying in Lisa’s cottage. The property is wonderful for letting children explore and relax. Watson the Dog was my sons buddy and a treat to get to be around. The snack and breakfast items really helped our family a lot after traveling 10 hours to get there and no time to go to the grocery before first morning. The house was cleaned impeccably and we felt very safe in the home. Lisa provided many great local options geared to the children and the kids enjoyed all they had in the area. We hope this cottage is available on our next stay.

From the front porch I enjoyed seeing the sunrise, listening to birdsong, and seeing the occasional pair of geese and ducks on the pond. It is very quiet and a perfect place to relax and enjoy nature.
The cottage had all the conveniences and comforts of home, but better! It was very clean, neat, and tidy with everything in its place. Great breakfast food and snacks! My nieces and I didn’t want to leave. I am planning a return with my husband."

Stayed a few nights","Nestled in the woods and farmland of Southwest Ohio, just northwest of Springfield, this hidden gem of a cottage was a wonderful place for my wife and I to stay for a much-needed weekend getaway from everyday stress and worry. The latter is not a word you would use when you reserve a day or two at Lisa's place, as she has taken care of ""everything"" from check-in to check-out - amenities and thoughtful touches are included, so that all you need are transportation, change of clothes, hiking boots, primary ingredients for meals (all the other accompaniments like spices, snacks, and supplies are found in the well-stocked kitchen), and a good book to read in front of the fireplace. The first thing we noticed after we drove along a cute little lane and pulled up to the cottage was how quiet and serene the setting was - the birds singing and lack of any discernable traffic drone helped usher in a peaceful feeling. After that, you'll discover a cozy, family-of-four-sized cottage to call your own - surrounded by lots of scenic woods, trails, gardens, and a fish-stocked pond directly across from the front porch. The cottage is very clean, with wood flooring and carpeting in the bedrooms. The living areas have plenty of seating with a soft leather couch and the fireplace is easy to use (kindling and wood included) and adds plenty of heat on cold nights like we had for our two night stay. The two bedrooms are medium-sized, and the queen beds and pillows (lot of them) are super plush. The bathroom features all the towels, soaps, and toiletries you would ever need. And again, the kitchen is well-stocked with supplies and includes a modern fridge, glass top stove, and ultra quiet dishwasher. So, overall, if you're looking for a getaway cottage for 1-4 that's ""move in ready,"" then look no further - Lisa can hook you up, and you won't regret it."

All without hidden cleaning fees or other 'gotchas'. Could not have been better! Will be back!"

But we ended up not being able to spend the night because the bed is the hardest rock we ever tried to sleep on. Lisa said she'll put a pillow top on it, but we think a softer mattress would be much better.
We gave 5 star ratings for everything but the bed."

We cooked meals here and found the kitchen to be well stocked in terms of pans and utensils. The bedrooms are cozy, though I would warn light sleepers that our bed was very firm and the bedroom curtains quite sheer.

Stayed with a pet","This was our second stay with Carla and Roy- and you best believe, we will back again soon! We LOVE this place, all the animals are so sweet and the hosts are magnificent! Make sure to check out downtown Springfield and Urbana during your stay- so many things to do! Collect your eggs in the morning and go down to pet the goats and cows, make sure to give Jeanie all your love too! George and Rosie will greet you every day with so much excitement (two chihuahuas). I could not name a better place to stay!"

We used to live on a 20-acre ranch in Texas and their place brought back so many wonderful memories. We would love to stay again, for a few nights should we find ourselves in the Springfield area again."

Stayed with a pet","The 2 bedroom apartment was very cozy, clean and pet friendly.
This is a basement apartment. The owners do live upstairs. If kids are running upstairs you will hear it. Access to the apartment is thru the garage and down several stairs. This is odd. Leaving early one morning was difficult finding our way out of the dark garage but we managed.
We stayed on a very cold weekend. There is not a separate temp control for the basement apartment and the fire place was not working. The owners did provide a space heater which was helpful.
Carla responded quickly to every question."

We loved using the full kitchen and lounging on the couch.Wish we had an entrance that wasn't thru the garage. Our poodle is 13 and we had to open the garage thruout the night to let him out.We were a little bummed the pictures for the lake were older pictures and not maintained enough for us to spend time there. Also was hoping for seating outside to spend time in the yard or eat outside. They did offer us camping folding chairs which we hung out in the driveway in a few times. The animals were definitely the best part of our stay. My daughter loved visiting the cows , dogs and goats. Check in was easy and host are friendly. They offered us a wood shop class and we unfortunately were able to squeeze it in. Overall We had a nice weekend get away."

Conveniently located about 10 minutes to downtown Springfield but also 30 minutes to Dayton or Columbus. Lots of small town atmosphere nearby with places to eat, ice cream, hiking(several state parks), shopping.
Located on a farm--chickens, goats, cows, dogs. You can get eggs from the coop for breakfast and pet as many animals as you like. My ""kids""(19 & 27) loved them.
We were also able to make pens in Roy's shop downtown--using band saw, drill press, lathe etc. which was a really fun family activity.
Carla and Roy were great hosts--great communication, helpful and friendly, but allowed privacy. They live upstairs so are handy if you have questions or difficulties with anything.
Overall, a great value, nice place, great people!"

The hosts are also super responsive and communication was on point.
The apartment is in the basement of the house, which you enter through the garage, so it can get chilly, but there is a gas fireplace that warms it up nicely. The space was clean, cozy and quite spacious. The fresh eggs in the morning is a really nice extra. We didn’t get a chance to use the zip line or the fishing pond but they looked like a good time!
With good weather, the property has a lot to offer for entertainment. If stuck inside, the tv gives good options but not much else to do. We brought some board games with us and enjoyed ourselves.
The bedrooms were cozy and dark, we slept great!
Overall it was a wonderful time and perfect Airbnb for me & my son!"

Just make sure you have someone in your party who isn’t afraid to take care of spiders! The rental is in a basement so we knew there would be a possibility and it seems like they are mostly by the rental entrance. Not a big deal for us at all!

Stayed one night",I like being able to get in and out of a place without any hand holding from the hosts. All the information given was sufficient and made for a great stay in my book. We brought our dog and her crate so she felt at home. The weather was rainy so we didn’t get to spend much time on the grounds but loved seeing the cows and goats in the fields.

We had everything we needed and Carla is very quick to respond. The farm fresh eggs you can pick daily makes breakfast so much more yummy! My husband and I will be back if our work travels head back to Springfield. Thanks Carla and Roy!!!!

My family (wife and 2 boys, ages 4 & 7) wanted to join me while I attended a few days of business meetings in Springfield. I was hesitant, but agreed. I'm glad I did. This place was great for all of us. It was comfy, cozy, and my boys loved playing around on the farm. Our hosts were very congenial and personable, even allowing my boys to tag along as they cared for their animals. The next time we are in the area, we will definitely check out the availability here before anywhere else."

Stayed with kids","The unit is not “new construction” but it is tidy and well appointed. Plenty of storage, soft sheets and clean towels. The entrance is in the attached garage down 12 steep and dimly lit stairs. There is no way to lock the unit from the outside so don’t bring your most prized possessions. The vinyl plank floors are buckling from moisture under the slab which would be a bummer if you’re bringing a baby. The pond is in the middle of the pasture with the calves, goats and herd watchdogs. Our German Shepherd was attacked by Janie the watchdog after entering the pasture. After I informed the owners they came down to check on her. The driveway is ruled by two tiny chihuahuas that will run towards an approaching vehicle. The kids were excited to use the slip-and-slide advertised but it is no longer available. My son enjoyed chasing the chickens and my daughter was amazed that they really do lay eggs! If you’re a light sleeper remember that it’s a basement and the owners bedroom/bathroom is right above where you’ll be sleeping. They do have cable and wifi but don’t expect to use your cellphone in the unit. We ordered pizza from Short Stop one night, it was pretty tasty and they deliver! I don’t think this is a great vacation destination like I had hoped, but it would make a good pit stop. Great value for the amount of square footage. Check-in and check-out was very easy, the owner even let us have an extra hour to get out the door."

Stayed with kids","This place unfortunately just wasn't for us. We were staying in the middle of a LONG drive back home. The beds were too firm, the pillows too thin. The room with the double bed didn't have a curtain on the window so I ended up sleeping with my kiddos on the queen while my husband tried to sleep at an angle on the double. There wasn't a sponge I could find for dishes and the bathroom wasn't stocked with the shampoo, conditioner, etc. the listing details. I messaged our host about if where I had parked was okay and didn't receive a response for several hours. Nothing to actively ""warn"" people against, this just wasn't a good fit for my family."

Our daughter loved the farm animals on the property and was especially sad to leave the cows. Communication was great with Carla and Roy, and we had everything we needed.
Just as a heads up to anyone concerned with staying connected, cell reception in the apartment is not great due to the nature of it being a basement/nearly no windows, but it was kind of a welcome time to unplug; the wifi still worked great."

Cooked meals in the kitchen (microwave, stove/oven, toaster) nice shower and a great couch with dual recliners to relax. We loved that it stayed so dark, and had some of the best sleep in a while.
The rest of the property is great, too! Our dog loved meeting the cows, chickens, and other dogs, and we had freshly laid eggs for breakfast every morning! There's plenty of green space to wander around, and they even had a little 2-person side-by-side bike to ride around in which was fun.
Roy and Carla are incredible, too. They were very respectful of covid precautions while at the same time being as present as we needed. We.were taking a break from the city to celebrate a baby that's due in a few months, and Carla even handmade some gifts for the little one, as well as some treats from her garden and kitchen for the two of us :)
We brought bikes and would recommend that to anyone interested, there are hundreds of miles of paved paths all over the area and it was great to be out and about in nature as our goal was to give ourselves a vacation while maintaining social distance.
Place was great, hosts were great, thanks again Carla and Roy!"

Stayed a few nights",Carla and her husband are kind people. They waited until almost 1 am for my arrival. Carla baked cookies for my friend and I and had them available upon arrival. The basement apartment was private and sparkling clean. The beds were very comfortable. The farm is in a very safe family friendly neighborhood. Carla and her husband didn't bother us but quickly responded to any questions that we had. She even gave me an extended checkout for free as she didn't have another guest checking in that day. My son attends Wittenberg University so I am in the Springfield area several times a year. I will definitely book at Boom's farm again. I really enjoyed my stay.

They let our kids feed the goats and collect the eggs which was super fun for them! They also put a small slide and a tent for the kids to play with in the apartment which they loved - very family friendly. Would definitely visit again!

Stayed with kids","Kelsey is a phenomenal host! She went above and beyond to help us with all our requests! That being said it is an old home and all the floors creak and it is tiny. My family has 3 young kids and while Kelseys place was well stocked in toys, a highchair, noise machine and pack n play, it wasn't the ideal stay for more than a day. There was no outdoor space and to get to the sidewalk, you had to go down 10+ stairs. Not ideal for a stroller and taking three kids out. But this home would make an excellent stay for smaller families or a couple!"

There’s plenty of street parking and it’s a quiet and safe neighborhood. Kelsey is a great communicator and always responded very quickly. Internet service worked great.
The location is perfect and in a very walkable neighborhood for food & coffee. I walked to Coffee Expressions daily and really enjoyed their coffee. There’s also a deli within a 5 minutes walk. While staying at Kelsey’s I treated myself to a hair blowout & style from Robert at Mallia’s Salon & Day Spa which is a 5 minute drive. I also recommend a drive to Hafle Winery for their sangria which is freshly made at the table and their pretzel bites with beer cheese.
I would love to stay at Kelsey’s the next time I visit Springfield."

We appreciated the decorative touches and even played a game of ""Sorry"". The kitchen was convenient. The WIfi worked well. We appreciated being able to have our dog with us. We enjoyed walking around the Wittenberg Campus. Kelly was very responsive in our planning and check out.
We would definitly stay here again.
These things were not a problem for us but if you have physical limitations you might find the outside stairs challenging and the toilet area a bit on the small side.
Otherwise we would reccoment the Berg Bungalow."

You only have access to the front door and the amount of grass available for the dogs is very limited and small. It took the dogs a bit to get used to it. Other than that, it was a beautiful stay and will absolutely stay there again in the future!"

A negative for us, but maybe not others, were the plug-in scented air fresheners. Many people, like my daughter and me, are sensitive to added scents; felt like like sitting next to someone with strong perfume. We unplugged them while we were there which helped, but there was still lingering fragrance."

Cindy’s property was perfect for my wife as she got some much needed R&R while I spoke at a nearby college. Wouldn’t hesitate to stay again if we were in the area, thanks Cindy!"

Stayed one night","The photos don't do it justice! The Sothard's Silo and grounds are absolutely beautiful!! We arrived late in the evening, and Wally and Vivi (the friendly farm dog) met us in the driveway to show us around. Wally had started a fire in the fire pit, and the embers were still glowing when we got there. We wish we'd been able to enjoy it earlier. Cindy and Wally have done an incredible job making the silo a home away from home. It is cozy, pristine, and well stocked with everything you would need, including bottled water and snacks. The bed and pillows are so comfortable that we've been inspired to upgrade our own pillows at home. The silo is located close to downtown Springfield with its restaurants and breweries, the Clark County Fairgrounds, and Yellow Springs. Cindy and Wally, we truly enjoyed hearing about your journey creating this incredible property. Thank you for welcoming us and allowing us to share in this experience!"

The real deal did not disappoint and the pictures online so do not do justice to the love and detail that was put into making this a home away from home. We were immediately made to feel at home and were able to enjoy a relaxing evening after a busy week. Cindy provided snacks, juice, and water in the fridge, as well as toiletries that I may have forgotten. The property is absolutely beautiful!
As a bonus, we ended our trip with a wonderful visit with Cindy and Wally. It was so nice getting to know you both and learn more about your adventure with the silo project. We were also shown another beautiful remodeled labor of love, an old FedEx van turned custom motor home. Thank you both so much for sharing your beautiful silo with us! Looking forward to returning for a longer stay once the weather turns cooler and once Wally gets that fire pit completed 😉"

Stayed one night","Cindy greeted us when we pulled in, showed us where to park and gave us a nice quick tour of the place. They have a lovely dog who also greeted us and walked us to the door :). The silo is actually on the same property as the house of the owners so getting in touch with the owners is a short walk if needed. This place is neat and cozy, comfy furniture inside and a great porch to sit on and relax. We fed the koi while relaxing in the bench swing by pond while listening to a chorus of frogs. The bed was good as well its nice and firm and the linens were clean and fresh. There are a few decent breweries in the area about 10 to 15 minutes from the property. Sadly we did not have enough time to some more exploring of the area. All the more reason we will make the 2.5 hour drive from Cleveland to stay here again and spend some more time. If youre thinking about staying here, stop thinking and book already, you wont regret it."

The only problem was that we enjoyed our stay at The Silo so much that we had a hard time leaving it to go to the Aullwood Audubon Center and Farm. The Silo is a destination in of itself. I loved it so much that we’re going back for my birthday in October!
Everything about The Silo was perfect. Cindy and Wally are definitely super hosts! They have created a home away from home for their guests. Everything that you could possibly need seems to be provided, from the free Wi-Fi and two Roku TVs to the water, coffee, breakfast items and other snacks. The bed was so cozy and comfortable that we both slept better than we do at our own homes.
Thank you, Cindy and Wally for sharing your beautiful Silo with us! We’ll see you in October. I can hardly wait!

Wally greeted us with a smile, showed us every beautiful handmade detail, and was so hospitable and kind. Cindy made sure to come and make sure we felt at home and checked up on us multiple times throughout the our stay. We were aloud to walk around the property, which was so serene filled with pastures, a chicken coop and koi pond, play with Viv, the sweet pup, visit with the chickens and feed the horses from the apple tree. It always felt so peaceful, private, and safe. The house was stunning, spotless, and filled with all the amenities and snacks you could ever need. The coffee bar was an amazing added touch ;) we truly felt like we were at home and made new friends we will definitely be back to see soon! Thank you again Cindy and Wally for allowing us into your space and we cannot thank you enough for making our night feel so special. Can’t recommend enough! WE LOVE THE SILO!! -Maris & Auna"

Stayed one night","We loved our stay at Cindy and Wally's silo! I will say, they are incredibly friendly hosts - if you don't like being personally greeted and chatting with your host, just let Cindy know when you book that you'd prefer a more private/no contact experience.
We didn't end up getting in until a bit later and Cindy even checked on us, which was very sweet! The property is beautiful and they invited us to use it all - there are mowed ""trails"" for walking on the property, horses, cows, and chickens to meet, and there is a very friendly farm dog named Vivi who we loved!
The silo itself was beautiful and very impressive. You can tell that a lot of hard work went into the renovation and everywhere you look is something that was meticulously selected. The kitchen is fully stocked with anything you would need and although the stove is antique (beautiful) and a bit clunky, Cindy and Wally provided a separate, private kitchen area just outside the silo. We can't wait to return!"

Stayed one night","Wow the pictures did not do this place justice. As soon as we pulled in Cindy and Wally greeted us and were eager to answer any questions we had and to tell us all about the silo and property. You could tell right away this was built as a labor of love and not just something to rent out. It’s absolutely gorgeous inside and way bigger than the pictures make it look. The bedroom is amazing!!! It’s the entire second floor with a gorgeous wood slat ceiling that goes up really high. Downstairs is the kitchen, living room and bathroom all beautifully decorated.
There’s a huge garden pond with waterfall by the silo full of koi and lilies you can sit out at and relax. My husband loved feeding all the huge koi fish.
Only 15-20 minutes from Yellow Springs, Young’s Dairy, and Fairborn which are great for shopping, playing, and enjoying nature.
Seriously if you’re looking for a night or two away this is the place. By far the friendliest owners and coolest Airbnb we’ve stayed in."

Stayed one night","By far one of the most comfortable and cozy tiny homes we've ever stayed in! It really should be considered a ""Country Farmhouse Bed & Breakfast"" with the amenities and the hosts offering of fress eggs in the morning harvested from the 20+ chickens that also call this farm home. The Southard's Silo is so unique and different because it was hand-crafted using mostly upcycled materials (including the grain silo itself of course!). The entire space including the outdoor smokehouse/kitchen with the relaxing front porch was designed with skill, imagination, pride, and most importantly love. Cindy and Wally are truly amazing souls with kind hearts and a desire to offer everyone a piece of their slice of heaven on Earth! We are so thankful to have found them on our journey in this life and will cherish their friendship forever! Cheers to Cindy and Wally and cheers to their wonderful Southard's Silo!"

Every rooms in the house was spacious, clean and neat, and each rooms provided the essentials that were needed for the stay. Teresa was very responsive each day. Ex: we needed a iron and ironing board, and could not find it no where in the house. Emailed Teresa about it that night; she responded in a reasonable time, and by morning a iron and ironing board was delivered on the porch. Overall, we had a great experience, the house was great, and we have no complaints. My family and I will stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","Teresa's place was perfect for our family to gather for Thanksgiving, birthday, and the big OSU/Mich game. Our 91 year old mother was able to manage the 3 steps in and out of the house, and she brought her 89 year old friend to share in the festivities. The kitchen was large enough to prepare breakfast charcuterie for our 24 year old's birthday, followed by a complete Thanksgiving feast. The kitchen had all the necessary appliances and all the extras surprised us. A turkey roaster, an ice machine, a crockpot, a Keurig with drip coffee option, a blender...I could go on. The old house was updated with such charm and good taste.
Teresa has been the perfect host and very responsive to our questions. If you like disc golf the reservoir has one of the best courses we have ever played and it is only a few miles away. We hope to rent her house again next month."

Living room has plenty of seating including a rocking chair the room also has an electric fireplace and a large screen tv.
In the dining room the table is large enough to seat at least 6 people comfortably.

The house was clean, cozy and felt like a home. Everything was very nice. I brought my two dogs and they were very welcoming with the dogs. The yard was large and secure which was nice because my dogs are smaller. It was a stockade fence so it felt private and the neighborhood was pretty quiet. It was also located very close to a state park which was really nice. We really enjoyed our stay and would happily stay again when we are in the area."

Stayed a few nights",We brought our two small dogs with us and they enjoyed their stay also. There was a large fenced in backyard for them to explore. Teresa was an excellent host. The house was spotless and she had extra necessities there in case we forgot anything from home. The area is quiet but does have a busy road. We felt safe and had a comfortable stay.

Group trip","This home was an excellent stay, modern everything combined with an antique look. Teresa was very easy to communicate with and offered a later checkout if we would have needed it. We had a late addition guest and Teresa was very accommodating. We spent time outside on the porch, it was very quiet and comfortable. We would highly recommend this stay to anyone."

Stayed a few nights","Great place, super clean. Kitchen was well stocked and everything was in good working order. It is in a quiet neighborhood, close to everything -- minutes from the historic downtown, and if you prefer the chain restaurants and shopping, it is close to that too. It was the perfect place for a long weekend. I would definitely recommend this place and would stay here again if we are in the area."

Stayed a few nights","Close by to a few stores. Easy to get around. Some fun things to do nearby too with arcade inside a gaming store. We were here for the eclipsed and had a nice stay thank you again.
Just to warn other people since ive done other airbnbs with friends. They dont give address til couple weeks before and the code for door wasnt given like normal in am. Was kinda nervous driving 8 hours and not knowing if we could get inside, felt like we didn't have a place to stay officially. Got the code like an hour before the time inside 😬. Besides that wonderful stay. Definitely will book again if in the area."
