Stayed one night","Easy to find & easy access from I-80. Very clean. Comfy bed. Big bathroom.
No lights were on downstairs which was unwelcoming and it was hard to find the switches in the dark (cell phone flashlight came in handy).
There were house rules that were not mentioned on AirBnB… a no shoe and no food policy downstairs where my room was. There were two rooms available but the one I did not reserve was open for me and the one I reserved was locked. I really didn’t want to sleep with all the animals (safari theme)
It was a nice stay for the price for sure. I suggested adding the house rules in the reservation description so someone would know ahead of arrival."

Air hockey was fun! Eddie & Michelle were friendly hosts. For your phone GPS directions, be sure to use the street address the hosts specifically posted in the listing and not the default one.

Stayed a few nights","Michelle was over-the-top helpful as a host. Although there are no cooking facilities downstairs, she provided her entire well-appointed kitchen for our use and a refrigerator downstairs for us to store our food. There is an amazing hot tub available in the downstairs area you rent; you can choose one or two bedrooms, but will always have the place to yourself. She also allowed us to store and unhook from our RV at her RV park, which was essential. We were there to visit the sandhill cranes, and there were close to 275,000 near Kearney. This was a tremendous experience for us all around."

Stayed one night","This is a great value. The hosts were quick to respond. The reclining couches and the big screen TV were a nice treat after a long road trip. The large bathroom and huge walk in shower was great for getting ready. The queen size bed and bedding (especially the sheets) in safari room were so comfy. But as I was laying there thinking how comfy and rested I was, I thought about how there were no egresses windows in the basement bedroom I was in and then realized I didn’t see ANY windows in the basement or an exit/fire escape route posted. (I did not open any doors that were closed in their bsmt looking, as we were on our way out) This might be an issue for people. I never gave it much thought, until then."

Stayed one night","Michelle & Eddie’s place was great. It was clean and comfy. We needed a quick night to stay, however I missed on the booking that we needed to check in before 11pm — definitely make sure you read everything and check your time zones. Their sleep before work is very important to them. We almost didn’t have a place to stay right before we arrived, after our 12 hour drive. No fault of theirs and I understood the frustration from my mistake. Thankfully they allowed us to keep our booking and sleep there while we remained respectful to their sleep. I would recommend regardless."

Stayed one night","My stay with Michelle was a mixed bag. I loved how at the end of my stay. She allowed me to use their campgrounds ice machine because I needed the ice for my coolers and the fridge. I didn’t like how there wasn’t self check in and it was a very awkward greeting. I was also late due to not accounting for the time difference between states. So I think that’s why it was such an awkward greeting. Coming from California, I did not realize that the basement didn’t have any windows, and therefore made me feel unsafe. This is all personal preference, however, and does not relate to Michelle. The listing was unclear. I thought I would choose my room upon arrival but I was informed upon arrival that I was not to open any of closed doors, and I had access to one room and the bathroom. As a solo, female traveler I felt the need to check all of the rooms for my safety, but I respected the hosts wishes and stayed in the space provided. Human hairs on sheets, stale smelling towels, hair in shower."

Stayed a few nights","First off I want to say our host was very friendly & their house was amazing, I especially enjoyed the jacuzzi tub. that being said, this stay was not your typical stay from Air B&B. when you arrive you have to come through the front door of the host's residence, & upon arrival the host was seated in the living room to greet us (not typical) we are then expected to remove our shoes and leave them at the front door (weird but understandable) then you proceed down to the basement through a non private entrance with only a ln indoor door lock on the door (not very secure). when we git downstairs to our room we were greeted by a stuffed animal sanctuary, not our taste in decor but someone may enjoy it. This was not an Air B&B only location, it doubled as a like family room. Next was the game room. It was listed as one of the amenities of the location but we got the since that we were not allowed to use anything. We could not access the pool cues do to air hockey placement."

Stayed a few nights","Excellent place to stay! Close to Kearney. Kitchen was just remodeled and looks fantastic! We did not use the kitchen, except we put a pie in the fridge. We did not use the laundry facilities. We did sit on the deck and enjoyed the location. We did not use the whirlpool but the shower was great. The place was just as described. The host was very friendly and communicated well. Beds were comfortable with nice pillows. We would definitely stay again! I would not take anyone that can’t manage stairs as you stay in a nice finished basement so there are several steps. There is a hand rail to use going up/down. The house is beautifully decorated inside and out."

Stayed one night","I was a last minute reservation around 7:00 pm and arrived 30 min after booking. Instructions were super clear and getting in was quick and easy. Now for the best part..... THR JACUZZI TUB. This was the nicest bath tub I have been in in my life, with jets and a waterfall spout. I felt like I bathed in the fountain of youth and my muscles forgot about the 20 hours of driving I had been through. For the price of a shabby motel I experienced peak luxury. The other thing that stood out was the toilet paper.... must have been woven by the seamstress of the gods. I forgot to ask what brand but my bum has experienced the royal treatment and I fear I can never go back. No window light meant I slept peacefully throughout the night and my sleep watch showed a perfect 8 hours before I opened my eyes feeling reborn. There may not be attractions in town but the basement of this air BNB should be one of them. The kitchenware was also brand new and high quality. 11/10 experience"

It was a very comfortable stay overall - plush carpet, easy to operate TV & comfy beds. In addition, we were traveling through to Kansas & Nebraska and accidentally left an item behind that was needed for graduation gift giving in Nebraska. Michelle called us right away and shipped it out to us same day at our final destination in Nebraska. We super appreciate the extra effort she went to to help us out with this. I would definitely book again on my next trip through the area! Thank you!!!"

Stayed one night","The space was clean, private, and comfortable as other reviewers have said. However, I’m not sure I can recommend due to a bizarre experience I had.
Before arriving, I messaged the host to ask if there was a possibility I could do laundry. She responded “the laundry is near the bedroom”, which I took to mean she was letting me know where it was. In the morning, around 9:30, I decided to do laundry before I left. The host came out of her room yelling at me that I disturbed her sleep and that she meant since the laundry was near her bedroom she didn’t want me doing it. When I apologized and said I misunderstood the message, she continued to yell repeating that she didn’t sleep until 2am, that her husband kept her up until 2am.
If you do choose to stay her, just be careful, because at least one of the hosts has both poor communication and a temper."

We weren't allowed to eat in the basement so we felt a little odd eating in their private dining room upstairs and having to use their dishes. But she didn't seem to mind and got the things out for us. Their house is just a minute or two off the interstate which was great for us!

Do note that not all GPS takes you to the house. It was dark when I arrived, and given the rural location it was hard to spot. In case you have that same problem, know that It’s the last driveway on the right, just before the stop sign, that detail would’ve saved me a lot of hassle and confusion ;)
I was only there about 11 hours but I was very glad for the stop! The bed is super comfortable and it felt much nicer than a roadside hotel."

Stayed a few nights","My son, mother, and I were in town for Rail Days, and picked this home because it was away from the traffic and other tourists in North Platte (but still easy to get to North Platte via I-80). The neighborhood felt super safe. When we sat on the front porch (taking great advantage of the wonderful weather, along with the rocking chairs and porch swing), neighborhood residents never failed to wave or say ""hello"" as they passed by. The house itself was very comfy and inviting, and felt like home as soon as we arrived. In you're a history or museum nerd (like me), make sure to stop by the Pony Express museum, which is just a few blocks away. There is a very nice super market (Fresh Foods) not far from the house. The house (and Gothenburg) was perfect for our weekend trip, but would also be great for an extended stay."

Stayed a few nights","This was a great private getaway from all the crowds while on a crane watching trip. The river was just down from the cabin as described and the property was great for a little hiking and exploring. We brought all of our food for cooking at the cabin and the kitchen was well stocked with everything we needed for food prep.
Towels and linens were clean and sufficient. There was a nice supply of board games for a rainy day, 3 SmartTV's, and a pair of binoculars for checking out any wildlife you may see at a distance. We definitely heard the wild animals in the middle of the night, but it justed added to the ambiance.
Check-in/out instructions were easy to follow.
Dishwasher, washer and dryer, coffee pot [cone filters], toaster were available and functioning
TIP: Arrive with your food, as the property is as described, off the beaten path. I imagine you will have a bit of a drive to the nearest grocery store if you didn't plan ahead. We were prepared for, and loved the seclusion."

Stayed one night","This place is a gem. My girlfriend and I attended a nearby bull sale and it really couldn’t get any closer. This place is quiet, private, and very spacious. The floor plan is super open and there is a ton of room to spread out. It more than accommodated just the 2 of us and could very easily host a multi-family stay. John was easy to work with and the self check-in with the keypad is a breeze. Do plan to bring your own food as there is not much other than condiments and town is a good distance away. You can definitely cook anything you’d want. There are pots, pans, cookie sheets, a crockpot, etc. The included washer dryer is also nice, we were able to run a load with little issue.
Do be wary of wildlife however. We arrived after dark and there were definitely critters hanging out on the front step when we tried to get in. Not a problem, just an observation. You should expect such things when staying in the Sandhills! 10/10, really can’t go wrong here."

Stayed with kids","This riverside home was everything we hoped for...and more! It is pretty secluded (which suited us great!), in a beautiful part of Nebraska, surrounded by hills, trees, fields, and wildflowers. We brought our two little guys (3yrs and 1.5yrs) and they had great fun romping in the yard and playing on the front porch. The river is accessible but not so close to the house as to make it worrisome for little people who can't swim. A nice little clearing by the river, surrounded by towering cottonwoods, holds a zipline, swing, and slack line that make for great fun. The house itself is clean and beautiful (""magical"" and ""refreshing"" were two words that kept popping up in our vocabulary while we were there), with a well-thought-out layout and a crisp decorating style that is chic while being very kid-friendly at the same time. We are already talking about coming back! We highly recommend this place and its hosts. Thanks for a great stay, John and Mandy!"

He and Mandy made sure to message us and tell us to have a good visit, to relax and enjoy our time and visit, and also to check and see if we needed anything and that they would help us gather stuff for fire pit and help bring us stuff to start a fire…..I would definitely recommend and highly recommend to friends, family who want to enjoy a quiet, peaceful and secluded getaway or vacation….I hands down would have to say that we were and are blessed with the best hosts ever!

The dock, ir you could pull up with too, just bring some bumpers and tie downs, a cooler so it’s nearby and try your luck fishing at night
Caught three 5 pound catfish and a 17 and a 20 inch walleye
Both back in the lake awaiting another angler.
Nice place for the money especially with a large group."

Stayed a few nights","Stayed to meet family, it was our first time to Nebraska. Julie was a great host, very friendly, flexible allowed us to check in early due to our circumstances. Julie is also very responsive, easy check-in.Place looked exactly like the pictures, extra blankets and plenty of beds, very clean, and right on the lake. Place is safe, and felt very private. Plenty of parking and close to the Walmart and highway if you need to pick up anything. Sliding door views are amazing. Very minor suggestion is have a nonstick pan for eggs for each morning, otherwise pans stick. However kitchen is FULLY stocked, everything you need is there, we had BBQ outdoors. Plenty of space to sit with two living rooms, plenty of bathrooms to get ready, spacious and just a great house all around! Super good location on the lake. Would DEFINITELY recommend this place, don't think twice I've done the research and this is the BEST place on the lake for your value. Would definitely stay again, keeping it as a favorite!"

We had a group of 9 people staying for a wedding and we appreciated the open floor plan of the kitchen, dining area, and living room area; it allowed us to all be in one room and not feel crowded. If you have a number of people in your party, you will appreciate the home having three nice bathrooms. The location of the home also provides easy access to a number of restaurants around the lake and it is not too far if you need to travel to a store."

Very pristine cleanliness and spacious. Very comfortable and up-to-date, modern kitchen, furniture and bathrooms.
Day 2 the toilets wouldn't properly flushed. I messaged Julie and she was on it instantly. That evening while everyone was at the wedding, the toilets were fixed and the AirBnb was back in order for the bride and groom!
I'd highly recommend staying here--I may even do it myself ;)"

Check in was easy, home was clean and well supplied, all appliances were in good shape, wi-fi reliable and kitchen is nicely stocked. The dock is great for swimming and relaxing. Patio is comfortable and lots of chairs and umbrellas. We could find shade all day long and plenty of sun if that's what you want. We didn't watch much TV, but I do know reception is good. I think the fact that we didn't watch much TV speaks highly of the experience. Restaurants on Johnson lake are a lovely example of good local dining. Markets are close enough to keep cooking and last minute needs pretty easy. Julie manages the property very efficiently and process of booking and billing went well. I will definitely return when they have another opening on a weekend!!"

There was plenty beds and bathrooms for us and the best part was the shade we had to get out of the sun and relax!! Great experience we will be going back again. Thank you again Julie❤️"

Stayed with kids",Prime location on the lake and the kitchen is large which is always a plus. However there is not a fire pit and barely any space on the dock or the grass area. Also the dock is not plastic so having our boat docked there ended up scratching and scraping on the side of the boat. We had a great time but with the extra cost per person over 8 guests we will not return.

The place was very clean and nicely decorated, the beds were extremely comfortable, and the kitchen/living/dining area has great lake views and is perfect for entertaining. We'd definitely stay here again!"

The water was beautiful even though the weather was cold and overcast much of our stay, it even snowed! The only thing I would change: Other people’s condiments in refrigerator and cabinets full of spices. We had nowhere to put our food. Every cabinet was full. We had to leave our food out on the counter. Also, we lugged lots of blankets in a crowded car only to find that there are actually blankets there to use.
The house was comfortable and we had a blast! We were in town to watch the sandhill crane migration and it did not disappoint:)"

The lake beckons you early each morning to take in the sunrise and be refreshed and awed by the glimmering water. We love having our boat so accessible at the dock right down from the umbrella covered patio. Meals are easy with the grill and the restaurant across the lake is absolutely delicious, welcoming and delightful! We enjoyed viewing all the birds and were happy to see they are well fed! The Lake House is a perfect get away! The kitchen is stocked with all your needs! Looking forward to making more memories next season! Thanks Julie!"

This is the second time we have rented this place and it looks just the same as the first time we stayed because it is so well cared for!
I choose my Airbnb rentals carefully because I’m pretty picky. Not only does it have to be a great place, but I also appreciate a good Airbnb host and I have to say Julie and her husband are the best I’ve experienced!
We hope to come back again! Thanks so much Julie & Scott!"

Layout of the house with all the bedrooms and bathrooms down the hallway worked well for our group. All we needed to do was bring our clothes. The house had everything we needed. A bonus was that Julie left us coffee for our mornings. Given the time of year we were not able to take advantage of the lake that was steps away but the view from the house was beautiful. Great place great vacation.

Stayed one night","Let me start by saying that I could write a review a dozen pages long for Tom & Cindy’s place. Tom & Cindy (let’s be honest, Cindy) have thought of everything to make you feel like you’re at home. They have clear instructions on everything in the home to make sure there isn’t any questions or confusion. The house is adorable and perfectly decorated. It’s located on a quaint, quiet street within walking distance of a few restaurants and shops. I think the filtered water in the fridge made my husband love Tom & Cindy more than we already did. Clean water is my husband’s love language lol. Plus, we had delicious homemade cinnamon rolls waiting on the counter when we arrived. Again, I could go on for DAYS about this wonderful home and experience. I only wish we had more than 1 night booked with them. Thank you Tom & Cindy for sharing your place with us!"

Really felt a peaceful serenity in their home and appreciate all the extra touches like the honesty jar items and purchasing one of Tom’s beautiful wood creations. They had a ton of amazing toys, books, and board games which were a huge hit with our son. Can’t say enough about this rental and hosts. 🌟"

Stayed a few nights","The storybook cottage is one of the best - perhaps THE best - AirBnB places I've stayed. It's like walking into someone's dream cottage and finding out it's yours for a while. It all seems very new and spiffy. Comfy bed, good shower, great kitchen, open plan living/dining room / kitchen, flat-screen TV on the wall. There is a cute sun porch with a sofa and pull-down desk that was just the right size for my yoga mat. A handy entry area with coat hooks and a bench. The kitchen is well-equipped. The living room couches, the dining room table, and the kitchen counter make it a great spot for families to hang out together. The towels were thick, abundant, and looked new. There's a shower and a bathtub. And, there was even a little Christmas tree! I loved staying here. The cottage is near the library, the Pony Express Museum, a leafy park, and an easy walk to the downtown area of this charming small town."

Being away from home is hard, but this property makes it so much better. I am glad to be done with traveling but I am sad my time in the Cottage is over. Tom and Cindy are the best hosts ever. There were a few mishaps on my part and they were so understanding. The popcorn is magical. The cinnamon rolls are so wonderful. I have a thing for candy and they always have an ample supply for me. The puzzlers are a fun diversion. I solved all of them . . . .by looking them up on the internet. The property is pristine and seems to stay like new. If you treat this place like your home, it will feel more like home. You won’t find a better property on the AirBnB circuit. Cheers."

Mi Rancherito Mexican restaurant down the road was an added bonus. So affordable and delicious!

Stayed with kids","It's hard to know where to begin with this place. Traveling long distances with tiny children is very difficult. There are very few opportunities for the adults to relax. This home, however, helps you feel relaxed right away.
Some toys were laid out, at eye level, for my children. As soon as we entered, they smiled and squealed and rushed right over to play. There were toys and a towel and a stool in the bathroom. My children were clamoring to get into the bath.
The house was so warm and welcoming. There were even homemade cinnamon rolls for us in the freezer and coloring books (with crayons) for my older daughter.
I can't say enough good things. We stopped here during a cross-country trip and might make a special trip to Nebraska again some day, just so we can come back to this home."

Stayed with kids","I don't know exactly how many airbnbs I've stayed in, but it's at least 50, and maybe 70 or 80. And seriously: I don't think I've ever seen a place as flawless as this one. I can't believe the amount of effort Tom and Cindy put into every little detail. It's indescribable.
Honestly, I've never seen anything quite like it. Sure, it's ""just"" a nice, renovated two-bedroom home in a small Nebraska town, but the level of care is mind-blowing. They've thought about HUNDREDS of little details. It's incredible.
I was tempted to put $100 in the snack/drink ""honesty jar"", just because. We were just passing through for a night, but we spent a bunch of time brainstorming excuses to spend a week in Gothenburg, just to stay here again.
I'm running out of superlatives, so I'll stop now. A huge tip of the cap to Tom and Cindy -- I'm an obsessive traveler whose life has been blessed by dozens of incredible hosts, but these two are at the top of the list."

The rooms are more spacious than they appear in the photos and the house is perfectly outfitted with everything you will need. It's in a quiet location and the neighbors are extremely friendly. We came to watch the sandhill cranes and while we had to drive a bit to the viewing locations, Gothenburg is perfectly situated for easy access to North Platte and Kearney. In fact, it was better staying in a quiet town with downhome appeal than going to a more generic larger town. Tom and Cindy did an excellent job of welcoming us and communicating clearly about the rules, amenities, etc. I also believe it would be a nice place to bring kids as the streets are very quiet and there a couple of nearby parks. I recommend the Storybook Cottage without reservation!!"

Stayed with a pet","Although I only stayed one night, as this was part of a week long road trip with my dog, we both appreciated the space. As soon as I walked in I felt at ease. I loved the open living/dining area, my dog enjoyed the fenced in yard which was larger than I expected. The hosts even had poop bags by the back door. Having access to a washer and dryer in the middle of my trip came in handy, and the kitchen was perfect for a home cooked meal on the road. It was located close to a grocery store and several parks, we took advantage of the Lake Helen Recreation Area, once on arrival just as the sun was setting, and then again in the morning before we got on the road. Check in and check out were easy and the hosts were easy to communicate with."

Stayed a few nights","This is an older home near a railroad track. Perfect space for family and friends to sit and visit. You can set up a snack buffet on the cute pull up sideboard/buffet in the dining area. There are games galore to play in that sideboard/buffet also. I really wanted to play Hedbanz, yet we were there for a funeral so really did not have time for that and no children under forty were with us. All you need to prepare and serve a meal. Being older and a little challenged in the 'Airbnb App' check-in process (the fewer Apps the better for me) we did need a little help from Hosts to get inside. Easy enough since their phone numbers are on the site where I found the airbnb. I would book this again."

Stayed with a pet",Day 2 of a road trip from LA to Chicago and this was a perfect stop. It was a great house in a quiet neighborhood. It was nice to have access to a backyard for my dog to wander a bit after spending a day in the car. Felt at home and it was a great reset before hitting the road again. Would come back again next time I make the drive home.

Stayed with a pet","Tony and Hayley’s place was perfect for what we needed - a quick stop on our way across I-80 for us and our two fur babies. The hosts were very communicative and provided all the necessary information. The fenced in backyard was perfect for our pup to let some energy out after a long drive, and all pet necessities were provided, including poop bags and even treats for both our dog and kitty cat! The keurig was amazing to have in the morning since we left around 6am and no coffee places were open yet. Oh and it was so nice to not have any check out chores!!! Hosts made our stay so easy and relaxing :)"

Kitchen was well equipped so that we were able to cook our dinner once we arrived. Close to the small downtown area, so we were able to walk to the coffee shop in the morning before heading out."

Stayed with a pet","Tony and Hayley's place is awesome, especially if traveling with dogs! They have a very nice fenced yard and pups got some zoomies in during travel. They have thought of several details including poop bags and treats on counter.
The house is very peaceful and relaxing. It is quite close to a large plant or something. When outside, there is a low hum/noise, but did not scare my dogs. Inside, you cannot hear it.
Furniture and bedding are all very clean and comfortable. We tend to use kitchen a bit and it was very clean with all we needed. A working full size fridge and freezer.
Super cute coffee shop near interstate, Lasso Coffee, that has alternative milks and decaf espresso! Often hard to find in middle America.
A really great stay, I just wish we had more time to enjoy the space and the town. Arrival was much later than expected and were on road by 10.
Overall a fantastic place to stay, especially with fur babies!!"

My pets usually bark some when at a new place and constantly fidgety, but this place made them comfortable and quiet.
I would recommend their place 💯 and would love to stay there again if needed.
You will not be disappointed!!!!!"

The home was extremely clean, and not cluttered like some airbnbs. We were only really there to sleep, but would definitely have used the kitchen and living room if we had time. Everything was clean and comfortable.
The hosts were also fantastic! Super responsive and very kind, but what else could you expect from other dog lovers :)
Would highly recommend!"

It’s worth noting that the attention to detail was immaculate! To the bathroom amenities all the way down to the various pots and plans in the kitchen- it made settling in so nice

We would certainly stay at Tony and Hayley’s again if we are back in the area. Be sure to stop at the Pony Express Station in the downtown park.

Stayed with a pet","We loved this stay. It’s definitely in our top three.
We would stay in any home Tony and Hayley manage. Their thoughtful attention to detail is obvious.
My 95 y/o mother could move easily through each room with her walker (minus the bathroom - but she had everything she needed within reach and didn’t need her walker there).
Every room is super clean and well stocked with nice dishes, pots and pans, bedding, and towels.
This well appointed older home is lovely with high ceilings and minimal decor. We also had plenty of space to bring in our coolers and luggage.
This home is just what we always hope for when scheduling a stay through Airbnb."

Stayed with a pet","As someone who has stayed at this Airbnb rental in the middle of Nebraska, I can say with confidence that it is an exceptional place to stay. The hosts are incredibly warm, and went out of their way late at night to make sure that I felt comfortable during my stay.
The house itself is truly a delight, with a cozy and inviting atmosphere that makes it the perfect place to relax and unwind. The beds are comfortable, the kitchen is fully equipped, and the living area is spacious and comfortable. I especially loved the charming 1930's decor and rustic touches that really capture the essence of the Nebraska countryside.
The location of this rental is also second to none. Surrounded by stunning natural beauty and some of the most picturesque landscapes that the state offers, it's the perfect place to escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life and immerse yourself in the tranquility of the great outdoors.
They say Nebraska isn't for everyone, but I think it is now for me."

Tricia's Airbnb was a perfect location for both fun activities! From the get-go Tricia responded to my email questions promptly. The Airbnb was clean, very comfortable, and was located about 7 miles outside downtown Kearney so it was wonderfully quiet. Tricia told me in advance that there were about 3 miles of unpaved road leading to her neighborhood so we were prepared for that. There were flyers in the living room re: the Sand Hill Crane migration, local things to see and do which were helpful. The major migration viewing spots and good restaurants were all within 10 miles of the Airbnb! Unfortunately, I got sick one of the nights we were there. Tricia handled the situation very kindly and fairly. SO grateful there was a stack washer/dryer in the bathroom! Treat yourself and stay at Tricia's place! You'll be glad you did!"

Stayed a few nights","The Roost was absolutely wonderful! Very spacious, clean, and nicely decorated. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook meals, including essential condiments. It was well stocked, lots of towels in bathroom and kitchen, lots of coffee and tea options, plenty of blankets. Tricia was quick to respond and honored a couple requests that I had, very accomodating! Highly recommend!"

I love the historic town of Kearney. Several cute stores and fun restaurants. Of course, the CRANES are just an added bonus! Property is 45 min. from Crane Trust and 35 minutes from Rowe Sanctuary. The park in town would be absolutely lovely during the summer. Bring bikes! Very bike friendly town with lots of trails near the Archway Museum (also a wonderful place to visit) I will definitely be back during warmer weather. I bet the stars are amazing from the property. We had to extend our stay due to incoming bad weather. She helped me with the process and was very kind and gracious to us during our stay. Look no further. This place is wonderful for visiting Kearney and all it has to offer."

Stayed with a pet","Ok first of all it was pouring down rain! Dark and hard to see. Nobody's fault but made it hard to find.
Karen's place is comfortable. The space was welcoming, the shower nice, and the bed ok. KriKet, our fur-daughter, loved the pet friendly atmosphere!
The surroundings appeared discoverable... I guess? And another time we might enjoying spending more time. We were hauling antiques cross country so not a lot of time to dally. It seemed _way_ off I80 and take food because (and maybe it was because of the horrible storm, but) no food. Nothing at all to eat.
The stay was worth the money, though. If you're on a budget, it's perfect."

Karen’s place was cozy and just what I needed and the price is right! If you’re planning to arrive late (like I did) the best sure to get food off the highway. Places close early and are very limited. It’s an old house but clean and comfortable.

The bed was very comfortable and the linens smelled lovely. The extra little amenities were a really nice touch. Thoughtful.
I love that she is a 5th gen farmer/rancher! And branching out with new opportunities. Yessss Karen! ❤️
We arrived late and my gps didn’t take us to the house, Karen returned my call immediately and talked me through it.
As for the “bugs” a guest commented on….goodness gracious. Different seasons and different states bring different critters. I saw one on my stay. And, it’s a bug. I hope this doesn’t keep you from a good little spot with an amazing host."

Stayed with a pet","Booked (2/26) same-day, traveling thru NE. Location worked & ratings seemed good. Arrived 9pm-ish. A bit later, found live bugs near & then dead bugs behind couch. I messaged Karen checkout day (2/27) & mentioned the bugs in a friendly, respectful way & gave her the benefit of the doubt as a newer listing/host. The app showed she read my message- but no reply.
9 days later, still no reply, so I msgd her again, w/pics. (Upon closer look, reviews show other incidents.) Karen finally replied (3/8) & apologized for the bugs. But also wrote paragraphs of negative comments—deflecting the real issue -with false & insulting claims about us as guests. And, boasted about herself & listing. Made 0 attempt to resolve.
What could’ve been solved easily w/ a prompt reply, apology & small effort, turned into a big headache for me. Thankfully Abnb Support resolved the issue. Due to Karen’s choice to ignore the issue & then 10+ days later, respond negatively & defensively, I would not recommend."

Stayed with a pet","Was really taken aback by the number of bugs -both dead and alive- in every room. If this isn’t able to be managed or controlled better, it really should be stated in the listing. The fridge was also filthy inside, and when I went to grab a bowl to give my dog water, it was visibly dirty. I’m a side sleeper and didn’t find the bed comfortable at all; I was up more than once with pain in my hips. Had I been staying more than one night, I would have asked for cleaning, but I arrived after midnight and it wasn’t worth it.
I did appreciate that Karen allows dogs and quickly agreed to checking out an hour late. While Karen was kind and checked in, each time she did so she mentioned a five-star rating which made me feel that she valued that over important my actual comfort.
It’s a just-ok place to crash for a night but wouldn’t recommend it for longer than that."

Stayed with a pet","Karen, I HAVE to leave you a review... You are an amazing human being! Long story short, i was traveling home pulling a horse trailer. Absolutely exhausted. Made a last minute reservation, so excited for a bed and a chance to rest. Karen made arrangements for my horse and where i could park my rig. Everything was set. An hour from Eustis, my wheel bearing took it's last breath/turn. I'm dead in the water. Karen went completely out of her way in reimbursing my last minute stay, contacted a friend who recommended a mechanic. She was so willing to help where she could and make sure my animals and I were good.
So, thank you, from the bottom of my heart! I pray God blesses you in return for you blessing me, even tho i didn't get to stay in your lovely home there. ❤️😉"

The house was adorable and clean, linens were fresh, and the beds were super comfortable. She left a frozen pizza in the freezer and a sweet note saying that since we were coming in late she wanted to make sure we had food in case we hadn't eaten.
We were the first people to stay here, so the house is still being worked on, but even with that it's stay ready.
Definitely wouldn't hesitate to stay here again or recommend to friends and family. Country hospitality at its finest."
