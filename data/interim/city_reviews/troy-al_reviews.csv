Stayed a few nights","We found The Whatley House to be exactly as described. The interior was modern, efficient, and clean. Everything inside and out is well maintained. Our host responded almost instantly to any questions we had. We were attending a family wedding in Troy and felt this would be a great place for the four of us to stay, and boy, were we right! There was even a friendly horse next door that took to us right away, what a bonus! I highly recommend The Whately House and its gracious owner and host!"

Stayed a few nights",We came up to visit our grandchildren and have family time. The house was perfect. We’re enjoyed the pool take but most of all the beautiful porch sitting and horse petting we got to do. There’s nothing better but getting up and sitting in the porch and watching the horses same to be said for the sunsets. There was plenty of room for everyone to have their space and we had a nice family dinner with plenty of room for everyone. It’s great there’s spring in the kitchen and two dining room tables. Whenever I had a question Brenda responded immediately. I also had the pleasure of meeting her and her husband and coincidentally her daughter. I’d you’re looking for a spacious house in the country with great views- this is a great one!

Stayed about a week","Brenda is an excellent host. If you're looking for more of a rural setting, this is the place to go. The drive out to the house on the county roads is a nice drive. It's quiet, peaceful, and I had everything I needed during my stay. Sitting on the front porch in a rocker with a book is a great way to spend a lazy day. The pool table is good entertainment with a few friends. The house is spacious and not crowded, clean, and comfortable. The soaking tub was a highlight for relaxation. Brenda was helpful and responded readily. I will definitely be booking her place the next time I'm in the area!"

It was perfect! So quiet and cozy. We felt right at home. Our horse friends came to visit each morning and we enjoyed a steak off the grill and relaxed on the porch a bit. We will definitely be back.

Stayed a few nights","We didn’t get there until after 8 PM. When we got there, the house was nicely lit up with lights. that was a true plus we were saddened to know. that the air conditioner wasn’t working. there was a nice note on the counter. with Brenda‘s telephone number on it I told my family that I would call her first thing in the morning and I did. she answered and said that she would get somebody over right away. We have plans to leave town to visit family that whole day. by the time I got to our families house she had already left a text and told me that it was fixed when we arrive back to Brenda‘s house that evening the house was nice and cool down to 72° boy where we thankful all the hospitality accommodations were so great washing powder breakfast snacks, DVDs just to name a few if I’m ever in that area again she’ll be the first person I contact for stay. Signed a happy customer Angela Johnson ."

Stayed a few nights","I came to Troy to attend a bridal shower and The Outback was so beautiful and peaceful, I booked another of their properties to attend the wedding in 2 months. Billie does not miss a single detail for her guests. The amenities were plentiful and varied, the bed was luxurious, the bathroom was unique and exceptionally clean, the kitchen is well-stocked with higher end dishes and glassware. I cannot get over how much this property made me feel like I was in a high-end resort. If you stay in or around Troy, AL and stay anywhere other than one of Billie's properties, you are doing yourself a disservice! Five stars is simply not enough."

Stayed a few nights","The location to the university is very good. If you walk well, you can even walk. We were there for the 2nd time and we were completely thrilled again.
This time we also used the washing machine and dryers. There is also an iron and iron board.
There is also some food (snacks, frozen goods, drinks and coffee) provided by the landlord in the beginning, so you don't have to do a shopping right away if you are flexible.
We lacked nothing and on the terrace in front of the apartment you can sit nicely and if you want to grill (there is a barbecue, which we did not use). However, we also had a small gas fireplace, which created a nice cozy atmosphere in the evening.
Parking is free directly at the apartment.
There is also a very similarly equipped but bright designer apartment from the same landlord right next door, which is also very nice.
We will be happy to come back!"

The location was right in the middle of everything and that made getting places very easy and quick. The snacks were a very nice touch which were greatly appreciated. There was even breakfast items in the fridge though i did not get the chance to partake as I was constantly on the move. My only complaint and not to cast a shadow on this amazing place was that for me the bed was a little firm (for my taste) but dont let that stop you from coming to this amazing establishment. It is well worth a trip."

Host-provided coffee and snacks were a big plus, bed was very comfortable, place was charming. This place is not for parties or louder groups but that was perfect for us. Host was crystal clear on expectations. We would stay here again without hesitation."

I purchased ear plugs because i could hear everything above me in the real estate office. Otherwise great accommodations. I was offered an opportunity to leave by the host but the area has little to offer during football season. No place to go, hotels are even booked."

Stayed a few nights","This is by far THE BEST Airbnb! The small details create such a big impact of the appreciation the Flowers have for their rental. From the time you pull into the parking area and see the well cared for plants, seating with a gas fire pit, and the grilling area, you know you can enjoy your trip by just staying ""at your new home.""
Upon unlocking the door, the cleanliness will be the first eye opening experience. Walls, lightning, furniture, and the kitchen are immaculate. When putting your bags down you will make your way into the kitchen area where numerous breakfast items, chips, nuts, and crackers have been left for you to enjoy.
When packing the fridge, you will be pleasantly surprised to see waters and soft drinks waiting for you to enjoy. In addition, a quick bite meal that can be prepared in the microwave is awaiting in the freezer and a wide variety of coffees, cocoas, and hot teas can be brewed in the Keurig.
A formal ""Hello"" left in a note asking you to mark your home city on the push pin map is a great conversation piece to see where all past visitors have traveled from.
The bathroom is just precious! The galvanized bucket for the sink, watering can shower, and wooden barn door is such a great utilization of keeping the home's theme running throughout the space. Let me add how wonderful the toiletry items were. They were top notch in getting you clean, pleasant smell, and so refreshing to the hair and skin.....NOT DRYING at all! I would LOVE to find full-size products in this brand!
The bedroom is so comfy! The bed is massive and the mattress is WONDERFUL.....""not too soft and not too hard.....it is JUST Right!""
I wish ALL Airbnb owners were required to visit this little slice of heaven in Troy, Alabama before listing their properties. IT IS like no other Airbnb I have stayed in before.....Great job Flower's family for creating a wonderful out of town experience with such clean and inviting accommodations."

Stayed one night","The “Outback” was sparkling clean. We absolutely loved the theme and the decor. At the time of booking, we just happened mention it was our Wedding Anniversary weekend. Prior to our arrival, Billie had elegantly arranged fresh strawberries, chocolate kisses, cheese cubes, crackers, and a bottled beverage on the marble topped island. Not to mention, the full kitchen was stocked with an assortment of snacks, fresh fruit, and bottled water in the fridge. The location is perfect! You are just minutes away from the main attractions in Troy, or also a great place for you and yours to stay the night and recharge before getting back on the road, whether heading to and from your favorite vacation location or business trip. This will definitely not be our last time staying at one of Billie’s properties. I loved the rustic theme of the “Outback”, but my wife has already been eyeing “On Madison” which adjoins “Outback” and looks to have a modern chic type theme. If interested don’t hesitate to message or call Billie, she was a great host and treated us like family."

Connies place was great, well maintained and very clean. You don't have to be there to watch your daughter graduate tho.

The 1.5 baths was a very nice extra. The back porch and courtyard was a perfect way to unwind in the evening.
It is close to the train tracks but the train really didn’t bother us. It actually made us laugh."

Easy walk to restaurants and THE BSWEET bakery. Really appreciated all the extra attention to detail. My husband is a CAR GUY so he was pleased with the decor. His uncle owned a service station very similar to THE STATION from the 40s to 70s, this was a great pick for him. As bathrooms in renovated structures tend to be small, we think a great choice was made having a second half bath."

The outside firetable area was great on our chilly night that we stayed. You can walk to Sips to eat and it will not dissappoint!! If you are visiting your kid at Troy like we were stay here!

Our pups loved being able to run around in the fenced in patio area as well. The 2 bathrooms made it easy for two people to get ready for the day. The repurposing of the old gas station was really cute and a joy to experience."

Stayed a few nights","I love Megan and Kyle. I cannot thank them enough for rhe perfect home away from home. Went down for my son's college graduation. They let me feel like a mom again when I was allowed to have him over and cook dinner. The place itself could not have been better. No expense was spared by them. I got to play with their animals. we had a really bad storm and they checked on me in the morning to know I was safe and sound. I have stayed in hotels in Troy before and as long as this cottage is available I will never use a hotel there again. I would pay double.
I can only hope I will be welcome. I miss the cottage and I have been gone almost 8 hours.
If Megan and Kyle are ever in Dover DE and not stop to say hi, I will be sad.
Love you guys!!!

Property was very clean.
Watching chickens/ducks/Guineas and dogs was a great extra for us, sitting on the front porch.

Stayed a few nights","Megan and Kyle have a beautiful mini farm setting. The Airbnb is on the property, yet private, quiet and located a good distance from the owners quarters. The place has a front porch with rocking chairs which we enjoyed. The carport was a nice feature as it rained during our stay. The Airbnb is a solid building and well insulated. We didn’t hear any road noise from inside the Airbnb. They have added many little touches that make the place homey and well equipped. They even provided fresh eggs. The furnishings are very comfortable. The kitchen was well provisioned. Towels, soaps, coffee, etc were provided. We somehow managed to leave an item at the Airbnb and they went to great lengths to help us locate the item. Throughout our stay they were extremely responsive and helpful if we had any questions. We were in the area to attend the Troy SBC Championship game (Go Trojans!). The location is convenient to Troy. We will stay here next year when we return to football games."

The kitchen had all the items needed for preparing all our meals, even port glassware. The bedrooms had microwave/mini fridge/coffee maker/cups/bottles of water and honey buns. The beds were comfortable. The bathrooms were fully stocked with towels and toiletries. The pond to the rear of the property was nice, as well as the lake across the street. We had one issue with the air upstairs but Michelle responded right away, and it was freezing cold upstairs in no time. A suggestion would be to get a new net for the basket ball goal and a new ball, as the ball was flat; or inflat the ones there.. Not a big deal , we went out and bought a basketball. We had a great time and are looking forward to going back."

The house was perfect for our group, and actually exceeded expectations (exa - because of the makeup of our group, we needed 2 air mattresses, and had planned to bring one of our own, since we thought there was only one there. Finding a second one, complete with all its bedding, was a wonderful surprise.)009
The multiple coffee makers, water bottles, and little snacks were a great touch - especially appreciated by my grandchildren.
Our only regret was that we weren't actually at the house for much time other than sleeping, so we couldn't fully use the lovely sitting and eating areas. And the weather wasn't particularly nice, so we couldn't really enjoy the lovely porch.
If we find ourselves in need of a place to stay in the Troy area again, we will definitely rebook this home."

Cute, homey, and very clean with all the necessities available.
There were many amenities that we did not stay long enough to take advantage of but would be great for a longer stay, especially for kids/game-lovers and/or a baby.
Would not hesitate to book again on another trip.
And... Britt is a Great Host! 🤗"

Stayed a few nights","We loved this spot!!! Plenty of restaurants and a Publix the next street over. It is close to a major highway so if you are a light sleeper bring a white noise machine!!! Those semis can be loud. But the location was perfect for our needs. Close to the university too. We loved the house if we ever buy one we want it just like this one! Clean and spacious, new and old, it was just right! We did have a small issue with a broken window in the house, but when we reached out a 9pm Britt and her husband were quick to jump up and come board it up. Nothing happened while we were there we were safe just a fix didn’t stay fixed. They are replacing the window it’s just on order. Like everything in this economy. Anyways, in no way did it effect our stay or our confidence in our host. When we come back we will be staying here again!!!! Thank you so much for the hospitality and the use of your home."

Stayed a few nights","This was the perfect place to stay while visiting the University. It was within 5 minutes drive and also close to restaurants and stores. The only downside to that is that you could hear quite a bit of traffic noise.
The covered carport adjacent to the side door was great for loading and unloading especially in the rain. The game room was an added bonus I’m not sure I realized was there but we definitely used it. Both beds were super comfortable and everyone slept very well. There was plenty of bedding and we even found cozy throws in closets to use while watching TV. The nursery bedroom was the cutest! We didn’t have a baby but I used it as a dressing room just so I could spend time in there.
This IS an old house (which we happen to love) so don’t expect perfection. Britt has done a great job making it a cozy, comfortable, sweet-smelling space without making it “brand new”.
We would definitely stay here again."

Stayed with a pet","Back with another review for “Farmcharm”! I obviously love this little loft. I’ve stayed here multiple times for work trips with my two pups.
The new mattress is wonderful and very comfortable, working nights and an atypical sleep cycle is challenging enough, the new mattress definitely enhanced my sleep.
Things I haven’t mentioned in previous reviews… the furnishings are so unique, I recently learned Dawn is super talented and has created the look of most of the pieces herself.
The hot water in the shower is just divine! I’m just an average female that lives for boiling hot showers and this surpasses expectations.
#1 pick for Troy and surrounding areas!"

Instructions were clear, they were proactive with accommodations, and always responsive before, during, and after our stay.
The loft itself is gorgeous and impeccably clean. The property is on a lot of land, which my two larger four legged friends very much enjoy :)

Stayed one night","I will definitely check their availability first the next time I’m visiting Troy. It was just a very short country drive from town (8-10 min). I arrived to find the cleanest Airbnb I’ve stayed in so far. It is evident they take pride in their property and care for their guests. Everything was CLEAN and TIDY - no gritty floor, no dust on the furniture, no cobwebs in obscure places, no surprise dust bunnies floating out. Y’all even the baseboards were clean!! I didn’t feel like I had to get out my Clorox disinfecting wipes at all, so I didn’t. And I even walked around barefoot! I mean I NEVER do that when traveling! Thanks so much for a comfortable place to stay and I hope that this was just one of many visits to come."

It was apparent that they put a lot of thought and care when creating the spatial rooms. We felt like we were at a farmhouse spa. This is, by far, our favorite Airbnb. They took care of us in so many ways~ even messaged us regarding a weather front. Such a kind couple. Beyond fast response time though it was something we left, nothing on their end. We stayed with them on our way back from the Keys & Ft Myers and staying at their Airbnb was a vacation, in itself. Beautiful scenery, as well. We’ll be back!"

They have thought of every detail in furnishings and finishings in the loft and bathroom. The decor was nice, and the room and bathroom had plenty of space. There were ample supply of things you might expect to see in a hotel, like coffee pods and toiletries, and a few things you wouldn't get in a hotel like a few bottled waters in the fridge and some things to read. The setting is rural, and so the quiet of the country is very conducive to resting and relaxing, and you can close the curtains for privacy or open them wide and enjoy the view of nature. Their communication is excellent, and that made checking in and out simple and efficient."

My husband and I, along with our dog Shiloh, had enough room during our stay. We loved the setting of the Farm Charm and enjoyed exploring the town of Troy along with the surrounding towns. The space is perfect to relax and unwind from a busy life. The bed is very comfortable and the Airbnb was very clean. Rob and Dawn are very gracious host and want to make sure that you are comfortable during your stay. You will not be disappointed with your stay."

The unit is brand new, beautifully furnished and decorated and immaculate. The bed is very comfortable, the linens plush, and the bathroom beautiful and well appointed. Check-in was a breeze and communication with the hosts was easy, with quick response time. The hosts are wonderful people it was our pleasure to meet. We will stay here any time possible when we visit Troy."

I could live in it long term! Very clean, as stocked as a studio can be, and it looks like something out of a magazine. Their rural neighborhood is quiet, and it was so lovely to fall asleep to the sound of frogs at night. Fuse coffee downtown a few miles away was delicious. Dawn n Rob are great at answering any questions promptly, and you can tell they opened up their home for the love of travel — Would love to stay again. Thanks y’all!"

We contacted Rob early afternoon to see if we might be able to stay one night on the way to our destination. And to add to it, we'd be arriving late at night. Rob was very accommodating. Communication was top notch. I guess GPS doesn't always get you to his house and so he nicely explained step-by-step how to get there. The place was spotless. Directions to access it were very clear. Very cute, private above the garage apartment. And they even had an airbed set up for our daughter. Nice coffee bar, fridge, toaster, and microwave. Adorable vanity in the bathroom. Bed was super comfy. It was just what we needed after a long day on the road! Would stay again in a minute!"

Stayed a few nights","I can't say enough wonderful things about this place! I would be quick to tell you that if you want to be walking distance from anything, this isn't your place. But! that's WHY it was perfect!! It was incredibly peaceful, the birds were so happy, the geese honking by, the distant lowing of cattle, the very occasional pickup driving by with a friendly wave, it was perfectly remote but super easy to get to.
She had great recommendations for Fuse coffee shop (Jack is the sweetest and the coffee isn't bad!), and some local diners. I would HIGHLY recommend the public library, it's one of the best I've ever seen. The genealogy room was fascinating!
I LOVED the coffee bar, plenty of decaf and regular selections. The cold drinks were fun sized and perfect for a little treat (I never drink sodas). The porch was perfection. I was able to sit and listen to the rain storm roll in.
Sleep was relaxing and cozy in bed. Penny did a fabulous job decorating and choosing relaxing colors that flowed."

There are only AC window units in the living room and first bedroom (which are on the same end of the house). So the bathroom and second bedroom were quite hot. The kitchen counters were covered in a sticky, dingy film. There were ants in the bedroom. We came in on some very rough, dirt roads with pretty scary surroundings. So some directional advice in the listing would be good. Lots of snacks and coffee provided which was great."

I think she likes to spoil people!! Great snacks and just about every thing we could possibly want were waiting when we got there- including the fixings for making s'mores. We didn't get to the s'mores though. We were in town to root for our Grandson's baseball team in the All-Star Games. Making s'mores after being in the Alabama heat all afternoon didn't seem like fun to either of us. So grateful for the AC and Roku!!
Watching Humming birds fluttering around, hearing quail calling out, and seeing a pair of deer wandering out of the trees while we sat on the porch are among the little things that have made our short stay here a memorable one! Hope to be back again someday."

Stayed a few nights","This was actually our second stay to this property. The first time our family booked our stay here and when we planned to come back to the area, i knew i wanted to stay back at this location. To say that this Airbnb is comfortable is an understatement… plenty of room to kick up your feet and truly relax. Note this is close to the train tracks so if that bothers you, you might choose a home away from them but it doesn’t bother us. This property is a converted warehouse that allows 6 to move around very comfortably within a wide open space (minus the bedrooms which are very spacious). All in all, you will not be disappointed… very easy to find, access and just enjoy!"

I loved reading the history of the building and having the garage to park in. Our son loved the swing chair and stayed in it most of the time. The barn door chalkboard was an added treat we used to list aspirations for the upcoming year. We were so happy with the location, we brought 2 of my sisters over to tour it and they were impressed as well and plan to tell others about it. Upon our return from walking around the town square, we ran into Lyndsay and her husband who were super welcoming and friendly. They spent time chatting with us even though we could clearly see they were busy setting up Christmas decorations. Overall, we were pleased and will definitely return!"

The building is an old warehouse which appears to be renovated and they even added a garage. It’s rustic, but with modern amenities, and the lighting felt relaxing. Lots of raw finishes gave a very peaceful vibe. The bed was very comfortable. Bathrooms were spotless and the showers were a nice bonus. All in all, if you are ever in the Troy area, you must check this place out. 10/10 would recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","Lyndsay was a great host, so nice and friendly. She made our stay feel right at home. The Warehouse is such a cool little spot, definitely a hidden gem. My teenage daughter & I were in town for a Troy basketball game so the location was ideal. Close enough to campus without being on campus. This was a stop on our way back to taking her to college and back to school shopping was super convenient from this location. The downtown square was in walking distance which was cool and the Italian dinner Lyndsay recommended at Francesca’s was great. The coolest place though had to be Sips next door which was probably just a couple hundred steps away. We got to enjoy a beautiful day sitting in the sun eating pizza & macaroni and cheese bites, but the pink lemonade sour (one of the many craft beers/seltzers on tap) was by far my favorite."

The location to the square is perfect, the size of the warehouse is super roomy, and the communication with the owner was flawless. We also walked over to Sips to try a cold beer on tap & indulge in the BEST pizza! The atmosphere of the market lights, corn hole and fire pits were so inviting that we had to stop in.

Group trip","Lyndsay!
We so enjoyed our stay!! I wanted to support local and have more personal experience during our reunion, and the Warehouse is all that and more!! I love that you have maintained the history of the building, the exposed brick and exposed ceiling, all while creating a modern and intimate setting. It was the perfect space for gathering and fellowship. Did I mention the showers? Oy!! We all want to update ours! Also, the proximity to downtown is perfect as well as having Sips just behind us! Already looking at dates to reserve again!!! You are an amazing hostess and I look forward to my next stay!!!"

Group trip","The location was exactly as described per the pictures. Would definitely stay again. A few comments: I would have liked a little more secure front door, if someone wanted to break in the door definitely would not be a barrier. And I personally would have liked a TV in the bedrooms as there is next to nothing to do in the area and would have liked to be able to close my door and relax with a movie. I did love the transformation of the warehouse and would stay again anytime."

Stayed one night","This place was a welcome retreat to an exhausting road trip. Our car broke down as we were passing through Troy and we had to get towed to a mechanic who wouldn't have the parts ready till the next day.
This location happened to be a few blocks away, and thankfully Lyndsay is VERY quick to respond. She got back to us within minutes and we had a place to go to on short notice. And what a beautiful place. An old peanut factory, renovated with several large rooms, huge bathrooms, an inviting open living space to relax with large windows letting in tons of light. It turned what was a terrible morning into a relaxing retreat for the night.
My only regrets are not having more time to stay there."

Had an issue with the wi-fi connection and contacted the host via messenger. But I didn't get a response. I had to use my hotspot for connection to watch any tv. Never could get the front room TV to come on. This was very frustrating because I kept trying the password but NO INTERNET.
And finally the only thing I would suggest about the bathroom is that it needs a higher toilet for older or handicapped people.
But overall a very Nice and Clean place and I enjoyed my stay. I recommend this location."

Luxury linens and beds, a fully stocked kitchen, immaculately clean, large space (2 king on suites) and a half bath. Beautifully decorated and the huge island in the kitchen is amazing with plenty of seating. The host even went the extra mile and left us a small welcome gift. Highly recommend this property to anyone needing accommodations in or around Troy, you will not be disappointed."
