The internet shut off on me twice during the stay briefly and ran quite slow. There weren’t any bowls or laundry detergent/dryer sheets for the washer/dryer but the machines worked well.
He was very strict about the checkout time. Asked for a late checkout and was told it would be $50 per hour.
Nice layout, clean place. In the town of Westminster on the east side."

The place itself was wonderful our dog, Benji, absolutely loved the yard it made Benji's vacation just as enjoyable as ours.
We are so thankful for Theresa and Peter's hospitality. They went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed for a comfortable and relaxing stay. We would highly recommend staying with them to anyone looking for a wonderful Airbnb experience."

Stayed with a pet",My wife and I took our dogs to Vegas instead of paying the exorbitant boarding fees we usually do. We could not have been happier with our overall stay. The guest house was a private oasis nestled in a beautiful natured filled corner of Las Vegas. The dogs had their own yard to run around and play in and they loved the dog run they had access to. We felt like it was our own house! The place was extremely clean and comfortable. Theresa was super on top of things and made sure we felt right at home. I highly recommend this retreat for your next trip to Vegas and we will definitely be back.

Stayed with a pet","Theresa is very friendly and responded to a question I asked when I booked right away. She was so kind to remove air fresheners for me due to allergies and she even re-washed the bedding she said to help. That said, if you are really sensitive to scents-there was a little scent left. It’s a nice, clean scent, not the cheap, cover up other odors, air-freshener smell at all. I just have really (stupid) sensitive allergies. They accept pets but this place is pristine with ZERO pet scent or even evidence inside. The furniture is clean and in good condition. I’m sharing the things important to me, but it’s an easy, comfortable, cute space. Convenient. They have nice trees and you can hear the birds in the morning. It’s close to the main house but felt private as we came and went. There was a basket with water and little things, very welcoming."

Location was in a quiet and safe neighborhood.
Their place had everything that we needed for our stay. Theresa and Peter always responded quickly and were very accommodating. Our flight was delayed and we ended up getting there is the middle of the night - they put the lights on for us so we didn't have to fumble around in the dark! They offered some flexibility on checkout if we needed it. We would totally rebook again! Thanks for everything!"

Very quiet - I didn't even hear traffic or anything and had a great sleep. The Shower and Mattress were great - I had a wonderful sleep. The yard was fenced in and large enough for my Mastiff and Weimaraner to run around and get their friskiness out. I would def stay again.

We enjoyed our stay very much and Theresa and Peter were so helpful and kind. After we left, I thought I had left my wedding rings on a shelf in the bedroom, and they immediately went and searched for them. I eventually found them in my luggage so it was a false alarm, but I was concerned and they responded right away and were eager to help. Highly recommend this spot to anyone with dogs or just anyone who wants to stay outside of the strip."

The house was roomy, comfy, clean and quiet and a mere hop skip and a jump from everything we needed or wanted. Thanks for a great stay!"

Stayed one night","We only stayed one night at Theresa’s guest house but it was perfect! Super clean, comfy bed, amazing bathroom/shower! We had camped at Zion before heading back to Vegas for our flight the next day and this place was perfect for us to recharge our batteries. 20 min into the Vegas. 30 min to the airport. Away from the hustle and bustle but a very quick drive to all that Vegas has has to offer! Many amenities/restaurants nearby as well. Loved seeing the cute hawk in the backyard and their pups too! The hawk is just hanging out and doesn’t bother their dogs. Will be back if we visit Vegas again for sure!!"

Spacious, extremely clean, comfortable, quiet, and private, with the incredible convenience of being completely accessible (e.g. no stairs of any kind). We were traveling with a senior dog who's been having trouble getting up and down stairs, so this plus the adjacent dog run right next to the house made things very easy.

Artem's place is a haven for families. With four bedrooms, 2.5 bathrooms, and thoughtful amenities like a highchair and pack n play, it's perfectly set up for a comfortable stay with little ones. Even though I didn't need it this time, the fact that they have an EV charger installed is a great plus – it's fantastic to know that option is available for future visits.
The neighborhood... It's peaceful, safe, and offers a sense of tranquility amidst the Vegas hustle. And let's talk about the backyard – it's huge and offers plenty of privacy. My grandson was in heaven, spending every possible moment outside, exploring and playing. The only thing that stopped him was the rain that started Saturday morning – otherwise, he'd have been out there every waking hour."

We had zero problems getting Ubers to or from the house. I give him five stars. The only critique is that there were not enough wine glasses for a house that sleeps so many. There were only 3 Wine Glasses for our party of 6. I am sure that will be rectified by Artem. If that is my only critique then things were really good!! I would stay there again when I go back to Vegas.

It was spotless and the amenities were excellent. My favorite is that they actually had something to watch on TV. I get tired of spending a lot of money for a place and I have to login to my own account to watch anything on TV. What a nice change.

Stayed a few nights","Beautiful home. Not the best experience with the owner. The grill did not have enough propane in the tank to use. There is no ev charging in the garage which I specifically booked the home for that reason, which caused me to loose time charging my vehicle. Owner also expected me to take prior guest trash out. The trash bin was filled to the top upon arrival, but I was not aware until myself and my guest left since we did not use much trash. Owner also did not disclose charges per guest and harassed me about multiple beds in the home being used. Owner also told me not to write a review if I'm not going to give them 5 stars."

Stayed a few nights","This place was fantastic. Was in town for a week long amateur golf event in far northwest Vegas. So needed more space and the convenience of home, this place fit the bill and then some. Clean and spacious. Great location only 20mins to our event at Paiute golf resort and only 10-12min drive to Fremont street and the Vegas strip. I liked it being just far enough away for peace and quiet at night and during the day. The home had everything you needed to stay for a while and be comfortable. Had enough towels, dishware, other cleaning products where all you need to do is bring your clothes and your set. The only downside for our group of guys was the master bedroom was the only one with a tv in it, so the other 3 bedrooms were without."

Location is convenient for access to northern Las Vegas, Fremont Area and an easy drive/ride to the strip. Bathrooms were cleaned and stock, beds were comfy with plenty of pillows and blankets. This place is setup well and prepared to host groups."

The kitchen was fully stocked with everything you’d need to cook for the family. House is big, 2 floors with plenty of space to spread out and the outdoor space layout was perfect for visiting my son, his wife and 5 month old baby. Beds were comfy, plenty of towels, blankets and toiletries were available. House directions and general information was left for us, leaving us really wanting for nothing. I will never stay in another hotel in Vegas again if I could stay here. Thank you Artem & Family!"

I love Airbnb! I have stayed in many airbnb homes, but, not one with all that this beautiful home offered. Even the landscaping was well maintained, immaculate and beautifully designed. The BBQ was immaculate, though I did not use it! Each room was beautifully decorated, with well appointed amenities..

Plenty of space for all four of us.l and super functional kitchen/living area. The outdoor area was amazing for the kids - and adults! We paid to have the pool heated which was well worth it. The Vegas temps were still relatively low and swimming would not have been possible without the heated pool. We had no issues asking the host to kick on the hot tub when we wanted it. He was incredibly responsive and the hot tub heats up super fast. Super pleased with this stay!"

Stayed a few nights","I really wanted to give this place 5 stars because overall it was great! But I couldn’t for two reasons that may not bother most people, but it rubbed me the wrong way.
1. The host had total control of the hot tub and I had to contact him every time I wanted to use it so he could turn it on. So if I work up at 10am and wanted to take a quick soak first thing in the morning, I couldn’t. Water would be cold. I had to contact him asking to turn it on. And if the host is busy or not able to respond right away, then you’ll be out of luck on using the hot tub. Also, I noticed the hot tub stayed on when I was outside, but when I would go inside for 10 minutes or more, the hot tub would turn off making me feel like I was being watched.
2. The AC would not go below 71 degrees. The host had it locked at 71 and above. It’s Vegas, it gets extremely hot, 71 degrees May not be suitable for some people.
I’ve never once stayed in a AirBnb that controlled AC & the hot tub."

Group trip","Beautiful place with a great backyard with pool and hot tub. Very responsive host. My only two things that I would point out is because of a city ordinance in Henderson there is a strict no noise outside after 10P. We tried our best to respect this, but you're on vacation and you want to have fun. This rule was a little stressful. Also the location isn't the best if you want to be in the heart of the action. But if you want a quiet escape this is the place. Very clean."

No outside lights at all
And from 10-7pm no Pool access. To me why are you renting the place most people like to be outside at night enjoy a night swim and have lights on outside at night. I was on the patio outside. I went inside for a second. The lights were cut off. He cut the lights off outside, so I had to sit on the patio in the dark really. Like I said, great location. Need to cut down some of the rules. And I believe those rules were set to help manage the cost of the place. Really"

Stayed a few nights","The experience did not meet our expectations based on previous reviews. There were multiple issues upon arrival at the property (bbq not working, sheets in all beds full of crumbs and hairs, coffee pot had old brew, pool not heated although requested a week in advance). We’ve tried to reach out to our host and patiently waited for 5 hours. We contacted Airbnb to help us connect with the host however they too were unable to locate him. We were moved to another property nearby the next day. The house has a nice backyard and in great proximity to the strip. Sounds like this might’ve been one off for this host as he does have good reviews but its a ‘never again’ situation for us."

It was perfect for our family of 5 - the house is huge with 3 large bedrooms and bathrooms. The backyard was a highlight for our kids - the weather wasn’t great so we appreciated having the basketball court and mini golf to keep everyone busy. The spa and pool are beautiful and would be so perfect for warmer days! Vlad was very responsive to all messages and helpful with provident answers and instructions."

I would say it’s more of a home that expects you to relax and enjoy a very quiet, peaceful vacation . The home has a nice open concept. I think it’s better suited for 6 guest rather then 8 as the information says. Only because there are only 3 bedrooms with king beds. And seating in the living room for 4 adults. The views from the backyard are amazing . And we always had a super quick response from our host. Thank you for our staycation."

Stayed a few nights","Vladislav is a very attentive and communicative host. The house was clean, beautiful and had everything you needed to host a number of guests, 8 maximum to be specific so do not plan on having more than this through a single day. This was booked primarily as a surprise for my parters birthday very last minute. Although we do not consider ourselves partiers, quite the contrary to be honest, but when you start adding in a small close group of friends, family members and yourselves the quota can be a point of concern. If one is considering to book this unit over a period of several days be advised that an option is to fracture this group of eight or more on different days as to not break this limiting factor. Additionally pool curfew is strictly set at 10 PM as well as noise levels throughout the property will be closely and discreetly monitored via decibel meters throughout the rental. Another facet to be privy to is that security cameras for the safety of you, the property and perhaps to ensure guests are abiding to the aforementioned rules. These can be spotted around this Airbnb. All that said this by no means is meant to detract, just know what to expect. I would do the same in all honesty as an owner. Rules are founded by Airbnb, Vlad is just trying to abide. He is running a business after all so don’t be to hard on him and you should have a great time at the house."

But we had the whole house and there is no disturbance. Checking and parking is more complicated than usual due to sharing but instructions are clear and easy to follow.
Generally a very nice place for a few nights of stay and I would come back if I'm ever in Vegas again."

Stayed a few nights",Maria place was beautiful and interior design was pleasant with nice colors. The home was easy to access and parking was not a problem. You share the home with another unit. Sometimes you can hear the other guest in the other unit. The only bad thing I have to say about the home is the kitchen was dirty and the drawers and cabinets had alot of trash and bags stored. We found roaches in bedrooms and in the kitchen. Everything else was smooth sailing. I would recommend Maria home after the infestation is taken care of.

The place seemed to get cleaned only when there was guest turnover, so the bathroom did get pretty dirty when there was a consistent group staying. Keep in mind you'll be sharing the place with others, so the experience changed a bit depending on the other guests. Walls are thin and we could hear the other guests pretty clearly.
However, generally clean, convenient, plenty of parking, quiet neighbourhood. Felt very safe, even walking around at night."

Stayed over a week","My husband and I stayed at Eric’s place while searching for a new home - what a wonderful hidden gem! The common areas are clean and beautifully decorated and our room was absolutely perfect. The bed is comfy, the linens are soft and the Roku TV is a nice touch. As a side note, I work remote; I was able to attend my zoom meetings and video calls with ease, so the internet is fantastic. The kitchen is also great - plenty of space to store necessities for each guest and everything you need to prepare a meal. The neighborhood is cute and safe and walking distance to a grocery store and multiple restaurants. It is obvious that Eric and his wife have put a lot of time, attention and love into their home and it truly shows. Thank you for the wonderful stay, Eric!"

Stayed over a week","Eric's place is as pictured and perfect for what I needed. It is in a very quiet area that is close to a Rainbow st, which means access to places to eat and shop for groceries within walking distance.
If you have lots of time you can take 2 busses straight to the strip takes about one hour. About 20 minutes drive. The bus stop along rainbow is also within a few minutes walk. Just realize it is a shared house so you can't predict your house mates! Host is kind and helpful even though he didn't speak English we corresponded using the translation on Airbnb and apps."

Instructions on check-in and where to find things like the light switches were very clear and so helpful! The location felt safe. If I had to find a downside, it would be that you can sometimes hear noises from the main part of the house; if you live in apartments and tend to hear neighbors or roommates, this shouldn't be a problem for you."

It's a bit remote and we had to drive about 3 miles to get to restaurants and stores, so keep that in mind. Otherwise, it was a very comfortable stay. Thanks again to Nalda and Danilo!"

Clean, comfortable, and well-appointed, it is a perfect place to escape and unwind after a long night out – a short 15-20 minute drive from the Strip. I always prefer unique/private/cozy spaces over expensive/noisy downtown hotels and resorts. Also close to several excellent restaurants and markets. Plus Nalda is a great host – superb communication, easy check-in, seamless experience. Five stars!"

Stayed a few nights","Thank you for a nice stay! I went on a morning run and the area is very safe, clean and nice.
My 1st time in Centennial Hills. The only suggestion I would make to the hosts would be to nix the artificial air scent. I think something was squirting into the air on a regular interval. I am super sensitive to chemical smells and had to move some scent/odorizers outside on the patio area.
Initially I couldn't find the AC unit remote, but then sat near the bed and saw it attached to the wall directly above the nightstand. It was probably in the instructions but I missed it if it was.
Overall, thank you for a clean & nicely laid out place. It had everything I needed. This is a converted garage bay, so you go outside the bedroom area to access the bathroom. At night remember to step up and down to get to the bathroom. Secondary locks on the outside and inside doors would be nice for when someone is inside."

Stayed a few nights",House is pretty nice overall. Master bedroom door is not attached to the hinges very well . air-conditioning has a limit set on it and will not go below a certain degree and made it pretty warm in the place at night. It was very inconvenient to have to message each time we wanted the hot tub jets on and It never got warm because the host controls it from their phone. Place could definitely use some repairs and improvements. Master shower drain cover is not attached and is very sharp . Not having a garage keypad outside was very inconvenient because you have to go inside through house to open and close it each time . Ac vents / returns are all very dirty. Host was responsive.

Group trip","let me start by saying the host was responsive and friendly. As for the house, first and foremost every piece of furniture was uncomfortable, it was cheap staging furniture. we wouldn't sit on the bar stools because they were so flimsy, the dining room chairs were also cheap. understand that as per the pictures every bed is practically floor level. as for the pool table it looks great in the picture, but in reality you can not shoot from either side, the walls are to close! Then there is the Hot tub and pool. read the ad carefully , there is a 50 dollar per day charge if you want to heat the pool and that can take up to 14 hrs. and in order to use the hot tub you need to text to get it turned on! I've personally never ran across that in any Airbnb before. there are probably over 15 remotes in the house, and good luck figuring out what one works, what, and the internet is spotty. as for the location, if you are looking for somewhere quite this is not for you, main Rd out front."

Group trip","The ""bed"" in the casita is not a bed! There is no way an adult (let alone 2 adults) can sleep on that furniture. The listing said the home had five bedrooms with five beds and could sleep 10 people. This is very misleading because its not accurate. The property only have four beds. The furniture in the casita is not a bed! Unfortunately for us, one of the couples in our group had to sleep at another location each night because the bed in the casita is not a bed as we were falsely led to believe from the Airbnb listing!"

Stayed a few nights","Really nice house with lots of space for our family (5 pax). Our kids very much enjoyed having an own bedroom each and the really nice backyard with awesome pool.
The outdoor kitchen was great and we‘ve enjoyed the BBQ!
TV screens in each bedroom and living room worked really well and the fully equipped kitchen and washroom were great for a family like ours.
We nevertheless faced two issues not directly related to the house itself:
1. Ants in the house, mainly in the kitchen & living room but also in one of the bedrooms (our son had to move from this room to another). We‘ve contacted Vladislav and he told us he will take care of it after our departure. This obviously didn’t help us during our stay for two nights.
2. Construction area on adjacent properties habe been annoying due to the noise. Our stay during weekdays has been a affected by that. If it would have been mentioned in the ad we would habe chosen another place to stay even if the house was great."

It felt good to be right there amongst everything and not have to go home. The parking structure isn’t the best, and difficult to maneuver. Check-in was simple and easy, and went quite well. Just note, that if you’re looking for hospitality, and people to be nice to you, it is not a place to stay. For the price that I paid, I got what I paid for."

Since it was non refundable I could not cancel it, and had to accept that fact. I wish they would make it very clear before you book it. Maybe a pop up window saying something like ""there is an additional $39.49 hotel fee to be paid when you check in, do you want to proceed?""
But overall was a good price."

Stayed a few nights","I didn’t know it was a first come first served deal. When I arrived they only had a smoking floor and my clothes ended up smelling like cigarettes. They were able to move me the next day to a non-smoking room, but still something good to know.
If you’re going to Vegas to spend on Fremont street this is the perfect spot! Takes you directly onto street from hotel.
If you’re looking to be on the strip, it’s quite a distance and about $20+ Uber ride everytime.
Besides that, it’s somewhere to lay my head and a clean bathroom if you’re looking more for activities and not to be at the resort."

The only thing I would say is that they need they need to make their Uber eats policy clear. Other than that very nice stay!"

Lots of nearby restaurants, grocery stores, Walmart / Costco, and near the freeway. Takes about 25-30 minutes to the Las Vegas Strip. This was a great house to stay in for a large group if you're looking for a place to stay away from the Strip. Took between 30min - 1 hour to drive back home from EDC. Malee was a great communicative host and was able to troubleshoot some of our concerns remotely."

Before the trip:
We have a 10 month old baby, so getting an airbnb instead of a hotel was the best decision ever at Vegas. Yeni was very proactive because she asked me if I needed a bassinet/packnplay for my baby.
During the trip:
The airbnb looks exacty like the ones in pictures. All the decorations were very modern and simple at the same time. We felt very relaxed staying there. The location was also easy to get around, it took less than 20 minutes to get to the strip. 
We will definitely book their place again the next time we visit Vegas!"

Stayed a few nights","Our favorite things about Yeni's place!
The shower and bed in the owners suite were awesome, pair this with upgraded floors, counter tops and cabinets, luxury linens, comfy sofa, good location and excellent communication you have a stay of a finer hotel.
Though the place was a little stark for decor and extras we believe she is in the process of adding these addtional creature comforts down the road.
That being said we would still stay again."

Stayed one night","Came in from LA for a sweet sixteen birthday. Location was great, nice clean quiet neighborhood. It's 7 min from the shopping center, cheesecake factory, starbucks, wendy's, Mc.D's and shopping (15-20 to strip). Easy freeway access was the best part as you didn't have to drive much inland to get to the house. Super, super, super clean and nice decor! Kitchen has everything you need, although we didn't use any of it. They even had hot coco =) You can easily park two vehicles in the garage and they had washer and dryer if needed. I used the iron and it was a super nice one (no ironing board?) We had a little hick up with locking up the front electronic door, but one call and Yani immediately was quick to fix it. She even had a back up key which was very impressive. I would definitely say here again!!!! Thanks Yani"

Stayed a few nights","The Host responded right away to my questions and was very informative about the suite and check-in process. I liked how there was privacy to the room as it was still walkable to the main MGM and strip but still further away for privacy.
The complimentary valet service was great but they should provide the specific hours for valet service. We came back to our suite late that valet service was not available.
Also, security needs to do a better job at making sure all guests show their room key before entering elevator. There was one person that entered the elevator without a room key."

No body wash in shower dispenser.
Hand soap dispenser in bathroom sink does not work.
Empty body lotion bottle in bathroom.
Balcony is inaccessible.
Parking is inconvenient.
Overall stay was just decent."

This probably falls on the “cleaning crew” so I didnt get upset. It was just very gross and nasty. If my lady was with me, we would of had problems. Luckily it was me and I was there for my kids. But the bed and bathroom was NOT ok. Outside of that, “balcony view is a 10”"

Loved the black out curtains for my sleep. Even had the pleasure of using the full size jacuzzi tub for once (I’m tall). The amenities were great and with a short walk, I was on the strip.

Stayed a few nights","The view from the balcony is amazing - from the outline of New York, New York to the south to the Sphere to the north - especially for anything happening on Harmon Ave. Truly better views than the grandstands for F1! Staying in the Signature Towers at MGM is also lovely - you can easily access all MGM and the Las Vegas Strip has to offer, with the benefit of being a little more secluded and not stepping off the elevators into a crowded, smoky casino. Having a full bathroom was also a pleasure - the whirlpool tub was great to soak in after a long day of walking the city and the walk-in shower pressure was A+. As other reviews have noted (and it's really the only negative) the carpets in the room are heavily stained and need to be replaced. Even though everything else was very well cleaned in my opinion, it still leaves the impression of a dirty room. That said, host & service through eProNet was fantastic - very responsive to all questions and needs before and during the stay."

Stayed a few nights","So I am a very easy person to please, and the stay was great, especially with the price I paid. Was more than reasonable. The service was awesome a long with the check ups you all did throughout my stay.
I do have some feedback though, as these rooms normally go for over 300 a night. If I was paying that much, I would have been totally disappointed because we are being charged a 100.00 cleaning fee but there was nothing clean about that room. And in all honesty, I don’t know why I or anyone would pay a cleaning fee when it’s clearly not being used to keep the room clean. I sent pictures to you all to show how the room was with all the stains in the carpet, couch, non-working lights, and dirty lampshades. There was also a huge stain in bedding….
I really would like to request that I be refunded for the cleaning fee. It doesn’t make any sense that I pay that when the room was that filfthy upon check-in.
Other than that, everything was great. Service was impeccable."

Stayed a few nights",This is a full package deal. What I mean is this is perfect for a small family. You really get everything you need from kitchen to pool access. Unfortunately walking to the main strip/ Las Vegas Blvd still feels to far away. I would say walking to planet Hollywood is pretty close. But if you Uber around back and forth this is perfect. The view from this location is even better then the pictures. Balcony access is amazing. If you want to take advantage of the kitchen be sure to let the host know. Also if you drive in you always have to valet at no additional cost. You do get access to the MGM pool which is pretty cool. Even tho I did have a really good time I just don’t feel staying off strip even if it’s just a little bit is the Las Vegas experience. But if you want a home vibe with kitchen and you like staying in the hotel this is way better then staying on strip.

Stayed a few nights","Looked better in the photos! The room had worn & outdated furniture. The balcony was very dirty - It looked like it had not been cleaned after the last guests were there, as there was a pipe outside. The bathroom towels were old and thin. But the bed was comfortable and the hotel was quiet."

Stayed a few nights",We definitely enjoyed our stay! My only issue is that if valet is full they make you park at the mgm and the walk back to your room is over a mile. They made us do this two nights in a row and the last night we were checking out the next morning so that was a huge inconvenience for us. Loved the view and vibes! Host was great and responded quickly! Overall it was a good bang for our buck!

Stayed with kids",Great Place to stay in Vegas! Great responsive host. I really like the gated community vibe. Full kitchen if needed for extended stays. Pool was only open on weekends from 9-5 though.

Stayed a few nights","Great stay at a nice condotel just off the strip. It would've been nice if more amenities were available later, such as the pool/spa, valet, etc. Really like the concept and would strongly recommend to those that want access to the strip but maybe don't want it to hit them in the face the minute they step out of their room. It was also very nice to have a balcony."

Stayed a few nights","Overall, we enjoyed our stay and liked that it cost less than renting a room directly through the property. The room is in tower 3 and has a balcony overlooking the pool and parts of the strip. There is free valet parking, which is a bonus. The towers have an indoor walkway that connects to the MGM Grand so it was quick to get there, which we really liked. The host communication was fast. The room seemed clean enough, but had a good bit of wear in the carpet and the bathroom sink handles were a bit leaky. I didn’t like the pressure I got from the host to send them a photo of my ID through a message on the app, but ultimately they agreed that I could show it at check in which I was more comfortable with. Overall, the pros outweighed the cons so I would consider staying with this host again if the price was right."
