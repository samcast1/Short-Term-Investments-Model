Stayed with a pet","Dustin’s place was perfect for a cozy stay on our roadtrip. It had everything we needed, was perfectly clean, the parking spot was right outside, and private. It was easy to check-in and comfortable! Couldn’t ask for a better spot to crash!"

The location was excellent - close to Rte 80 and stores, and Dustin's directions were very clear and easy to follow. I especially appreciated the full, well-stocked kitchen. Dog walks were easy around the neighborhood and Dustin even provided a few other suggestions for places to exercise my pup. I would absolutely stay here again!"

Stayed with a pet",What a nice tiny home to rest in. Dustin was great and communicative. I got delayed due to a blizzard and he was quick to respond and was nice enough to refund the night I had to cancel. I came in the next day and was glad to see a notebook with local suggestions. I had a delicious dinner at North 40 Chophouse and saw a little bit of North Platte. Everything was easy and the house has everything to make a stay comfortable & cozy!

Dustin checked in with us right away to give us arrival details, and their place was updated, fresh, and cozy. The bed was super comfortable and we appreciated the extra touches (treats and dog bowls for our pup, snacks and coffee for us, and easy phone charger built into the nightstand). It’s close to everything in town and convenient, but also very quiet inside. We’d absolutely stay again if we find ourselves back in town!"

A terrible snow storm came through and he made sure there was a snow shovel and also informed us he would be by to shovel the walk. Being able to stay in such an amazing home allowed us to be with family for Christmas and that is priceless. Thank you Dustin and Noelle!!!!"

Stayed with a pet","This was a really great place to stay for a few days in North Platte. Although it is small, it really was the perfect size for 1 or 2 people and the layout was thoughtfully planned. Getting in was easy and the place was really cute and clean. The bed, pillows, and chair were all really comfortable. The kitchen had all of the necessities that I needed to cook for myself. I really appreciated how thoughtful Dustin was in providing pet dishes and a few treats for my pet. He also thought of his guests with coffee and a few snacks. The heater and tankless hot water heater both worked great and the instructions to use the Roku were clear. I would definitely recommend this place if you’re going to be in North Platte."

Stayed one night","I must say that we were pleasantly surprised by the interior of the place. I was probably a little judgemental standing on the outside as it looked so small and I thought it was a shack. however, once the door opened I was amazed. it was so beautiful and done really well. the shower was amazing with never ending high pressure water. after a long day driving it was relief. if I could pick up this rental and put it in the middle of nowhere for hunting season, I would. very nice place and probably one of the best we have been to in a while now."

Stayed with a pet","My wife, pooch, and I stayed at Noelle’s for one night on the way to Colorado for a long weekend. As the first guests of Dustin and Noelle, we can say their place is a fantastic AirBnB. Although small, it seemed spacious! The space was very well planned out, the bathroom was VERY nice and the entire place was immaculately clean. The location is close enough to the interstate that it is easy to find but not so far into town that it is away from restaurants and businesses. The dog park is only about a mile away as well. I would highly recommend staying here for traveling through or even if you are in North Platte for a visit. We are hoping we get the chance to stay again! Thanks for having us!"

We were able to book Mary’s place with our three dogs so quickly and we’re so incredibly grateful to be able to drop in on such short notice. It was such a lifesaver and we were so cozy in a very, otherwise, stressful situation. Thank you again for accommodating us!"

Group trip","Mary's Place: Host was easy to contact and very responsive. House had nice layout and was nicely decorated, easy access, nice neighborhood. However, needs to clearly let people know there is a 1st floor rental and basement rental because some people may not appreciate sharing same house or may want to rent both. Furniture is dated and could use more end tables/coffee tables. House was dirty and needed a good cleaning (EX: Dusty, counters dirty, animal hair on floor, appliances dirty inside and out, tubs/toilets washing machine dirty (Suggest cleaning service). Closets, one door broken and messy. Unused decorations just shoved under curio. Refrigerator didn't work but they did replace it promptly with new one. Stove on main floor had baked on food and digital panel didn't work so couldn't use. Shower floor a little slippery and could use some safety bars and better floor mats/towels/wash clothes and more toilet paper. Also had to share driveway with owners ( Inconvenient )"

It was very convenient that the house was pet friendly. There was plenty of yard space with a very green yard. Mary's place was in a very quaint area of town and a short drive from numerous restaurants and venues. I will definitely recommend people stay here and would stay again.

Stayed with kids","Mary's place had a communicative host, easy to use lock, safe neighborhood, and free laundry. I come to North Platte frequently and usually stay at a hotel, but I couldn't find a hotel room for these dates, so decided I would try air b and b. This was my first air b and b experience and it makes me not want to use air b and b again. The furniture was very poor quality and uncomfortable, esp the beds and dining chairs. There was a great deal of trash under the king bed. There was trash on the floor near the trash can in the kitchen to include cigarettes. There is a sign not to smoke and we do not smoke, but the house smelled like cigarettes and cats. In fact, there was a cat at the back patio constantly scratching, and making noise, and climbing on the screens. The hand soap was running out in the bathrooms. There were small bars of soap provided, but the towels were very small and thin. The bathrooms were extremely dingy and dirty with hair and grime on all surfaces and dirty rugs."

Stayed one night","BEWARE: This was by far the worst Airbnb experience I have ever had and I've traveled and stayed at Airbnbs all over the US including Hawaii, several times.
We arrived at the house and it was 79° inside, we learned later on that not all of the vents work and at 9 pm it was still 75° in the house , we were in a heat advisory also. We were under the impression that this was a single unit, buy quickly learned otherwise when a stranger came to the door and started to try to get in. The only thing separating the upstairs from the downstairs is a laundry room door and there are vents from the kitchen to the laundry open that are open and we can see through them and hear everything. We messaged the host to ask if there was another unit that other people were staying in and said they said yes. When we told them that the listing didn't state that it was two units, they told us we could leave.
Over the next hour or so we found that the Airbnb was dirty. There was a fake eyelash stuck to the couch, dirty dishes put back in the cupboards, the bathroom towels and rugs were crunchy and dirty, and there were used bars of soap in the bathrooms. Once bathroom toilet had been sprayed with blue bathroom cleaner but never wiped down so there were just dried up blue streaks all over the toilet. There was literally trash left behind up other people that no one bothered to clean up.
We started looking at other reviews that were more recent since we booked this 3 months in advance and learned that other people had not so pleasant stays, and not so pleasant interactions with the host. Given that our first interaction with the host wasn't great, we decided not to message them again.
The next day, we were at the parade in town and we received a text that they were kicking us out and we needed to come get our stuff. We arrived shortly after and found that the hosts had gone through our stuff and threw a bunch of it in a pile on the floor and then wouldn't let us collect the rest of our belongings. They literally trapped one of us on the porch blocking the door way and we ended up having to call the police for assistance. They kept saying that we did nothing but complain the entire night before and that no one can afford to travel anymore and everyone is just looking for a free place to stay, but at least they got paid for one nights stay. After leaving and going to a hotel for the night, we learned that not only had they gone through our stuff, but they threw the trash that someone else left behind inside one of the suitcases and stole a bottle of perfume.
Video and photo documentation was sent to Airbnb support, and the support team was amazing to work with, but this place and these people are not worth it!!"

There were food crumbs on kitchen counters, couch, and floors. Stovetop was dirty. Hosts husband started to clean but when i asked if the beds were clean (considering nothing else was), he said ""he wasn't going to deal with this and we could go find somewhere else to stay."" He said he would call his wife and refund my money because we weren't staying there. I was Not very happy!! Now 5 people had to find other accommodations at a motel for 2 nights."

My suggestion would be to fold linens neater. It sounds nitpicky, but presentation means a lot. All the linens were just kind of thrown in the cabinets. There was also someone’s contact lens in the kitchen sink. A baby bottle top was left in the master bedroom. The bed slept well. No real issues."

Group trip","Unfortunately, the initial contact went well however things went awry towards the end. Through a number of emails I expressly let the host know that I needed a specific checkout date and could I get that. She assured me that everything was good however after arriving and staying two days we were literally kicked out on Sunday because the host allowed an overbooking for Sunday night. My things were moved to the garage while we were out at a family function. There were 6 of us already in the house that were suppose to have been there Friday, Saturday and Sunday. There were only two people coming for one night and we were obviously overbooked. So instead of accommodating and not displacing a group of six (already settled in for one more night), they chose to kick us out to accommodate a couple staying for one night. We had discussed with the host and her husband how we might fix this and while the husband did say that they would work something out, they opted to simply put ALL of our stuff in a pile in the garage. My whole family were extremely upset and forced to get a hotel for our last night in town. Seems the confusion was on the side of the host but we got the raw end of the deal."

Basically everything was in order but we had to vacuum the couch because there were chip crumbs all over it and the kitchen/dining room floor was not swept or mopped.
We also were not aware that it was a shared unit with people staying in the downstairs below. Overall they were quiet, but when they accessed their unit, we could hear them talking quite clearly through the shared laundry room."

Mary was quick with responses and flexible on check in and check out times. Loved that she had satellite tv to watch, it’s rare to see this and appreciate it. Nice shower in the master. Great quiet neighborhood.
Cons- bedding did smell of smoke and towels are old and hard. In need of new items. No soaps or shampoos for showers. Thankfully no one was staying in the basement during our stay but did not like that I was not aware that it was a shared place when booking.
We travel a lot, Of all the air bnbs we have stayed at it was on the top of our list and would stay again if we ever came through the area again."

I was under the impression that we got the whole house so was surprised to see a sign that said the basement was rented also. I never did see or hear anyone but it made me a little uneasy when I got there the first night with just myself and my two daughters because there was a door to the basement right in the front room. Unfortunately, the sectional smelled like smoke and my allergies flared up. The one room also smelled a little funky. Beds were ok. Overall it was a great price point and a lot of room. Just a few little fixes and it would be even better!"

The master shower with the rain down shower head was a real treat. For a second as I washed my hair I thought I was outside in the rainforests of Indonesia. Not to mention that infinity shower drain. Decccent shower pan!!! I Respect the craftsmanship kid.
Now I will say I did show up to the house a little intoxicated for my stay. And as I stumbled to the couch I saw a book of genius book of world records on the end table. Absolutely amazing!! I got lost in that for 45 mins.
The stay was amazing. A 5 out of 5, the pie, the whip cream, and the cherry!! I’ll be back to north platte and I’ll be back to Mary’s place."

The home was cozy, clean and had every comfort of home. Bonus was being around the corner from an amazing Mexican restaurant.

Beds were comfy, living room was perfect and the kitchen was well stocked with what we needed to cook with. The only negative is a pretty small bathroom, but I'm guessing it's an older house.
I'd recommend staying here."

The home is an older home, with a fairly steep staircase to the upstairs two bedrooms, but there are two bedroom on the main floor if you're traveling with elderly guests. The living room furniture was comfortable and accommodating. The kitchen had new appliances, a coffee bar and some cracker snacks. It was fairly well stocked with dishware, glasses, pots/pans. There was a washer/dryer on main level, but no laundry soap. There is a Walgreens in walking distance which was handy to pick up laundry soap and snacks. There are several nice touches such as extra lap blankets, first aid kit, bathroom products etc. Overall a very good value."

All of the linen was clean, the house was spotless, the beds were comfortable (as comfortable as they can be sleeping with children), she provided snacks and candies (which the kiddos loved), the shower pressure is AMAZING and the tub is extremely deep! It is also in such a convent spot in town. Walgreens, and the shopping mall are all within walking distance of 2 blocks. Walmart is a 5 minute drive. And there are so many eating establishments within 5-8 minutes driving!
We will be back this summer. Thanks again, Kari!"

There are two good-sized bedrooms. One had a king sized bed and the other had the queen sized bed. I stayed in the queen bedroom. Also, the rooms had ceilings fans. The living room had a flat screen tv with Roku. The kitchen was stocked with enough pots and pans to make simple dishes. The bathroom had nice fluffy towels.
I would like to come back."

I stayed at Kari's place for almost 3 weeks for work and it was great to come ""home"" after working all day as opposed to a sterile hotel room, really helped me to relax.
Kari's place was clean and fresh, the cold water bottles and snacks on the table were a nice touch as I had just made a 10 hr drive to get there.
The neighborhood was quiet, which I appreciated as I always had computer work to do after I completed my work on site. There are several restaurants in the area and some you can walk to if you desire.
If I have the opportunity to work in North Platte again then I will certainly try to stay here again."

Stayed one night","We did not have a restful stay here. At bedtime we discovered that there was no top sheet on the bed - only a heavy duvet. We roasted at first, then, fortunately used a light blanket we travel with, as we could not locate a top sheet anywhere. The property needs some care: stains on the carpet, a torn lamp shade, clocks that don't work. The table chair I sat in was so loose that I feared it would collapse. The front steps are steep and shallow and a hazard - and also largely unpainted and down to bare wood. The house did appear to be clean, though the sheets were dark and patterned and not white, so we couldn't tell about the bedding"

I had mentioned that we might be on our motorcycles, and Shane left a key for access to the garage. weather was bad so we didn't have to use but will definitely stay here on our next trip when on the bikes. Great place for the price. overall I give place 4/5 stars. side note: if you are 6 foot tall and above you will love the shower."

My friend considered hers too soft. Shane states in the listing the house has stairs you must be able to maneuver. I would underline this if you have any mobility or balance issues. the top stair/landing is shallow. Normal mobile people would not notice the difference but it was an issue for my cane toting friend.

Stayed with kids","A GREAT place to stay! We walked in and immediately said ""oh this is so cute!"". It's modern and spacious and clean and very adorable. There's a driveway that will fit 2 cars, and even a garage to use, though we didn't. The backyard is a HUGE perk! It has privacy fence on two sides and chain link on the alley side. There's a grill and a fire pit area and patio furniture. We played soccer in the yard. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. We saw many kids out playing and walking and roller skating. Not far from the high school. The house is clean and roomy. A/C worked great.
The host was SUPER accommodating. Actually, they couldn't have been more accommodating if they tried...so understanding and easy to deal with. Very communicative, and gave me all the check in info I needed before I even asked for it
We've booked this for our return trip too. A well deserved 5 star review from this happy traveler."

The kitchen had all the essential dishes, utensils, and pans. We liked the openness of the living room/dining room/kitchen area. The stairs to the front door might be of concern to some with less sure footing. There were a few other concerns that kept us from giving a five-star review, but we feel confident that Shane will correct these things once brought to his attention as they are easy fixes that will make his place even more comfortable."

Stayed with kids","I had the chance to stay at this place twice, and both times were truly enjoyable. It's worth noting that this is a shared residence, and Mark and Muriel, the hosts, are incredibly welcoming and experienced. They really know how to make guests feel at home. During our second stay, the atmosphere was so warm and inviting that it felt like we were staying with close family. The space was perfect for my kids, and the room itself was cozy and comfortable. The beds were particularly comfortable, and the room had blackout curtains that made sleeping in a breeze. One of our favorite features was the large clawfoot bathtub, which I used to give my daughter a bath. To top it off, I even got to enjoy watching Sunday night football with Mark while drinking some whiskey I brought along, which was a nice surprise."

If the room felt a bit chilly, there was a convenient space heater at hand. Plus, they had power strips right next to the bed for charging devices – a small but thoughtful touch.
Muriel was incredibly responsive, and she quickly addressed all our messages. The property itself is just beautiful, with its lush green lawns, towering trees, and a peaceful, quiet atmosphere that's perfect for relaxation.
The beds were not only large but also incredibly comfortable. After a long day of driving, I slept really well. I can already say with certainty that the next time I visit my family in Nebraska, I'll be booking a stay here again."

Stayed one night","Muriel was very responsive & I was very grateful since her place appeared booked up from when I first communicated with her... However she made some accomodations that permitted me to book it & I was so grateful! (As I know I could not have made it any further that night toward Colorado, on my trip to the West Coast).
A truly lovely home with every detail thought of. I especially love the welcome greeting she had in the bedroom which was very beautiful and touching about travelers' journeys through life.
The front porch was great to sit on and listen to the train whistle and watch the sunset... And walking my dogs in the evening, listening to the Friday night high school football announcer ""Touchdown Sutherland Sailors!""...what a lovely, small town America experience.
**I recommend this Airbnb**
Muriel even told me about an amazing fenced, luscious dog park nearby that I was able to take my furry girls to, prior to checking in!"

The black out shades were nice so we could sleep in. It was just outside of town but close to everything. The meal voucher and wooden nickels for drinks to Pal's was great to have so we could check it out. The pizza was awesome and the staff was very attentive like they know us for years. I would recommend staying here to anyone who wanted to visit North Platte.

We arrived late and it was cold and windy, we were tired. The little house was just perfect, we felt right at home and it was cozy. We had a good night's sleep and got up early to see the prairie chickens, which was amazing. We talked about how we wished we were staying longer so we could enjoy the cabin longer! Pal's was also wonderful. We plan on coming back next year to see the cranes and maybe stay a little longer."

I loved the wooded setting so much. It’s truly hard to leave. Even though it’s on a lot with another house and on a busy road, it feels so private and the traffic dies down to practically nothing at night.The food voucher and beer tokens for Pals brewing is such a nice perk. The food and the beer is so good, but the standout is the staff. So kind, so efficient. I loved talking with them! I can’t wait to come back. Such a great little place."

This was the first listing that showed up in my Air B and B search and I knew it would be perfect. And it was. Spotlessly clean, well appointed, a secluded feeling location and the most comfortable bed! I loved my stay, and hope to return very soon as the weather didn’t exactly cooperate with my plans this time. Oh and the proximity to Pals Brewing (with tokens for beer and a voucher for food) was the icing on the cake. Great beer and pizza and wonderful people. There truly is no place like Nebraska."

Love the place & will totally recommend the Bed & Brew to anyone looking for a quiet, comfy, just like home place to stay while visiting North Platte.

Stayed one night","This is a great little cabin. It was perfect for my husband and me as a one-night layover on our was home for Colorado. In fact, we're inspired to go back to the area in the fall for a Know West Nebraska tour.
It's owned by the people who run a micro brewery that is only .2 miles away. While that's close enough to walk to, the brewery wasn't so close that you noticed traffic or noise while at the cabin. The cabin even had some discounts for the brewery.
The host was helpful with directions and instructions. We didn't need to have further contact with her. What contact we did have was great.
The cabin was clean and had great amenities. It was decorated in a very cute fashion. We'll probably ask to stay there again if we go back in the fall."

Mendy was great and for a small family of 2-4, this place works great! 1 bathroom attached to only bedroom is why we say 1 small family, which was perfect for myself and my husband. The only thing I would say is that for the price, we shouldn’t have had to clean anything. But this is a general issue with Air BNB that there is a ‘cleaning fee’ as a part of the cost, but you still have to do a lot of the general cleaning yourself."

It’s like a cabin in the woods with modern amenities! We really appreciated how clean it was. The day bed/trundle would be perfect for a couple grandkids. And although we didn’t use the washer/dryer, it was nice to know it was there! It’d be a great stopover for travelers on their way to another destination. North Platte itself has fun shopping and restaurants.
The short walk to Pals Brewing Company was a bonus!"

Stayed one night","Having stayed at SO many homes that were in wooded areas this is the ONLY place we’ve stayed in; a beautiful area such as this, surrounded by trees that has been completely immaculate! Every corner in the home is absolutely spotless! We were so impressed and pleased with our stay!
We felt right at home and definitely enjoyed the PALS pizza and homemade brew! Delicious!😋
Wish we could’ve stayed longer! We hope to be back soon!
Highly, highly recommend!"

Less than an hour from North Platte, I contacted Mendy through the ap requesting to reserve the cabin. In less time than it took to stop at a rest stop, Mendy responded to us and we had a place to stay. We were very pleased how clean the cabin was. It was very comfortable and we felt right at home. We took advantage of the voucher and wooden nickels for the Pals Brewing Company and enjoyed the pizza and craft beer. Overall, the stay was far more satisfying than any of the local hotels (which we have stayed at in the past) could have been. Thank you"

No issues with check-in or the property so we had no reason for direct communication with Mendy but have no doubt it would have been responsive if needed. Food and drink vouchers provided for their brewery were welcome. Due to a scheduled event, brewery was packed the evening of our arrival so we elected to utilize the vouchers for lunch after our check-out. Brewery staff was friendly and very accommodating."

Stayed a few nights","We were visiting North Platt for a few days and I was happy to find a place that gave us more room than a local hotel.
Mendy was a great host. We had no problems finding the place and checking in and out process was simple and well communicated.
I wanted to take advantage of the fire pit but was unable to but hopefully next time we can.
There is a coffee maker with someK cups, along with sugar and creamer.
Kitchen are was stocked and available if we wanted to use it.
Pals Brewery was a short drive and served pub like food. Salad and pizza were great. Customer service was excellent. Event Admission is free with stay ( check the event calendar on Pal’s page)
The room darkening blinds and separate bedroom entrance was two things that stood out for me. Once I finally woke up i was able to go for a walk without disturbing my daughter asleep in the front room.
I will definitely book this property for our next visit to North Platt/Maxwell area."

Instuctions were On-Point and no difficulty with directions or key retrieval upon arrival.
We were smitten at first glance at the cabin and surrounding area.
Upon opening the door, this adorable & cozy cabin becomes a personal oasis that is stocked to fill most needs, full kitchen, the shower is amazing with thick towels, and when morning comes, you will Not want to leave the luxury of the queen bed!
Wooden Nickels and a food voucher for Pals await as a welcome touch of unique hospitality.
We certainly felt very spoiled with a 5-Star first Airbnb experience.

I enjoyed my breakfast on the porch while I watched the bunnies and the birds!
We used our nickels and voucher for Pal's. What a neat place! Definitely stop by there if you're in North Platte.
Thanks so much! Hope to go back again one day!"

This was our second stay at this rental and our third year in a row visiting North Platte. The rental is very close to Golden Spike Tower and it is located in a nice, quiet neighborhood with great sidewalks for walking. This time I did encounter some cleanliness issues but spoke with the host and she assured me the issues will be addressed. If the housekeepers are doing a good job I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend renting this home."

Stayed one night","Absolutely amazing place! We are not ones who travel through NE often, we’re currently traveling on military orders and had to come through the area. This place was extremely affordable for our budget and went over and beyond what we imagined. With 3 rooms, my toddler got her own room where I sat up her pack n play, my 10 year old had her own room to video with her friends and my husband and I got to stay up later and plan the rest of our trip. We’re both big morning coffee people and Deb had plenty of k cups with a variety of little creams and sugars. The towels were displayed so nicely in each room. Very clean home, but still comfortable to relax in. Big back yard for kids or dogs to stretch and run. Safe neighborhood and not far from restaurants and stores. 10/10 loved. Kind of hope we have a reason to come back!"

We were passing through on a loooong road trip and it was excellent to get off the highway and be in a home vs hotel. The place was quiet, clean and comfy for humans and pets. The fenced yard is quite amazing for dogs, which we feel so thankful that this place allowed. If you don’t have pets with you I think you’d still find this home to be spotless. Deb is a great host, not too much or too little communication. Would absolutely stay again if staying in North Platte."

Stayed one night","Mary was very nice and helped us get inside because we didn't understand exactly. Turns out that even though its a basement rental, you enter on the main floor in the back. And the 2nd locked door is inside.
The inside was roomy and clean, though not necessarily pristine. It was nice to have a full size refrigerator so no issues with needing more space. No ice maker, but plenty of ice trays. A working dehumidifier. A small but working tv.
Microwave. We didn't use the oven or stove.
There's a table with chairs for 4.
A full size bed in one bedroom, which has a door to the bathroom, and a queen and a full size in the other bedroom. The bathroom has 2 doors so is accessible to all areas. Everything was clean to our satisfaction and had a homey feel... not hotel like. We like that. Wall heaters in each area for desired comfort. Beds were comfortable enough. The place had one extra ""fire""- escape - an egress window. And no bugs!
All in all, we do recommend the place."

If someone is staying in the house above, you can hear them moving about constantly, unfortunately that did not work well for my work schedule. The stairs to get to the basement apartment are steep and there is a shared washer and dryer; other tenants would leave their clothes in for days. And there was a bug problem, mainly ants and spiders, ants being the worst. The apartment is large and spacious, but you can hear random noises (bangs and pops) from the pipes at all different times of the day."

Stayed one night","This listing had potential, but in the end we only stayed one of the two nights we planned. The house is easy to find, plenty of parking, the lawn is nice, and entry was easy. However, as soon as we walked in there was a washer and dryer (listed for use) covered with laundry and no detergent available. Then when we got to the basement it looked like no one had been down there in months. There were tons of dead (and some living) bugs all over the floors. The table was dirty, and the bathroom sink had hair all over it, even the night stand had layers of dust on it. Thankfully the refrigerator, toilet, shower and sheets seemed clean, which were the only reasons we stayed the first night (that and the fact we came in very sleep deprived and put the baby right to sleep.) However, with a crawling baby, we weren’t willing to stay the second night as we didn’t want him anywhere near those floors. Mary’s communication was poor. It took her at least 3 hours to respond any time I reached out. And then she said she would approve a refund for the second night and did not. There are even more issues that he I’m not listing, but ultimately, I do not recommend this listing at all."

Convenient parking space, well lit, right at entrance. It is a basement apartment, so you do have steep stairs to navigate. However, the stairs are large, easy to see, and very sturdy, as is the handrail.
Wi-Fi works great, and communicating with the host is easy.
I was here for 45 days. It was perfect for what I needed. I would definitely stay again!"

Stayed with kids","We stayed here twice within the same week, a few days apart. The first time we stayed, the place was okay. It was cool, there is a dehumidifier running next to the kitchen sink, and no one was upstairs, so it was nice and quiet. The queen bed is as hard as a rock, so we had to move to the sofa. The posting claims that there is a sofa bed in the second bedroom, but there is not. The second time we stayed, the shower curtain smelled like pee and there were dirty and wet linens and towels in the washer when we arrived, so I had to remove those before starting the washing machine. I don't expect that the beds are given fresh comforters or blankets or that the spare blankets are washed after each guest. There is no cleaning fee charged, so I imagine that's why the price is better. I had to go knock on the door upstairs at 10:30 because my family was awakened by the kids staying upstairs. This wasn't the owner's fault by any means, but just know that you can hear all of the movement from upstairs. Overall, the place was good enough for a quick night's rest for my family of 6 after a few days of driving, but the cleaning is not thorough. Again, there is no cleaning fee involved so the value for the price was accurate. Mary was quick in responding and very willing to be available for assistance."

An hour or so from Lake Mac and in a town with a LOT of cool history (don’t miss Buffalo Bill’s Ranch or the Golden Spike!), Mary’s is indeed a homey and spacious gem. Easy check in, which was extra nice since we booked super last minute, safe neighborhood, quick drive to get coffee in the morning."

Stayed with kids","Mary's place was affordable and a great stop on our way to SD. The space was large and fit my family well enough. I would suggest a few folding chairs for eating around the table as there were only 4. I would also suggest a side table in the room with one bed as I needed a handy place for my glasses/phone. my kids loved this place as it was a ""maze"" and fun to ""explore"". Mary had excellent recommendations for food in the area as well."

Normally it wouldn't bother us but our youngest daughter is allergic. After extra cleaning we were able to enjoy our month long stay.

And much more space than you’d get for the same price at a hotel. Previous reviews mentioned linen issues. Everything looked clean to me, maybe just not folded or beds made as neatly as could be. We arrived very late but check in/out is completely flexible and self-serve so that was no problem. Quiet neighborhood. Good, quick, welcoming, gracious communication."

The home is easy to find with great parking. Kitchen is excellent and well stocked, coffee maker, toaster, large fridge, regular size oven. Great to have coffee and creamer ready for arrival. The basement apartment is very spacious, with lots of room to spread out if you have more than one or two. Furniture is comfortable, and as photos. Two beds in one bedroom and one bed in the second bedroom. There is a lovely two person swing to enjoy in the evenings. If you are traveling or on a road trip, particularly if you have kids, this is a great place to stop over."

Stayed with kids","I did not feel safe here. There were no windows in the main bedroom. There were not any egress windows at all and they were very high. There was some sort of electrical cords plugged into the outlet in the main bedroom that ran underneath the carpet. I don't know what it went to, but it seemed very unsafe. There was a dirty wadded up towel in the linen closet and a used bar of soap in the shower. I don't think the bathroom was cleaned. The pillow in the main bedroom was missing a pillow case and the linen felt unwashed. It was the worst experience we've had on BnB and a disappointing way to end our vacation. We would have stayed at a hotel if we hadn't of gotten in so late. I wish I would have read through all of the reviews, because others had made comments about this. Some of the other reviews talk about a lake house. I don't think all of those reviews pertain to the house we stayed in. However, I do have to say that the host was responsive with communication via the app. We didn't meet the hosts when we got there. I am sure they are very nice people, but I wouldn't stay here or recommend it."

Group trip","I really hate to write this, as you can tell they have put a lot of work into the place and did many things to make the place inviting (like a North Platte information binder), but I would not recommend staying here, primarily for safety reasons. We had some tidiness issues (not folded towels and linens, old, misshapen pillows, dirty coffee cups) but those could have been one-off oversights or us being too picky. The main issue is the fire safety. Most critically, there is no window in the main bedroom. The other windows in this basement suite are all above your head (we didn't measure but I'd guess the sill is about 6 feet off the ground). I looked up Nebraska code and each sleeping area should have a window that is no more than 44"" off the ground and has at least 5sqft of opening for above grade openings. With the window opened they might have that 5sqft but definitely not the 44 inches above the floor. We stayed there with my elderly in-laws. I don't know if I could have heaved myself up to those windows if the need had arisen, let alone my in-laws."

The listing says that breakfast is provided at this writing, but Mary has discontinued that service. There is a grocery store close by. There are tenants in the upstairs of the house who were quiet overall, but you could hear their footsteps and their use of water/plumbing. There is an available washer/dryer in the entry way to the basement steps. We did discover the washer/dryer in use by another party during our stay. The friendly owners live next door."

The original booking in town was at least as nice as the listing indicates and I would recommend it to anyone staying in North Platte and looking for a quiet residential neighborhood. The space featured a very nice, open living room and would be epecially good for families or groups.
Mary was apologetic about the double booking but offered us her cabin on the lake five miles south of town. Though it was small for our group (6 people) the location is great, right on the lake in a quiet community. Would highly recommend this cabin for small families or anyone looking for a peaceful get away."
