Stayed about a week",We loved Cambria! And staying at Ann-Marie's! My husband especially liked the shower (we may be doing a remodel. lol) I enjoyed sun-bathing on the private deck since it was too windy and cold to lay out on the beach the week we spent there. The place is exactly as pictured and Ann-Marie would check in to make sure everything was okay. It was perfect for our first trip to California.

Stayed a few nights","We loved this place!! We are on a long road trip and this stop felt quite unique and special. It consists of a bedroom with huge comfortable bed, compact cupboard kitchenette(microwave, kettle-no stove) and large bathroom and beautiful deck overlooking fairly wild lovely garden. The large tastefully tiled shower area does not need an overhead light-plenty of light comes from the main bathroom area. There is no TV which was fine for us. The cabin room and deck is in a quiet residential area which is about 20-30min walk into central Cambria-to note this is in part down some fairly steep steps so not for everyone. Access by car very easy. Cambria is charming. Check out wild ginger takeaway. The quality cabin has a very relaxing vibe. Can highly recommend."

Stayed one night","Very well cared for and private location. Perfect place to meditate, plan and read, as well as enjoy the nature and look at the stars. We had only one night unfortunately, but would hav happily stayed for longer. It’s very relaxing.
The thing to know - it’s difficult to shower at night, as there is no light inside the shower cabin and it’s dark. However if you get used to it, I suppose you could do it.
The little inbuilt kitchen had both relaxing and energising type of teas. This is rarely what hosts think about, but Ann-Marie had it there. Very much appreciated to relax for the night.
Super soft and cozy bed too. Thank you!"

Stayed a few nights","Ann-Marie was very friendly and gave great recommendations for the area! I was working while traveling and had some issues with the WiFi dropping several times throughout my stay during meetings, which was very disruptive. Thankfully, the connection would come back quickly. The other issue I had was that the iron was dirty and leaked a yellowish white liquid. Outside of that, I had a great stay. The room was private and while it did not really have access to the yard in the photos, the back patio was very pleasant."

Stayed a few nights","Had a very peaceful stay at Ann-Marie’s place. Used the portable heater at night when it got cold and it worked great. Our stay was about a 5 minute drive to the ocean. The neighborhood is very hilly so the car was a must! Being surrounded by nature was our favorite part. Inside, there were ants by the kitchenette as Ann-Marie shared with us so we tried to keep food away from that area. Overall, enjoyed our stay!"

Stayed a few nights","Ann-Marie is truly a super Superhost. We have stayed at many AirBnB's around the world and her place is a truly lovely experience. It’s clear that she really cares about everything and that this place isn’t here just to make a buck. Everything is of good quality and immaculately clean, well maintained and very comfortable. The mattress is so nice, new and not worn out. She provides everything we could think that anyone would need and more. We were arriving late so she made sure we could easily get in and even turned on the heat for us since it was January and a bit chilly at night. The location is very close to the Hearst Castle and cute downtown Cambria. The neighborhood is very safe, secure and peaceful."

Stayed a few nights","This is a lovely in-law space in a beautiful neighborhood. The kitchenette was in the large closet (one side) which was OK except there was no running water. There was water in the bathroom but our instructions were to just leave dirty dishes if we were only staying for a few days (which we were). We had ants, which to be perfectly fair to our host, we did not say anything about. So, we just did the few dishes we had in the bathroom sink going forward and cleaned up the ants - no big deal. We would stay there again for sure."

Be aware if you visit in cold weather that there isn’t much heat in the studio. Only a small space heater that doesn’t do much. So if you’re cold natured or visiting during cold weather, you might be chilly.
Otherwise it’s a nice place with a nice owner"

Stayed one night","Ann-Marie’s studio was all we had hoped to find. It was comfortable, organized and quiet. A special treat was one of the most comfortable beds we have ever experienced when staying at many AirBnB accommodations. We were late arriving which resulted in our missing out on the truly beautiful surroundings. The morning provided a sense of what it would be like to be there for a few days. We live only a few hours away. We will be back. Regards…Wayne and Dana"

Stayed a few nights","It was a Complete Delight staying here! Turning onto the street we were surprised by a group of 10 turkeys leisurely walking towards us down the very center of the road. We let them pass and continued on , we also saw a young deer beside the road in the greenery. The Garden gate was a little hard to find, we had to make a U turn and go back for a second look. And then I saw my name on a tiny Welcome Sign on the gate. It's a lovely, quaint, restful cottage. The only thing we missed was a TV. We knew by the listing that it doesn't have one, we thought it wouldn't matter but we missed it. However , it caused us to improvise and we played some games and laughed a lot. The King, bed was very comfortable. The neighborhood is quiet and we slept well. Sitting in the 2 chairs on the wood deck gives you the feeling of being up in a treehouse. A good spot to enjoy morning coffee. Thank you for sharing your slice of paradise. 😊"

The space has beautiful woodwork and well thought out details such as luggage racks, a mini-fridge, filtered water tank, coffee and utensils. Very clean and spacious bathroom. Parking area is not right next to the entrance and has a long walkway that is well lit with path lights. Just be aware if arriving at night. Highly recommend dining at Dorn's in Morro Bay and walking the Cambria Moonstone Beach boardwalk starting at the Santa Rosa Creek parking lot on Moonstone Beach Drive."

Stayed one night","At last. This place is absolutely enchanting. It is a venture into the minimalistic heart and soul of your unseen host Anne Marie, whose intuitive and artistic presence is everywhere displayed in and around this ‘cottage in the forest’ experience. But although you may not see her, don’t for a moment think she is unavailable to respond to your concerns or comments. This place is not some kind of really nice hotel room. Its charm lies in the fact that it is in a category all its own."

Stayed one night","Ann-Marie's location is a breathtakingly sweet getaway.
The location feels so much more tucked away than it actually is in the surrounding neighborhood because this AirBnB has its own essence and substantial space. You will feel comfortable and safe here thanks to all the little accommodations that she has prepared. The shower and bathroom are large, the kitchenette includes plenty of helpful elements for a traveler, and the vibe is feminine, peaceful, and earthy.
My ONLY two minor criticisms of this nearly perfect place:
1) The bed was very soft; I personally had some trouble sleeping on it. But I'm sure it would be many people's cup of tea depending on your preferences!
2) It would have been nice to have a light for the shower; though the stonework is GORGEOUS, it was a bit awkward showering essentially in the dark.
Those are the ONLY two things I can think of. Definitely one of the finest AirBnBs I have been to, especially considering the location. Highly recommended."

It's also within walking distance of some incredible hikes/trails and just a 3-5 minute drive into town. WiFi was excellent too! I highly recommend staying here.

A large private deck overlooking a beautiful garden provides a refuge after too much beach and trail walking. Had the best night's sleep ever. The bathroom and shower is unusually large and well kept (I stay frequently in AirBnB and some of the showers are barely usable). Great location. Loved it!

And when we wanted to head into town we were just under a 5 minute drive to all the fun local spots and eats. Truly a gem to stay at, looking forward to the day we can come back! Thank you again for having us!! 😊
P.s. To anyone considering staying here, just do it. It’s absolutely a wonderful corner of heaven. ❤️"

Overall, a very nice stay and we would love to stay again."

Stayed a few nights","This place is tucked in a quiet and private neighborhood of Cambria, it's super close to trails, downtown and the beach (you can't really go wrong with Cambria as it's super tiny). Everything is 5-10 mins driving distance.
On to the basics: internet is slow, could be cold at night, but our host provided a space heater that worked perfectly. Bed - memory foam, a bit soft for me but it was fine. Our host has coffee, tea and half and half, which was very convenient. The lid of the coffee pot was not attached to the pot, so it slipped to my cup of coffee while I was pouring my coffee from the pot. Shower - unfortunately wasn't very hot, I took a shower at night and felt cold the whole time and cold after shower. I tried it again during the day and it was even colder.
Cleanliness: everything is very clean. I think the pillow may have smelled a bit of mildewy for me, I got these smells on my hair the next day.
Communication is slow. Stylish place but could use bit more care."

Stayed a few nights","Ann Marie's unit is as pictured. Nice studio with lots of windows. Very clean. Bed was comfy. Nice toiletries & little touches like a night light & kitchenette with a microwave, hot water kettle & a mini-fridge. My only issue is that the wall radiant heating unit was not enough to warm the place up likely because of the beautiful vaulted ceiling. She did address it right away when I told her after my first night & she provided me with a space heater. And then it was OK. She's very responsive & addresses any issues right away. It's about a 7-10 minute drive to Main St."

Neighborhood is lovely and quiet. The house was totally spacious and very comfortable to be in. I loved how the house was decorated. Dishes, towels, etc were stocked and great to have. I had to call Katy about a question I had and she was right there for us. The showers were new and were so great. The heater heats up the place quickly. We definitely will be back. My 14 year old daughter wants me to buy this house. I wish! Too bad we are stuck in the rat race Bay Area. Hahah! I hope everyone enjoys this house like we did. I can’t imagine anyone not.

Stayed a few nights","This is a lovely stand-alone house in the middle of a very rural residential community (probably very wealthy too) on the ocean-side of Cambria amidst pine and oak groves on the bluffs sloping down to stunning California Central Coast where you can get views of the ocean (a short walk, not directly from the property). Interior provides expansive kitchen, fully equipped, dining room and large bedrooms as described. Exterior amenities include a hot tub that works, also outdoor seating and a small wild garden to have some privacy if the weather is nice (happened to be cold when we were there). It's not convenient to restaurants, so cooking-in was the better option, and there is at least one decent-sized grocery store in Cambria across the other side of the 101 freeway. As along most of this part of the coast, the beaches are not really for swimming, but they are beautiful and wild to walk along. San Simeon and Paso Robles are short drives away. I would go again."

We stopped all along the coast of California - in beautiful scenic airbnbs and this was the most expensive place. We only booked it bc of comfortable beds & multiple adults who would like their own rooms. Not a single laundry pod or soap available - would be nice to be able to wash 1 load of laundry for $500"

After historic CA rainfall and devastating after effects across CA, Squirell’s Cottage became my retreat for a few days when my previous vacation rental heartbreakingly began taking in water. Katy was gracious with last minute accommodations at Squirrels Cottage.
It’s a great space for a couple of families, girls weekend, romantic getaway, or serenity for solo travelers."

Everything is close by yet you felt like your in the mountains and see the wild deer and turkeys along the streets then there's the beach and sand and seals! Great place to stay."

Stayed with a pet","Katy's place was absolutely amazing! It was the perfect house for several generations of family to gather, and even a couple of dogs!
The house is spacious, clean, and comfortable. The kitchen was well equipped, which made it easy to prepare meals for our group of six. The backyard is charming, and I was surprised at how much space and privacy it had. The dogs loved running around and we enjoyed starting the day with a cup of coffee in the many sitting areas outside.
The shutters on the windows blocked out nearly all light, and the beds were so cozy. There is clearly a lot of thought put into this space, and we enjoyed every minute of our time here.
Just a couple of tiiiny notes: The driveway does fit two cars, but it can be a tight fit. Wasn't a problem for us, but something to know if you have larger vehicles. We also didn't notice any separate towels for the hot tub, but luckily we had some beach towels in the car that we were able to use. We did need to make use of the washer and dryer during our time here, but we couldn't find any laundry detergent in the house. We made a quick trip to the grocery store up the road and were able to pick some up though - just something to keep in mind if you plan to use the washer!
Overall, it was a 10/10 experience and we would absolutely stay again!"

Stayed with a pet","This cottage could not have been more perfect! Location, kitchen, front porch, back porch, garden...all perfect. And our dog loved it.
So many recliners, it was hard to choose which one to nap in. The evenings were cool enough to use the fireplace.
We really took advantage of the central location, visiting from Morro Bay to Big Sur and inland to Atascadero, Templeton and Paso Robles, even though we were often so comfortable we were reluctant to leave the house.
And the weather. A beautiful mix of sun and fog.
Since we live in the Palm Springs area this was such a nice break from the summer heat.
We've been to Cambria many times over the years but this was one of the best trips ever."

A little odd not to have locks on the bathroom doors, but that was the only thing that wasn't outstanding. I would stay here with family again, no doubt."

Hot tub was very clean, but neighbors are closeby. Bring a swim suit! Cambria can get cool at night so the outdoor fireplace is good. The indoor heating system works REALLY well. House was warm in no time on cool February evenings.
Less stars on location because it was close to some other houses and Ardath Drive, which has some road noise. Still, nothing to complain about as the noise did not bother us much. Next door neighbor was playing basketball during our nap (boo hoo for us). We just moved to another room as it was just the two of us.
Plenty of room for six people to have a fun time. Third bedroom is set up for kids (2 small beds).
We will rent again when we plan our next Cambria trip."

A short walk down the street to Fiscalini trails and so close to downtown restaurants and shops. We walked some beautiful trails and were hoping to see some deer. When we got back to the house afterward the deer came to us! We opened the door to see 5 deer grazing right across the street so peacefully. Sitting on the porch watching the deer was definitely a highlight. Our dog loved staying here with us so much. He snored in front of the fireplace both days and loved laying on the porch as we drank our coffee. The hot tub was really nice to relax your muscles at the end of the day and the tree lights added pretty ambiance. The bed was huge and very comfy and the backyard is a lush oasis. Every aspect of this stay was perfect and it brought us so much joy to stay in this special home in the heart of Cambria. Thank you Katy for making it possible! We had the best stay and felt like a Christmas hallmark movie :-)

Just like other guests commented, the house is very clean, has so many different options to hang around inside the house and out in the backyard or front yard, has more than ample storage, the kitchen and bathrooms fully equipped, the entire house decorated nicely with cute animal and ocean themes. Beds we used in the two rooms were very comfy, and the reclining chairs in the living room were awesome and perfect for watching TV or socializing around the fireplace. We also took advantage of the fabulous back deck for early dinner and a breakfast and enjoyed the wild squirrels being active on the trees. The location was perfect. We decided to watch the sunset at the Fiscalini Ranch Preserve right nearby. And boy we were happy when we saw the fantastic view of the Pacific. We saw small and big dear in the neighborhood.

Two very comfortable twins as well. The front porch extends the entire length of the house--great view of the wildlife. Nice nooks to sit in backyard too! The best part is your location to everything in Cambria and being able to walk a few houses down the street to the trailhead for the Fiscalini Ranch Preserve--so many trails! The decor has it's own personality! So many fun touches! One thing to note: you are one house from a busier neighborhood street--so you will see and hear the people who leave for work in the morning as you sit on the front porch. Didn't bother me, but if you are expecting it to be very quiet, it's not. And the skylights (front porch, bedrooms, hall bath and family room) make the house feel so open! Only the master rooms doesn't have them. Great shutters on all windows for privacy when needed. All in all, I can't wait to come back here!"

The whole house is nicely furnished and the back yard is so relaxing (the hot tub helps!). As an FYI, there are no locks the bedroom doors if that's something that you might need. The house is just a couple of blocks from an entrance to the beautiful Fiscalini Ranch Preserve.... you definitely need to walk through there during your visit. We would definitely stay there again.

Fiscalini Ranch was wonderful- we want to return and are bummed it’s already almost completely booked for summer. This is the best Airbnb we have stayed in. Thank you Katy! Wonderful host! Top notch!!!!!!!"

Stayed a few nights","We really needed a break, and we sank right into this lovely home. The house is right in the charming hillside neighborhood of Cambria. It looks like a modest ranch house from outside, but inside every detail has been superlatively attended to. The kitchen is exceedingly well furnished, there are multiple TVs, and there are all kinds of places to just sit and relax. First, there is the long front porch, offering a view of passing deer and turkeys. In the enclosed back yard, there's a rustic corner with a gas stove, a gas grill, and of course, the hot tub. All three bedrooms are thematically decorated -- kids, teen, and adults. My favorite spot was the chaise lounge by the front window, where I could lie and read and keep an eye on passing wildlife. You're in a residential area, but it was very quiet. The ocean is a short drive, or a long walk, and there are lots of places to hike. When you go to town, visit the garden courtyard of stories, including the Ocean Heir shop for great books, clothes, cards, gifts, etc. Speaking of which, I loved all the mermaid, whale, squirrel, deer, etc., decorations in the house. The only reason I didn't check ""outstanding hospitality"" is because we were self-sufficient on our stay, but there was nothing we needed. My only warning is we didn't have cell phone reception. To me, that was a blessing!"

Some of our favorite things about Katy’s home include: the jacuzzi and porch out back, the huge kitchen with everything you need for cooking, the peaceful front porch, and the proximity to walking trails and downtown Cambria!
The place was spotless and checking in was a breeze. Katy was super communicative and we had no problems at all. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a peaceful, easy Cambria getaway."

Stayed a few nights","What a rollercoaster visit to Cambria and Katy's house. First the house... we loved her house! The location was beautiful and the first two mornings, I enjoyed my tea on the front porch watching the deer across the street. The perfect way to start the day! Tuesday night, a raging storm hit Cambria and a large tree fell up the block, knocking out power. I went into town to call Katy who was very responsive and sympathetic. The power never came back on so we used the fireplace to warm up and cooked dinner by candlelight. With the rain pounding the roof (and a good bottle of local wine), it was peaceful and relaxing! The next morning the power was still off so we needed to cut our stay short and head home. Katy was very gracious and refunded the last unused night which we really appreciated. Back to the house... it's just down the street from a beautiful hiking trail into the ranchlands (which we really enjoyed with our two dogs). The house has well-stocked pots, pans, plates, bowls, glasses, knives, etc., a comfortable master bed, excellent heat, a lovely gas fireplace, and a really pretty backyard (in the fun and funky Cambria style). We sat in the sun in the yard but otherwise it was too chilly to eat outside. Be sure to bring your own laundry detergent, olive oil, coffee, tea, etc. (as well as extra toilet paper if you are staying for more than a weekend) and know that cell service is almost non-existent at the house (but wifi is great -- if you have power!). Katy's house (and Cambria) was the perfect place to enjoy our first get-away since the beginning of the pandemic. Already checking her calendar for the next opening! :)"

The hot tub was SO WONDERUL! And all of it so easy to use and there were so many supplies in the kitchen. No problem with prepping a meal or having a wonderful dining experience. Wildlife just outside the front door and a large porch to die for. Hiking at the preserve just a block away. We will be coming back."

The house also had great natural light with all the skylights (none in the master bedroom which was appreciated). The other two bedrooms did have skylights. The bed was very comfortable. My 1.5 year old daughter and our dog loved the backyard and it was actually bigger than expected. Since cell reception isn’t great in the area it was nice to have working wi-fi and there was also a house phone if needed. Overall we had an amazing time and would stay here again in the future."

Stayed one night","Found Diane and Dutch's place last minute. Quite location overall, positioned off the backside of their home (not attached to main home). Had what we needed for a short 24 hour trip, however very small. If we planned to eat in we would've liked a table with chairs, had a TV tray instead. The bed was very comfortable for watching a show, but when sleeping, VERY uncomfortable. It would be WELL worth investing in a more comfortable mattress. Midway through the night we had to alternate the direction of our sleep, so we didn't feel like a taco (I am 165lbs and my husband is 175lbs, so weight should not be an issue). Also, the fire alarm went off for no apparent reason other than the shower steam (with which we had the fan on but it didn't help).
Overall, 4 out of 5 stars, and would recommend for the location, peace and quiet, friendliness of the hosts, ease of entry and exit. Bed is a definite downfall."

Location was amazing; super close to Cambria and we had a delicious dinner and breakfast treats at Linn’s restaurant and pie bakery (per the host’s recommendation). Close to highway one and many ocean vistas that are great for stargazing.
Diane and Dutch’s place was spotlessly clean, thoughtfully stocked with amenities such as K-cup pods and granola bars / road trip snacks, and the bathroom was so comfy. The porch showed gorgeous forest views as promised in the pictures, along with a cute garden that felt very relaxing to sit in. Due to the place being dark at night, would recommend arriving before dark and being a little careful pulling up into the driveway, but host was there to greet us and show us the way. 10/10 stay!"

My morning tea among the trees with butterflies floating in the trees, scrubjays drinking from the fountain, hummingbirds fluttering by and tiny wild canaries fleeting and drinking while other birds soar in the sky.

Stayed a few nights","The hosts are nice people, but I booked ""The Tree House"" for my wife and me as a base for exploring Cambria, and once we saw the space, we literally turned around and left.
The room is tiny, and there is very little privacy. There is a room for a double or queen-sized bed and MAYBE 75 sq ft of additional space.
A couple of windows in the room look right out into the host's backyard. The host's front door is just a few feet from the entrance to the ""Tree House,"" which is more of a small writing room turned into an Airbnb.
If you're staying by yourself and all you need is a bed to sleep in, the Tree House has that. And, as I said, the hosts are nice. But I don't feel the room was as advertised, and the photos make it look bigger than it is. We paid in advance, so it was just a waste of a few hundred dollars.
I felt like a first-class idiot when my wife and I saw this tiny space. Luckily, we were able to find a room at the Cambria Pines Lodge, which saved our anniversary weekend."

The front door opens onto a magical, lush natural forested hillside with lichen draped trees, and deers and turkeys ambling by. There are also some nice seating areas scattered around the multi-leveled yard/ decks which we did not have the time to enjoy but looked super comfy with spectacular views.
We stayed for 4 nights to hike the coastal areas surrounding Cambria and their place was a great home base for us with special added extras such as muffins baked by Diane and locally grown grapes (which were come of the best I’ve ever had!). It is also super close to downtown Cambria and the fantastic natural market True Earth.
The studio is surprisingly well-equipped for the size and D & D thought of just about everything to make the space a wonderful place to spend time."

Stayed a few nights","This was exactly what we needed, where we needed it for our short and busy stay. It was very clean, comfortable, relaxing and was just as described. Diane was quick to respond to my messages when I had questions and she was very friendly when I met her on our way out. Due to our short stay we were not able to enjoy all the amenities, especially the beautiful location but we are planning to book this place again for our next Cambria trip. Thank you again Diane & Dutch."

Diane and Dutch truly went above and beyond with their hospitality, providing local food/activity recommendations, convenient amenities, and seamless communication. The room is super cozy (with an incredibly comfy bed), and the location is ideal -- you're so close to everything, yet still in a private location. I would highly recommend it to anyone!"

Always responsive with local suggestions where to visit and eat and always respecting your privacy. Their treehouse guest house is perfect for any couple with small child or single person. Extremely clean and nicely decorated with calming colors. I needed to find nature offering R&R. Their guesthouse met beyond my expectations. Wild deer, wild turkeys and bluebirds were added bonuses.
In all of the Airbnb's I have stayed in, their Cambria Treehouse will always be my favorite with frequent visits (hopefully) in the future."

Great communication from start until finish, friendly, helpful, and attentive! Short walk to Christmas Market (which we highly recommend, btw), but also private, peaceful, and beautiful location (in a little wood! We even saw a deer right on the property!).
Super comfortable and convenient accommodations (highlights for me: memory foam mattress and electric fireplace heater). These hosts deserve an award for how cleverly they fit in nearly every amenity you could think of in such an efficient and artistic way (loved the nautical/beach theme!). Decorated for Christmas and provided homemade Christmas cookies and banana bread upon our arrival! Got to meet the hosts at their booth at the Xmas Market where they gave us great advice for our planned drive up the coast.
We would definitely stay here again; we highly recommend the place. Many thanks to Diane and Dutch!"

We only stayed one night but we could’ve stayed much longer and would have had everything thing we needed. Only downside was we could only stay one night. The location is great being a short walk from the main street (there are stairs but not too bad unless you have bad knees etc). Anytime we come to Cambria we will definitely try to stay here!

We remake the bed with our own bedding, bring our own towels, cover the couch, and bring plates, bowls, utensils, glasses etc. So, for me to enjoy an Air B&B, it must be as clean and maintained as this one.

Fiscalini is practically next door to the house and my main focus -- the elephant seals in San Simeon -- are just 12 minutes away. The house is small, cozy and perfect for my needs. I bring a load of stuff because I'm pedantic about grinding my coffee, having my own pillows and work chair, but the rental is very well-stocked. The bed is exceptionally comfortable, everything works as it should, and Jason is responsive.
The best endorsement is that I just reserved 7 weeks for next year."

I saw complaints about the driveway but it was not an issue at all. If you can park in a standard parking space then you’ll have no problem. Check out g**gle maps before going so you know what to expect. No problem finding the house. The side yard was perfect for the kids to play and it’s a very safe neighborhood. There’s a farmers market on Friday afternoon right in the middle of the “downtown” strip of shopping/restaurants. The house had plenty of high quality towels, sheets, blankets, etc. There’s a trick to using the door knobs but we figured it out fairly quickly. The laundry closet just outside the back door. No AC but plenty of windows for lots of air flow and a fireplace to warm up. We were able to cook meals and enjoyed meals outside on the deck."

Negatives:
House is very hard to fine, we had to do two different drive-bys to even find the house. Also, driveway is super small, my midsize SUV barely fit. Overgrown trees cover the house and the house number isn’t very visible, look for the mail box on the opposite side of the road and it’s directly across the street
The French doors were a pain to deal with especially with small children. They were easily unlocked by children and made leaving the house a pain to get them to lock."

Bed was comfy as was the couch. Had a deer visitor most mornings in the front yard & saw the wild turkeys on our walks through the forest of trees. Will definitely stay here when we return. ❤️

Stayed a few nights","Jason's place was great. Quiet, cozy and very clean. The light coming into the cabinet was fantastic. The kitchen was very clean and had everything we needed to cook a few meals and eat in.
Keep in mind the bathroom (spotless) is upstairs, which makes sense because that's where the bedroom is, but it took a little getting used to for me.
Jason was easy to get ahold of and very responsive to my inquiries. He also provided great directions to get to the local trailheads -- which are easy to walk and have incredible views!
Thank you, Jason!"

Stayed with kids","This beautiful place met our expectations. It was clean and cozy. My kids were happy to see deer welcoming us upon arrival. We walked to the Fiscalini Nature Preserve every day, to enjoy nature and beautiful views of the coast. This is the perfect spot to visit the San Simeon area/Hearst Castle/Piedras Blancas Lighthouse/Elephant seal viewpoint. The doors were a bit tricky to lock, and we didn't use the dishwasher because of a leak. But other than that, everything was fine. We enjoyed our stay a lot! Thank you, Jason!"

Stayed a few nights","Enjoyed this stay very much. Great location. We love to hike and walk and being just around the corner from Fiscalini Ranch Preserve was important to us. You can’t see the ocean from the house, but you can certainly hear it. The ocean is also within walking distance. There is plenty of heat, so no worries there! Cleanliness is super important to us and this place was very clean. Because of that, we felt very comfortable. We cook our own food and the kitchen was well stocked. We’ve already recommended this place to friends and would definitely stay again.
P.s. For those with Mint Mobile… coverage is terrible in Cambria. Thankfully, the house has great Wi-Fi"

Stayed a few nights","Jason's place is a very cute little cottage in a great location. It's a few minutes walk from the Fiscalini Ranch preserve, which is a really cool place. You can hike to the shore from the cabin through the preserve, and it's really something. The views of the ocean from the forest trails are spectacular, if you don't want to go down the hill to the coast, but I would. The coast trail is gorgeous.
The cottage itself is clean, comfortable, and well appointed. Jason was a great host. We ate at The Black Cat Bistro and Indigo Moon. Both were delicious, and they're about a five minute drive from the cottage. We would definitely stay here again."

There was a gas fireplace/heating unit in the living room that was easy to use, verty pretty to watch and very effective in heating the unit. The bathroom was pure HGTV. The bed was top quality and very comfy. There was plenty of space to stow our belongings and keep our lodging neat. The neighborhood was perfect for us.

The house is nestled in the trees on the lot and is also within walking distance of Fiscalini Ranch (a must for me!). The glass French doors are a nice touch, displaying the setting sun in the front and, if you’re lucky, deer from the back. But also there’s a wonderful front deck with comfortable chairs for feeling even closer to nature. The neighborhood is super quiet. The big master suite is upstairs and the living area downstairs, a footprint I really liked. Within a matter of minutes you can be in town where there are many excellent restaurants to choose from should you decide not to cook. Overall very comfortable and with everything I needed. I absolutely would stay here again."

During my stay, in the morning I look forward to opening the blinds. Grey fog or blue skies. The windows frame old, gnarled oak trees and evergreens. Wild turkeys and deer visit. Each evening I walk the sea bluffs and sometimes sight whales, porpoises, otters, or seals. I am a repeat guest and the hosts have always been very kind and accommodating."

Stayed a few nights","This home is wonderful. Perfect walking distance to Fiscalini. I highly recommend hiking through the area. Minutes from downtown Cambria. Expect to see deer in the yard. Though shy, they came by daily to sit beneath the shady trees in the yard. At night, you can hear the seals. I already miss it. Stop by Moonstone Beach, a short drive. Or even go see Hearst Beach/Hearst Castle-- a short 15 minute drive away.
The washer and dryer are located outside the home, in an outdoor accessible closet. Very user friendly and very useful for our stay. They provided coffee and a coffee maker. But be sure to bring sugar and creamer if that's your thing. The neighborhood felt incredibly friendly and safe. Our first morning, our neighbor came outside, collected his paper and said: ""Good morning World."" That is the essence of this area. Everyone seemed happy to be there, happy to meet you."

Stayed a few nights","We really wanted to love this place... we appreciated the communication and the cleanliness of the property; however, there were just things we couldn't get over. The driveway was really difficult to navigate. If you have a larger truck or SUV, you'll run the risk of hitting a low-hanging tree branch. Be sure to park backward. We didn't realize the bathroom was on the second level, while the laundry was outside; not mentioned the listing. There were a lot of spiders everywhere, which is probably normal for the area, but we killed at least 6-7. There was no mention of having to put the garbage cans out on the street, then bring them back in; this will happen on a Thursday. It wasn't exactly easy to get to a beach from the property either. Ultimately, the bed was extremely uncomfortable, resulting in my need to seek immediate massage therapy and be referred to a chiropractor. I wanted to love it, but it was more work and a hassle than we anticipated."

Inside it is tastefully decorated and equipped with everything that anyone could possibly need, from a giant smart TV to a very good kitchen.

The location is easy to get to, and check in is perfect — lockbox and boom, you're in. The place itself was spotless and felt new.
There are two types of places we generally get: ones that feel kinda lived in, and one that feel professionally prepared for rental. This was the second type, and I mean that in a good way. That's exactly what we wanted:
• full, nice kitchen
• nice, clean decor with extra space, because two year old
• close to extended family's house
• better value than the nicer hotels in town
This is it. PLUS the host, Jason, is friendly and professional, with quick response times even during busier periods.
In conclusion: loved it. We will check this place first when we plan our next visit."

Stayed with kids","Jason’s home is in a lovely location nestled in a quiet neighborhood with trees and nature views. We loved being a quick walk to the Fiscalini Ranch Preserve and short drive to the main part of town! The home is newer with the amenities that make a stay enjoyable - kitchen utensils, pots, pans, etc plus a little fireplace. Two things weren’t quite what I expected - I wasn’t aware that the bedroom upstairs was more of a loft-style without a door to close off the space. This was mainly a concern for me because we were traveling with our infant son and it meant we needed to be extra quiet downstairs while he slept/took naps. I also wasn’t aware that the home was heated with the fireplace/space heaters - I fully admit to not being familiar with homes on the coast so perhaps to most this is common. That being said we still had a lovely time and I would recommend Jason’s place to those wanting to visit Cambria."

It's a small, bright house that is perfect for one person or a couple. I've stayed there several times now and you won't find a cleaner, better-equipped home. Great appliances, knives and cookware, big TV with great nature channels, comfy bed, hot shower, nice garden, and quiet neighbors.
The only improvement would be a bath tub but there would be nowhere to put it :)
Thanks for another great stay, Jason."

The proximity to the Fiscalini Preserve is its best attribute and the walks through there are not to be missed. They provide sweeping views of the coast that you can walk to in a short amount of time. The trails are easy and accessible for most people, even with limited mobility.
But, even just sitting on the porch at the cottage can provide all the wildlife you need, birds, deer, squirrel and bunnies all made their way past us on the deck. A perfectly relaxing mid-term break. These city girls loved it!"

It was a strange time to visit, in the midst of the Coronavirus crisis, but there were so many things to enjoy outside without social interaction so we made it work. Great hiking just a couple blocks away, and the drive into town for food and provisions was just 6 minutes. One day I decided to walk into town, which was a beautiful 30 minute walk each way, but FYI, it does involve some hills and many stairs (but frankly, I needed and enjoyed the exercise!). Oh, and just a few feet into my walk I came upon a pack of 5 (!!) deer, which is something I'll never forget!"

Stayed a few nights","This is an exceptionally good place and the host Jason is really going the extra length to make sure that his quests really have a pleasant experience. This is my second stay at this place.
Everything is in very good condition, sparkling clean, uncluttered, convenient and tastefully in a fairly neutral style that should work for most people. The layout of the house on two floors works very well and all rooms are spacious and very well lit with lots of windows. The overall construction is modern and up to high standards with excellent thermal and acoustic insulation. The view from the front porch is to the the small garden with a beautiful oak tree. All of this is in a quiet and pleasant neighborhood frequently visited by deer.
The bedroom does guarantee excellent nights sleep: the bed is very comfortable, there isn't any noise at all and there are very effective blinds on all windows. The room is large and and welcoming with windows on three walls. There is a lot of storage space.
The bathroom is very spacious with a large walk-in shower and everything is sparkling clean and very well kept.
Downstairs is a single combined kitchen living-room. The kitchen is equipped with all the basics for cooking, including a great selection of knives and other utensils, pans, mixing bowls, baking trays, sieves, etc. There is also a selection of consumables that make life a lot easier (quality spices, oil, parchment paper, cling film, etc.). The place isn't really designed for heavy duty cooking as there isn't any kitchen hood. Also, if you are planning anything requiring more specific equipment, it might be better bringing it with you (I don't think that there is any food processor, whisk, juicer, etc.).
On top of that, Jason is clearly committed to making sure that his guests have the best experience. In the unlikely situation where something doesn't work as expected, Jason will promptly address the issue in ways that anyone would find impressive.
Last but not least, this property is in Cambria with easy access to its wonderful coastline, great landscape and fascinating wildlife."

The only downside is that the town has a some sort of ordinance against street parking for AirBnB and hotel guests. Jason gave me a call after hearing from a neighbor who complained about two of our cars parked outside. We moved the cars down the street (which wasn’t terrible), but it was a bit of a hassle. Would ultimately recommend the AirBnB overall though! Just try to stick to one car that fits in the drive way."

There is a nice deck, 2 comfy chairs, & a great view for lounging with morning coffee or an evening glass of wine. We really enjoyed the trees, wildlife, & star gazing from those chairs! The Fiscalini nature preserve trailhead is right around the corner and offers beautiful hiking that leads from the forest to the ocean. It is a monarch butterfly haven. We did 3 trails and wished we had time for more! Moonstone beach is a short 6 min drive and downtown Cambria is just across the main road. It’s an adorable town with great restaurants, shops, & antique stores. This location was perfect for us to explore the entire area. We can hardly wait to return!

Stayed with a pet","Staying at this Cambria gem was an absolute delight! The house was not only spacious and immaculately clean but also conveniently a three minute drive to the heart of town, making it the perfect getaway spot.
From the comfy bedrooms to the well-appointed kitchen, every detail was thoughtfully curated for a comfortable stay. The host Diane, was also very helpful!
I highly recommend this lovely retreat and give it a glowing 5-star review!"

We rent a lot of air bnb’s and my wife thought this was the cutest one of all. You can’t tell from the pictures but one of the chairs is a recliner which we were happy about. The yard is huge and secure for our chihuahuas. The last day we were there it rained like crazy and part of the town had to be evacuated due to flooding, this home is up on a small hill and had zero flooding issues. Diane had heard about the weather and personally called to make sure we were ok. She was very nice and we hope to stay here again."

Stayed with kids","WOW!!! A 100 out of 10!!! What a great experience Diane provided for our family. We stayed during the Christmas season, and had our toddler twins with us to see the lights at the Cambia Pines Lodge.
The house was decorated for the holiday season, and was IMMACULATELY clean. Not only was it fully stocked for live-in/eat-in, there were special little touches everywhere. I can't image what this house looks like outside the holiday season, but knowing what we know, Diane has a special place for any guest to stay ANY time of year.
Everything you might have forgot and/or need, Diane has you covered. I really could not get over how perfect the house was. Simple things like coffee and sugar, olive oil, and other cooking items (remember we have twins toddlers, we aren't going out to eat anywhere), to loads of towels, shampoo/soap, flashlights by the bed. It was as if I was already at home. Let's not forget the selection of books/DVDs and board games available! WOW! Maybe one of the most thoughtful things Diane included was little signage on the items like the fireplace, or faucets, so you didn't have to guess how they worked. I just adored the attention to detail, and couldn't be more appreciative of how easy Diane made it for us to travel.
Within walking distance to the downtown area if you are relatively capable, otherwise, a very short 2-3 minute drive. Morro Bay is a quick 20-30 minutes down the coast, and there is an outdoor seal colony (way cooler than Moonstone Beach IMO) about 10 minutes away. Yes, Moonstone Beach and the Nature Preserve are also super close, as are most things in Cambria. Paso wineries are a quick 30 minutes over 46. An easy peasy drive that offer a stop on the way into, or out fo Cambia.
Just a perfect little get away. Thank you so much Diane!!!!"

The cottage include everything one would need to get out of the grind of your normal day life. A GREAT place to decompress and leave the stress behind.
We will never forget our stay at such a beautiful home. Cambria is a gorgeous coastal town and this cottage is minutes from everything. From downtown to the beautiful beaches from moonstone to ragged point.
Thank you Diane for hosting and sharing your home with us. We will 100% be coming back to unwind again.
Robert and Sarah"

Stayed with kids","Our stay at the Wine Down Cottage was lovely! Diane is a very attentive host, and responded to all inquiries in a timely manner. She even checked in with us during the week to make sure everything was ok! The house is very comfortable, and has a very well stocked kitchen- there is even an air fryer and an electric teapot. The house set up was great for our small family of 3, with the two bedrooms at opposite ends of the hall. The backyard off the master is a little private oasis! The house was very clean, and the windows were left open between renters, so we felt very safe and comfortable in these Covid times. The location of the house was great- both the beach and downtown were easy drives. We also appreciated the restaurant tips and Cambria information that was left for us. No complaints from us!"

It is totally fenced so you don’t have to worry about them getting out. The 2 fire pits are a nice touch and the hot tub is amazing. We sat in it each night looking up at the stars. We did not use the grill but there is a nice one available. All the appliances are super nice and the master bathroom has a fabulous shower. It’s definitely a place we will return.

We spent a lot of time in the hot tub, which is always hot and was large and set in a cozy part of the huge back yard. The neighborhood was peaceful and a short walk through the Cambria Pines Lodge to the stairs down to the village for a delicious lunch at Linn’s. Diane was very prompt and friends when responding to communications. I have no hesitation in recommending this comfortable home."

Spending time in the jacuzzi and enjoying drinks around the fire pit in the backyard was definitely the highlight of my trip. I would recommend Diane's home for a small family or two couples. Her home was extremely clean and Diane responded quickly to all messages.

The home has everything you need if you prefer to cook and stay in. However, downtown is super close if you choose to go out. There’s a Inn across the street. I saw they have a spa for facials and massage but I think because of COVID the spa was still closed. There’s also wild turkeys walking the neighborhood and that was fun.
Highly recommend Wine Down Cottage if you stay in Cambria!"

Additionally the level of cleanliness was superb! In this day and age it truly makes a difference knowing you’re walking into a sparkling clean rental and Diane did not miss that mark. We would go back and stay in this home again without any question. Only about a 20 minute walk from downtown Cambria or a less than five minute drive. We hit up all of the local beaches and Stolo winery; again less than 5 miles away for all activities. Truly a central location she has! Thank you Diane for making this home very cozy and comfortable for us. We can’t wait to stay here again on our visit to Cambria!

PS, it is next to a fire station, but there were zero noise issues, and the only reason we even knew they were there is because my son went running to the window to yell and wave every time he saw them drive by. :D"

Stayed about a week","The Wine Down Cottage is a beautiful place to stay and having a large fenced-in yard for our three golden retrievers was a bonus. The house is beautifully decorated and updated; we loved the wood-look tile floors.
I was concerned about the fire station right next door, but I NEVER heard a siren (when the truck leaves, it doesn't have the siren on). That being said, the street is busier than I expected, as it's a shortcut from the highway to the East Village of Cambria. We also occasionally heard partiers from the Cambria Pines Lodge, which is practically kitty corner from the cottage. The master bedroom is in the back of the house and we never heard anything when we were in the back. The ceiling fan in the bedroom was wonderful and so quiet!
It was nice to have the hot tub already ""on"" and hot and ready for a soak at a minute's notice.
The kitchen has everything you need, including spices, herbs, and even a crock pot!
The location is perfect; it's just minutes from East Village Cambria (a few minutes more to West Village), Fiscalini Ranch, 10 minutes to San Simeon (our preferred beach for the dogs), and 10-15 minutes to Hearst Castle. We took day trips to Paso Robles and Morro Bay, which are both only about 30 minutes away. Just a perfect location. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here (our first time to Cambria!) and can't wait to return."

We found the cottage to be light and airy with a great sea breeze color scheme. Enjoyed the jacuzzi under the stars. Walking the neighborhood early in the morning, we enjoyed deer sightings, horses and a few bunnies.
Highly recommend a wind down at the Wine Down"

As soon as we opened the door to this two bedroom cottage we felt at home. The owners have given a lot of attention to detail and have really succeeded in making this a comfortable and inviting atmosphere.

The home is well laid out; providing private bathrooms/bedrooms for two couples and a convivial open common area for a leisurely breakfast in the morning and relaxing conversation in the evening.

The house is well situated; just minutes up the street from Cambria village. This is a stunning part of California. We had fun exploring the beautiful beach and valley areas of Cambria.

It was the perfect place to meet up with our son and future daughter-in-law and share a special weekend together!"

Stayed a few nights","The Carriage house was just a perfect place to celebrate our 2nd wedding anniversary.
Allison made it very easy for our arrival with quick responses to questions we had as it was a very last minute trip so we did not get all the check in details via email because of our late booking.
As soon as we walked in the door to the house, we were impressed with the quaint and coziness of the home. We were greeted with a handwritten note from Allison welcoming us.
The bed had beautiful linens with a perfectly fluffy down filled duvet that I hope to replicate now that I’m back home.
The kitchen was stocked with everything needed to cook while we were there, Allison was even kind enough to leave coffee pods and cream for us.
The bathroom was equally as clean with cute decor and an amazingly big shower.
The quiet exterior made for a great nights sleep.
We hope to make it back soon as we were not quite ready to go home.
Thank you for letting us enjoy your Carriage House

She always answered my questions immediately and made sure we had everything we needed during our stay. We were even greeted by deer during our breakfast! Not sure if Allison had anything to do with that - but it made our stay even more special. This is a gorgeous spot - the photos can't really capture its loveliness. We'll definitely be back.

Stayed a few nights","From day one of the booking, Maria provided all the information needed for a relaxing stay. Her beautiful home is located in a quiet neighborhood, a quick walk to the ocean and hiking in Fiscalini Ranch Preserve. Her home has everything you need. I have never stayed at a home with such a well stocked kitchen. So many like new pots and pans. Many spices, olive oil and fresh ground coffee. Huge fridge and freezer. The towels were super absorbent and soft. The bed firm but not hard.
The front deck has a nice view of the ocean and is a perfect spot to sip some champagne. There are plenty of books to choose from for a little relaxed reading on the comfy couch or games to play if you are so inclined. It’s a very well appointed home. Recommend it highly and we will be back."

Even had 3 options for making coffee which was a plus as we love pour over & french press! The king mattress was extremely comfortable as were the linens. The living room sofa's were also very comfy after a long day of hiking.
The walk to the beach was minutes away as was the the preserve which made it great to watch the sunsets every night and not have to get in a car.
We highly recommend this property and plan on returning in the future."

We loved the location just a block back from the sea with wonderful sea views. It is right next to a park with lovely cliff walks and forest walks. There is a small town a couple of miles away with a great selection of restaurants and gift shops. We took a trip to see the elephant seals a few miles up the coast, and also visited a local winery. This airbnb rental is one of the best we have stayed in. We would love to go back some day 🙏."

The host - Maria - was super responsive and answered all of my questions. She has amazing knowledge of the area and made plenty of great recommendations. We stayed at the house over 4th oh July and thanks to her we had an amazing time watching the fireworks above the ocean surrounded by the most beautiful nature scenery! And the best thing was, we just walked from the house with the beach chairs (also provided).

You can see the ocean from the front and back decks, and we enjoyed the short walk down the street to explore the beautiful rocky beach.
The house is also very close to Hearst Castle (worth a visit) and excellent dining and shopping options in downtown Cambria."

The house is pretty, peaceful, super clean (how is it possible to be THAT clean?!), and comfortable. So many windows, and the views are breathtaking. Really enjoyed the quality kitchen - enough to meet all of our needs but not so much that finding the right tools was a hassle. Every cabinet is labeled quite specifically, so that helped make mealtime prep easier. The beds are comfy too. Maria, herself, is a top-notch host; responsive, cheerful, hospitable, and enthusiastic for her home and her guests. And... it is located in the prettiest place on earth with amazing trails that hug the coastline nearby. If you are a nature enthusiast, this is your place!"

As in they had a proper location for their HVAC unit (yes, I'm that particular since I've learned so many Airbnb houses decide to have them right next to the bedrooms and/or actually in the bedrooms often creating a wind tunnel that sounds like I'm sleeping next to a jet propulsion lab). The furnishings were all spot on and honestly, you can't find a more welcoming host than Maria. I loved all the clear labels and directions. Even check out was simple, which was a relief with two little girls, getting out of the house in the morning is always a bit chaotic. Thank you again Maria for our lovely stay!"

We were pleasantly surprised to find thoughtful touches like extra blankets, a chess board, beach chairs, powdered creamer for tea or coffee, and a room fan. The location could not be better - 6 minutes from Cambria downtown and Moonstone Beach and 12 minutes to Hearst Castle. You can also walk down to the beach (a continuation of Moonstone Beach??) right from the house and the view of the ocean from the deck is just lovely. We absolutely can't wait to come back."

Stayed with kids","This home is a gem and a must if you’re visiting Cambria. It’s a short walk to the Fiscalini Ranch Preserve where we spent almost everyday on the glorious bluff trail. The upstairs living area was full of natural light and had just an overall great vibe. The incredible kitchen was large, super clean and open to the living area so we saved money by cooking and enjoying our meals with an ocean view. The two main bathrooms were large and clean and there’s a cute third bathroom adjacent to the kitchen. The master bedroom was bright and roomy with a walk-in closet. The two bottom bedrooms with queen beds were perfect for our two, teenage sons. They loved having this own rooms for the first time! You’re bound to see deer in your front and backyard everyday. I wouldn’t advise letting children going in the backyard at all, it’s really for the local deer to graze and rest. When we wanted to go outside we just sat on the front and back outside patio decks. The laundry room is terrific! In terms of basic amenities, we really did have everything we needed. All the cabinets in the kitchen and bathrooms are labeled with all the things you might need and everything was super easy to locate. If you plan on doing lots of cooking as we did, I would bring aluminum foil, Pam spray and parchment paper. Pots, pans, baking sheets etc. were all provided by our gracious host. We loved this home so much, I’m not sure we can wait until next summer to go back!"

Interior is a little bit outdated but well maintained and clean. Despite the fact that you shouldn’t watch TV while on vacation, the TV was mounted too high up over the fireplace putting your neck at an awkward angle unless you lie flat on the couch. Maria did an excellent job communicating with us and even let us in the house 2 hours earlier because the cleaning crew was already done. I can imagine going back there with more family members as the living room is great for hanging out and having dinner."

Next time we're in Cambria, I plan on staying here again :))"

Stayed a few nights","The home was amazingly comfortable, very clean, well kept, with creatively perfect decor throughout. We loved waking up & seeing the ocean views from the bedroom. Views of the ocean & surrounding nature from every room. Loved our morning coffee/breakfast and sunset dinners out on the deck. The perfect place to unwind around the wonders of nature and seascape. Well stocked with all the amenities we needed. The bed was extremely comfortable & cozy. The enormous theatre style TV was perfectly set up in the living room to enjoy while lounging. Corner gas fireplace/heater provided warmth and ambience to the space. Excellent Wifi, easy parking access, & so much MORE! Would love to come back to The Overlook Cambria.
Thank you Lisa! You're our #1 Best Host, EVER!"

Details, such as parking, etc. are well addressed. Lisa scheduled a cleaning midway through our two week stay, much appreciated and the cleaning was spectacular.

The kitchen facilities were a bit limited if you like to cook. A two burner electric cook top, no measuring spoons. Microwave and coffeemaker were adequate. Finally, the mattress was not as firm as we prefer.
Overall, we were very satisfied with our stay!!"

The views and natural light are spectacular. Everything mentioned on the listing is present. They even have a charger next to the bed which was awesome since I always seem to forget that. Our daughter (3) years loved the place as well. It’s a 2 min drive into town. Theoretically walkable just a trek back up the hill. The kitchenette doesn’t feel that way. It feels like a fully functional kitchen with all the additional appliances.

Property is perfectly set up inside and out. Waking up to pink clouds at sunrise and a view out over the ocean from in bed is a dream! Outside patio is expansive and gives lots of extra living space. (Has great patio furniture too!)
I came for the Cambria Christmas Market and walked short distance into town to catch the free shuttle. Also walked from the townhouse to Moonstone Boardwalk. You can drive if you want, but I loved the flexibility to be able to walk and enjoy more of the town. Did a holiday lights tour of Hearst Castle as well and just 10 minute drive north. Truly a perfect trip. So much to do in Cambria. Lisa had great maps and magazines of activities as well. The home is incredibly comfortable and relaxing."

Lisa, the contact for property, is very responsive and wants to make the stay perfect for her guests. The place was spotless. The furnishings were beautiful in design and so comfortable, especially the king bed in the owners suite. Kitchen was fully stocked with all we needed to have a dinner cooked in. My two favorite things in the whole place were the expansive balcony out the back with views of the ocean and local community and the living room gas fire place. When I come back to Cambria, I will make sure to reserve this place. Perfection in Cambria!"

Stayed about a week","We had a wonderful stay at The Overlook in Cambria! The apartment is spacious, spotlessly clean, super comfortable, and the views are even better than the photos. It's an ideal location for getting into town, to the beach, or exploring along Highway 1 or farther inland. Loved the balcony especially -- the perfect spot to relax and watch the sunset. Lisa has taken such care with the unit and it really shows.
The only thing to note is, as others have mentioned, this is the bottom floor of a two-story unit and the walls are thin. We stayed for a week and the upstairs guest during that time was quiet -- it wasn't a problem. However our last night, new guests arrived who were very loud -- kids running until well after we'd have liked to have been asleep, and adults whose conversations (shouting) we could hear word for word. So it's a roll of the dice, depending on who you overlap with. We loved our stay but it would have been a different story had we arrived when we were leaving."

Stayed a few nights","The “Overlook” is up in the hills of Cambria with an outdoor terrace spanning the length of the townhouse that boasts a lovely view of the Moonstone Beach coast and the areas below. It is private and quiet. The decor has a Mid-Century Modern feel, coordinated with warm colors and nice textures. No luxury was spared - Lisa thought of everything! The bathroom is divided, making it easy and convenient for 2 people to use at the same time. The shower was huge with good, strong water pressure. There is ample storage (& hanging hooks!) throughout the unit and plenty of seating, including a desk. Just a beautiful place to stay! Highly recommend booking it.
Our only regret is that we didn’t stay longer, 2 nights was not long enough to explore this idyllic little town with restaurants, shopping and things to do aplenty!
Thank you, Lisa."

Stayed a few nights","Lisa’s place is just like the photos. The views are nice, the place is very clean and comfy, and the amenities a plus. It’s in a prime location too.
I didn’t know the upper floor would be occupied by someone other than Lisa. I do have to say that I was not expecting there to be as much noise as there was from those staying above us. With that being said, we could hear almost every foot step (which sometimes shook the dishes). I let Lisa know after their conversations were becoming louder as well. The conversations were quieter but the loud foot steps persisted.
I came to the Airbnb for some quiet time and unless i was watching tv to drown it out or stayed outside, we could hear a lot from above. Also, the smells of strong cooking came through the door as well, so just an fyi it might fill the unit you are in for a while unless you open the windows. Just keep that in mind since this is a downstairs unit."

The neighborhood is nice, and we enjoyed going to some very good restaurants in Cambria. The apartment is a great location from which to visit Hearst Castle and the elephant seal beach. We also enjoyed going down to Los Osos and Morro Bay to see harbor seals, whales and sea otters. Lisa responded quickly to questions and had some good suggestions for us. We would definitely stay with Lisa again!"

There is a kitchen where you can cook meals on a stove, but no oven. Bedroom was warm and bed was comfy. The blinds were a hassle to untangle and was difficult for us figuring out how to fully cover the window. Local to a bunch of places to eat, gas station, convenience store, etc. 10/10 stay would recommend to anyone visiting Cambria!"

Stayed a few nights","Lisa's place is so wonderful! It is really comfy and cozy, with lots of soft blankets to wrap in for sea-gazing from the incredible balcony. Our 13yo daughter slept on the pull out couch and we were able to make it really comfortable with the linens and blankets provided. The kitchen is well stocked and the shower is terrific. There was a pod coffee maker but we were happy to find a good ol' drip coffee maker in the cabinet, definitely our preference. So nice to have options! We loved walking down the big hill into town, and loved knowing we were getting a good workout walking back up the hill. :)
Overall our stay was really wonderful. We were a little surprised at how much we could hear the footsteps and conversations upstairs, but we were traveling with a tower fan and that white noise definitely helped."

Easy, quick drive from the unit to the cute town of Cambria (both sides) and the ocean is right across the highway. Parking was plentiful and free everywhere we went.

Lisa is great to deal with. She was very accessible to answer our questions about places to eat, wine to taste and things to do. All were great suggestions. While we were staying there, she usually responded to emails within minutes. She is a wonderful host.

Stayed a few nights",The Overlook had a great view and had a very modern design. The space was very clean and comfortable. One the minor issue during our stay was that the footsteps from a small child were very audible from the unit above (which is also rented for Airbnb). I don't think this is usually an issue - Lisa helped communicate with the other guests but unfortunately there's little anyone can do to manage the noise transmission. Other we had a great stay!

Loved the shower with rain shower head.
Lisa the host was the best communicator host we have experienced thank you!
Note to others: bring warm layers as the unit can be chilly. At this writing, the protocol to increase heat is to contact Lisa as temperature is remotely controlled. We loved the extra snuggly blankets and pillows while reading etc."

And the space itself was bright, well styled, and comfortable with an expansive deck and ocean views that far exceeded what we expected from the photos. You could even see the ocean lying from bed. And on our second night there, we spotted 6 different whales migrating south as the sun was setting!

Parking is easy and check in so convenient . Nice private entrance. We loved using the apt as a base for exploring neighboring Paso Robles wineries , day hikes and walks south at Morrow bay , local walks and hikes at Moonstone beach and Fiscallini preserve and elephant seal watching up north a few miles . Many fabulous restaurants downtown and bakeries and coffee shops . Can’t wait to go back and stay longer . Thank you Lisa"

It will be hard to tear yourself away from the gorgeous deck -- with its ocean vista surrounded by Spanish moss -- ideal for morning coffee and evening wine, as the sunset paints a dramatic sky.  And, yet, you will also be drawn inside to the space's inspiring mid-century decor, cozy corners, and thoughtful details throughout.  Just down the road are an array of adventures to explore -- from eats and antiques on Main Street to hikes through the Fiscalini Preserve to strolls along Moonstone Beach.  The Overlook is truly the perfect home base, and Lisa and Jerry are the most gracious hosts. "

Tons of seating. Sounds of traffic from below. Keep eyes open for scrub jays, deer, turkeys. Fab ocean view especially. Keyless entry makes it easy (no keys to forget!)."

Stayed about a week","The OverLook Cambria was aesthetically pleasing with a nice view of the ocean. It is in a great location for walking to the West Village and if you are a distance walker, to the beach. Take note: Amazon Prime Video, Netflix are for subscribers only."

Stayed a few nights",Lisa’s place was wonderful. We really enjoyed or first visit to Cambria and Lisa’s house was the perfect place to stay while there. It was warm and inviting and the porch was perfect for sitting out on and reading or watching the sun set. We would gladly have stayed there longer.

Stayed a few nights","The Overlook was such an amazing place to stay. Nestled in the trees, it was private and tranquil. Checking in was quick and easy. The home was so cozy and comfortable and full of everything we needed. The views from the deck were breathtaking. We loved every moment spent in the home. Asides from the quaint cute town of Cambria and the beautiful beach the home was the highlight of our trip. We hope to return again one day. Thank you for having us!"

Stayed a few nights","The OverLook at Cambria is truly a tranquil and lovely space, thoughtfully and lovingly furnished by Lisa and Ben. We spent a lot of time on the expansive deck, smelling the pines, admiring the ocean views and listening to the birds. Clean space, easy communication, and well-equipped with pretty much everything one would need to have a comfortable stay.
Thank you, Lisa and Ben!"

Stayed a few nights","Great weekend stay at The Overlook!
The apartment was clean, comfortable, and the views were absolutely beautiful.
The apartment itself is very quiet and the location is within walking distance to all of the attractions on Main Street as well as very walkable to the beach as well as the Fiscalini Ranch Preserve, if you're up for a longer trek.
Overall, I would highly recommend staying at The Overlook!"

Their place is conveniently located centrally to the very beautiful and quaint town of Cambria and the view from their deck is spectacular. The decor is just tasteful and appealing, cozy, and inviting. Highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","We had a good stay at the overlook. I appreciated that the guest bed was made in the living room upon arrival. The unit is tastefully appointed and thoughtfully laid out. We were chilly the first night but there is a space heater to use. The large outside deck faces both highway 1 and the ocean so you do get some road noise but when the mist clears, the beach is in view. We enjoyed sitting outside on the deck and it’s a plus for this airbnb. The small kitchen/ kitchenette allows one to cook some simple meals but will be difficult for more elaborate cooking, as we discovered when trying to make dinner. Something to note is the upstairs is occupied and there is very little sound insulation so they could probably hear us as we could hear them. The upstairs occupant’s deck is right above the Airbnb’s deck so at times it did not feel very private. The host was very responsive and that was helpful and appreciated-thanks for the stay!"

Stayed about a week","Lisa and Jerry's place is amazing! Spotless, tasteful, and comfortable - a treat for the senses! All the special touches are perfect. They are gracious and kind hosts - excellent communication and helpful - they are available if you have questions or need anything, but not intrusive. The location of the Overlook is wonderful! The deck has a stunning view and is perfect for morning coffee and/or an afternoon glass of wine - stargazing too - I even saw the lunar eclipse! The Overlook is an ideal home base from which to explore the gorgeous Central coast - north and south you can't go wrong. When I first started researching and planning my week getaway, the Overlook was a wee bit out of my budget but after looking at the photos I decided to go for it - it is worth every penny! - I will stay again in a heartbeat!"

Stayed a few nights","This is probably the best Airbnb I've had the pleasure to visit. Perfect location for frequent visits to downtown Cambria or the beach. Very comfortable living space, and large deck with lots of furniture for relaxing. Gorgeous view of Moonstone Beach as well. Just a great place to relax and enjoy your time on the coast. Nicely stocked kitchenette for simple breakfast and lunch for a break from eating out (not that you would want to! So many yummy food options near by) It does get a tad cold at night, but host had 2 space heaters and lots of blankets available and it was very cozy to sleep with the heater on. Such friendly owners who we saw in passing, but had short, lovely interactions with as we came and went. 10/10!"

Stayed a few nights",This place is amazing. Ben and Lisa are very responsive and made for great hosts. The apartment itself is very chic. Very spacious and styled amazingly. The kitchenette is also sufficient for simple meals. The entire place is great but the view is something else. We spent many hours on the deck just taking in the views. The pictures don’t do justice to the view. We’ll be back here soon. A great place to just relax over a weekend. The location is also great for other activities.

Stayed a few nights","Recently remolded, this place has many exceptional amenities, Nespresso espresso maker (which used a lot) huge shower, high quality bedding, blankets, pillows and towels. That is just a few in the beautifully decorated and modern space. The view is fantastic, and you can sit out on the huge deck to enjoy it. There is nice outside living room furniture, as well as a table and chairs if you would like to eat outside. The hosts are extremely nice and gave us great suggestions for restaurants, wineries, and activities. I look forward to our return."

Cambria is a hidden gem, great beach and quaint local shops. I hope to visit again!"
