Stayed one night",Kevin was VERY responsive. The home was nice and very clean. Room was very basic and plain. If all you're doing is stopping in for a sleep this is great. If I was staying for more than 1 night I would have liked to have a nightstand between the beds and maybe a small table in the corner with a chair or 2. Beds were soft (too soft for my husband but ok for me). Overall was great for a few hours of sleep.

Stayed a few nights","We loved our stay! Kevin was responsive, friendly and made the whole process easy. The location is great — a nice, quiet neighborhood with close access to restaurants and shopping.
Kevin’s place was clean and the mattresses were really comfortable. We appreciated that there were block-out curtains too. We slept really well.
With this being in the basement of a shared space, we did hear our upstairs neighbors during sleeping hours, but we simply turned on a white noise maker to resolve the issue.
Definitely recommend!"

Stayed one night","Definitely the BEST place I’ve stayed in a while. The single room had the most comfortable beds and carpet I’ve ever experienced at an AirBnB/Hotel (not exaggerating) and the hosts were seriously so accommodating and kind. I could not recommend this room ENOUGH. I’m so glad we chose to crash here instead of anywhere else.
The room had it’s own locked door and private bathroom and the house was super quiet! The blinds kept the room super dark and the brand new TV had everything you could need!
Side Note: We were headed to a wedding the next morning and the hosts proactively offered to go BUY an iron early in the morning if we needed one. They seriously went above and beyond in every way."

No refrigerator, microwave or coffee pot to use. Needs to be a table between the twin beds. No fan but could open the window for fresh air. He did invite us to breakfast at 9a but we chose to get on the road."

The space was very clean and location was super convenient. Walmart is 15 mints drive and nearest gas station is like 5 minutes distance. good overall location to explore SE Idaho and NPs in Wyoming. The bathroom is shared and shower is bit tiny but it's doable.

Stayed a few nights","Cons: Jay and Sandra were slow to respond on the AirBNB app and their phone number listed was incorrect. I arrived plenty after the check-in time and the hosts were not home. Typically, this isn’t an issue with most AirBNBs as most tend to have a keypad lock, but this one was a regular lock to which we had no key for access until after we were let in. I was not aware of this situation before check-in. I messaged the hosts an hour and a half prior to arrival as well.
Pros: Jay and Sandra were very welcoming, and the breakfast they offered was delicious (especially the strawberry jam). The bed was *very* comfortable!"

Stayed a few nights","First of all this is a beautiful home in a lovely neighborhood. Spotlessly clean, wonderful communication with the host who were to be out when we arrived, private room with bathroom in a private area of the home, and delightful, down to earth, really enjoyable hosts.
The area of the home we had was extremely large with a wonderful comfortable bed. There is a large seating area with even an area for children to play. This was perfect for us as a couple but would be a wonderful home for a family too.
This would be a home and hosts we would love to stay at their home whenever in Rexburg."

Stayed one night",Perfect description of place as written in the ad. We booked because instabook was available…. But unfortunately Jay and Sandra were out and didn’t check their texts or calls from us so the house was dark upon our 830 pm arrival- tgey arrived around 915 when we informed them of who we were! . I think this is a one off for them- and other than that it was so perfect for us to have the extra beds in room etc! This was our first time using instabook and likely won’t again… but would return to this room!

Stayed one night","Very nice hosts. Nice place. Nice neighborhood close to campus. We've stayed in some other AirBnB basement rentals which have had separate entries and doors that separated the basement from the upstairs so we kind of assumed that going in. However there wasn't a separate entry for us nor a door that separates the basement area from the upstairs. The host also mentioned there was another lady renting one of the other bedrooms there in the basement and that we probably wouldn't see her - and we didn't. So not quite the same feeling of privacy as we've had with other basement rentals. Again, a very pleasant place to stay with warm and gracious hosts."

Stayed a few nights","The room was comfortable and spacious with a bathroom right next to it. The hosts were nice, polite, and helpful, though at the same time they asked some odd questions and seemed slightly suspicious of us, which felt uncomfortable. They were kind to let us use their kitchen and store food in the fridge as well as do laundry. The house is large and new and located in a nice neighborhood. The location has convenient access to Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks, about 2 hours away from each, and is a great place to stay without paying the high prices of the gateway communities. The room was clean, and though the cleanliness of the kitchen and bathroom suffered a bit, it was OK. Overall it was great value for the price."

Stayed one night","Location is amazing,
Sandra and Jay were very kind to offer breakfast
Place was clean
We found beds to be uncomfortable, smaller ones wobble a-lot.
Although it was a shared unit, the bathroom had no locks and had ants moving around.
The room is in the basement.
The only way to checkin is to call Jay.
Response on airbnb messaging platform was negligible.
Reading reviews one can definitely say that Jay and Sandra are very kind people. The host came to the room to ask for breakfast without any notice..although the gesture was great but we got little scared with no sense of privacy.
I cannot deny that Jay and Sandra are amazing people , and i hope the feedback is taken constructively."

The beds were comfortable and their home was very clean. They prepared a tasty breakfast for us, including toast made with homemade wheat bread and apricot freezer jam. They even grind their own flour! Their home is just a few short minutes away from the Rexburg Temple which was the reason for our visit. Jay and Sandra were very quick to respond to the questions I had before our trip regarding road conditions in the area in the winter. They were gracious hosts and we will definitely stay with them the next time we’re in town!"

Stayed a few nights","I would have to agree with all the past reviews...Jay and Sandra are delightful! We had such an enjoyable stay with them. And as so many others have commented, the breakfast was the highlight of the stay! Not just the most delicious food each morning, but the chance to become acquainted with Sandra and Jay and the other guests. That feel of a true bed and breakfast that is no longer so available. The wheat was freshly ground the morning of our first breakfast to make delicious whole wheat blueberry muffins. Eggs and sausage. Fresh fruit. Whole wheat bread. Just such a treat!
The location is fantastic! I don’t think I could have found a better location. Just a few minutes from the temple and the university. Plenty of parking. Located on a quiet, pretty street. Our room was great! Exactly what we needed! I am so pleased to have discovered Sandra and Jay and their home. I hope to stay here often in the future. Thank you!!"

Stayed one night","The room is actually one of the two rooms in the basement.When I checked in, the other room was occupied by an American mother with her children, and it felt a little strange that they would pass my door when they went in and out.And the door is not locked, not steady!But this is the custom in the United States, the door inside the house is not locked.
The two families share a bathroom, and the bathroom is small and poor, although the owner offers to use the bathroom upstairs, I think that it is basically not used.
The owner is a Mormon, provides breakfast and participates in their prayer ceremony, as a tourist or a good experience, the owner also sent a book about Mormonism as a gift."

Stayed a few nights","Great place. Clean, plenty of space and very peaceful neighborhood. Used it as a stopover point in our way to yellow stone and Grand Teton. Reasonable driving time to both. The host was very responsive to any queries and checkin/checkout was very smooth. One thing to improve is that the listing states a maximum of 8 people but if you have more than 6, you will need spare bedding/linen. There was a 20$ charge per person (after 6 people) which wasn’t on the listing."

It was very clean and we really enjoyed our stay. We had most everything we needed right there in the house. Check in was very clear and easy, and communicated when we checked in. We will definitely be looking to see if Kaitlyn's place is available when we go back to visit!"

Walking distance to some great restaurants (be sure to check out Righteous Slice pizzeria), Porter Park, and BYUi Campus. We would definitely stay here again! For those not familiar with Porter Park, it is a great city park featuring toys and a really great splash pad for younger children. It also has a walking path, tennis and basketball courts, and even a carousel (all activities free except a small cost for the carousel). Be aware that the unit we stayed in is located on the third floor, but there is a nice elevator in the central part of the complex if needed for getting heavier bags, etc. up to the third floor."

The only downside is that the kitchen counter was a bit cluttered with plants, which forced me to adjust my eating location, but this is such a minor nitpick that it's not worth taking a star off the overall rating. This will almost definitely be my first choice if I come through Rexburg again."

Stayed a few nights","My daughter and I needed a bed to sleep in for two nights, so this was a great budget-friendly option. We really were only there to sleep, so we only saw one guy who lived there for just a minute a couple of times, but he was super friendly and helpful. My favorite part of our stay was those sweet dogs! So well behaved and gentle. If I need to stay in Rexburg again with just me or plus one, I would definitely come back. Thanks for having everything so clean and comfortable!"

Stayed a few nights","I stayed here with my girlfriend. Our hosts were amazing, we felt so welcomed and it just felt like we are home.
We really enjoyed Carolyn's and Cody's presence and willingness to help. They had insightful recommendations about what to visit.
The house is located up the hill in a clean and quiet neighborhood where there are lots of green spaces thus the air being super fresh.
We had everything that we needed, the room and bathroom were very clean.
We had a great time, plus their cute dogs made our stay sweeter. 💓
I would highly recommend this hidden gem If you visit Rexburg.
Looking forward to visit again sometime in the future! :)
Cheers,
Andrei & Andreea"

Would absolutely stay here again. Within walking distance (street adjacent) to the Rexburg LDS temple and a reasonable walk to BYU-Idaho campus if that is important to you.
There was a friendly large dog when I was there if that is an issue for you. It wasn't for me, just FYI."

The best part about staying at Carolyn's home was her family. They were so kind and accommodating, it felt like we were staying with our own family. It never felt uncomfortable or awkward to come and go as we pleased. They treated us like family and still respected our space when we were tired from all our activities and just wanted to retreat to our comfy bed. My wife and I stayed in 6 different hotels/Airbnbs throughout our road trip and Carolyn's home was by far our favorite!"

Group trip","This is a really nice apartment. We loved it. Very nice furniture and so many things for your convenience. For example my wife and I each had our own small table with a lamp at each side of our bed. The lamp had plug ins for a 110 volt and a USB phone charger. In addition, the table itself had additional plug ins built into the table! We both were able to plug in our laptop AND phone; and still had extra plug ins. So convenient and handy. The WiFi was nice too. They didn't skimp on the bed either. It was a great mattress with good pillows and I slept like a log. I liked the shower. It had the upgraded double shower head. One showerhead was detachable and handheld. Good water pressure. Nice towels and plenty of them. We didn't do any cooking but the kitchen looked pretty nice. We were there with another couple and they said their bed was good too. I'm looking forward to staying here in the future."

While there is an A/C unit, it is in the playroom only and doesn’t cool the entire house. When we arrived the temp in the house was 80 degrees with no way to cool it. There are fans in the house and Rexburg cools off nicely in the evenings so we were able to get the temp down to 72 overnight, luckily. There is plenty of room in this house for a large group- more so than I expected from the photos."

Stayed with kids","Totally amazing stay! I don’t even know where to start! It is the most picturesque Airbnb we’ve stayed at so far. Just gorgeous! First thing my kids did was jump out to visit the horses. Then to the swings surrounding the fire. The owner lives next door and was extremely accommodating. He treated us like family, it was so cool! The lock was easy to use, and taking shoes off wasn’t a big deal since everything was easily accessible once you entered the house. Plenty of beds for the whole family. And they were so comfy! The downstairs family room and upstairs family/Rec room were all perfect size for our family reunion get togethers. It almost felt like the owners decorated and set up this house just for us! It felt like home! Piano, rocking chair, a place for everyone to spend time with who they wanted to. Just enough TVs. The kitchen was a little small for all of us, but we took it outside and that was so perfect sitting under the stars with twinkle lights above and fire in the middle as we swayed on the swings. I loved that the kids could play games upstairs and the adults could play games downstairs. So yeah, I hope we get to come again!"

Group trip","Sam's home was exactly what our family needed. plenty of space for a huge family, all the indoor amenities of a modern house, great water pressure, reclining sofas and every bed was comfortable! Although the location is a couple miles into the country it's also only a couple miles from the north end of town, Wal-Mart, the Teton River, Henry's Fork River, and not far from the Salmon River! It's also conveniently located from restaurants, fast food and BYU-I.
The Rexburg Temple is an easy 20 min drive, which was good for our wedding group. It eased some of the stress I had about getting everyone to my daughter's wedding.
Sam's house is clean and he doesn't ask tenants to do much cleanup beyond sheets, towels, kitchen messes and any blood on the walls after a fierce ping pong tournament!!! (Just teasing, my adult brothers behaved at ping pong while their kids tried to catch chickens!)
The kitchen has plenty of space for prep, cooking and eating and has the cooking equipment we needed for cooking breakfast for 30 and other smaller meals.
We're glad that we found Sam's listing, but my 4 sisters got upset that we 6 brothers were discussing a return trip to fish the local waters! So, the next trip to Sam's may be a family reunion when the weather is warm and we can enjoy the excellent grill patio and amazing firepit!
Thank you, Sam! We hope to see you again.
To all y'all looking, I highly recommend it!"

The owner is also very patriotic and has inspirational sayings all over the house. We loved it! The fire pit was the bomb with the hammocks and swings. We had the best flame broiled hamburgers! Suggestion: bring your own wood, or an axe to chop some huge logs they already have there, so they will burn. Also bring a grate with legs if you want to BBQ over the fire. The house is great for kids with a ping pong table and basketball game and 2 tv’s! Also there is lots of lawn to run around on, enough to play soccer on if you have enough players. There are 2 big very friendly dogs who bark at anything passing by, giving plenty of protection, so nothing will bother you at night. Definitely recommend!"

Everything was beautiful and peaceful and the weather worked out, and the house was a great gathering place for our family to come. The fire pit area we enjoyed the last night is just such a great place to be & hang out together. The upstairs game room is also a great gathering place, and we enjoyed playing games there together. Any question or concern was quickly answered, and Sam bent over backwards to make our stay as comfortable as possible. I can do nothing but recommend this place highly."

Not sure if our host upstairs was away for the time we were there or if they were quiet as ninjas, but we didn't hear a thing from the floor above us. Appreciated the affordability of our stay as well."

They kept the drive and stairs to the apartment cleared of snow. Beds were okay, mattresses and pillows aren't supportive. Kitchen is fairly well stocked; oil, herbs, pots, pans, etc. They need to add pepper to their seasonings. They have a coffee/tea/hot cocoa maker, too bad the hot cocoa only had 3 packets, so we were shy one and only had it for the first day, but it was a nice thought. Quality of dishes are mostly good. The first night was really quiet and it felt like we were alone even though the hosts live upstairs. The second evening, we could hear various noises upstairs; walking around, dropping things, and other sounds. Overall it was a good experience and we would stay here again."

Be aware that it is a basement dwelling, & it can get quiet noisy during the day due to all the upstairs commotion. If you have napping toddlers, it might not be the best fit for you. Everything quieted down every night at nine, but it was quiet noisy before that. We didn’t mind & realized that was probably why his place was such a steal! We’d definitely stay there, again!"

Stayed with kids","We enjoyed our stay! the home overall was clean and the neighborhood was conveniently located and quiet.
I would say, I think the people upstairs have little kiddos that run back and forth all day until around 8-830pm - which wasn't an issue for us as our 1 year old can sleep through literally anything and it stopped at a decent hour.
but if you have littles who have issues with taking naps or have an earlier bedtime and may have an issue with banging- be aware.
The array of k-cups and creamers was nice and so was having plates for kiddos !
One bed is basic and another is memory foam I believe. it's a very cute little duplex!
We would stay again!!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a very nice basement apartment in a house in a quiet neighborhood. We loved the layout and the amenities. The appliances seemed very new and everything was very clean and comfortable. I thought the beds were very comfortable. We could occasionally hear footsteps upstairs but it didn’t bother us. Each bedroom has its own temperature controller and also a separate one near the dining table, so it was nice to be able to set the temperature the way you like it. The fan for the heater in the bedroom with the bathroom was a little bit loud but not too bad—definitely better than the ones that are usually in hotel rooms. The laundry room is also set up like a second bathroom with a toilet, sink and vanity. We really enjoyed each having our own bathroom during our stay. The shower has really good water pressure and a nice shower head but it doesn’t have a way to adjust the volume of water. It’s either on or off and you turn the handle from cold to hot. There were 2 of us and I showered second every morning and ran out of hot water at the very end of my shower (but I like long showers). Just plan accordingly if staying with a bigger group. Overall it is a great place and I would like to stay there again!"

The drive to Yellowstone was not bad for us. The neighborhood is very safe and comfortable. This is a great deal and we will certainly stay again if in the area."

We got in earlier than we originally planned and Sean was able to have the place ready for us in time. Then an emergency came up and we cut our stay short and he was very understanding and accommodating for that as well! I very much recommend staying here and will again if I’m ever in the area again!

Jenna contacted us immediately to make sure we were okay. (Luckily it came on within the hour.)

This may be your option to put away the devices and just spend time with family and friends. If you need a snack and have no desire to leave, there is an in-house vending machine to fill the need of those hungry teens. This place should definitely be on the top of your list of places to stay, the themed rooms are an additional reason to make this your next resting place for a night or a week it is a great option, bring the kids and have a great time like we did. Thanks Jenna!"

The movie room was fantastic, comfortable, and the use of the equipment with easy to follow instructions. The pop corn popper was an extra plus. The neighborhood was quiet with low traffic volume and easy to access roads to down town. With so many rooms and sleeping options we had something for every one of our visiting family members. The price was a great value for so many options for indoor activities, and relaxing. Having 3 bathrooms for a larger group was definately a plus. The Kitchen was spacious and had everything we needed to prepare and serve meals. Our host was also helpful and responsive to questions, or needs. This home will be our first choice, should we need a place to stay for our family in this area again."

Instructions are clear - everything was clean, organized and more than perfect. They have ton of additional stuff that I can’t even remember - towels, blankets, pillows, beds and bath amenities etc.
Jenna was very responsive and friendly. Our stay was fantastic and if you are a family or group of friends looking for a stay while visiting GTNP or YNP, this is it. Comfortable driving distance. Thanks Jenna!"

The beds were comfortable. The rooms were warm in cold weather. It was great to be able to use the garage, it was near the temple and BYUI. It was quiet at night. The kids were ecstatic about the decorations and the vending machine. We will stay there again!"

The home, including kitchen was well equipped with the normal things that you would need. The home was very clean without making you feel as though you couldn’t touch anything. A truly “at home” feeling!
As an up and coming vacation home reviewer we give this a total of 4 1/2 stars.
Thanks Jenna’s house for a fantastic New Years vacation!"

The comfortable furnishings and charming decor created a warm and welcoming atmosphere that made us feel right at home. Situated in a convenient location, close to shopping and our daughter's school.
Joshua's level of accommodation and helpfulness was customer focused. From the moment we booked, he was responsive and went out of his way to ensure our stay was great. His hospitality truly set the tone for a great weekend.
We appreciate the snacks provided. It was a wonderful personal touch that made us feel welcome.

Stayed a few nights","Joshua was a great host and his property was super quaint and sweet. Super clean/spacious for what we expected, well stocked kitchen that included: spices, coffee, hot cocoa, mixing bowls, griddle, skillet, etc.. Laundry room was stocked with detergent & dryer sheets. Showers stocked with nice shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. Everything about the house was pleasant. ONLY complaints were that we were unaware the house was a duplex. Apparently the basement is an apartment unit. Nobody was there when we stayed but we would have liked to know that prior to booking. Especially considering the door to the basement unit apartment was in the primary bedroom and locked from the basement side—not ours, which left us feeling a bit uneasy just because it’s after-all a stranger’s home and we are in an unfamiliar area. Didn’t love that. Also, the area is pretty boring itself. And if you want to get to parks, the driving back and forth gets old and tiring—especially after long days at them."

Stayed a few nights","This home was fantastic. We were visiting three of our children at BYUI, and it was spacious enough that they could come over and play games with us and visit. The host was receptive and flexible. We even contacted him to stay another day! Beautiful home. Easy to get to restaurants and the school if wanting to see the campus. We were even able to drive to Jackson Hole for the day! There is a deck on the back of the house, but it was too cold to enjoy. We would absolutely stay here again."

And we appreciated the foldout foam beds for our daughters to sleep on. The extra little touches from extra pillows and blankets, to the hot chocolate bar and showering essentials with fluffy towels were just the best. We will always book this home whenever we come to Rexburg."

My husband and I and our youngest son came to town with our oldest daughter and her husband to help them find an apartment to live in here while attending school! From the moment we walked in we wished this spot could be the home they could stay in for the years they will live in Rexburg! We did find them a great apartment to call home, but this airbnb was a highlight of our trip! We hoped to rent it again in two weeks when we are back to moved them into their new place but of course others have found how amazing this airbnb is so sadly it is already booked! But we will definitely be staying here again! Better than the pictures! Every detail was perfect in this home!"

Stayed a few nights","Joshua‘s place was a little slice of paradise! He was one of the best and most communicative hosts I’ve ever stayed with. We had a lot of drama on arrival in town because we had booked an Airbnb elsewhere but that host never sent us the check-in information, so it took several hours of work with Airbnb support to get refunded and re-booked in a new place. By the time we booked Joshua‘s place it was quite late in the evening, but he was wonderful about helping get us in as soon as possible. His rental is by far the nicest we’ve ever stayed in, with beautiful renovations, very nice beds, and lots of fun details like a hot chocolate bar which we really enjoyed. It was also conveniently located extremely close to campus and downtown which made it easy to coordinate with the family members we came to see. Highly recommended!"

The open concept in the kitchen/living/dining room area made it feel really homey, as a great space to hang out and catch up on the day.
Everything was extremely tidy, with lots of thoughtful touches. The home came with a fun little coffee area (with hot chocolate to boot!), a little welcome gift with snacks (that we nearly annihilated!), and well stocked bathrooms.

The fully-stocked kitchen (except food) was great for cooking our meals, the Hot Chocolate Bar was awesome for the cooler weather we experienced, a small snack package was on the island when we arrived, board games for the family, shampoo/conditioner/body wash/hair dryer included, and a washer and dryer are available. And if you do need something, Walgreens and a local grocery store are not far (1-2 blocks). Only an hour and a half from the West Yellowstone entrance and two hours and 15 minutes from Grand Teton, which we planned to visit during our trip. This is only a few blocks away from BYU-Idaho as well, which was great because we toured campus on a rainy day. Overall, this was an awesome find and would be wonderful for anyone staying short or long term. A very family friendly neighborhood! The only con: we could not get the fireplace on the back deck to work, which was not a deal breaker for us. We grabbed blankets from the living room and hot cocoa ☺️"

Group trip","We just stayed here last week. It was very easy to find, and super clean. Easy walk to BYU-I for my husband's graduation. The host was very responsive in answering questions , usually responding in less than an hour. There are a few things to note that might be a drawback to staying here. First, the master bedroom is on the side of the building next to a busy street. It was loud and made it hard for my husband to fall asleep. Second, the beds in the 2nd and 3rd bedrooms are not comfortable. The mattresses are not soft. Third, there is only one nightstand in the master bedroom, with a chair on the other side of the bed. The nightstand has no outlet close, and there really should be some sort of bedside lamp so that if you get up in the middle of the night you don't have to turn on the bedroom light. I would still give this at least 4 stars because the host was so responsive, it was extremely clean, check-in/check-out was super easy, and it was an easy walk to the BYU-I campus."

The bathrooms are all in the same hallway with shared sinks. It seemed to be poorly insulated as I could hear the upstairs neighbors day and all night. They were noisy, though I don’t think they were doing anything other than moving around their apartment. The hot water went out for about 24 hrs. The hosts were responsive and working to get a plumber in but I was leaving so I asked them to wait until I checked out. By the morning I left the hot water was working again."

Stayed a few nights",Nice apartment. It had everything from shampoo and body wash to laundry detergent and dishwasher pods. Heads up on the twin sized beds they were very very firm. Hard as a rock. It took me a few nights to get used to it. There was no night stand next to the bed but I moved the little desk from the foot of the bed in between the 2 twin beds so I could have a place for my bottle of water in my ipad during the night. Also be aware that there doesn't seem to be any sound proofing so you can hear your neighbors walking in and out which is not a super big deal but if you are used to a quiet house with no neighbors it may bother you. With that being said if I were ever in the area again I would book it again.

There was no soap in the kitchen and very limited kitchen/cooking supplies. Overall it was a 4/5. Beds were comfortable and we all slept well but probably would stay somewhere else next time that was a bit less $$."

Stayed with kids","Had a good stay. Quiet neighborhood. Comfortable beds. Lots of light during the day. The kitchen had good utensils provided - but if you plan to cook, only a small salt & pepper shaker and a can of oil spray was provided. There's a Walmart about 2 miles away though, for cooking needs.
At check-in, we found that the parking permit was missing in the unit, but a quick message to the host took care of it fairly quickly."

Stayed with kids","We had a great time staying here. They left us more than enough parking passes, made sure to get us a pack & play, and overall host a great place for the family to stay. The only thing I will mention for improvement is the cleanliness of the bath towels; each one was stained with some sort of brown (looked like self tanner maybe?) and although we were positive they were clean, the stains threw us off a bit. Overall, an absolutely wonderful stay in a comfortable place with great amenities!!"

Group trip","We really appreciated the top floor unit, with a beautiful view of the temple from the balcony. The room with the King mattress was comfortable, but just a heads up, that the twin mattresses are dorm type mattresses that are basically a thick pad on a metal frame, so it’s like sleeping on the ground. Plenty of drawers and closet space in each room.
The unit is open and feels spacious, with a large kitchen. It was very nice to have 2 private shower/toilet rooms!
We would for sure stay here again!"

It's close to everything you need for your stay and seems like a quiet and safe family neighborhood."

very clean and modern. well maintained and beautifully decorated. The bedrooms were large and the beds were very comfy.
The bathroom area is quite large too and it was nice to have 2 showers and a separate sink/vanity area.
I highly recommend Angel Host and Brighams Mill for your next stay in Rexburg!! You will not be disappointed!!
The hosts are super fast to respond and very kind."

Stayed over a week","Upon arrival, we were given the wrong unit. We booked a unit with two king beds and this one only had one. Angel corrected and had us moved to a different unit.
Angel was very helpful throughout our stay. It did stink that she’d have to get in contact with other people for solutions, answers, and needs. Eventually, after a few days, she did provide us contact numbers for people who were local and they were great and very responsive.
One of the nights, a rain storm hit and the fire alarm started dripping water. We did have to put a bowl and some towels underneath. When we notified them, they immediately came to check it out and took care of the situation.
The unit we had was spacious! We loved that it had two toilets, two showers, three sinks, three bedrooms, a kitchen, and a living room. It was very clean too. We were missing an ironing board and pans, but I know if we asked, they would have found a solution for us!
Overall, great extended stay. Thank you Angel and team!"

Repeat: don't stay here!
It's a beautiful condo unit in a big complex, BUT it's very noisy because construction workers, college students, travelers are coming/going at all hours. Outside corridors and very disruptive - partying next to us until 2am! Kids jumping up/down above us. Traffic late at night and early in morning. It was like renting a room in a cheap motel ... for Holiday Inn prices! I asked for a 2 night out of 7 refund, but no joy! The site also listed complimentary coffee daily but the host didn't know about that!
NOT A GOOD DEAL or RESPONSIVE HOST."

Stayed over a week","These are great apartments located right off a main street in Rexburg, close the park, BYU, and the downtown strip. There is a gym on site, which was a big plus for me. There is high turn over here and the only downside is that you may have a noisy upstairs neighbors, but everyone generally turns down around 10 PM. By noisy, I mean people running around above you. Otherwise, the trade off for a little intermittent noise is totally tolerable, because these apartments are stocked with great appliances, utensils, good internet, and furniture. For travelling families, it is good to note that these apartments have large bathrooms, main bedroom, and two bedrooms each with two twin beds, plenty of utensils, large spacious common areas."

However, we were pleased that there was a convenient elevator next to our unit, so there were no problems.
The unit itself was spacious and pleasant. A large kitchen area, a relaxing living area, three bedrooms and a large bathroom area with two separate, private showers and toilets.
It was also convenient to most local restaurants and eating places.
We will definitely book here again when we need a place in the Rexburg area."

Be aware that this is a unit in a college town, and these condos are BYUI approved housing. That means sometimes it feels a little like living in a dorm because of the way the space is laid out (open closets, for example), but this wasn't a problem for our family."

Our particular until was located right next to the stairwell and twobof the bedrooms back up to the stairwell which is steel and you can unfortunately hear people going up and down the stairs in the early morning and late at night. Only one of the bedrooms has a bed that couples can sleep on together although all three rooms are big enough for a queen. The small twin beds in each of the other two rooms are sufficient for rest and sleep but not ideal if you are tall, or married and want to sleep next to your significant other. Overall it's a great place and convenient location to stay and the accomodations are very clean and nice. I would definitely use them again in the future if I had to."

Stayed with kids","We had a good time at this place, specially being so close to all the outdoor activities and things we had planned. The kitchen and bathroom was well stocked with what we needed. The place was generally clean so that was nice. Note that the host only provides what is on the property, anything extra you should bring, even trash bags. I loved how responsive the host was and all the detailed information they gave us."

Stayed with kids","Great place. Clean & comfy beds. If you have a big group or heavy footed family, this might not be for you… there are several signs around the home reminding you to not jump, stomp or horseplay. We didn’t have a problem since we only had a few of our teenage kids with us. I was constantly paranoid & kept telling my kids to talk quietly & not be loud or take showers after quiet hours. Also, we were going to have our adult married kids come over for a dinner but decided it might be too loud for downstairs renters. Other than that… great property!!! Highly recommend!!!"

My only recommendation is if you have children with you, because there is a basement unit , you need to make sure the kids don’t stomp or rough house. A bit of a challenge for my grandsons. Maybe ask for the basement unit if you have kids.
Otherwise it was the perfect location. Our family really enjoyed it."

Do be mindful of the quiet hours from 8pm-8am - we have young kids so tried our best to be respectful of those hours, but definitely a bit tricky at times.

Stayed a few nights","This is a beautiful home in the heart of Rexburg, Idaho. Sean was a great host. He communicated very well through Airbnb messaging and text messaging. He was pretty quick to respond and very professional. The check-in and check-out instructions were very clear and to the point. A home manual is provided in the home with instructions on how to operate certain items within the home. There is only one small AC unit in the living room and not throughout the entire house. My family and I had to be mindful of the 8pm-8am quiet time rule because there were also guests who stayed right below us in the home. They are completely separated from where we stayed and we rarely saw the other guests so no issues there. Local grocery stores, fast food restaurants, and gas stations are minutes away which is nice. Overall, my family and I enjoyed our stay here."

We LOVED that there was a fan in each room, kept things cool and blocked out any extra noise. Getting in every time was a breeze because the front door and the garage were the last 4 digits of our phone number-couldn't have been simpler! A/C worked great, charging ports of all different kinds were so convenient and we found them in the living room and the bedrooms. This place was so close to everything we needed and it had a great garage for parking and unloading. Couldn't have asked for a better place!!!"

Stayed with kids","Pros: Very clean and comfortable place for our family of 5. We enjoyed having a garage we could park in with the snow. We also appreciated the spices and oils in the kitchen as we cooked a lot. Night lights throughout the house were awesome as was the phone charging lamps by the bed. Lots of little touches throughout the place. Comfortable couches and beds.
Cons: Could use some upgrades on some kitchen utensils - and again, we cooked a lot so this was a bigger deal to me. Easy fixes though- like the can opener hardly worked at all, some better knifes, a decent cheese grater & a bottle opener. Also, no garage disposal so we had to dig out the food scraps when washing the pans.
The dryer didn’t work well so we had to dry our loads 2-3 times.
It’s bright in the bedrooms in the morning with the sheer curtains, but I just used a sleeping mask and that was fine. There was a noisy neighborhood dog a couple mornings, but what can you do about that? Overall our stay was positive!"

Stayed a few nights","This house is in a great location if you are visiting a college student- 5 min from the college, 5 min from eating places and a grocery store in Rexburg. It is in a quiet neighborhood as well.
The house is old but renovated and very clean and comfortable. The sheets on the beds were great - something I don’t usually say about hotel rooms/places we pay to stay. The space is smallish if you plan to have lots of people over, but we did have enough room for our sons and their friends. There is a “quiet time” between 8 pm and 8 am, and if this is difficult because of noisy children, this may not be the best option. There is a downstairs apartment we had to be aware of (take shoes off, no stomping). The kitchen isn’t as fully appointed as some places we’ve stayed, but we still were able to prepare food there without difficulty. All that being said, we did like this house very much."

Quiet time was from 8pm to 8am, and I think quiet time should probably start more around 9pm or so.
We did have to buy more toilet paper as there was only 1 additional roll provided and for a family of 6, we needed more.
I loved that they provided shampoo and conditioner in each bathroom.
This home fit all 6 of us well."

The house was perfectly clean, the kitchen had good amenities for cooking, and there was plenty of space for our family (5 adults). The mattresses on the bunk beds and in the master bedroom were very firm, and the queen bed in the third room was softer. Depending on your preference, some of the beds might be difficult to sleep on. Other than that, everything was great. Heating the house was easy, and there were lots of extra blankets. Having use of the garage was great, especially in winter. We would stay here again."

Group trip","This place is very clean, well-kept, and convenient. The bedrooms are well-sized and clean. The best thing about this beautiful home was the large amount of common area space, where we could gather & relax. Many Airbnbs in Rexburg have limited parking, but this place has plenty. That was a huge plus for us, because we have multiple children living in the area, and they sometimes braught their friends.
Sean was friendly, polite, and extremely responsive. For example, we asked for extra hangers, and he delivered them to the front door within minutes.
I've stayed in Rexburg several times, and this is easily the best place we've stayed at. If the stars align for my next stay and this home is available, I will definitely book it."

Stayed about a week","This place was perfect for my visit to rexburg. Enough space for my daughter to come stay with me. The place is actually decent size as well. The bathroom is no frills but works fine. As previous reviews stated the walls and ceiling are paper thin…like don’t have a private conversation. We were able to hear everything going on upstairs…conversations, the blender, vacuum,etc, but the hours were never extreme and it did not affect our stay at all. It is cozy and warm and had fans to keep the warm air moving. It was also nice to have laundry in the unit. Parking is right at the top of the exterior stairs. Would definitely stay again!"

Stayed over a week","Nice place to stay for a couple days, especially if you are visiting BYUI. The accommodations are very basic, but comfortable enough for a short term stay. The apartment is conveniently located; within close walking distance to campus. You can definitely hear the upstairs occupants at all times of the day, as this is a modified basement and not a true apartment (lacks a kitchen), but it’s not a deal breaker and the place is fairly comfortable. As mentioned in other reviews, the shower stall is very small and dark. The saving grace is that water gets warm quickly, stays warm, and has adequate pressure-good enough to get the job done. It is worth noting, however, that the bathroom area has no electrical outlets which makes using a blow dryer or curling iron by the mirror very difficult. If those are items you regularly use, prepare to get creative and fly blind, or simply bring an extension cord. All in all, this is a great, no-frills place to stay that includes an off-street parking spot, which is appreciated, especially during the winter months when there is snow on the ground. Communication with the host is easy, as he is prompt, clear, and polite. A reachable and attentive host is a nice bonus, which you will find here."

There were a few things I didn't expect that we ran into: Although I knew it was a basement apartment, I had not prepared for a fairly steep set of stairs (especially for my elderly mother). Also, being from the south, I expected there to be air conditioning. If it was there, I didn't see a way to control it. But, these things were manageable - and should not have thrown me for a loop at all. Bryce does provide large box fans which kept the air moving, and the stairs are well lit. Little things made it nice, including larger size, plush towels. All in all, nothing fancy, but something just right. Thank you Bryce!"

The parking spot is easily accessible, and the entry to the basement is convenient since it doesn't go through the rest of the building. Everything was clean and in good condition. The shower was fine but the showerhead is very low, making it somewhat difficult to use if you're tall. The light switch in the bathroom is in a confusing location. I don't remember if there was A/C, but the temperature was comfortable. The two beds are separated by a door, which is helpful when traveling with someone who snores."

Stayed a few nights",Stayed to be near Grand Teton and Yellowstone without the outrageous rates of actually staying at the park. Great value for location to the parks. Washer / dryer machine was a plus. Could be a bit noisy since In basement with a family upstairs. Other than that I would definitely recommend for a place to lay your head after a full day of adventuring.

Stayed a few nights",First off Bryce was amazing and so accommodating! The place is conveniently located an hour and a half from YellowstoneNP.The pictures are accurate.The place doesn’t have AC but they provided a fan when I needed! My only issue was the shower was tiny and kind of gross looking. But small price to pay for the location and price.

We especially liked the fact that it included a washer and dryer. The heating system took some getting used to but that is not a problem with the listing. Bryce went out of his way to make our stay great."

Stayed a few nights","This is a nice little place. This was our second time staying here. Last time was for a weekend, this time was for 5 days. We really like that it is our own private living space. It is in a basement but there is a separate entry from outside and you are provided your own parking space right at the top of the stairs.
Because this stay was longer we really appreciated having the mini fridge and microwave for meals and the washer and dryer was very convenient. Also, the WiFi is great. My husband worked online during the days with no problem. The shower is a little small, but works fine and has good water pressure. We would definitely stay here again in the future."
