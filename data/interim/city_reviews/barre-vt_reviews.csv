Stayed with a pet","Karen’s place is a gem! Her home is pristine. It was squeaky clean throughout.
Karen was easy to reach during our stay to answer any questions we had. She always promptly responded.
Her organization made our stay stress free! She provided written instructions as to what her expectations were for us, where to find things, appliance and device manuals. Everything was tastefully and clearly labeled. Wi-Fi was excellent.
Karen generously provided snacks and use of food staples.
The view from the deck is beautiful, peaceful, a lovely space to relax.
Our only suggestion is to have a hand rail by the concrete steps at the side entrance.
We highly recommend Karen’s place to all. We would definitely enjoy staying there again!"

Group trip","Our recent visit was nothing less than wonderful. This beautiful home was pristine, organized, beautifully decorated and fully stocked with anything/everything we might have needed for the perfect stay. Truly, nothing was out of place nor missing. The instructions re: heating, tv, appliances were spot-on. The history of the home and surrounding town/area were wonderful. I am a particularly picky person and a bit of a germ-a-phobe and I have nothing but glowing feedback to offer up. What a gem in the beautiful Vermont hills. 10++++"

Stayed with a pet","Karen & John have really gone above and beyond to make their home accommodating for their guests. We rented their home for a long weekend winter stay with our children and dogs. There was plenty of room for everyone, they provided all the necessities and comforts and clear instructions for the house. They were very easy to communicate with and it was an easy check in process. It was clean and had 5 star quality beds and bathrooms. We were able to drive to local VT towns such as Stowe and Montpelier and the kids enjoyed playing and sledding in the spacious backyard. We would definitely return! Thank you for a wonderful stay!"

Beautiful grounds woke up our first morning to 2 deer under the apple tree. just far enough from downtown Barre but still close enough for anything you need.

The home itself has everything you could ever possibly think of or need on a vacation. Everything is spotless. I’ve been in at least 6 other AirBnBs, and this was by far the best. Tons of room, tons of amenities, and an amazing host. We will definitely be back again!
Thank you Karen!
Ps. The pool is excellent and has a gorgeous view of the mountains."

We travel all over the US for work (polishing concrete) & stay at a lot of Airbnb’s due to the length of time we are usually in town. I tell you NOTHING can compare to the cleanliness, the amenities, the “snack draw” or the views at Karen’s. This place is perfect for large families & 20 mins from Montpelier, VT. We’ll definitely be booking again if available when we have to come back to VT."

Stayed with a pet","This was the perfect house for our family weekend! The set-up of the house was just right, with the playspace (and toys!) downstairs and a vast outdoor area, which was a perfect place to let the kids run, even on rainy days (great washer-dryer ...). Having a pantry well-stocked with essentials, as well as two complete kitchens filled with small appliances, dinnerware and utensils, made managing meals for our crowd so much easier than we have experienced at other short-term rentals. These hosts really anticipated every possible need, and provided extras of EVERYTHING, as well as great recommendations for activities and restaurants in the area. The location is so private (we had deer visit on several mornings!), yet five minutes away from a supermarket, a playground, drugstore and great coffee options! We were thrilled that we could bring our dog as well. An overall excellent experience that we would highly recommend to any group, especially families with young children. Thanks!"

The space was clean and quite new looking, and despite being small everything needful was accounted for. We did not realize that the fireplace was not functional and that the water for the tubs would be shut off due to the temperatures already being below freezing. It was a bit disappointing as these are two features that caught our eye in the listing. Nevertheless we had a wonderful and very comfortable stay."

Would like to come again the next foliage season!
The hosts are very friendly and always ready to help (everything went very smoothly so actually we don't need to contact them). Winnie is adorable and we'll definitely miss her!

Of course you can’t beat that view! My partner and I used this space to introduce him to my family in VT and it was the perfect atmosphere for the moment.

Stayed a few nights","Super cozy cabin - looks exactly like the photos. The kitchen is well stocked with utensils, coffee and tea pods. We saw stars and the meteor shower was beautiful, so peaceful with cows grazing across the street. Their dog Winnie is adorable and Travis is a great host - he was there if needed, friendly but didn't intrude. He welcomed us to use the outdoor fire pit and there is an outdoor shower and tubs! We really enjoyed some serious down time in a peaceful, bucolic, rural setting. Great place if you like to kick back or paint landscape or other creative pursuits. Dining at Positive Pie in town is awesome as is the Plainfield Food Coop for food. It's near Barre and Montpelier, which is slowly digging out - Sarduccis, Skinny Pancake and a coffee shop are open now."

Stayed with a pet","My wife and I together with our dog had an incredible stay in the hills of Central Vermont at Travis’ beautiful cabin.
The property was quiet, serene, and had an incredible view overlooking the surrounding green hills & mountains.
The porch/deck was spotless and had great seating for chilling with a glass of wine or beer in the evenings, and a cup of joe with a view in the mornings.
Our dog loved the property, and it gave him space to stretch his legs through the manicured lawn and apple trees.
The cabin itself was perfect for a cozy stay for two. It had everything we needed and was smartly decorated, along with a very comfortable bed.
Travis was very helpful with some great local recommendations, including food (Positive Pie down the hill in Plainfield had fantastic take out, try the fried brussel sprouts) and local hiking opportunities (Spruce Mountain).
We definitely hope to return to Travis’ cabin in the future. Thanks for the great hospitality and good times!"

Stayed a few nights","Considering we drove in the day of a terrible flood statewide in Vermont, we still made the best of our stay with lots of hiking and biking. Travis, his gf and their dog were very friendly. Travis was even nice enough to have us follow him into town where he told us about some local places we could try and get food and groceries (many places shut down due to flooding). The cabin was beautiful and the views were even better. The highlight of my trip was sitting in the tubs with my significant other taking in the sunset and just relaxing. With his house being close by, you wouldn’t even notice. We felt so at home & relaxed the entire time. Would 100% recommended and would definitely book again if traveling back to that area. Thanks Travis!"

Stayed a few nights","Travis was fantastic. The cabin was very comfortable and we really enjoyed the quiet get away from the hustles and bustle of city life. Travis was available when needed. I had two suggestions that would have improved my stay but we went out and bought a wine bottle opener and left it for the next company that is to come and stay here. Therefore only one other which is a hard one because of the limited space you have in the kitchen. But there is no microwave so don’t do like we did and bring food to reheat.
There is a bit of a incline to walk to and from the cabin and with a bad knee it was a little difficult but it was also my fault for not researching the accessibility before I booked. Great outdoor atmosphere with the camp fire and loved the tub at night to watch the sun set!"

Stayed with a pet","Travis' cabin is one of the most memorable Airbnbs we've stayed at. Their dog Winnie is so cute and friendly. We let our dog off leash for the first time here since Winnie was able to keep her in the area.
The views are fantastic, and Travis was kind enough to set us up with the amazing fire pit.
The wifi wasn't great, but that's not what you come here for. This is the perfect cabin to disconnect! Although we did cheat and brought our Nintendo switch!
highly recommend this place!"

Stayed with a pet","Could not be happier with our stay! Only downside was that our schedule did not allow us to stay more than a night. The cabin itself is very nicely updated and decorated and was a great spot for us visiting the area. It has a great outdoor space with the deck, soaker tubs (with unbelievable views of the mountains), and a nice fire pit area. Location was ideal providing a nice, private getaway but a quick drive to Montpelier (and easily could be a great jump off point for other spots to visit in VT). We grabbed dinner at the Plainfield location of Positive Pie, very tasty and only a 5-minute drive from the cabin. Overall, we would definitely recommend Travis' cabin for any stays in Central/Northern VT. We will be back!"

Stayed with a pet","Staying here was some of the best money I've ever spent.
Short story long, my boyfriend took me camping for the first time, and I decided it wasn't for me lol. I was going to book a random hotel room, but he found this place, and we were able to book about 9 hours before we showed up.
Travis was an excellent host. He let us know he was out of town, but his friend would turn over the cabin, and he hoped it was sufficient and to let him know if we needed anything.
Let me just say that the pictures of the view do not do it justice. Spectacular and breathtaking don't begin to cover it. We took advantage of the outdoor tubs as the sun was going down.. wow! I would've spent the money for that experience alone. It really was magical.
Inside the cabin was very clean and comfortable. Since I didn't get much sleep the night before, I was so thankful to have a clean, comfy bed to sleep in.
Overall, if I could give more stars, I would. I can't wait to plan another stay here soon!
Thank you Travis!"

Stayed one night","This faux hunter's cabin is sweet! It is tastefully appointed in line with its description. True to his profession as an owner of a commercial painting company, Travis has finished the place well. I can speak to this personally because I work in the trades in Maine. The bed is comfortable and the place is freshly appointed. I was delighted when, as I was using the common space fire pit, I was joined by Travis, his girlfriend, and their dog. We chatted as the dogs chased each other around the yard. I left to pick up food from Positive Pie, a top notch pizza place! Highly recommended! The coup de grass for me was the outdoor shower! Using it at 11 pm with the stars and planets above was an amazing experience! In closing, Travis has created an experience that is worth the money."

Beautiful wood finishes throughout, and equipped with a full sized refrigerator and stove as well as a stall shower, couch, drop-down table, lots of cabinet space, and two sleeping lofts. One loft accessed through a staircase built into the side of the trailer with a comfortable queen bed and curtained windows looking across to the mountains over the fields. We didn’t use the second loft area. Nice linens and pillows. Note it’s a loft, the ceiling is close (although arched). Not a problem for us.
Kitchen well stocked with Keurig, microwave, toaster, service for two, towels, drying rack, and cleaning supplies.
Cupboards stocked with games, a few books, additional storage.
Charming, eclectic and a real sense of being somewhere else!!"

Stayed one night","Had a great stay at Kristin’s. Got to explore Barre and its surrounding areas and wasn’t disappointed. Brought my big brother around for his first ever visit to VT and we had the best time! Very responsive, very kind, I’m absolutely going to book here again. Only downside were the neighbors in the building next to this one deciding to weed-whack at 8:30pm but it was nothing that the ac couldn’t cover up so we were good lol! Even post Flood, Vermont still holds up, and I know people talk big about it in the winter but the summer time is something else. And I’m a fella who lives on a mountain in Maine. Thanks again Kristin!!"

Parking was easy. Kristin was a great host ands proactive in sharing check-in information. Check-out was a breeze. The location was quiet and convenient without issue. The only negatives are: the trundle bed is not very comfortable, probably better for a child than a middle aged person. The location is near industrial sights. It served our needs well."

It was a a short drive to the center of Barre, and it was also easy to get to Montpelier in less than 20 minutes for more restaurants/activities. There was enough space for 4 adults and a baby. The bedrooms are separated by the living room/kitchen area so there was plenty of privacy. We would certainly recommend or stay at Beth’s spot again."

The space is brand new and beautifully renovated. Loved that the 2 rooms were on opposite sides of the living room so we had some privacy. Plenty of storage space for clothes. Having kids, I really appreciated that all electrical outlets were protected by safety plugs and she had kid cutlery and plates in kitchen. Great to have washer/dryer as well. Kitchen had everything we needed, including complimentary coffee and water bottles. Appreciated the recommendations for food shopping and dining out. Super comfy rocking chair (a big hit with my kids) and beds. Location was quiet neighborhood with playground 7min walk or 2min drive. Quick 5min drive to downtown Barre.

Stayed with kids","The apartment worked out perfectly for us. Very clean and nice inside. Relatively easy drive up to Stowe for skiing (~35 to 45 min) but also have local amenities such as a Hannaford grocery store about 5 minutes away and a large Walmart not too far either (15 mins).
Location:
The house is a multi-family with more than one apartment, and it's across the street from some industrial buildings, but it was quiet and worked out really well. Seems really well isolated. Plus, it was close to everything we needed in town.
Accommodations:
The apartment was clean and comfortable and looked to have been recently redone. Bedrooms were clean and worked out well. Washer and dryer were new and useful. There is only one bathroom on the main floor while all the bedrooms are on the top floor. Not a problem though.
Check-in and checkout:
Checked in via a code on the door. Worked well. Put in the same code to lock the door when you leave.
Overall, would be happy to stay there again."

Stayed a few nights","Very clean and well appointed unit! This unit is one of three in the building. It's conveniently located with easy access to restaurants and stores in Barre. The house was cleaned just before we arrived and the cleaner communicated to the host that the town water was dirty. We were informed and able to pick up some jugs of water for drinking & coffee before we arrived. The unit was very clean and had everything we needed for our three night stay. We enjoyed coffee and breakfast in the morning before heading out for the day. The house is located in a mixed use neighborhood. There are plenty of houses around but also some industrial-use sites as well. We felt comfortable and safe inside the unit, but the location is for convenience and not for enjoying the view. It met our needs as we were on the go most of each day. The value was great for us. We had much more space than a hotel room would provide. I would stay here again, or look for other listings from this host."

On hot days the window AC units cooled things down nicely, and the home had everything we needed including kitchen appliances, plenty of towels and extra blankets, and reliable wifi. Host was very responsive when we had questions.
One thing that we didn't notice from the pictures is that the 3 bedrooms are upstairs and the bathroom is downstairs, and the stairs are quite short and steep. Just something to note for someone who might have mobility issues. But for us it worked out great."

Stayed a few nights","Negative: The bathroom is downstairs and bedrooms upstairs. Very inconvenient for us as we get up during the night to use the bathroom. The stairs are rather steep. A little tough on my mom who has some mobility issues.
Positive: great price, cleanest AirBnb I have been in, parking is in lot near back door so didn’t have to park on the street. Well stocked with coffee pot and frother , k-cups, dishes, full kitchen, hairdryer, flat iron, steamer, iron, and very soft towels. She doesn’t stock toiletries so bring your own.
Very quiet and temperature controlled. Full size bed is a little on the firm side, my parents slept in the queen size and said it was perfect. We did not use the daybed.
Not many restaurants in Barre so I suggest eating in Montpelier. Hope Cemetery is just a few miles away. You HAVE to go there. Give yourself at least an hour there."

There is no kitchen but restaurants in Montpelier (less than 20 minutes away) are so fun and there are so many choices you wouldn't want to cook anyway. Having breakfast with Gail and her husband (we chose to visit with them as well as be served) was definitely one of the highlights of our trip. The bathroom is huge and the walk in shower luxurious for a rural setting. Lots of room in this spacious airbnb to spread out and relax and the setting in beautiful Plainfield with longrange views of the Green Mts is a delight. We loved every morning driving down the hill and seeing the views as we set out on our explorations. Highly recommend!

Stayed a few nights","Our 3 day stay in Vermont was made so much nicer by this wonderful accommodation. Set on the top of a hill in peaceful, rural Plainfield, we were able to see beautiful mountain peaks with stunning sunrises and sunsets. Our host, Gail, was ever so warm and welcoming while her husband, Strat, had an incredible wit and delightful sense of humor. We thoroughly enjoyed their company and interesting conversations each morning.
This home had all of the things that one would expect in an Airbnb plus some very thoughtful surprises. It was immaculately clean upon our arrival, had good WiFi and cell service, ample toiletries with Vermont made soaps, a comfortable bed, soft linens and towels. What we did not expect was the decadent towel warmer which was appreciated on chilly mornings, fresh cut flowers from the garden and a delicious breakfast every morning. We have stayed in dozens of Airbnb’s and have never been served a hot breakfast. Gail and Strat alternated the cooking duties using ingredients that were fresh from their own garden, a neighboring farm or the farmers market, a pure delight. Gail had messaged us earlier to identify any dietary restrictions and then went out of her way to provide us with non-dairy milk and cheese.
It is no surprise why they have hundreds of excellent reviews. Their Super host status is very well deserved and our stay with them exceeded our expectations. We will definitely plan to stay here again the next time we visit this area and needless to say have no hesitation recommending Gail & Strat’s lovely home."

The breakfasts by both her and her husband are delectable, and the guest space in her home is clean and welcoming; the yard and surrounding nature is absolutely gorgeous as well! Gail puts a lot of work into making her home a space that you can make feel like your home away from home, and it does not go unnoticed. Staying with Gail was my first ever solo Airbnb stay, and I am sure I will be hard-pressed to find as outstanding of a host as she is in future Airbnb stays elsewhere. Gail is truly a class act, and if you have the opportunity to stay with her, then don’t think twice about it; you will not be disappointed!"

We especially appreciated the accommodations our hosts provided, including the delightful breakfasts. Gail even hung up our laundry on the outdoor drying line for us one day while we were busy enjoying the sights in the Barre/Montpelier area. Both Gail and Strat were attentive each day and offered helpful suggestions - and Strat has the gift of humorous interaction with little kids!
If you're looking for a place which encapsulates what Vermont has to offer at its best - in both landscape and people - I highly recommend this AirBnB."

Quiet, cool even on hot days (for us), and located close to Plainfield with its wonderful food co-op and other resources. Gail made us delicious home-cooked breakfasts with ingredients from her garden and is knowledgeable about all things local. Her personal library (located in the guest quarters) was particularly enjoyable, covering everything from poetry and classic literature to late-60's civil rights. After a week, we felt steeped in the slow pace of Vermont's green hills, small towns and dirt roads. Don't miss the Creemies! We'll be back."

The setting is so pretty and tranquil you don't want to leave. The space is very comfortable and well taken care of. There are few nice antique pieces which gives the place unique character and makes it feel warm and cozy. The breakfast was delicious and nicely presented and Gail even asked us before arrival if we have any preferences and/or food restrictions. And we especially appreciate the fact that Gail and Strat allow guests to bring their dogs. It certainly means more work for them to keep the place sparkling clean, and they don't even charge extra for it like most other places. We hope to be back and we highly recommend this place to anyone traveling to Central Vermont."

Stayed a few nights","2174 Upper Rd, Plainfield is a great location. It is quiet, the view is beautiful and
Gail and Strat are extremely thoughtful and interesting hosts. We never had conversations like those we had there in any other BnB we’ve stayed at. And the breakfasts that we kibitzed over were darn good too. I have to mention that when Strat filled in for Gail, he did a most commendable job in this department, including making some delicious pancakes.
The bedroom and living room were spacious, comfortable and quite homey. There were a spate of interesting books on the shelves, including some really helpful guidebooks with a number of walks and hikes in Plainfield and the surrounding area.
This is a excellent part of Vermont if you like great walks, interesting towns and fun motoring (There’s not many places that I like to drive in, but this is one of the finest ones). Positive Pie just down the road in Plainfield has excellent pizza and salads. Nearby Cabot is a fine little town, but, alas, the Cabot Cheese factory was closed due to the Corona Virus. If you are lucky, it will reopen and you can stop to taste their cheeses.
Also, try and make it over to nearby Bragg Farm Sugar House on Rt. 14 for a super Maple Softee Ice Cream cone.
All-in-all, a fine place to have your quintessential Vermont vacation"

The next morning a copious breakfast awaited us at the exact time we had agreed upon. We even had a chance to taste the homemade apple butter Gail had prepared the night before!

Vermont is a special place and staying at Gail's home gives a wonderful VT feel. There are beautiful views, fields to walk in and no traffic. A great co-op just 2 miles away in the small town. This was a great place to unplug."

The atmosphere is family atmosphere, the place allows you to experience the best that Vermont has to offer (nature, green, the view), the house is warm with experience, the breakfast is delicious and comforting. In addition, the hosts are very educated and smart people with whom it is very pleasant to chat. And they love children, which allowed our 3-year-old to enjoy his stay too."

Strat is a man with a distinct creative flair when it comes to telling a story, preparing a meal, or speaking about the rich natural beauty unique to Vermont. That he shares the same birthday as Shakespeare is no coincidence. They are many wonderful Superhosts with Airbnb, but these two remain on the top of my list.
If you want to enjoy the true experience and wonder of Vermont, this is the place to stay!"

Stayed a few nights","Gail and her husband are very welcoming and prepare an absolutely delicious breakfast, which they share with guests in the main quarters to their home.
The guest suite is very well kept, clean and includes a full-sized bed, futon that pulls out into a bed, a baby crib, and a sitting table next to large windows overlooking picturesque views. There is no television, but very good wifi which worked perfectly as I caught part of a game on my tablet. The bathroom includes standard sink and toilet, and a very modern walk-in shower with choice of overhead or hand held spray.
The suite attaches to the main portion of the home through a double door, and even though it is in close proximity to their main living quarters, Gail and her husband maintain a perfect balance of friendliness and respect for their guests’ privacy.
The home is located a few minutes from the charming town of Plainfield, in a rural area high upon a hill with tremendous views. If possible it is best to arrive during sunlight so you can enjoy the beautiful scenery, but also for ease of navigation - you will be away from the brightness of city lights in this wonderful, natural setting!"

The location was great, the amenities were great, the accommodations were great...I have absolutely nothing negative to say. What a great first experience! Most importantly for me, they welcomed my big puppy Luna with open arms. She enjoyed her stay just as much as we did!

Gail and Strat are fantastic hosts. Strat makes best blueberries crepes topped with local organic maple syrup. I said to my mom through the breakfast that I feel like we're in a home.
Being from India and global citizen, I was impressed by their global knowledge and perspective as well as very respectful of other culture and nationals. If I'm back in Vermont, I'll be looking this site up to see if it is available. Highly recommended! I can't wait to come back.

House was clean and had all necessities, more than you can find in the hotels… you can tell that James thinks about his guests and wants them to be comfortable there. I loved vintage and eclectic interior, just perfect for winter stay in Vermont. We would definitely want to stay there again when back to the area."

Loved the Vermont eggs and butter left for us in the fridge and the plentiful coffee options. James was very accommodating for our bulldogs, but important to keep them on a leash in the back yard. Nice stay!"

The beds are so comfortable and the kitchen has a modern retro feel. The home is also pet friendly which was the biggest draw as we are traveling with our dogs. The dogs enjoyed the back yard and cozying up in the living room. We also appreciated being able to do our laundry and having clean clothes!

Stayed with a pet","When we arrived at the house the pictures were deceiving of the driveway etc. We spent the first two nights with a musty smell and my wife started to have some issues. We contacted the host about it and he said he would refund a night stay. We opened windows and went in the basement where there was water in the basement and smelt really musty. There was a dehumidifier in the basement that was full and the moisture in the air said 80%. we emptied the dehumidifier 3 times and lowered the humidity. I told the host this. The host then on a message to me and said there wasn't an issue with the house but with my ""WIFE"". The host also went on and said that he found that the water was from a leak from the TUB. Claimed that the house had no issues and said it was my wife. REALLY!!! However, there was a leak in the tub according to the HOST. If you stay here check it out and if any issues get him there to fix it ASAP. DO NOT take his word on anything."

James thought of many special touches like a pizza pan, an ice bucket already chilling in the freezer, and a grocery bag for use (VT stores require you to bring your own bags). There was a wonderful list of restaurants posted on the fridge.

Stayed a few nights","Our family was in town for a family reunion, and stayed at James's place. The house was exactly as described, and suited our needs perfectly. There was plenty of bedding and towels, and everything we used was functional (lights, oven/stove, toaster, keurig coffee maker, washer/drier, dishwasher, shower, TV, etc.). That is sometimes not the case in an airbnb, so it was much appreciated. The kitchen has all the cookware and utensils you could want, and all of it is in excellent condition. Very nice plates, bowls, mugs, glasses, flatware, and knives. The ""extras"" like measuring cups/spoons, vegetable peeler, bottle opener were also available. Plenty of space for 4 people, as well as a few dinner guests. Beds were super comfortable, as were the chairs and sofa in the living room.
This airbnb is not really in walking distance to any attractions or stores. But it's an easy drive almost anything you'd want to do in the Barre/Montpelier area--very close to I-89, a little over a mile to a good grocery store, about 3 miles from town and some good restaurants, and a couple miles to the granite quarries, Thunder Road race track, and the Millstone hiking/biking/x-country ski area.
James communicates very well, and check in/out was super easy. Highly recommend this house!"

We stayed in July while passing through to Maine and had a fantastic stay in the Green Mountain region. Staying here during ski season would be even better. Everything is even better than the listing. Highly recommend!"

The beds were comfortable, and the bedding was very nice. Outside temp was in the 80's and James had the house all cooled off with the portable AC units and fans for our arrival."

Stayed one night","We have been visiting Vermont for many years and typically stayed with friends in Barre. But, with growing children and aging adults, we decided it was time to find a place where we could stretch out more and have a little privacy. This was the perfect place. It was nice to be able to get up and make our own breakfast … with farm fresh eggs that James left in the fridge. This was the end of our vacation, so it was a bonus to be able to wash and dry our clothes too. The beds were super comfy and despite being near the main road, the place was very quiet. Lots of super cute decor draws you in to looking around the living room and family room. This is our second time renting from James, but a different place this stay. We chose this place because we were so impressed with him last time."

The electric fireplace is really nice for ambiance along with house plants and art work. Our one suggestion is to add a coffee maker vs. just a Keurig. Thanks for providing a nice place for family time together along with our dog. Location is very convenient, near highway. We would definitely stay again!"

Group trip","What a cool and cozy place. James’ place has a ton of personality. All decked out in 60’s decor, it’s a sight for your senses and makes you nostalgic for years ago. Although we didn’t get a chance to stay long, all 3 bedrooms are comfortable. Everything was clean. When we arrived…late, James had lights on, it was nice and warm. So quiet and we slept soundly. James is a host that replies quickly. Would absolutely stay again if in the area. Thank you James."

The house has so much beautiful space and was even more than we expected. The art work,decor care and upkeep of this 1960s home was very evident will all the love and care.
We felt energized and relaxed by it all and like we had our own space to feel at home.
My family and I had so much fun here during our stay.
The house is perfect for short term and long term stay and we will definitely be back."

Stayed one night","If you tend towards OCD, maybe this place is not for you. However, if you enjoy the eclectic, Jame’s place is a delight. It’s like eye candy for the soul. The bedrooms were great. I would call it 1 3/4 baths + 1 in the basement, but whose counting? It was plenty for good for our party (two couples).
James was a great host. One of our group want feeling well and we asked for a late checkout. James went out of his way to re-schedule a maintenance to accommodate us.
We stayed in 3 bnbs on our New England trips. This was my sister in laws favorite & my wife couldn’t stop marveling over the plants.
Oh, did I mention the location? Set us up 30 minutes from Stowe, closer to Mountpelier, all at a reasonable price for the area. We would definitely come back."

Stayed one night","We had never been to Vermont and weren't familiar with cities or neighborhoods but we were doing a short driving tour that included a tour of the Rock of Ages quarry in Barre. James's place was bigger than we needed but reasonably priced and the location made sense. It is, as seen in the pix, on a hill with a view and a deck and meadow. The exuberantly kitschy interior might be confusing for some but underneath the cheerful devil-may-care interior decor (vintage and otherwise) is a solid professional attention to creature comforts for guests. Barbecue implements are set outside with the grill for your use; the kitchen is stocked: coffee, a few eggs in the fridge (in case you've arrived late with no groceries in this rural-ish area that might be hard to explore in the dark), dishes, cookware and implements (in case you've come w/ groceries ready to hibernate); extra blankets, etc. The location is great for the fun, informative quarry tour and various shops and services aren't far."

I recommend visiting the Rock of Ages Granite Quarry, the East Barre Antique Mall and having a meal at The Firehouse Inn. Pearl Street Pizza is really good, too!

Stayed with kids","We were on the tail-end of a New England road trip, and James’ place gave us extra comforts that our other accommodations didn’t.
We were especially grateful for the a/c. Though northern VT is often known for its coolness, it was near 100 with very high humidity while we were there.
We also appreciated the living room space. When a place is advertised for 6 people, it’s nice when the living room provides enough comfortable seating for 6 people…which James’ house did.
Having extra pillows for each bedroom was also a plus. Pillows were sparse or non-existent in other rentals.
James definitely took care of us. He labeled things well and kept things clean. He was flexible and great at communication. The area is quiet, with a spacious yard and beautiful view."

It is a miracle that my 1 year old didn’t break anything and I am eternally grateful I noticed the lower windows were open before she busted out of a screen. Booking this trip without her future age in mind was a mistake on my part, but just a consideration for those who are traveling with a young toddler."

But it was homey and comfortable."

The views from the back window are breath-taking, and the proximity to downtown Barre is very convenient. The images posted on the Airbnb website need to be updated, as they do not reflect the current state of the home. We found there to be much more home decor, which to some may be interesting. We also came across some repairs that needed to be done-- some were taken care of upon arrival when we asked, others we didn't have information on."

Stayed a few nights","James really went above and beyond for myself and my sister. When we hit crisis mode with both the death of a family member and the confirmation that my father has dementia. My sister and I were looking for a place that offered solace and a place to come cry and decompress more after staying with the sadness.
The home itself is so fun and funky. Getting there I had to Video Chat close friends and family from home to show them how great this loving collection of cool funk was displayed. The combo of the collection of kitch to really beautiful period pieces - neat 60s furniture was great. Some I wish I had home they were so comfortable. The bedroom I stayed in had a HUGE closet and the bed was so comfortable I was asleep before you know it. The kitchen pictures do not show the absolute beautiful collection of colored glassware and all the amazing appliances. Check in / out was a dream. Our host James helped me by walking me through the internet process. I wasn't connecting correctly to the internet and he was available and responsive (almost immediately - even after normal hours - as I didn't get back until later) to help which was important since I had to get work done.
When we travel back to Vermont I would stay with James and his homes anytime. I really recommend.
And a special thank you again for our lovely host being super helpful. You made a really horrid time in our lives easier by opening your home for us to stay."

The apartment was spotlessly clean, well equipped and well laid out.
We loved the kitchen area, one could not have asked for more! 5-stars from my me :)
We had a tranquil scenic view right from our living room sipping cuppa coffee and watching the snowfall. Kid and I played in the snow minding the property restricted zone (as confirmed by James).
The check-in process was simple and secured to get into the property.
The stay was comfortable for my family and I would recommend the property to my friends too for a cozy getaway."

Our first morning there we found the internet upload speeds were a bit low for Zoom, but James generously offered to let my husband give a video presentation from another property of his that has Fios. During the remainder of our time at the house we found the internet was perfectly adequate for most uses - including a few video calls via Teams.

“City Heights” is a good location if you want to explore areas in northern Vermont. We visited places like Stowe and Glover and were back in plenty of time to enjoy the uniquely decorated surroundings of James’ 60s style home. And to add to the fun “Bernie“ (sitting quietly) awaits his guests in the basement. If really comfortable beds are a priority then you will find them here. In the morning when you open the fridge you find delicious farm fresh eggs awaiting you. Your host James is a great communicator and will bend over backwards to ensure all your needs are met. He is very kind, caring and thoughtful. It’s a pleasure to stay at his amazing “City Heights” home."

Thoughtful touches abounded--everything we needed was available and our family of 5 settled right in comfortably. The house is delightfully decorated. We had a great time looking around at the memorabilia and quirky art.
Communication was excellent. Response times were very short. Our only disappointment was discovering that it was not available for our next visit to VT....but we're hoping to stay again in the future."

Stayed a few nights","Kayla and Martin’s place was a great base camp for our ski weekend at Stowe! Stowe was an easy 45 minute drive. Their place is also easy walking distance to restaurants in downtown Barre. Highly recommend Ladder 1 Grille! The apartment is cozy and spotlessly clean, plenty of room for my husband, myself, our adult daughter and her friend. Kayla and Martin are extremely responsive and caring hosts! They answered all of my questions immediately and even provided a space heater when I thought one of the bedrooms might be a little chilly but it turns out the bedroom was perfectly comfortable and we didn’t even use the space heater. Kayla and Martin, thank you for a wonderful weekend! We would definitely book your place again for our next ski or summer vacation in Vermont!"

She gave us clear and easy instructions to follow for check-in and check out which felt seamless. She was very responsive to any questions we had.
The home was very clean and tidy with beautiful hardwood floors and comfy beds. The kitchen was equipped with everything we needed to cook our meals which saved us so much money since we didn’t have to order in.
My family particularly loved the backyard area with beautifully wooded surroundings which highlighted Vermont’s natural beauty.

There is good reason we came back. (We visit relatives in Barre and have stayed multiple places. This is the best place we stayed.) Clean, spacious, thoughtful touches beyond the usual drill of milk and eggs in the fridge: toothbrushes provided, shelves filled with board games and a mixture of good literature, washer and dryer available in the basement, etc. Also a nice yard in the back that we enjoyed last time but did not have time to enjoy as much this time. Though we did see a mama bear with cubs in the woods behind the yard! (Location is on a hill overlooking town, and a short trip to shops and restaurants, but still near the woods.) For folks not on the cutting edge: The ""smart"" a/c-heat is a challenge to control. Neither the unit itself nor the remote is intuitive. But overall a five-star stay and host."

Stayed a few nights","I was very disappointed with my stay, unfortunately. I’ve stayed at a number of Airbnb’s and have never had such a terrible experience. First, we arrived to a 47 degree house because the heat had not been turned on prior to our arrival. The front step was quite icy and there was no salt to put down to melt it. The host had said there was a delivery of salt coming and gave me permission to open the package. The two packages of salt were probably around 50 pounds each, which I had to drag into the house. We found ourselves boiling at night because the heat vents are located at the head of each bed, making it feel like a sauna even with the heat set down to 65. On the first morning, we discovered the coffee maker was dirty, with coffee grounds in the water well. Come to find out it was because the coffee maker doesn’t drip properly and made the water overflow at the filter. The entire trip was just one thing after another. I would not recommend to anyone."

While we were there, the town had fireworks (October) and the next day the street was closed off for a festival. Getting food is easy, dining is all local.
The house is located on an inclined street, the back yard is surrounded by a forest. There’s a washer and dryer in the basement. The house was very clean and has some great foods to wake up to. We had our dog and the price for for this rental was perfect.
Louise stocked the closets with towels and extra bed coverings. She also had extra fans, a baby gate, and mattresses.
Louise was a fantastic host. She was able to help me out with something, quick to respond, and quick to help out. What a great host!"

Stayed with kids","This is a fantastic rental and very reasonably-priced! We were two adults, a 10-year-old, and a dog and it was perfect for us. Really nice neighborhood for walking around in with the dog - there's a great trail system in one direction and a pleasant safe quiet neighborhood with a wide variety of houses for looking at. Town is close too but if you are walking just note it's a large hill from town to the house :) There was a lovely little back porch that looked into the yard - it's not a big yard but there was plenty of wildlife. We saw a good variety of birds and a fox, raccoon, and skunk!
The house was absolutely spotless and the kitchen very well-stocked with good-quality kitchenware. The couches were ridiculously comfortable and the shower was perfect. There was a great selection of books to read and games to play. Barre is a very central location for Vermont - we were there to visit friends in Shelburne and Montpelier, but we had time for some great bike rides and adventures in Barre itself. Just be aware that Barre is a very hilly town - you'll get your heart rate up for sure! (oh, and fun tip - there is a great skate park in town with nice hiking trails and a dog park in the same area). We would definitely stay again in a heartbeat!"

No problems with check-in or out, well-situated to walk to the shops on Barre's main street and just up the street is a lovely wooded path (about a mile or two in length) to walk dogs and/or yourselves. A pretty neighborhood. Excellent beds and a wonderfully and thoughtfully stocked kitchen--breakfast foods already there, lots of other foods in the cupboards and a whole spice rack's worth of great spices! Laundry facilities were more than ample for almost any-sized load. Toiletry baskets came in handy when I realized I forgot my toothbrush the first night. Louise was immediately responsive to one house emergency and it was resolved satisfactorily. For a stay in Central VT convenient to Montpelier, Burlington and the NE Kingdom, I would definitely recommend!"

The house is modern, extremely clean, and everything works perfectly. Beds are comfortable, kitchen is stocked great for cooking meals, and the space is very comfortable. In addition, the host has gone above and beyond to provide a great stay. There are so many little details that make this place great. The knives are sharp, there is every cooking utensil you could need, there are books and games and puzzles, soap and toothbrushes in case you forgot to pack something, she has provided chargers everywhere for devices, WiFi is fast and phone service is good. The smart TV is even set to guest mode so that you can sign into your Netflix, Hulu, etc accounts and it will auto sign you out when you leave. Every need you have has been anticipated and provided for. We really felt relaxed and at home and will definitely return. Don’t think twice about booking."

The apartment was warm cozy and comfortable. Michael made us feel welcome from the first time we met! He invited us to look around the farm and view it at our leisure. We were hoping for piglets to be born when we were there as the big sow was close . It didn’t happen though !
When we left we hit the farm store one more time and bought more Canadian bacon, ground beef, sausage and eggs ."

Stayed a few nights","""Our stay here was exactly what we were looking for when we chose Mike's farm !
Perfectly secluded scenic getaway but close enough to shopping.
The vast landscape offered us the time off and stay we needed. The store below has fresh meats, which we used for a homemade Shepards Pie. You make not want store bought meats after tasting the meat here. Clearly cleaner and more tastier. We also got some fresh eggs thar we used the whole stay. The place is immaculate and the right size for us although it could comfortably also accommodate another couple. Lots of towels and good amounts of blankets and linens. All necessities you'd find in your own home were available. We didn't need for anything. We watched Prime Video series at night on the TV.
We got a chance to meet the cows and pigs. Mike is a very generous and welcoming host.
Would definitely visit again.
Thank you for hosting a beautiful memory"

Upon arrival, I was already exhausted from a long day -and was so pleasantly surprised by how close Michael's place was to the towns of Barre, VT and/ or Montpelier, VT-but also tucked away and well-hidden in a quiet, serene setting. Check-in was beyond easy; the apartment was SUPER clean. We really love things clean and tidy, and Michael's did not disappoint. The floors, the bathrooms, the bedrooms - everything was great. The shower had amazing water pressure, again super welcoming after a long, tiring day. Again, it was QUIET and we slept great both nights we stayed at Michael's....

The space was very roomy and we appreciated having the deck to work and relax on. Also, having a farm stand located directly below was a huge plus - nothing beats fresh eggs and bacon in the morning. We look forward to visiting again!"

Stayed a few nights","Mike's farm is sort of like the bar in Cheers - not everyone knows your name, but they're definitely glad you came and that welcome (and their heating system) keeps you warm even in the coldest of winter nights. This time around, we were lucky enough to have arrived soon after a litter of piglets, so we got to admire their adorableness any time of day. Truthfully, if we lived in a spot where pigs were allowed as pets, that little runt would've been ours. Overall, the stay was exactly what we needed - relaxation, peacefulness, and furry familial cuteness on tap. We'll be back again 100%"

Stayed a few nights","Fantastic! Above and beyond. Mike is really a super host! He even gave us a tour of his farm and taught us a few tricks about eggollgy (knowledge of eggs), different chickens and birds and what to expect their eggs to look like and kinda taste. His place was super convenient and accessible. We had everything. Bed was comfortable and kitchen had all we needed. We chose to buy some of his meat from the farm and are now taking it to Kansas with us to enjoy with our children and grandkids. We did not need to do anything for cleanup, except to take off our shoes fir hood reasons, but we did anyway since we appreciated the hospitality. Looking forward to taking the family there next spring, especially the kids so they learn about farming. Good luck with his new projects."

Stayed a few nights","My cousins review-
There are many words to describe this place, the thoughts that come to mind are county-bumpkin, relaxation in the country, and family friendly. I thoroughly loved and enjoyed this amazing property, it is a MUST if you’re in the area. The host is beyond flexible - he took time out of his busy day to show us the cows up close. He shared the history of the farm and when we asked questions he responded enthusiastically. He also let us hold, pet and feed the piglets who were a few months old. This farm is run by the family, they have an amazing store directly below the place you will be staying and it is stocked full of goodies. You are very close to town - 10 minutes tops. Overall, this place is a home away from home, we can not wait to return and stay here again!!!!
My review-
This is my #1 favorite stay so far! 100stars at the least. The farm is so cute and mike and his wife are so welcoming and helpful. I would move in if they let me. Will be visiting atleast 3x a year. The pigs and cows are so sweet and i cant wait to return!! Booking another trip in afew days :)"

We walked around the farm when arrived then sat on our little deck and enjoyed a cold beer while watching the sheep graze.
Our 13 year old daughter was able to help with farm chores and had a blast.

Stayed with kids","My wife and I have only been to one AirBnB before this and we thought we got lucky with how nice the first one was but this experience was second to none! I have always told people that in another life I would live and work on a farm and this getaway was a great way to experience a little slice of that lifestyle. More importantly it was the first trip for our 5-month old daughter and this was a perfect way for us to share our love of animals with her. Michael was an extremely welcoming host, very friendly and outgoing to make sure we felt comfortable and had everything we need. The unit was as clean as you could hope for given the understanding that it's right above an active barn. The sounds and smells that some other reviews have mentioned were so minimal and in fact only added to the charm. We will definitely be recommending this place to our friends and family and will be coming back when our daughter gets a little older and can interact with the animals more. We cannot thank Michael and his family enough for making this a wonderful trip that we will remember for a lifetime!"

Stayed with kids","An amazing farm stay experience for my husband and I, and our kids 3 and 8. The upstairs apartment was spotless, the bedroom was comfortable, the pullout bed in the living area was perfect for our kids. The fully equipped kitchen was wonderful and we loved the self-serve farm store downstairs where we bought sausage and fresh eggs for our breakfast. Kids got to spend time with the farm animals, ‘helping’ with the piglets and petting the hens, ducks, sheep and runty bull calf. They also enjoyed sledding, but we didn’t manage to get out for snowshoeing which you can do right out the door. It was interesting having the pigs temporarily housed in the barn adjacent/below our apartment as temperatures dropped unseasonally to -13 the night we arrived - they are rambunctious haha. Best part of our stay was Michael, generous with his time and friendly welcoming personality. This farm is a gem just five minutes from Montpellier and 45 minutes from Burlington. Do not miss out on this unique farmstay!"

Stayed one night","Wicked Bines Farm is a trip into a world of peacefulness, mindfulness and animals. You just can’t go wrong there.
Michael has stocked the house with just about everything (including the kitchen sink, obviously) - the bath towels are super comfy and soft, the kitchen is large and has pots, pans and every utensil you might need, and the bed is clean, comfy and plush with blankets and pillows to spare.
Down under your apartment is a self-serve store with fresh eggs and all the meat you may want, freshly packed and frozen. Just leave anything in the fridge overnight and enjoy farm fresh bacon or sausage in the morning :)
Michael was also super friendly and personable, taking us for a ride on his 4x4 ranger to see the cows and let us feed the pigs and help collect and clean the chicken eggs. Hearing the ducks, pigs squeal, and the roosters in the morning was amazing, and overall our trip was both entertaining and educational, an experience we won’t forget and will definitely be back again to re-live next year when it’s warmer :)
The one thing I would say to watch out for is that you need to IGNORE GOOGLE if it tells you to drive through Vine to get to Wicked Bines Farm. We tried following Google our first night there and ended up stuck in a muddy field. Even then, Michael was super gracious, and he and his cousin came and saved us and our car. So 10000 points to the farm, Michael, his cousin, and a newfound appreciation for farming life :)"

And stocked up in their farm store for our breakfast 😋 The bacon is delicious!"

Stayed a few nights","Michael and Cindy's place is just as described. The place was immaculate and has everything you need. There were some fresh eggs in the fridge from the chickens that call this farm home sooooo good. We purchased some of the maple bacon that was incredibly delicious and bought some meats to bring home. The animals are fun to watch and Mike gives you time and answers any questions you might have about the farm. We will be back and if you are looking for a quiet, and peaceful Air B&B stay here! 5 stars"

Stayed a few nights","We stayed at Mike's farm for a long weekend in October and had a great stay! The apartment was clean and had everything you could need plus a deck looking over the farm. Mike was in great communication with us and even introduced us to all the animals and the produce in his shop. The location of the stay was perfect, a quick 5 minute drive to downtown Montpelier close to all the restaurants and right off the main road. It was also an easy drive to all of our sight seeing being a couple hikes and to Burlington. Would definitely recommend this stay, we had a wonderful time!"

The kitchen was fully stocked with just about all the cookware, utensils etc you could need for cooking a nice meal. I only wish we had more time to stay and enjoy the amenities. Michael was a great host!"

My wife and I won't forget our experience with Michael and Cindy. We loved being on the farm/animals, their hospitality/friendliness, and a great place to stay. They even sell fresh meat and eggs in a store they own below the stay. Overall we want to come back in the future and loved their place!"

Michael’s farm is so beautiful and staying right above his farm store was such an unique and fun experience. We were on a long New England trip and the bed was by far the most comfortable. It’s super close to Montpelier and anything you need. We loved it!

Michael gave us a tour of the farm in the morning and some suggestions on places to go at our next stop. The space was clean and just what we needed. Definitely stop here if you're in the area. Plan to stay a little longer so that you can explore the awesome farm and pet some of the animals!"

The animals were no bother at all. I never heard or smelled them. The place is very conveniently located depending on what you're planning to do. If we ever come back to Vermont we'll try and stay here again.

Stayed a few nights","This is such a cute place. It is a working farm, so know that it comes with the expected animal sounds and smells. But that is easily adjusted to and part of the charm. The apartment was plenty private and well-appointed. He provided a variety of flavors for the Keurig! Michael even provided some fresh eggs from his chickens. As soon as we arrived he gave us a tour of the pigs and ducks and sheep and cows. In the morning I went for a run along the farm trail and through the woods to a gorgeous view. Michael had great recommendations. The location is close enough to town to easily go out for dinner, but isolated enough that it feels like you’re far from other people. Michael is a genuinely good human being and does a lot of good and service for the community."

Stayed a few nights","This was a truly unique experience. Mike and Cindy are both incredibly warm and inviting hosts. The accommodations are clean, comfortable and modern.
The farm itself and the animals were so fun though! We we're greeted by hens, ducks and turkeys when we arrived. A couple of the pigs had given birth the week before we arrived so there were tons of piglets around. Additionally, one of the pigs gave birth while we were there so we were able to chill out with the newborn piglets.
Having the store right on property was fantastic. We had fresh eggs and bacon for breakfast every morning. And sitting on the balcony watching the ducks. Wish we'd stayed longer to grill up some of the brats and sample more of the available options.
We will definitely be looking to come back again for a longer stay."

Stayed a few nights","The apartment is spacious and extremely clean. You will have access to free range, eggs, pork, and beef from the farm store downstairs. You will also have an amazing balcony that overlooks the front yard with a view of the free range animals. It was wonderful to drink a coffee and watch the animals roam around in the morning. You also have cows in the backyard, and there are pigs in the barn right next to your front door. We were lucky enough to see 3 batches of piglets born during our visit, it was so special! The host Michael was exceptional. He was friendly and gave us the best recommendations. We really enjoyed staying here and would highly recommend this place! Book it, you will not regret it!"

Stayed a few nights","A rural Vermont dream! Our stay at Michael’s working farm was simply awesome. He was very generous and gave us a tour around all 200 acres of property when we arrived, and we were free to interact with the many pigs, cows, turkeys, ducks, sheep, and chickens galore! It was a very unique experience and I highly recommend it if you’re passing through northern Vermont. I recommend bringing a freezer bag if you’d like to take home any of his fresh meats, eggs, or honey, and also recommend a reservation at the nearby Barr Hill distillery, where we sells his eggs for use in some of the cocktails! We can’t wait to return!"

Stayed one night","We have stayed in a lot of fantastic places. Many of them have been Our last #1 was an apartment in a 1911 Amory in Napoleon, Ohio.
On this trip, we were traveling throughout New England on a week's vacation. We now have wonderful memories of our stay and a new #1 on our AirBnB list.
Gracious hosts, a great place, and a wonderful story to tell about the farm.
Having grown up raising cattle, hogs, and produce, we loved the place. My grandparents had a layer house, and I helped feed the chickens and gather eggs many times. The room was spotless, the bed was comfortable and we had several great talks with the family.
All our best for their family farming operation!"
