My brother’s infant grand baby was with us, and we all felt very comfortable. The beds were comfy & the entire townhouse was clean. I also asked if we could do early check-in, Peter was very responsive & accommodating. Definitely would recommend Peter’s townhouse. It is close to everything in the Greenville area. Don’t hesitate - book it!"

Stayed a few nights","Freshly updated and it shows. As a frequent traveler, you set your expectations low when a place is described as excellent. Well, this place didn’t disappoint. Fresh paint, new furniture, clean, well appointed and super convenient. Peter did a great job on ensuring he checked all the boxes. He was an excellent communicator and proactively provided me updates leading up to check in. Check in day was no different. I woke up to everything I needed to know upon arrival. Id highly recommend commend his condo if you’re in the Greenville aera and want a safe, clean, roomy condo. Convenient, but far enough away that you felt like you could relax at the end of the day. Thanks for making parents weekend at ECU one to remember."

In researching hotels, we were not pleased with our options, so we looked on here and narrowed it down to this amazing host and home! Why, no pets, lol. I’m highly allergic and the other home allowed pets. From the moment we walked into the space we were in awe and felt at-home. We absolutely loved the house and told all of our friends and family the same. We told them to share it with friends and loved ones coming into town, as it would be better than any hotel! This will be the only place we stay when we come back home. 💙"

I'm so glad we booked Abhishek's property - everything was clean, modern, and super comfortable - great for hunkering down over the weekend. Furniture was comfortable and the kitchen was very well stocked. We've been to ECU several times now and this was definitely the nicest place (and area) we've stayed at.

Pros:
Spacious home and very clean
10 min drive to ECU
Quiet neighborhood
Responsive host, within 1min
TV in all 3 bedrooms
Close to shopping centers and mall
Comfy beds
Host checked in on us to see if we needed anything
Cons:
Carpet upstairs in the bedrooms...per host rules you must take your shoes off. No shoes on carpet.
Overall when we visit Greenville again, we plan to stay here. I must say this is the best Airbnb we have stayed in."

Todd's whole package is outstanding- super clean, very well decorated, lots of amenities (even if I didn't have time to enjoy), lots of snacks available, chocolates and bottled water in the room.
Really is top notch and should be the gold standard for ABnB. If you are considering opening an ABnB you truly should come here for some startup lessons.
Todd is super friendly and communicates / responds quickly and clearly.
I will recommend this to anyone needing a place to stay in Greenville or just for a getaway to relax.
I will be back."

We had bad weather in the area and he made sure I made it safely, checking on me. The house was very well decorated, organized, clean and full of amenities. He had everything I needed plus me. I highly recommend this place. Five Stars isn’t enough!"

We will be visiting again in the summer to use the awesome looking pool and hot tub."

Stayed a few nights","Guys!!! I’m 23 and me and my boyfriend stayed here for the weekend visiting my dad and grandma. This place is not like any other bnb. The host was super friendly and active . He made my stay in North Carolina the best. The amenities, the views of the lights at night, and the fire pit. The setup of everything was beautiful. I also brought my grandma and dad and a few cousins to come and chill there and the host was super cool with it. He even interacted with them playing cards, talking, and so much more. This bnb is for ALL Age groups. You will absolutely LOVE IT!! If you booking just to relax this is the place for you, if your booking for the looks and aesthetics this is the place for you. It don’t matter what you’re there for this bnb offers everything. I guarantee you will have the most amazing time there from the time you arrive. The host again was beyond AMAZING and helpful and really laid back. So What y’all hesitating for?? BOOK!!! BOOK!! BOOK!! You will not be disappointed."

Todd’s has added special touches to his property that consisted of making it a smart home, beautiful inside and outside decorated lights, huge televisions, comfortable bed, techno lit bathroom fixtures and includes a whirlpool tub and waterfall shower and an outside pool and hot tub to enjoy. You felt safe at this location which was close to the events we had to attend. Overall a great location and place to stay in Greenville. There’s no other place for us when we return!"

Cabinets held necessities in dishware .Bathroom was as expected with plenty of towels,washcloths, and hand towels,soaps and shampoo and hairdryer . It was extra cold this weekend and Mike mentioned there was an extra heater to use as we needed, a truly nice touch. Plenty of usb places to plug in any devices for charging as well as surge protection receptacles. We would truly stay at Mike’s place again! Thanks Mike!"

I had given Mike a little private feedback and I immediately noticed he had made the small changes that made a huge difference! I will definitely be back. Perfect space for one or two travelers.

Stayed a few nights","We had a very pleasant stay in the Bach Double room in The Music House, hosted by Dr. John O'Brien, a faculty member of the East Carolina University School of Music. The Music House is located in Uptown Greenville, conveniently within walking distance of ECU and the Tar River Park. The mansion was built in 1902 for Jesse R. Moye, a successful merchant, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. The house is beautifully furnished and features John's extensive collection of musical instruments and a large room for hosting concerts and community events. Guests have access to two parlors in the front of the house as well as a charming wrap-around porch. Our private bedroom on the second floor included a comfortable 1860s Queen-size bed and a quaint 1920s tiled bath. Although a continental breakfast was provided, we chose to have brunch at two excellent restaurants nearby. John was a gracious host and welcomed us into his home. We would definitely stay there again."

Was able to use a small desk antique desk in the room. There are plenty of opportunities for making coffee/tea, getting snacks, using a small mini fridge, and breakfast is superbly appointed in a dining room fit for visiting royals. This is not to mention all the musical instruments adorning the hallways and music hall, where John was happy to indulge my curiosities about his musical background. Been to many unique Airbnbs, but the interior here is certainly one of the most memorable - don't miss a chance to stay here."

John’s hospitality, his awareness to detail, and his thoughtfulness to make sure our stay was the best it could be did not go unnoticed. Almost every night we sat in the parlor and just soaked in our surroundings and on two of those nights we were able to enjoy the beautiful sounds of music being played on the piano. This Airbnb is definitely one of a kind and you won’t be disappointed."

Stayed a few nights","Everything about my two day retreat at the Music Box was perfect. It literally is like stepping back in time, and each time I entered the foyer or walked into my room, it was like a welcome home hug. I was continually finding new delights to enjoy. It truly is amazing how many upgrades and thoughtful conveniences John has provided for his guests. For example, a small table right by the door for your keys and glasses… A coffee table with granite top, so I was not worried about putting a hot mug or dripping water on it… a little teapot so I could sit in bed with a book and enjoy my own little tea time…. Snacks and fresh fruit at any time of day… Plenty of towel rack space…. Hangers in the armoire… good lighting… instructions on how to properly close the curtains so the room was blacked out… not to mention the quality of the curtains (gorgeous and heavy)… multiple pillow choices to choose from (hard/soft)… heated tile floor and toilet seat in the bathroom! John’s responsiveness: 10 stars!"

Stayed a few nights","It's like stepping back in time! Charming home with thoughtful touches and very comfortable! The host, John, is attentive and quick to respond. After finding out I'm a coffee lover he made it a point to have my favorite, dark roast, and a small coffee pot in my room. I had forgotten about the heated bathroom floors and toilet seat, and it was surprising how these amenities made my stay just that much better. The Music House is an amazing Victorian style home that is rich in local history with original woodwork, period pieces, and musical instruments everywhere you look. But, it can also be a little chilly! Room and bed very cozy - and not being cold when you step out of the shower in December? Priceless!! This will be my choice anytime I'm in Greenville. If you want to unplug and relax this is the place to stay!"

Anyone who pays a higher nightly cost to stay in an anonymous hotel as opposed to staying in this luxurious, beautiful, peaceful, unique, and relaxing historical home is a fool in my opinion. John’s stately, gorgeous, restored in period perfection, fully functioning, Victorian home is like staying in a late 1800’s interactive museum, but with modern climate control and air quality, and the most pampering coffee, snack, and bathroom Amenities you could want for. I will always check for room at John’s Music House before staying anywhere else. Don’t think twice - book it."

Stayed a few nights","John is an extremely gracious host and was willing to help in way possible to make my stay more comfortable. He was attentive to smaller details that others might have taken for granted and showed a genuine motivation to provide anything that would improve the quality of my stay. I felt I had all I needed during his stay and he mostly stayed out of the way unless I needed something, which was rare. His home is beautiful and the room I stayed in was just superior. The bed was most comfortable and the area was generally quiet, which allowed for quality rest. Everything was very clean and well organized. If I were visiting the Greenville area, I would not hesitate to book with him again and would recommend The Music House to others."

Stayed one night","There really aren't words for how magical this place is. If you're a lover of antiques, art, & luxury you've come to the right place. The location is perfect for walking ""uptown"" or to ECU's campus but also convenient to the highway for arrivals and departures. The garden and porch are delightful. The check-in, rainbow bunting, security, and Covid protocols all led me to feeling very safe and welcome. The room was perfectly appointed with all the beautiful things carefully considered plus sheets and a mattress that felt like a dream. The bathroom was one of my favorite aspects of the stay with a seat warmer, bidet, gorgeous chrome vintage style fittings and under-floor heating. When I told John I just needed strong coffee for breakfast, he went out and bought some Peets especially for me. Having grown up in Greenville and seen this particular area change over the years, I believe the city owes John a debt of gratitude for the way he has cared for this architectural masterpiece. I would highly recommend this Airbnb to absolutely anyone - I've traveled the world and this is top 5 places I've ever stayed - simply perfect."

Stayed a few nights","Chuck and Judy are excellent hosts. They are so kind, accommodating and gave us the freedom to come and go and maintain our privacy in their home. The house is immaculate and feels like home. Little touches like bottled water, coffee, fresh blueberries and tea were extra thoughtful and appreciated. A relaxing and welcoming home! We hope to be able to stay again."

Stayed a few nights","My boyfriend and I recently stayed with C&J for the ECU and UNC football game. We arrived Friday evening and were greeted by both! They have a wonderful home and showed us up to our room. They offered plenty of water bottles as well as a coffee nook upstairs with a Keurig coffee machine, tea bags, creamer, mugs, etc (everything you need!). They also offer a small breakfast in the morning which is laid out on the counter or in their fridge on their ""Airbnb"" rack! We loved that there were homemade muffins out on the counter and they were a great snack on the way home. C&J were wonderful hosts and unfortunately we did not get to spend as much time getting to know them because of the busy football weekend. I would recommend this home to anyone visiting ECU! Hopefully we will be back for another football game. Thank you!"

The hosts were very responsive and accommodating throughout our stay. The house is extremely organized and clean. From pulling up to the gate and seeing the 2 horses, to the minute you drive down the gravel driveway, you will be transformed into what seems like the set of a romantic and whimsical movie set. We had a few friends over for a small bbq during Family Weekend at ECU and I won't be surprised if everyone took some design tips from their beautifully decorated house. I felt blessed to sit on the front porch swing and sip my coffee each morning watching the chickens, ducks and adorable farm cats (Finn & Tink). I didn't want to leave the tranquility and I'll definitely be back."

The house was spacious and the rooms beautifully arranged and decorated--someone has a serious eye for detail! It is quiet and peaceful but a quick drive in to town to 'do things'. If you are an early riser you can catch a family of deer on the lawn or a great blue heron on the pond. The cats (Tink and Finn, we're sending you virtual scritches) went a long way towards helping our kids with missing our own kitties."

Everything about this home and property was beyond our expectations. We traveled from CA and found the property to be centrally located to Raleigh-Durham and the coast. We will be back!

Stayed a few nights","The essentials were fine...cleanliness, comfortable beds and location. These are by far the most important things, but I feel I should provide some other insight. It is hard to imagine that a real architect designed the townhouse. After taking in a tight downstairs layout we headed up steep steps and were surprised to find two very spacious bedrooms. BUT the master bathroom was absurd. It too had a spacious footprint but the toilet ""closet"" was so crammed that no one could possibly sit on the toilet with the door closed. This left you exposed to the entire bedroom because there was no door to the bathroom area. And the shower stall was literally phone booth size. That being said, one could just go use the very normal private bath off the guest room...if you do not have guests. Also, we never figured out how to effect any change in the household temperature as it had some sort of lock on it. The info book on coffee table gave directions but I guess we just did not understand."

The Master bedroom also has a roomy bathroom. It also faces the back, so it was quiet. The other room, with its own bathroom, was not used much but was a real plus for a short visit from my son.

Stayed over a week","Super convenient for traveling to and from the hospital. The townhouse was a bit less clean than the pictures suggest (i.e. rusty pipes at toilets, broken blinds in kitchen slide door). The layout of the master bathroom is so odd. There’s no separate door to the bathroom from the bedroom and the water closet only has room for the toilet/not your legs. It was uncomfortable but it was great having the other bathrooms as options. The water temperature wasn’t always consistent but it worked. This location was great for my husband’s work month. DoorDash was his friend and offered plenty of great options in the area. He LOVED the comfy master bed which was a great place for him to rest before heading to work again. Becky was easy to talk with and helped guide us to finding some things during this trip. Thank you for this bnb Becky."

House was clean, beds were comfy, and we found everything we needed in the kitchen
My only very very minor suggestion would be that there be a few more bathroom towels.
Will definitely recommend to others!"
