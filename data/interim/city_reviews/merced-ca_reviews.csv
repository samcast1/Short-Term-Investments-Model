Stayed a few nights","the house was easy to find. The neighborhood looks nice and tidy and is quiet. The car can be parked well on the street/parking in front of the house. Entering through the keypad works fine. The house is beautiful, tidy and clean. All in all, a nice stay to be and privacy is guaranteed."

Stayed a few nights","Overall the place is great, it gets the job done. The inside of the place was very neat and clean which is always a good indicator. We did have a few things that made us not give it a 5 star. For example, the tv wasn’t working at all our entire stay. The thermostat wasn’t working either which sucked a lot because Merced is super hot already! There wasn’t a trash can in the kitchen which would be an easy fix of course but overall it got the job done."

We really enjoyed staying there. Kemi and Paul were quick to resolve all problems/questions we had. Brought us a coffee maker and hair blow dryer right away because we couldn’t find any at all. They are very very nice people. We would highly recommend this place if anyone is visiting Merced or Atwater or need a place to stay in that area. We would go back to this place again if it’s just me and the husband visiting. Thank you Kemi and Paul!!"

The house was spic and span once I arrived and everything is there that you need to make you feel comfortable. Although, I never met them in person, the host was very responsive to any concerns that I had. If the city wasn't so boring and if they had more hospitals to choose from to work I would have extended my contract mainly bc of the convenience of my housing. This house/apt helped me get thru being away from home and away from my family and friends. You won't regret reserving a spot with them!"

As others have mentioned, you definitely hear people in the house but it wasn’t a bother and the hosts are respectful of quiet hours. Appreciated having a washer and dryer to use. Yosemite and Pinnacles National Parks are about 1.5-2 hours away, worked great for long day trips."

Stayed a few nights","Book it. Before the pandemic, I traveled a lot. I have never seen a place as spic and span as this completely mother-in-law unit attached to the main house. This is a standard of cleanliness that is a cut above. I don’t think of Merced --where I went to Junior College—as a romantic destination. Many will be there to visit family as I was or for something related to the University. This accommodation was absolutely perfect and completely self-contained. The appliances all look like they were delivered yesterday, so new are they. Although it was 96 degrees outside, the unit has central air and ceiling fans and I remained comfortably cool the entire time. It has its own private entrance which is easily accessed without the necessity of keys through a numeric key pad. Other reviewers have mentioned ambient sounds from the host family in the main house. No question. At times you will hear signs of life from next door including the indistinct voice of a child. If you are here for a honeymoon getaway, this may not be your cup of tea. However, when it counts —when it’s time to wind down for bed and throughout the night— this place is as quiet as a tomb. You are unlikely to find a more quiet place for when it counts. There is a delightful little park 60 seconds away and the entire neighborhood is a quiet and safe oasis. Single women traveling will especially appreciate this aspect. Although in a newer and non-central part of town, that, for me, we as desirable for its peace and tranquility. You will have a car and can quickly get anywhere in this small town you care to go. The hosts could not have been kinder or more responsive. Make sure you open the hallway closest as I did not until five minutes before I left. Brand new washer/dryer for you inside with enough soap etc for a single wash (so bring some laundry supplies with you). I am so glad that I chose this accommodation and am pleased that I in a small way supported a fine, working family rather than a distant corporation by staying in motel row. This felt more like a house than a hotel room as it is quite large."

The color palette of the space is earthy, so it’s calming :) I appreciate the L shaped couch, the big closet space, the press...I could go on 😄 The space is private. The neighborhood is safe and clean. There’s also a park nearby, so you can walk around the neighborhood. I didn’t get a chance to meet the hosts but they seem kind and hospitable. Seems like they love hosting people and want the experience of the person who stays here to be a good one. Thanks, Kemi and Paul!"

Stayed about a week","Kemi and Paul's Airbnb was wonderful. The neighborhood looks new, and is peaceful, safe, and quiet. There is a large neighborhood park across the street and plenty of street parking. The space itself was very private, comfortable, and tastefully decorated. The bed was comfortable, the fridge and microwave were large and clean, and they even provided some small appliances (hot plate and coffee maker). There is also a very nice, late model private washer and dryer which were a huge bonus for us. This was not only very convenient, but so much cleaner and more effective than a laundromat. Everything was very clean.
Another reviewer mentioned hearing a child in the main unit. It's true that if you require total silence in your living space, you should be aware that this is unit is part of their house so you may occasionally hear the normal sounds of life through the walls. Overall our experience was very private and quiet.
Thank you Kemi and Paul!"

Everytime I tried to go back to sleep, I could hear screaming and shouting. This is why I knocked one star off."

Stayed with kids","Very clean and well maintained. The property seemed recently renovated and there were nice updates like no touch soap and trash barrels, remote controlled blinds, and smart dimmers.
Marcus and Amara were very responsive and welcomed us with a nice note and welcome basket.
The home is in a quiet area. We could read by the pool and be to downtown Merced restaurants within 6-8 minutes, and Modesto is about 40-45 minutes. Also very central to UC Merced for anyone visiting the campus.
The home was spacious and we were able to keep our luggage stored and out of the way. A true home experience with timely landscaping and pool maintenance. Great linens, comfortable beds, and furniture.
Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a quiet, well-appointed home experience that is still central to Merced attractions or a moderate ride to Yosemite, etc."

Stayed with kids","My wife, myself and our two frenchies Leeloo and Zoe were in Merced to visit my inlaws and decided to book this house as it was less than 2 miles to thier house and had a pool. Upon arrival check in was extremely seamless and when walking in we immediately noticed how clean the home smelled and how neat and tidy it was.
There are instructions on how to use all the smarthome features mounted in little frames throughout the house which we thought was very cool and helpful.
The kitchen had all we need to cook a nice meal, and the weber kettle grill came in handy to grill up some steaks by the pool.
The pool was very clean, and Target is not far from the home. They had the pool toys we needed!
Overall we highly recommend this home for anyone looking for a little getaway and is visiting Merced.
Well be back for sure!"

Stayed a few nights","Marcus walked us through the whole process exceedingly well and made our stay during my son’s engagement a memorable one. The house was very homely, clean and neatly maintained with many modern amenities. Kitchen, bed rooms, living room and bath rooms were crispy clean. Sheets were fresh. Baths were stocked as mentioned. Linen and towels were clean. The place is reasonably priced and is in a nice safe neighborhood. It’s accessible to many grocery stores and pharmacies.
The pool was nice and welcoming but we had no time to use it. Maintenance personnel were around and it was mentioned ahead so we knew it. We didn’t feel much intruded. Marcus was very accessible at every step and we truly didn’t have any issues after checkin. The best part was finding a welcome note with a bottle of wine waiting for us 🥰! We are totally sold and will HIGHLY recommend this place to stay. All our future visits are going to be here, more so with new family here. Giving a 10 out of 5 stars ⭐️ !!

Stayed one night","My family (two parents with two adult children) needed a place to stay in Merced because of a family event nearby. Marcus' place suited us perfectly - we were very very comfortable and spent a quiet, peaceful night before our event the next day. We appreciated the book Marcus put together with information about restaurants and attractions in the immediate area. We weren't able to use all the amenities such as the pool or barbeque area - but these looked very inviting and if we were in the area during the warmer months we would certainly have taken advantage of those things! A few notable items: the pillows and towels were especially soft and luxurious; the kitchen was well supplied for basic breakfast preparation; the heating and lighting worked very well and we got the place warmed up quickly on a cold evening."

Nice, safe, quiet neighborhood. The cleanliness was next level and very much appreciated. Communication was quick and on point... Thank you Marcus for the nice note and wonderful bottle of wine! Decorative touches throughout the house provided for a very warm and cozy stay. The rooms were beautifully decorated and the house was spacious, comfortable, and modern. It is a wonderful home, perfect for a family vacation. We went to our daughter's graduation from UC Merced and Marcus house wash the perfect home for our family. We highly recommend this house. You won’t regret staying here! Best Airbnb!"

The house just begs you to lounge everywhere. Plush surfaces for days. The master suite is like its own wing. Every room is so clean. The kitchen is well designed. The stone tile is pure luxury. My only gripe is I don't have another night to spend here."

Stayed with kids",So let me start off by saying I have used Airbnb for years and never had an issue this last year I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 1 and severe anxiety attacks that lead to seizures my husband and I decided to get a service dog to alert me before an attack we decided to take a family vacation to start of the new year somewhere new and fun and thank god for Marcus because every other host either told me I couldn’t stay or I would be charged extra cleaning fees because of my service dog I was starting to feel very discouraged and ashamed of my disability I decided to ask one more place which was Marcus’s beautiful home and wow he literally made me cry when he answered me back within 5 min of messaging him that he would love to have us and my service dog with no problem and waived the pet fee any questions or concerns I had was answered promptly and at late hours he was still responsive he let us check in early his home was beautiful and clean and he even had a dog bowl set up for Olaf he talked with us and even helped us bring our bags in he understood my disability and was accommodating In every way after dealing with hosts who have made me embarrassed and ashamed of my disability it was truly heartwarming and I am even crying as I write this review because Marcus truly made our family vacation possible and the best way to bring in the new year thank you Marcus we can not wait to come back

Stayed with kids",This was the first time we have ever got an airbnb and it was definitely worth it we had so much fun. It was so nice the rooms had great A/C and the 9ft deep pool was a lot of fun. Also is very close to everything. This home was amazing definitely will be back.

Stayed with kids",Marcus is an amazing super host he replied super fast to any questions that I had prior to my stay and during my stay. He left us goodies upon arrival. He is great with communicating anything you have questions about. He worked with me every step of the way it was my first time booking with Airbnb and he made it extremely easy. We had a great experience I am definitely going to be booking with him again. We came as a family Looking to enjoy some really great outside pool time that's exactly what we got. Neighbors are super friendly told my kids and myself to enjoy our stay! The pool is super clean its also deep which my kids loved. The house is very clean. Perfect size for a family of 6. Local food stores are right down the street super close overall great stay and I can't wait to stay here again.

He always had a rapid response and was literally available for our entire stay. The house was absolutely 💯% clean. Such a huge plus these days. I would highly recommend staying here if you are ever in the Merced area. My family and I definitely want to come back to this property soon. It was such a great experience and so relaxing at the same time. I honestly felt like home."

Group trip","The stay was very nice and homey. Wish we were able to use the pool but got back to the house late so we skipped on it. Marcus was very fast to respond (texted each other) and was there when I needed. The only suggestion that I would have is maybe add some blinds. I'm used to having blinds in the house, this one has blinds in the front of the house and in the bedrooms. The back yard and the bathrooms lacked blinds but other than that no issues with the stay. It has a nice glass table that seats 8 (but we didn't use). Where is located is a little weird, the street doesn't have stop signs so just drive slow and be careful when coming in and out of the neighborhood. The fridge is large and can store a good amount of stuff inside. He also supplied some soda, water bottles, and a bottle of wine for our stay. We will definitely be planning on coming back more often in the future because my in-laws live in Merced."

Stayed with kids","My 2 night stay to relax and get away was amazing at this house. First off I was a tad bit iffy about staying somewhere without a type of refund in the post, (I've stayed at many Airbnb's I'm a Healthcare Worker) but for this place, there is no need for a refund. The house is beautiful, roomy, and furnishings are right what was needed. I already knew how to use a smart house, I have one too, which was super nice to be familiar with how things worked and my own comfort. Marcus replies fast and is quite efficient. The pool was a perk too even though it was chillier weather, my little one still got in. I highly recommend this house if it's not booked and your going to that area, jump on it and don't wait. 5 stars for sure!!!"

He even had a real Christmas tree and decorations up, which I thought was a nice touch especially when people are traveling over the holidays...it made it very homey. He was easy to get a hold of when we had a question, he was quick to respond and was cheerful and helpful. My sister and I will be frequently traveling to Merced and are looking forward to staying at Marcus' home. In fact, it will be the only place we stay."

Stayed a few nights","This house was GORGEOUS inside and out! The photos don’t do his place justice. The house & backyard are much bigger than I expected! My dogs LOVED the yard. We did have to keep them out of the pool area though because there was a small hole in the fence they wouldn’t stay away from. The neighbors dogs barked allot, especially in the mornings. Unfortunately, it was too cold to swim in the pool when we visited & the spa didn’t heat up. But the inside of the home really made up for that! It was very clean when we arrived, and he also left us complimentary beverages including wine. Love the fact that almost the whole house can be controlled via voice command. The beds were super comfy. Master bathroom is HUGE, but the water doesn’t get very hot. Marcus was very communicative, thoughtful and a great host. If you have the chance to book this house, do!"

Stayed a few nights","I'm currently in the process of starting up a new business in Merced and I've been driving daily from Elk Grove. Often I would book a hotel in the location which has not always been the best experience so I decided to try Airbnb. This was my first time booking an AirBnB and was a bit disappointed, because my first attempts did not receive a response from hosts. A week later I gave the site one more try and this is when I found Marcus Place........
Well I have to say Marcus Place did not disappoint. I'm very into technology so the fact that the entire house had been upgraded to smart home features was plus. Also the home was very clean and in a great neighborhood. There's a nice size clean pool in the backyard with hot tube to match. Plus the added touch of bottled wine waiting for me really was great.
Upon returning the key I was a bit late because got called into the work early that morning, from which I text Marcus and he was totally fine with me dropping key off later in the day. While dropping key off, I was able to meet Mr. Marcus. Great down to earth you man who was very welcoming and pleasant to talk to. Needless to say, I will be staying at Marcus Place again in the near future.
Thanks again Marcus."

She knows I have a small treat for her upon arrival which helps, I am sure. Sherri is always responsive to any small request I may have. The last time I stayed, I left a shirt hanging. Upon return, it was neatly folded and placed in a safe baggie. Thank you, Sherri."

It was great for my visit home to Cali. Even when there were a few hiccups they were quick to help me or accommodate me. The yard was big and grassy. They also had a big playground and swing for my son to play(he didn’t but it was nice to have in case) I will definitely stay again on my next visit.
Only tiny downside was no tv which I didn’t realize until after but they had tons of books and it gave me a chance to disconnect a bit, which this momma needed."

They had a beautiful little coffee making bar and it was so nice to be able to just get up and make coffee and relax in the mornings before begin our journeys of the day of tourism.

Daniel and Lindsey were quick to respond, and when we encountered issues, they remedy them promptly. A couple things to be aware of are environmental light from the nearby shopping center which is not completely blocked by the blinds, and the train horn could interrupt sleep (though a noise machine goes a long way to helping with that)."

The beds were comfortable and the entire house was immaculate. We have only used Airbnb a few times, but this one will stand out for me and my family. Thank you so much for making our stopover so enjoyable."

We were here for a wedding which was really close from the home, so that was another great thing for us. If my family and I visit Merced again in the future we would definitely stay here."

Small touches were greatly appreciated- having shampoo and body wash, items in the fridge and small snacks. I was there for such a short time but needed these items!

Daniel went above and beyond as host too; during our stay, Merced experienced some of its worst flooding in generations. Daniel made sure that we felt secure in house during this time and offered to help us with anything we needed during this period. We'll always appreciate that. The combination of house and host makes this AirBnB a must-stay!"

The zen vibes of the front yard with the fountain, statues, and little birds that live in the trees was amazing. Visiting in fall was perfect. The trees lining the street and around the neighborhood were beautiful. We accommodated 10 people comfortably in their home. Daniel and Lindsey were both responsive and kind.

Me and my girlfriend only stayed for a night but Cheryl has plenty of space and it felt like home to us.
We chose the location because it’s so close to the Yosemite NP (2hr drive) but Merced is a really nice village and the weather is great if you like it hot in the summer, but don’t worry Cheryl’s place is cool, she has AC and multiple fans.
I also wanted to mention that Cheryl is a really responsive and friendly host. She gave us direction to the local stores and restaurants.
Overall a great experience! If I ever come back near this area I would totally visit her and Nacho, the chihuahua, again!
Thank you very much Cheryl :)"

She is a gracious, generous host and we enjoyed easy conversations along with her friend who was visiting. Fortunately for me there were 3 dogs present (usually only Cherly's sweet Chihuahau) and I was in doggie heaven.
The house was spacious, clean and the bed was comfy plus I had a private bathroom next to my bedroom supplied with shampoo, conditioner, hair dryer, etc. Parking was easy, right in front of house. Communication with Cheryl flowed as she always kept me posted. And when I left behind my tablet, she was quick to message me and ship it off the next day. When in Merced, don't think twice about booking here."

My toddler was comfortable and had plenty to do, my newborn slept great in the provided pack n’ play, my in-laws were comfortable, and my husband and I couldn’t have asked for more. The house is in a great location to restaurants and things to do. Beds are comfortable, the neighborhood is peaceful, and it was just a great spot. We will definitely book with Mary again when we come see family in Merced again!"

Stayed a few nights","Every year for the past few years, we bring my mother-n-law down from Washington to visit. She is from Merced and used to reside here until she was diagnosed with Dementia. Having a quite place for her to stay while she is town to visit with old friends is very important. The home hosted by Max was very pleasant and accommodating for our needs. Quite neighborhood, very clean house, and plenty of room. Way more room than we needed but for the price we couldn't pass it up. Was a little confused at first regarding the key pad, however Max was Johnnie on the spot and was able to assist me very quickly. Will not hesitate to stay at one of Max's residence again.
Thanks again Max"

Only suggestion I would have is bath handles for getting in and out of the tub would be appreciated by seniors like myself (with bad knees) and also my special needs adult son who travel with us. Otherwise this home is perfect! Certainly beats a hotel!"

Check in was easy and we were happy to take the trash out before check out (My adult children frequently stay at Airbnb's and they explained to me that you need to collect all linen from bath towels, to bed sheets and place them in a designated area of the house in some cases.
I am handicap and It's a chore for me to do all that on top of repacking and loading our vehicle for the trip back home.

Stayed a few nights","If you want to stay at a house that has a great working air conditioning unit and also has great insulation to keep the house cool in the hot times, this is a great place to be. My daughters slept very well in the rooms. The recommendations I have is to make the garage electric so that the guests can push the button on the wall so that the garage can be used easily. Other than that everything else was perfect. The washing machine is wonderful. Even the neighbors were nice. A neighbor came over and asked me if I could go to the backyard and get the ball that flew over the fence for the dog. I happily threw it over and he said, “thank you”. You don’t have to worry about critters or bugs because while I was there, someone came and sprayed outside. In the master bedroom and living room, it would be nice if the blackout curtains were placed at the sliding doors like all the other rooms. Overall it is a great home."

The decor of the home was gorgeous with photos of Half Dome/ Yosemite, the couch was great and plenty of room for six adults and two kids.

Group trip","Great place to stay and what you see in the pics is what you get. The park is near by just a little walk and it’s great for kids. The back yard is a decent size (we didn’t use it) but you can definitely do stuff back there if needed. I like natural lighting and in the morning there is tons of natural lighting. Equipped with what you need, felt the rooms were on the smaller end but hey, that’s just the new homes these days can’t get away from that. Other than that, great stay and I would totally do it again! A 5/5 Forsure!"

While we did pack our own toiletries and materials, the house was stocked with a lot of items (shampoo, body wash, etc). There are plenty of towels and linens. Max was quick to respond and very understanding in allowing us to have family over as we grieved. He also allowed us to have my sister’s small family stay with us for two nights (there were 8 of us total) for an extra fee (typically he doesn’t allow more than one family to stay at a time, but we had an unexpected situation arise, and he was flexible and accommodating in our tough situation). The backyard was perfect for our kids, and it was nice for them to have the space to run and play. Thanks for hosting us, Max!"

Stayed about a week","This is a very generous residence for a family, with a beautiful kitchen, dining and living room in a large, open space with high ceilings, three smaller bedrooms with queen beds, and a master suite with connected full bath. There’s a second full bath in the hallway between the bedrooms. The house has plenty of storage space, and is fully equipped to make oneself at home away from home. There’s also a nice back yard with dining furniture. All appliances and furnishings are new. It comes fully stocked with towels, linen, kitchen equipment, spices, and staples to get you started.
The neighborhood is as new as the home, and very peaceful and quiet, especially at night. I slept really well in the comfortable bed, and felt very safe and cozy.
Whatever it is that brings you to Merced, don’t miss the wildlife reserves. I saw hundreds of geese, pelicans, a huge variety of ducks, raptors, sparrows, herons and egrets, the rare Sandhill Cranes and Tule Elks… all just a 30 minutes drive away. Magical!
Communication with host Max was outstanding. He’s so accommodating, resourceful and helpful, and really wants you to have the best of times. I wanted to extend my stay because it was just so nice, but the house was booked. Max went out of his way with recommendations and suggestions, really fabulous.
In other words, highly recommended."

Stayed with kids","Ram’s house was spotless (minus the carpets), he responded very quickly to any questions I had and overall my family and I enjoyed our stay. The only issue we had (that is no fault to Ram) was that the neighbor next door had people living in an RV in front of their house for the duration of our stay. During this time they put their trash bins in from of the Airbnb, used the parking spots in front of the Airbnb, and would sit out on their lawn in pajamas at all hours of the day. It didn’t ruin our stay but was definitely unfortunate to see everyday."

My 1 year old did not fit in it, but we managed and my 1 year old slept comfortably. Other than the no complaints. Very clean and spacious just as described. Easy check in. Quiet community. Overall we had a wonderful stay and would definitely go back."

The new house is located in a quiet residential area in Merced. The house is very well equipped. The value for money is completely ok. We drove from Merced to Yosemite National Park, until you enter the park you need about 1:45 h. If you have no problem with that, you will find an optimal starting point in Ram's house, which I can only recommend."

Just the 3 bathrooms alone made this place a gem.
everything was super clean and comfortable. i never once felt grossed out by something here, which happens often in Airbnb's.
one warning though, if you like ABSOLUTE quite, one of the neighbors has a wind chime that is easily activated by even the SLIGHTEST breeze. and it was a breezy night. all night i could hear that chime going off. not the fault of the host though."

Love that the master bedroom has a sliding door to the backyard though. Only complaint was the shower in the master bedroom. Since there is no door between the shower and rest of the room, stepping out of the shower felt cold regardless how warm the house was. Would definitely consider staying here again!"

We do wish there were more pillows and towels, however there were washer and dryer access if we needed. It was useful to us . We didn’t use the kitchen as we were exploring the town’s restaurants. Everything was very clean. We purchased more toilet paper not realizing there was extra in the bathroom drawer in one restroom and more in garage. I think if you have questions, just ask the host . We loved our stay and can’t wait to visit again!"

We only fixed breakfast there but the kitchen is sparsely equipped. (not enough cutlery, cups, etc for 8 people. Space was somewhat impersonal just like a hotel would be, but much more space than any suite hotel would offer.
Due to construction on 99 and 3 closed exits, the house could only be reached after a 15-minute detour. Overall a good experience, I would recommend it to others."

Stayed one night","Our three person group moving from Oregon to LA got a great night’s sleep at Ram’s spacious house. Very comfortable beds! It was very luxurious having our own bedrooms and bathrooms. This was a good value for us and would be a truly exceptional value for a larger group (the house sleeps 8 comfortably, in real beds). There’s no character to the house as it is brand new, in an enormous new homogeneous development, and sparsely furnished. But that was evident in the pictures and information so no surprises there. It has a small outdoor area but it hasn’t been landscaped yet. We really liked being able to put our two cars inside the garage and to spread out on the large comfy couch to watch movies. A note to anyone with chemical sensitivities— the house smells like laundry detergent— it’s very evident as soon as you walk in. Ram was excellent to communicate with and very accommodating, which we really appreciated. All in all a great stay—just what we were looking for!"

Stayed a few nights","the pictures doesn't do justice how lavish this house really is... it's a home away from home.. he has snacks ready, things to bathe with everything to make you stay comfortable I have 10 out of 10 for him and everything is amazing. this is my first time using Airbnb, and he said the standards high for everybody else. this house gave my family a good peace of mind while visiting."

Stayed about a week","This was our second stay at Ram’s house we were in Merced for work painting 2 High schools. The ac works awesome in the house, and the house has a lot of square footage for a family to not feel like they are crowded. Its such a beautiful house and it has everything you need. I would recommend this house to anyone staying in the area. Thanks Ram for letting us stay at your home it was such a pleasure we appreciate it."

Stayed with a pet","All I can say is wow, this house is absolutely gorgeous, it’s brand new. I was in Merced for work and it was so nice going home to this house after a long hot day in the sun. I really enjoyed my stay and I already have plans to go back to this house. You should definitely stay here if your in Merced you won’t be disappointed. The home owner is awesome, he gets back to you super quick. I would 1000% recommend staying at Rams house."
