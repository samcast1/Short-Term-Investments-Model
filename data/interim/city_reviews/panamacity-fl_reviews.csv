Stayed a few nights","This adorable little studio is so convenient to everything in Panama City. I could tell Elizabeth put in so much effort to make sure the space is safe, cozy and comfortable. It was truly my home away from home for 4 nights. I loved being able to do laundry. And everything was well stocked. The bed was firm, but that’s how I like it. And my favorite part, just a 5 minutes drive down Cherry street and you can sit on a bench and watch the sunset over St. Andrews Bay. If you’re staying in Panama City, this is a lovely spot to lay your head."

Things to note:
The shower is tiny. Ladies, shave before you visit.

The AC is a window unit - great if you sleep to white noise (we do), but might be a bit loud otherwise.
Thank you for a great stay!"

They really saved us on a trip where within 30 minutes of departure for driving 8 hours to close on a new house in the area, our original place to stay fell though. Jan to the rescue! When my husband and I got there, we both said it felt like home. The space is comfortable and when I say clean, I mean sparkly clean! If you forgot your shampoo or toothpaste, don’t worry, Jan’s got you covered. We just love the neighborhood and the proximity to lots of good restaurants. But most importantly, we consider Jan and Michael friends."

Stayed with a pet","Jan and Michael’s place is an absolute dream to stay in. Jan even noticed we were vegan in our bio and baked us a vegan cake to welcome us to our stay! There is so much attention to detail (aloe, electrolyte packets, a gift basket with doggie bags, board games, books, puzzles, I could go on and on!). They were so welcoming and kind and were so gracious with our dogs- who are very sweet, but have a tendency to “sing” from time to time, and even played fetch with them! They have dog toys for your pups in the yard, which is just a beautiful and serene space all on its own. It was such a cozy space that felt so homey and safe. I highly recommend staying with Jan and Michael, we would do so again without hesitation :)"

Stayed a few nights",I have way too many words for this review. From the moment My reservation was made she began her care. She she left treats for my dogs and me.. The space was supremely clean. It had literally everything you could think of that you may have forgotten at home. They played with my dogs they took me to the Bay. She took pictures and sent them to me and videos. Her Garden was an absolute dream. Jan and Mike are so sweet and accommodating at every turn. I enjoyed them so much I extended my stay 3 extra days. They are absolutely the most perfect hosts in the most perfect space and this was the most perfect space.

Everything was perfect just as it was described. The master bedroom which I booked was massive, very clean bath, shower and towels….supplies were more than sufficient. Definitely worth every penny. I absolutely recommend this. Good job Mr. Raymond."

bed and pillows were incredibly comfortable.. No both sides of the bed had charging ports for phones, etc. The washer and dryer was a wonderful amenity for a tiny home. The neighborhood is mixed with new builds and older homes. Parking is safe and secure. Was exactly what I was needing for my weekend checking out the springs in the area… Thank you! ."

It took about 15 minutes to get to St Andrews state park, which was beautiful! Nice to visit the ""touristy"" area then retreat back to the quiet. It felt comfortable and clean. Would stay again when we come back."

On my first stay, I asked for a small table in my room, and this stay, they had a nice desk with a lamp so I could read in my room. They really do listen and act on suggestions. The neighborhood has sidewalks, so it was nice to take a walk after it cooled down in such a nice and safe place. I very much would recommend this wonderful and peaceful place."

My hosts were so very nice and very accommodating, beyond what I expected from a host. It was nice to mingle a bit whit them, but it was clear, they new when to leave me to myself and gave me space to do my studies. How nice too, that my first stay with this company was with such wonderful hosts. Very highly recommend this place, the room and shared space is very nice and well equipped. Seriously, I didn't expect all that to be offered. You don't get that in a hotel."

If you’re looking for a place to stay while in PC, I’d recommend here instead of some average hotel! Plenty of privacy if that’s your thing, but great conversation, company and great nights having family dinners and sharing stories!

Stayed a few nights","Overall, this was a cozy cottage to relax in. However, there were a few hiccups. Upon arrival, I had to ask for the check in code instead of having it readily available beforehand. The house was fairly clean but I did come across some spider webs here and there. There was a nail sticking out in front of the bathroom from the floor boards, which I stepped on accidentally. The drains did not properly work leaving me to figure out how to wash dishes etc. Lastly, the air conditioner did not work leaving us to be extremely hot. However, There was a nice scenery to the house and I enjoyed that subscriptions were already available on the tv and how there was a mini back yard for us to relax in and the host had a fast response time."

Stayed one night","We only stayed one night, and we loved our time here. If you are worried about not having privacy, don't worry, there's total privacy. The front yard is absolutely stunning, and hopefully we get to see the yard in it's full glory during the summer when the flowers all bloom. The couple that owns this Airbnb were an absolute delight. They were kind and very friendly! The inside was spotless and clean as well. They put instructions everywhere which I really appreciated because I never had to ask how to work something! I would definitely stay here again."

Stayed a few nights",Looked like the pictures. Hosts live right next door but was quiet and very accommodating. The palm tree in the driveway and plants hanging over the walkway could use some pruning. It was a bit of a pain to walk from the driveway to the apartment with the plants in the way. It was raining during my stay and the plants wet my clothes every time I walked by. Overall it was a comfortable stay while I was in town for work. I would stay here again.

Stayed with kids",Ricky’s space was perfect for our little family of four. The kids (6 and 3) enjoyed bunking together and feeding the koi fish on the patio every morning. Very close to Hunt’s Oyster Bar (one of my favorites). Only a 20 min drive back across the bridge to Panama City Beach and St. Andrew’s Park where we spent the days on the beach. Without traffic it probably would have only been about a 12 min drive but it was the week of the Fourth so there were lots of people in town. Highly recommend!

Kitchen is well stocked and the bathroom has extras such as a hair dryer. Beds were comfortable and extra blankets and pillows are provided.

The place is quiet and clean. Good for a break after the trip.
It's a place that feels familiar, there are board games, personal things for the bathroom.
I liked the detail of getting up in the morning and being able to make a delicious coffee or tea. (there are some basic pantry things)
The garden is ideal for spending time thinking or reading a book
I would definitely go back to this spot.

The space is very spacious, clean, comfortable and has a 'home away from home' feel. Check in was easy--thank goodness because it was pouring rain.
Should I be back in the area, I would definitely book again in the future.

Ricky and Juliet were both very accommodating and Juliet gave us suggestions as to where to go in town; although the airbnb is attached to the house, we never felt bothered or that we didn't have privacy. The house is in a neighborhood about 15-20 minutes from the PCB beach, but there is a lovely small beach that is a five-minute walk from the house. We loved it and it was definitely worth the money!"

Stayed a few nights","Mark was a wonderful host and helped with all my questions in a timely manner! The tiny house was the cutest little place! And really… other than the sleeping area, the space was well used and not so tiny 😊
It’s about 20 minutes from the beach and all the hustle and bustle which we preferred, but for the people thinking they want to be closer, the drive is a very simple drive to get there.
We hope to be back soon!"

The airbnb its self was extremely spacious despite the fact that it was advised as a “tiny house”. There is several grocery stores and food places nearby. Me and my wife loved this place for a private weekend getaway. Neighborhood was very quiet and safe. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone.

It was decorated cute and modern with all the necessities. The snack basket was a sweet little surprise! They also gave us privacy during our stay. The location was good as well due to light traffic and a short distance to the beach. Would highly recommend if you're a couple wanting a romantic getaway.

The location was perfect. Just a quick drive to several grocery stores and an easy drive down to the coast. Panama City has so much to offer and it was an absolute blast to explore all that the emerald coast had to offer. I sincerely hope to be back again!!"

Lynn Haven is a short drive (20mins) from the beautiful beaches of PCB. We really enjoy St. Andrew State Park.
Our host also recommended the “Jet Ski Dolphin Tour”, which we were looking into. We got to see many dolphins and even saw 3 jumping out of the water. Then, we spent some time on shell island. This was definitely a highlight of our trip.
Thanks again for the pleasant accommodation. We will see you next time!

The elevated sleeping arrangement was cool but we also enjoyed sleeping on the pull-out couch, as we could watch TV. We also enjoyed the outdoor living space, it had us wishing we could live here ourselves. We used the BBQ on several occasions as well. Overall, an absolute must-visit on your list of tiny house Airbnb’s! We can’t wait to visit again. Thank you for being such amazing hosts! - Jesse & Rebecca"

Stayed a few nights","The tiny house is such a great place to stay! It's beautiful, very comfortable, well stocked and immaculately clean. I stayed five days and had absolutely everything I needed. Mark was very quick to respond to the couple of questions I had.
I loved sleeping in the loft! The bed and pillows are super comfy and I slept great. The ceiling of the loft is pretty low, so if you're tall, you may not be able to sit up straight on the bed. It's a very fun and cozy space!
There were lots of little touches that were so nice, like water and fresh ice in the fridge, snacks and coffee pods on the counter, really soft and fluffy towels. The outside seating area is also beautiful and comfortable.
I have nothing negative to say. I stay in Airbnb's frequently and the tiny house is one of the best ones I've ever stayed in. I hope to stay there again when I'm visiting family in the area. I loved it!"

This easily is the #1 stay on our list so far on our air bnb journeys! Close to everything including the bay of the bayou, the beach and several hiking trails. Very stylish and cozy with everything you need from soaps cleaning supplies and snacks! My favorite part was the shower and the gas fire pit pergola. My now husband also would like to add that he beat me at corn hole board the hosts provided 😂They also gave us a special gift for our wedding! Thank you again Mark and Tina we will be back sometime soon!"

This by far has to be the best place I stayed at, especially for what I paid.
The amenities at this location are unmatched for the price. And frankly, Tonya and Ken are some of the best Airbnb hosts I've ever had. Check-in instructions were extremely clear, the property itself was gorgeous, and the check-out instructions were refreshingly straightforward and simple.
Although I was traveling for work, whenever I was at the place it truly felt like I was on vacation!"

The only thing i wish I could’ve changed was the fact that we came here during the winter instead of summer :) the airbnb is exactly as listed and feels very private and safe. The space is beautiful and comfy. We loved the hot tub and used it almost every night— probably our favorite amenity! Hosts were responsive and helpful and made the stay very welcoming. It’s about 20 minutes away from the beach and anything you need is within a 15-minute radius. We recommend looking at the recommendations listed in their binder for some good local spots to hit. Will try to book again during summer!!

It was such a delight to meet them and they gave me the warmest of welcomes.
They’ve went above and beyond to make the guesthouse a magical experience. The design is nothing short of impressive and it’s integration with the pool and resort aesthetic, from colors , to textures, and patterns, they’ve put a lot of hard work and dedication to give guests like me an amazing experience.

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I had a great stay at Ivy Palms! We were in town for a short stay for a friend’s beach wedding and didn’t want to stay in a hotel. It never took us longer than 15-20 minutes to get to the beach!
The property and pool house were adorable, comfy, and inviting. I wish we would’ve been able to spend more time hanging out there. Also, there was the sweetest cat that hung out with us anytime we were poolside!
Only downside is the internet connection wasn’t great so we weren’t always able to connect the Roku tv (but that may have been user error).
Tonya has created a beautiful, convenient, and affordable experience!"

Stayed a few nights","I can't say enough great things about my stay here...Tonya and Ken designed and built a beautiful and tranquil backyard! A nature lovers utopia, lots of cute small lizards, frogs, birds, and 2 adorable cats!! The hot tub was a great way to soothe those aching muscles after a fun day of snorkeling and kayaking at St. Andrew's State Park, just a short 20 minute drive from this paradise! Every corner, nook and cranny of the backyard was meticulously thought out and harmonizes...a calm sanctuary. If you value a peaceful and quiet neighborhood, you'll feel like you're in heaven here!! Tonya and Ken are down to earth, friendly, fascinating and just great people!
The airbnb guest house was very clean, decorated so nicley and tropically, and had thoughtful extras like a toothbrush and makeup remover wipes!! Don't tell too many people about this gem...I would like to reserve it sometime soon again!!"

Stayed a few nights","I had a great stay at Tonya's pool house. Perfect location for my needs. Near a Publix and food options. Quiet, clean and cozy. The bed and bedding was very soft and nice. Huge bathroom and plenty of hot water. Kitchen was very efficient and I loved having the Keurig style coffee maker, I used it everyday. I did not use the pool or hot tub but they looked wonderful, I would use if I stayed again and had the time! Tonya had excellent communication and was very hospitable.
Just a couple of things to note: the smoke alarm does go off easily when cooking on the stove! Also, the WiFi is a bit spotty...but this is told ahead of time in the information on the booking.
I would definitely stay again! :)"

Stayed a few nights","A HUGE thank you to Mrs. Jan and Mr. Mike for making our stay the most wonderful relaxing first ever stay in an airBnB rental. We loved every minute we were there. We arrived very late and we didn’t quite know what to expect with it being our first time and all, but when we arrived we felt extremely comfortable and happy to have made it there after a long drawn out drive. We were welcomed with fresh delicious sopapilla cheesecake, a nice Florida souvenir gift basket, and some nice treats for our fur babies. The home was emaculate with thoughtful touches everywhere. I was in awe of everything!
The back yard is a nature lovers dream with plenty of gorgeous flowers and with birds and squirrels and occasional turtles. Our fur babies loved the back yard and we felt comfortable letting them roam around in it off the leash with it being fenced. I want to call this place a tropical oasis with the beach or bay within a block away and parks, restaurants, and more also nearby.
No hotel can compare to our stay here. We were so relaxed here. We highly recommend! We are thankful to have met Mrs. Jan and Mr. Mike and we are thankful to have found their rental when we did. We hope to come again one day.
A million “thank you’s” to Mrs. Jan and Mr. Mike for everything…"

We were in complete awe of everything feom the gorgeous guest house to the scrumptious citrus brownies that were devoured by all within the hour of our arrival. There were other snacks and drinks provided that made our stay so welcoming. We felt right at home and have already planned our next vacation with them. Even after speaking to them for only a little while, they left us a little something to take home for our fur babies that didn't make this trip. If it was possible I would rate Jan and Michael 10+ stars!! And their adorable fur babies were so sweet! Jan and Michael went above and beyond and we couldn't be happier 💗 See you all next year!!"

The house & grounds are absolutely beautiful! It is very clean & comfortable. Jan has every toiletry you could need, as well as snacks, water, coffee, etc. The location was an extra blessing, as it afforded us nearby areas to swim in the Bay area, when the main coastal beaches were closed due to red flag rip tide warnings (it stormed off and on the three days we were in the area). There were many other activities for us to do. We recommend St.Andrew’s State Park. We walked the beaches there (even in the rain); It was beautiful and very close by. We would definitely stay here again!"

It’s a wonderful little addition to their home, two very spacious bedrooms with comfortable queen beds, a large bathroom, living room, and small kitchen area including a fridge, keurig, sink, and microwave. Jan has everything you could possibly need for your trip/stay from chips for snacking to extra toiletries! There’s also beach chairs and beach towels to borrow if you need them! She also made homemade lemon pound cake with the lemons from her backyard which was amazing!!
Lastly their backyard is one of a kind! Her flowers and the plants are absolutely beautiful! She also has two cats, a doggo, and 12 turtles outside! My favorite part of our stay was sitting in the backyard listening to the birds sing and reading my book. We can’t wait to come back!"

We enjoyed our time at her home and in her beautiful yard so much we found it hard to want to go out. Our dogs enjoyed it to. They even had a family dog, a golden retriever named Danny, come over for a play date with our Dutch Shepherd.

There was a lot of small touches that had a huge impact on us, the board games, the small things in the bathroom, the frozen mugs, I enjoyed reading through the notepad of other peoples stays.

The location is also amazing— the beautiful bay is down the street and PCB is about 15 minutes away! Hurricane damage is still very apparent in the area, but Jan & Michael’s place is pristine. This place is a GREAT VALUE!!! Please do not pass this bnb up, the hosts are wonderful."

Stayed a few nights",AMAZING!! This place is from top to bottom GORGEOUS! Mrs. Jan and her husband are incredible people! They make sure that everything goes well for your vacation. If you wake early enough you can see her beautiful turtles! The location is only 15-20 mins from the beach side of PCB! It’s a quiet and friendly neighborhood to stay at. Her backyard is truly magical and she has the cutest animals! It felt like I was truly at home for the days I spent with her! 11/10!! Let’s not forget her OUTSTANDING baking skills! She made me sticky buns for my birthday! I can’t wait to come back and see them again next year! Enjoy your time!! :)

Stayed a few nights","Jan's place was absolutely WONDERFUL! We booked this last minute for 4th of July and WHAT A VALUE! I feel like this place is a steal! They have a beautiful back yard with so many plants, birds, squirrels, fruits and spices to investigate. Its just such a relaxing space. Inside is just as interesting with all kinds of personal touches of family art and keepsakes! Just makes you feel right at home. This house is only a BLOCK from the Bay! Very Convenient for kayakers, or anyone looking to play in the bay water. Jan and her husband were so friendly and down to earth. And man can they cook! If you are lucky enough to try some of the Homemade queso dip or Sopapilla Cheesecake TRY IT! You won't regret it. The house has the ability for lots of interaction with the host or it has a private entrance and detachment from the house so you can keep to yourself and private the whole time if you wish (but they are pretty cool people to socialise with, with lots of great local info and stories). Its in a quite, peaceful, safe nighborbhood. The surrounding town areas does still have a lot of damage from the hurricane, but obviously there is nothing they can do about that, just dont be alarmed. They have worked hard to keep their property well maintained, and we were so glad to have found this GEM! We will DEFINITELY be back!"

Stayed a few nights","This place is a gem in the heart of downtown Panama City. It's convenient to everything -coffee shops, bagel place, a few bars, restaurants, etc. The place is two bedrooms that offers a lot of space. It's nicely furnished, super clean, and the front patio is a nice added bonus. When we had questions, Channon was quick to respond. Will definitely look to see if this place is available on future trips to the area."

Stayed about a week","This was a clean and comfortable place to stay! A couple minor issues with the WiFi going out and the battery on the door lock keyless entry died and needed replaced. But both issues were resolved. There’s a few dogs in the area that barked in the mornings but not constantly. We had no issues with noisy neighbors and enjoyed a relaxed environment. The bed was comfy. Plenty pillows & blankets. Coffee, sugar and other kitchen items available. If you have joint issues the spiral stairs could present a problem. I just took my time and was extra cautious. We would definitely stay again."

Stayed over a week","Blake was an excellent host. He was available and always gave reminders about trash day (which if you’re like me, you need the reminders lol). I stayed here for one month. The house was beautiful and exactly as described. The parking was private and easily accessible. The kitchen was perfect and the back porch off the living area was a great space to hang out. 10/10 recommend."

Situated just minutes away from the vibrant city of Panama City Beach, Lynn Haven provides easy access to world-class beaches, shopping, dining, and entertainment options. Yet, despite its proximity to bustling tourist attractions, Lynn Haven maintains a tranquil atmosphere, making it an ideal retreat for those seeking a peaceful getaway. Will visit Again !!"

Everything was just like the pictures and location was great, close enough to drive to the beach but far enough to avoid the beach traffic. The neighbors and nearby houses were not a problem at all! Me and my partner loved the design of the house, especially the spiral staircase and unique bed frame! We will definitely book again!"

Beware if the spiral staircase. My friend who was staying with me fell down the side hole on the 2 floor. They’re ok and its a good memory. Other than that it was a pleasant stay"

Stayed over a week","Palm Paradise was a true oasis for a relaxing and entertaining two week vacation. This two level (The spiral staircase will keep you in shape if you don't have time to workout in the garage) vacation rental sits behind it in a rather private setting in a residential neighborhood. Robust amenities and a first rate internet exist for one's needs and comforts while vacationing on the FL Panhandle. Access to groceries, retail shopping, and restaurants is minutes away. Blake and his team are fabulous communicators and responsive when you reach out. Its value cannot be overlooked for its location although it is a ways to the beaches. But sitting in north Lynn Haven one can access them as readily by actually going north on Hwy 77, then west past the airport and turning back south on Hwy 79 through West Bay to Panama City Beach. I found this far less traffic stressful, as quick, and far more scenic as it launches you onto all that Florida's Emerald Coast has to offer. Check it out!!"

Blake was awesome and tried to accommodate with another unit he had available, but unfortunately the other unit was not nearly as nice nor big enough. We stayed one night all together out of the 3 we had reserved. Wish we could’ve stayed there the entire time, this guest house is so cute & homey! Just had an unlucky stay. I would still recommend to stay here! Love the stairs."

Stayed with kids","Cute and quaint place. Perfect for a small family quick stay. Good location without all the noise of the beach but within decent distance.
Negatives…no light in the shower, the sofa bed mattress is thin and uncomfortable and I ended up staying on an air mattress instead. Also, the neighbors smoke as well as have 3 dogs and outside smells like poop and cigarettes. you can also hear the dogs growling or fighting at night.
Overall it’s good for the price and I would stay there again. Hosts are extremely responsive and helpful and would rent from them anytime."
