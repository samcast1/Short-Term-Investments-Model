Stayed one night",Beautiful place right in front of the beach. Beach access is a 2-3min walk from the front door. Neighborhood felt safe. Host was responsive and very kind and helpful. Allowed us to drop off our luggage early and provided a full list of things to-do without us even asking. House is beautiful and super spacious. Already looking forward to staying here again!

Beautiful path along the coast, and easy walk to anything you might need. Most importantly, Al is wonderful. We hope to return again and again."

Stayed a few nights","Al’s home is the quintessential beachfront getaway. It is a wonderful quiet escape that truly has everything one needs to get the full pacific coast experience. I couldn’t have been happier with the accommodations. You immediately feel as if you are home. The kitchen is pristine and the house is filled with activities to enjoy even if the rain makes its way in. Once the rain clears, your master bedroom and living space is filled with a picturesque ocean backdrop that is literally a stones throw away. A quiet hidden gem that I would recommend to all. I very much see myself returning as soon as I can. Al is an incredible host and gives tremendous recommendations to ensure you get the most out of your stay."

Stayed a few nights","Wonderful cozy and romantic place for a couple and is big enough for a family with kids. Beautiful and modern interior, relaxing outdoor lounging areas front and backyard. Lovely sunroom at front of house if it’s too cool outside, with great views of the ocean steps away.
One of the best stays we’ve ever had. We followed Al’s recommendations for restaurants and we ate very well as a result. Many options for games and a super comfy couch for chilling in the evening with a movie. We absolutely loved that they had a few conversation topic books and games there if you want to have nice romantic conversations with your partner. Best thing, super close to the East Bay for a quick and easy getaway when you need one. Highly recommend Al’s place, you won’t regret it."

Stayed a few nights","Was visiting my son in SF and decided to get out of town for a couple days and enjoy some time by the ocean. This place was perfect for us! Hard to choose a room between the view of the ocean and the beautiful, private garden in back. We loved having a firepit both in front and in the backyard. We enjoyed playing bocce under the stunning cypress, as well as some of the other games. We weren't there long enough to cook, but the kitchen was nice and open! We were able to walk to the grocery and nearby restaurants, but our view in the neighborhood was the quiet street, ocean, and the peaceful garden in back.
Al and his wife went above and beyond even having 2 pieces of cake from a local bakery delivered to our door for my birthday!"

Stayed with kids","This is a really cute ocean view cottage on a quiet street and nice location. The backyard is fenced and has great landscaping, perfect for kids and families. The front yard has nice chairs and a firepit, and is peaceful to sit and look out at the ocean. The cottage has a nice enclosed front porch, which was great so sit out in and a game room in the back that had fun things to do, such as a video arcade style game and board games. The kitchen is nicely updated and the three bedrooms were very comfortable, with plenty of linens and pillows to use. We were there on a colder rainy weekend and the house was cozy and warm. The Host Al was very welcoming and proactively sent us local reommendations that included nearby grocery and restaurants. I especially appreciated this, as we immediately needed provisions after arriving and knew where to go. Al was super sweet and shared a thoughtful birthday treat with us, helping make our stay memorable. The SF Zoo is nearby and we enjoyed visiting."

Stayed with kids","We had the most delightful stay at this charming beach house in Pacifica! From the moment we arrived, our host, Al, went above and beyond to ensure that our experience was nothing short of perfect. The attention to detail and hospitality provided truly made our trip memorable.The house itself was not only beautiful but impeccably clean, making it easy to settle in and feel right at home. One of the highlights was definitely the gorgeous backyard, adorned with vibrant flowers and a fire pit. My 3-year-old nephew had an absolute blast playing there, especially with the PacMan machine and the selection of classic kids' board games like Operation and Candyland. The bunk beds were also a hit, adding an extra element of fun to his stay. Walking along the ocean just a stone's throw away was a serene experience, and the ocean views from both the living room and bedrooms were spectacular. It was the perfect Spring Break, and my husband, nephew, and I could not have been happier. Thanks, Al!"

Stayed with kids",Amazing little house with spectacular views of the ocean. The decor and vibe of the home is just fantastic - so many amazing details. The house felt cozy and welcoming with huge windows with ocean views from multiple rooms and a super cute backyard area. Was also very conveniently located as we had an early morning flight out of SFO and it took us less than 15 mins to get there. Host was very responsive and helpful. We were honestly sad that we only had one night to spend here - would highly recommend for anyone looking for a nice Oceanside spot with convenient location to SF and the beach/coastline.

Stayed with kids","The perfect getaway for our little family! Highly recommended. The view is wonderful and proximity to beaches and beautiful hikes can’t be beat. Host sent a very helpful list of local attractions. Beds were super comfy and every bedroom had blackout curtains (perfect for naptime). Plenty of games and activities for everyone and the fire pits in the front a back yard are so nice to have. Coffee and creamer selection were limited, but not a deal-breaker. Host offered to replenish k-pods if needed. Check in and check out were simple and smooth. Definitely on our list to return!"

We loved the views. The firepit in the front yard was great. The beds were super comfy. Al gave us tons of recommendations for local spots. The house rules were clear and easy to follow.

Stayed with kids","I was in the Bay Area to visit friends and decided on the house in Pacifica as a meeting point and a getaway for me and a close friend, her husband and their 5 month old. And, well, WOW. The house was perfect in every way. Location is perfect. Decor is perfect. View of the Pacific, perfect. The backyard with the lilies and fire pit, perfect. I could go on. I highly recommend this place and we hope to be back soon. Also, the hosts were super responsive when my brain broke and I couldn't figure out how to start the fire pit (and that was on a Friday night!)"

Everything was impeccable from the host’s communication and friendliness, to the place being so beautifully done, spacious and CLEAN! A bonus for us was the insane storm that passed through Nor Cal while we were at Al’s and being able to watch that unfold from this house was quite an experience. Highly recommend to anyone looking to rent it. Thank you for the escape, Al. We are so coming back!"

We really enjoyed the ring toss on the wall and mini pool table. Other than that, lots of cute restaurants that are walkable from the house, and we really recommend this place to anyone looking for a little ocean retreat. Thanks again, Al!"

Highly recommend to anyone who wants to feel right at home and not stress one bit about what to do since there's plenty of opportunities to shut down, decompress and let your brain enjoy the amenities.
Can't wait for you guys to experience the great time we experienced! Dual firepits... yup! Pac-Man... yup! But unfortunately you guys won't be able to enjoy any of this because I've officially moved in. 😂❤️"

1. Left the windows open just prior to our arrival to allow the fresh ocean air to fill the home. Great first impression
2. Chocolates and personalized written greeting upon our arrival. Made the kids super happy after a long car ride

The backyard is as stunning as the oceanfront yard! For being in a charming, quiet neighborhood, it's still close enough to walk to restaurants, down to Esplanade beach and along the ocean. Didn't have to drive anywhere until our last day driving to Mori Point for a final hike which was outstanding.

Stayed a few nights","In summary, everything related to Al can be described as perfect: hosting, proposals, responsiveness and proactivity. So, as we were staying 4 joirs and then quickly indicated our wish to have good espresso coffee, Al had us deliver the next day from the Lavazza pods by Amazon! And the day before we left, we discovered some good pastries when returning home, the latter, in a very peaceful place was as described (no air conditioning not a challenge; vigilance on the lack of a washing machine for stays of several days) and Pacifica is a 30-minute drive from all the centers of SF interest.
And then there is what does not depend on Al and can be imperfect, like the microclimate on the edge of the Pacific, with a very frequent fog and fog while the weather is clear in San Francisco.
In the end, a very good memory."

Stayed a few nights","This is what you hope for from an AirBnB but so rarely get: a beautiful location, lovely home, helpful host, and thoughtful amenities.
I wanted to find a beach place in the bay area on short notice. I was lucky Al's was available for two nights. I traveled there with my 20-year-old daughter from Colorado and we were joined one evening by my older daughter and her boyfriend who drove up from Mountain View. The twentysomethings loved the mix of boho and midcentury decor and I loved the gorgeous all-white kitchen. We made s'mores around the backyard firepit, watched a movie on the high-end tv, and fixed ourselves brunch in the well-equipped kitchen. A three-mile walk along the coastline together was a highlight.
We slept well in the comfortable beds cooled by the ocean breeze, so welcome after our overheated Colorado summer.
This was a brief but much-needed chance to set our cares down and connect with each other. Thank you Al and Nat for hosting us in your lovely oceanfront home."

Stayed a few nights","We stayed in Pacifica during late July/early August during which the weather was quite cold and foggy. While we knew this was typical for this time of year in the Bay area, it made our stay less enjoyable. Fortunately, the house has a great forced-air heating system which we needed to use almost every day. Also, having to share one bathroom and shower with my wife and teenage daughter, while manageable, created some stress and clutter. The lack of a washing machine and dryer in the house also made things somewhat problematic during our 4-day stay. Both of these potential issues are made very clear in the Listing of Amenities. Nevertheless, I would recommend thinking about these issues especially if 4-6 people will be staying in the house."

The back yard is beautiful, and they have put a lot of work into updating this home. They took extra time to provide treats for us (thank you!), and really went the extra mile to help us feel welcome. We slept really well and the beds were comfortable. I also really loved that they had a filtered water pitcher in the fridge, and that they took the time to send us local food recommendations. Couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay!"

We were pleasantly surprised by a delivery of amazing treats for our sons birthday-they were quite amazing, coming fresh from their favorite local bakery.

+ When the windows were open and the ocean breeze through the house was just right.
+ The location is perfect. Watch the sunset from the front of the house, or just to get down to the beach by crossing the street.
+ The sunset is a HUGE selling point. It met my expectations as a treat for my wife and baby.
+ The shops and restaurants within walking distance, made us feel so welcome, and we met so many local people who were just charming.
+ The central location between Santa Cruz and San Francisco was awesome. Less than 15-20 minutes away from adventure.
10/10 I wish this was my home. We would love to visit here again in the future."

The house is beautiful and wonderfully decorated. The situation is ideal: right by the ocean, 4 minutes walk to grocery stores, bakery and restaurants. Very calm (the only noise being the waves 🌊).
We loved the walk down to the beach and even saw whales, dolphins and a sea-lion swimming by.
We weren’t very lucky with the weather, but nevertheless we enjoyed the view whenever the sky would clear up. And because it was pretty cloudy and cold, we even more enjoyed staying inside the house, the good heating system, the cosy living room, the many games in the dining room… it was perfect!
We slept really well. 5 stars house with great availability from Al. Sweet little attentions upon arrival and at departure.
We would stay at Al’s place anytime again! We already miss it!"

I am SO happy for the change in weather as this home is now on my list for a return stay! Not only does it have breathtaking panoramic views of the Pacific Ocean, it is decorated perfectly and soooo clean.
As a super host myself, I have to say this property is absolutely 5 stars. You will feel at home as soon as you enter. Sit outside and enjoy the fire pit, do yoga in the beautiful back yard as I did, and play one of the various games available on site.
If you are seeking a place to reset, recharge, and enjoy spectacular ocean views, this is THE place.

Stayed a few nights","Al and Nat's place in Pacifica was a perfect oasis from which to celebrate a family holiday. We could see the ocean's expanse from almost every room, and could go to sleep hearing the pounding surf. I am from Northern California, but live out of the country now, so coming back to such a comforting place right across a very quiet road from the ocean was a balm to the soul.
Their place is immaculate, with lots of fun added touches. My son and daughter (in their 20s), husband and I had such playing foosball indoors and cornhole out in the spacious, groomed backyard after a morning of surfing. The kitchen was well supplied and the coffee maker already had what we needed to start the day.
Even when we needed an HDMI cord to connect our laptop to the TV, Al had someone leave it on our front porch within minutes!
Thank you for a wonderful, gracious and communicative stay!"

Not only that but I love how Al was willing to accommodate almost every one of our requests. They even went the extra mile providing us with a cute welcome letter, chocolates, and slippers for our guests.
I also loved how each area and room gave a totally different vibe from the front enclosed porch to the back arcade room. The weekend we visited we got rained in and still managed to have a great time. The attention to detail and all the beautiful messages in the home gave such a special touch to the house and really set the tone for our trip, including the neon sign in the front, made it very easy to find our home in case we went on a walk (just follow the yellow light lol).
Al, we just want to say thank you so much for accommodating us! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

We were able to explore with our two small children without any worries. The decor was modern and house was filled with tons of entertainment. Al was the perfect host. He accommodated our many requests and even gave two unexpected gifts. The laundry mat was open late, only 1 block away, and very clean. I highly recommend people to book this house for their trip to the Bay Area."

Stayed a few nights","If you’re looking for the ultimate home away from home when visiting the San Francisco area then look no further than the Oceanfront Boho Retreat in Pacifica, California. Nestled in a quiet neighborhood only steps from the ocean. Sit and listen to the waves while enjoying the stunning sunsets. We felt at home from the moment we walked into Al’s retreat. A handwritten note along with a welcome gift was waiting for us the day we arrived. Along with a box of delicious bakery treats which were delivered the last evening of our stay. Al is the most attentive host we’ve had the pleasure to rent from. Excellent communication as well as detail oriented. He gave us so many wonderful ideas of places to visit both in and around the Pacifica area. We will definitely rent this lovely home again the next time we’re in the area. Thank you Al!!"

Stayed a few nights","One of the reasons we often choose AirBnBs over hotels is the unique character that rentals offer. This bungalow did not disappoint. The house was absolutely beautiful from the outside in- great little sitting areas with fire pits, a beautiful, large back yard, cozy places to chill and relax, airy layout, and everything you need to enjoy a stress free vacation by the ocean was included with this house.
The inside is beautifully decorated with plenty of towels, blankets, and pillows. The kitchen is large and well-stocked, and the little game room was so fun to chill and play in. The living room, sun porch, and master bedroom all have beautiful ocean views, and the house was immaculate.
What set this rental apart for us was the attention and care that the owners have put into making your stay perfect. We arrived to a handwritten note welcoming us to the party along with chocolates, the kuerig rack was stocked with coffee, and the owners gave us a wonderful list of local shops and restaurants to try during our stay- and the ones we tried were all fantastic. You can tell how much love they’ve put into this property. We can’t wait to come back!"

The beds were very comfortable, there was an abundance of pillow options, and the owners included so many thoughtful touches throughout the house: cozy sitting areas, fun games for couples / families, full TV options to help unwind. Would absolutely return for a visit and will strongly recommend!"

Stayed with kids","First of all I would like to say the host was a spectacular host. Al communicated very nicely, answered all our questions, sent us a “Things to do/near by Guide” highlighting restaurants near by & beaches close by. The host also had disposable slippers at the door for us, a box of treats & a beach toy for our kids. This was so thoughtful & sweet. Al was quick to respond & very attentive.
Secondly, the location of this Airbnb is fabulous as it is located centrally to many eateries, close to grocery shopping & many beaches. The dining room, Kitchen, Living room & Sun room all offer Million dollar Ocean views !!!! Walking Access to the beach was also possible from this Airbnb.
Check in was super easy with a self check in key pad. Parking was not an issue what so ever. The neighbors were all very friendly. Dominos delivers pizza to the home if you’re in the mood to stay in & craving pizza.
Now the space itself:
The decor is super cute with geometric themes. The beds were super comfortable & the bedding was soft. The host provides ample towels, Shampoo, Conditioner & Body wash. The Kitchen is well stocked with Olive oil, Salt, Pepper, Pots/Pans, Plating, Soy sauce. A kerug is avail for coffee. Tea is also avail if you are not a fan of coffee.
Al’s home offers a Firepit/ Game area/ Big Backyard/ is Updated & those fabulous ocean views for a fantastic stay.
We loved our stay here & would highly recommend it. We hope to be back again soon !!!!"

There were some heavy winds and an overnight storm but we had the nice sunroom to retreat to. We even saw whales at sunset while relaxing on the patio! What a thrill! There were paragliders and seabirds to watch and such beautiful sunsets. Al was a great host and easily contacted us immediately when needed. Off street parking and lovely backyard were bonuses. The neighborhood is quiet with a grocery in walking distance, as well as nearby restaurants and walking paths. Downtown San Francisco was just a quick drive and it was so nice to come “home” at the end of a busy day to this idyllic oasis. The place was spotless and had plenty of space for a family. The views of the ocean were wonderful but so was the beautiful garden. We fully intend to come back when visiting the area."

Stayed with kids","This place was an absolute dream. We took my 4 year old daughter and 1 year old son. I was not sure how they were going to sleep in a new place, and not only did they sleep, they both slept in. My daughter absolutely loved the bunk bed, and she said the bed was very comfortable. The master bed was extremely comfortable as well, and the view from the master was amazing. The house was decorated so nice, and the games both inside and outside were fabulous. Unfortunately the weather did not cooperate with us while we were there, so we spend most of the vacation stuck inside. This would normally not be ideal, but because the house had everything we needed, and it was so cozy, we did not mind. The sunroom was everyone’s favorite. We loved watching the ocean and the sunset from this room. This is definitely the best place we’ve stayed at as a family, and my daughter is already asking when we can come back."

I researched (and I mean researched) all of our Air BnBs before committing and this one did not disappoint! The town was under gale wind warnings which kept us inside for the day but that didn't ruin the breathtaking sunset. Fantastic views. Fantastic hosts. Fantastic amenities- everything was exactly as pictured! We appreciated the extra care Al and his wife gave to us (a fresh apple pie showed up on our doorstep- a special treat for the less than ideal weather!) wow right?! We traveled with 2 adults and two 12 yr olds (2 other adult family members local to the area joined us for a visa it and there was plenty of space)! Thanks, Al!"

Room 9 is a little tight but worked for the two of us. The Room 11 was absolutely wonderful. Everything was so neat and clean. Parking is a little tricky in tight spot garages within the courtyard, but doable. Just need to be careful. We ended up leaving our rental car in the garage and rode the buses everywhere. Felt safe to leave the car there and not have to worry about parking anywhere. The staff was so friendly and helpful on directions and things to do in the nearby areas. Even gave us a tour of the plants in the courtyard as time permitted. We obviously were quite pleased and would recommend this place."

Stayed one night","I’m giving this Airbnb a 4/5, solely due to poor communication when it came to parking. The location is great, the room is clean, and the boutique is quiet. I would stay here again.
only problem was I got this Airbnb b/c it stated it comes w/ garage parking. Honestly, everything 5 stars up until they called me at 11PM, while I was out with friends, asking me to move my vehicle within the next 10 minutes b/c it belonged to a resident. I was out w/ my friends & wasn’t going to get up, walk blocks in heels to move my car due to poor communication.
Upon check in, she had let me know that I can park in any garage that is open & empty. What she didn’t state was that I can only park in the inside garages, not the ones outside.
Anyways, they called my phone about 3 times b/c I wasn’t there within 10 minutes. Finally, I get an Uber to move my car & the host tells me I can actually leave it there lol. Literally wasted my time.
Just be aware of this or you’ll need to park on the street."

Stayed a few nights","The motel was beautiful! I appreciated the included parking, as we had a rental car. I loved all the flowers (we came in April and it was the perfect time for blooms) on the property, it felt a little like a mini Tuscany. I was a bit worried about street traffic but we were situated toward the back of the property and it wasn't bad at all, especially with some white noise played off my phone while we were sleeping. We'd stay here again."

Stayed one night","I had to find a very last minute place to stay for the night as my previous Air BnB was absolutely disgusting.
I found this place and was ABSOLUTELY FLOORED how amazing this place is. I loved everything about it!! It was SO clean, well maintained and it just felt like home.
Adored how they kept the character of the building from the outside right to the inside.
Location honestly couldn’t be better and it was so worth it being able to park your car in a garage-type unit.
Next time I’m in SAN Fran I am 100% coming back here. Worth every penny!
***Do be aware; if you are a light sleeper be careful because you can hear the traffic throughout the night. Not a big deal but just an FYI for those that would apply to :)"

Loved the vibe of the hotel, lots of plants and flowers and the locking garage access for your car was great. The street itself outside of the hotel was a little rough, but that’s not their fault, just something to be aware of. Chestnut street (one block over) has a ton of bars and restaurants to hang out at. WiFi was not great - but hey, you’re not in SF to hang out in the hotel."

Room is nice and mostly up to date. Free parking is a plus. Wish they did their lock system different (combination codes for example) but overall it felt safe enough to not even need to close the door. Would stay again.

It was a very small room with no table or seating, so it was very difficult to conduct work there. The room itself was quite dated looking. I was also woken up to very loud construction being conducted right outside my window at around 8-9 AM. The price I paid was really hotel prices— there seem to be much nicer hotels and AirBnbs available at that range. The staff was very nice and helpful though!"

Make sure your room is in the courtyard as couple are on Lombard and that is not a desirable location due to noise and the bums."

Having stayed at other local motels and bnbs, I'd say Marina is the best for the cost."

Accommodating and very kind reception by the front desk. It’s got lots of plants outside that give it this lovely warm look, such a treat specially in the morning when I walked out and it all felt and sounded fresh.

And the location near the Marina and with all the fun places to shop and eat on Chestnut Street were amazing.

Stayed a few nights","I loved this place! The hotel grounds are charming and well cared for, with small, lovely touches throughout. There's something personal about the Marina Inn -- a feeling that you're not just stepping into the room of a hotel chain but into someone's home. There were a lot of contradictions in the rules advertised on Airbnb and the ones received after purchase so I had to call to make sure what to expect. The rules advertised were more restrictive than actual rules. For example, the Airbnb listing said check in time is from 4-6pm but the front office is actually open until 10pm and you can call to make special arrangements if checking in past 10pm. They offer individual parking garages on a first come, first serve basis but, if no garages are available, they will direct you to parking spots in their courtyard. Great location! Near lots of restaurants, Chrissy Field, Palace of Fine Arts, and many more. Would highly recommend! A+++"

Stayed one night","The pluses: If you have a vehicle, this is a great location - having a garage for your car is a luxury in SF! The room was quaint and the courtyard is nice. The bathroom was spotless.
The minuses: Although the hotel is near the Cow Hollow neighborhood, which is nice, the walk to that area from the hotel is via a motel-lined busy and not very walkable street. The noise insulation between the garages and the rooms is not great so I was woken up several times in the middle of the night by the car pulling in and out of the garage below the room and the sound echoing into the room."

The front desk gave us a small space heater which helped, but this was different from what was advertised. It was a small space, mold in the coffee maker, and parking is very tight! I wouldn’t say this was a bad place to be, but I don’t know if I would have signed up to pay as much as I did for a place this outdated."

Stayed a few nights","When I found the Marina Motel, I was in the final days of a road trip. I had just walked across the Golden Gate Bridge and was looking for an easy place to stay in the city. I was drawn to how guests have private, single-car garages below their rooms. The motel is also located in the Marina District, which is minutes from the bridge and near places like Crissy Fields and the Presidio. That meant I was safe to leave my car and explore on foot. What I didn't know, though, was that when I arrived at the motel I would feel transported to a place closer resembling Europe. The walls are painted with murals and large plants grow in the courtyard. The motel has been family-run since the 1930's and the staff had that level of care for the space and its guests. My studio space was comfortable and the tiled, walk-in shower was a nice touch — all for an affordable price. I look forward to staying here again."

Stayed about a week","This place is clean, safe, and well-connected with buses into the city as close as a couple of blocks away. The host, Emily, was responsive and flexible, and quick to provide solutions for any minor issues that came up.
Location-wise, it's great if you are looking for a place to stay outside of the hustle and bustle of the city without being too far off the grid. It's across the street from Golden Gate Park and walking distance to coffee shops and the beach, so there is enough nearby to keep you busy during the day.
The only thing to note is that the window looks out to a light well, so it can be fairly dark, but that shouldn't be an issue if you just need a safe and comfortable place to stay while exploring the city.
Overall, I would recommend this place to others and would stay here again."

I did not use it but it was good to have. There’s 2 lines of bus around Emily’s place - line 5 and line 38. And the Golden Gate Park is very close too.
Emily is a really good host! She helped me keep my luggage since the check out is quite early and I had some time to kill before leaving for the airport. Overall, recommended for short stay!"

The room it’s even more big that how it looks in the pictures. Everything was clean. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was perfect. Emily was a great host. She answered me very quick and she had the generosity of receiving some packages. She also stored my luggage for a few hours after the check out and let me take one final visit to the city.

Stayed about a week","Emily’s airbnb was extremely clean and inviting - perfect for a solo traveler. The unit is in a beautiful area of the Richmond right next to Golden Gate Park. Location is also great for its proximity to the 5 MUNI bus. One downside - the place is not the most convenient for getting around to restaurants / groceries in the neighborhood (15 min walk minimum to most things). Additionally, the walls in the unit are quite thin - you can very clearly hear conversations of the guests in the other unit. This wasn’t the biggest issue for me, but definitely doesn’t promote the most privacy nor is it great for light sleepers. All that said, given the proximity to transport and the park - plus the price point - I would be happy to stay here again!"

Only downside is the walls are very thin so you can easily hear the conversation of guests in the other room if you’re home at the same time. Emily provided helpful instructions for checkin during the stay.

Stayed a few nights","Situated nearby Golden Gate Park, the house is in a quiet neighborhood, conveniently located near a bus stop and a short walk to restaurants. The room would be a good fit for a solo traveler without too many belongings. For those who want to explore the west side of San Francisco, this would be a good place to stay. As a host, Emily was responsive and friendly. On the night prior to my departure, I ran into her outside of the house and got to chat with her about San Francisco, her family, the neighborhood, and many other things. We talked like old friends for an hour. She's a great person to talk to and made me feel very welcomed. I had a pleasant stay overall."

Stayed a few nights","The unit is as described and affordable. Emily was responsive and courteous.
As other reviews and Emily’s own description point out, the walls are extremely thin. I didn’t have an issue with the noise itself as much as the lack of privacy. I could very clearly hear every word spoken by guests in the unit next door, which meant they could also easily hear me. The lack of privacy made staying in the unit less comfortable than I preferred.
The cleaning fee being more than the cost of the unit itself was a bit frustrating, as it ended up doubling the cost. The unit is so small that a $75 per night cleaning fee seems exorbitant."

Stayed a few nights","Emily was easy to work with, very responsive, and helpful. She even loaned me a yoga mat for my stay and allowed me to check in early according to my flight plans. The place is as described. A small studio with a bathroom and kitchenette. There is also a helpful hanging rack for clothes, a space heater, a mini fridge, and a kettle. no coffee maker - bring instant coffee/ French press. the walls are indeed very thin and sound travels, there are earplugs provided. I usually fall asleep watching a movie or a show and was able to just wear my standard headphones without any problems. There is a window in the space, it opens to the hallway of the building- which does let in some natural light but isn't super private as the hallway is a shared space. The location is great. about half an hour's walk to the Japanese Tea Garden/ California Academy of Sciences, half a block to Golden Gate Park, 10 min walk to great restaurants/mini marts/coffee shops on Balboa Street.
Would stay again :)"

It was a secure and beautiful place to come back to after every busy day. There were earplugs there, but I found it to be pretty quiet and I didn't use them. For those wondering about hills (it's San Francisco, after all!), the house is on a hill, but there is a long, mainly flat, city-crossing street nearby. You can minimize hills if you start there and use GPS to get around. Emily herself is quite friendly and responded to questions quickly."

Stayed a few nights","The unit was not as advertised... it was better; the pictures do not do it justice. Needed a place to stay and mostly sleep while my home was being painted and this was exactly what I needed. Reminded me of a hotel room, basic amenities for a short stay, private, and mostly quiet. I am a light sleeper and could hear the bass of the TV upstairs through the ceiling, but they provided earplugs to workaround that. The neighborhood is quiet and very safe (felt comfortable leaving things in my car); located next to Golden Gate Park which was a fun switch up from my usual home in mid-city. OB is close for the beach lovers, and plenty of great restaurants a short distance away. Would stay again and would reco for any needing some basic accommodations in a quiet neighborhood."

Highly recommend for solo travelers who want to avoid tourist-packed hotels in the noisy and smelly Downtown SF. Emily's place is a studio room in a quiet family neighborhood. There is a very clean mini kitchen and a small work desk. (I can hear the fridge and the room next door every night, but it is understandable for any house.) I also recommend walking to Richmond District and discover some hidden gem restaurants. They are as excellent as those in Mission District/Chinatown."

I was able to drop my bags off early before check-in and the hosts were kind enough to put my bags in the room before I checked-in that evening.
The guests next door were quite loud throughout my stay, which was unfortunate, but Emily was very communicative and helpful. They also provided earplugs in the room, which I appreciated.

Stayed a few nights","Emily's listing points out that she provides earplugs because guests will hear sounds from their home above. You will really need them because there is no sound insulation in the ceiling of the guest quarters. You can almost hear every word of conversation and their TV is particularly shrill. This is very different from the normal sounds of an apartment above, as I had been hoping. Wearing earplugs is not ideal day after day.
The room is small but adequate for one. It has only a refrigerator and microwave and minimal dishes and cutlery. The bed is comfortable and the bathroom is new and very clean. Very nice shower. Convenient to the MUNI buses on Fulton and there are great restaurants on Geary and Clement streets within walking distance."

It's not a very touristy area and I liked getting to explore the Outer (and Inner) Richmond neighborhoods. The bed is comfy, the space is small but had everything I needed.

The room is clean, warm, and decorated very simply. It has everything you need to enjoy your stay.
Check-in and out is very easy and Emily is responsive to any questions you may have about the room."

I found it hard to properly relax in the room due to noise from the room next door, above and the garage being louder than I'd expected. There's also limited natural light. However the space is a clean and a practical base for short-terms stays. Emily kept me stocked in fruit and was prompt dealing with my concerns."

The garage they suggest is closed, but it is more expensive and is three blocks away."

The phenomenal bathroom, the shower goes great. They put a small breakfast (croisanes and other sweets, fruit, coffees and teas) enough not to go out with an empty stomach. The only downside is that it faces the street and it's very noisy, the rooms were not well isolated and you can hear everything from the rooms next door too. Nothing that some earplugs can't solve. The location is great, in the middle of downtown. In short, very good value for money. I would definitely come back"

Stayed a few nights","I was really excited to stay here, and fully believe it could one day be a five-star joint! Minor complaint: the WiFi in the room wouldn’t work unless you stood right next to the door, and it was hit or miss even then. The window coverings also didn’t shut fully, which isn’t ideal for its location. BIG complaint: there was hair all over the bathroom, in the bed, and on the pillows. Makeup stains, some trash under the dresser and bed. It was pretty gross, but not intolerable. Otherwise the rooms and buildings were beautiful and the staff were friendly. The binder with all the information was also a plus. But the one thing I care about most is having a clean space."

The high ceilings and charming decor were an absolute delight as were the historic photos and classification art for native plants, bird species and more displayed on the walls. The location was centrally located and within walking distance of many attractions and restaurants. The gentleman at the front desk in the morning was a total joy and even insisted upon sharing some of his instant oatmeal packets with us when we asked where we could find oatmeal."

Stayed a few nights","The Andrew Hotel is in the perfect location! It was so easy to get to downtown San Francisco or nearby meeting locations for booked trip advisor adventures!
Things to know:
- There is an additional fee you have to pay the hotel, even after you paid through Airbnb. The host told me you pay this service fee because their taxes are different from the state you book in.
- I was told that my room gets clean every other day by one of the employees. I had to remind staff to clean my room and I had to ask for clean towels every day.
Other than that, it’s located in the heart of San Francisco—and that is a major pro!"

When we landed at SFO, I spoke with one of the concierges who promptly had our room prepared - hours ahead of the scheduled time! The housekeeping staff are absolutely lovely - got to connect with some of them since we share the same ethnic background (Filipino). The room was a bit toasty at first but we got used to it. The location is strategic in that the Powell Street station for BART is not very far, so finding the hotel was easy. In addition, this made our daily travels a breeze. Overall, this has been a wonderful experience and we hope to stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","It was hot the whole time. Couldn’t adjust heat. Fan was broken and made a lot of noise. You could open the windows but bugs would come in. I don’t see the point in adding cleaning fee’s or maintenance fees if they don’t do any cleaning. They only replaced the garbage. That was it. I didn’t even get refills on toiletries . Even when I asked for some I didn’t get it. The staff at the desk seemed kind, curious, and showed good manners. So I won’t fault them. All except one or two. Even for a lower price this hotel didn’t seem like a great deal. I can’t say I’d recommend against staying here, but I wouldn’t recommend it either. It’s suitable to maybe crash at for a night, maybe if you were at the club or something and need a place to sleep for a few hours. Maybe staying 1 day max."

It is compact and no-frills but has everything that a casual visitor to SF would need: a clean, functional bathroom with shampoo/soap and hair dryer; clean bed and linens; small but serviceable kitchenette (microwave, sink, mini fridge, tea kettle with teas, Keurig machine with coffee pods). The room overlooks a back garden, which is private but also provides some light and air to this ground-floor unit. It is located in a very quiet residential area but is a very easy walk to Golden Gate park and to more commercial areas for eating and shopping. Su provided all the information needed to access the room before I arrived, and I was never in need of anything more from my hosts during my stay."

The bed was soft and large and the table in the room was perfect to work remote with an outlet nearby. The bathroom was stocked with shower toiletries and towels provided.

The area felt safe and we were able to find parking easily compared to other places. The host was so helpful and allowed us to leave our bags earlier than check in. This was a last minute trip for us and I really appreciate how available the host was to answer any questions I had. I would definitely stay here again!

Stayed one night","Su's cozy suite was very cozy and clean. I lived in SF for many years and so I knew the neighborhood and the surroundings.
Su obviously cares about her customers: she offers to hold luggage for customers as all of San francisco is plagued by smash and grab robberies. (Never leave anything in your car -- anywhere in the city.) She was very helpful in her airbnb communications. I had a problem with my phone airbnb app so I was the one that had a hard time reaching her that way. So I highly recommend Su's to visitors. The only problem I had is that I did not know how to work the Keurigh coffee maker and I also could not find how to turn up and down the heat. So better instructions on how to do things in the suite would be helpful. But those things were minor. I would go back it is a great location."

Fantastic location, 2.5 blocks off the Geary bus line (starting point for going anywhere), 2 blocks from outstanding coffee shop, golden gate park just up the hill (go toward 22nd to get in …. I struggled a bit at first). Keyless locks and double entrances, so felt totally safe. Clement st full of restaurants, about a pleasant 10-15 block walk. High end wine store on Geary (Blackwell) if that’s your thing. May seem a bit outside of the usual hotspots, by using Geary magic you can get anywhere fast (the bus is VERY frequent). I’d easily stay again."

Kitchen area had small fridge, electric hot water kettle, and a Keurig coffee machine with coffee capsules. Also dishes, glasses, mugs, and cutlery available. Neighborhood is safe with free street parking on her street or within a block away. Just follow Su's information about parking. The place was spotless, sparkling clean, and no dust anywhere! Large bed with good mattress, not too soft or too firm. Large comfy, warm duvet blanket if weather gets cool. Also iron and ironing board. Bathroom spacious, nice hotel quality. I would definately stay here again and can highly recommend Su's place. I think she also has a larger unit nextdoor available to rent, too. Thank you, Su!"

As for location, it's in a quiet neighborhood with some decent restaurants within walking distance. We took busses and Ubers around town and it worked out. The place itself is clean with a nice size bathroom and tiny kitchenette. I tried to use the Keurig one morning but I couldn't figure it out.
We had a couple small issues that were relatively minor: a nighttime drum-playing neighbor, and a tv with no wifi connectivity. They weren't big deals. I'm not sure I'd stay here again - I just think I would want more space next time."

A couple of side notes, the place is tight, I think anymore than 2 people this place is too small, there is another area that is rented out/Airbnb and it is very easy to hear people just walking around and moving about, not sure how this could be improved, and lastly there were a lot of ants in the room, this may just be seasonal but I will say I told su and she said she would clean it right away."

You get panoramic views of the Pacific coast and can hear the surf crashing the beach and rocks! I was also a little worried about staying in the Airstream because I had never “camped” before, but a quick orientation phone call from the owners and everything was SO EASY! We had no problems with having enough battery power or water… it was like being in a very private condo with a million dollar view! I highly recommend this property if you are looking for a private getaway where you just want to sit on the deck, drink wine, and enjoy the beautiful scenery!"

If you’re questioning the comfortableness of a camper bed, stop questioning. We slept SO GOOD and falling asleep to waves also helps. The space was very clean and had everything we needed. Instructions for filling the water tank were clear and easy as well as operation everything else. The guest manual was fun and quirky too! Say hi to Bill on your way in and out (you’ll get it when you stay there).
Deano and Kristi are great hosts. I met them on the property and they are just all around great people…the type you want to kick back with over dinner and drinks. Very responsive and helpful.

This was my first stay in an airstream, and the instructions were super helpful. I did have a small issue with the hot water towards the end of our stay, but it didn't impact much overall.

I needed a little help finding the road that led to the airstream, so I called Kristi and she picked right up right away and helped guide me to the right location.
The location itself is unbeatable, unique, and beautiful. I spent hours sitting on the deck watching the ocean and the waves hit the beach. The sunset was beautiful, but my favorite was honestly when it was a little bit overcast. The wind brought out the waves, and it was amazing to gaze out at the scene out in front of me. I would come back every weekend if could! I would highly recommend for anyone who is looking to get away, experience the outdoors, but have a nice/warm spot to come back to."

The hosts, Kristi and Deano, communicated patiently and clearly to make sure we were confident in our care for the rv and during the stay. We have never used an rv or generator and it was not an issue. Our two small dogs loved exploring the hillside while we relaxed by the firepit. Watching the sunset the first night was magical. Most of our stay was during a big wind/rain storm, but we were cozy un the rv and got to watch the big waves and listen to the relaxing sounds of rain on the trailer. During breaks in the weather, we walked the dogs along the private road on the property.
Will definitely stay again!"

There are also groceries, gas and restaurant nearby. There are a lot to do around the area. We grilled our first day and order take out on your second day. We really enjoyed the ocean view too, we stayed outside the patio most of our stay and played board games at night. Appreciate the host for providing a variety of games.

Stayed a few nights","Deano's Airstream sits on a rare spectacular piece of land overlooking the ocean. It felt private with nothing but sounds of the wind and the ocean. The Airstream was just a few months old and was pristine with the most comfortable bed and nice linens, and all the basic kitchen and bbq supplies for easy cooking. The fire pit was awesome too, making breakfast outside in 45 degree morning fun and comfortable. Instructions on how to live off the grid in the Airstream were super clear with short videos that made things like refilling the water tank a breeze. The beaches and walks along the bluff or into the Redwood forest nearby were gorgeous. And don't be worried about rain - the Airstream is cozy and warm so a passing storm one evening was nothing but fun. Deano and Kristi were welcoming and kind, making extra accommodations for us on a difficult week for us with the loss of our cat just a day before we arrived. Thank you for a wonderful escape!"

Deano has thought of everything for your luxury glamping experience. We did not want to leave and can’t wait to get back. It’s worth every penny!! It’s literally a priceless experience.

We loved sitting outside admiring the view and watching sunrises and sunsets. We were so lucky to have great weather. We will miss listening to the sound of the ocean and waves. Many beaches to explore in the area, quaint towns and scenic
surroundings or just relax and enjoy the peaceful setting at the trailer."

Much needed in the midst of life’s hustle and bustle. We had everything in the airstream and Deano’s instructions to make everything smooth made it easy. Would definitely come back and have already recommended to friends and family.

Stayed a few nights","Unique experience in a peaceful & beautiful location with amazing Pacific ocean views, especially at sunset.
We slept with the windows open to sleep to the sounds of ocean waves. And woke up to a stunning view.
I would describe as a notch above glamping. Bambi (our airstream) was stocked with everything we could think to use. And the firepit was perfect.
Kristi & Deano were super communicative at check in & if we had Qs. Flexible self check-in.
Tip: If you need to work remotely there’s wifi but it was a weak signal. Used my phone hotspot though without issue. And cell phone service signal is good.
Looking forward to returning!"

Do know there are a few more airstreams that are rented out on the property in addition to this one. Maybe I missed reading that but it was not problem because everyone keeps to themselves. We would definitely return but next time we will pack 1/2 what we brought."

Basically, you're on a bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean. With a deck, fire pit, BBQ, what could be more tranquil? Pricey but if you're not into the hotel scene, this place is it."

Stayed a few nights","We were the 2nd people to stay at Deano’s and Kristi’s Airstream and we loved the location and the view. We could fall asleep to the ocean waves far beneath us at Tunitas Beach, and have a glamping experience which we have never done before (we have switched to hotels with private bathrooms rather than camping in a tent on inflatable pads). The location was south of Half Moon Bay, and we were just a short drive from there, Moss beach, and we even drove over to the Cantor Museum on the Stanford Campus one day, and back. Ending the day with a grilled meal watching the sunset with friends, and then sharing s’mores over the gas firepit was wonderful!"

Stayed with a pet","What an awesome idea - park an Airstream in a secluded spot above the Pacific Ocean, and open it up so everyone can enjoy the beautiful sunset views.
The one we stayed in is the epitome of a luxury camper. I was amazed at how spacious it is inside. It has a nicer bed, kitchen, and bathroom than my very own house! And the deck outside with the chairs and fire pit, with that view, is pure heaven. We really enjoyed watching the sunset and the moon rise, and roasting marshmallows and s’mores - all complements of the host!
Deano was great, very proactive in making sure we knew how to operate everything. It’s a little more complex than a hotel room. You have to think about the water and battery levels, and you need to run the generator occasionally to use the outlets. But Deano walks you through everything, and the house guide is very helpful.
And the location is perfect - you’re surrounded by beaches, Half Moon bay, lavender farms, and pumpkin patches. We’re definitely coming back!"

Group trip",We were in San Francisco for a family wedding at the Presidio so the location of the Air BnB was perfect and only a 10 minute drive. The Safeway is a 5 minute drive away and the view out the front is fabulous. I had my 85 year old parents with me and they enjoyed sitting at the window and drinking coffee each morning - it was a perfect location as they mostly stayed in while other family went about and enjoyed the sites. Breakfast and lunch we stayed in and went out for dinner - great restaurants nearby in the area. We were able to fit a Toyota Highlander and smaller Nissan Kicks in the garage one in front of the other - we didn’t have a lot of issues in and out of the garage but sometimes had to move a car out to get to the other - the doorway to the garage is narrow so one must park carefully. Getting out of the garage wasn’t difficult since there was a traffic light that helped in stopping traffic and also a parking lane to back into.

Situated right on the Marina next to the Palace of Fine Arts, you are right in the middle of a beautiful safe part of San Francisco. We could walk to the beach. Safeway store was a mile away with parking. Uber eats were super fast. We rented bikes to see the city - road across the Golden Gate Bridge. We kept our car safely parked in Garage. Warning we had a mid-size SUV and we fit, A large SUV (Suburban) might not fit. Also provided quick access to Muir Woods. First class, luxury location. You will really enjoy. We will back!"

This was a family trip to the Bay Area with our three kids, to tour colleges. The views were gorgeous and there were a lot of walking opportunities to Palace of Fine Arts, The Presidio and Chrissy Field. There was even a view of Alcatraz right out the front windows and a view of The Palace of Fine Arts out the back windows.
My only con which is super minor is if you’re a light sleeper, take the back bedrooms because the main front bedroom does get a little more of the traffic noise from the intersection down below. But this was minor and didn’t bother my husband and I at all. The view and location made up for that and we would 100% stay here again!"

Washer & Dryer came in handy as well - it was nice that detergent and fabric softener were also available for use.
Beds were very comfortable, particularly the memory foam pillows & mattresses. Water pressure was good as well.
Like most garages in SFO it is small for a minivan & we opted to park outside which worked well.
It was definitely a fantastic stay and if we are back in SFO we would love to stay here again.

I would definitely recommend this spot for anyone needing a little private space as they visit (it’s about 15min drive into the city where you’d get drinks or dinner), or some new scenery if they already live here. Free parking close to the house. Grocery was about a 15 min walk. Thank you to Aleksandra for being such gracious hosts!"

It was very clean, little personal touches, and the ability to let the dogs directly outside was great. The bed was comfortable, the couch and coffee table were great for a remote work situation. The parking (as mentioned) was ample down the street, was not too far of a walk (even in the rain it was fine!). I felt very safe walking the neighborhood with my dogs. The hosts checked in with me the day after check in, which is awesome! All stay away, and highly recommend."

The unit does not have AC and could use a little bit more storage space, potentially in the form of shelves/cabinets. The bed was a little squeaky (not sure what’s to be done about that) and noticed a few ants but host confirmed the traps would be replaced.
Host was responsive and allowed us to early check-in, provided additional towels, and even offered to store our luggage at check-out if needed.

I wish it was a little bit closer to the BART station — it’s about a 15-20 minute walk. The walk is easy and you can cut through a safe college campus, but it’s not super close. The only other thing that would have been helpful for me is a desk or some sort of higher table besides just a coffee table."

Aleksandra even proactively messaged me during our stay to ask if there was anything they could assist with. Truly the best host-customer service I have ever received in an Airbnb.
The property was pristinely clean and had all amenities as listed. The patio area out back was also very nice and gave us some extra room to relax. Additionally, there was a small amenities basket with items such as razors, makeup wipes, and mints, which was a very hospitable touch.

Stayed a few nights","Aleksandra is definitely a SUPERHOST! She answered any questions we had and was available when needed. We had an electric rental car, and she accommodated us by allowing us to charge our car right there at her home. I thought that was just super amazing! My husband and I took in a movie, and I asked for a throw blanket, in which she gladly accommodated.
Her place really gives a 5-star hotel vibe. The room is very classy, sleek and welcoming, with beautiful decor! The bathroom is very polished, modern and sophisticated. The kitchenette invites you to cook, so I did, lol. And the patio is uniquely and beautifully designed. A place to just chill with a nice glass of wine giving a cool ambiance.
Thanks, Aleksandra, for being an awesome SuperHost. If we or our family/friends are ever in the San Francisco area, we will surely check for availability! And we highly recommend you to all that read this review."

Overall it was great, so I recommand this place! The only thing I would say is that it's very small for two people..especially if you stay longer than a few days. We didn't really have place to put our luggages so we had to pu them on the floor in our way. Same thing for the kitchen, it's really small so you can be 2 at the same time.

Stayed a few nights","This is a great place for a solo traveler or a couple that won’t spend much time inside. It’s off the beaten path and in a quiet neighborhood. I’d recommend having a car because parking is fairly easy in the area. Very clean, comfortable bed, remodeled bathroom with great shower, and lovely kitchen for basic cooking. The only thing to note is that the place is small and there’s a large set of glass doors that open directly onto the shared patio. While there are blackout blinds, it lacks full privacy on the sides of the blinds if someone is on the deck/patio and you have the blackout blinds up to get some sun. There is a transparent blind in front but you can see through it a bit from the outside. Just something to know. Otherwise great pace and great communication. So easy…"

The studio was tastefully decorated with everything you can ask for! We loved the outdoor space as well as it was a good place to relax after a day of exploring.

We ran out of coffee pods and toilet paper during our stay and the host brought us refill supplies within minutes of me emailing her. Unit is very small but well laid out and furnished. When I booked this Airbnb I thought it was one unit in someone’s home, and looks like it is actually four small units in someone’s home! We hardly heard any noise from other Airbnb guests but we did pass some in the hallway on the way out. No problem for us at all but just want to clarify because I didn’t realize that from the listing (in case anyone is looking to avoid interacting with other travelers). Overall, very good experience! My favorite was having a free laundry machine accessible for my dirty clothes :) and also drinking morning coffee on the patio was 👌👌"

Kitchen is equipped with single burner, microwave, fridge, and equipment needed to make meals. We enjoyed our coffee and breakfast on the beautifully styled, comfortable back patio. Hosts were very responsive to the needs of their guests, including graciously securing our bags before check-in and after check-out."
