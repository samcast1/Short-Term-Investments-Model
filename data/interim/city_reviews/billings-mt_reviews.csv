Stayed one night","While I selected “accurately described”, Amy’s place completely exceeded our expectations based on the listing. This is a small 1 bedroom place, but the organization, amenities and lack of clutter make it feel spacious. The kitchen is larger, better stocked and more functional than many places twice the size, and the open floor plan with large island is perfect for meal prep and eating. The entire place was absolutely spotless, and was also amazingly quiet in spite of being close to the airport. We will definitely stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","This was perhaps my favorite place I’ve stayed at yet! I absolutely LOVED it and felt welcome, cozy, and at home! The location is private, beautiful, and made me feel like I was having my own little retreat. There were so many nice touches - including fresh eggs one morning. The only “bad” part of my stay is that I’m now addicted to Nespresso coffee. 🤣
I’m already booking my next stay and have personally recommended it to family, friends, and co-workers.
I cannot say enough positive things about this perfect little house (with full size furnishings)."

Stayed a few nights","An absolute gem of a home! From the time I booked online to arriving to the AirBnB there was excellent and friendly communication with Amy/hosts. The home is charming and well appointed and I wanted for nothing. The Nespresso machine in the kitchen was a nice surprise. The washer/dryer worked well and helped me pack a lot less than needed. The home is conveniently located near the airport, MSU-Billings and Downtown and is a short drive to the West End of town. I slept peacefully each night- the neighborhood and surroundings are inviting and the fresh mountain air was invigorating! Close to the Rims, Swords park and the new running/hiking trail. I hope I find myself a guest in the home again for my next work visit to Billings!"

The house was very clean upon arrival, the well stocked kitchen was great (to include the French Press for coffee as we had ours packed). I would highly recommend anyone staying in Billings to checkout Amy’s place. It is conveniently located to alot of things. Especially the campus in town if you’re visiting or passing through. Thanks Amy!"

The kitchen was fully stocked, and that made it easy to cook in (which is what I did for the entirety of my stay). There is also a great viewing spot of the city just a short drive away up on Rimrock Road. I would highly recommend this AirBnb if you are in Billings! I will definitely stay here again if I find myself passing through or visiting."

We loved the cozy home and the decor was amazing and perfectly done. This place was very clean and the kitchen was fully stocked! We were provided with a snack basket which came in handy after we arrived from driving in from Cody that day. The location was so close to the airport which came in handy for our EARLY morning flight the next morning. If we are ever in the Billings area again we would stay here again! It was more comfortable and quiet than staying at a hotel.

Stayed about a week","This Mini Mountain View Getaway is amazing. In the shadow of Billings Rim Rocks (sandstone cliffs that boarder the northern edge of the city), this ADU is new, modern and lovingly built by the owners. I used it as ""home base"" while rediscovered my hometown after a 54 years' absence.
It's a walk to MSU and just a few minutes to downtown. I saw a deer, a duck (and other fowl), and numerous rabbits who make the outskirts of Billings their home. It has a small but nice view of the Rim Rocks south of town, and I was able to watch distant thunder storms from the front porch. All-in-all, a gem of a place to stay while in Billings."

Amy has such a good style in this home. It was also nice to be able to pull my car off the road and park it somewhere safe. This home is down the street from Montana State University Billings. It was quite, tucked back, yet it was close enough to walk to the Main Street to get a bite to eat or a coffee, or walk thru some of the campus.
I highly recommend staying here!"

Stayed with a pet","Everything with Amy's place was as expected or better. She had nice touches of snacks, sweets and sparkling waters in a basket on the counter waiting for us. The location was fantastic. Really close to downtown, the medical center, the college and the airport. I was able to easily walk from the place to my doctors appointment right down the street. The side street it is on was quiet, peaceful and a perfect spot to walk my dog around. The place was clean, the bed was comfortable and it was nicely setup and decorated. All in all I would highly recommend the place if you need a cozy, safe and clean place to stay in Billings."

Stayed a few nights","This little place was super cute inside and out. Easy to find, the driveway/parking is a bit tricky, but not bad at all. The decor and extra touches were beautiful. I love the colors, finishes and charm. It was pretty clean. No smells, enough supplies to grab food to cook and make coffee. We enjoyed the two large TV's for movies. It was 62 degrees on arrival and did take a while to warm up. By the second day it was pretty comfortable, we also had a snow storm so the weather was nasty cold. If you go in the winter, bring some warm slippers and an extra blanket if you prefer warmer temps....it is MT! Cute little book of memories for guests, would definitely stay again! Oh, it is really close to campus, airport (which multiple planes did wake us up at 5am Friday), Billings clinic, grocery store, and some great restaurants. Only a 15 min drive to more shopping. :)"

Stayed a few nights","This was my second stay at one of Jenna's properties. The first was great, this one even better! The aparment was exactly as pictured, well stocked, and immaculately clean. Nice, quiet location with easy access to all of Billings. LOVED the coffee shop downstairs!! The only small issue we ran into was difficulty locking the balcony and exterior building doors. Initially was told by co-host Crystal, that this was a known problem and couldn't be fixed, which was discomforting, but a quick follow-up response from co-host Josh with the ""trick"" to get them locked saved the day and made us feel much more secure. This was addressed within 24 hours, and there was never an issue securing the door leading directly into the apartment, so I wouldn't consider it a major secuity problem. I would suggest informing future guests in advance of the issue and ""trick"" though. Overall, both my travel partner and I felt very comfortable here, and I would absolutely recommend and stay again!"

Stayed with kids","This home was our destination after a full day in the car and easily entering a clean and comfortable home brought major relief and rest. It truly was kid friendly - there were plenty of toys, games, and even dishes geared toward children that made the transition to a new environment seamless."

Stayed with kids","Nestled into a quiet newer development, we felt the value was great, the location was clean and safe, and we would definitely stay again should we be back thru and it is has open dates.
It was nice to just sit and take a load off after a long day of hiking about. Our teen had the space they needed away from us parents vs the traditional hotel space that feels cramped and usually messy.
To the hosts, thank you for the ability to reserve your space!"

Stayed one night","I’d say overall not a bad place to stay, a couple things we didn’t love was the parking and the bedroom. There was very little parking in the area, we ended up having to park down the street and walk. And the beds were extremely squeaky so we didn’t get very good sleep as the bed was very loud if you move at all. Other than that the house was very clean, and had all the proper amenities that we needed that not a lot of places have."

Stayed one night","Absolutely perfect for our overnight stay in Billings. The home was exactly as described and pictured. We were so pleased with the cleanliness. Everything was so nice and clean.
If we ever need a place to stay in Billings, we won’t even think of staying anywhere else. Couldn’t have been any more perfect.
Also, the ease of checking in and out was another plus."

Jenna and Rebekah thought of everything! Coffee and mugs and nice touches like bottled water were left for us. This place is sparkling clean and so quaint. The patio is so cute as well but it was raining so we could not enjoy it. Highly recommend this cute, stylish, cozy home!"

Stayed with kids","As we drove up to the house, it felt like a movie set. There were friendly neighbors and families walking around outside happily greeting us. After 3 solid days of driving, this wonderful townhouse was a much needed break for us. In fact, we didn't want to leave! Our daughters absolutely loved the toy room!
The house is beautifully decorated, and we enjoyed all of the little touches like how the towels were laid out for all of us! It felt so welcoming.
We had a great night's sleep as it was so peaceful and quiet!
Since the area is so new, Google directions brought us to a closed road. As the neighborhood is being constructed, I would recommend driving to the house via Elysian Rd.
I really like that there was a washer and dryer! If you would like to do laundry, bring your own laundry detergent."

There was a slight odor as if a 420 smoker may have stayed before me. Water was cut off the first night due to construction. The city sent the host a written notice almost 2 weeks prior (at least that’s what the city said when I called in) but the host didn’t pass that to me. After a long work day, getting in late and not being about to shower was a bummer. Overall a friendly host who adapted to my changes in dates and was so friendly. I would consider staying again, but some more thorough cleaning would be nice to see."

She talked to the tenant regarding keeping the dogs from barking and offered to refund the remaining days of our stay if we wanted to find another place. It was Memorial Day weekend and finding another place would have been hard. Jenna stated that the tenant planned to be gone for the weekend so we decided to stay. Our niece was graduating so we would be spending alot of time with her. However, the times we were at the apartment the dogs did bark. We don't think the tenant was gone for any length of time at all. In fact on Monday afternoon we think the tenant was gone and the dogs were left inside barking. Also, there was alot of road noise on Grand."

There was also a great sitting area in the backyard with a fire table, but we didn’t use it as it was cool outside being the 2nd of May. The kitchen was well equipped and stocked with all kinds of extras such as spices, oils and Saran Wrap etc. . A Keurig was supplied along with lots of coffee pods. A nice touch was the Welcome binder with local information for things to see and do and contact information. The snack basket including popcorn and cereal bars and treats was also a plus. Location was great as well, being just off a main drag, it was very quiet and still close enough to walk to stores for shopping or lounges. The touch keypad to entrance was also nice, no key needed. Hosts were very responsive and enquired if everything was to our liking and if we needed anything else, which we didn’t."

Stayed a few nights","Good value, clean, and comfortable. But selecting this unit has reminded me why I appreciate whole homes…lack of noise. The adjoining unit, which appears to be rented on a long term basis, was noisy. Barking dogs, loud conversations and television. Normally, this wouldn’t be much of an issue, except the two units have an a connecting door that you can hear everything through. If you prefer a peaceful stay, I would look elsewhere."

Stayed over a week","What a cozy, comfortable, clean place to stay for my visit with my Mom and Sister. I couldn't believe how close I was to my Mom's assisted living facility, right across the street and my sister just down the road not far at all. A grocery store and gas station less than a block away and other shopping not that far away. It took me a little bit to figure-out the keypad on the door since it was dark when I arrived but so easy to get in and to lock the door after. Jenna was very nice and responded quickly when I text her. I got an added bonus: a gentleman had the driveway cleared of snow and even brushed the snow off my car before I left for the day. Thank-you for the kindness! I am hoping I will be lucky enough to be able to stay with Jenna at what is, ""The Best 1 Bedroom in Billings!"

It’s always clean, has all of the amenities and it’s super convenient to everything and close to where my mom lives. I also like the warming touches they add for my visits which is usually around the holidays. There was a sweet lighted Christmas tree, and little holiday decor touches throughout. I also like that there is a full kitchen with large fridge. Someone lives upstairs with dogs so you will hear them sometimes but it’s not that often. The host is always very communicative and the privacy and ease of getting to and from is great. I will definitely plan to stay here again!"

From the time that we walked into the house, and saw the lit Christmas tree and decorations, you could see how well prepared it was. Little things like more Kerigs than we could use, fluffy, comfortable, bathroom towels, a cabinet full of spices, whatever we needed to cook, or eat, a bathroom stocked with anything that you could need. Every time you opened another cabinet or door you found something else That Jenna had thought you might need. This was a wonderful place to stay at, and we would recommend it to anybody."

There was a minor issue with the bathtub faucet, which ultimately rendered the shower unusable. However, Austen made right without hesitation (and without being asked). This gesture, coupled with the overall cleanliness and comfort of the space, will make staying again a no-brainer."

Stayed a few nights","I and two of my older sisters stayed at Austens when we were visiting another sister in a nursing home. It was a perfect location and when we checked in on a cold night, it was nice and warm and welcoming. It had everything we needed to enjoy our time together. The beds were so comfy and my sister was threatening to steal one of the pillows lol. Everything was what we needed. We enjoyed a full size fridge, with water bottles. There were 3 TVs and we enjoyed a Netflix movie one night. Because of the weather we needed to move our reservation up a day and because of the weather we needed to add a day. It was all done very quickly and respectfully. We all agreed we would stay there again as it was so close to everything and we felt safe."

The bathroom toilet is very tiny and should probably be replaced with a normal height toilet. My husband it 6”2 and felt like he was sitting on a small stool. There is mold growing in the shower caulking that is unpleasant to look at, and there is low water pressure when taking a shower. It is noisy from the upstairs in the mornings. Other than that the place was clean and comfortable. Beds are cozy and firm. Neighborhood is quiet as well."

Bedrooms are much more spacious than they appear, which is great if you need to sort yourself & things out after or before pursuing the outdoor activites like Yelllowstone, Badlands, etc. surrounding Billings. As road trippers the well-running washer/dryer was our fave amenity; w/ the large TV & fast Wifi a runner-up. Kitchen isn't necessarily set up for standard home cooking - no stove or oven. But there are a lot of appliances to be able to heat or ready-made foods. A solid, graciously affordable stay - would recommend."

Stayed about a week","If you are looking for a beautiful place to stay both inside and out look no further! From the moment we stepped out of our car all of the holiday stress melted away and the relaxation set in. The home was cozy and tastefully decorated. It was spotless and well stocked. The linens and towels were high quality and the beds were comfortable. We were lucky enough to be there during a lightly falling snow that perfectly flocked all of the trees. It was magical! We were glad we had a vehicle with 4-wheel drive. The area was secluded and safe but only a few minute drive to interstate. One of our top 5 Airbnb’s! We will definitely be back! Kelvin was very accommodating, due to weather we had to come a day early and stay a day later than expected."

Stayed over a week","When I arrived, I was a little confused because this property has multiple units and I didn't at first know which one I was staying in. Finally figured it out after going through emails from AirBnB and David. Once inside, I was very pleased with the room/apartment. Small, but very comfortable for 1 person. Was very pleased to see such a well stocked kitchen and recent renovations. I was able to settle in right away, and when my circumstances changed during my stay, I was happy that David allowed me to extend my stay, twice. Now, the negatives, which David has absolutely no control over. I had been warned by my siblings before my arrival that this is in a ""sketchy"" area of Billings, but I have to say I never had any problems at all in this regard. Parking is on a side street near the room, and this street intersects with a VERY busy street next to the room. Lastly, I had to run the hot water a long time before any hot water would come. Final thought, I would stay again."

Stayed a few nights","Our first contact was asking about parking - we have a dually that can be hard to maneuver downtown. The host was quick to respond, directed us on how to park, and would be available if needed , for our late arrival.
At first glance, we saw homeless coming up to the property. The outside of the property buildings were older and run down. When we got to our unit, it was easy to get into, clean and tidy. There was information available about our room and safety information, giving us some confidence that our vehicle would be safe outside. We did appreciate the black out window panels for added safety too.
Everything in the unit was working properly, lots of hot water for a few showers, tv worked great. Similar size to a hotel room with all the amenities of home.
It was a great place for the price, especially if you wanted to be close to downtown, like we did. For light sleepers, be warned that the street next door can be loud.
Exactly as advertised and we were happy."

The outside looks a little daunting, but once youstep into the apartment, all doubt in the space melts away.
The apartment is small, but welcoming and comfortable. it was the perfect size for my husband and I. The only hiccup was when nature threw a quick freeze at us and froze the pipes. But when we contacted David and his team, in the same hour they had our water back up and running with no issue. this is a wonderful space hosted by amazing men who really care about hosting. Super affordable, cozy, and comfortable. thank you so much!"

This has been a 3 month stay for me in Montana, that’s pretty long for turnarounds. I’ve listened to all the complaints from coworkers about there hotel stays throughout this job. This by far is the best stay I have ever had on a job. The convenience of the amenities, location, and surrounding stores were hands down the best experience I’ve had for a out of town job. I would recommend this location to everyone in my Industry that is going to work in Montana. I will also be coming back and staying at this same location for the next turnaround as well. You can’t ask for a better host in Mr. David for everything he has helped me out with."

Stayed a few nights","This place seemed, at first, to be a bargain. However, these use to be efficiency low income housing. They are in a dangerous and unsafe part of town. There were homeless folks walking around asking for money everytime we came back. They are located on one of the busiest streets in Billings. We heard traffic all night long. We had to buy ear plugs to sleep. The inside looks nice but very small. The second night the heater went out and we had to use a cheap electric space heater to keep warm. We went to wash some clothes and the washing machine smelled so bad we had to open the window and door to air it out. We tried to clean the washer but it was no use. Lastly, my wife had morning sickness and wasn't feeling well so we were about 30 minutes late checking out. I explained this to the cleaning person and he just snapped at me. The owner called and told me we had to get out. I explained what was going on and he just said check out is at 11 your late and I should charge you another day. Wenever asked for a refund for having to sleep in the cold or not being able to do laundry and they were all extremely rude. I would find some where else to stay"

Stayed over a week","David was a great host! Communication was immediate and having Alfredo on site they could fix things same day. I am a travel nurse and stayed with David for the 3 months during the Covid 19 crisis. In such uncertain times it was comforting to know I had a safe and clean place to come home to. I knew I could rely on him if I needed anything. He asked me several time if there was anything he could get for me or do to help me during the pandemic. The apartment was exactly as described and served all my needs as a travel nurse. Having laundry, full kitchen, cable/wifi and a nice updated bathroom made my day to day functioning and 15 weeks of straight overtime easier. I'd highly recommend for any travel nurse working at Billings Clinic or St.Vincent's as you can walk to the hospitals. I chose the location because it was close to downtown and I could walk to several very nice bars and restaurants. I also ran in North Park everyday."

Stayed over a week","As honestly advertised, this unit is in a bit of a rougher part of town; however, I had absolutely no issues. Walked to and from the hospital every morning and evening without incident. The unit is cutely decorated and has nearly everything you will need. Only thing I could have used is an iron. David was a great host, super responsive and upfront about the accommodations. I would stay again and would recommend this spot to others."

Stayed a few nights","This is a diamond in the rough. We were forewarned that there was hail damage to our room, and we were a little concerned about the area when we pulled in. They are in the middle of remodeling, so the outside does look a little worse for wear. BUT the room was really nice inside. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean and modernly furnished. We enjoyed our stay. The WiFi was having issues, so if you’re relying on quick internet for your stay, be aware. Overall, a great room for the price!"

The bed is comfortable and the TV has cable. As others reviews have said, the WiFi isn’t the best, but it suffices. Street parking is only steps away. All in all, a great place to stay in Billings."

Stayed over a week","Cozy apartment right in the middle of Billings. The outside of the building could use some TLC, but the inside is pretty nice, quiet, and comfortable. The area always seems to have a few homeless (and large rabbits?) wandering around as there is a youth shelter and a a block over is an adult shelter and soup kitchen. But I had no issues coming or going beyond just a few people trying to panhandle me when I walked a few blocks to the store. I never felt unsafe, but I did make sure to lock my car and just be aware as you do in any city. Washer and dryer was handy, kitchen had plenty of space, tv was fine, and the bed is very soft and comfortable. The fridge is full-size and the bathroom, while small, had good water pressure and hot water. My only complaints would be the wifi is not the greatest but did eventually work okay, and maybe the bed linens could be improved. But overall for the price this was an excellent stay and I would recommend it to anyone."

Stayed over a week","Where should I start! It's a great airbnb and I highly recommend if you need to stay in or around Billings. I stayed at the apartment for 3 months- the location is absolutely perfect if you have work at the hospital (well the location is perfect for easy access to everything in billings). Everything in downtown billings is in walking distance, uber is also a good option if walking isn't your thing and you don't have a car. There is a parking area on the side of the apartments or street parking is free (I always parked on the street- never had any issues). Microwave, dishwasher, washer, dryer, kuerig all in the unit! The bed is heavenly! Other reviewers said the wifi was spotty- recommend sitting on the couch next to the window or at the foot of the couch (wifi is more reliable in that spot) OR they are many amazing coffee shops near by with absolutely fantastic coffee and free wifi. Others also mentioned the outside looks worrisome/ sketchy-I never had a single problem or ran into any trouble and I worked night shift- so I would go to the anytime fitness or the 24/7 Walmart at 2am and never had any issues. If I had a question about anything David would respond within minutes and alfredo was right there to help. All in all- stay here! Highly recommend!"

Place was just as described in terms of a rougher location but we had no problems at all. It is by a busy street so there is traffic noise most of the time. It kind of became white noise after a few days though. Recommend a cellular WiFi connection if you need it to work consistently though. Overall, place had everything we needed, very little we did not need and was a good value!"

Simply put, you can transplant the interior of each studio to any major city or vacation hotspot in the world and it wouldn't feel out of place - the furniture and accoutrements are all comfortable and contemporary.
If you care to save money on accommodation, I wouldn't hesitate in recommending David's Airbnb over any of the ludicrously over-priced downtown options."

Stayed a few nights","The inside of the space is very lovely, but the outside was awful. It's hard to get past first impressions - my Lyft driver was hesitant to even drop me off - he walked me to the front door. I contacted David who was very kind/communicative. He assured me that it is a safe building and even dropped by - which I appreciated. But although walking to and from downtown was convenient - I would have rather stayed in a different area and walked/ubered/rented a car. There is a facility for runaways next door - so you have to pass a bunch of smoking teenagers that are covering the lawn - each time you go into town. I just never felt comfortable - and I lived in Downtown Atlanta for 12 years. I appreciate all of the care that went into the inside of the apartment - perhaps I would stay there if I wasn't by myself."

Stayed a few nights","Would definitely recommend this place to anyone.
The one negative was the location, I was intentionally frightened when I saw the location, but was amazed by the beauty of the studio once I walked. I felt like I was transported some place else! The location ended up being fine. Looks like there would be drugs/sketchy people around, but I saw no one. It was quite besides the occasional car. I ended up feeling very safe.
Now the good part, the studio is gorgeous! Everything is updated, there was cute decor, all the appliances needed with a long trip even though we were just there a weekend.
The WiFi was touch & go, but unless you NEED it, that wasn’t really an issue for us. I would definitely stay here or in another of the locations without a doubt!"

Stayed about a week","I stayed at Davids place for 2 days, at the beginning of my trip, but had previously booked other accommodations for about 5 days. I came back to David place for the entire 2nd week of my trip.
The location could not be better! EVERYTHING you need is literally within a 2 or 3 block radius. And being in town without a car it was perfect for my needs. I could walk for 5 to 10 min. and get to 3 popular Fast food chains, 2 Diners, a grocery store, a pharmacy, or a 24 hour gas station with a mini mart. There is also a neighborhood sports tavern right up the street with food and drinks, where you can watch a game on one of the TV's or gamble a little.
I understand that this kind of easy acccess and convenience isn't a priority for everyone. But there is a reason I didn't tell you about the laundromat that is practically across the street! And thats b'cuz Davids place has top of the line appliances, like the full sized, stacked, front loading washer and dryer! The new microwave and The Keurig coffee maker and a smart tv! There's even a dishwasher!
I could go on about the 2 foot thick memory foam mattress, but its starting to sound like I'm making it all up. But its all the truth. David you nailed it!"

I stayed at David's place for two months and was surprised to find the place more thoughtfully accommodated than my apartment back home. It sure beats any hotel room at least. I brought up two or three fairly important concerns throughout the course of my stay, and they were all addressed within a matter of hours. Overall, my communication with him was laid back and hands-off, which I particularly appreciated because I was working 80hr weeks on night shift. If you're visiting Billings for any reason, staying at one of David's units is a no-brainer."

Stayed about a week","Excellent Stay!!!!
From the moment I contacted David the communication was excellent. This was my first experience using Airbnb. I was nervous and didn't know what to expect. I have only one regret, that I didn't stay my first week in Billings at Davids place. First, David takes pride in what he provides for his guests and goes out of his way to accommodate his guests. He wanted to make sure our stay was comfortable and we were happy. The studio we rented was beautiful inside. The entire place is brand new. The studio was spotless, clean, and cozy. The bathroom tile is gorgeous. The shower is perfect with lots of hot water. The color scheme of the studio is professionally decorated from the tile to the color scheme. The bed was clean and comfortable. My 11 year old slept on the coach and his exact words were, ""Mom I don't want to get up this coach is so comfortable."" David was so nice to accommodate us with extra sheets, pillow, and blankets for my son.
The kitchen was well stocked more then we expected. In fact the entire place was stocked with hair soap, hair dryer, etc. We were able to cook every night instead of spending money to go out to eat. The best part was the laundry machines which made it so convinenant for us.
The studio is located close to downtown and convinenantly close to the highway. We felt very safe and secure in the studio.
There isn't enough good to say about this experience. If you plan to visit Billings this is the place to stay."

Stayed with kids","Unfortunate circumstances necessitated our protracted stay in Billings with some unique mobility needs. We searched many places for reduced steps into the house, a walk-in shower, and open and single level living spaces. This was exactly the right place. There are two steps up from the garage, which were manageable. The garage itself meant we didn’t have to worry about loading and unloading in uncertain conditions. The kitchen was the best stocked AirBnB kitchen I’ve ever seen! We also have two young children, and stays can be a bit nerve wracking if there are excessive decorations. Here everything was tastefully done but without dangerous fragility.
Another best-of-AirBnB qualities was our host, Megan. She was so responsive and kind, and genuinely cared about the quality of our stay. During a completely stressful time, she was a calm and steady reassurance. We just had nothing to worry about when it came to the basic and fundamental need for a safe haven. Thank you, Megan 💗"

The home is very clean, the master suite has a walk in tiled shower with wonderful soothing water pressure. The beds were so comfortable. Love the trundle bed that is a great idea! The living room was so comfy and we fell in love with the couch and are now looking for one for our house. The kitchen was perfect. We were only there 1 night so we did not need to use all the kitchen amenities that were provided. But is it well stocked. Megan thought of everything!

Everything went smoothly with the host. The house was clean and easy to access. Check-out checklist was simple. Welcome book provided many recommendations. Wish we had more time to explore the nearby river, parks, and hikes.
Would DEFINITELY stay again."

The house is well put together and was pretty child-proofed so we didn’t have to walk around hiding things from my two-year-old. The AC worked well and the beds were very comfortable (I love a soft and supportive bed and had a great night’s sleep). We also enjoyed having the attached garage and the side yard with the grill! We would love to stay again. Thank you!

The kitchen is great to cook in and the bed was extremely comfortable. Out on the deck was peaceful being able to look at the stars at night and have breakfast in the morning. The firepit outside kept us nice and toasty. A real nice treat was having heated flooring to walk on when waking up in the morning. Quite nice when you get ready to take a hot shower! While we didn’t get to see much wildlife close to the bungalow there were a good amount of deer on nearby property on the road up to it. Kelvin and his family were kind enough to let us visit and help feed their cattle on their property above the bungalows too! This made my wife’s day! We keep gettin surprised with every air bnb stay we have thinking it would be impossible for a stay to be better, but this place will be hard to beat. It is literally perfect!"

The surroundings were serene. The deck was a very nice addition for outdoor living to enjoy the breeze..sunrise and sunset with your favorite beverage in hand.
Kelvin was a fantastic host!!! very responsive to answering questions and making sure you were right at home.

It’s the little things that stood out to us, but as a whole I’m blown away. We wish we would have been staying longer so we could’ve enjoyed the peaceful atmosphere to the fullest extent. This was the best! 10/10 highly recommend. We will be back for sure the next time we come to Billings. Thank you for sharing your sweet tiny home with us!"

They put so much detail into this tiny house, and they thought of everything! From the clean and stocked bathroom and kitchen to the garage door and deck! I fell in love with Montana and the minimal lifestyle of Billings and this house sums it all up. The host had very good directions to the house, and kept in contact the entire stay for all my questions. We left feeling well rested and at peace. When we come back to Montana, we will definitely stay here again."

It's located in a neighborhood of older homes on a fairly busy street, but we found it very quiet and restful. All the listed amenities were available and Heather was immediately responsive whenever I reached out. What stands out most is the loving care and design style with which Heather has retouched and redone various areas -- most notably extensive modern tile work in kitchen and bath and refinished wood floors throughout.
This is an older home and it shows its age in some spaces; for example, windows are painted shut and generally hard to open if you like fresh air. The bathroom is tiny and not easy to use."
