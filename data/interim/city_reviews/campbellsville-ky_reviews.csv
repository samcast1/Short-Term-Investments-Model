Stayed one night",This lovely Airbnb is reflective of the wonderful hosts. The decor and layout is well thought out and cozy as can be when away from home. Hosts have thought of everything from cleaning supplies to even a spacious closet and laundry accommodations in the apartment. It is in a safe area and is in a great location to so many spots in Campbellsville and surrounding areas. I’ll definitely rebook when in town. Thank you for the hospitality!

We were visiting family in the area so we spent most of our time away from their home but if it we were looking to just get away it would have been the perfect spot to do so. They thought of everything. Had we wanted to prepare a meal, everything we would have needed would have been there. Did I mention how clean their home was? The neighborhood was quiet and serene, very peaceful. We’re looking forward to our next visit to Kentucky and I can assure you our next visit will be planned around Sharon and Jason’s home availability."

Amenities provided are excellent. It's close to the lake as well as eating areas, and close to the main street. Sharon and Jason were great at communicating and accomodating our stay with an earlier check in time and grace time to check out. If we decide to visit again, this will most certainly be a top choice. You will not be dissapointed."

I think the person that enjoyed it the most was my 3 year old daughter. Graceland is cozy, complete with washer and dryer + the king sized bed felt like sleeping on clouds.
I love the location because it’s close to Downtown Campbellsville. It was very convenient for the trip. Having a little back porch was great for sunrises and watching my child play with rocks.
Would definitely return to this location for my next trip."

The apartment is newly renovated with lovely decor and all kinds of thoughtful touches. It’s very clean and all the appliances are new, so it really feels like being at home. There are other apartments in the same block and 3 more blocks nearby so if you wish to be somewhere really secluded then this is not the place for you, but the neighbours didn’t bother us at all (no noise or anything). We loved seeing the deer out back in the mornings & evenings! We can wholeheartedly recommend staying here, and will definitely stay here again next time we’re in Campbellsville :-)"

Stayed one night","This place is absolutely stunning! All high-end finishes and completely spotless! Check in was a breeze. A simple text and a code gets you into the house. Once you’re in you have a fully furnished condo with a washer and dryer WITH laundry detergent, a full kitchen (including ALL cooking utensils) WITH a Keurig for morning coffee along WITH a variety of coffee to choose from, bottle water in the fridge, not to mention a variety of snacks! The TV’s, cable, Netflix, WiFi, etc., is all spot on! There is a nice big TV in the living room and a nice cozy spot to watch tv in the bedroom as well. Cable, Netflix, and WiFi is all provided. If you forget your toothpaste, deodorant, soap, etc., don’t worry, they got that covered too!!!! These guys do an excellent job at what they do and their condo is 100% gorgeous and most importantly to me, it was clean!!!!! I can’t say it enough. It was spotless clean! I’m on the road about three quarters of the year due to work and the night I stayed here was the closest I’ve felt to being in my own home in years! Lastly, I’ll mention that I am an OCD clean freak. This place was perfect! Thank you Sharon and Jason!
P.s. I forgot to mention, but the king size bed is really comfy as well!!! Job well done!"

Went into town one of the days, not much nightlife there so be prepared for that. I would say bring board games, books, and other things to occupy your time if you’re going to be there more than two days. Wish this cabin had a fire pit like the other one… would have been nice to sit by the fire in the evening."

My only disappointment and I knew this going in, so I really shouldn’t hold it against the house … the bed sizes. With such a beautiful home and so much going for it, having king beds would push this house over the top. The queens are okay, but I would not go back based on my addiction to having a roomy sleeping area. I’m not a supersized person, but do like to sprawl out and sleep better with some room. King beds and I go back and rate 10 stars!"

The cabin itself was clean and comfortable. Plenty of space for the 7 of us. Elam was also very understanding and accommodating and responded very quickly which was greatly appreciated. It was a super cute cabin and someplace that is definitely worth another trip when it is warmer so the area around the cabin can be enjoyed as well!

All smart TVs in every room were a hit with the kids! The WiFi reception was great in our experience. It’s very nice how every sleeping space is gorgeous— in other cabins there’s only one nice bedroom and the others are spartan. Not the case here. We had a very pleasant and easy experience renting this cabin from start to finish ❤️

We cooked in the kitchen and served 8 guest, made breakfast the following day and never wanted/needed something that wasn’t there. Everything went like a story book. The cabin in the woods was very clean, and was perfect for my family! Elam was extremely responsive and really made it an easy experience. I WILL RENT AGAIN. It was a few dollars more than my budget but once I arrived and seen the cabin I knew it was money well spent! 🤌🏼"

Stayed with kids","We really enjoyed our stay at this cabin! We have already booked it again for during the holidays! A couple of things I would have liked to know before I came
1. It's not as private as we thought. It is one of 4 cabins on the same stretch. You can see other people's cars and lights from their cabins when you go out. (Not a big deal, but I thought it was alone in the woods.)
2. The kitchen is Completely stocked! I had all the cookware I needed for all the baking I did, and I did alot! Also it had grill tools, and coffee, and paper towels, trash bags, laundry detergent, and really everything we needed to have a great stay!
3. The sewer did seem to have an issue everyday we were there, in that when we walked outside, there was a very strong sewer smell. This was not pleasant. Also the front door had the handle coming loose, and when we checked it, it was missing a screw. This was a safety concern for us, but I'm sure they'll fix it.
All in all, we were very happy with our stay!!!"

I have stayed at many airbnbs and most of the time you would have to buy/come with certain day to day items. She was also extremely responsive to all my messages and flexible with us in regards to check in/out. Would ABSOLUTELY stay here again when we come back to Kentucky. Thank you Kellen for everything!

My five year old was gifted chalk, crayons, a coloring book and a Disney bedtime storybook. by our gracious hosts. She was super excited about using them that she immediately went straight for them upon entering. The living room provided a good enough space for her to play, and the backyard was even better. The house was very accommodating, the kitchen was super organized, and the beds were so soft that it made sleeping in a little easier."

Stayed with kids","The furniture in the house is low quality; my pregnant friend fell from the sofa as its leg broke while she was sitting on it. The host seemed not worried at all when I told her about the accident at home, and didn’t even apologise for this serious accident. This home is remodelled only to make money out of it. Nobody has lived in this house as their own home, and therefore, it lacks the basic necessary items in home. When I asked the host about sugar, butter/ oil, dish cleaning sponge, etc., she asked me to buy from convenience stores. The listing said that the place has firewood, but she didn’t provide any until asked. When I asked for the lighter, she again turned me to the convenience store. We had to make multiple visits to convenience stores with a 4 month old baby. She also said that I’m needy and pointing out these things to take money from her. Overall, the host doesn’t care about the guests."

We saw deer and wild turkeys in yard, cooked on grill both nights, and enjoyed the large hot tub. Spent a day at Mammoth Cave, and time at Limestone Branch. Both are reasonable drives. Bring something warm for your feet as the floor is cold but clean. A couple of pods are provided for dishwasher, but none for washing machine so bring your own if you think you might use it. The kitchen and cook- and bakeware were in great shape and useful variety. We hope to return and definitely recommend this home."

Jt was always keeping us in the loop when needed and was always quick to get back with us.
We explored several areas in KY and the house was about an hour from Mammoth caves, Etown, and Bardstown. We went to red river gorge as well and that was about a 2 hour drive from the house too.
I cannot recommend this place enough and we will definitely be back!"

We have family that live locally in Campbellsville and Greensburg, and it was great to have our own space while visiting. All the appliances are new and there are more than enough kitchen supplies for cooking. The wifi worked great and the convenience of being able to log into our Disney+, Netflix, etc on the TVs was a huge plus with our kids. JT was wonderful with communication and we were able to come a day earlier than we planned with no issues. We highly recommend JT as a host while staying in Kentucky."

Stayed a few nights","When we got there, my family and I felt like we had stepped into an HGTV home!
Directions and Check-in with the lockbox were super easy!
The place was extremely clean and stocked with everything we needed for the two days.
I cooked four meals while there, and they had everything we needed to make it a success. The electric pellet grill was super easy to use for lunch and dinner.
The wifi worked perfectly with the home's 3 TVs, our three cell phones, and my husband's computer.
My daughter appreciated the bowl of snacks--she loved the cheez-its and cookies!
The animals in the back barn were too cute and a bonus to watch!
The hot tub was perfectly relaxing!
The location was perfect if you are trying to go to Green River Lake! We were minutes away from exploring nature, and the Civil War driving tour. Downtown has some super cute shops my daughter and I enjoyed. Plus, the architecture was beautiful to observe.
We did have one issue, but it was handled quickly. It gave us a chance to meet and talk with JT! Super nice guy! He even told us about the new house he was building next door, which was even bigger--another beautiful property that I cannot wait to check out if we travel with more people!
Overall, JT and his wife created a beautiful home with an awesome design of each room which had everything my family of three needed for a relaxing mini-getaway! Space to spread out, great blankets and pillows to get super cozy, a great kitchen for cooking, a wonderful hot tub, and a great location.
Cannot wait to come back!"

The check-in/check-out process was quick and easy. To say the farmhouse was immaculate is an understatement. They have thought of everything...great linens, comfortable bedding, well stocked kitchen (down to the snacks)...to make you feel right at home. While this trip was only my husband and I, this would be perfect place for a small family or two couples to enjoy the weekend. My only regret is that I can't rate it higher than five stars! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and hope to be able to visit this sweet place again in the future.

The barnhouse was just what we were looking for! It's rustic, private and the indoor decor is fabulous. We loved sitting on the back porch at night and listening to the symphony of bullfrogs and other critters. The porches are covered so even though it rained we were still able to be outside. The bed was very comfortable and the furniture just begs to be relaxed on. They have taken a lot of time to provide for a stay of any length and were a phone call away if there was something that we couldn't find or needed. I would definitely recommend a stay at the Barnhouse! Cherie and Tim are wonderful, caring and attentive hosts to commended on all that they do for their guests!!"

The bed was super comfortable, the bath was very relaxing and I loved that they included candles and bubble bath! They created the perfect stage for a peaceful and romantic getaway!
We felt the price was great for what they offered. When they say it’s only for A couple (two people) they were legit because it’s open concept to the max, which we loved!
Definitely follow their directions, someone mentioned that g-maps leads you astray and we confirmed that Apple Maps does as well. The phone maps will want you to turn sooner but be patient the road to turn on (492? I think) isn’t much farther up the road!
The hosts were super kind and responsive, once again, we couldn’t have asked for a better experience!! Highly recommend!"

One side note of you have sensitive feet wear swim shoes in shower. It’s a beautiful rock floor. The tub upstairs so relaxing. The bed absolutely the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. The quilts you snuggle with and the big comfy pillows. Took two naps while I was there. The huge bean bag is so comfortable to read in. Definitely worth every penny!! Cherie you were great Thank you!!

Stayed a few nights","ROMANTIC, RESTFUL GETAWAY!
We truly appreciated the thoughtfulness Tim&Cherie put into this property. It is obvious they thought through everything involved here! The location is just what we hoped for — on backroads and secluded. We had plenty of room outside; on the 3 covered areas; and plenty of restful spots within the cabin.
The kitchen had everything we needed to cook meals and snacks! Stocked with coffee as well. It’s rare to find an Airbnb with such well-stocked cooking supplies, utensils etc.
BEAUTIFUL woodworking, tiling, shower, tub etc. pictures do not serve it justice.
We also loved the touch of a Bluetooth speaker so we could subtly play music throughout our time.
Tim&Cheri, we’re very responsive hosts. Proactive as well. I felt so comfortable and welcomed by them.
This truly is a hidden gem!!
We loved it so much.. we already booked in Sept!!!"

We had some difficulty finding it at first, but Cherie was great, and even drove out to meet us by the main road so we could follow her back to the cabin. Our hosts went above and beyond to make sure that we had a comfortable stay. They even went out and purchased a toaster oven when the oven quit working.
The only thing I would want people to know is that the stairs are very steep in case mobility is an issue.
We will definitely be returning!"

The windstorm blew out power but with some candles and the indoor fireplace heater, we enjoyed the evening regardless and it made it more fun. It was no fault of the Airbnb. Power was out in several states.
Because we didn’t have power at first, we didn’t see/read the notebook so make sure to do that, useful info on all the crazy electrical switches."

It was beautiful to go out and walk around the property which we did in -9 degree weather on Christmas Day.

Once you get into the cabin, the WiFi password is actually the manufacturer's password that is etched into the side of the router. The instructions say something like underneath the black-tiered box, which was not 100% accurate. Other than that, be prepared for stillness and quiet. Very peaceful dwelling decorated with hunting gear and bourbon decor. As a bourbon enthusiast, I was right at home."

I would have used the kitchen if my stay was longer for sure because there’s not a ton of restaurants nearby, they do list what is though.

Stayed a few nights","Great stay! The barn house is so peaceful! Cell service is very spotty in the area so plan for that when you come. The home does have wifi but you quickly lose service the moment you go towards the end of the driveway. We jotted down directions when we were home so we made sure we weren’t driving lost. The stairs inside are steep! If you have trouble stepping up a good height, you will want to set up a bed on the lower level. Bring all the passwords to your different platforms for the tv. There is not Netflix or any service logged in for you. If you want to watch a show. The barn house is super cute and the shower is huge!!! Check in was very easy and with some navigation, food options aren’t too far away. The quiet was very welcomed from our normal noisy city life. As you get closer to the house the road changes to look like it is a one way. Don’t be fooled. They just didn’t put the line down the middle of the lane and it is very much a 2 way street. The hosts are very nice and the manual inside was very informative! The bed was also comfortable as well. Bring an eye mask if you want it super dark to sleep. There is a dim light left on al the time upstairs so you don’t fall down the stairs in an emergency. We will be back!"

Stayed a few nights","Nice quite neighborhood. The kitchen is beautiful except for the vent cover on the floor that falls into the hole if you step on it wrong. There are really no decorations to speak of; everything is very plain. Great for Minimalist. Hardwood floors. The art work is located in closets and not hung, these would help absorb the house noise. There are no rugs to absorb sounds in the house and so the house is very noisy. Door knob to one room doesn't work at keeping the doors shut, one door is very difficult to close. There is sparse cooking utensils (3 wooden spoons) bring a spatula, can opener and cork screw if you think you will need one. Bring nightlights if you get up at night. The grill is a VERY nice touch.
The house is easy to find with a nice drive. Most people would not be able to walk to the downtown shopping and restaurants from this house."

Stayed one night","For the money, this was the perfect place for my group. We were in town for a class reunion. The location was perfect! Very close to downtown where we went to eat and went to the Bourbon Boutique Bar. It’s also conveniently located to Swan’s Landing where the reunion took place. The back patio was great and there’s more than enough room inside to hang out. Thanks so much, Amanda, for the great hospitality!"

Group trip","We LOVED this place. Being originally from the area, our family has out grown staying with local family so this was a perfect size and location for us all from out of town. It seems like a recent remodel with new appliances and furniture , and maybe a few things are still in the works, but it was VERY clean and had everything we needed. The host messaged the day of arrival and said they were bringing by a grill and they did. A brand new gas grill. The pool table was great, too. Beds and pillows were comfortable and plenty of linens. The absolute only downside was with hardwood/vinyl flooring and with no throw rugs or area rugs every door open or close and step seemed to echo. And no kitchen or bath rugs. But compared to all the upsides, it wasn’t even that big of deal. Cleaning supplies were readily available for any spot cleaning we needed to do from our group. The huge back yard had several rabbits jumping through several times daily that were fun to watch. Really was a great place. Would definitely stay here again!"

The apartment is very quiet and peaceful , although we were out most of the time for a local conference we attended it was a perfect place to crash.

The stairs were wide and stable. The host prefers you park right next to those stairs. There is a very faint cigarette smell, most pronounced near the entrance, for people who are sensitive to such things. The hosts are easy to talk to if you approach them but will leave you alone otherwise. The little porch outside the apartment at the top of the stairs was charming. All in all, I enjoyed my stay and I highly recommend this place."

Stayed a few nights","Ronnie and Della’s space accommodates two people, possibly three if you set up an air mattress. There is plenty of space for parking. You walk up wooden stairs to a small deck area with two chairs where you enter your apartment. The key pad was easy to use. There is an AC unit that works well if it is warm. My husband and I opened the window in the bathroom and slept with the ceiling fan on one night and were comfortable. The bathroom was clean and spacious. It was nice having a refrigerator and freezer as I had brought snacks with me and things to heat up for breakfast. The yard is beautiful, although we didn’t have time to enjoy it. Della said hello to us one evening after dinner and she was very kind and welcoming.
The apartment is very close to the square where there is a great coffee shop that serves light breakfast and a cute bookstore. I definitely recommend Brothers Restaurant for great BBQ.
The only thing I would say is the pillows weren’t super comfortable, so be mindful of that and bring your own. Also, if you are sensitive to noise at night use a sound machine as you will hear cars and trucks driving by. But I slept just fine."

The downtown area is really cute, be sure to visit Harden coffee and Sweetwater bookshop. The last Druthers in KY is also located downtown. Multiple people told us the best food in town is the BBQ place but we didn't have a chance to try it. The airbnb was great, very quiet and clean. The perfect place to crash after a day of exploring.

Our Hosts went above and beyond to make us feel absolutely comfortable and at home. Gas grill available just outside. Full size refrigerator in the unit. Private parking spot. We were invited to enjoy their beautiful garden spaces, and even went for a tour with their Granddaughter via golf cart. Campbellsville is a beautiful area with everything a short walk or drive. Ask about our host’s favorite Mexican restaurant. It was fabulous!! Our Hosts, Ronnie & Della, made us feel like family! We had a major car repair during our trip, and they helped us to get to the repair shop and to the rental car business. We had an absolutely perfect time at this location. We cannot recommend this AirBnb highly enough!! Thank you, Della and Ronnie!!!"

Our stay started the day after Christmas there was a lighted tree which was a nice touch. I can not say enough nice things about our stay, hope to visit again in 2024."

Lots of space for a family, and we were very happy that our dog could join us on our trip as well. Katie is amazing and responds lighting fast. We loved the home so much that we are already considering another trip/stay in the summer."

Katie was very responsive throughout. When in Cambellsville we will definitely stay again and recommend to our family and friends who travel to the area.

Stayed one night","Anything I can say about this stay could never do justice to it. Not only is the house and it's history beyond beautiful and fascinating but the surroundings are just breathtaking. While we planned for a short stay and minimal time spent in the home itself, we immediately fell in love with the home and surrounding property. We enjoyed much of our time outside on the provided furnishings as well as picnicking under the larger trees and watching the neighboring livestock. The home itself was beautiful and incredibly well-stocked, making us feel right at home. We cannot wait to return to this stay and are already planning a trip back to Camblesville in the near future! Thanks again!!!"

The queen size bed was so comfortable and the shower was great. The kitchen with an extra large island was well equipped and provided the space to serve a family. Although we didn't get around to watching TV while we were there, it had a big screen. There's even a picnic table and BBQ grill to entertain outside. Beautiful quiet setting in the country. Highly recommend booking Vanessa's place if you get the chance!"

The location is beautiful - we enjoyed going for a long walk and trying to feed the cows next door. Also, there’s a state park just a couple miles down the road. I can’t say enough, we will definitely use this place again."

Our stay went nothing how we planned nor imagined but the house was perfect and just as it was supposed to be.

Group trip","The house was beautiful. It looked as beautiful as it did in the photos. When i had a question, it was answered in a timely manner. We all enjoyed the upstairs living room and pool table. All in all it was a great place for the family to come together and visit, much better than staying at a hotel."

Group trip","We enjoyed our stay very much. We were in town for a nearby wedding and the location was great with plenty of room for all eight of us. We enjoyed the pool table, the kitchen island to gather around to eat, drink, & socialize, & we enjoyed seeing the lightening bugs on the front porch. An added bonus was meeting Lee & Anne, the next door neighbors, who were extremely pleasant and even checked on us to see if we needed anything from the grocery store. True Southern hospitality. Thanks again for sharing your place with us."

We left with some wonderful memories with our family and friends. Staying here made this occasion even more special! Thank you, Mikayla!!"

Group trip",Upstairs AC was not working when we arrived. Someone came the next morning to look at it but did nothing. They said another contractor would come but that never happened. No updates were given after that. We had to sleep with the windows open for the entire trip which in turn was hard to sleep due to the traffic on the road in front of the house. The downstairs air worked but the majority of the bedrooms were upstairs.

Group trip","The house was clean, beds were comfortable, plenty of space for everyone. It was really nice having a 2 car garage. That was an added bonus we didn't expect. The keypad to lock and unlock the door was so convenient and it was nice to not have to keep up with a key. We really enjoyed our stay, wish it could have been longer. We will definitely plan stay there on our next visit to Kentucky."

Hosts were very easy to communicate with.

Stayed with kids",What a great place to stay! We stayed for the Fourth of July and were able to see all of the fireworks over the tree tops from the driveway. My kids loved playing with the neighbor kids and burning off all of their energy in the small field next to the Airbnb. Beware of the drainage ditch!!! My son took a tumble into it in the dark and we got lucky it wasn’t worse than it was. The Airbnb was perfectly spacious for my 11 month old to crawl around in and having Netflix already on the tv made entertaining her while I needed to get ready a breeze. Mom hack: I could fit a standard sized pack and play in the half bath off the left bedroom! I popped her baby monitor on the sink next to her and was able to give her a quiet place to sleep at night without having to tiptoe around. I would recommend this Airbnb to anyone needing a place to stay with small kids!!

Stayed a few nights","This is very accurate according to the description. They were great hosts who communicated quickly and helped us get checked in even though it was quite late, which we really appreciated! Our gps took us down the street so we had a minor issue finding the correct location :) they helped us with that which was great. The space is nice and clean, but one thing to note if you have allergies or asthma, it did have a strong musty odor (perhaps the previous tenant was a smoker). We opened the windows and that helped a little but still has a very strong musty smell. Not the biggest issue but for sensitive people it may be problematic."

Stayed with kids","Really enjoyed spending time with my daughter in their lovely abode. It was spacious enough for her to roam around, the beds were exquisite and made getting a good night’s rest even more enjoyable. The kitchen and living room being not too far from each other mean being able to see my daughter play while keeping an eye on the food. She really enjoyed the snacks the most. The house was very clean and they set very clear expectations for their guests. I will definitely be booking again for a return trip to Campbellsville."
