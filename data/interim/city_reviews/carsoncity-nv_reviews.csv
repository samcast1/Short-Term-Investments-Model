Stayed a few nights","We stayed two nights and wished we could have stayed longer! Right from the beginning when we entered the house and were greeted by Anthony, we loved our stay and found a second home away from home. Tiame and Anthony spoil their guests (free breakfast, beach chairs and towels, variety of soft drinks in the fridge...) and make sure they feel comfortable. And we did!
The room was cozy with a fridge, the bathroom is shared with two other rooms but was always super clean! The kitchen is fully stocked and I loved cooking our dinner while chatting with our hosts.
We for sure made two new friends and can recommend this place 100%."

Stayed one night","This was my first renting a room airbnb & last min reservation. I was super nervous I’m trying to budget since I will be commuting back and forth. Hotels in the area are extremely expensive. I don’t stay at motels but those were overpriced & looked pretty questionable.
The owners are amazing super friendly. Every time I had a question i received an immediate response from Taime. The room was super clean, mini fridge with beverages. A+ for having seltzer water. After working 12 hours feeling dehydrated that made my night. The room was comfortable, ceiling fan, extra blankets & towels provided in the closet. They have pretty much any movie app loaded for you to enjoy a movie or TV show.
When I left early in the morning the husband greeted me offered coffee & all the breakfast items they had to offer. I forgot my water cup & brought it out when I came back.
This was a great experience for. Only downside for me is sharing a bathroom with other guests. I’ll just buy Clorox spray!"

Stayed a few nights","Tiame and Anthony were SUPER hosts.
They made me feel very welcome and spent time just talking and feeling like friends I've known for a while.
They stock the kitchen with plenty of beverages, snacks, and breakfast foods.
The room was great and had a private refrige for my food. They also put sodas and health drinks in there for consumption.
I was visiting for 2 days for the Stetina's Gravel cycling race.
You'll also get to meet Dolly if you like - she is a super sweat doggo!"

Stayed a few nights","Staying with Tiame and Anthony was an absolute delight! From the moment I arrived, they welcomed me with open arms and made me feel right at home. Their house is not only impeccably clean but also conveniently located, making it easy to explore the area. The added touches like breakfast, a stocked mini fridge, and access to Netflix made my stay even more enjoyable. But what truly sets them apart is their genuine kindness and hospitality. Anthony went above and beyond by helping me with my car tires and even giving me a ride when I needed it. By the end of my stay, we had built a wonderful relationship, and I left feeling like I had gained new friends. Plus, their very friendly dog added an extra layer of warmth to the experience. They truly supply almost everything you would need, including a bathroom stocked with full amenities. Thank you, Tiame and Anthony, for an amazing experience!"

Clean bathroom, mini fridge inside the room with nice drinks, nice chat and breakfast. We just spent one night but this is the kind of place where you can stay longer. Our primary visit was MT rose ski resort so this place was really close, comfy and nice for us. I will definitely go back.
Thank you"

The Kitchen is equipped with whatever that’s needed as well as the plentiful breakfast options available. Thank you so much for the nice stay Tiame, we will miss this cosy space. Hope to visit again the next time."

We got a lot of breakfast amenities that we were also allowed to make free use of.
You do need to like a soft bed, the mattress was very soft.
All in all we had a super stay. Highly recommended!"

When I got to the house her husband greeted me with a smile and I saw their gorgeous dog Dolly who I fell in love with. I wanted to take her back to Vegas with me but I figured her mom and dad would probably give me a single star review for that!!! :) The house is beautiful, surroundings are gorgeous! Great place to stay and breathe some fresh air! Thank you both for a quick but very pleasant stay!"

Stayed a few nights",This is a quiet and nice place (with very reasonable price) that you can find in this area. The room was not super spacious but enough to stay for a few days. You will stay with two more guests at maxium and their rooms are close to each other so you may want to be more cautious of the sound or noise especially after the quiet time. Breakfast was well prepared and you will found tons of stores/restaurants in the Carson city. It will take ~30m to get to the South Lake Tahoe.

Walls are very thin, so be careful to be respectful of other guests and close the doors quietly. This was Tiame's only request, which I thought was completely reasonable.

Stayed over a week","Tiame and Anthony are absolutely wonderful hosts. I cannot say enough positive things about our stay. My husband and I came to hike the Tahoe Rim Trail and the location was perfect for access to Lake Tahoe and all the hiking trails. My husband did a lot of road cycling in the area as well. He also was able to work remotely from the room, and the wifi was great to support frequent zoom calls and cloud development.
Throughout our stay we always felt welcome, comfortable and safe. The rooms and kitchen were clean and even supplied with items for breakfast and coffee, above and beyond any AirBnB experience I’ve had previously. Lastly both Anthony and Tiame are just great people, always friendly and pleasant to chat with.
I would definitely stay here again when in the Tahoe/Reno/Carson area in future. 6 stars out of 5."

The only thing that I didn’t like was the other guests were not respectful of other people’s space. They were very loud in common areas, slam doors even if the hosts wrote a note “not to slam a door”. Most People are inconsiderate. Because of that I didn’t get a good sleep. But over all you get what you paid for."

The only thing challenging was having a busy shared bathroom with other guests. Even so, there were always plenty of fresh towels and anything else you might need. Definitely a great price and value for the area! We took a trip to Tahoe, and Fallen Leaf Lake and had dinner in Gardnerville at the JT Basque Restaurant (an experience!) all a short drive from there. I would stay at Taime's again!"

A lot of nice personal touches in this home and it shows that Scott and his wife care about their guests!
When I got there, I felt welcomed right away and it felt like home away from home!
No complaints from me. I was very satisfied with this airbnb and my host!
If you want quiet and peace and great views all around, this is the place!
Also, only a few blocks away you have restaurants and lots of shopping and fast food places!
Thank you Scott for being such a great host! I had a very nice stay!

Did not have to search for anything, everything made sense! Decor was tasteful and welcoming without being 'fussy'. Neighborhood is so safe, felt very comfortable walking around. It's located close to plenty of stores yet in a residential area keeping it low key and quiet. Communication with both Scott and Renee was excellent, immediate and warm. They also had the place ready for us early and welcomed an early arrival which was really helpful. Will come again!"

Stayed a few nights","Scott and Renee provided a great place to stay and visit Lake Tahoe, it only took 30 minutes to reach beautiful beaches from their Airbnb. We especially enjoyed walking along many beaches at Sand Harbor State Park where we rented a kayak and soaked in the beautiful views. The following day we took a scenic boat tour to Emerald Bay from the dock at Round Hill Resort. It was a 2 1/2 hour ride, enjoyed watching the parasailing above us and the surfer who was riding in the wake of the boat. We had visited Lake Tahoe a couple of times before but only saw the California side. This time we spent 3 days visiting the Nevada side and had a great time.
It was very convenient staying in Scott & Renee's home in Carson City. There are several shopping centers nearby, yet it is so peaceful at their location and very safe. This rental had everything we needed. The house seemed new, very clean, and well stocked. The setup was great and we had total privacy. We hope to return some day. Kudos to Scott & Renee!"

From their quick response and warm welcome, to the extremely comfortable living space—everything exceeded our expectations. They had everything we needed and more. Renee was even so kind to let our daughter play with some toys she had on hand. The location is a quiet, beautiful neighborhood, and the perfect place to end your long day as the sun sets behind the hills in the distance. Both my husband and I agreed that our Airbnb stay with Renee and Scott played a huge part in making our first visit to the Lake Tahoe area a wonderful memory. We would definitely stay here again."

Getting in and out of the house was very convenient and we were allowed to park right in front. The space was super clean and the perfect place to catch up on rest after our long hiking adventures each day. Would definitely stay there again!

Stayed a few nights","We stayed here for two nights on a quick weekend trip to Lake Tahoe, NV. Scott and Renee’s place here sets the bar for excellent and serves as a benchmark to compare others to. The unit itself was immediately comfortable the moment we entered. Clean, spacious, everything we needed and wanted for R&R between adventures. The neighborhood was quiet and wide open, we enjoyed a very pleasant walk to the park on the night we arrived. The proximity to groceries “and stuff” made stocking up our backpacks convenient on the way to trailheads, the lake, etc.
Scott and Renee are outstanding hosts and I will look for excuses to make the drive up their way again.
One local recommendation, Paul Schat’s Bakery. About 5min north, great place for an early breakfast. Family run, friendly local atmosphere."

If you are skiing at any of the resorts in CA, you will have a bit of a drive to get there, but the comfort and value of Scott's place cannot be beat when compared to places closer to the ski resorts.

Stayed a few nights","Scott and Renee were most gracious hosts and I look forward to staying at their guest suite the next time that I am in Carson City! The guest suite is a part of a NextGen design from the home builder; the guest suite is under the same roof as the main home, but you are completely and privately separated from the main house. You have your own private locked door to your suite. Parking was free, ample, and seemingly secure on the street in front of the house. Inside the suite, it was way more than I expected and a real value—so much more than a hotel room and at a lower cost. The suite was well-appointed and had modern appliances, tasteful decor, and comfy furniture (the bed has adjustable mattress firmness). The suite was clean and had all the amenities such as dishes, silverware, coffee, glasses, mugs, dish soap, big bath towels, shampoo, body soap, blankets, pillows, and the list goes on. The suite is readily accessible to both the 580 and 395, with supermarkets, restaurants, shops, trails, and parks within a 5-10 minute drive. Hwy 50 is also less than 5 minutes away, with a drive to Lake Tahoe taking less than 25 minutes from the suite (disclaimer: driving the speed limit, but at break of dawn before heavy traffic). All in all, if there were a category superior to “Superhost,” Scott and Renee definitely earn it! Many thanks for the great stay!"

Contactless check in was wonderful, especially during pandemic times. Walking in, you could see that everything was so clean and thoughtfully designed. I really enjoyed the color decor (cabinets, flooring, paint, plantation shutters...). It was all just beautiful. My hosts were so quick to help with any questions or concerns I had, and I felt so comfortable communicating with them. There's a community park within walking distance. I was also grateful to get my Raley's groceries delivered there - so nice when you don't want to leave the house. Grateful to have such wonderful AirBnb hosts! "

Stayed with a pet","Sharon was a great hosts. She accommodated our needs and that was really nice.
Nice and clean house in the residential area, little busy during the day time as in town, but very quiet at night.
There were only one bath towel in a bathroom so we took out from a closet but there were no hand towels and bath mat in a closet. We just used what they had.
Didn’t find a hair dryer but I had mine for just in case so that was fine.
Couldn’t find a trash can so we took our garbage.
We enjoyed quiet neighborhood. It’s right next to a coffee shop and that’s a given! Love to come back if we visit this area again."

We really liked having the bakery behind as well as the convenience store at the nearby gas station! It helped that the bakery closed at 4 since after that there were fewer cars. Curry street was very walkable and pretty! Sharon was very responsive to my requests. We really enjoyed our stay and would come back again!

Stayed one night","Sharon was extremely responsive to both my requests for extending the stay as well as getting in later than expected check in time. The place is updated with a clean interior and smooth lines throughout. Plenty of room for clothing and the desk in the second room by the window makes for an excellent space to work. The time around noon where LA bakery gets a little lunch rush can be hectic in terms of cars and people outside, but that’s a very minor inconvenience that is more than made up for by being so close to the bakery (everything is great there), the very zen backyard, and of course the clean updated interior. Would stay again!"

It’s about a 5 minute drive to downtown (incidentally, two thumbs up for meals at the Great Basin brewpub and Eve’s Cafe). The unit appears to be one half of a duplex but we never heard a peep from the other half - as a matter of fact it was very quiet all around."

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at Jody’s place was very good, and Jody was very communicative and accommodating with our late checkout request. The beds are among the most comfortable we’ve ever slept on! The appliances are all nice and new and the finishes made in the recent remodel are nice. Great washer and dryer unit and wonderful water pressure in the shower.
We were visiting during a record-setting heat wave, so it did get a little too hot for the portable AC unit to handle cooling the entire place. The location is very convenient to downtown and was prime for getting really anywhere in town. It should be noted that FISH, the local social services provider (food bank, dining room, thrift store, etc.), is within very close proximity so the transient and homeless population frequents this area of town. Overall, Jody’s place worked very well for the purpose of our visit which was to attend a special family event."

It was nice to have a garage to park your car and be secure. I cannot say enough positive things about the courtyard to the front door and it runs down the side of the home, and was PERFECT for my two dogs. Safe and secure, with a nice potty area. This place gets an A+ from an AKC dog show person (me). The place was SUPER clean, super comfortable. The shower was awesome with great water pressure. Everything is new and nice. Washer and Dryer inside, plenty of room, fully stocked kitchen, modern new matching appliances, beautiful refrigerator! The location of the rental was very convenient for downtown Carson City, quiet for the most part. Jody was easy to communicate with for making the reservation and for arriving with clear instructions. The locking mechanism for the front door is superior. Loved that! I highly recommend for dog owners to stay here."

Stayed about a week","Very comfortable duplex unit in North Carson with easy access to highways headed to Reno, Tahoe, Virginia City. We loved the great communication with Jody, the great kitchen with sharp knives and nice, new everything, fresh shower enclosure with a great shower head and comfortable bed. Surprisingly quiet for a working class neighborhood with some commerce nearby. Garage parking was a nice surprise, and the cute private patio gets lovely morning sun. Jody was quick and super friendly in her responses to our many messages; she made it easy to extend our stay twice! A no-brainer for a great value if you're traveling in the Carson City, Reno, or Tahoe area"

For travelers with a dog, this stay is ideal. There is a fully, securely fenced yard accessible from both the front door and a door in the back bedroom. Being able to let the dog wander through the open doors while we cooked was great. My dog had been stressed in other accommodations and he really calmed down here.
Jody was a great communicator. Highly recommended!"

Stayed with kids","Kenneth greeted our family upon arrival, instructing us to park in the secured garage. He helped carry luggage upstairs, gave us a tour of the beautiful suite, explained how to use the security door (of the suite), lights, and most importantly, the jacuzzi which we used every night. We requested for the thermostat to be adjusted to 75F while the outside temperature dropped down to 25F at night and around low 40's during the day. He responded to all my messages throughout our 4nite stay. The sunrises and sunsets were stunning. There is large deck where it was cool to see rabbits running through neighboring properties and see horses kept as pets. New Years was very peaceful during midnight. Many restaurants, grocery stores, and shopping places are conveniently located within 10 minutes away. We took our kids to Mt. Rose to snowboard one day and then to Sand Harbor Beach another day. His property felt very safe. I highly recommend staying at Kenneth's beautiful suite."

Both nights I was woken by people in the house who were up and active in the middle of the night. Noises really carry in the house. It should be noted that I am a light sleeper, and no one was being too obnoxious. Other than that everything was great, and the house was empty and quiet during our waking hours."

Kenneth has a lovely home nestled in the snow dusted foothills of Nevada. He is a wonderful host, checks in, communicates well, and makes sure you get in safe. I would happily book again. As a matter of fact, we even asked if we could book another night! Also, the price point was perfect; absolute great value.

He was very nice, accommodating and friendly. Even let us park in the garage! Super cool!
Offered help w/bags, and was at the door to greet us when we showed up.
Told us if we needed anything to let him know, very professional, yet friendly. I would highly recommend.
The views of the surroundings are beautiful, it’s quiet, safe neighborhood.
Heated queen bed, soft comfy futon bed as extra bed or just use as couch. Very nicely decorated.
Pictures matched accommodation.
Definitely will stay again, and highly recommended. 😁👍"

It's about 20 miles from South Lake Tahoe, about 30 minutes drive which is no big deal, and avoids the high-price areas, so we stayed two nights instead of one.
Totally enjoyable, great host, and would definitely stay there again!

Stayed a few nights","If you are looking to travel to Lake Tahoe or Carson City, this is THE PLACE TO STAY!! If you are skiing at the resort, it is only a 30-40 minute drive in normal conditions and is worth every minute and mile. Below is a review categorized by room:
Let’s start with the large and spacious bedroom. It is outfitted and decorated perfectly. A matching queen bed and futon can fit four people in this room with plenty of space. The table near a triple window, which overlooks the mountains, seats everyone well. Ken has dishes and high quality silverware prepared for you when you arrive! The TV seems to be either very high quality 1080p or it is a 4K. We watched a Marvel movie on it and we’re very impressed. The sound bar provides great sound quality. There are multiple apps accessible for viewing a wide variety of tv shows and movies.
The bathroom. THIS is what I booked this place for when viewing various places. The HOT TUB!! It is a high quality tub which seats two people in a lounge style which has jets for the back and feet, as well as others to circulate. The shower has ample space inside, a dual shower head style: one part which pours a rain-style or waterfall, then a hand-held secondary spray head that can share the water to really get everywhere with ease. There is a dial that controls temperature and it is displayed digitally. For the shower are quality shampoo, conditioner and body wash. Next are two sinks with plenty of countertop space for everyone and a full length mirror. Provided are hand soap and hand lotion. There is even a towel just for makeup! The toilet has its own private room as well.
The linen closet is located in the bathroom and houses a Galanz mini-fridge with freezer, microwave, Keurig coffee maker with coffee pods available and creamer, bath robes and a spare, extra warm blanket!
Downstairs there is a spacious kitchen available for meal prepping. Put back there is a patio that has a wide open landscape view of long fields and the mountains, which are covered in snow in the winter. We found the perfect spot below the deck to the right for quality photos to be taken with these white topped mountains as a backdrop.
The garage was made available for use for us, which was very important during cold frosty nights.
Overall, if I could give more than 10/10 I would!! You can’t beat this place for the price offered! Ken will answer every question and work with you to accommodate your needs during your stay. We will definitely be returning customers!!!"

Stayed a few nights","This is one of the largest rooms I ever stayed. I spent 2 relaxing nights in a hot tub, I booked because of hot tub, but the room and bathroom impressed me as well! Its 800 sq feet, very nicely decorated. The bed is comfy, loved pillows, they are not huge stuffed like balloons. Bedding is good quality, soft. Ken has Kirkland coffee pods and creamer for the morning, he has a goodie basket with chocolates, crackers and chips. Every detail is thought through and you have anything you need. Very relaxing ! One small detail for anyone sensitive. I had to wear earplugs because the circulation of air (like in hotels) hissing noise, but I am very sensitive to this, most would not even hear it! Ken is very friendly and kind, the house is huge and I believe it is the best deal in Carson City among airbnb and hotel rooms. Will be back!"

Stayed about a week","Another great stay at Spare Cottages! This was my second time at my Home-away-from-home, and since I was traveling solo, the Bear Cottage was the perfect spot. Kathleen is very creative, and her rentals have so much character. Bear Cottage is cozy, with an electric fireplace, waterfalls, and lots of adorable bear decor. Visits to Spare Cottages are always a unique experience with surprise features. I bought a bongo drum after playing with musical instruments in this cottage. There was a fully-equipped kitchen and a second bedroom/office. Betsy's Restaurant in Slot World Casino is just a couple minutes walk, and they have great food at amazing prices. Lake Tahoe is an easy drive, and stores are nearby. The neighborhood is peaceful, and the cottage has a private back yard. The Serenity hot tub area looks absolutely beautiful. I look forward to staying at the other two rentals on site to check out their ambience."

Stayed a few nights","The cottage was super comfortable, even larger and nicer than it appears in the photos. We slept great. Loved the coffee station. There are 3 tvs with streaming, which kept our teen occupied when he had downtime. The area has plenty of stores, and quick access to the highway made getting to the beaches only 30 min. We used Kathleen's kayaks for 3 days, which she rents for a reasonable price along with other items. We were 1st-timers, so it was fun to explore Tahoe's shores from the water. We were able to find our own ""private"" mini beach at Zephyr Cove by exploring in the kayaks. I would have tried the SUP if we had more time. Overall great stay. We'd love to come back and highly recommend it!"

Stayed a few nights","I have found my Home away from home! The stunning Lake Tahoe decor in the larger unit made me feel like I was living in the mountains again. This 2-bedroom unit has everything a family can possibly need - washer/dryer and fully equipped kitchen. I relaxed in the private back yard, with a BBQ grill, patio tables and colorful lights. Kathleen also gave me a tour of the absolutely adorable Bear cottage. This smaller unit is perfect for a couples getaway, with more than 100 bear decorations. There is also a studio unit for rent. I plan on soaking in the outdoor hot tub on my next visit. Kathleen is the Ultimate host. I arrived early from a long, hot drive with no air-conditioning, and Kathleen arranged for early check-in. She is very friendly and helpful, and there's tourist information in the unit to enhance your stay. There's a casino and restaurant within walking distance. Spare Cottages are perfect for family reunions, so much more cozy than hotels. I highly recommend these rentals."

The kitchen is equipped with just about anything you could want or need to prepare your drinks and food during your stay. While the linens and covers were clean, unfortunately the beds were not comfortable and the frame of one bed (first bedroom to the left) was extremely unstable. The mattresses on all three beds seem to be worn and are extremely soft. None were suitable for someone with back problems that needs a firmer bed."

Group trip","Jody was a phenomenal host and was very accommodating when questions arose prior to our trip. Upon arrival we had set up a 2pm check-in, but arrived a lot earlier then expected and she allowed earlier check-in as the houses were already cleaned and ready to go for us. The next day did have some questions locating a couple items and she quickly responded.
One of the highlights to this location was it’s a pet friendly house so we were able to bring one of our youth member’s puppies with us to enjoy the snow. Everything was perfect in the house and the location was great. Everything you need is within driving distance and a little further puts you in Tahoe. Would we stay here again?....YES!"

No sooner would I send a message, I would have a response within five minutes. The property is described perfectly in the listing. Each room has its own theme, and I love the window coverings. The privacy is great if you do not need open windows.
I recommend this property if you want a fun and unique getaway. The combination of the property and Kathleen certainly gives you an escape."

The lighting sets the tone for the relaxing experience that will absolutely blow you away! And Kathleen is as good as advertised. Superhost! The cottage was clean and comfortable. She responded when needed and even had some snacks for us. Much appreciated. Thank you Kathleen for an amazing stay. We look forward to our next visit soon!!!

Bathroom was loaded with towels, shower supplies, and some really nice little details like tissues and toilet spray. The beds were comfy, the lighting in the master bedroom was SO ambient and the chairs/lighting were perfect for breastfeeding at night without waking up my husband. The hot tub was warm, relaxing, and so luxurious. There were too many sweet and thoughtful personal touches to list. Kathleen has truly thought of everything and was a very accommodating host."

I was in cottage #2 which was pet friendly and squeaky clean. I appreciated the washer and dryer which were very handy and easy to use. The dishes, pots and pans and the silverware are not only efficient but absolutely beautiful. Easy to clean. The full size frig was great. The three TVs would be great for a family or even two guests to watch what they want. parking was inside the fencing which felt very secure. Loved it. Kathleen has put a lot of thought and care into her places and it shows. The privacy of the entire grounds is superb. I would definitely stay again and again and again. Thank you so much Kathleen. Good luck and God Bless you."

The bed was especially comfortable and I slept very well. I loved the old victorian neighborhood and historical markers and the proximity to the Carson City museums, government buildings, and walkable downtown with restaurants and art galleries.

Stayed over a week","We loved our stay at Chelsea and Rafael’s comfortable house. It was very clean and the rooms were spacious and nice. They were quick to answer any of our questions and requests. I grew up in Carson City and was visiting family and they came over frequently. Chelsea and Rafael really gave the feeling that this was our home for the time we were there. They even encouraged us to eat their peaches in the yard and I made several desserts with them. So even though they live in the separate mother-in-law section, we hardly ever saw them and my family members felt at home. In addition, the neighborhood is in the desirable west side of Carson City."

There was plenty of space for all of us. The owners communicate quickly if any questions arise. Only con we had was the house is on a raised foundation making the floors incredibly noisy when walking on them but it was only a problem because we had an infant with us who is touchy to noise. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone.

Stayed with kids","I was a little hesitant to book this one at first because of the review before me, but I'm so glad I ignored it! The house was spotless, the check-in was incredibly easy, and it was a perfect place for our group of 4 adults and a dog to hang out in the large family room and outdoor patio with great views. Most importantly, we didn't really realize what a great location it really is. We walked to the Nevada Day festivities 2-3 times each day, including the parade, balloon take-off, etc, but got to come back to a true residential home in between activities. The fall leaves were in full swing, and deer walked down the street every day we were there, so it was an unexpected autumn paradise. We had planned to do at least a day at the beach in Tahoe...but never made it because we basically fell in love with this part of Carson City!"

They only refunded $150... They seem like an awesome couple, just very unorganized."

Much more low-key than Reno which is what we wanted, but was close enough (30 min) to be able to go check out the downtown Reno area. Tiame and Anthony were so friendly and went above and beyond to make us feel right at home. They offered us breakfast and even offered for us to make a lunch before we left so we didn’t have to stop on the road. They gave local dining and recreational recommendations. Talking with them and the other guests was so enjoyable. Sharing the space was not a problem as they go out of their way to be accommodating for their guests. Would definitely return!"

I truly felt like home when I stayed at Tiame’s. Everything including my late check in accommodation, assistance with my car charging situation and all the way to accepting my late check out to be able to take my work calls before heading out, was just amazing.
One thing to keep in mind for EV owners is that might be hard to find Supercharger near Carson city area. There are few EV chargers but you would need to leave the car overnight or at least 10-11 hrs for full charge.
The host was nice enough to even give me a ride to a station close by to leave the car for the day and the same for car pickup. This worked out well for me but if you are in a hurry, I highly recommend to charge your on the way or check out the closes supercharge stations"

They just don’t want you waking them or other guests up by slamming doors which to me just makes sense. They are reasonable and if you accidentally shut your door to hard they aren’t going to freak out. Just be respectful."

Stayed one night","I had to think about how I was going to word this review.
Pros: Tiame thought about the small details which are important and really matter such as providing snacks, refreshments, a first aid kit, all shower necessities, plenty of extra towels and linens, and laundry facilities in case you need to do laundry yourself.
Cons: the rules being explained in what felt to be an unnecessary way. Like for every door slam it's a $10 fee. There was a note on the back of room door that said if you can hear the door shut than that counts as a slam. So basically my girlfriend and I moved around the house as little as possible to try to make as little noise as possible. We did not feel comfortable at all and was extremely happy we were only there for like 10 Hrs. The comforter had a couple stains on it and the bathroom wasn't horrible but not great. All 3 rooms were rented the night we stayed and sharing a bathroom with the other guests was slightly inconvenient like a race. lol Would not return."

The house is very clean and you will find everything you need and if something is missing, Tiame and Anthony are totally attentive and very helpful. The kitchen is equipped with everything you can imagine. We were allowed to serve everything and always enjoyed a great breakfast.
The bed was also very comfortable and even in the bedroom there was a small fridge with cold drinks as well as other water bottles in the closet. We lacked nothing and we would have liked to have stayed a few days longer. Really great!

Stayed one night","I highly recommend Tiame's place for both short or long term (depending on the availability). Her place is an ideal location in Carson City. All the stores and restaurants are close by (driving distance) and the view is magnificent! The house itself is relatively new and clean! Both hosts (the wife and husband) are very nice and warm. Upon meeting new people, I always feel awkwardness because of my disability as a Deaf individual and oftentimes the awkwardness does not go away till the next following day or so, but for these people the awkwardness quickly diminished within few minutes as if they were familiar faces. You will love them, their house, and the location. The price is very reasonable. They provide high end (good brand name) beverages, snacks, candies, and personal hygiene's such as shampoo, conditioner, body wash, etc. Communication is at best with them. You will not be disappointed! I highly recommend you to choose Tiame's place. Like the old saying, ""there is nothing like home"" - this is exactly what Tiame's home does make me feel like when I stayed with them."

We stayed there for the Celebrity Golf Tournament and stayed 6 nights. The room and bed is comfy. The bedroom includes a mini fridge stocked with water, soda, and flavored water, which we could restock from the supply in the garage. They also had a bottle of wine and bowl of chocolates in the bedroom. The bath is shared, but it has double sinks and we didn't have much of an issue bumping into the other guests. They gave us access to breakfast items in the kitchen, which included Keurig coffee pods, fruit, a variety of cereal, and various mini pastries. The home was very quiet and we only saw the hosts twice during our stay. Carson City also has many good restaurants downtown. Highly recommended place!"

Stayed a few nights","Tiame and her husband are very welcoming and have created a comfortable, clean environment for their guests. The neighborhood is brand new and is conveniently located near stores, restaurants, and downtown Carson City. The rooms are very nice and have a stocked mini-fridge. Guests have access to the kitchen and a full spread of breakfast items along with coffee and tea. The bathroom is shared amongst the 3 guestrooms. The common areas were all kept clean during our stay."

Stayed about a week","The house was clean, well-equipped, and in a great location! I do a lot of video conferencing for work and the WiFi was blazing fast. The king-sized bed in the primary bedroom was very comfortable. The house needs a little TLC, but we appreciated the access to the trails and the use of the garage for our bikes. It was a the quick ride to downtown, and the neighborhood was quiet."

Stayed a few nights","OUTSTANDING AIRBNB! We've stayed at Airbnbs all over the world, and quite honestly, Lailah's place is right up there at the top of our list! Her place had everything we were looking for--perfect size with 3 bedrooms, ample space for relaxing, a full size kitchen, and an absolutely perfect location. We spent 5 nights at Lailah's place in Carson City while doing some skiing at Mt Rose (30 minutes), Heavenly (35 minutes) and Kirkwood (one hour), plus visiting friends in the local area. The neighborhood is great and there is a grocery store within walking distance or just a very short drive away. The wifi worked great for our young adult children (5 stars from them!) and the tv in the living room provided a much needed relaxation zone for the evenings. We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay in the Reno/Carson City/Lake Tahoe area! We'll definitely be back and we look forward to our next stay at Lailah's house! We definitely wouldn't stay anywhere else!"

Group trip","We stayed in Carson city because it was close to Lake Tahoe and only a 25 minute drive. The drive was easy and worth it! The home looks just like the photos and even better in person!
Location: The home itself is in a very quiet, nice and respectful neighborhood. It was easy to find and clear instructions for entry. There are plenty of places to eat in less than 10 minute driving distance.
Kitchen: The home had all toiletries and cleaning supplies along with available coffee and powdered cream and sugar. There was plenty of pots and pans for any cooking and baking. There was also plenty of seasonings.
Amenities: The house had a heater which was perfect for winter time. The bathroom seats were all heated and the master bathroom has jets in the tub which we did not use but worked perfectly fine! The backyard is not private but absolutely peaceful and relaxing!
Entrance: Getting access to the house was very easy and plenty of space in the driveway.
Overall I’d highly recommend!"
