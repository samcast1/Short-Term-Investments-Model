Stayed one night",I didn't stay in the place one night. The bed was a 40-year-old bed with springs coming through it. The couch was a ripped up mess. I wouldn't let my dog sleep on that bed. Immediately left and found a motel room and Ashton is trying to charge me $140 for a room that I had to cancel and never stayed in what a rip off!!

Stayed one night","I read the reviews several times and feel that it needs to be said, the bed is incredibly squeaky with a very old dirty foam pad on top of it. The a/c vent is extremely rusty, there is no fixture over the bedroom light bulb and the cushions on the couch have a huge tear down the back of them covered by a blanket. The neighbors were loud most of the night causing us to wake up several times."

The only real downside is that there is no washer/dryer in unit. However, there's a laundromat nearby and they'll even let you drop off your clothes, wash and dry them, and you pick them up later. No dishwasher, but it takes no time to hand clean dishes. All in all it's a great place, and Ashton is wonderful host- always responsive and helpful. I recommend this stay to anyone!"

Ashton really did a great job decorating the place and it was very clean. Bonus:Pet Friendly! There is a small and private backyard with privacy fencing all the way around. If you have small pets though- one side has a gap they could escape from. It’s about 50 minutes North of New Orleans and very centrally located to the North Shore towns of Covington, Mandeville and Slidell. Ashton was courteous, and prompt with any needs we had. You can’t go wrong renting this little place!"

Stayed a few nights","I want to start off by saying Ashton was a great hostess. We got off to a rocky start because she experienced problems with the plumbing in the unit we had rented. This could not have been handled any better than she did. She immediately called us which we were about an hour away and let us know what our options were. She was not only dealing with this but other extenuating circumstances. Luckily, she was able to move us to another unit which is not always an option with AirBnb. Then she managed to have it ready on time. Not many people can pull that off. The apartment was adorable with all sweet touches of home. I felt like I was staying at home. We had some popcorn she left for us and had an amazing time due to our amazing host."

Stayed one night","Overall it was what I expected. Cozy, plenty of space, kitchen was very well-equipped (only missing a toaster that I could see), smelled clean. Communication was quick enough when a problem came up. Hostess respected my desire for privacy and the lockbox allowed me to arrive and depart like I owned the place and I never once had to even see or meet the hostess. Great location and everything I wanted to visit and see was well within a reasonable distance.
Now, the most critical thing I can say is the advertised price that drew me was $51 a night. The final purchase revealed additional fees that doubled the overall cost. $30 cleaning fee, $10.49 service fee, and $7.32 for occupancy taxes and fees added to the original $51 came out to over $99 a night. A decent hotel room stay is around $90 but you don’t have the feeling of a comfortable home or quite the same privacy and sense of security."

Stayed about a week","Cozy small home away from home. The host had several personal touches to the house than made it feel very comfortable. I would give the house five stars however, the bed was advertised as a queen but it's actually a full size which was shocking to see no one mention in the reviews. The only other down fall of the house was the WiFi (would take multiple tries and about 30 seconds to load just my email on my phone). The home could not have WiFi and it wouldn't have made a difference. But, these two things wouldn't make me not recommend this lovely home just something to keep in mind if you particularly have to have a queen size bed or WiFi during your stay. Overall the host provided all necessities and made us feel very welcomed."

There was a small scented candle in the bedroom. In the kitchen and in the bathroom there were small night lights, if one was traveling as a nocturnal. Everything was super clean. Also the interior of the house was high quality. everywhere were small messages distributed with explanations. we felt very comfortable. unfortunately we only stayed for one day. I can highly recommend the accommodation. ashton thanks for everything <3"

Stores were only a 10 minute drive away, but the place was in a very peaceful area where we could sleep without loudness of the city. The drive to New Orleans wasn't too far, but far enough to get away from all of the craziness even during Marti Gras. The only thing I could say is that the wifi wasn't very strong but 5 different electronics were trying to connect at once which may have been partly on us. 😂 Really we had a great time on our vacation and Ashton was very helpful and I would certainly stay there again."

If you try to imagine a true farmhouse this would be it, from the rustic look of the home itself to the authentic furniture and spacious fully loaded kitchen. You could hardly want for anything as the house is appointed with EVERYTHING one could need. My hard to please 15 yr old daughter and video game addicted son were upset about only one thing...leaving. The horses and chickens and cats and dogs added even more to a wonderful stay. I can honestly say we have not one complaint. We met our host personally and she was wonderful. She definitely deserves the title of ""Super Host."" I would recommend this place to everyone, young or old. We will be back again for certain."

It is furnished like an old southern country home. The decorations, furnishings and location were a perfect mix. We are both products of living on a farm in our childhood. This house and ranch were a step back in time for both of us. We sat on the covered front porch and watched a rainstorm, with Mel, the friendly cat. For the first two days it appeared that Mel was a statue, but on the third he moved. The pets were friendly and not bothersome. The area is interesting and loaded with things to do. We went into Biloxi and visited several casinos, which we love to do. This area is very scenic with lots of trees and rivers as well as beautiful white sands on the beach 30 to 40 miles away. We hope to go again and take the kids and grandkids.

She went out of her way to add special touches, like candy dishes, flowers, and assorted snacks. Everything you could have possibly needed or wanted was supplied and more so. She lived next door but was very considerate of our privacy. We loved talking to her each morning as she fed the animals. This will be our go to place everytime we come to Mississippi to visit our granddaughter. What a beautiful, peaceful, authentic, and unique home. It has been well maintained, great water pressure for showers and luxury big towels, along with accessories. She used good quality brand name toilet paper, paper towels, shampoo, coffee. Bottled water was even provided. I could go on and on about how amazing this farmhouse and hostess was. A big personal thank you to Lavonne."

Stayed with kids","Lavonne's Chickies Cottage was awesome. Lavonne is a great host and treated us as her guests. The place was as described and we were welcomed by two very friendly Australian shepherd as we drove in. Lavonne came by to make sure everything was set to our preference. The cottage was decorated tastefully and had rusty, farm character. Given it was Christmas, she also had a decorated Christmas tree which our son was going to miss otherwise. My 10 year old son and wife had a great time spending time with the farm animals. They would go out early in the cold morning to feed the horses. My son was super excited when Lavonne offered to take him on the ATV to feed the cattle. The cottage had bunch of board games which my son and I played everyday evening. When we asked about checkout process, Lavonne responded with don't worry about anything and just have good time and that she will take care of everything. Overall it was a great experience and would not hesitate to recommend to anybody."

Chickie's Cottage was very welcoming, comfortable, and had everything we needed. Watching the fog roll in at night and the mist lift up in the morning from the porch and the big kitchen window was such a simple joy. The dogs came by to say hi! and the cats did, too. Sable (the grey cat) sought out our daughter and hung out with her, and even gave our dog a welcoming headbutt. Lavonne very kindly gave our daughter permission to feed the horses and provided her with carrots. I think that (and the kitties) was the highlight of this trip and an experience she will definitely remember forever. We will definitely be back and hope to stay longer next time."

Our children adored all the animals, and the homey antique furnishings gave this place a true sense of history. I'd visit again just to walk on that amazing wide plank rustic wood floor!
Something we were happy to discovery (and why we chose this location), is, that it is easy to get a low EMF reading by disconnecting wifi and connecting to ethernet (my husband is super tech-y) ;)--We were able to get the EMF reading down to 98! Wow. Nice! Wonderful deep sleep. Cell towers are miles away, though you are still able to pick up a few bars for necessary phone calls. Ethernet was more reliable for us.
It was a little chilly with the heater off at night (our preference), but Lavonne provided plenty of blankets which worked great for us. If you prefer a higher-tech experience just keep the heater and the wifi on!"

Comfortable, cozy and gives you the feeling of being at home. Lavonne is a super host, lots of special things left to make us feel at home and she is super quick to respond to any questions you have. I would definitely recommend her place. If you love the country or want to know what it is like to enjoy country living this is the place. The horses, dogs, cats and chickens are all so sweet and love being loved!"

Friendly dogs, chicken and hummingbirds would visit us as we watched the sunset. Such a nice, quiet and peaceful place, run by Lavonne, which is a very attentive host. One of the few places I can confidently recommend.
Lavonne spricht übrigens sehr gut Deutsch!"

First morning we had a slow wake up; daughter and I sat outside on the porch and soaked up the morning sun, listened to the birds. The place is SPACIOUS and very clean. Soaking tub with complementary bath bombs, walk in shower with glass doors, coffee nook with complementary snacks, beds were comfortable, spacious kitchen for cooking, open floor plan. We cooked NY strip/chicken and watched the huge television with digital streaming in the evenings. Thermostat cools nicely. Appliances are top notch, including washer and dryer. Hosts very attentive, gave suggestions for local dining, asked to ensure our stay was going well. Dollar store 1.5 miles away, super Walmart 3 miles away but still seems so very rural. Nice to come back to after walking the French quarter all day. Would def stay here again!!"

Shes extremely helpful, caring, and values you as a guest. She responds always very quickly and is so kind. Her flexibility letting us check in the night before last minute was so much appreciated. The home is always clean and comfy. The bed is comfy too which is so important of course! The location couldnt be better. Plus she allows my fur child whom we always travel with and he has a fenced in back yard. We are so thankful for this airbnb in an area with hardly any so we can have our own place to stay when visiting family."

Stayed a few nights","Kristy’s place is charming, spacious, comfortable, immaculately clean, and quiet. It was the perfect stay for two of us and our dog while we visited family in nearby Slidell, LA. We enjoyed having such a nice full-size, well-equipped eat-in kitchen. There was plenty of room for us to spread out and for me to work remotely during our stay without interruption. My work involves a lot of online work and video calls. The WIFI connection supported that work perfectly. The furnishings and artwork are lovely, but not pretentious. We felt very much at home. We made the easy 45 min drive into New Orleans twice. Kristy was a very responsive host. I will miss walking across the street to Betty K’s diner each morning for a sausage biscuit and a glimpse into local life. The fact we were sad to leave says volumes about our stay. We hope to make a return visit."

We had everything we needed and more. This is an older home but updated with remote lights and phone chargers, extra towels and wash cloths. It was decorated so cute.

Stayed a few nights","We really enjoyed staying at Kristy’s place in Picayune. The home is beautifully decorated and was conveniently located just 50 minutes from New Orleans, which was where we spent one of our days. The house was well stocked with everything we needed. The bed was very comfortable and the sheets smelled so good! Plenty of towels and washcloths, toilet paper and even flushable wipes.
We are a family of four with 2 teenage girls. The futon was actually very comfortable for them and they had enough room on it. They also really like the wireless phone chargers.
The kitchen was stocked with some nice amenities: microwave popcorn, Keurig with a nice selection of pods, water flavoring packets, and even some nice wine.
A few tips: The shower water was hooked up backwards (red is actually cold). Also, be careful with the auto lock on the front door. It would be real easy to get locked out without the key if you went outside for a few minutes or to get something out of the car.
Kristy was a great host and was quick to respond to any messages. Highly recommended!!"

The driveway was nice so as not to have to park on the street. On the inside: everything was very clean! There is a good sized bathroom area, a nice sized kitchen, washer and dryer, and the bed...

One recommendation would be to put a grab bar on the side of the shower for safe in and out or a non-slip feature on the bottom of the tub. The side is a bit high and almost fell when getting out.

There were a few people nearby who were riding their bikes but that didn't really bother us. We could eat out in close proximity and also a good supermarket was not far away.

Marvin was beyond helpful and accommodating, we found the place easily, and we're immediately at peace as soon as we hit the driveway. It is like driving into a paradise! We never ran out of things to do on the property. The kids had plenty to do without screens and we enjoyed hiking, canoeing, and seeing the wildlife the most. We got to see a gator in the front pond on our last night and had fun identifying all the animal tracks (hogs, coyotes, armadillo, racoon, etc) on the trails. The trails are well kept and the dock has the most beautiful view. The house is spacious and well stocked for cooking. Picayune had several great restaurants to enjoy and we drove into Louisiana for one day, but you don't have to leave the property to have a great time. We would love to come back again one day and try the birdhouse, too. Thanks again for a memorable vacation with our kids!"

Group trip","The loghouse at Bolo Creek Cabins is a great property! We really appreciated Marvin meeting us and showing us around and explaining the history of the property. The information he gave and the stories he shared were very helpful. The cabin is beautiful. The furniture is very comfortable with plenty of room for a group. The kitchen is very well stocked, and all of the beds were super comfortable. Having a screen porch was awesome for the night it rained, and the view of the creek from the deck is gorgeous and so peaceful. 
The cabin also had several board games and puzzles for guests, and downstairs was equipped with ping pong, ladder toss, horseshoes, and giant connect four! There is a picnic table and camp chairs downstairs. And the property is huge! We went and explored all of the hiking trails, and the hand painted signs marking each trail were cute and helpful.
We can’t recommend this property enough, and can’t wait to go back and visit again. "

Stayed with kids","Staying at this cabin was a great long weekend getaway for our family. I have four kids and they all loved coming here. There wasn’t a tv but there was more than enough to keep them occupied. They loved going fishing, like twice a day for all the days we were there. My 5 year old caught her first fish ever! The kids played ping pong and all the games that were in the house.
We wanted the opportunity to get away and reconnect as a family away from electronics so we already planned on no phones for the weekend and this house and the property provided the perfect space to do that. The beds were comfy and clean.
Marvin gave us a personal tour of the house and provided a map of the property. We will definitely be returning again."

From the beautiful private drive in, the craftsmanship and cleanliness of the loghouse, the many activities and adventures that await you, down to the ease of having every single thing at your fingertips - this place gets 5 stars all the way!
We enjoyed every option offered, and ran out of energy before we ran out of things to do. We invited our family out for lunch and a day of adventures, including catching 3 nice size bass, walking & riding all the trails, walking down to the creek and then up and down the creek b/c it was 80 degrees outside - but we loved every minute of it. And made so many great memories with loved ones! Thank you for the thoughtfulness and detail put into Bolo Loghouse! We will be back sooner than later to try out the Birdhouse!"

Group trip","If you are thinking about booking, you absolutely should! The property is huge and the cabin itself is awesome. We slept 5 adults and a 1 year old comfortably. I would recommend bringing your own pillows if you are picky like me, but they had much more than enough blankets/towels which was so nice. They have everything you need to feel right at home and much more to do than we expected. We built a fire, played yard games, went tubing, walked the trails, and that was just at the cabin itself. Picayune is a little hidden gem. Lots of things to do, eat, and buy. We checked out the candy store, cupcake shop, and a few restaurants. We loved all of them. I wish we would’ve stayed for longer. If you’re coming from Louisiana, it’s RIGHT there! We will definitely be back. (Hopefully soon!!!)"

I love the request to remove your shoes upon entering, and there is a cute rack to place them. We do this at home because of my son's allergies, so again, we felt right at home. Also, the neighbors were nice and friendly.
If you are looking for a quiet and comfortable place that feels like home during your travels, this is it. Seriously, book this place, and you won't regret it! We usually reserve places along the coast when we're in the area, but now those spots have some serious competition."

Stayed a few nights","Such a special gem of a place! Was able to book a short notice stay because I wanted to get out of the New Orleans bustle for my birthday and set out to find a listing in the quiet countryside in driving distance, and I cannot get over how perfect Chickie's Roost was! A real birthday dream come true, especially for an animal lover like myself. Aside from how cozy and clean the barn apartment is, we were able to stay warm in the January cold thanks to the heaters provided and the plethora of blankets to wrap up in. But hands down my favorite part of my stay was the therapeutic farm animals ready to greet as soon as you step out the door. From the beautiful & gentle horses that roam, the adorable herding dogs, Sable the barn cat who cuddled on my lap purring while I enjoyed my morning coffee on the patio, the hens, and the star of the show-- Biscuit the pony, it's nearly impossible for me to pick a favorite.
Needless to say I did not want to leave, and will be returning again & again."

Group trip","Chickies Roost was a peaceful beautiful picturesque property! A quaint rustic two story apartment over the barn where three of the four beds are upstairs all together in one large open loft room. We loved it! It’s a very clean safe quiet antique barn apartment replete with sweet precious resident animals like Sable the cat who is so affectionate. We got to feed apples to the three horses and a precious mini horse! There’s a pull out sofa bed downstairs in the cozy tv room if you need it. Lavonne is a wonderful host. She provides so much for her guests! Snacks, coffee pods, creamer, fresh oranges, shampoo, a blow dryer, lots of towels and more! The kitchen is small and rustic w/ a nice kitchen table but keep in mind theres no stove or oven but a good microwave & mini fridge. There’s also a nice full bath up there. Keep in mind its not a modern apartment but very well done! 1 of the beds is a futon, 1 an antique bed, 1 a sofa bed but 1 is a very nice comfortable queen. We’ll be back!"

She’s met my other 2 but had yet to meet Moose. :) We enjoyed walking the grounds, sitting on the porch and petting 2 of the horses and a couple of the cats and dogs. Lavonne provided descriptions of each of the animals on the refrigerator. Haha! Love that! My stay was in late Nov. and the barn gets a bit chilly but there was a space heater provided which I used for the bathroom and there are tons of blankets/throws provided. The bed was comfortable. I’d definitely consider staying here again because of the proximity to my mom’s house and the fact that it’s such a peaceful retreat. Wonderful host. Thank you so much!"

Stayed with a pet","If you get a chance to stay here, DO IT! One of the best AirBnB’s I’ve stayed at! So peaceful and quiet! The animals were a plus! 3 horses, one pony, two dogs, 3 cats and chickens! Lavonne had everything you could possibly want or need, plus more! The bath towels were big and fluffy, two coffee makers with anything you wanted to put in your coffee. Snacks, water, etc. The beds were super comfortable and had two sitting areas with TV’s, one upstairs and one downstairs! We wished we could have stayed longer! Town was a short drive away with plenty of restaurants and a Walmart. The perfect combination."

The Chickie's Roost was so warm and welcoming from our hostess Lavonne to the animals, including Sable the Cat. Our only regret is that we did not stay longer. Lavonne was very helpful with recommendations and allowing us a little extra time to check out. We hope we can return to stay there again."

Lavonne provided an amazing amount of thoughtful extras: bug spray & hand sanitizer by the front door, snacks in the kitchen, bubbles for the kids, carrots for the kids to feed the horses, a helpful list of restaurant recommendations, fun information on all the animals on the property. So quiet & peaceful! We can’t wait to go back & stay longer!"

Stayed with kids","This was our last night of a 16-Night road trip from North Carolina to California and back. We stayed in many unique places, such as a treehouse, an earth ship a Wigwam, a vintage camper, a restored silo and a restored box car. This ended up being one of the most favorite places, mostly because of how warm and friendly the host was, how inviting the accommodation was, and the ability to spread out and re-organize the car for the last push home. I would love to visit again and stay longer. Oh, and the farm critters were a lot of fun too!"

Lavonne is amazing and super friendly, responsive and helpful. Everything you needed was there, from an amazing coffee and snack bar, to local recommendations on where to eat, she definitely is the hostess with the mostest. There are also board games and toys for children, along with outdoor activities like corn hole and darts, as well as bikes if you have time! Our other host immediately greeted us with delight and spent lots of time with us outside, that would be Sable the cat, soooo friendly and adorable. If you’re looking for peacefulness, privacy, and an amazing farm style experience this is the place! Rustic and well maintained, this is a gem amongst the rest!!

Stayed with a pet","Chickie's Roost is idyllic, tranquil, and beautiful. Sable the barn cat met us on arrival, sat on our laps, and took naps with us. The apartment is just as described on the website and is even cozier than it looks in pictures. The decor and special touches are amazing from an old stetson ad, an antique rocking horse, vintage family photos, and lots of cute chickies.
It was so peaceful to sit in the rocking chairs and just watch the horses and cows graze and enjoy the scenery. We fed apples to the horses, hung out with Sable, and watched the chickens.
Even though it's secluded and quiet, it is a very short drive to restaurants, Walmart, and stores. We had a delicious meal at Creekside Coffee Cafe for Thursday Night Steak Night.
As an added bonus, we really enjoyed chatting with Lavonne and learning about her and the farm. She's very friendly and lovely to spend time with. We can't wait to get back to Chickie's Roost!"

If you are looking for a quiet get away that is worth every dollar,I would recommend this to all.

Stayed a few nights","A place that feels less like an airbnb and more like a true home away from home- had more love and care put into it than other places I've stayed that were in actual houses, a pleasantly surprising amount of bonus accomdiations and great upkeep of the home and grounds in general, which is impressive considering it doesnt seem it would be the easiest place to clean! The experience I everything I wanted out of it and more, a peaceful and comfortable stay in the country with friendly animals right on your doorstep"

Stayed a few nights","Chickie's Roost exceeded our expectations in every way.
Prior to arrival, Lavonne was very responsive - usually just within a couple of minutes - and she made sure everything was ready for our arrival. Checking in was completely effortless.
The farm is beautiful, and the barn apartment is very unique and charming. You feel like you are totally away from it all, yet groceries, restaurants, pharmacies, gas, and all of the necessary conveniences are within 3 miles.
If I had done nothing else, just sitting outside in the morning with a cup of coffee and watching the sun rise over the farm with Sable the cat sitting in my lap was probably my favorite thing I did during our stay. I highly recommend Lavonne as a host and Chickie's Roost as a fun, relaxing place to stay with something for the entire family."

Stayed a few nights","The Chickie's Roost was the perfect spot for a weekend getaway. The host is so kind and hospitable and easy to communicate with. I loved all the little thoughtful touches—fresh roses on the table, snacks and drinks, two types of coffee choices.
My co-author friend and I planned our annual writing retreat and chose the Chickie's Roost for its location and price. We got so much more than we expected. The wifi was fast and reliable. We had plenty of space to spread out and each have our own work spaces. The views from the bay window were stunning. We spent time out on the farm with the horses and cats and dogs—who were all quite friendly! It was the perfect combination of relaxing and inspirational with all the necessities to allow for productivity. Location-wise, it's only a few miles off the interstate. I would recommend this airbnb to families (plenty of room for kids both inside and out), to anyone just wanting to get away to a serene location or to anyone needing a quiet spot to work.
I cannot wait to book my next stay at the Chickie's Roost!"

At night we sat out and fed the horses carrots, apples and bread. The cats came around and were very friendly as were the dogs. if you are looking for quiet and peaceful its a must.

Stayed with kids","We had a great time visiting the farm, my young daughters 9 and 7 each brought a friend and it was a wonderful opportunity for them to be in nature with horses roaming free on acres of land. Unique and special experience that is a great value too and not far from home. Was a nice place to celebrate my moms 70th birthday during the Covid-19 social distancing. The change I'd scenery was lovely and fresh pink roses in a case from the host was thoughtful and appreciated, along with the great Keurig coffee and nespresso pods and small bottles waters under the little fridge! The washer and dryer was helpful too when the rain came and my daughter got a kiss on the shoulder froma horse they enjoyed feeding! Thanks for a new experience. Note: it is lovely the host let's you visit the horses in the field, but if you have kids please be careful bc we did see a snake and a very friendly cat scratched some when she wanted more attention. If you stay inside you won't even know the cats, horses and dogs are there if you aren't much of an animal person, or allergic to cats like me. But the kids enjoyed the attention. Short drive to the beach and sunflower picking farm too. Grateful the girls had a little excitement during the stay in summer!"

Speaking of animals, if you are an animal lover, their horses, dogs, and cats will all greet you and enjoy a good scratch.
Amenities available here are very clean. The bathroom had more than enough towels and wash cloths. Should you need to wash any clothing or linens though, there is a washer and dryer on-site with detergents and fabric softener.

Stayed a few nights",Such a nice place. I fully recommend staying here. It’s tucked away right in the center of town. Slept so well and the renovations and amenities were great. Free coffee and some snacks. Filtered water from the refrigerator. Everything is brand new. The smart TV was great. I will definitely try to stay here when I’m in town next time to visit my family.

Stayed a few nights","Had a great stay at Petite NOLA! Easy check-in/check-out, spotlessly clean, and extremely cozy. Donna is a great host and included several extras…even left me Halloween treat bags that I handed out to trick-or-treaters! Definitely recommend and will rent again when in the area!"

Stayed with a pet","This may have been the best Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. The place was clean, and had all the amenities we needed. I appreciated that there were plenty of deposable household items (plenty of trash bags, paper towels, toilet paper, etc.) as opposed to a single roll of paper towels that many places provide. They provided extras we weren’t even expecting (like brownies and snacks). The lake and surrounding area is beautiful. We took advantage of kayaks and canoes on site. When we communicated, Brian was responsive. Great place and great hosts!!! Five stars!!!"

Stayed with a pet","Beautiful home right on the lake. The house was clean and private. The host provided so many recreational items such as fishing poles and tackle, kayaks, paddle board, a canoe, a small boat, and indoor and outdoor games. Brian goes above and beyond. Responds quickly and even provided a nice welcome basket and a small dessert. There were so many small touches that shows how much Brian cares. Highly recommend this vacation home."

Stayed with a pet","This was one of the best Airbnb experiences we’ve had. It had absolutely everything we needed and more than we expected. Brian left a special baked treat that made my little girl’s day!
Everything was super clean. There were too many extra amenities to list.
The beds were all comfortable. The home spacious, and I love the electric fireplace. Great ambiance.
The outdoor space was so beautiful. The amenities out there were perfect for fun and relaxing. The dock in great shape.
We were there for a wedding and have no reason to return to the area except now I want to go back and stay because it was just so nice!!"

Everything was so thoughtful, planned out, and easy to access. I loved our stay and will definitely be back. Brian is a great operator, and really goes out of his way to provide an amazing experience.
House was clean, quite, and everything they made it out to be."

Stayed with a pet","This is a home we hope to revisit by ourselves (me and my husband) or with the family. Its super clean, beautiful, had EVERYTHING we needed and more! Welcome basket was a first for us and we airbnb often. We were in town for a wedding at The Villa, but since we are from the Northshore of New Orleans, we took the short 45 minute drive to see a parade and friends!
In the little downtime we had, we utilized the firepit right outside under those Mississippi stars. We also used the kayaks twice and went around the lake. The yard was sprawling and great for our 2 small pups.
Inside, they even had a dog bed and blanket to cover the couch if the dogs decided to snuggle up there, which they did once.
It is an immaculately clean and beautiful place. Makes me wanna go home and redo so many things in my home! 🤣
Extremely peaceful. Easy to get to. Homey. Perfect stay."

Stayed a few nights","This property is a gem. Beautiful house, beautiful property on the lake. The neighborhood is very peaceful. There was plenty of room for our family of 4. It was well stocked with many thoughtful touches throughout to make it feel like home. We did not cook, but we did use the plates, glasses and silverware from the well stocked cabinets. The beds were comfortable. Even though it was a little chilly during our visit, our college-aged kids had a great time exploring the lake on the kayak and paddle board. Brian had excellent communication and was prompt with responses and clear directions. We would definitely stay here again the next time we visit the area!"

We enjoyed staying close to our family and having such a beautiful home to rest in and recoup. Couldn't ask for anything else. The perfect home to make you feel true southern hospitality!

Stayed a few nights","I believe in giving an honest review. This home was very nice and modern. The beds were comfortable which is important to us. It is frustrating that they only leave one towel and one washcloth per person for a two day stay. I don’t mind using the same towel, but it would be nice to have a clean washcloth for each day without having to wash a load of clothes. Also, the living room is sparsely furnished—barely enough room for 4 people to sit. Could use a few more chairs."
