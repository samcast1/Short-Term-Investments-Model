Stayed one night","Gorgeous view of the valley and the mountains behind the valley. Extremely clean and neat. Very quiet and peaceful. A wonderful place to relax. We were here for a family event and did not have a lot of time. Looking out the windows and stepping out onto the deck just eased the travel tension from our shoulders.
We are seniors. I would mention that the bedroom is very small with a full size (double) bed that almost stretches wall to wall. We did not happen to see the photo of the bed which shows the left side of the bed pushed actually to the wall. When we got there the bed on the left side had been shifted to the right but there was still very little room to walk. This could be a danger for older and mobility challenged people. It might need to be highlighted for safety reasons.
The bathroom was very nice with a great shower. Altogether a nice stay. Thank you."

Stayed one night","This has to be one of the best Airbnb’s I’ve ever stayed in!! It was even better than the pictures! The place was spotless, incredibly spacious, clean, beautiful and minimalistic decorating. The hosts were very easy to communicate with. Check in was a breeze. The view was to die for! My husband and I live near a big city and it was so relaxing to get away and stay in this serene little cottage and breathe some fresh air.
Thank you Matthew for the hospitality!!"

My wife and I stayed during a winter storm and the owner of the house came out to plow the driveway, shovel the snow off the stairs and walkway, and helped tow us when it got icy and we couldn’t make it up the hill! The hosts were very responsive and friendly and the house itself was very clean. Overall, it was a great place to stay!"

When you walk through the door, you see the clean bathroom to the left and the cute bedroom to the right. The bed was comfortable and had enough pillows for my husband and myself! The bathroom had enough towels for both of us and the water pressure/temperature were amazing! Straight ahead you see the spacious living room/kitchen area filled with everything you need! The view from the back porch was fantastic! I took many beautiful photos of the scenery. This is such a cute town with great coffee shops and local shopping to go to! I highly recommend this place if you want a quiet, scenic place to relax and unwind."

It’s a great getaway for one or two people, spacious open living/dining area and a cute deck to enjoy morning coffee or evening drinks. No tv but I didn’t mind being more disconnected. Wi-Fi was easily accessible and the hosts were very communicative and friendly. 30 minute drive to a lot of restaurants/shops. I wish I would’ve gotten to spend a little more time here because it was such a cozy spot."

The place was very clean and had plenty of room for my friend and I! We both worked a few night shifts and the only problem we had was that the rooms were very bright when we tried to sleep during the day so we had to do some make shift blackout curtains to help us sleep. Overall the place was very clean and well taken care of. We felt very safe in the area and would recommend this place to anyone!

Stayed over a week","The neighborhood was very quiet. It felt like a safe area of Altoona. The hospital is only 5 minutes away. The furnishings were tasteful, and the aesthetic when you walk in is lovely. There were little extras that were great to have, such as paper plates, napkins, plastic silverware, laundry soap, dryer sheets, etc. The owners recycle and provided a container for cans, paper, plastic bottles, etc. that was picked up with the trash. There were a couple of things that weren’t ideal, however. The towels were covered with “fuzz” that got all over me and the floor the first time I used them. The tub in the upstairs bathroom did not drain well, so I was always standing in a few inches of water when showering. I did tell Tom about it when I moved out, and he said he would take care of it, and I should have let him know sooner, which I probably should have. I just hate having to deal with problems in a rental that should be ready to go when I move in. Overall, it was a nice place to stay."

There are pots and pans so I was able to cook a lot without issues. Heat worked well on cold winter nights. Tom was also very responsive and answered any questions quickly. The only reason I took off one star was because there was a little funky smell coming from the bathroom sink drain. The smell went away if the drain was kept closed.

Stayed over a week","My husband and I needed a short term rental while moving into a new house in the area. We were so pleased to find Tom and this adorable cottage! He was extremely welcoming, and offered us a special discount for the two months we were there. The house was perfect! It was newly remodeled, extremely clean, and had just about every amenity you could hope for! I can’t say enough how exceptionally fast Tom was when needing to communicate, and how helpful he was when we needed extra information. His maintenance team was very knowledgeable, and quickly responded to remedy ice on the sidewalks. We felt really pleased with the professionalism across-the-board! I would not hesitate for a moment to highly recommend Tom and this adorable rental. Would absolutely stay again, although we are happy to be in our new home! Staying here made the experience less stressful when we needed a temporary home base. By the way, Tom’s house is super close to many restaurants, several grocery stores, a family pizza place, etc. it is located in a safe, relatively quiet neighborhood, and very easy to get to from all locations!"

I also thought the price I paid was a great deal. All around outstanding stay.

Different shops and businesses to walk to. The Chinese restaurant across the street was very busy and had great reviews; we just didn't have the time to eat there. Jennifer's home is cosy and welcoming. There was no clutter and it was pristine. It made leaving difficult and I hope to stay there next time I am in town.

Stayed a few nights","The apartment was beautiful and thoughtfully decorated with ample kitchen equipment, bathroom towels, and thoughtful touches. We enjoyed the airy kitchen and the cozy sitting area. As older adults with questionable knees, we found navigating the steps down from the master bedroom and then up to bathroom and main living area a bit difficult for middle of the night bathroom trips - would have loved a bedroom option in the ""office room"" across the hall from the bathroom to avoid this nocturnal step issue for us older folks (and for families with small kids as well). Other than our elderly knee issues, we found the apartment to be lovely, comfortable, clean, and so walkable to cute boutiques, restaurants, and coffee shops to visit between wedding and social events. Highly recommend!"

But it is also only 2 minutes away from restaurants, convenience stores, bars, etc. For me, a perfect location. Sheri is a wonderful and communicative host. She also has a really cool big white dog that I got to meet - that was great. The place is spotless, had everything I needed, and the fresh eggs from their own chickens (along with other breakfast items) are a nice touch. This is definitely my new first choice when visiting the area."

Stayed a few nights","LIVES UP TO THE HYPE!
My partner and I booked a stay at Sheri's guesthouse this past week and were blown away by the house and hospitality. Every detail was taken care of, from fresh eggs from the hosts' chickens, to easy-to-find extra phone chargers for those of us who are forgetful.
The guesthouse is CUTE! It's cozy, bright, comfortable, and stocked with everything we could need. Even though it's on the same property as the hosts' house, we felt like we had plenty of privacy.
We loved sitting outside on the patio looking at the orchard and listening to the cicadas. What a wonderful place to relax!
The kitchen was well stocked and nice to cook in. I get so excited for an airbnb with a gas stove, and I had a blast testing a new cake recipe in the guesthouse oven. (Sorry I didn't think to leave a piece for Sheri, now that I'm thinking of it...)
Sheri was quick to respond to messages and very helpful! She was flexible with our checkout when we realized we'd need more time.
I met the cat - it's very sweet! I did not meet the dog, but I will plan another trip soon to remedy this."

Stayed a few nights","I LOVE this space!! I do a solo retreat two or three times a year to reboot after 9 or 10 weeks of 60-80 hour work weeks. Sheri's cottage is the BEST place I have stayed. It is perfect for one or two people with a large, comfy couch for reading, watching TV during rain, or just hanging out. The bedroom is so cozy with perfect bedding. The kitchen is small, but I had no problems cooking and getting around to make food.
The door and patio are private, so it was awesome sitting outside every day. I was able to go visit the chickens and turkeys, as well as chat with Koda each day... the ""dog-bear"" as I called him. (He is a very friendly, large floofy pup.) Is very quiet on the patio - not much noise from cars passing. At night, it was even better with the cicadas in full symphony.
I highly recommend for anyone seeking 3 or 4 days (or more) to have an easy retreat. Sheri kindly puts items in fridge, including fresh eggs, to welcome you and give you some snacks/food. Grocery stores not far... easy drive to anything. Sheri is also available for quesyions: she replied to emails very quickly. I will be back!"

The missed nothing in terms of simple welcoming touches....from fresh eggs (from their beautiful chickens in a coop up the hill) to Trivia games to a pack of fresh bagels and a complete Coffee&Tea bar. I cooked breakfast every morning on the fabulous gas stove and just relaxed --and did all the things I never have time to do...watch some good Netflix or PrimeVideo movies, read a vintage book about chicken breeds (I want to have a little chicken and goat farm some day) --take a walk down the wooded streets of the quiet neighborhood to the local convenience store. Only about 30 minutes from Penn State so if you're going to the game and want to get away from the crowds -- this is the place to stay! Perfect for couples or solo travelers and digital nomads like me. I now know what I want my own cottage home to look and feel like:-) I will definitely be back, because I already miss Koda, their handsome Great Pyrenees dog who visited me at the fence daily.

Sheri’s apartment, although small(ish) is the most thoughtful Airbnb of them all. Perfect for two people. She makes the space feel like home. It’s beautifully decorated and so so cozy inside (and so clean). She gets the award for most comfortable and lovely bed. I felt like I was sleeping on a cloud. Everything in the apartment was wonderful.
The fresh farm eggs, additional foods and drinks were really thoughtful touches. And the coffee too! Koda, her pup is such a sweet boy. He lets you scratch his nose and is a wonderful friend nearby. I loved listening to the turkeys too!
Beautiful space, would be a joy to rent from Sheri again. It’s a gem of a place."

Stayed over a week","What a beautiful, cozy place! We were able to spend our honeymoon here and it was wonderful to not have to worry about anything. We loved having a kitchen where we could cook together! The hosts were quick to respond and we knew they were there should we need anything. We felt more than welcome and taken care of. Check in & out were easy and painless!
Definitely an excellent little gem in Altoona! A must stay!"

Stayed a few nights","Sheri's place was outstanding. It is cozy, little place decorated very cute and super clean. The little patio has a view of their backyard where you can see their chickens roaming. It was very quiet and peaceful. Sheri's hospitality includes farm fresh eggs, juice and bagels in the refrigerator upon arrival. There was private parking and she allows guests to visit. We absolutely loved this place. It's within a 30 minute drive to the Ghost Town Trail depending on where you want to start off. We also visited Horseshoe Curve Railroad which is about 10 minutes from her place and well worth a visit. There are many restaurants to choose from and we ordered take out from Carolina Barbecue and Jaidee Thai, both very good."

Stayed one night","A hidden gem in the middle of PA for a peaceful getaway/stop on a road trip. While I was driving to Sheri’s place I was very skeptical; there were almost nothing besides cornfields, barns and mountains on the way. But as soon as I arrived and checked in, Sheri’s cozy guesthouse made me feel welcomed. There are fresh eggs, bagels, water and OJ in the fridge, as well as some food that you can prepare in the kitchen. Although it isn’t very big, this place has everything and is sparkly clean. I woke up to a friendly tuxedo cat waiting at the door, saw some chickens running around and admired the orchard in Sheri’s backyard before I had to take off again. Thanks for the great stay! 10/10 would recommend."

Stayed one night","Sheri was the best host I have stayed with so far. Really outstanding. The ac went out before we got there. We thought that the 1 night stay would be miserable. But Sheri put fans around the place and apologized on top of giving us a discount. The fans did the trick, I slept quite well! The little above the garage cottage is the cutest, sweetest place I have been. Sheri has a natural knack of decorating superbly, at the same time making an incredibly comfortable place! From thick decadent towels, to bathrobes to maps on the walls to put pins in from where you are from! The local neighborhood is really beautiful as well. Their pets are also great additions to the ambiance. Ollie the cat came over and visited with us quite often in the 1 morning that we where there. Last but not least, there where great, fresh eggs and english muffins in the fridge. Thanks for such a great stay!"

Stayed with kids","The host did an amazing job about communicating before and during the stay, and answered messages very promptly. I felt very safe knowing if anything came up, we would be fine! The house was spotless, everything in the listing was provided and then some. Extra towels, linens and pillows on every bed, house utensils, light fluid, tiki torch fluid, laundry detergent, gas for the grill, s’mores marshmallow holders, I mean it has everything. The outdoor deck area is something of a dream. The setup is absolutely fabulous, the hot tub is amazing, and the fire pit completes the stay with a cozy place to huddle around. The house is very secluded, you will not have to worry about neighbors! The WiFi was very fast, the A.C. Kept the house very cool, and the showers did not disappoint. The water pressure in the house is perfect, and the water gets nice and hot. The beds are very comfy, not a stiff bed in the entire house! And do not forget to check out the massage couch! 10/10 stay!!"

Lynette and her husband were very accommodating and personable. They shared the history of Overbrook Farm and encouraged us enjoy the whole property. Visiting with the goats and horses out in the fields or at the barn was quite a treat! The house is fully furnished with many interesting details to love and admire. You will definitely feel like you are right at home at Overbrook Farm. The location gave us easy access to other small towns around the area to explore-coming back to the beauty of the farm and enjoying the wrap around porch as the day came to a close. The porch was also a great place for morning coffee and peaceful contemplation. Our family enjoyed it so much, that we will be back in June! I highly recommend staying at Overbrook Farm!"

Stayed a few nights","It was an easy stay. I have been working 10-12 hr days for months and was visiting Altoona to see my parents. It was definitely time to relax. We arrived later in the day and it was easy to get in. We parked in front and while there was snow and ice nearby the area in front of the house was clear, salted, and safe. Plenty of towels and space for myself, wife and our two college kids. It was nice to be able to sit and talk with them at night in the family room. The house was clean, and ready to go. I can't think of a thing missed by our hosts."

Very clean, spacious, lots of amenities, and the hosts were thoughtful and gracious. We did not meet them, but they were super responsive and helpful through the app.
Some things to note- the house is cooled through window AC units. They got the job done even during some very hot weather. The laundry is conveniently located in the upstairs bathroom— older units with some noise. May be best to use before bed. There is a fenced portion of the yard with old wood and tire swings. Our kids thought they were fantastic. Lots of games and movies too. Nicely decorated. Bathrooms were well appointed. All in all, we had a great stay here for a family get together. Our kids didn’t want to leave."

We had trouble with the stairs to the second floor. Knee replacement and balance issues made it difficult to climb the upper half as there was no railing available to help with the climb. A grab handle at the top would have helped.
It was wonderful to see deer in the fields when coming back after dark. The fat groundhog we named Marty came out a couple of times plus a couple of rabbits made an appearance. The quiet was blissful and the fall foliage was beautiful!
We definately will stay again.
Blessings,

Stayed a few nights","This place is incredible!! The house was comfortable, private, and located on a beautiful and secluded piece of land. It was attractively furnished and had every supply you could need -- cooking supplies and spices, towels, soaps, blankets, you name it.
Kerri and Mike were superb hosts. They went the extra mile to give us detailed instructions, answer all of our questions, and help us out when we were at the house.
For visitors coming during the cold weather: the house was a great place for snuggling up with a good book and watching the snow fall. It has a wood pellet stove which was a nice touch that left us feeling very cozy in the frigid winter weather. When it snowed, Mike plowed the driveway and shoveled around our car.
For nature lovers, this place is also located a reasonable drive to several notable wildlife viewing locations, including several state parks and state game lands. We checked out Yellow Creek State Park and Prince Gallitzin State Park, both of which had hundreds of waterfowl on the water. There were also plenty of birds eating from the bird feeders around the house.
When you stay, check out Kerri and Mike's Fat Caps Fungi, which has lots of different mushroom-based products for sale. I really liked the Sweet Balsamic and Fig Mushroom Jerky."

Beautiful sunrises. Excellent internet - I was there to complete a work project and was online ALL day. The bed I slept in was VERY comfortable - best night's sleep in years (no joke).
Very clean, very nice. I stayed during the winter in bad weather and before I arrived, the driveway had been plowed and salt was put down so I wouldn't slip. The pellet stove was on and the house was warm upon arrival and stayed very comfortable even in below 0 temperatures."

The house is cozy and has great amenities, plenty of seating and nicely appointed kitchen. The Roku TV was a nice touch as well.
The mattresses were all new and very comfortable.
They've got a booklet with great local destinations as well as for and drinks listed. Also note there's a Walmart in close proximity in case of forgotten items at home. Mine was a birthday cake....

The next morning we woke up to a basket of duck and country chicken eggs by our door (they didn't promise anything) and later they took us on a tractor ride to see the farm and mushroom cultivation. They told us about the nice places to go around there too.
The beds were smelling clean, and the house was very clean too.
Wifi and TV work perfectly. They have Roku so you can connect your movie provider there. We easily connected our Hulu account.
The kitchen has basically anything you might need to cook everyday stuff.
There are a fireplace and a grill at the back of the house.

The farm house is nestled in a windy hollar where you can sit on the porch and enjoy some coffee while listening to the sounds of a rushing stream, away from all the distractions of life. It is well stocked with all the necessities, clean and comfortable! Away from the city lights, this place is perfect for star gazing on dark summer nights.

Stayed a few nights","Mike and Kerri are just about the nicest people you will ever meet. I never got to meet kerri in person but she was very accommodating and courteous over the phone. Mike was awesome, we were making garlic bread one night and forgot to pick up garlic so to save us a trip he actually gave us some fresh garlic. They also have ducks and they allowed us to pick some fresh eggs one morning.(they are sweeter than chicken eggs and taste a lot better)
The house was always warm and the water heats up very quickly. Plenty of bedding and it was very clean. If its snowing while you stay I highly recommend bringing sleds along because the house is on the side of a big hill. It's so peaceful out there and if your are looking for mountain country get away, I highly recommend this place.
If its snowing make sure you have 4x4 if you are going to blue knob. The roads can get bad
It is 20-25 minutes away from blue knob and 11 minutes away from a Walmart and gas.
Definitely making this an annual vacation spot."

Group trip","Overall the place was very nice. It was spacious, newly renovated, and in a nice neighborhood. The owner was also quick to provide the Wi-Fi password when I messaged them.
The only thing that was worrisome was that the host accidentally sent me a code a week before our stay, and then apologized as it was not meant to go to me. When it came time for our check in, we never received a code. I messaged the owner and since we didn’t hear back for 2 hrs, we tried the code that was sent a week prior and it unlocked the door. It’s not safe to keep the same code, as it should be changed between stays.
Most of the bedroom and bathroom trash cans were full when we check in, which was frustrating. There was also a toothbrush and razor left behind, so overall it was clean but not to the extent you’d expect.
There was also not enough towels, so I’d recommend bringing some of your own.
I would still stay at this Airbnb again, but there’s just a few adjustments that need to be made"

Stayed a few nights","The central location of this place is fantastic. We stayed for a weekend golfing trip in the Altoona area, and everything was within 20 minutes drive. This place is walkable to multiple fast food places and gas stations. Easy to get in and out.
The only issue was the neighbor's dog constantly barking at us every time we were on the back deck."

Stayed with a pet","The space and location is great for visiting Altoona. It comfortably fit 4 adults, 2 children and 2 dogs. There was a small fenced in area out back for the dogs. It was easy to get to restaurants, grocery stores and Lakemont Park within 5 min.
The only downside is the neighbor's dog (named Cherokee). He's about 80-90 lbs and very loud. He will jump up on the fence and bark constantly. If your family or your pets aren't comfortable around large dogs, he will scare them. My dogs just ignored him and sniffed the calmer one when it was outside alone. If Cherokee can see you through the window, you go outside, or he sees anything else move around his house, he barks non-stop any time he's outside. This could be anytime from 6 am to 10 pm.
We spoke with the neighbors, who are friendly, and tried giving him treats, but nothing works. They can't get him to stop barking either.
Other than the dog, it was a nice stay."

The house itself was comfortable and decorated nicely, though the downstairs bedroom was visibly dirty/dusty and the bunk beds were missing sheets. Since we were only there to sleep at night we weren’t too worried.. but it was surprising given how tidy the upstairs was. Overall, we‘d stay again!"

Stayed with a pet","I think the best way to describe this stay was a series of unfortunate events. I booked Matt’s place over Christmas. Matt was nice enough to let us know when the house was ready so we could check in early, unfortunately someone had set the alarm system and when we got inside it triggered it. Matt did not respond to texts/phone calls or airbnb messenger so we had to wait for the police to arrive to give a statement. We gave our statement to the police in -20° weather, two hours later Matt got back to us saying the alarm was disarmed and we were good to return. The following day we get back to the house and notice a water pipe had burst in the attached garage. Again tried calling Matt and the number for his local contact, no answer. 2 hours later he did get back to us and another hour after that let us know the leak had been fixed and could return to the house. We had already booked a hotel at this point so we did not return. House was beautiful and well decorated though. Very clean."

Stayed with a pet","Places like this make me think AirBNB is going to put hotels out of business. The price was great for the amount of space and bedrooms. It was clean and smelled good. It was located less than a mile from the interstate with very easy access to it and was centrally located in Altoona, but was still very quiet. The stairs are a little steep for older people and older dogs, but that's not really a complaint. It just is what it is and if it had been a problem, it would have been on me to catch before agreeing to rent. Just something to think about if you or someone with you has a problem with steep, high stairs. That said, there was a bedroom in the basement that did not require climbing any stairs. Anyway... five stars!"

All of the lights in the cabin were on, the heat was on, and there were plush blankets everywhere you looked. The thoughtful touches of inspirational signs and combination of wood and stone construction were so well done and inviting. This peaceful property has a firepit, lanterns, and a stone farmhouse setting with a mountain view in the distance to wake up to in the morning. It is immaculate, and every need has been thought of. Our only request would be to have directions available on how to best use the wood burning stove. The Little Cabin is so perfect, we booked our next year's stay already, and can't wait to visit again. Thank you for providing an ideal home-away-from-home for our traveling family! 💗🙏"

And the snow and persistent snow flurries added to the experience. Pictures on Airbnb don't do this place justice, especially the bathroom on the main floor. Amanda's communication was helpful and prompt before and during our stay. Spent our Saturday afternoon in State College and attended a PSU men's ice hockey game. Would have loved to enjoy the back patio and fire pit, but freezing temperatures and high winds kiboshed those plans. Oh well, maybe next time."

Stayed with kids","We came up for the Delgrosso's Water & Amusement Park, being it was 2.5 hours away from our house, we decided to make a mini trip out of it! Went on Air B&B and found this little nest. We got to the water park at 11am when they opened and having a 3- and 5-year-old in 95-degree heat, we knew they would get tired. Around 1:45 we packed up for the 6-minute drive from the park to the cabin. check in wasnt until 3pm- but we went for it and at 2pm we were able to access the property an hour early! This saved us from so many headaches. The gate was awesome, but the fence does not go the whole way around.
Now for inside- IMMACULATE! From cleanliness to general stock- they had it all! I love fishing, and they are working on the pond in front of the cabin currently but gave us access to another location that we were able to catch 30+ fish between the 4 of us. The walking trails behind the house connect to this location as well. Little boat and Kayak provided for some paddling around the pond."

High end appliances, fixtures, and furnishings personify the rural charm and elegance of the lodge and the village of Tipton. It was obvious every detail was given considerable thought and designed for ultimate luxury and comfort. The proprietors definitely had a vision and excelled at craftsmanship and every finite detail to provide a unique and serene experience. The Tipton Run Lodge is a superior alternative to the local hotels."

Stayed a few nights","Excellent place to stay. My wife, my adult son and I stayed to fish some of the prime PA trout streams. It was only a 15 to 20 minute drive to The Little Juniata with other streams within a 5 to 10 minute drive. Great cabin in a very peaceful setting. Cabin was very clean and comfortable. Josh was very responsive. Very easy check in and check out. Tons of fun things to do and places to eat in this area. Would definitely stay again."

Stayed about a week","Peaceful, quiet, secluded cabin that feels far from the rest of the world but is only about 15 minutes away from all of the conveniences. This warm, comfy, cozy home is just minutes from a beautiful state park! We thoroughly enjoyed morning coffee and relaxing late evenings on the front porch. Early instructions were helpful in preparing for the stay & Joshua was very responsive & very understanding around check in and questions during the stay. Will definitely stay again!"

Checking in was a breeze and the cabin itself is beautiful. I checked in a bit late and enjoyed a hot shower and some tv followed by a very comfortable bed. Joshua himself was kind and helpful. Overall, worth the experience if you’re staying in the area."

Although you can’t leave the yard, it’s bordered by farm fields where you can see deer, fire flies, bats, and storms. I appreciated that it wasn’t cluttered with things. It was simple and just what we needed."

Stayed a few nights","After spending years booking at Altoona hotels, Joshua's cabin was a beautiful break from hotel life. The cabin in extremely peaceful and is in a country setting but close to Altoona/Hollidaysburg/Raystown and within striking distance of State College. If you love the sounds of birds and enjoy a beautiful front porch view this is your place. The cabin itself is very clean, comfortable bed/furniture and Joshua provides everything you need for a cozy visit. It has high ceilings which is a wonderful aspect of this cabin. You will stay upstairs and that bedroom has a very pretty view. Canoe Creek is minutes away if you're up for a hike or swim (fishing too) and Raystown is a short drive. The Altoona Curve ballpark is a quick 10-12 min drive over Frankstown mountain. Altoona is 10-15 minutes and Hollidaysburg is even closer. I will definitely ask to book again and cannot get enough of the interior Knotty Pine cabin feel and serene setting of this cabin. Thank you Joshua!"

Stayed a few nights","Make sure to bring socks and throw blankets. It can be a little chilly. Be ready the house makes some creepy noises at night! It sounded like someone was walking around the first night after we went to bed. The second night it sounded like something was dragging around while we were watching tv. I liked the house it was cute and smelled divine. Very clean. Josh was proactive in checking that things were going well. I think the summer and fall would be beautiful. it was kinda dreary landscapewise, but that was due to the season."

Canoe park is very close to the house as well as several streams to spend time in nature. Lots of deer to see as well. The house is perfect for a 2 person getaway. Very clean and cozy. Can’t wait to book again!

There was enough parking for the truck and the boat. Would definitely recommend this location!"

I had a situation with a person staying with me (disgruntled employee) and the owner quickly helped me by changing the door code.
One thing that could have been better was the management company communication with the owner. They did not check my airbnb message and did not communicate to the owner about the service animal."
