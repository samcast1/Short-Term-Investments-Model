Stayed with a pet",Great house and location. We were really looking forward to sleeping in and waking up to a nice peaceful morning but unfortunately the lawn maintenance people showed up around 7am and didn’t leave until about 10am. Not Amanda’s fault but we would have enjoyed a heads up because we likely would have stayed elsewhere so we could get some sleep.

Group trip","What a wonderful stay. Multiple bedroom with multiple bathrooms were perfect for a group of 5. The property is very private and has beautiful scenic views. Due to some issues during our trip (not involving the airbnb) the general consensus in the group was “if it wasn’t for the airbnb, this trip would’ve been a lot worse”. Plans are already being made to return to VA and have no plans to look at any other houses to stay at."

Stayed with kids","Amanda was a great host! Very responsive and helpful. Great location and spacious. I would respectfully recommend a deep clean as there was so much dust my family had a hard time with allergies. Dust on ceiling, light fixtures, ceiling fans, cobwebs everywhere, air return had a layer of dust. There is a wood burning stove so I can give it a pass somewhat due to that however maybe have housekeeping staff pay closer attention to detail. One of the showers was leaking and unable to use so that was a bit inconvenient as well."

Group trip","We booked this for a one-day stay for a funeral that we were attending. Amanda was fast at responding and getting us booked. Most Airbnbs won't let people stay for one night, so it was a blessing that she did allow this. The reason I gave this 3 stars was because of the unexpected fees and charges. The writeup on the website boasts a wood-burning fireplace and hot tub. However, there are EXTRA charges to use these amenities that aren't talked about until you arrive. After booking, I was asked how many guests and the arrival time. Our guest count went up by 3 due to more people attending the funeral. I updated Amanda on the 3 new guests. She stated she charges per guest and increased our cost $30 per guest.... Another SURPRISE charge. The house overall was good for our group of 7 adults. Hot showers and enough tableware. I asked for a later checkout, and Amanda did allow us to stay for an extra hour. I was thankful."

Group trip",Good place in a beautiful woods. Amanda has very detail instruction on the check in and out. We arrived in the mid of the night so it is easy to miss the entrance. But everything looks good in the house and beautiful view. Would recommend this house.

Group trip","My family stayed at Amanda’s home the night before my daughter’s exhausting college orientation. The home had great amenities and felt super cozy and cottage like. The hot tub and fire pit were so relaxing, and my 24-year-old daughter loved the swing! She hasn’t been on a swing in over a decade! The beds were comfy and clean. Amanda was very responsive and courteous. I wish we had stayed a second night. Loved the seclusion and family time! We will definitely stay at Amanda’s place when we visit our daughter in college next year!"

Stayed a few nights","The house was exactly what we were looking for. Quiet, out of the way, well kept and overall well equipped.
Amanda responded to our concerns immediately over our confusion in the listing over the hot tub being shared between 2 homes on the property, but with renters for the other home leaving as we arrived, it wasn't an issue.
Surrounded by nature, every day we spotted deer out in the yard, including a fawn with Mom and Dad.
Also having a GPS made the house easy to find, since it was rather remote.
Overall it was a pleasant stay, to wind down after exploring the area."

It was easy to check in and communicate with the host and the outdoor setting was even better than we were expecting. We really enjoyed the area around Blacksburg and Radford as well-we checked out Claytor Lake on bike and hiked Cascade Falls-both highly recommended. We hope to be back!

Stayed a few nights","Lovely place tucked into a grove of pine trees. Very quiet, peaceful, comfortable. It was well worth the value of the price we paid, which ended up being about the price of a local hotel room but we had the whole house!
We only used two of the 4 bedrooms so can vouch for 2 beds being comfortable. Bedroom decor a bit sparse, for things like a chair or place to hang clothes but nice sizes. Kitchen good, could use a couple other pots if you are people who cook like we are. But very generous with a full spice cabinet & condiments in the fridge that are so useful . Plenty of plates, glasses, mugs, silver ware basic kitchen utensils. Be patient with the burners if you are not used to electric so you do not burn food on to the pans. We enjoyed the outdoor fire pit. I had brought wood, especially kindling which I only use some of as there were enough logs and fallen twigs to make a very nice fire already there. Couches in the TV room comfortable, Living room comfortable. Enjoy your stay."

Stayed with kids","The house was a beautiful old English cottage with lots of rooms and space to gather. It had a great master bedroom suite with skylights. The grounds are nice and private and the kitchen was well stocked. We were staying there during the winter and only for one night, so didn't use the hot tub or fire pit, but they looked really nice. This airbnb shares the fire pit and hot tub with another airbnb on the property right next to the house, so this may not be the space for a private getaway, but there is enough room in the house to have your privacy. My partner and I both felt like it would be a great space to rent along with the neighboring airbnb, so you could have access to all the amenities and privacy. I'd definitely recommend it for a weekend away or a week enjoying some hikes in the Blue Ridge Mountains. This is a newer airbnb, so there were some kinks to work out, but Amanda was very responsive and appreciative of the feedback."

Stayed with kids","I definitely recommend this home and host! The location and space was perfect for us. We chose this location specifically because we had some places we wanted to go that weren’t far from it (ie: Virginia Safari Park), however we really enjoyed just hanging out at the house! We only stayed two nights and wished we booked it for longer! The back deck is spacious, there’s plenty of room in the yard for kids to run around and play (open grass + a trampoline!). The rooms were a great size and beds were all so comfy. There are two separate living room type areas which was so nice. One had a tv and plenty of seating for us to hang out together. The other room was nice for just enjoying some quiet time. We used the grill one night to make dinner, which was so convenient. Amanda was so responsive and made some great dining suggestions for us! Just know that this place is a little off the beaten path, so don’t be discouraged when you find everything is about 20 minutes away. It’s a beautiful, quick/easy drive out to the busier part of town where all the stores and restaurants are. Our favorite spot was “Our Daily Bread”, where we all had a delicious breakfast and great coffee! I’m going to keep this place saved so we can hopefully stay again sometime!"

There is no cell reception for T mobile and wifi is unreliable (connects and disconnects). Not a place you can work or connect to VPN. Also you have to take out the trash with you to about a mile and a half from the property which is a little inconvenient."

Stayed one night","It is hard for me to give our stay a low review because most everything went great and was all that we expected. As Anna states in the description, we were sharing walls with other guests. I was in my room with my teenager daughter. We went to sleep around 10 pm ironically when quiet hours were to start. Around 10:45 we were both awoken by morning and groaning of a woman and her partner in one of the other rooms. This went on for about an hour. I had to explain to my daughter what was going on. I know Anna can’t control this but it would definitely deter me for booking this place again.
In addition we could not find extra pillows and there did not seem to be enough power to work my hairdryer. It would come on for a second and quickly turn off."

Unit 3 was exactly as described and what I needed. Unit 4 has a view to the stream and woodland, and I have to say I do prefer that one.
Anna's place has a very private feel and is quite relaxing. There is no TV, but that is actually a welcome and rest inspiring relief.
Hope to stay again, as it was very near the training I was giving."

Stayed a few nights","We were very surprised at how comfortable and accommodating this small space was. We really enjoyed the view out the window of the horses across the street and loved walking by the stream in the back hearing so many different species of birds, including three different woodpeckers! The only real issue was that we were able to hear the people in the rooms that were next to us. We were prepared for that since it had been mentioned in other reviews. All in all, I thought the room was a great value and would definitely consider staying there again if we were in the area."

Check-in and check-out was the easiest I have ever experienced and I loved how organized everything was! This isn't a complaint about Airbnb, as it's not anything they did, but I would recommend bringing earplugs. Not everyone follows the quiet hour rules and the walls are very thin. Besides that, I really really loved this place. I definitely would like to come back again!!"

I realize this is not Anna's fault, but it really took away from the peacefulness of the place. Otherwise, I had everything I needed to be comfortable. P.S. There is no TV in the room.

Anna communicated well with us and made sure we had everything we needed during our stay. Fresh towels, soft linens, and few other things made our stay cozy. The area is quiet and a little remote but Anna's AirBnB makes it worth driving out away from the city to stay. 15-20 minutes drive to the heart of Blacksburg. She has several listings at the same location. One of those is a cute cabin with a canopy bed. We plan to reserve that one the next time we visit the area."

Stayed one night","Anna's place was clean, cozy, very cute and peaceful. I would absolutely stay there again! I came in late, after dark, and although it was in the country, and roads were a bit windy, it was not difficult to find with GPS. It had a great little set up, with nice amenities and was equipped with just about whatever you could need. The bed was very comfortable and for a small space, it seemed very spacious! I only wish I could have stayed longer to take a look around the property, in the daytime, as it seemed nicely landscaped with lots of pretty flowers, and it mentioned a creek. I definitely recommend Anna's place if you are in the area. Thank you Anna... and Billy for the stay in your lovely little AirBnB. You both were very kind, helpful, and accommodating with my communication needs. I really enjoyed my stay, even though it was short. I will hopefully be back again in my travels."

We got in kind of late so it was fine for us especially for the price. Walls are thin if you are picky about privacy keep in mind theres people right next to you and you can hear everything going on. Unfortunatley the people next to us were really loud all night. It was just one night so i didnt care but some people might have been upset and wanted more privacy. I REALLY suggest to buy bath mats for the shower and bathroom its very slippery. Someone might fall."

Good directions and super easy check in. The bathtub was large enough for a nice soak and lovely to find Epsom salts in the cupboard to add to the bath. The bed was comfy with nice linens and pillows. Kitchen was very small but well equipped. Only 3 things could have been better: a less noisy bathroom fan; a way to block the artificial security lights to promote peaceful sleep; and windows that opened (to hear those serenading frogs!). Overall, great place in a nice location for a decent price."

Amanda was an exceptional host, always friendly and proactive in providing restaurant recommendations. She even graciously accommodated a slightly later checkout for us. Without a doubt, I'll be booking this Airbnb again on my next visit to the area. Highly recommended!"

The townhouse is really wonderful and the beds are comfy. Everything is totally brand new!
GPS doesn't recognize the exact address but Amanda gives perfect directions and I'm sure this will be updated soon.

Chris was an amazing host and even let my family have a late check out at 2 pm when my daughter made finals on Sunday afternoon.

We really appreciated the house having both a pack-and-play crib and foldable high chair for our little guy, and are happy to report that they were both very clean and in perfectly safe condition.
The area is a great combination of close to downtown Blacksburg (10 minutes tops) for restaurants, shopping, and Virginia Tech events while being in a quiet and relaxing area where you don't have to worry about college kids partying until the wee hours of the night. We will certainly look to stay here the next time we visit Blacksburg. Thanks so much, Chris!"

Aaron reached out several times to ensure we got settled in and to make sure we knew where to find information. He was fantastic to work with.
The only thing I would caution on is the extra fees that are added to the per night cost. While the per night base cost is certainly worth it, there is an added cleaning fee, AirBNB fee and taxes that substantially increase the overall cost.
Otherwise, the home is beautiful and spacious and was the home away from home we needed! Go Hokies."

Stayed about a week","One of my very best Airbnb experiences an as an active “guest” since 2013 with 33 Airbnb stays. A great home with so many thoughtful touches! Wireless and wired charging for Apple and Android devices is provided. Apple TV connections in multiple rooms and keyless entry are great, a beautiful TV and sound system (ok geek speaking here). Tasteful decorations, a most comfortable couch and dining table for many, and outdoor seating on a secluded deck are provided. Super comfortable beds, a full kitchen with all the essentials from a multi-function coffee maker to many coffee mugs and wine glasses and plenty of dishes and silverware to cook (or re-heat your takeout). A washer, dryer and dishwasher to boot for “busy guests”.
The location in Blacksburg is most convenient, with a bus stop right out front and walking distance to all city and university locations that matter. Plenty of free onsite and street parking.
Add to that a most responsive host to any inquiries and you have a perfect stay with a true “Superhost” in every sense of the word, thank you Aaron!"

The home was nicely decorated yet comfortable enough for us to relax. I was especially pleased with the well-stocked kitchen and was able to make my daughter a nice home-cooked meal when she dropped by. The home was close enough for us to walk to an evening basketball game yet far enough away that we didn’t feel like we were in the midst of the college scene. We would absolutely stay here again.

Stayed with kids","Aaron’s communication is superb. Before and right after booking, we were able to communicate about specific needs of my group event. Our family was having a reunion in Blacksburg and needed a wheelchair accessible property for the first floor, and this property fit the bill! The zero entry front door and wide walkways made it easy. At the last minute, my child became sick and we couldn’t attend. Since the cancellation policy was nonrefundable at that point, Aaron permitted other family members of mine (who I trust!!) to stay there. They got into town early and we were able to communicate quickly with Aaron, who verified that the cleaning crew had just left and let them check in early. My family members reported that the house was very clean, spacious, and a great location (~20 mins walking to downtown, 5 minutes away by car to the VT bookstore, etc). They said they really enjoyed the home gym and were glad he provided so many towels! The only caution is that the staircase doesn’t have any blockings between the treads (gives it a half-floating look with an attached railing on one or both sides) so it might not be the safest for small children or elderly adults, but nothing that the use of caution couldn’t fix!"

The space is modern, while still maintaining a homey feel. We have really appreciated having a full kitchen, all the bathroom essentials, and a washer/dryer available. Aaron's hospitality is easily among the best we have encountered while staying in Airbnbs. Not only did he agree to host us this time at the very last minute, but he even made changes to his schedule to accommodate us. His cleaner was equally hospitable, preparing the place for us in record time. We cannot thank Aaron enough for his kindness, and we highly recommend his place to anyone visiting the area!"

Stayed a few nights","The description of this rental is perfect, inside and out! Not only is the apartment clean, spacious, and comfortable, the adjoining backyard is beautiful! The skylights allowed plenty of sunlight (beware if you wake to light as you will be seeing the sunlight at first light). It was a perfect alarm for us. The hosts were generous with their amenities as coffee, tea, and water was provided as well as use of dishes and utensils.
The only concerns I would mention is that is is an upstairs unit and the shower is very tight, so if you have mobility issues or are very tall this unit might pose challenges.
I highly recommend a stay here for those who want a peaceful and relaxing stay!"

Make sure you try out the Wine Lab on the edge of Campus. One word of caution the ceiling in the bathroom does slip down where the toilet is and my 6’4 ft husband did hit his head a couple of times.

The little bouquets the hosts had in the room were a lovely touch, and they checked in periodically to make sure I had everything I needed. Otherwise, I had perfect privacy, and an ideal space to relax in."

Stayed a few nights","We (me, my husband and our 4 year old son) traveled to Blacksburg for VA tech graduation weekend. This suite significantly exceeded our expectations. The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful, and the setting around the house itself is beautiful with nice flowers, trees, etc. Bryan and his family are such thoughtful hosts. We arrived to find that they had placed some toys, puzzles and books in the suite for our 4 year old to enjoy. The suite is beautifully decorated and very clean. Bryan even had some water and other beverages ready for us in the mini fridge, as well as coffee and tea. He also included some Aveda toiletries in the bathroom. The rest of my family was staying in a hotel nearby and came by to check it out as we raved about the place - they loved it too! Bryan and his wife even offered us some donuts and our son played with his kids for a bit before we headed back home. This was a great stay in a beautiful place with very nice, responsive and considerate hosts. Highly recommend it!"

Stayed a few nights","Bright and Sunny as advertised! Nice to wake up to a sun filled room. When looking for a clean and quiet place to stay while in the Burg, this is the place. The location is far enough from the apartment complexes so you do not hear the late night parties, but still less than 5 min. from campus and about 2 min. from the Carol Lee Donut Shop if you time the stoplight right. You have that large hotel suite feel, with a separate hallway with frig, coffee pot, tea kettle and counter space, and private bathroom off that hallway, separate from the bed room and lounging area. The main room, in addition to the bed has enough room to comfortably include a desk/chair, couch and high back chair. The kids mentioned in the description were around my first day but if I hadn’t actually seen them, I would not have known they were on the property."

We also had our own guaranteed off street parking space which was nice, and everything we needed inside to be completely comfortable.

Stayed with a pet","For a quick stay in Blacksburg to catch a basketball game and visit our student, this listing fit our needs (2 adults). As you can see from the photos, it's essentially an efficiency apartment with the front door opening right near the foot of the bed. This is located directly under the main house so you may hear/see the owners - but generally felt private. It's rare to have a full kitchen in spaces like this, so that is a nice bonus and was part of our decision to stay there. Also very dog friendly which meant we didn't have to board our pet. The fair pricing was another reason we chose to stay here over other options."

The yard area was beautiful with lots of room for Zeke to zoom around (much needed after being in the car so long). I was blessed with all the extra thoughtful touches Theresa supplied and the clear instructions on the frig. I have already scheduled my next stay at Theresa's. Thank you Theresa for providing such a wonderful oasis of rest.
Kindly,
Robin and Zeke"

Probably a better stay for VT fans and not tired travelers. I didn’t see any complaints in other reviews so the pros outweigh the cons.
Lots of lovely touches to make it feel homey ."

Directions to enter the space seemed a little complicated over written word, but it was exactly as stated and super easy! We arrived at night and the pathway was well lit. I was very impressed when we opened the door. It is a very cute place! Well decorated and had absolutely everything we could need for our short visit. It was clean and fresh looking. All necessary items available in the bathroom and the kitchen was stocked with a generous coffee bar. Bed was very comfortable. They even had an extra space with a desk/vanity. I just wish we could have stayed longer! Can't wait to book here again!"

Stayed with a pet","Hands down, one of the best air BNB’s we’ve ever stayed in. Everything about it was 5 STAR worthy. It was an easy walk to campus if we wanted or needed to which, if you’re familiar with Blacksburg, is a bonus especially since the town has now implemented the town parking permit policy. Sigh. Theresa’s place had everything we needed to survive for an endless amount of time. Just add food. Having three larger dogs, this place was ideal for us with its extremely large fenced in backyard. And because Theresa also has dogs, it became immediately clear that they were as welcome as we were. I think what we liked most about this place was that we immediately felt right at home. The random Virginia Tech Hokie decor inside and out was exactly what Hokie alumni look for when they come back to Blacksburg to visit. Oh and, there were tissues, the only place that’s ever provided them. Absolutely everything was fantastic! We wanted to stay forever. We would definitely s†ay here again in the future."

They were responsive, proactive, and well-prepared for dogs (including poop bags, outdoor trash, water bowls, easy-to-wash linens, etc). The area is close to shopping, Starbucks, and not too far from the highway which I also appreciated. If we were in the area, I would stay here again."

The apartment had everything you would need and even more amenities as you look around. Two notes for this location. First, as Theresa mentions you will hear noise from upstairs as they move around; bring ear plugs if you like to sleep past 7am. The second is the vinyl flooring is slippery when just wearing socks."

Stayed a few nights","Tucked away in the bottom level of a home, this unit was very thoughtfully designed and had everything in it that you could think of. It's quiet and you can get a good night rest while there. Occassionaly we heard footsteps upstairs above us the morning we slept in, but nothing that would prevent us from renting again! (Plus we were forewarned about that and possibly hearing a dog - which we never heard bark ever!) Love the little patio area. Super comfy chairs so that we worked outside on the pub table. Extra touches inside such as a Brita water filter, coffee pods, tea and chocolates was SO welcome! We appreciated the full size body wash, shampoo and conditioner AND even body lotion. I absolutely hate the small travel size shampoos etc. Small backroom with bench, make up table and shelving was SO nice as a changing area and make-up table. Hair dyer, iron, even band aids were there if we needed! Super close to campus and nice quiet location. Will come back for sure!"

Stayed with a pet","Honestly this was such a perfect stay , it made us so happy.
The yard is gorgeous. It is fully fenced in and it is huge! Our two dogs had the time of their lives in the yard. It was honestly so beautiful seeing them running around and enjoying it so much.
The house itself is also very nice. Not only is it a beautiful carefully designed house but also it had everything you could think of. Theresa even had contact lense solution available should you need one.
I loved the dehumidifier, the fan and the AC in the room. It made our sleep very comfortable. The bed felt great after a long day hiking.
I would honestly come back to Blacksburg just to stay in this Airbnb!
What made everything even better was how pet-friendly and kind the hosts were. We were worried our dogs would be barking when we left them to do our own stuff, and Theresa and her husband said “let dogs be dogs” and honestly this peace of mind made everything so much better.
Thank you for a perfect stay!"

Her check-in instructions and how to get to the unit were very simple and easy to follow. The amount of thought she has placed into making this space feel like home is unmatched. I loved this little space. My only caution is that it gets bright in the mornings in this unit, so bring a eye mask. I will slo make note that you can hear people or the dogs upstairs from time to time. Otherwise, the noise settles pretty early in the day, so that wasn't an issue for me. This little unit had pretty much everything you need. The location was perfect as it was only a few minutes drive, or walk, to several restaurants, grocery stores, and Virginia Tech's Campus."

Loved the paw sign you hang when your dog is using the backyard, so the owner of the property would wait to put her dogs out. So considerate!
The bed was really comfortable & getting to watch the NCAA tournament there was a bonus for us.
We will be back when spending
time at Virginia Tech!

I only stayed the night so didn’t spend a ton of time but it was very comfortable and convenient for getting to restaurants and campus. Only thing to note is that it’s a basement unit so you will hear footsteps. They were quiet by 10pm though. I expected that so no complaints here but don’t book it if hearing footsteps above you will upset you."

Stayed one night","My wife stayed at Theresa's twice in February and says:
“During Covid, I have been driving back and forth along I-81 regularly. Theresa's Place has been an ideal spot for an overnight on my way. It is clean, nicely and comfortably furnished, easy to find, quiet and private, and near places to pick up a quick supper. I am glad to have found it as an ideal economical place to rest for the night and go on my way the next day. Important to me is that its air supply is independent from the main house so you are not sharing air with anyone in another household.
Since the apartment has a kitchen and a nice patio facing the backyard, it would be a good place to stay for more than a night if that was your need.
I wasn't traveling with our dog, but Theresa is welcoming of dogs and has a fenced yard off the patio that you can use.”"
