Stayed with kids","The updated farmhouse was beautifully redone in both rustic and modern touches. It was great having two full bathrooms, and the bedrooms were very spacious. The kitchen was fully stocked and had all the essentials one would need for cooking. My husband and I played one of the provided board games after our daughter went to bed, which was nice. It's close to Ricketts Glen, which is beautiful! We stayed for a birthday trip to Knoebels, which is about 40 minutes away. I wish it was a tad closer, as I was hoping for a place that was 30 minutes max, but I'm still extremely happy with our stay here and will definitely be back and have already recommended it to family and friends!
Dave and his wife were very responsive and friendly and even offered nearby playgrounds for our young daughter, which was so nice. They are both great hosts and will do well in the Airbnb community. Thank you for having us and for opening your wonderful home to us, and thank you for being great hosts!"

Stayed with a pet",Wonderful host. The home is a farmhouse that is very beautiful and well taken care of. The view of the mountains in the dining room and master bedroom is absolutely breathtaking. The location is peaceful. The home is fully equipped with everything you may need. The home is clean and feels like you are right at home. Overall we had a great experience. It is a great location and not far from Rickets Glen state park. My family and I were well accommodated. We will differently be back.

Group trip",We had the best stay at Janette’s place! The place was just as pictured. Janette had everything we needed and even added some special items like the cookies and flavored creamers. She was very thoughtful. The home was immaculate and sits on a beautiful property. We enjoyed our coffee on the chairs out back with a view of the lake. So peaceful. We felt very comfortable and safe. Janette also gave us a great spot for food and ice cream. We will definitely be staying at Janette’s again in the future. PS her place is only 10 min from Knoebels!

Immaculately clean house. Perfect for accessing Bloomsburg and University activities.
Janette is a thoughtful and welcoming host. Beds were very comfortable and there is plenty of room to relax. Each room has independent temperature control which was a plus for our family. Well stocked kitchen.

Walks around the property are very peaceful and there is a lot of wildlife to observe. The clearly marked walking paths along the property take you very close to the side of the river. We definitely plan to return in the future.

Group trip","Although a bit secluded, the individualized instructions were perfect. Close enough to town for food yet far enough away it comfortable country living. Such great hiking and trails for a brisk walk and see nature. We saw deer come almost up to the property one morning. Great stay for my daughter to spend her sweet 16 birthday party with a few friends. They got their money's worth out of the hot tub! Very well stocked kitchen and tons of blankets for the cool PA evenings. Thanks for a great couple of nights!"

Stayed a few nights","I stayed with my family (four people total) for a couple nights during the holidays as a little getaway to get spend some quality time together out in nature. Chris’ place was AMAZING! True to all the photos, listed amenities, and the glowing reviews- this house is stocked with everything you need to have a comfortable stay (kitchen supplies, extra blankets, linens, clean towels and washcloths, tp, etc). You can immediately sense the love and care in the home! Design details are classy, the views beautiful, and the surrounding area of the house is very serene. It is the perfect combo with modern amenities yet out in nature! It was pretty rainy most of the time we were there but we enjoyed the coziness of the home and the hot tub (wonderful in the cold weather especially!!). The property was very clean, and felt safe. And Chris is an excellent host! Overall, it was a wonderful stay! Highly recommend booking this space. My family and I are already planning to return again sometime! :)"

Stayed a few nights","This was the perfect getaway! We wanted privacy and we found it! The setting is wonderful. Secluded but easy to access property. As hunters, we thoroughly enjoyed walking the property and seeing all the deer sign. We were even blessed with seeing deer on the way in the driveway, and deer at the hot tub on our last morning! The home was perfect. So clean and organized and everything you need is there. We felt right at home immediately. While there are many things to do nearby, we wanted to be away from it all - and we were! The kitchen was fantastic. We had everything we needed to cook all our meals. We truly look forward to going there again soon. Chris was a wonderfully responsive host and made sure we had all the information we needed. I also had some work to do while I was there and had no issues videoconferencing with the wifi. Highly recommend this host and this property!"

Stayed a few nights","The Sun Tower is a fantastic place to stay when in the Bloomsburg area. It sparkling clean, a fully equipped kitchen, two large bedrooms and great outdoor balconies off the kitchen downstairs and the bedrooms upstairs. We sat outside each evening and listened to the birds while enjoying an adult beverage. While pulling in, a family of turkeys, a family of deer, and some rabbits, welcomed us to the property. It is about as private as you can get situated on 60 acres with no other houses in sight but still a short drive into Bloomsburg. We will definitely stay at the Sun Tower again the next time we are in the area."

This place is exactly what you see in the photo’s completely secluded and peaceful, which was definitely needed for my friends because when the wine gets going we can get a little noisy lol. Highly recommend a weekend stay to get away from the city. I will be looking forward to going back this summer. He was also flexible with extending the check out time but “don’t quote me” as I can see this place being booked up in the warmer seasons! Thanks Chris!
There was even merch available such as dad hats, and mugs which we thought was a cute touch!"

We loved playing the square wooden game, but had to search online for instructions to figure out. Small suggestion to provide ☺️

The cleanliness of the Sun Tower when we arrived was unmatched. Perfection.
The Sun Tower is extremely private and secluded which is exactly what we were looking for, and Chris' instructions made it easy to get to. The amenities were over the top (three different ways to make coffee?!), smart TVs to cast to, outdoor heater, hammock, the two decks were awesome, just everything was so great.
My wife and I have been airbnbing for 4-5 years now, and this was hands down one of our favorite stays. We'd absolutely want to come back in the future, and we wish we could have stayed longer."

This was a great location for a hiking trip we planned to Ricketts Glen, which is approximately 35 minutes away from the Suntower.

If you are looking for peace and quiet, this is the place. The driveway is a gravel/dirt road and we have a FWD and had no problems, but we did not have any heavy rain so we cannot attest to that.
We are aviation enthusiasts so it was fun to watch the small planes on their approach into Bloomsburg airport from the porch. Close to town and most attractions. Knoebels was awesome as was the Coal Mine/Steam Train tour in Ashland (do not wear good shoes and be sure to bring a jacket). If you are a cat lover, there is a place called ""Cats in Bloom"" in town and you can go in and mingle with cats, really cool concept to help them find homes.
HIGHLY recommend and we will be back!! Thank you."

We had plenty of room for the kids to hand out between games of their soccer tournament. The game room was a big hit!"

You are in the mountains with nothing around but nature. All you need to bring is some K cups of your favorite coffee for the morning and nothing like sitting out on the deck with a fresh hot cup of coffee. Or Dunkin is about a 7 min drive. Picked up some burgers and hotdogs and grilled was perfect. I will 100% be back this summer for a little weekend getaway.

Stayed a few nights","Our second time back to the fire tower in October and we talked about making it an annual tradition. This time we combined celebrating our 9th wedding anniversary and a mini-babymoon since our first child is due January 2024. Had another great stay and enjoyed some local food (Big Dan’s BBQ and Brewski’s were favorites). Although I couldn’t partake in wine this trip, we both really enjoyed Fero Winery when we visited last year so stopped to stock up on favorite varietals while we were up here.
A few recommendations for a few things for guests to bring to make your stay even better: if you like to read at night but your partner likes to go to sleep, consider bringing a book light, or even a small lamp or candles for mood lighting in the bedroom since there’s only 1 panel switch for all of upstairs and the lights are very and not dimmable. Bring a reusable K cup for those who prefer using their own coffee grounds. And supplies for s’mores because the fire pit will call to you!"

Stayed a few nights","Stayed at the Firetower for a few days to celebrate my husband’s 30th birthday. Every day we marveled at how perfect this place is! Secluded feel but crazily only 5-10 minutes to groceries, restaurants, and whatever other supplies you might need. We didn’t explore the town too much other than to grab groceries & go golfing one of the days - we spent most of our time at the place playing games (ones we brought & yard games that are provided!), enjoying the bonfire, strolling around the property, and savoring the slow pace at the cabin.
I watched the sunrise from the balcony every morning, wrapped in a blanket with my tea in hand. It was spectacular. One morning I was even joined by a family of deer grazing near the yard!
Chris has thought of everything to make the Firetower comfortable & inviting.
My ONLY advice is if you’re a light sleeper, bring earplugs - the upstairs heater is loud when it turns on in the silence of night! Luckily we didn’t need the heat up there.
We’ll be back!"

Definitely was what I needed. Thank you Chris for your quick responses and offering this place for stays. I would love here if I could!!"

Stayed a few nights","My fiancé and I like to get away around our anniversary, and we love the mountains and nature. We happened across Chris’s listing of his absolutely gorgeous Fire Tower, and we were instantly intrigued. From the time we walked in the front door, we felt an immediate sense of relaxation and connection to nature. This spot is very private (which we very much prefer), and the entire time we were there, it felt like we had the entire mountain to ourselves! Chris was a fantastic host, making sure that everything was clear, that the listing was accurate, that the house was spotless, and that we had everything we needed. This is my favorite place that we have picked to vacation, and I really mean that. I absolutely love it up there. We will be booking a little after Christmas to experience it in the winter, and we’re super excited to go back. We’ve been home for 12 hours, and we’re both missing it already. If you’re thinking about booking and you like nature, do it. You will not regret it!"

Stayed a few nights","A memory made for a lifetime. My partner and I had a beautiful stay. It was a lovely space in the woods with an unreal view. I was still in such a good mood when I returned home. It gets toasty which I loved. We played the couples game and a little guitar . We watched cartoons and relaxed. The kitchen is stocked, fridge is clean . He even had old bay seasoning :). It took me a little to get comfy bc I am a city girl and you are REALLY out in the woods and there is a small chain on the door and no blinds on the windows which my city mind had to reconcile. My bf however slept fine ! There is heat in the bathroom++! That was the best thing besides the view for me. Water was warm in shower with good pressure. Bed was comfy. If you are a light sleeper the heater being above you makes little noises so we had to turn it off. Also if you can avoid going at night time get there while there is daylight. It is a little daunting in the dark. Chris letting us use the trunk was a heaven sent"

He was incredibly accommodating and informative about his property. His guidebook listed on his airbnb page is filled with local attractions, it’s worth looking at.

This trip was a getaway for us as a couple, but we have a nursing baby, so she tagged along. If you're in our situation and wondering if a place like this will work for you, come! You could easily fit a pack n play in that second floor bedroom, or you could fit a pack n play in the loft, which is what we did (our baby is only just learning how to crawl and can't pull to stand, which is why that was a safe option for us). We loved going on a hike on the grounds, reading, playing games, using the camp fire; it was so wonderful and relaxing."

They had so much fun exploring the fire tower and especially loved the loft. They also loved playing outside, sitting in the hammock and swinging chair, and having snacks on the balcony. We walked the trails on the property a bit and looked for Bigfoot (their idea ;) ). They were also excited about the candy jars on the counter. As far as us parents are concerned, it was a wonderful getaway - even better than pictured if that’s possible. The views were gorgeous. The property was easy to find as the instructions were very good. Would definitely recommend this property."

Stayed a few nights","Chris's Fire Tower is an amazing stay experience. You wake up every morning to a beautiful sunrise over the mountains and the sounds of birds chattering, and then there is ample space in the surrounding grounds for a stroll. The kitchen has all the essentials, the bed is comfy, and the shower is spacious. But the draw is really the uniqueness of the space and the beauty of the surroundings. You're in Bloomsburg but feel much more isolated up in the tower. Only thing to note is that there aren't blinds on most of the windows, so just be aware of that beforehand. Overall one of my best Airbnb experiences, and would definitely book again."

Chris provides all essentials for a relaxing, eat in, getaway. We visited in the winter, and had no trouble accessing the cabin with our Subaru. It was too cold to sit outside in one of the many sitting areas or fire pit, but we did some hiking around the grounds. Chris includes games, coloring books, and tv with plenty of channels to occupy guests inside. He was easy to contact if needed, and check in and check out were simple and contactless.

Stayed a few nights","Staying at the Firetower was an unforgettable experience. The silence of the seclusion mixed with the gorgeous setting with a warm, cozy, and perfect base was an experience I had never anticipated.
Chris's listing and messages had let us know ahead of time that we would most likely need a car with AWD to get to the chalet. Unfortunately, the car we planned to borrow fell through at the last second and we decided to risk it.... we did not make it farther than the farm house in my tiny coup.
LUCKILY Chris was incredibly responsive to my messages, and allowed us to borrow a truck that had been parked right there. After moving our things to the truck and making our way up, we were pretty cold but in high spirits. The moment we turned the corner and saw the firetower in person, we were in a new world.
Stepping inside, the tower was already so warm and inviting. We left our things in the car for a few minutes just to enjoy the space. When we made our way upstairs, the bed faces an all window/door wall with views over the mountains. It absolutely took my breath away. We came and stayed while it was snowing and cold, and I spent a significant amount of my time walking the 360 deck just having my breath taken away.
The firetower had everything we needed and more. We had brought half our kitchen and appliances with us, which turned out to be completely unnecessary. Everything was well stocked with cooking ingredients, games to play, supplies, and so many odds and ends that ended up coming in handy (that ball of string came in clutch!).
My partner and I had an absolutely rejuvenating experience staying here, and we hope to continue to return for years to come."

The house was clean and organized when we arrived, including clean towels, sheets, fully equipped kitchen, and toys for the kids. There were plenty of bedrooms and space to accommodate our party of 5 adults and 2 small children.
The WiFi was somewhat difficult to access, since the password listed on the AirBnB app did not work the first night. Danielle got back to us and fixed the issue the next morning. Although the upstairs does have great central AC, the basement that had 1 bedroom and kids beds did not have central AC and was quite muggy. There was an AC window unit in the basement bedroom, but we could not use it at night because it would be too loud to hear our small kids if they needed us in the next room over. We did notice central heat in the basement so it could be different in cooler months."

Home was in a cul de sac so it was very private. Everything in the home was up to date and very well kept. We had a small issue with plumbing but the host addressed the issue. She had almost everything you could think of in the home for us to use. One draw back is almost all the windows have no treatments so there’s no privacy at night. While it is beautiful to look out it makes it difficult with littles as they are up early and makes naps difficult. We stayed here as we went to knoebels for the weekend and for my sons birthday. The drive was very reasonable at 21 minutes. Would definitely recommend! Thanks again for your hospitality!!

When I called Colleen she was apologetic and she called back to let me know there had been a miscommunication with the cleaning person. She made amends and we stayed the night.

Wanda and her family have created a great family space and are generously sharing it with lucky visitors. It comes complete with a switch labeled ""deer spotlight"" which we flipped the last evening and looked out the window, and sure enough there was a couple deer out in the yard.
Internet was a bit touch-and-go, so more of a get-away than a working hub, although we made it work and was able to video conference from the cabin."

This was by far my family’s favorite place and we are already planning another peaceful getaway. The cabin is built beautifully and is squeaky clean. It has every amenity you can think of if you’re a mom like me and might have forgotten something. I needed a nice quiet birthday getaway from the city where I could clear my head while also providing entertainment for my 4 year old son and this space provided that and more! Wanda has thought of every detail and her home was very accommodating. This cabin is very kid friendly as they have so many things to offer, my son played for hours and hours. The views were spectacular and the fire pit was beautiful and they provided the firewood. The playground was a solid winner that any child would enjoy. The main bedroom and whirlpool made us adults admire it even more. From easy check in and great response I wish I could give more than 5 stars! Thank you!"

Stayed with kids","Wanda's place was more than one could ask for. I can't think of anything that she forgot.
Spotless throughout the home.
I brought my grandsons to Knoebels for a couple of days and this is where we called home during our stay. My younger grandsons both age 8 loved the toys and games that she had there to occupy them. Along with the playground.
My teenage grandsons also
enjoyed their time at Wanda's. They loved the views and the cows right across the street. They took many photos of the cows. 😊
Just swinging on the porch swing and relaxing while enjoying the quietness and scenery made two teenage boys happy!
Although it was a quick visit and much to do while at Knoebels, we all had a relaxing stay while at Wanda's.
I have stayed at many Airbnb's, but nothing can compare to our stay here. We give Wanda's place a 5 +
Would definitely stay here again.
Thank you for notifying us so quickly that Evie had been left behind. We were able to turn around to pick her up. 💕"

My husband, son and in-laws joined me. This was the cleanest most well stocked place I've ever stayed. Wanda is top notch. She has anything and everything you need. Just bring clothes, food, and yourself. The rest is there. Everything is labels. And so many things you'd never expect an airbnb to have but would need. Spices, batteries, pens, coffee, all the pots and pans you can think of needed. Not to mention all the activities that were there for my 2 year old son. The train table was his favorite but he enjoyed the store and diner as well. Plus the toys upstairs too we're a huge hit. He loves the foosball table as well. My son loved the swing set and played on it often! The weather was perfect for us while there in November. It was unseasonably warm but we appreciated it. It was a wonderful stay and I would 100% go back. My MIL has already said she wanted to return for another trip next year! Wanda, you've outdone yourself.

Stayed with kids","WOW. We’ve stayed at countless Airbnbs over the last six years but this was our favorite stay. We went during peak fall foliage and hallo-fun at Knoebles. My kids (2&4) loved the fossil dig too. But honestly we could’ve stayed at the Airbnb all three nights. The place has so much to offer: beautiful fire pit, view of the stars, wildlife, playground, giant playroom in basement located right next to fire pit so kids can play inside while you prep the fire. My son has an autoimmune disease so cleanliness is always a top priority. This place was SPOTLESS and deep cleaned unlike many other places we’ve stayed in the past that we had to clean ourselves before unpacking. The kitchen was stacked and we prepped all of our meals at home. A highlight for us was playing grocery store for hours with our two kids and watching the sunrise and some deer on the back porch. The jet tub also has a 360 view of the fall foliage. The flow of this house is amazing for people with kids— it’s so open that if you have shadows who follow your every move like our kids they’ll feel comfortable and safe like ours did. If you’re a nervous over packer parent come here and pack less. No need to pack toys, booster seats, baby gates, playpen, baby monitor, white noise or fans. All were provided. Hosts have thought of everything to make a family’s stay comfortable and it shows."

It is well stocked with the basic kitchen amenities and clean linens and towels so we were never short for anything. The assortment of games for all ages from small children to adults for both inside and outside gave us plenty to choose from when we needed an activity to do. The views from this mountain top are spectacular and the cabin has lots of windows to view the wildlife from and enjoy the scenery. When I contacted Wanda with any questions both before we arrived and while we were staying she replied in a very timely manner.

Hosting more people there’s extra tables and chairs. In all this place was so amazing for 2 families with kids. I feel i got very lucky how great this place was. I would recommend to anyone. Half hour to Walmart which isn’t bad. Half hour to knobles you just can’t beat this place. Price was amazing very fair. If I could move here I would.

We wish we had done the escape room to learn more about the property.
Slept well but as a heads up, if you are a light sleeper, pack earplugs. You are on a downtown street. One of us was unfazed the other was a light sleeper who always packs ear plugs and was prepared. It worked out fine.
Comfortable and lovely space."

Since she will also be a student-athlete we know we will be coming back to Bloomsburg quite a bit to watch her over the years so we needed to find a suitable location to stay at.
Russell's apartment couldn't have been a better selection for us. Beautiful, historic, and yet very modernized. The apartment was immaculate, and the location was right in the heart of town. The beds were also SUPER comfy!
We will definitely be back!

We were in town for the Memorial of our sister, and it was nice to find this clean, roomy & comfortable airbnb. It was a nice oasis under our circumstances. Enjoyed the apartment escape room mystery game, it was fun & challenging!
Great location, enjoyed walking around the historic neighborhood drinking Bubble Tea. We were able to find free & close parking on Jefferson St. for both our vehicles, no problem. We could see our cars from the game room window too. 3 miles away is an overnight electric car charging station, that we used for our rental. Main St. Parking meters are the cheapest🤫 I ever seen at .25 cents per half hour, 2hrs for $1.00!
The beds are so extremely comfortable & plush, we would love to come again! Thank you Russell & Mandy!"

However, the location and the instructions were great. The only issue I had was street noise. This property is on Main St. and it got fairly loud during the day, especially with the weather turning and all the bikers hitting the main drag. But, if you're not trying to day sleep, this was a perfect location. Much larger than anticipated, as well. I would stay here again."

I was in town for a wedding and had some family over beforehand and they could not stop talking about how impressed they were with the place. We opted to do the immersive experience and I’m so glad we did! Mandy and Russell responded so quickly, and even stayed up late so they could give us our extra hints for the escape room (which was insane and so much fun—we got a late start and were dead set on figuring out the story). This has been the best Airbnb experience I’ve had to this date. I cannot recommend staying with Mandy and Russell enough."

Stayed with a pet","I can’t say enough about this Airbnb. there’s so many great little features that really capture the historic, Victorian style building, with some new age touches. The renovation was so tastefully done to create a romantic & cozy, yet modern vibe. I was living for the lighting, high ceilings, and textures.
This rental would be great for a couple, family, or a few friends for a weekend getaway. Especially since it’s dog friendly, and has a fenced back yard! Such a fun idea they’ve created with their immersive experience. Initially, we had no idea that was included with our stay, and we can’t thank them enough for the experience we had.
These host outdid themselves with this place. We had no idea that such a hidden gem was located in this town."

Stayed a few nights","To sum it up in one word: WOW!
In many words: Ignoring the unique escape room experience for a sec….the Airbnb itself was fantastic! I did not realize how absolutely gigantic the place was going to be. It was very well done and everything was very comfortable! They had about anything you could need and we spent a long time playing arcade games.
As for the escape room experience, there’s just some final touches to be put on it but anyone who likes escape rooms is going to have a blast. I’ve never heard of such a unique experience before and we had a great time doing it. The only downside of that experience is that you don’t get to experience it again if you stay more than once. But the Airbnb stands well on its own without the cherry on top immersive experience!"

Note that you do need to keep close to young kids bc there is a sloping hill leading to a pond behind the house. We saw ducks and bullfrogs! Everything was well maintained, and Melody even left us paper products when the dishwasher broke! She also quickly responded when we realized a fuse had blown from a storm the night before. We will come back again!"

Loved the isolated feeling away from hustle and bustle but very close to all we needed and wanted to do. Melody was very responsive and was great to work with. I highly recommend this place. It is a wonderful farmhouse that for us brought back some good family memories of being on the farm. The downstairs provided a lot of space for our family to visit. It was a wonderful experience.

Group trip","Firstly, let me say how beautiful and private Hidden Acres was. We were in the area for Knoebel’s and chose Hidden Acres for the country setting and abundance of space. We had 8 adults in our group and had plenty of space to spread out and enjoy our family weekend. The beds were super comfy and everything was so clean! We really enjoyed hanging out on the wrap around porch late into the night catching up with the family. The communication with Melody was by far the best we have had with any Air BnB rental thus far. Melody was quick to respond and very helpful and accommodating. She left extra pillows out and even recommended the room that had the firmest bed after I mentioned my recent neck surgery and possible needs. There is just nothing like the charm and feel of a 1900’s farm house, but of course having the amenities like air conditioning, internet and tv we all crave now days. Hidden Acres is at the top on our list if we plan another trip to Knoebel’s in the future!"

Though they did have wifi access that we used on a brought laptop to stream a sports game one night. The house came equipped with everything incedental you needed, dollar general is just a bit aways off the mountain for things you may need, and food delivery was timely if you don't wish to cook. The property itself is beautiful, we spent sometime walking around, and avoiding the no-go zones. Will absolutely check if this space is open first next time we are in the area!"
