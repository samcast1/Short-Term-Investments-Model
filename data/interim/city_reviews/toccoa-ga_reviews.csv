Group trip","We rented this place for my son’s graduation from Toccoa Falls College. It perfectly accommodated our extended family. We enjoyed kayaking off the dock. The house has everything you need and the decor is gorgeous! The beds are comfortable and there is so much space for gathering together. If this place is available, I highly suggest booking it ASAP as there are not a lot of other options of this quality in the area. Thank you for a wonderful experience for our family!"

Stayed a few nights","We loved the cabin and the area, especially the water.
We arrived after a long drive in the afternoon, got in easily and felt right at home.
We chose to spend more time at the cabin than we had planned, only because we felt on a real vacation. Very relaxing and comfortable. Used the kayaks every day.
Highly recommend this place - you will love it!"

Group trip","This place is terrific. It’s beautifully maintained and in a private, peaceful setting. We had a terrific time. The dock, large deck, screened-in porch, and guest house with a pool table offer a bunch of different options for relaxing and hanging out. Nicest Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in and the hosts were terrific as well."

Stayed with kids","This place was heavenly! One of my favorite things to do with our kids when they have a few days off school is find a lake or mountain cabin and disconnect for a few days. All that to say, we’ve experienced quite a lot of these kinds of airbnbs and this one was definitely in our top favorites of all time! It was clean, BEAUTIFULLY decorated and completely stocked with everything we could need. It feels very private without being isolated. The lake was great! We enjoyed taking the kayaks out and relaxing on the peaceful waters. The screened-in porch was perfection. No bugs, SO much furniture and dining space! The game cabin with pool table was AMAZING!! Highlight of the trip, especially since my teenager slept out there (which was his idea of heaven). Oh, and the LIGHTING! I can’t even begin to describe how lovely the lighting is in this home. I’m sensitive to lights and have never stayed in a rental that has so many dimmer switches! Can’t wait to come back and stay longer!"

Group trip","Such a beautiful place. The beds were very comfortable, the kitchen was well stocked with all the essentials (even some ziplocks and tin foil). We were easily able to cook, do laundry, and dishes. The design and decoration of the house is very conducive to relaxing. The lake/cove was a little low during our visit, but that didn't stop us from enjoying the beauty. We enjoyed the nearby waterfalls (Ana Ruby, Minnehaha, Tallulah Falls...missed out on Taccoa waterfall..next time), the city of Helen and Mountain Coaster, and even Ziplining. Having a nice grocery store and some restaurants/fast food (Chick fil A/Starbucks) not too far was a plus. My teenage daughters enjoyed walking around outside, the bench swing, and our visits with the sweetest fur-neighbor ""Whiskey"". We were sad to leave."

Stayed with kids","The house is as described. Very well stocked with everything you will need. The only big down fall is the water level was extremely low and we were unable to use the dock, kayaks and paddle boat. Would rent again. Located center of a ton of waterfalls and state parks. Our 2 families loved the adventure of hiking to see waterfalls! Thank you for amazing hidden gem. Just wish the water levels would have been up. Wi-Fi was nonexistent for us. But had workers out working on lines all around the house. They may have been the issue But we spent time as a family and enjoyed the screened in porch. Had some great food from the area restaurants!"

It is at the end of the lake so the water was a little lower for us but that didn’t stop them from giving us suggestions on ways to have fun. The Wi-Fi is also pretty rough and we had no service but they gave instructions for how to combat that so be prepared just in case you rent here. They are extremely responsive, gave tons of suggestions, and really were so friendly. My family and I had an absolute blast. I highly recommend this place!"

My only small complaints are that the ice maker didn’t work and the game room had a mildew smell so we didn’t use that much and brought some games to the main house.
Other than that it was fantastic!"

Stayed with kids","Inn the Cove was a wonderful place for a busy family to relax and reconnect. Everything was as described, with our only complaint being that the peddleboat was broken and could not be used during our stay. One night, after 11:30pm, the smoke alarm started going off and we had to contact the management - who was extremely responsive! It was recommended to buy fire for the fire pit at the general store, but you didn't get much for the price. However, just to the left of Manor Oak is a neighbor who sells bigger bundles at a reasonable price. The place was beautifully decorated, peaceful, and everything we hoped it to be and more. We definitely hope to return again in the future!"

They have thought of everything… fully stocked kitchen with beautiful countertops, glorious screened in porch, extra large back porch, windows that open from the kitchen to the screened in porch, exquisite master bathroom/shower, fire pit, nice dock with kayaks, detailed instructions, new washer/dryer, large flat screen tvs, etc. An extra bonus to this home is the fabulous “boat house” that has a pool table, four extra beds, bathroom/shower, large flat screen tv, games, etc. The host was very friendly and responsive as well. We really appreciated being notified that the house was ready and that we could check in two hours early! We will definitely stay here again! I have already recommended it many friends and family members."

Many places to relax -- conversation on the back screened porch or on the dock or around the fire pit. A nap on the day bed on the screened porch or on the comfy beds. Unwinding in a game of pool or on kayak ride. Sharing a meal from the lovely, well stocked kitchen too gathering around the table in the dining nook or on the screened porch. Andrew was so responsive and available in his communication. Cannot say enough for this incredible place!"

Group trip","We rented this for our friends to stay in for our wedding weekend. It was nice because boys and girls could be separated by the pool house so it was like having two houses rented on property. Interiors are gorgeous. The master bed is super comfortable - not too mushy, not too hard but supportive and firm. The master shower was gorgeous and spacious with plenty of hot water. Only complaint was that there were no bath towels upon checkin when all our out of town guests wanted nothing more than to shower; however host was very responsive with bringing a big bag of fresh towels by the next morning. One of our friends also left his AirPods and the host had the cleaning crew find it and then shipped it to him and sent tracking, which went above and beyond. Would stay here again."

Stayed with kids","We would come back, and that's the highest rating I can give an AirBnb. The space, grounds, amenities, and sleep spaces matched the description EXACTLY. No hype here, no misleading photos, and everything listed in the ad is present, new, clean, and thoughtful. Make no mistake, you aren't within walking distance of any food or entertainment, which was exactly what our group was looking for: peace, quiet, water, and plenty to do at our house in terms of space to spread out, space to make food, space to play inside and out. The host made great recommendations for places to eat and visit locally, and don't miss Bell's Hamburgers for some of the best home-cooked southern fare any of us have had. Lastly, I think it's worth mentioning that when I had two questions (before check-in and making the host aware of a minor issue), they were extremely responsive and helpful. Well done from top to bottom."

We loved the lake, we took advantage of all three kayaks (the big one didn’t have seats but still worked). Had a fire every night!! Neighbors dogs will visit and take off with stuff if you aren’t looking, neighbors also fire their guns, but we were never worried. The place was perfect. Hiked Tallulah falls and Toccoa falls, and drove to Helen!! Loved it here!!!!
Lots of games on hand as well!!"

Stayed with kids","We absolutely LOVED our stay. There was more than enough supplies like toilet paper, dishwasher tabs, towels, etc. We were a group of 4 adults, 1 ten month old, 2 eight year olds, and 1 eleven year old. We all loved the space and enjoyed it to the fullest. Anytime the adults decided to leave and do some exploring and hiking the kids begged to stay. They enjoyed kayaking, the paddle boat and the boat house the most.
Other things to note was that the kitchen was well stocked with dishes, pots, pans, etc. There was salt, pepper and olive oil as well as most other spices we could think of! The wash machine had detergent and dryer sheets to use as well. A coffee grinder was provided with beans and filters and was so good!
We had also reached out to see if they had a pack-n-play for a ten month old and they bought one specifically for our stay to keep at the space. The communication was excellent. Reach out if you have questions or needs and they will likely accommodate. Amazing stay!"

The cove is very shallow, so we couldn't swim off the dock, but loved hanging out and the hammock seats are really comfy.
The kitchen is well stocked, plenty of dishes so we didn't have to run the dishwasher after every meal. Andrew was quick to respond to every message and was very helpful. Thanks for a great week!"

It was nice to have a separate space (the boat house) for our kids to hang out at night. The house has everything you need! I definitely recommend this house, unless you are visualizing yourself jumping off the dock and swimming. The water is low (as noted in the description of the house) and you just wouldn't want to get in there anyway. BUT, they have paddling options there and all you have to do is paddle out of the cove (very short paddle) and then you are able to enjoy the deep, cool water of the lake!"

My family loved the pool table and giant connect 4 game in the boat house and Andrew was very prompt with responses to our questions. Our only complaint is the state of the water in the cove, it was filled with algae and smelled bad. Even with water shoes no one wanted to get in the water. Thankfully we rented a boat and were able to go outside of the cove where the water was wonderful."

The house was clean and very well stocked with everything from coffee, filters, and extra toilet paper to even shampoo & conditioner in each shower. The beds are comfortable. We never hurt for things to do - with pool table, board games, and kayaks to keep us busy! Communication was quick and helpful. Highly recommend"

All the outside equipment and furniture was in great shape. The multiple living spaces were a nice touch. Indoor outdoor living was really enjoyable. The hosts have thought of everything. We cooked on the clean bbq and had s’mores in the fire pit. As it was basically all one level, it was user friendly for our elderly grandparents. Our kids loved the bunk beds and all the activities. You can’t go wrong with this place. The hosts were very responsive. ☺️"

Stayed with kids","If you're looking for a place to host your next family vacation, girl/guy trip... look no further. This home has to be one of Georgia's best kept secrets as it was a beautiful gemstone tucked in Toccoa. It sits on a lake with a beautiful dock that has a paddle boat and three kayaks waiting for use and two hammocks swings if you just want to relax. This home has a boathouse that was turned into a gaming/sleeping quarters for four, a tv and pool table! Including the main house, which had three other bedrooms and a pull out couch bed, all 14 family members were able to sleep comfortably. There was a SOP/guidebook left by the host to help guide us throughout our stay. The host also stayed in contact with us from date of booking until check out. If at anytime we needed something, he was a click away. Although we brought our own seasonings and some kitchen items we thought we couldn't live without, none was necessary as this home's kitchen was completely stocked from seasonings to blenders. We really enjoyed making memories in this home and will most definitely come back again next year."

Group trip","This house is perfect for a large group that want to hang out at a lake.
We had a group of 8 adults cook 3 meals a day for a long weekend. There were more than enough provided cooking devices, platters, plates, silverware, etc to accommodate us without having to wash every single dish in the place. The Ingles market for groceries is like a 15 min drive. There was an additional drink fridge in the guesthouse.
The neighborhood was quiet in February. We saw maybe 6 other vessels on the lake all weekend. Our group used all the kayaks and peddle boat (almost all beginners) successfully with the gear provided.
The guesthouse with the billiard table was so clutch! All the games provided are varied enough to keep a variety of ages entertained. We barely put the tv on because the common areas were all so welcoming for our group to use. We could spread out and have quiet time away from one another. We could come together as a big group and play a game or eat.
I found all the beds and bathrooms luxe and comfortable. The provided soaps and shampoo, etc. were all well placed, plentiful, and enjoyable.
One thing to note is most of us did not have cell service in the area, but the Wi-Fi was pretty solid in the bedrooms. We had two guests take Zoom calls for 30min- 1 hour."

We had to find a last minute booking due to a winter storm that knocked out power higher up in the mountains. We were so thankful that Andrew was patient with us as we were navigating that issue before booking.
The house and property were wonderful. A beautiful view of the cove to wake up to every morning. The decor was fantastic and cohesive. The beds were comfy. The bathroom and shower were everything I could have hoped for. There were plenty of activities around the house and water that we never even got to enjoy, but maybe we will have time for those things next time. In particular, I wish I had time to take the kayak out onto the water.
I would definitely book this home again in an instant the next time we are staying in the area."

Group trip","10 STARS!! We highly recommend this gorgeous lake house! Inn The Cove is beautiful, tastefully decorated, spacious, comfortable, sparkling clean and very well maintained. The photos are accurate, however they do not do the home justice. Andrew & Ali, prepare to be rock stars in the vacation rental world. My daughter loved the home's aesthetic and has already started redecorating her own home.
THE SPACE: The home is very relaxing and offers a lot of indoor and outdoor space. The living room is large with plenty of comfortable and cozy seating. The kitchen is beautiful, well-stocked with lots of amenities and high quality appliances. The bedrooms are large with good storage, comfortable beds, plush linens and there were plenty of extra blankets/pillows provided by the host. The bathrooms are big with good water pressure and lasting hot water. Plenty of bathroom linens are provided. The outdoor deck is large with lots of seating, peaceful, quiet and perfect for morning coffee. The screened-in porch was by far my favorite spot. We had dinner there every night and then made s'mores at the fire pit. The washer and dryer worked well, the TV/Cable/WiFi all worked fine and the AC kept the home very comfortable. The dock is large and offers the use of kayaks and a pedal boat. The driveway/parking area is well lit and provides enough space for larger vehicles.
THE LOCATION: The home is nestled in a quiet cul-de-sac. It is very peaceful and private. The property is full of nature, we enjoyed seeing all the litter critters and we especially enjoyed the chipmunk greeter. The views of the lake are just gorgeous. We had no issues with privacy or noise from the neighbors. It was a 10 minute drive to the major chain stores.
THE HOST: Andrew responded quickly to my questions and offered us some awesome recommendations for fun things to do. We took them all and had a wonderful family vacation. We truly enjoyed our time at Inn The Cove. We plan to make this home our future Georgia vacation rental and can not wait to return. Andrew and Ali, we wish you the best of luck in the future and we thank you for the hospitality. ~ The Price 5"

Stayed about a week","This place went above and beyond our expectations! We decided to visit northern Georgia for our honeymoon and we could not have been more pleased. The thought, detail, care and love the hosts have put into this place is exceptional.
The location, decor and amenities were amazing! Our favorite was the private dock with kayaks to voyage around the lake as often as we wanted. I also really loved how the games were rustic and decoratively placed with such thought!
Game room was great with a full sized pool table that we absolutely loved.
They had everything needed in the kitchen.
And the hosts were consistently checking in with us to be sure we had everything we needed, to be sure everything was the best experience plus sending us awesome recommendations for things to do throughout our trip. At check-in, we walked into the lovely surprise of a bottle of champagne and a thoughtful note wishing us a wonderful life together as they remembered it was for our honeymoon!
This was definitely one of the best and most comfortable AirBNBs we’ve ever had the pleasure of staying at.
Thank you so much to the hosts for making our honeymoon so special in the forest of northern Georgia on the beautiful lake!

From the boat house to the screened-in porch, there is no shortage of nooks to curl up in, plus if you are a bigger group, the open floor plan would make it easy to spend time all together. The house was fully stocked with everything we needed, especially in the kitchen, where we cooked everyday during our five days at the lake. It was such an awesome spot, and we will absolutely be back!"

It was very clean , the coffee mugs were spotless ( I checked, because we live off coffee, ), all dishes were freshly clean. The kitchen had all the utensils and cookware. Bathrooms are clean,were stuck with shampoo, conditioner and body washes, toilet paper. Plenty of towels. Nice set up on the porch, very inviting and relaxing. Short walk to the lake,very relaxing and safe.
Beds are comfortable, and have an extra couple of blankets. Overall we had the best time, recharge and ready for school."

There are neighbors but not to close and very friendly. Would definitely recommend staying here. Very quiet area but we have 3 teenagers and a 6yr old and they can get noisy at times and still enough space to let them be them. They had a grill that we cooked out on the first night which was great to have. Only 30mins from the state park Tallulah that we went to check out. Overall love this place.

We took advantage of hiking Tallulah Gorge and Taccoa Falls, and would highly recommend both. Overall this cabin was perfect and stocked with everything we needed.

Close to nice trails, waterfalls, and national park. Ingles and Walmart only 10/15 minutes away. Love the walk to the dock. We went kayaking one day. They are sit on top kayaks and you will get wet, so be prepared for that. The host was very responsive and helpful. Overall a very positive experience."

Group trip","This house is a wonderful retreat for the family, especially ones with small children. The bunk beds were a hit with the kids. They had a great ""sleep-over."" The trail down to the lake was an adventure. The owners set up a discovery path where we had to find animal signs staked out on the trail. We found all of them but the eagle. I suspect you had to look higher than we did. The lake was a place for a wonderful picnic. It is quiet and secluded. You should know the space is shared by the neighbors and you should respect their docks. But there is a dock assigned to the house and its plenty of fun to fish from. You have access to the kayaks and chairs. The house is very comfortable with brand-new appliances. The house is clean and safe. The beds are wonderful-great mattresses. The location is not too far from town and we found great places to eat. The owners are super responsive and communication was great. By all accounts, a Five Star stay."

We are just a family of four - but the house worked great with a toddler and an infant - making my packing much easier and I got more sleep than at home!
Really nice walk to the docks. The house is in kind of a residential neighborhood when you drive in, but the walk to the lake feels like the woods and we didn’t see and neighbors when we were at the lake.
House set up would be great for traveling with more family or a friends weekend. Photos are super accurate. Master bed and living room very comfortable. Everything you need in a kitchen - and generally in a super natural spot to find. We really enjoy cooking, and this is the best Airbnb we have found for that."

Stayed a few nights","Sherri is a great host and does an amazing job keeping her Airbnb clean and organized. She was very helpful with any questions I had and supplied me with a pan, utensils, ect. Anything you need is just a message/ knock on the door away. There is also a washer and dryer she let me use so that was a plus. The fridge had plenty of room for food and beer and Sherri had plenty of ice. There was salt/ pepper and all the basic stuff you need along with a coffee maker and propane grill. Outside of the house there is a fire pit and plenty of fire wood, 3 kayaks, and 3 canoes. You can sit on the beach or on the dock and jump in the water or float around on a raft. All in all I would highly recommend this space with no complaints. Thanks Sherri!"

If you’re looking for a place where time passes slower, where vivid memories are made and where inspiration (re) fills you, you’ve come to the right place; not even Norman Rockwell could have painted a more perfect place to be.
Sherri, and Chipper (15yr old friendly Jack Russell) were exceptional hosts!"

Her little cottage feels like home from the first time you pull in the driveway till your tires leave her road. The lake view was a balm to our harried family of five (and two pups), and we had a blast kayaking. Whether sitting by the fire in the front yard or lazing on the porch, there is ample seating for everyone. The beds are so comfy and the bathroom is the cleanest I think we've ever experienced with an AirBnB. We plan to be back sometime soon!"

Stayed with a pet","Man where do I start??? Ok let’s start with out host Sherri. Down home southern charm all day long. Communication was perfect! She was there to greet us on the porch even though we were a little late for checking in. Even made sure she had extra snacks since we had not eaten all day. She even introduced herself to Spicy Dog and had a few treats waiting!
Now unto On the Edge, the name of the property. Freshly refurbished without keeping the charm of an old fishing cabin. Looking around at the wonderful decor one can see and even hear grandpa telling stories of the one that got away!
The linens were fresh and the mini fridge was packed with plenty of snacks and drinks. Keep in mind there’s no traditional kitchen, but there’s microwave for quick meals. My wife and I had a few nice steaks and Sherri was more than happy to let us use their grill, even their own porch to eat and enjoy the lake views. After we enjoyed S’mores over the fire pit…mmmm
There are some water toys available, canoes, water boards etc..
Our short stay will definitely become a longer stay in the future. My wife and I have already begun making arrangements to include our sons and their families, as well as my mother and Father.
That’s if we don’t buy a property first! …lol
Please take care getting to On the Edge, the street signs are quite old and can’t be seen in the dark! We totally understand that this is a minor inconvenience."

When I reached out to Sarah she responded in minutes. My stay was comfortable & this is coming from someone who is very particular about where they stay. I would defiantly stay there again!

Stayed a few nights","We loved the apartment overlooking Main Street Toccoa. The shops were decorated beautifully for Christmas. The place was clean & comfortable. We loved being able to walk to shops & restaurants. We drove to Dillard, GA one day & ate at Dillard House which was a great experience. We all so went to Curahee winery in Toccoa which was so fun.
My only complaint was the neighbor in the next door apartment talks so very loud you could hear all her conversations in the evening in the kitchen. This is no fault of the owner. You did not hear neighbor in bedrooms only in the kitchen/living area.
Great little place! We would visit Toccoa again!
Thanks!"

I would have to say the only issues were the stairs ( 32 to go in with luggage) so wouldn’t recommend to someone older or disabled. Also the freight train runs behind- which did not bother us, but might be good to know for some."

The apartment is super cute, spacious and well stocked. The host was very responsive and gracious. This is a full size apartment, not the normal cramped airBnB - plenty of room for kids or activities. High ceilings, hard wood floors, lots of extras!
We tried R & R across the street - service and food far exceeded expectations in this sleepy little town."

The location was convenient, super close to downtown and the restaurants, and the host was very helpful throughout my stay. Easy check in and check out process. It had everything we needed, including high-speed Wifi, AC, and heating to keep us comfortable during our stay. The bathrooms were well-stocked with essentials (towels, soap, and toilet paper, and very nice shampoo)and hot water in the shower never ran out. The hangers made it easy to keep our clothes looking neat which was much appreciated as a wedding guest. Oh and the laundry room was a lifesaver for my dress! The kitchen was fully equipped with everything we needed to prepare meals during our stay. It even has a coffee and tea bar! The rooms were spacious and there’s also private parking right in the front, which was a huge plus. I definitely recommend this Airbnb. We had a nice time staying here and the amenities were excellent."

The property is very well kept outside. The kids loved the horses and were able to enjoy feeding them. The sunsets were amazing. We had plenty of room for our group of 15 to spread out, and everything we needed in the kitchen for family dinners.
The only opportunity to improve the stay would’ve been new mattresses, but typical in rental properties.
Thank you Luis & Nancy for a great stay! Thankful for the memories you’ve helped us create."

He provided wood and marshmallows and chocolate for the fire pit and all utensils and towels we needed for our activities. He has an easy to connect to WIFI with good speed and connectivity for a large family using multiple devices.
Luis was so attentive to our needs and was available when we needed help with his fancy appliances. The view is to die for and we are definitely considering visiting again in the future.

He was so proactive about making sure our vision came to life, even though it was different from previous guests’. He was willing to be so flexible and made himself available even when he didn’t have to. He even went out unprompted and bought another space heater during our reception because there was a sudden turn in weather. The view is somehow even better in real life. He also saw us heading toward the horses on the property to take photos, and he came out of his house with carrots so we could feed them and bring them closer. I saw he did the same during our wedding for my family. He is ON IT at all times. 10/10 recommend. He and Nancy are a breath of fresh air after dealing with vendors in the wedding industry."

There are beautiful works of art all over the house! Our hosts were wonderful. We had no pool table chalk, but Luis provided it to us within an hour or two! There was no delay. The owners were on site and available at all times. The grounds are well looked after. The resort style pool/spa is guaranteed to be the highlight of your trip, and I doubt you’ll find another rental in this price range with similar pool/poolside facilities. There was a lovey but unexpected surprise for us to enjoy on the counter when we arrived. I won’t give spoilers on that! I highly recommend bagging one of the upstairs Queen bedrooms for the best views of the mountains! Do not hesitate to spend your time at this rental."

We politely declined but she did go buy a small cookie cake for our kids and had it waiting on us.

I would have loved to have gotten to use the hot tub. Other than that it was a great stay! Quiet home in the woods. Super close to town so that was convenient for food. We enjoyed our stay and we would definitely stay again! Thanks Ann

Stayed a few nights",110% recommend this location to anyone just trying to get away. I had a family emergency and had to book my airbnb early morning hours. I wrote Ann to let her know and her response was quick. I was driving over 20 hours and reached out to Ann if I could possibly check in early since my mother in law had passed. I didn't make it to see her one last time. Ann made sure she called me and told me that the house was ready when I was. Ann gave her condolences and made sure my husband and I were doing okay. It was one of the hardest weeks of our lives and yet we still felt at home and welcomed. Im sure Ann had to rush to get us in early but it was much appreciated since we wanted some private time to mourn. Also the balcony in the back is breath taking. I sat out most afternoons and read while I had my coffee. It helped me put my mind to rest a little. This property is absolutely gorgeous. I promise you wont regret it. Thank you Ann for the stay and never correcting me when I called you Anna

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I went on a close to last minute small vacation right after Christmas. This was a very affordable option to stay in the peaceful, quiet town of Toccoa. Ann's property is beautiful and the cottage may not look secluded from the front but inside and the balcony porch were enough to allow my wife and I to feel connected to nature and serene. We greatly enjoyed our stay and if we are ever back in Toccoa, we would love to stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","The Emerald Cottage was the perfect setting for our 29th honeymoon weekend! So quaint and comfortable, with a large eat-in kitchen, comfy furnishings, bright warm shower, and beautiful grounds. We didn’t take advantage of the deck, the hot tub, the hammocks, or the fire pit, but we did enjoy strolling down to the creek, immersing ourselves in the natural beauty of the place. And, it was nice to know those amenities were available should we want to use them.
The location is perfect for getting into the historic downtown—including the Ritz Theatre, or making a jaunt to the store for necessities or one of the many restaurants nearby, or trekking over to Toccoa Falls College or Toccoa Lake for beautiful Fall foliage and peaceful strolls.
If you’re in the area to hike or bike the local trails, be sure to stop into Currahee Outfitters downtown for any gear or knowhow you need.
We’ll be back to this area and hope to enjoy our new home away from home at Emerald Cottage."

The cabin was really cute, very well decorated, and had probably everything you could possibly need. The beds were really comfortable, too. Firm but still squishy!
We hiked all day and then went back to the cabin to play games and relax. It was perfect for our family of three but I also think it'd work well if it were two couples.
Definitely booking here again!!!"

One item that is shown on drawings but not so well from photo is the spiral stairway to the upstairs loft. While this is clearly noted in the property information, there are no good photos of it. Overall, the property is well appointed and in very good shape including appliances which seem to be barely used.

Huge shower downstairs, great kitchen and comfortable beds. We got into town later than planned and they had the lights on for us and the house was warm. Small details like fall decorations, hot cocoa and fixin's had been set out for our enjoyment...you can tell they put a lot of love into this place!! I'd come back to Toccoa just to visit here and spend a little more time exploring this area of Georgia. Toccoa Falls is really something to see if you're in the area!!

The four of us stayed upstairs in the loft area on the three beds and the other couple slept downstairs. The downstairs would suit the elderly very well. It was very nice to have a full and well stocked kitchen and a full size laundry area.
The hosts were incredibly responsive. The house was nicely tucked off the beaten path but very much within short walking distance to the heart of downtown. We never had any issues with noise, lights, anything of that sort and rested quite well."

From the enchanting and beautiful porch, watching fireflies in the backyard and sleeping in the wonderful linens on the beds. Check-in was seamless and there were snacks, cold beverages and a fresh loaf of Laura’s Blueberry poppyseed bread. I wished we could have stayed longer to soak up all beauty of Georgia."

Stayed with kids","Laura and Steve are great hosts, who are naturals as inn keepers. The details were personable, the accomodations most pleasant. Very clean, offering any convenience needed if you are staying in to just enjoy. The guest house is enviable in many ways; from the great master suite with HUGE bathroom, to the family oriented living area. Love the spiral staircase to the spacious upper loft. It accommodated three adults and two children comfortably. They had games, puzzles, TV with cable access, two porch areas to enjoy the mountain air. This stay rivals any high end penthouse hotel stay in the feel of luxury and details. Comfortable bed. Comfortable recliner sofas for movie watching. Spacious kitchen with all amenities. One of the best AirBnb stays I've had.
The ONLY dissatisfaction was with the water pressure, which was not Laura and Steve's fault; as I have experienced similar in hotel stays in GA. I like a strong hot shower as part of a relaxing vacation, and although the water was hot, it was lackluster pressure. HOWEVER, this does NOT reflect on the efforts, details or experience Laura and Steve so greatly provided. Still a 5 star experience! We would book again if returning to the area. Defenitely recommend their hospitality!"

It was a good central location that made day trips to other towns very convenient. The unit was very private and super quiet. The cleanliness was over the top, and the amenities are unmatched pretty much anywhere. It was great for my traveling partner (my mom) who has serious mobility issues. And the fact that the second bed and bath were on the second floor made things even better. There was not a single thing that wasn't already provided when we arrived. And the hosts are super nice people! If I am ever in the Toccoa area again, I will try to rent this place before any other. Thaks so much to my amazing hosts! I wish you well!"

Group trip","What an adorable and convenient guest house! For a group of 6 traveling to the college, we could not have asked for a better stay! We had 6 separate individuals so 2 slept on couches, which were quite comfy. We enjoyed the living space where we could debrief and enjoy each other. The 2 outdoor doggos were sweet and the handwritten notes and comfy linens made us feel at home. Definitely check out the Java Station while in town!"

Stephen and his family were also communicative, kind, and patient with us when our plans changed last minute. They were always quick to respond and were waiting for us with a smile and a quick, friendly tour when we arrived in the late evening.
In short, we have nothing but wonderful things to say about Stephen, his family, and his home, and we’d gladly stay there again in the future."

Group trip","My bridesmaids and I stayed here the night before my wedding, and the Toccoa Guest House was beautiful and far exceeded expectations. Photos don't do this restful home justice. The house is spacious, cozy, and clean. It's also well-equipped with everything you'd expect and more from a top-notch AirBnb. The most noteworthy characteristic is the awesome hosts, Steve & Laura, who were more than accommodating for us. I never met them personally, but my bridesmaids who were greeted upon arrival said they were very kind. Steve and Laura even went the extra mile to fill some additional requests I had prior to our stay so that we could comfortably get ready for my wedding. Communication was prompt and clear. If you're on the fence about booking, just do it! I searched for and considered many properties in the area due to the nature of our stay, and I am so glad I chose this property. The time leading up to my wedding was pleasant, and I will cherish the memories made here for years to come!"

Stayed a few nights","This was the best AirBnb that we've been to. Definitely much bigger than the pictures and beautifully decorated. We could see ourselves living in this guest home indefinitely. Stephen was friendly and a great host. The drinks and snacks were a nice touch and much appreciated. The location is close enough to Helen, Ga which is a hot spot for tubing and a quant little town with shopping and restaurants. Tocca has a Wal-Mart close by. We didn't eat at any restaurants since we use a AirBnb to save money on meals. I would strongly recommendnd and will use again if we are in the area."

We had more than enough room for everyone, and it was lovely to be able to use a full fridge and kitchen (even if we mainly enjoyed snacks and tea and coffee provided!). Soft beds and plenty of sitting space made the rooms the perfect place to relax between a long trip and a wedding. The pretty deck between where we were staying and the house was a nice touch as well. I was only disappointed that we could not stay longer to enjoy the place!"

Stayed a few nights","After checking out the hotel/BnB options within the desired radius & being highly disappointed in availability/price/reviews, we were thrilled to find this AirBnB option that was exactly what we were looking for. We very much appreciated the refrigerator stocked with water bottles (although the local tap water isn't bad). Both bedrooms don't have windows, which facilitated sleeping in. We did run into the owners during our stay, & we mentioned that the headboard for the King bed was very squeaky. They were aware, but had not found a solution. The bed was comfortable though. The water pressure & hot water availability were both fine. We weren't using the shower during peak 'get ready for work' time though. I looked for a way to regulate temperature, & there wasn't any way to do that (that I could find), but we weren't uncomfortable. Wifi speeds were fine. There is no 'kitchen sink', so have to get water from the bathroom sink. Not generally a problem unless you have a very tall canteen."

We were in town for a wedding at Toccoa Falls and found the location central and ideal for all the events. The host was very quick to help when we had questions during our stay.
While the location was central, there was some noise from neighbors in the adjacent loft and traffic throughout the night. I felt safe my entire stay, but did always stay aware of my surroundings given some watchful neighbors in the morning and evenings.
All around would stay here again and recommend to friends."

The renovation was the best we have seen while staying in Airbnb. The home was very comfortable, beautifully decorated, and had a wonderful kitchen. This will be one we will reserve later in the summer."

It was also only 5 minutes from the wedding venue at Flat Rock Farm. The downtown location was fantastic. We walked around downtown and visited the local shops and Antique stores. We were unaware that the Toast of Toccoa event was going on Saturday morning. The whole street was blocked off with local artists, food trucks, classic cars and Beer and Wine vendors. It was the perfect distraction for our downtime the morning of the wedding. I was able to spend time walking around with family that were in town for the wedding as well. Parking was easy as I was able to catch the spot on the street right in front of the door open every time we came back. Highly recommend to anyone looking to stay in a convenient location in Toccoa."

Group trip","Visiting the area from out of state for a family wedding. Jordan and Naomi, co hosts answered all questions prior to and after booking. Naomi reached out the week before check-in to make sure plans for travel were working out how we planned and to offer assistance if needed anything. The week of check-in, Naomi reached out to provide additional instructions and make sure there were no questions I needed answered before we arrived. Naomi was kind, responsive, and polite.
We (family of 6) enjoyed the space. 1 large room (master) with a queen size bed, a chaise, closet with a half bathroom. 1 room with a queen size bed and dresser with mirror. 1 room, multi purpose, with day bed and trundle. In this room, there are 2 massage chairs. Very nice addition! 1 half bathroom down the hallway and another full bathroom off the kitchen. Kitchen has full size refrigerator and dishwasher.

The apartment is in the middle of historic downtown and it is quaint.
If i visit this area again I would definitely stay here."

Group trip","A little pricey for what we needed it for, but given the decor, furnishings, etc. I can certainly understand why.
We tend to opt for AirBnB's when we go out of town, simply for the privacy and amenities. This house was far more luxurious than any others we've stayed at. It didn't feel like a rental. The furnishings, linens, etc. were far nicer than your typical Airbnb.
Host was responsive when I had a question, and check in was exactly like she described in the message.
I highly recommend this property if you're in the area. The place is serene, and very easy to relax and decompress from life's chaos."

Stayed a few nights","A Hidden Gem of Peace and Relaxation
Janet's place was a hidden gem of peace and relaxation. I've read multiple reviews mentioning that the photos don't do it justice, and I couldn't agree more. The moment I arrived, I knew I made the right choice to spend the entire weekend here. It felt like having my own private day spa.
The house is beautifully private, and the amenities exceeded my expectations. The highlight for me was the huge garden tub and the massage chairs - truly a luxurious experience. The serene surroundings and the attention to detail in the house made it feel like a retreat from the hustle and bustle of daily life.
Janet was an exceptional host, and I want to thank her for sharing her wonderful home with me. I couldn't have asked for a more perfect getaway. The money spent on this stay was undoubtedly well worth it.
I highly recommend Janet's Place to anyone looking for a peaceful and rejuvenating escape. It's an incredible value for the experience it offers."

The check-in was easy and the house quickly warmed up when we turned up the temp a bit. The house is beautifully apportioned, has 2 baths and lovely bedrooms. The kitchen is well-equipped and spacious too, I almost wished I could have the same home. The house was super clean. Janet was responsive and provided helpful hints what to visit in the area eg. kid-friendly walks as soon as we confirmed the reservation. I highly recommend Janet's place."

We were in Toccoa for my daughter's wedding and this home provided ample space for our family of five. We were not able to be there much with all the activities going on over the weekend, but the location was perfect for her wedding at Toccoa Falls and the reception at Lake Toccoa Event Center.

Only thing to note, there was currently a traditional coffee pot, so be prepared with your own coffee beans/grounds if you want a morning beverage. We just assumed it was a k-cup style and brought our own )our fault for not even thinking about a traditional maker), but there’s a grocery store very close if needing to pick something up."

We did much touristing of the waterfalls and forestry trails with my aunt and the rest the time stayed in visiting with gram. It was super clean all newly remodeled very accessible for my grams and we also found it very conveniently located just far enough from town but not too far!
