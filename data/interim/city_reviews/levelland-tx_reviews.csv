The room with two twin beds is actually a full and a twin which made the stay even better! She even has lots of additional bathroom and kitchen items in case your party forgets anything.

Stayed a few nights","The worst! I rented this location from Anna for my in laws. My father-in-law has major mobility issues and this was discussed with Anna prior to check in. She states we could have access once current renters were out. This did not happen. We contacted her to cancel, she stated to cancel through Airbnb. Every communication with Airbnb was after midnight, and took multiple days to get an Airbnb person on the phone. Per Airbnb policy, it is up to the host to allow cancellation. She did not - even after multiple attempts to try to see if the location would work!
The worst!"

My wife enjoyed the little decorative accents that made this house feel like a home without being cluttered. When we had a question or concern, Anna was quick to get back with us and be sure we were happy. We absolutely loved this place in Levelland on a quiet street. I wish we had more time to hang around and enjoy the space. This place is highly recommended!"

Stayed a few nights","We live in East Texas and when my Aunt passed away suddenly and we had to make lodging reservations quickly for the trip out west, we wanted something that would be homey and comfortable for our family. I'm so thankful I found the Cotton Cottage on the AirBnB site. It was just what my family needed during a very sad time and after a very long trip.
First of all the communication with our host before arriving was great. When we pulled up it was everything that was described. Beautiful, clean, homey...we especially loved the back patio area to sit and unwind after our long trip. The home and furnishings were beautiful. I took pictures to share with friends and family. We felt safe, secure and at home. The beds were very comfortable after that long drive and gave us a good nights rest..
Everything we needed for our stay was provided and that was very helpful and convenient.
I requested to be able to check out at a little later time, so after the funeral we could come back, change our clothes and load the car for our 500 mile trip back home. They said that was no problem...and we appreciated that.
There's not much more I can say other than thank you for making our short stay comfortable and relaxing, and should we ever return to Levelland, Texas, I hope the Cotton Cottage will be available!"

Ice in the freezer for a cold beverage, comfortable towels and the most comfortable bed we have slept in in over 10 days of a road trip (so more than 5 locations!). In the morning we made coffee and there were to go cups and snacks! We could not have asked for a better stop on our way back north! :)"

Stayed with kids","My wife and I frequent Lubbock for both work and to visit family. We always search for homes on AirBnB hosted by Jaiven. This is our 3rd stay at their property and they never disappoint. The friendliest of hosts imaginable and their response times are second to none. My wife and I prefer their homes as we always say “how clean the house looks and smells”. We are a family that doesn’t use products with artificial dyes and sure enough their laundry pods don’t contain it.
We’ve even looked up where to find some of their decor items to get for our own home. Amazing people who take pride in their property. As always, will seek them out each time we travel to Lubbock. If only they had a house in every town I travel to for work!"

Stayed a few nights","I had a couple of hiccups but hosts were very quick to respond and assist. My only recommendation would be a garage door opener. Be careful not to lock yourself out by locking the glass security door from the inside and going out the garage. I didn’t realize this unit was a duplex in a complex of four units but I had no issues with the neighbors. From a safety point of view it’s a plus. This unit is on the western edge of Lubbock (apparently the safest side of town) and pretty much the last of the houses in that direction so very little vehicle or foot traffic. Very close to Cagle steak house which is worth a visit. There is a grocery store within walking distance on 4th and Milwaukee but I went to Market Street on 19th (approx 5 min drive). Also tons of restaurants and shopping if you go south on Milwaukee. The unit is super comfortable. TVs in both bedrooms and living room. No local connection but Netflix, Prime, etc. The decor adds a homey feeling. I’d stay here again."

The house could use some fresh updates, but it had plenty of room, convenient location, and responsive team. We would stay again."

Stayed with kids",Jaiven and his family were the most attentive and gracious hosts. I’ve never booked with Airbnb before but for a first time experience it was a great one. When we brought it to his attention that his cleaning crew did not clean up the sofa couch. He personal came out and cleaned it himself. He also seemed to have a bad experience with his last guests because there were things that were missing for our stay and he went out of his way to replace the missing items for our stay. Check in time is super flexible which is great if you’re driving in from far. If you want to stay somewhere where you will be well taken care of Jaiven’s is the way to go. 10/10 would recommend and stay again. Thank you so much Jaiven you guys made our stay great.

It's a Texas-sized studio which means it's about 4 times bigger than my old California one. The quiet and snowy landscape of Jennifer's ranch during our stay was lovely. (If you are concerned about your vehicle making it on the ranch, don't be. It's close to a main road and has clear roads. I drive a Honda Civic coup and had absolutely no problems)."

Before we left on Sunday, she arrived back so we were able to meet and she was very warm, friendly, and welcoming. Our favorite part was being able to bring our two dogs with us- they had a great time exploring the property and were so glad to get to come on our trip. Jennifer even added dog bowls and tennis balls for us in the airbnb for us! We had a great stay."

Stayed over a week","The apartment is a spacious place with plenty of room to spread out, and well appointed. If you enjoy horses it’s the spot for you, and even the neighboring cows are gorgeous. Jennifer and her family were welcoming and unobtrusive and of I ever find myself in Lubbock again I would definitely come back."

Stayed over a week","Perfect place for any travel nurses who have pets. Internet is fast, laundry is inside, full kitchen and sink, etc. It’s a short 20-25 minute drive to UMC. The biggest hurdle is the stairs up to the loft if your pet isn’t used to them, but that’s pretty much it. Our German Shepherd loved being able to walk around their big property in the mornings. Will definitely stay at again if I have another assignment in Lubbock."

We had a FABULOUS time! 4 couples stayed and was half the price we would have paid for a hotel for the 8 of us. The place is brand new and is decorated great! So many places to hang out, very comfortable beds, big kitchen, we never felt we were on top of each other. It's not necessarily close to campus, but Lubbock is only so big.
Thanks again, would definitely stay again if the need arises!!"

Group trip","Great place! Extremely clean and modern. Located in a very safe and quiet neighborhood. Probably the nicest Airbnb we have ever booked. I suppose if we had anything to criticize it would be the shower head in the master bathroom. Although modern and nice, it is difficult to take a quick shower. Also there are no ceiling fans in the house and no blinds/curtains in the master bedroom door/window that opens to the private outside patio. Having said that, the criticisms are petty given the fact that the master bathroom is beautiful and spacious, the private patio is outstanding and the air conditioning is great. We have stayed at many places across the US and again, this is probably the nicest/cleanest Airbnb we have ever booked. In addition, the host was very proactive and responsive. We couldn’t imagine booking a better place to stay in Lubbock for the price."

Group trip","We loved staying at Jennifer's place and she was more than responsive, gave us lots of recommendations, and when the dish washer didn't work they were there immediately to fix, even though we said it was okay and we didn't need to use, she was quick!
The ONLY thing was that there are no curtains on one of the rooms that has a outdoor patio so it would be nice to close those so people cant see in but we just put a plastic table cloth from the dollar store over the window and it was fine.
I would highly suggest staying here and we plan to stay again when we come back up in a few months if it is available."

The home was very minimal but surprisingly tidy for a home that allows pets. Back yard was decent/adequate for the dogs but we would’ve enjoyed a place to sit outside since it was such nice weather.

Group trip","Nice neighborhood, the beds were very comfortable with cute animal towels on display as you walk into each bedroom. Also if you forgot your toothbrush, razor... he has some provided for you.
If you like to cook when you travel make sure you bring salt/pepper/oils...things like that as they are NOT part of his kitchen supply. Also, not sure If I missed it but I assumed there were TV's in each bedroom but there is only one in the living room so just a heads up. Also no patio furniture if you are wanting to sit outside."

Stayed with a pet","The air conditioner was so good. Beds frames are not the best but bed cover and pillow are great. Shower, shampoo, conditioner, and body wash smelled so great..
Things I think could make this the best is yard done and a new cleaning person.. adding TVs to the rooms would really help even a cheap small one . Towels need to be bigger and maybe had more room furniture like a dresser.. a few more pic on the. Walls to make it feel more like home.. chair and table out back would be nice."

Although, there were some dishes in the dishwasher that were dirty, I saw some old poop in the backyard, and the backyard had tall weeds and stickers that got into my dogs hair, also saw some cigarette buds on the patio. Overall the house is nice, just needs some extra attention in the backyard."

Stayed a few nights","Not a bad little house. In new development. Lots of tiny homes built very close together. Not a lot of privacy, especially in backyard at evening. Soft, comfortable beds. Soft, cool sheets. Perfect temperature control. Lots of flies, lots of neighborhood dogs kept in close proximity to each other, lots of barking, as well. House was clean, but minimal, only one tv. Master bath looks exactly like hall bath. Front yard a bit weedy. Back yard with beautiful, but tall grass. No lock on gate. No blind on back door. And so many chores… start laundry, strip beds, gather towels, wash dishes… And early check out time. Host is nice, very polite, always ready to chat, if need be; but does allow complete privacy."

The house is very clean and comfortable. Anna was fantastic at communicating and helping us with a last minute accommodation. We will be staying here again in the future when we come back to Levelland.

The only real issue we had were the neighbors across the street, who played extremely loud music late into the night (into the early morning hours). We contacted the police to have them intervene, but they were not deterred and the music continued. Of course, the noisy neighbors are not within the control of the hosts, but I thought it worth mentioning in case other guests are interested in the information."

Their little Backyard Barn is not only new but also spacious-yet-cozy. And, as a woman traveling alone this trip, I felt very safe and right at home! Bridgett & Kyle were amazing hosts and super responsive. They even dropped off a little goody bag the first morning of my stay with snacks, water and 3 freshly layed eggs! I had everything I needed from clear instructions on how to work everything to 4 different pillow types to choose from! The outdoor Edison lights lining their driveway to the cottage were warm and welcoming on nights when I returned late from business dinners or Tech basketball games. Their neighborhood of little ranchettes is very tucked away and private yet only about 4-5 miles from the Tech campus (so great when i wanted to go see my daughter) and really close to shopping, restaurants etc. Can’t wait to stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","AMAZING HOME! The place was better than the photos online. Jennifer was the most above and beyond hostess we have encountered. The list of available extras and necessities was top notch! From gum, cold waters, warm cookies and a very welcoming card; to shaving cream, extra toothbrushes, antacids, and allergy medication. Just wow! We booked this home while I was in town for a wedding. Two large mirrors and especially the outdoor area by the pool (which felt great), allowed for amazing photos. Lastly, the comfort and cool temp, which could be adjusted, made for a great sleep! Outside of the home, we were close to fast food and restaurants, grocery stores, and coffee (if you wanted something other than what was already provided). Very very convenient, safe, and quiet home. We would happily recommended this home and would love to book here again!
Thank you Jennifer for the amazing space you created, the quick responses, and simply being available to us when we needed it!🫶🏽"

Pros; great area, right off interstate, spacious rooms, large bathroom, kitchen and living area. Con's: laundry dryer vent doesn't go outside so if you have allergies, I don't suggest you use it. Walls are thin, and neighbors are either unaware, or ignorant. Jennifer is a great host, fridge broke, and she was able to replace it right away which was fantastic."

It was really cool to look out the window and see people riding, nice break from my city life in Ft. Lauderdale.

Loved the country location, and all other tenants in the building were polite and friendly. It was so fun to see the horses working in the arena, and stabled nearby. We felt extremely safe here. There was plenty of parking for my cargo trailer - a real plus. The walls are pretty thin, but we heard almost no noise from the other tenants. Beds were comfortable, the TV's were huge, loved having a washer/dryer, the bathroom and shower were spacious, the kitchen was large and stocked with all the basics - overall the place was much larger than we expected. Our only recommendation would be more comfortable seating for the small dining table and bar stools. Excellent host, very responsive. Thanks for a great stay!"

Stayed over a week","We stayed at Chilton house with my parents and our 2 children for a month. Overall, we liked the house very much and we felt very comfortable there.
Unfortunately, although no animals are actually allowed to find dog hair at check-in on some upholstery and cover. We also had to free the beautiful and really spacious garden from dog droppings before we could use it.
For our guests number, the equipment in the kitchen for self-catering was sometimes a bit scarce. Otherwise, the house is really super equipped.
So overall, we were happy with a few restrictions."

She truly has put thoughtful consideration into every detail—from the kid friendly plates in addition to the colorful Fiesta ware, the little lemon accents, backyard activities, and she even had the ingredients to build your own Chilton! AC worked great, linens were fresh and comfy, there was a pack and play and toddler potty seat! She truly has thought of everything! Will definitely book again!

Stayed a few nights","The Chilton House was amazing. Based on past experience, our expectations of Airbnb in the Lubbock areawere not high at all. But Sydney has an amazing offering. Not only is the house named after a famous....ish, drink discovered in Lubbock. But Sydney was kind enough to leave the ingredients for us to make a Chilton upon our arrival. And then we gave ourselves a tour and we were very happy with the place. The beds were extremely comfortable. My wife actually joked about taking the comforter home with her. Our daughter loved the 2 other bedrooms (somehow she used them both).
We were there to visit with family, so there was no cooking. But, the kitchen was stocked with everything you need, even if you want to BBQ. Sydney even provides coffee!
All in all, this was a great place just barely outside of Lubbock, on the best side of town. Stay with full confidence that your time here will be very comfortable."

Everything was extremely clean and all of the amenities were wonderful. The special touches we loved were the coffee and creamer and the Maki gs for our fave drink, the Chilton! Such cute lemon themed decorations! We will certainly consider the Chilton House on our next stay in Lubbock with our family. Sydney was a very responsive owner! Good job you guys and God bless. 🥰🙏🏻"

It was so welcoming and it felt like our home away from home! We also enjoyed meeting Christine and Keith they were so friendly and we enjoyed having conversations with them ! We enjoyed meeting all the animals and being able to access the shop. And the honey was absolutely amazing. We learned a lot about these that day. We are considering starting our own hive!

It was far enough to be alone while still close to everything the city had to offer, and the hosts were super friendly and wonderful to visit with but never intrusive. We had more than we needed at all times in every area possible also offering way more than any hotel I’ve ever stayed at! Their attention to detail and anticipation of their guest’s needs are impeccable and unmatched in my experience and global travel!!

Group trip","My husband and I and our 3 elementary age children stayed at Ahava Farm this weekend and we were quite impressed! We came into town for a family event, but we were concerned we wouldn't have anything to do, so the farm seemed like a good idea. And yes, it was! K&C were wonderful hosts and showed us and the kids around a few times over the course of our weekend there. The kids loved feeding the ponies, petting the bunnies and chickens, and loving on the goat. When I first walked into the cottage, I was amazed by the decor. It's just perfect. Pictures don't catch all the tiny details that are in this home. Finding ""bee"" items was a fun hunt! Even though I've only been in a handful of BRBs, I have not seen the hospitality that K&C gave us. They truly go above and beyond. With all the snacks, EGGS😂, honey sticks, and little gifts that Christine gave our kids, the value is well worth it. We created some wonderful memories on this little farm. Thank you K&C for your time and love!"

The house is absolutely beautiful and so relaxing. Save the bee toiletries are provided, along with anything you might have forgotten. I was overjoyed that the friends I brought this time loved it just as much as I had the first time I stayed there. If you get the chance to meet the hosts, they have the most beautiful stories to share. They also showed us the animals, which was a really fun part of our stay. Best advice I’ve seen is to stay more than one night! So glad we did!"

We were in for a gymnastics state meet in Lubbock and wanted to stay away from the hustle and bustle and we stumbled upon Ahava Honey Bee Farm. Keith and Christine went above and beyond for our stay. From the breakfast tacos and Kolaches at our front door one morning to snacks, drinks, and Christmas candy for us to enjoy we felt like we were at home. The cottage was beautifully decorated for Christmas and the bed downstairs was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in! Our youngest daughter cried as we said goodbye to this amazing gem we found. “ I want to stay forever mommy”, she said. We will be back if we ever find ourselves our that way again."

The detail that has gone into giving this space a welcoming and at-home feeling is beyond description. I can't think of a thing that I needed that wasn't available to me [i.e. make-up remover cloths, scissors (found exactly where I thought they'd be), big fluffy towels, great hot water, extremely comfortable bed, and the list just goes on and on]. In addition, Christine's incredible kindness and giving heart (I didn't get to meet Keith, but feel certain, he's just as kind) is a rare jewel these days. I definitely have hopes of returning!!!"

The details in the decorating are top notch. The house is private, comfy with a relaxing atmosphere. And as if the house was not perfect enough, the hosts are even more amazing. Great communication, we woke to fresh breakfast tacos on our porch after arriving very late the night before. They were both so open to share their love for the small farm and allow interaction with the animals. I would say we have new life long friends after our stay. I encourage you to take a detour just to stay with them and experience their hearts."

We stayed for 2 nights on our way back to Austin from Santa Fe and it was the perfect place to rest and rejuvenate. The house is joyously decorated, super clean, has fabulous beds and bedding, and is stocked with everything (coffee, milk, orange juice, all kinds of snacks, mini pizzas, popsicles, delicious lotions and soaps, and much more). It truly feels like a home, and not just a rental. The hosts are two of the kindest people you’ll ever meet. And, if you enjoy hanging out with animals, this is the place for you. The hosts gladly took us out both evenings to pet the goats, horses, and bunny rabbits. We got to watch the geese and chickens run around. What a perfect place to escape the hustle and bustle of the world—we loved it."

It’s super clean with quality furniture, linens, etc. and beautifully decorated with a lot of fun and interesting items. Their communication with us was detailed, quick and responsive.

Stayed a few nights","PERFECT FARM STAY. First of all, there was a major hailstorm coming in/around the Levelland area and Christine and Keith made sure to warn us about it when we were on our way. The storm could’ve caused a lot of damage to our car on , but we were able to find cover because they let us know ahead of time so we were super grateful. Anyway, these reviews are not exaggerating when they say how excellent this airbnb is. Christine and Keith are so kind and the animals are absolutely adorable and very playful. My fiancé and I had the best time - if we didn’t have time restraints, we would have extended our stay for at least a week. The airbnb is extremely clean and beautifully decorated. It smells really nice too. They have plenty of games (we played Levellopoly), kitchen is full stocked with spices, coffee, fresh eggs, fruits, and snacks. They even had a little medicine cabinet stocked up which I ended up needing because I forgot my antacids at the last airbnb I was at. Everything is very modern and new - the smart tv is big with Netflix already connected, tv has a sound bar, the toaster oven has an air frying function. Bed was incredibly comfortable. We were SO moved by their kindness and generosity. They gave us plenty of privacy and made themselves available when we asked to see the animals. We had so much fun. Be sure to check out Mosaic coffee shop, the sandwiches and soup were really tasty. This is the best airbnb we have ever experienced with so many personal touches, we so happy that we visited and we’re already thinking about when we can go back. Book immediately."

Stayed a few nights","Wow! What a great find! We've stayed in a number of AirBnB spots over the years, and had some great experiences, but THIS PLACE is in first place, by a long shot!
The house is super cozy and cute. We were so comfortable there. It would be a great place for a creative or spiritual retreat week, for sure. Isolated and quiet, but with the bees and farm animals nearby. Levelland is less than ten minutes away, with grocery and food options. We stopped in at the local coffee shop several times, and highly recommend it.
The location was perfect for us, as we had day-trip plans for Carlsbad Caverns, Palo Duro Canyon, and the Ranching Heritage museum in Lubbock.
Finally, the hosts are super kind and generous. Four nights here flew by, and this will be a stop if we find ourselves back in the area, for sure. If we didn't live 18 hours away, we'd be back even sooner! Highly recommend this place."

Jennifer had fresh eggs for us in the fridge and had baked a delicious cobbler that was warm when we arrived. The farm animals were a hit with the kids (13 and 15). Felt like home away from home. 100% will be back next time we are in Lubbock. Memories of a lifetime were made."

The Farmhouse is amazing with the views, animals, and the house. Our family was able to connect with Jen and John like we have known them for many years. They made sure we had everything we needed and if we forgot or needed anything we were able to borrow it. We can’t wait until we go back for our 3rd trip. They are like family now."

She loved feeding the animals and gathering eggs in the coop. Jennifer and John are excellent hosts, always responded immediately to any messages, and were amazing all around! We had our family over for meals and it was a perfect place to gather and spend time together. The house had everything you could possibly need, and more. The only thing we had to worry about was our food, but even then, the provided fresh farm eggs were the best! Oh, and the cherry cobbler was amazing! 🤤 We will definitely be back to stay again in the future!"

Stayed with kids","Wow. What an incredible experience we had while staying at John & Jennifer’s BEAUTIFUL farm house. It was truly that, an experience.
In every possible way, they exceeded our expectations. From hospitality to cleanliness - these hosts, and dare I say it - friends - were by far the most exceptional AirBnB hosts that I have ever had the pleasure of renting from. Coming from Dallas we wanted a location that was between Lubbock and Littlefield, fortunately we found this location right in between and just a mile off the highway. This house had history and has been tended to with love and a passion to share the relaxation of the outdoors with all. Jen & John had everything you need, and even prepared a delicious cherry cobbler upon our arrival. They were always immediately responsive and their home, along with the friendly and playful animals, was nothing short of exceptional. If you’re in the area, book this location as you will not regret it.
Thanks again, John & Jen - we will return!!!"

This is an old house built in the Great Depression era that was completely remodeled by a very great family who now hosts this property. They took care to preserve the history and special character of this home and it shows. We enjoyed the peaceful surroundings, comfortable beds, and especially our gracious hosts. This home will have everything you may need, from coffee makers, cookware, full sized washers and dryer, and even stuff you need but don’t remember like zip lock bags or even a new toothbrush for the family member who forgot to pack theirs. We really couldn’t have been more pleased with the quality and value of this stay."

Group trip","What a find!! The Farm is so much more than just an airbnb alternative to hotel rooms! Jen and John made us feel like we were their extended family staying in the guest house. We spent graduation weekend there and wanted to have an outdoor lunchtime cookout instead of fighting for restaurant reservations. We truly had everything we needed to function for this including an extra fridge/freezer and a stand-up freezer in the laundry room! The living room and bedroom furniture is super comfortable, and each room has well-developed theme decor that was lots of fun to explore. The farm animals are adorable and interactive, and several cats came to visit while we were out on the two patios."

Stayed a few nights","10/10! After original arrangements had been cancelled on me two days before our anniversary I thought I was doomed! My boyfriend and I are from Lubbock so we wanted to do a staycation. I friend sent me Jennifer and John’s listing and honestly it was the fresh eggs that sold me at first! I saw the location was 20-30 from Lubbock which had me concerned with driving late/if my partner and I wanted to go into town for nice dinner. We both decided getting “out to the country” and staying would be more fun.
Jenny had everything set up for us including fresh eggs and a cobbler🥰 She is a fellow teacher so I don’t know where she finds the time!!! Jenny was responsive and willing to go above and beyond for any of our needs! The home as very clean, well decorated, and very warm/ welcoming.
My partner and I’s favorite things were grilling and walking around the property feeding the animals treats. They also had plenty of movies and games.
We are already looking at dates to come back! Top ranking airbnb experience!!"

Everything you want and more than you need can be found in this beautiful home on the farm. My grandson loved the big yard, animals, tire swing and all the toys that he discovered during our stay. The beds were very comfortable with gret pillows and plenty of extra blankets. etc. The huge kitchen was fully stocked making any dinner you might want to cook doable. The 2 porches filled with tables and chairs made it easy to spend most of our time outside. Two refrigerators makes it easy to stock up for a big family fet together. The living room was very comfy and for the tv watchers Direct TV was ready to watch. I could go on and on about the farm and how great it is for a relaxing experience. However, I believe the cherry on top is Jennifer. Her love for the farm and her desire to share it made us feel like we were visiting family instead of a hostess."

What a unique spot filled with simple & unique moments. Every corner of the farmhouse & property is a treat! Jen, John, Parker & Chandler have created a peaceful, loving haven for all to enjoy! There are so many creative touches here, you will love wandering all over the property! & then there’s the chickens, goats, 6 cats & Chevy to enjoy too!
If you venture off the farm you’re only a short ride back to town or a couple of hours from Palo Duro or Caprock Canyon for amazing hiking!
Come & sit & breathe in all that is West Texas. (Best Texas!)

We were able to cook, do laundry, spend quality time with our freshman at Texas Tech for the UT vs Texas Tech game. We picked up the highly rated and delicious barbecue shack Friday night just a short drive away and enjoyed a private dinner at our farmhouse rental. The next morning we had farm fresh eggs from the cute happy hens. The best eggs I’ve ever had. I guess that’s about the time I discovered I did not bring a hair brush. Jen delivered a brush within minutes. She is a true blue happy host!
That day we drove to shop at a nearby outlet so my son could get winter clothing since Tech is much colder than Houston. All this made our trip so much more fun and relaxing.
We drove to the game and it was a short drive.
I can’t wait to go again!!
Thank you for such a fun and relaxing trip!

First of all, John and Jen are the most friendly, wonderful people you will ever meet, the type you will always remember. Their friendliness and hospitality made us feel like family the entire time we were there. The home is exceptionally clean and reminiscent of a well-maintained farm house complete with sealed oak floors, vintage decor from yesteryear, screened pantry, metal ceilings in kitchen; 3 bedrooms with comfortable bedding, large covered porch with rocker and large green lawn areas with shade tree; in a nutshell, an incredible throw-back to an earlier era incorporated with modern amenities. A fully stocked pantry and farm fresh eggs await the guest and more eggs are available at a nearby barn where the hens reside (no roosters so you can sleep in). This home is perfect for families or even couples for a great relaxation getaway in the company of most incredible hosts. You won't be disappointed. 5-Stars Plus********* Mike & Jean"

Stayed with kids","John and Jen were amazing hosts and the farmhouse was absolutely perfect for our family! The property is beautiful and so serene. It’s a twenty minute drive into town, but feels so much more remote than that. Perfect if you need a getaway from busy city life.
Breakfast on the porch was my favorite. Especially with the farm fresh eggs from their ladies (the chickens on site) :) If you enjoy porch sittin’ please book this place right now! You will not regret it!
The farmhouse itself is decorated so cute! Definitely has that cute farmhouse charm that Joanna Gaines would be proud of! It was very clean as well and the master bed (the only one we used this trip) was so comfortable. This place will give you rest and relaxation for sure.
Like I said John and Jen were excellent hosts and you can’t go wrong staying with them! You’ll enjoy every minute! We can’t wait to come back and stay at the farmhouse again :)"

Other then a couple dead spiders on the floor it was clean. Lubbock doesn’t get a lot of rain but it unfortunately rained every day we were there! The street floods pretty bad. And the front door/entry way stayed wet the whole time. The welcome mat never dried out and there was no entry rug inside to wipe feet on. Just a suggestion for future guests. Overall nice place and a good stay. Thank you!

Stayed a few nights","Great listing and very spacious. The home was very comfortable, and I slept well. The Wi-Fi was appreciated and great speed. I did a quick clean to feel at home. The location worked for me —not too much is more than a 15- minute drive in Lubbock. I would recommend and hopefully will stay again."
