Stayed a few nights",Back yard was disappointing and didn’t match pictures. Needed cleaning /mowing in the back or enough cleaning supplies (towels )for us to clean patio furniture. Bathroom exhaust fan was extremely dirty. We could have used a broom and dustpan to keep the floor clean from us and did best we could. Place was supplied for weekend or short stays. Rest of inside was nice and clean matching pictures. Suggest paper towels and drying rack for dishes for people with longer stays. A few small tweaks would have made our stay perfect.

Stayed one night",We only stayed on night at Olivia’s place but we could have easily stayed longer. The place is small but has every you need. Loved the view of the orchards outside the back door. It was raining so we didn’t get to hangout in the little backyard area. The cottage is quiet and felt very private. It was clean and elegantly decorated. It also had a great welcome book. Definitely go to Nomad if you are up for amazing food. It is gourmet dining so don’t expect to pay fast food prices but it was worth every penny.

Stayed over a week","This is a pleasant small cottage close to downtown Tieton. The bed was very comfortable. Her checkout instructions are very simple and don’t dump a lot of work on the guests, like some rentals do. We stayed for 12 days. The lack of a place to hang more than a couple jackets was the only thing we had to work around. The host is very responsive and helpful."

In addition to the incredible stay at Olivia’s place, we followed her recommendation and explored the quaint town of Tieton: what a hidden little gem!
Nomad was 5 star food and service for dinner and we had an incredible breakfast the next morning at Wallflower!
Another fantastic getaway! We are so grateful for Olivia’s cottage!"

Stayed one night",The shower had hair from previous guest upon our arrival. The bathroom mirror was streaked and dirty. Bathroom sink finish was chipped in several places giving it the appearance of not being clean. Toilet did not flush right. We reported the wifi was bad and it never really worked correctly on our phones. Host claimed this was not a problem with other guests . Afterwards I checked reviews and noticed at least one other person mentioned this too. Not set up for anyone to do much of anything simple in the kitchen. Dishes and silverware were not clean. Had to soak the coffee mugs to get the dirt scrubbed out of the mugs. Patio for guests was not set up as pictured. The table and chairs were in the back yard with a patio rug draped over them. Assigned parking space was located under a tree that needed trimmed so guests had to deal with the low branches being in the way. Not responsive to our emails. When we received her welcome greeting we indicated when we would be arriving.

The atmosphere in and out was cozy & peaceful, the bed was comfortable, and all amenities were clean & in good working order. The little wall heaters looked inadequate to the task, but in fact raised the temperature pretty quickly. The kitchenware was sufficient to put together two-person meals, but would be improved by the addition of a decent small paring knife and a sponge. We found the wifi spotty. The router is likely in the owner's adjacent dwelling; perhaps a network extender would help."

She is one of those people you wish you had the oppourtunity to get to know better...I could say the same about the whole staff at Bills Place, their bar and resturant (yummy pizza with artichokes).
Natalie created the rental as a space she herself would look forward to staying in. She nailed it ! I had inquired about larger pots and pans. Those culinary vessels where delivered the very morning!
It is perfect for one or two.
I felt completely safe as a single female traveler. My stay pleases me.

Upon arrival and collecting the keys we helped ourselves to a snack and some beverages @ the bar conveniently located in the same parking lot. Personally, I found Bills Place to be quite nice & not a “dive” at all. Likely, the largest selection of wines I’ve ever seen @ a place like it, which makes sense considering the awesome wine in this part of the world. Gilbert and Freehand Cellars are worth a visit and there’s some good Mexican Food available within a couple blocks walk. We enjoyed El Porton (huge portions) and Yakima Steak Company (very good steak). Natalie was very responsive and shared some good insights on what to do in the area. We enjoyed the enclosed patio as it provided the perfect sun spot in the afternoon to chill at. If we find ourselves in Yakima again, this would be my first choice."

Stayed a few nights","A great Airbnb for 1 or 2 adults in Yakima! There weren't a lot of great options in Yakima between hotels and other Airbnbs, and I'm glad I found this spot. The place was very clean, nicely decorated, and well-equipped with little thoughtful touches that made our stay really comfortable. I loved the nice clean bathroom, which had good lighting, an extra handheld mirror, lots of extra towels, and even lint rollers! I was also impressed that there were some live houseplants in the apartment. The owners care about this place! The kitchen was perfect for our needs, including a full-size fridge, dishwasher, and an oven/range. The bed was comfortable as well! There is a bit of street/car noise that comes through, but it didn't bother me (I'm used to living in a city). We didn't actually get to check out Bill's Place (the bar), but it looked cool, so hopefully next time! The apartment doesn't look like much from the outside, but it really is a nice place to stay."

The place was great, clean and comfortable, and very convenient to my work and just in back of Bill’s Place, a super fun bar with VERY good food. The only hiccup in my stay is that when I arrived at about 6 pm on Wednesday, there wasn’t any place to park because they were having 1/2 price burgers at the bar. It was kind of annoying but not a huge deal as I unloaded my stuff and then parked on the street until the bar emptied out. Natalie found out what happened and felt so bad that she comped me dinner at Bill’s Place the next night!
Thanks for such great hospitality and customer service Natalie!"

By far the best part was the bathroom it was the best sower I've ever had with how nice it was.

Stayed one night","Don’t be fooled by the neighborhood or the exterior. Do pony up to the bar at Dave’s Place for a beer and food. The clientele are locals and the staff know their names.
The unit was quiet, comfortable and had ample parking. The renovations beautifully planed and executed. Natalie was responsive to our questions and very pleasant. Now we need another excuse to visit Yakima."

Everything we wanted & more. It exceeded my expectations! Bill’s Place (a bar) across the parking lot was a vibe & amazing food too. No issues with noise & slept very well.

Natalie has really gone the extra mile with all the extra touches and has thought of everything. There is some road noise, so I was happy to have ear plugs and sound machine conveniently on the bedside table! Loved grabbing a drink at Bill’s Place and it’s a super easy walk into the heart of downtown. Will definitely stay here again next time I’m in town!"

Stayed one night","Thoroughly pleased, that's how I'd describe my feelings about my stay at Natalie's place in Yakima. Communication from the start--and throughout the stay--was very quick, sometimes measured in minutes. And it was always friendly. Everything was clearly communicated through texting with her or from the information she posted in the Airbnb website/app. The place itself was super-clean, and even better inside than it looked in the pictures. I was particularly impressed with many of the nice small touches she put into the place. Just walking into the space on a hot day, I got a very good vibe when I realized the room was pre-cooled to a calming 70 degrees. The only detail I think that could be a minus for some is the immediate surroundings. However, if you read the description, you will realize that your front area is a parking lot and you're a few steps away from a bar. This is, however, also a plus--depending on your way of thinking/living!"

Stayed over a week","Two week stay at Natalie's place and it was amazing. For a location where there's a fair amount of traffic around and a bar across the parking lot, the apartment itself was very peaceful to stay in and most of the noise wouldn't even be noticeable. Great location to start and end your day in, with great coffee across the road and Bill's Place to get some drinks in the evening and mingle with a lot of great folks. Good amount of food places and a small corner store/gas station within walkable distance as well.
The apartment itself was amazing and very well kept! Very clean, great modern kitchen, nice details and decorations to make it feel like a home away from home for my two weeks there. Overall just very very comfortable.
Natalie was an awesome host! Very friendly, very sociable and reachable, went out of her way with Doug to take me explore local breweries, and gave me great tips on what was happening in and around town during my stay.
Thank you Nat & Doug for an amazing experience!"

The place was pristine. Not only did it look like the photos, something about the space was extremely welcoming as soon as you walked in. (Maybe it was the air conditioning that was on when we got there 😂, it was hot that day!)
The room was very accommodating, it had everything you could need. You could really tell that Natalie and Doug put a lot of effort and thought into the place, even down to the minute details and amenities. (I was so grateful to find the ibuprofen after hanging out at the bar one evening!). It seems like Natalie and Doug really try to anticipate every need their guests might have.
The bed was super comfortable and the shower is AMAZING.
This place is definitely a 10/10, would highly recommend. We had such a great time, we are coming back for sure!"

The secure, gated entrance with a petite porch sitting area gives way to a perfectly beautiful, well-appointed and perfectly maintained living space. Comfortable, nicely decorated, and every detail thoughtfully done. The AC worked well and was a comfort coming in from a hot Yakima summer day. The bathroom is stellar with gorgeous fixtures and luxurious towels. It is nicer than many high-end hotels! Natalie is a host that clearly takes great pride in offering a lovely space with all necessities included. The industrial neighborhood is a mix of blue collar businesses and some other modest living spaces. It was quiet and our party of three women felt safe and secure. Natalie also made sure we had plenty of information about options for dining and enjoying local favorites. This listing is highly recommended!"

The selling point is ""Dive Bar"" but there is nothing ""Dive"" about this place!!! You get the ""Dive"" appearance of the bar being right in the middle of everything but it is actually very upscale. The staff is top shelf, they are polite and very attentive, drinks are delicious and plentiful, and the food is AMAZING!! Everything we had was perfectly prepared and delicious, we saw so many other dishes we wanted to try but ran out of time. We will definitely be going back !! The room was very modern and comfortable and extremely clean and peaceful. Natalie and Doug are wonderful people and hopefully you will get to meet them during your stay!! I can't say enough positive things about the entire visit, this was a definite winner in my book. We enjoyed delicious breakfasts at 2 close by cafes.Thank you Natalie and Doug!!!!"

Small touches like that are so appreciated. Nice firm mattress, large TVs in both rooms, very nice shower and bathroom, great kitchen, ample towels and linens -- we were very comfortable. Natalie was super easy to communicate with and very accommodating of our needs/timing of arrival. We would never think of staying anywhere else on future trips to Yakima!"

Stayed a few nights","I stayed here for three nights, while at a conference at the convention center. Three nights here was cheaper than two nights at the Holiday Inn downtown and I guarantee I got a better nights sleep than my colleagues who stayed at the Holiday Inn.
The staff at Bill’s place are so nice and accommodating. And Bill’s serves the beer burgers in Yakima.
The unit was very nicely appointed. Although I didn’t cook, the kitchen looked well equipped. The bed was comfortable and the mini splits work very well for both heating and cooling (I need both during my three days).
Downtown Yakima can be quite loud, but the unit as equipped with a white noise, machine and earplugs on the bedside table
I don’t often have caused him to Yakima, but the next time I’m in town I will certainly stay at Bill’s."

*Kitchen/living/dining: kitchen was well appointed and easy to use. Sofa bed was easy to convert.
*Bathroom: very well appointed with heaps of towels and good products
*Bedroom: bed is on the firm side but nice. There’s a bit of road noise and the provided earplugs sorted that out nicely. Linens were good quality and pillows plentiful.
*Neighborhood: the area is fairly industrial feeling but easy to walk through, though not picturesque by any means, to more lively parts of town. The bar itself was fun with quite good food. El Pastor, across the street, was good. The espresso stand just across the street was handy and decent.
Overall: the place itself is thoughtfully set up with an evident attention to detail and very comfortable. Natalie is a lamb. We’d stay again for sure!"

The bar has really good food, an extensive beer list, and (surprisingly) fantastic bourbon selection. the only thing to be careful of is that if you are traveling with kids under 21, options to dine out may be limited due to regulations regarding places that serve alcohol (under 21 not allowed). We skiied White Pass which was a perfect hour drive and returned to nice people, cold beer, and delicious food. Highly recommend for fun loving adventurous types."

And of course, we loved going to Bill's for burgers and beers. Our friends from Yakima came and met us for dinner and while they had to drive home, we were able to stumble home! Natalie was so helpful for check-in and she even gave us a heads up on road/weather conditions for our road trip. We felt so taken care of! Thank you for everything!"

There are a lot of high end fixtures and it was very nicely decorated. It felt like a luxury hotel. I was extremely impressed by how clean it was. The kitchen was also well appointed with coffee, tea, olive oil, and a few spices.
I had been traveling for about 12 days when I arrived here, and I had the best night's sleep. Everything was comfortable. My only wish was that I could have stayed longer!"

Everything was easy, from directions to get there, checking in, parking, etc. Even though we were only there one night, I could see staying there multiple nights with great comfort. The kitchen is wonderful, the bathroom has a great shower, the bed and pillows are perfect. Doug greeted us when we pulled in and Natalie came by a little later. Very nice people! Bill’s Place next door has delicious food and friendly staff. Top notch place!"

This is easily one of the most attractive and well set-up Airbnbs I've stayed in. There is space for luggage and for toiletries, there are outlets everywhere, the heating and cooling works well and is easy to control, parking is easy, the space is lovely without being busy or fussy, and the shower is like something out of a luxury hotel. And the bar across the parking lot is awesome (dive bar vibe, but with 30+ craft beers on tap, a good selection of local wine, and gourmet bar food)."

As long as you understand that it is a work in progress there should be no complaints. It is a little close to a well traveled road, but the noise did not bother me. Jeff even brought ambient noise machine for those who need them. The furniture was comfortable and relaxing. I made great use of the BBQ and had several friends over one night and we had everything needed for a small get together. I was there by myself, but there is plenty of space and lots of games for a larger family. Jeff was super nice and very responsive. Would definitely stay again!"

It was on a quiet street, easy to find, and checking in and out was simple with no long cleaning list to worry about.
Inside, the kitchen was newly done up and had everything we needed. There were big spaces for hanging out on both the main floor and the basement. We didn’t use the outside area because it was cold, but it looked great for parties in warmer weather. This place is a really good deal for big groups coming to Yakima – it’s comfortable and has everything you need."

We were in town for a funeral for a loved one and to visit with family we don’t get to see very often and the open concept of the living spaces allowed us to all be together even when cooking and lounging in the living room which was very important to us. It was easy to make yourself at home here.
The kitchen was also fully stocked with all appliances, cooking utensils, dining wear, spices and coffee.
The beds were cozy with lots of extra pillows and blankets as well as extra charging cords for all of our devices and the bathrooms were very clean and well stocked as well.
If I had a question or needed anything, Heather was very responsive and so sweet. I thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Yakima and will DEFINITELY be booking a stay here again the next time we come to visit.

The beds were SO big and so comfy and I loved the pillows. There was extra blankets and pillows and so many towels. They had sanitary napkins and cleaning supplies which in some houses are none existent. The area downstairs is so cozy and perfect for lounging on the couch and my sister and I used the extra beds for quiet reading time. The downstairs was cobweb free which was awesome because I’m afraid of spiders! They had some dog supplies which I’ve never seen in a house before. The house was so clean probably one of the cleanest houses we have stayed in before. The backyard was amazing and loved the gated backyard because I didn’t have to worry about our dogs running away. I honestly don’t think we had any complaints. It was perfect and your family should stay here!"

Heather was very quick to respond with any question we had about anything at all, and even allowed us early check in. I would 100% stay again and recommend to anyone!"

Plenty of room for everyone, it was so cozy you didn’t want to leave. It had all the listed amenities and more. Heather was a fantastic host and was even gracious enough to mail us some forgotten items. Our only regret is that we didn’t stay longer! Will definitely book again, hopefully for at least a week!"

The backyard is especially restful and bucolic with a running stream, fully fenced (with no gaps for even a toy breed dog), comfortable, complete privacy, and with plentiful patio furniture and cookout equipment. The patio is secluded, covered, and there is ample lighting. The interior of the house is impeccable and the kitchen is fully equipped."

There are spacious living areas upstairs and downstairs, as well as in the fun extra ""room"" in the backyard. Heather was very accommodating and responsive.

The backyard isn't huge, but it is charming, beautiful and private whether you want to sit on the covered patio or by the pretty fountain, grill dinner or play a game of corn hole. The house itself has everything you need. The kitchen has plenty of dishes, glasses, cookware, dishtowels, etc. not to mention cooking staples. The bedrooms are clean, comfortable and even include charging stations. The house is beautifully decorated in a way that makes you feel at home while still being pampered.

Just a suggestion though that the host should add a portable grill w/ a wire & bigger pots/pans of some kind so guests can use it to cook for a group as there are not many food options around the area."

She also allowed us to park a vehicle there prior to our check-in time. This was really helpful for us as we were going to a concert up at the gorge amphitheater. We were also able to come back late at night and she was fine with us doing that. It was very quiet And we would stay there again
Thank you

Stayed a few nights","This house was in a great location, close to grocery stores, Starbucks, and other things. Quiet neighborhood. The yard was very beautiful and inviting. I wish it had been warmer so I could have sat on the patio in the morning and enjoyed my coffee, it was so beautiful.
There were a few things that I recommended to Autumn for the next guests, and she promptly got right on them. The heating ducts in the kitchen were quite noisy, and woke me up one morning, thinking that someone was in the house, but it was just the heater coming on and rattling things in the kitchen. Couldn’t believe how large the TV was in the living room, but if you don’t have a streaming thing, then there’s not much to watch due to the inability to have over the air or cable TV in that location. But that is explained in her description. I thought Autumn was very friendly and responsive and would not hesitate to stay here again. Thank you."

We especially enjoyed the east facing backyard with the morning light in the kitchen. The lawn was freshly mowed when we got there and it was obvious the house is well taken care of.
The kids enjoyed the bunk beds, kids books, and the games. The house felt roomy with just 4 of us and was very comfortable.

We went to several breweries (the goal of our visit) and hiked in the Canyon.
We enjoyed TAMALES in Union Gap and lots of MEXICAN food. (also a goal of the visit).
The Greenway Trail along the river is great. Bring a bike or walk/run. We parked at the Arboretum.
Yakima is becoming one of our favorite long weekend destinations because of the beer and wine in the area.
NOTE...there's only one bathroom...so if your group is LARGE...keep that in mind."

Every rooms comes with its own TV, so we never had to argue about which show or movie to watch. It was like having your own retreat. I had to work the entire time that I was there, and I never felt uncomfortable. It was probably due to the fact that home had great air conditioning and comfortable furniture. Overall amazing stay."

Stayed with kids","I really wanted to like this place, but it was pretty bad. The house itself was fine, it was cute and pretty tidy, tvs in every room, lots of dishes etc. There was a lot of hair in one of the beds and the bunk bed is so rickety it seems dangerous. I could have overlooked that but the house stinks soooo bad. It smells wet and musty which is strange because Yakima is a pretty dry place, not much humidity. We left there Monday and four days later, my hair still reeks of this house. I’ve washed it multiple times too. All of our clothes, suitcases, back packs, jackets, everything still reeks of this house even after washing. I spoke with the owner about it and they knew of this issue. They knew the bunk bed wasn’t sturdy. Autumn was very nice about all of my concerns and very responsive, but they still know about all of these issues and rent the house out anyway. I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s some serious mold in the house. They even have moisture absorbing bags in every single closet. They know there’s a problem."

Interior design is a plus too. It’s simple, fashionable and unique. Close to everything. Hosts are great and even welcomed us with tasty blueberry muffins. Everything that we needed was provided. We will definitely come back next year🥰"

Traveling for sports so safety is important due to late games and I felt safe in the building however the parking lot could use more light at night.
The room had everything I needed and the surrounding area had plenty of eateries close. Someone posted about the water pressure but it didn’t bother us. Everything worked and it was quite cozy!
Will be checking availability the next time we travel!"

Stayed a few nights","Location was good with a lot of restaurants within walking distance. The space was neat and tidy and spacious for my husband and me. While I felt safe when in the building (you have to go through 3 locking doors to get to the apt.), I would not feel safe staying here alone, without my husband. The homeless people we encountered didn't give us a second glance, but we did have to ask a woman to leave as she was taking shelter right in front of the front door. There is also a lot of noise, some of it unpleasant, from the residential unit next door. Hosts were very prompt with their communication and even allowed for an early check-in. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would consider returning in the future."

We walked to Single Hill Brewery a couple of times (dog friendly and so lovely!) as well as various other restaurants on the strip (there are so many options to choose from- we recommend Mak Daddy’s coffee and Mi Savin Mexican - both are fabulous). This is a great spot and we’ll definitely stay again if we find ourselves in the PNW again!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a really neat stay in a converted church!
I stayed 2 days and really enjoyed the renovated studio -- it was very spacious! It was well stocked with utensils and kitchen ware, and the bed was comfortable. I was grateful for the provided earplugs as there is a group home (or something similar) next to the church, so there is a bit of human activity right outside the window (people out smoking and homeless, the latter of which I was prepared for from other reviews and the listing). The only detractor was the shower -- although the bathroom is spacious, the shower head had very low water flow with erratic spray and only 1 setting, which made bathing a longer-than-expected experience.
For a stay in Yakima, I really enjoyed how easy the location was to find, the parking was convenient, and I found it very walkable to get food and explore. The next time I'm in town, I'd love to say here again!"

The location is perfect , you’re in walking distance from a couple wineries and you’re a 10/15 minute drive from downtown Yakima. They give you plenty of recommendations for places to eat and what to do , i recommend checking that part of it out once you book because i discovered places in the Yakima area that i had no clue existed and I lived here for 2+ years. All in all if you’re looking for a place to stay in Yakima that has everything you need , Cc’s place is the place to stay. Look at all the other reviews, they say the same things. Very consistent and beautiful place to stay at, will be back for our next trip to Yakima."

Comfy bed and couch, huge viewing window, outside seating and fireplace...a cherry orchard fills the view! Lovely shower and bathroom too. Kitchen is fantastic. The location makes it a perfect base for exploring the Yakima Valley and their online Guidebook is a great reference for wineries, breweries and dining (at wineries & breweries, lol). Step outside the front door and look to the right for a view of Mt Adams...look straight ahead for a beautiful valley, canal and river view. Loved our time here!"

The communication with the host was top-notch and they went above and beyond to share more about the location, the details, and amenities. The place was so cool and comfortable, and felt like the perfect getaway. We walked for about 15 minutes down the canal to the local tasting room, Freehand Cellars, and had a wonderful evening there, then hung out at the Airbnb in their two chairs by the firepit. The attention to detail from the hosts was what really set this place apart - the home is designed beautifully, there are excellent toiletries and accompaniments, etc. If you are looking for a getaway with fun wineries, hikes, and relaxation, then don't look anywhere else.
P.S. Before we booked this, I asked my husband if we were willing to spend $50+ more for something really special because I had a hunch it was going to be a much better experience than some of the other listings. I am so glad we spent more!"

We would highly recommend Cc’s space to anyone, and would definitely stay longer next time. Having local wineries and a fantastic pizza place nearly was also a great selling point!

Stayed a few nights","We loved the location and the ambiance, the patio area with sun shade, chairs, and a fire pit. We wish we had more time to enjoy everything. The host was super friendly and welcoming.
The only thing we wish for is for the place look a little more like a guest house rather than a converted garage. You drive past a beautiful house on the hill with a deck with a great view, and then realize this is not where you're actually staying but in what looks like a garage down the driveway. The first impression is ""Did I make a mistake?"". However, once you see the patio view on the side, the contemporary way the building was remodeled, park and walk in, all concerns go away as the living space is really cool and very comfortable. Also, the views are amazing!
All in all, a really positive experience, and we look forward to coming back someday when we can spend more time enjoying everything on offer."

We ate at the pizza spot at the bottom of the hill and were happy with it. We can't wait to visit again and check out the local wineries! Overall, highly recommended."

Wine and wine glasses were ready, bed was comfy, towels were fresh and fluffy, reclining couches allowed us complete relaxation with cozy blankets, while watching a whole movie without interruptions! Conveniently located near some of our favorite wineries, as well! We loved that they thought of everything! Popcorn for the movie, water and snacks. It also smelled amazing! We didn’t cook during our stay but everything you could need is there! I loved everything so much we took photos of different product so that we are able to buy, and I may have even requested links on pillows and bedding!

We saw the other reviews about barking dogs and that is still a thing (off and on all night nearby) but price reflects it. Josh was responsive about the very strong odor of cleaning/Febreeze air fresheners/detergents so that should be better for others after us. It is as advertised and the price reflects location but we felt safe there.

Stayed a few nights","Josh has done great things with this rental. The interior was comfortable and extra clean. Even the mattresses were nice to sleep on. I think they have done everything possible to make it comfortable inside. I loved the big bathroom as well.
The one thing that cannot be changed about the place is the location. It is commercial/industrial and that is what you see out every window. We weren't comfortable opening any windows because of the views and occasionally the people driving by/stopping. One night, two of the neighbor's guard dogs barked all night long which made it incredibly difficult to sleep.
Overall, it is a decent value for what is offered, but I would choose to pay a bit more to be in a better location where security and noise were less of an issue."

Stayed with kids","Josh's place was a great little spot for us to sleep a couple nights while in town for a marching band competition. Inside was very clean and appeared newly remodeled. Everything was clean and tidy, and it had some basic cooking items. Perhaps oddly specific, but the non-stick pots and pans were AMAZING, lol.
The only weird part is that it's located in an odd part of town. Not sure what Yakima is doing with their zoning laws, but this house is smack in the middle of a fairly industrial area (with other mixed residential dwellings). The property is fenced and it has a full-on security system, which is great, but it feels a bit intense. It was nice to park our vehicle behind the locked gate. I think the price very much accounts for this oddity and I think staying here was an exceptionally good deal. It's also VERY close to the historic downtown area, which was really nice.
For our use case of just spending a couple days in town, this worked really well!"

Safety was great as well - there was a working alarm system & a gate we could lock as we came in/out of the house. Would love to stay here again if/when I am back in Yakima - thank you Josh & team for wonderful weekend accommodations!"

No kitchen, but there is a microwave (as advertised). The bed is new and comfortable. Water pressure in the shower could be better, but there's plenty of hot water. Parking is off street and there is a light over the door if your arrive at night. Erik was very responsive and kept in touch throughout my stay. Will definitely book again when I go to visit my family."

The bed was incredibly comfortable, the decorations were beautiful, furniture was excellent quality, and everything was spotlessly clean. The instructions were clear, and the amenities, including snacks, drinks, Wi-Fi, and streaming services, made it feel like a home away from home. The spaciousness, quietness, and safe location with easy parking were perfect. The owner was flexible and accommodating, even allowing me to check in early for a stress-free wedding weekend. Best communication I have ever received from a host. I'll definitely be staying here again next time I'm in town!"

The home felt like home and was stocked with all the little things you could hope for. Before we left the kids were already asking when we could come back! We all loved our time away at this home!

Stayed with a pet","Robin's Nest was so perfect for our stay! Sherry has truly made an accomodation that feels like home away from home. We take our dog with us 95% of the time, so have stayed at a myriad of ""pet friendly"" locations, but Robin's Nest is by far the best Yakima has to offer with; dog beds up & downstairs, food/water station, designated pooch towels & most importantly, a FULLY fenced back yard. The was only the 3 of us (2 bipeds & 1 quadruped), so had plenty of room. The balance Sherry created maintaining the character of an adorable, older house while beautifully outfitting with updated fixtures, faucets & appliances throughout is nothing short of amazing to me. If family hadn't been the reason we made the trip, we might not have left the property. It's in a tucked back, peaceful neighborhood & centrally located for easy access to anywhere in town. We have only praise, no complaints. Hope that we will be welcome back, because I know where I want to stay anytime we're in Yakima from now on."

As others have stated the bathroom fan is attached to the light and is pretty loud- we opted to use the vanity mirror light most of the time and that was great. We did not utilize the ample backyard but it looks like a great place to relax on a nice day.
Honestly I felt just like I was staying at a friend’s house while they were away- would definitely stay again. Thank you for offering up such a charming well-appointed home."

Stayed one night","Was a nice older quaint home in West Yakima. All hardwood floors though out the house. Nice gas stove and big refrigerator to use. Would have been nice not to have to go down the basement stairs to watch tv, especially for those with difficulty of managing stairs. Would have like to have had a light directly above the nice gas stove as the kitchen lighting made it sort of difficult to really see what you were cooking on the stove top. The ac was nice and it kept the place at the proper temp for summer day in August. There was a large back yard with a nice looking patio area, which we did not use. Slept with the windows open at night and you could hear the frogs croaking. Neighborhood was quiet as well."

Stayed with a pet","Came to Sherry’s Robin’s Nest for a weekend of wine tastings. Her place is in a perfect location for traveling to all the vineyards in Yakima, Zillah and Prosser. Sherry was very flexible for our check in, since we were traveling from the West side of Washington. If you are checking in with a pet, which we were, she has a very big fenced in backyard, and she had pet beds and feeding dishes all set up. A very pet friendly place for sure. The house is located in an old established neighborhood that’s very quiet and has lots of personality, as is Robin’s Nest itself. It certainly is a place we will stay in again when we travel for our vineyard excursions."

Stayed with a pet","Sherry was so kind and made us feel right at home. She set out two dog beds for our dog, had tons of linens and blankets, and everything we needed for our stay. Water pressure was awesome, which was great after long days of golfing and walking the area.
The neighborhood was so nice and residential, while still being just a few blocks from Franklin park, which has tennis and pickle ball courts, as well as a ton of space to play fetch with our dog. The back yard was also great for our pup and had a covered area where we ate and took calls throughout the day. The neighbors were kind and friendly, and the entire stay really made us feel at home. Less than 15 min to anywhere in Yakima!
We loved Sherry’s recommendations and appreciated how responsive she was when we messaged for her other recs and information. She was so kind to offer recommendations for things we were interested in personally.
We’re house hunting in the area and would stay again if need be! :) thank you Sherry!"

Only suggestion for future guests would be to bring some sort of power strip if you're going to be charging things at the outlets are pretty old and plugs slip out of them easily. We wish the winery stayed open just a tad later but knew it would be sleepy during the off season.

The views are gorgeous, the winery next door is delicious (we bought a bottle of Syrah to take home), and the space itself is so warm, welcoming, and clean. Our stay was so restorative that we didn’t even explore the area as much as we had planned - everything we needed for an amazing visit was right there on the property. We’re already dreaming about our next stay!
Don’t miss a hike up to the top of the hill past the orchards for beautiful views of the mountains!"

The hot tub was perfection, and the winery had the most beautiful outdoor area at the tasting room. We had such lovely sunsets with the tasting room (outside area) all to ourselves after hours and THEN we just happened to be there when they had their second Moonlight party. The belly dancers were goddesses, the DJ knew exactly who was on the dancefloor (all my fellow 30-40 year olds, we all felt like we were back in college) and then they brought out delicious macarons, it just felt like someone's wedding. My girlfriends and I had the absolute BEST time, thank you so much. I highly recommend staying here! And the coffee recommendations were spot on."

Our only ""complaint"" is the furniture, though everything is in great shape, it was all very uncomfortable. The bed was way too small, sure wish it was a king.
Seriously it was a great stay!

Stayed a few nights","We absolutely loved our friend-cation at Freehand Cellars! The place was so spacious and adorable. I don't remember seeing the arcade machine in the listing, but we LOVED that it was there! I especially loved having our own private hot tub! We opted for the delivered wine tasting, and when there was a hiccup in delivery, the tasting room was quick to bring it over when we called to inquire. It was so special to have the wine tasting and snacks delivered to us! The kitchen was fantastic and had all the amenities. The couch was big enough for us both to sprawl out. Beds comfy. We loved it all!
Just a note, we could hear the neighbors in the attached duplex the first night while we were watching TV in the living room. They weren't unnecessarily loud, I think there were just a handful of them and the sound carried. For us, their conversations were hilarious but the wrong tenants could be less fun probably.
Would stay here again, loved the space and the amenities!"

I think it's worth noting the private hot tub is private in that you don't have to share it with any other guests of the property but it's not necessarily private from view of the tasting room or driveway. I'd definitely stay here again in the future if I'm in the area.

Stayed a few nights","My partner and I spent Christmas in Unit A on the vineyard and it was absolutely perfect. The kitchen and living room was spacious, the appliances were fantastic, the kitchen was fully stocked in tools so I was able to prepare meals with ease, and the bed was so comfortable!
It was super cold, but we made use of the spare blankets and spent plenty of time in the hot tub overlooking the valley. It was so gorgeous. Eduardo even left a note wishing us a merry Christmas, set up a tree, and left us some holiday cookies! We weren’t able to be with family for the holiday, but Eduardo made us feel right at home.
The tasting room we didn’t take advantage of, but it was only steps away from our front door. They even had EV charging spots!
10/10 would book again."

I walked in and immediately started crying it was so beautiful. And although tears were not hard to come-by that weekend, they were the only ones I’d consider happy. I cried again when it was time to leave. Endlessly thankful for the peace and healing this home provided ❤️‍🩹"

Stayed one night","A family member had a volleyball tournament in Yakima, and we decided to head over to see her play! It was fairly last minute, but fortunately there was a beautiful house available about 10 minutes away. I read the reviews, checked out the maps and it looked perfect. About a day before, we saw that the game started at 8am, but the house was rented the night before...but Eduardo helped us with another rental they owned on the property (booking through airbnb of course) and even offered to help move our luggage between rentals (we didn't have much since we were there for such a short period). If you are looking to cook at all during your stay, the kitchen is incredible! Very modern, all the appliances you would need and the view from the dining room table - is impressive. Honestly, they have everything you need for all rooms and more! Definitely will stay again when we go to Yakima :)"

Only things were not a lot of seasoning for food, no blender, water pressure was a little soft but it was nice and hot. And omg I forgot to mention the AC WAS a LIFESAVER because the weekend we stayed was upper 90s-100s but the ac felt amazing. Overall amazing stay, views for days!"

My friends and I enjoyed our stay and the ability to explore and have the property pretty much to ourselves outside of Freehand tasting room hours was perfect. There are 2 other airbnbs on the property. One next door in the duplex, the other out of sight. The Freehand staff were all very friendly. The patio is not private as the duplex is next to the tasting room. It did not bother us, we explored during the day. Again had the place for hours in the morning and after 7 or so. Kitchen well equipped for cooking. Pantry items supplied: coffee, sugar, creamer, salt and pepper. Shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and laundry supplies provided as well. If you are looking for completely updated and immaculate property, this may not be for you. Mid century modern/grandmas house vibe with updated kitchen. All the amenities needed being away from home, hot tub was nice too. Would definitely stay again!"

Stayed one night","We enjoyed our overnight stay at Eduardo’s place at Freehand Cellars and wished we could have stayed another night as originally planned (no fault of the host). After a very long drive we enjoyed a delicious charcuterie plate we purchased next door at the tasting room. And had we been able to stay longer we would’ve enjoyed more time at the tasting room with its beautiful view and comfortable seating. Had the weather been warmer we would have spent more time on the deck & enjoyed more of the lovely view across the vineyard. And, although we didn’t make use if it that night we did have a nice hot tub. On a clear night the stars must be awesome! The beds were extremely comfortable and the living room spacious but not particularly cozy, the kitchen full of light, very spacious with a nice view from the table. Having two bathrooms with showers was a plus but the shower door & faucet in one could use a little TLC or updating to make them a little easier to manage. Although we never saw our host, Eduardo’s communication was very good with us and directions very clear on how to get there and get in."

The rental itself is as described, we thoroughly enjoyed the fabulous view, hot tub, orchards and vineyards, we made dinner on the first night in the upgraded kitchen and it had everything we needed to make a delicious meal. We liked the bed, it was firm and we had a good night's rest. We got up early the second day to enjoy our coffee and the sunrise which was lovely. We drove a short distance to Union Gap for takeout and came back for the sunset. All in all a very relaxing time and would stay here again. Thank you for hosting us."

It is more than spacious enough to accommodate you and some friends, or if you’re just there with your family. The hot tub is great and comes with a view. And you can’t beat having good wine right next door."

Stayed about a week","This was our 2nd stay. The grandkids loved the hot tub & new arcade games. Kitchen is huge with everything needed to cook a meal. Host always responds in less than an hour. Fun winery just steps away, but the set up maintains maximum privacy. Love, love, love it!"

Stayed a few nights","Pros:
- The location was very convenient to both the Rattlesnake AVA/Yakima Valley and the city of Yakima.
- The views from the deck over the valley were beautiful, in particular towards sundown from unit A. The deck included a larger hot tub which was very relaxing to use in the evenings.
- The unit was spacious and a lot of natural light in the living space, while the rooms faced north keeping them more secluded from the light.
- Modern TV and comfortable couch were very nice to have in the evenings to relax and enjoy a glass of wine. There was also a Nintendo gaming machine that we did not use, but looked pretty cool.
- Full selection of cooking/eating/drinking materials, although one of the saute pans was no longer flat making it hard to use effectively.
- Eduardo was very responsive and getting in/out of the place was a breeze. Note that parking is not available next to unit, but you can load/unload and it is a very short walk to the parking space.

Cons:
- The unit looked and felt somewhat dated and there were areas that appeared to need repair/upkeep. There have been updates in places, such as the cabinetry in the kitchen, but many much older fixtures/areas that could be improved. For instance, the sliding door in the shower is no longer on tracks and is difficult to open/close and there was no pillow variety available, which didn't work for everyone.
- While it feels secluded, the road noise from the highway out on the deck is very noticeable, especially in the evenings.
Summary: While we would not likely stay again in Unit A as a two-some, it is a good unit especially if you have a child with whom could take advantage of the twin beds and gaming machine, or a larger group. We are very interested in the Airstream option at Freehand as well, which was not available for our stay. The hot tub and view are great and it has all the right pieces, it just needs a little more work to make it great."
