Stayed a few nights","My husband and I traveled to Texas to visit family. Allen’s place was the perfect spot to come back to and relax. We enjoyed taking a trip out on the lake on the kayaks and had a nice time swimming in the pool. The pool/patio area is absolutely beautiful with a great view of the lake. The guesthouse was clean, comfortable, private, and well-stocked to suite all of our needs. It was a fantastic trip."

Stayed a few nights","Everything was wonderful! The place was just what we needed where we needed it! We will definitely return and highly recommend to others. The only issue we had was being unable to connect to the wifi and not getting a reply to our request for help. I believe the communication issue might be with the airbnb service rather than with April as everything else she was responsible for was stellar. We had good cell signal, so I was able to use my hotspot as a backup for the work I had to do. The kitchen was well stocked including aluminum foil and saran wrap. The beds were very comfortable, but if you like a soft pillow, bring your own. One of the things I do for a living is cleaning. This place was PERFECT! I highly recommend this property! You will be glad you chose this one!"

Stayed with kids",We loved our stay. The home was spacious with lots of family gathering space. We fully utilized all the amenities. Our grandkids ventured on to the lake in the peddle boat and had a blast. Darts on the back deck were a hit as well. A tree had blown down in the yard a few days before our arrival and our host had a team cleaning it up the day we arrived. The workers were conscious of our small children and marked the area well with caution tape. There was plenty of covered parking and the flat driveway even allowed for a quick game of basketball. Thanks for a great respite from a busy wedding weekend schedule.

Stayed with kids","Great spacious property with plenty of parking. Deck area was perfect for guests comfortably chilling outside. The complaints I have are…there were only two towels on each bed that’s kinda a problem when there are 10 guests staying with the amount of money we paid I feel like we shouldn’t have had to go purchase towels to shower. We also had to purchase toilet paper this property should provide all necessities or let it be known before booking. My biggest complaint about this stay was the PET HAIR…there was dog hair on every single piece of furniture in the house whoever stayed there before us had to have had a large hairy dog or maybe even two and they slept on every bed in the house as well as the sofa the cleanup crew apparently didn’t clean up very well because we had dog hair on our clothes in our hair as well as our food. The more we sweep the more came out we swept a lot, and we were still not able to get rid of the dog hair. other than that our stay was nice."

Stayed with a pet","Pros: early checkin, stocked with Toilet paper/kitchen items/appliances, open living room/kitchen area, games/lake amenities, toddler cups/utensils
Cons: backyard was hard for toddlers to play because of big holes/ant piles/acorns completely covered many spots making it feel like you were walking on marbles(needed a rake),dock is a bit hard/weird to get on/off of, there’s a gas smell from stove unless you go outside to manually turn off the switch which we werent aware off (needs a sign by stove), needs a highchair, kitchen chairs are all wobbly/need tightening, 2 bedrooms have exterior key locks meaning if someone accidentally locks it there’s no way to get in without calling locksmith (we had no luck)/breaking the doorknob. Delayed response from host & felt like it was forced on us to financially take steps to fix the situation since they couldnt find the keys. This situation ruined our last night as a family. This could be a dangerous/expensive if a child got locked in so caution!"

We felt right at home and it was convenient to get to Anvil Brewing in Pittsburg and Los Pinos winery. Great place to unwind and hang out. Renato was super responsive to the few inquiries we had and the check in/check out process couldn’t have been easier. Awesome place!"

Kitchen had all we needed to fix dinners plenty of room. The Stove is gas that was nice, but the microwave is above it LOL I had some issues, I am short >>>>>>>>> and stout and it was hilarious.
They had paddle boat but it was not lake ready it was taking in water. I notified the Renter, and he assured me that it would be replaced. They had life vests, boards etc.
They have a game room with a nice view and things to do.
We loved it .................. it's too far east for us, but if you are near it's a great hide away very quiet Two car garage w/car port."

Stayed with kids",Perfect getaway! This room was awesome. All of us - the adults and the kids - loved it. The location was great - right next to the serene lake. You get a beautiful view of the lake right from the living room. The small fire pit in the backyard was nice. The game room in the back was a good value-add. The host was very responsive - provided great customer service. We would definitely recommend this room to our friends and family. The only problems (minor issues considering the many positives) we had were 1. Slowness of the wifi connection (for streaming services on TV) 2. the ball pieces on the foosball table were missing. Thanks a lot to the host for the wonderful experience!

Group trip","We were three older (!!) couples in the area for a tent revival. The home was 4 miles from the venue which made it closer than any hotel!! We had a great time on this short two night visit. It was great to sit on the deck and visit for hours and have morning coffee overlooking the gorgeous lake. Loved having a garage for the car! It's a beautiful home and it was perfect for the six of us. We will definitely rent if back in the area and...there was talk of it being a great place for a family reunion!! AND, the fat cat that showed shortly after we arrived was fun for us cat lovers! Pictures and description are right on target!"

Stayed with kids","Home was spacious, comfortable and well stocked. The deck and lake view was wonderful. Very relaxing. Internet was a constant problem. Hosts tried their best to fix it but the remoteness and power lines make getting good signal very difficult. We were unable to use the lake as described. It is not a safe lake for swimming or boating due to the large number of trees under the water. It would probably be good for fishing. Overall it was a nice getaway for our group."

The kitchen was well stocked with plenty of cooking utensils, dishes etc. There was plenty of room for our family of six including 2 teenage boys. The fact that our two dogs were welcome made it all perfect. Even though we visited during one of the hottest weeks of the year we were able to find things to do nearby. If you have the opportunity to visit the area be sure to check out Daingerfield state park and Lake Bob Sandlin. Both are beautiful areas. Would love to go back to the area when it’s much cooler."

Group trip","We loved this house. The view of the lake somehow manages to perfect at every hour of the day. The house decor is beautiful and the kitchen was well stocked with utensils and cookware (plus lots of mugs for us all. day coffee drinkers). Every one of my family members said the loved the place. The beds were comfortable and the place was spotless when we checked in.
The location was ideal for us, close to both Pittsburg and Mount Pleasant. We were attending my daughter's wedding and spent a week at the property but never felt we we far away from any of the pre-wedding events, everyone absolutely loved the Rodeo in Mount Pleasant and the cowboy themed rehearsal dinner at The Anvil in Pittsburg.
Renato was very responsive to the one or two questions we had before arrival and, the true sign of a great host, we had no need to contact Renato during our after arrival as the house details were very clear and all the little things were done right, switches labeled etc.
10 out of 10 of the house guests loved the property (so much so one of them joked my niece should marry one of groomsmen so we could do it all again next year).
I would absolutely rent this property again."

Stayed a few nights","The perfect getaway destination. We rented this house for a few days as a place for our families to gather from various out-of-town locations. We've stayed at several houses on another local lake, and this Lake Welsh destination is one we'll stay at again. The size of the house is great, with four bedrooms and three full bathrooms, a family room & living room - both with large TVs, laundry area, and large kitchen. The nook off of the kitchen is great for catching a sunrise while having coffee. If the weather permits, the deck areas are all spacious and provide an outstanding view of the lake. The kitchen is also equipped with everything you need for preparing and serving meals. The neighborhood is small and quiet, and very close to the boat ramp, for easy access to the lake. The house is also conveniently located about 15 mins from Pittsburg, Daingerfield, and Mount Pleasant -- providing access to several local restaurants, shopping, and site-seeing. We loved the experience at the Lake House!"

Stayed with kids","The house is very nice with a great layout! We met up with out of state family here for a mid-point getaway weekend and had a variety of ages of kids from toddlers to teen. The sunroom & decks were perfect with so many different areas to hang out. The lake front was gorgeous and the kids were able to walk along the shore edge to throw rocks and play in the water. The property is very private!!
There’s a nice fire pit area with plenty of firewood which we enjoyed s’mores & a relaxing bonfire.
The sunrise view is gorgeous to have coffee and relax on your option of spaces to relax. Inside the house looks newly remodeled but not too over done. Very spacious with a lot more amenities than most we’ve stayed in. Great master shower!
This is a longer review than I’ve done in the past and this property deserves it. Owners communicate perfectly and we certainly plan to keep this one on our list of favorites! LOVED IT!"

It’s worth asking Scott for alternative directions to the lake, the roads are a little rough but the second route isn’t as bad as the way GPS wants to take you. Scott is very responsive and will go above and beyond to make sure your stay is perfect. While you’re there, make sure you read his book!"

The roads to get to the house are some of the worst I've ever driven on. Once we found an alternate route, it made it a little easier. We would absolutely book with Scott again if we find ourselves back in the area! Thank you, Scott, for a wonderful stay!"

Stayed one night","We had high hopes for our stay, and although there was nothing catastrophic, it fell a little short. There was a delay for us us being able to use the hot tub, several things in the house were broken, and there were some issues with cleanliness. The host was responsive and worked with us to make everything right, and for that we were grateful . Below are some of our pros and cons so you can see if this property is the right fit for your needs.
Pros: good communication with host, well-appointed kitchen with a nice coffee bar, cute furnishings/decoration, beautiful view of the lake, wonderful boat house, nice folding outdoor chairs for use, comfy reclining sofas, good TVs
Cons: very rough roads to get to the house, a bit of a rough neighborhood, spring coil mattresses, have to walk through the primary bedroom to get to screened porch/hot tub, very thin walls so you can hear everything throughout the house (since this is a mobile home), only seating for 2 at the drop side ""dining table"""

Stayed a few nights","Great home. Looks exactly as described. The owners, Scott and Nikki were very responsive and helpful. The hot tub was ideal looking straight on the lake. The kitchen was well equipped. The beds were very comfortable. The AC worked like a champ.
We had some minor issues, and the owners were quick to address them.
My only two concerns:
1) not a fan of there being a security camera right above the hot tub. That said, they were quick to say we’re welcome to cover it up with a towel. I was told its purpose was to watch the lake for trespassers.
2) Also, their neighborhood is nice with some nice homes and a very welcoming and communicative neighborhood cat. We felt completely safe. However, we had to drive through a sketchy neighborhood of dirt roads that almost required 4-wheel drive to get to their place. It was fine and the folks were friendly. We quickly entered their neighborhood and all was great.
All in all, a great trip and I’ll definitely go back."

It rained most of our stay so we didn’t get to enjoy much of the outdoor space but from our time spent exploring it seemed that the outdoor deck was not quite as well cared for, as the inside of the house, but it was still usable and offered beautiful views of the pond. I would highly recommend a stay here if you are looking for a weekend away from it all."

We were able to have family come down and spend the weekend with us, and we haven’t seen them in over a 2 years! We got to fish, swim, play games, grill, and roast marshmallows. Also, when it was time to sleep, it felt like sleeping on clouds and no one wanted to get out of bed the next morning. Skip was such an amazing host and very friendly! Communicating with him was very simple and he made sure we were all enjoying our stay. Although the trip felt like it went by too fast, we know exactly where we will be going again next trip! I believe we plan to come back by the fall season. Thank you, Skip, for opening up your home and making it comfortable for your guests!"

Super clean, cozy, and modern. Gated and private so our new car was always safe. I only regret we did not get to spend more time at the little cabin. There were picnic tables, a grill, and a fire pit with lights all around. The caretakers literally thought of everything! Four people could stay there comfortably. We will stay there again one day!

I might advise a family with 2 full sized teenagers that can’t share beds to get the bigger place on the premises as a full grown teenager may not fit well on the loft couch or living room couch. We loved our stay and would rent again.

There are 2 decks on opposite ends of the house. Both provide 100% serenity and are screened. Tall pines surround you and leave you shaded and feeling peaceful.
The house is a little over a mile away from The Cove and Overlook park, where you can immediately access the mouth opening beauty of Lake Cypress Springs. M&J were helpful for providing a guide of things to do in a folder. The house is stocked well with necessary appliances and tools to make your stay a breeze and convenient, just like home.
The outside space is ready for grilling and Texas summer fires in the pit.
You will be honored to stay with M&J."

Stayed a few nights","The place is great. It’s peaceful and is well managed. I loved the loft that has a big bed. Such a small and wonderful place to stay.
Things I like:
1. Two big beds
2. Propane grill outside.
3. Private gated place, peaceful
4. Lot of trees in the backyard
5. Lot of utensils to use.
6. Modern decorations
7. CALM and Relaxing
Things that can be improved:
1. Can provide firewood (to buy). It’s such a nice place to get fire going outside.
2. Recliners instead of sofa by the TV.
Overall a great place to stay."

Stayed one night","I wish we could have stayed more than just one night! Peaceful little tiny home in the woods near a lake. Even though it was in the woods, it was still very clean.
One thing is when using the address to get there, copy and paste the address from Airbnb, do not let the Airbnb app or website take you to your maps. If you do it from the website, it’ll take you to the town center, if you copy and paste, it’ll take you directly to the property."

Stayed a few nights","Father and Son Trip:
My son and I were looking for something close to a lake with privacy and room to hangout. We hit the jackpot with this place.
This was a best in class experience and raises the bar for tiny homes. We were living in luxury with the most comfortable beds and amenities.
Perfectly located! We were just a very short (2 minute) drive down the street from a great fishing spot, the cove restaurant with ice cream and a full bar and cypress lake.
This place could sleep a family of 3-4 with small kids.
My wife and daughters would love this place! All the best parts of the outdoors with the comforts of home (plumbing, internet, and a comfy couch for movie night) just inside.
On this trip we enjoyed: Grilling, Campfires, Corn Hole, Exploring the state park, playing catch, fishing, going to The Cove for lunch, we rented a boat! (Top Water Boat Rental $450) and Netflix at night. The internet was also great for getting a little work done.
Highly recommend!"

I had never stayed in a tiny house, but this was a great, efficient space with everything I needed. I was reading one day and movement beyond the big plate-glass windows caught my attention. A young buck was strolling right past the window!
M&J's attention to detail was great. The decor, the cleanliness, the setting, the aggregate stone at the parking area, the cafe lights surrounding a firepit--they thought of everything.
Five star setting near a beautiful lake--can't beat it!"

I love to cook so was thrilled to find a fully stocked kitchen with spices so that we could enjoy some fab meals each day! The view from the loft was amazing, and I loved having my morning coffee on the screened front porch enjoying the view. In short, you MUST stay here!

The driveway off the main road was clearly marked and even lit up at night. There are security features throughout the property including a gated entrance along with cameras. The tiny house was beautifully decorated and thoughtfully stocked. Everything was clearly marked with labels from the drawers to the light switches to make the stay simple and easy. This house and property is loaded with extra features including a bug repellent misting system which worked great. If you are looking for a getaway to the piney woods of east texas we could not recommend this place more. 5 stars and 2 thumbs up!"

We also really enjoyed the stunning lake view from the master bedroom and the kitchen. It made standing in the kitchen and cooking so pleasant. The kitchen had everything that we needed which made meal times easy. The inline gas grill was amazing for cooking dinner every night.
We would give this place a 10 star rating if possible. We will be staying here again in the future. It’s so nice to be able to stay somewhere that you don’t need to bring anything with to enjoy. The state park in driving range gave us plenty to do while we weren’t there enjoying the cabin.
Thank you so much for creating this space and sharing with the rest of us!"

Stayed with kids","Title: Spacious 60s Home in Quiet Area
Review: Having stayed in many Airbnb's, I offer a comparative perspective. The house is spacious, well-located (to dining and shopping) and features a kid-friendly sunroom with games. However, more blankets and pillows are needed for added comfort and the worn linens should be updated. Essential amenities like an iron, hair dryer, and starter supplies (coffee, shampoo, individual soap) are lacking. These amenities, commonly found in hotels, should be provided in an Airbnb. Visible WiFi information would improve accessibility. The absence of smoke detectors in each bedroom is concerning. In conclusion, the house itself evoked a sense of nostalgia akin to staying in my grandmothers 1960s home, albeit with some updates in the past. The house offers considerable space and a peaceful atmosphere, attention to the aforementioned details could elevate the experience. I would stay here again overall just better aware how to prepare next time."

Stayed with kids","I cannot say enough about the host, Janear! She was amazing! She had notified us before our stay about an issue with the A/C. With temperatures in the 100’s, she left it up to us to cancel or keep our reservation. We chose to cancel. Then, we did find accommodations that were less than ideal. I contacted Janear again to inquire if the problem was fixed, if we could rebook the reservation. She was so easy to communicate with and was always very quick with responses to keep us updated on how things were going. We did rebook our reservation and it was certainly worth it!
We had 7 people in the property. The rooms were clean, organized, and spacious. We never felt like we were on top of each other. We all had plenty of room to spread out.
The pool was a huge hit with all of us, especially with the temperature. The outdoor space around the pool was perfect. Calm, quiet, and relaxing. The basketball game was a huge hit with the grandkids too. We will definitely book this same property!"

Stayed a few nights","The house itself was safe and tidy.
Keep in mind, only the bare minimum is provided at the Airbnb.
One towel per guest for the entire duration. You can request extra towels in advance for using the pool, however, it comes at a price for $15. There was no shampoo, conditioner etc. only body wash. The pool was a nice amenity, however we had to clean up leaves and bugs prior to us using it.
Also note, the listing states that there are no cameras on the property. We noted a ring camera at the front door, and one in the backyard facing the pool. We also saw an ADT camera on the outside of the master bedroom door though we aren’t certain if that was connected or not.
Overall it was a good stay and we felt safe."

Stayed a few nights","Janear's place was a great stop at the end of our trip. We found the property even more spacious than it appears in the photos. The neighborhood was quiet and peaceful and a short drive to the local stores and restaurants. We really enjoyed the pool. One thing to note, we didn't notice that Janear will provide additional towels for the pool only if requested in advance of the stay (she does state this clearly in the listing). We found it challenging having one towel per person for the duration of our stay so if you intend to use the pool, be sure to request in advance :)"

The pool in the backyard was an incredible treat and enjoyed by everyone!! And the host was very fast to respond to all the questions I had before we arrived, to include a lovely lunch recommendation in Mt. Pleasant. Very reasonably priced and so thankful we found this treasure of a house! Will definitely be staying here again in the future!!"

Stayed one night","I am a local that was affected by a major power outage in our area & I was looking for a place to stay with my kids. Crystal was extremely accomplished & communicative, she even offered a room at the venue on property to stay in while we waited for the cabin to be cleaned due to the lack of AC in our area. Summers in Texas are extremely hot so that was a very nice gesture. We ended up not needing the extra room since Crystal let me know as soon as the cabin was clean & allowed us to check in early. This location is beautiful, peaceful & well worth the price! I hope to return in the future."

The cabin was super cute, clean, peaceful, and fun to be at. It was nice to wake up to the views, and horses/1 donkey. There were large white dogs, they were so gentle and kind. This place helped recharge my battery, and prepare mentally/emotionally for the funeral. Thank you for being an amazing host! 💕"

It was very clean with rustic decor that was perfect for the setting. Crystal was easy to get in touch with and left us a kind note saying they were sorry for our loss. The cabin was plenty big for the two of us and was nicely stocked with things we needed. I would definitely stay there again if I was in the area!

Well yes it’s remote but behind a huge electronic gate with the family right next door and set back off the road so I felt perfectly safe and it’s so peaceful ! It is clean and cozy and has everything you need . I loved being close to the horses grazing and the trails you can walk around the property on. One last comment : the rain shower is a really nice touch ! The hosts are wonderful too.

Sat on the dock or around the fire pit and enjoyed the outdoors.
Bring a fishing pole. The largemouth bass and sand bass seem to starting biting right off the dock close to sundown.

Group trip","The pictures provided in the listing are accurate. The house is spacious yet cozy, and the glass garage door in the living area provides a beautiful view of the lake. The house and grounds appeared to be well maintained. Our group fished at the lake house and caught quite a few keeper catfish and crappie. The only issues we had were small issues. The hot water in both showers would get extremely hot then cold regardless of how the temperature adjustment was placed. The coffee maker in the kitchen had old molded coffee grounds still inside. I would recommend bringing your own coffee maker. Other than these small issues this location is worth renting for a serene and relaxing stay."

Stayed with a pet","Amazing property. Great neighborhood. Neighbors very friendly. Great place to relax and do nothing but float. Nice furnishings and amenities. Beds we’re comfortable. We spent 7 glorious days just hanging in the boat house and floating on the lake.
Mornings were so peaceful, sitting on the dock meditating and watching the fish jump and the turtles poking their heads up for a breath of air. It was too warm so we couldn’t take advantage of the fire pit, but I bet it’s great sitting out there at with a fire.
The property feels like you are in the country but only about 6 miles from town so it’s quick to just go grab something. Everything you need can be found in Mt. Pleasant.
The only thing to remember is you are on a lake, there are critters that make it their home. We did have to do a spider web clearing every day on the boat house, but we grew up on a lake and expected that. It comes with being in nature.
Highly recommend if you are looking for a relaxing escape."

We enjoyed playing games at the kitchen table and fishing from the pier although the weather was too cool and windy to catch any fish. The only recommendation our family had was to possibly consider a more comfortable place of seating in the living room area to relax and watch a movie or just lounge and chill. There was a more comfortable couch upstairs but not everyone in our family is able to climb stairs. Other than that everything was great.

The town's people were so friendly, like literally every where we went someone said hi with a smile. I think it was so obvious we were from somewhere else lol.  Loved it and will visit again. I highly recommend this place,  and I give it 1000 stars 😁. Thanks Brian!!!"

Stayed a few nights","This was our second visit to this home. It was my birthday weekend. We caught a lot of fish in just a few hours. Boaters also stopped and gave us large crappy. We were catching catfish and crappy. It stormed two days straight during our 4 day stay but it was beautiful watching the rain over the lake and the wet greenery. Very calm area. Walmart and restaurants are not too far. We went to our favorite bait store that we visited last year. Kountry Korner is the bait store. Maybe 15 miles away from the rental. To get there you have to cross another lake where lots of people are off to the side of the bridge fishing. The only issues was spotty wifi but it's expected amongst large trees. I could go on. Try this place out. The open windows in the living and dining areas overlooking the lake is a plus. We have a travel 32"" TV and firestick that we take on our trips to use in the bedrooms of lake houses. Hint hint for those who travel alot. Great second stay and great fishing again. Clean."

Stayed a few nights","My friends and I were in Mt. Pleasant for our 30 year class reunion from MPHS. Three of us stayed comfortably at their 3/2 home. Beautiful location on Lake Tankersley did not disappoint at all. We were even able to take morning dips in the lake off of the dock - exercise caution getting in and out. The back patio made a great setting for our evening BBQs using the grill and morning breakfasts on the covered back patio table. Although a little weathered, the outdoor picnic table was also a great option.
The house was VERY WELL furnished and supplied - kitchen needs (even zip lock bags, spices and sauces, bagged ice, sugar, hot tea and Kurig coffee pods - some items which we did replace before leaving :-) Plenty of towels, soap and shampoo, etc. The temperature control options (A/C and fans) , water temp and pressure was great.
MP does have Uber and Lyft services; I would not rely on being able to access them during your stay. EXCELLENT property; worth the value for sure."

We went to Walmart twice. Also to find live bait we went to Kountry Korner. They have groceries and cooked mexican food and pizza for fishing snacks at the store. Many places to shop at in the area. We had a few service issues the last full day but they were minor and out of their control. I recommend this place. We saw boats passing having fun with the kids on the back being pulled and a man fishing from his boat one morning and a family of 3 on jet skis for the holiday. Not too busy of a lake otherwise. Peace and quiet.

From the charming and cozy furnishings to the serene lake view from the kitchen and living room, we felt so relaxed and peaceful during our week long stay. Some highlights include the wonderful fireplace (we made a fire every day) and a fully stocked kitchen that enabled us to cook a lovely Thanksgiving meal. Roseanne also left some foil roasting pans for us which was very thoughtful and came in very handy. The king size bed and bedding was very comfortable; they also provided soap, shampoo and conditioner in both bathrooms. It's just a short drive into town or to the supermarket, so we had no issues making multiple trips to get more firewood or an ingredient for our holiday meal. Roseanne was a wonderful host and immediately responded to some questions we had - we would definitely stay here again!"
