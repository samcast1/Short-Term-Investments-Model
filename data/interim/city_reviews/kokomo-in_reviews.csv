Stayed a few nights","The house was what we needed for the weekend. We needed the refrigerator to hold our food we took to the race and those staying behind and the washer and dryer were nice.
We didn't see that towels were not provided so we needed to go buy some. They were provided at the other places that we stayed. Was a good place and location for us for the weekend."

Stayed a few nights","Couldn't find the towels and I'm finding them in a closet with no handle that was closed. Then the heat went out for 2 days. He was very proactive on it Was not conveniesafe. Side door has a little handle. Lock front door has a dead bolt. Side door should also have one I think. It was a big place but is run down from the pictures.If you compare them I made it work. I only had a couple of days before. I went back home before I have to come back to work. But once again, the place is big and needs some updates and this place would be one of the best place to stay for guys working intown I would come back after the little this got done ..thanks for having me joe"

Stayed a few nights","Probably one of the nicest houses in the neighborhood. Host is very helpful and gave easy and clear instructions for check-in and very receptive to feedback. House was very clean and looks as advertised. Beds were comfortable and the blankets and linens were clean. Plenty of towels and the washer/dryer works so you can do a cycle if you use a lot of towels. TV works great and has all the different apps built in. WiFi is reliable and fast. Water pressure is great, but if you’re from places outside of the state, I recommend using bottled water for drinking and coffee.
In three words: clean, convenient, roomy. Would definitely book this place again."

Stayed a few nights","I think the photos don’t do the place justice - much cuter in real life! This was the perfect place for our stay. There is a side door next to the driveway that was helpful to us getting my disabled sister in the house. The handicap rails in the shower were also useful as my sister has balance issues (she uses a walker).
The neighborhood is quiet and the beds are comfortable. We had a great stay and I’d stay here again if I find myself back in the area."

Will stay there again!!! Very comfortable! Once you pull in the driveway and go through the front door, you can open the kitchen door and you are in the driveway which made unloading the car easy!! Also loading the car to leave was so convenient. My 86 year old father-in-law was even able to help."

Stayed with kids","For the most part the home was as described, everything on the listing was provided and looked like the picture. Mearl did a good job with responding, and he allowed us to check in before 3pm. That was great because we had a red eye flight to Indiana and we were exhausted. Unfortunately there was an issue with the space being clean and there were a lot of ants. Took 1 1/2 hour to clean.
Pros
*Easy Check-in
*Good communication ( We contacted him for any spray it was provided promptly)
*Received $30 back for cleaning( should have been a full refund)
*Good size home for, four people
*Driveway parking space( worked out great during the snow)
*Laundry room
* Work space
*Quite neighborhood ( It’s winter so there wasn’t traffic)
*Good location
Cons
The home was not cleaned properly.
*Bathroom tub and took dirty.Ants all over floor
* Stove food stains on top and in oven. Oven caked on stains
* Uncleaned Bedding (dry wht fluid)
* Washer had mold
* Smoke odor
* No heat in living room"

Group trip","Location was lovely and was perfect for our group to have space to play yard games, relax and cook meals together. We found some great restaurants downtown to eat and parks to go on nice walks. We were surprised by it being listed as a 4 bedroom house, but the 4th bedroom was a tiny den and we had to search for a while for an air mattress and sheets, which the host had to drop off to us later that evening. There was plenty of space for the 8 adults we booked in the house, but the bedroom situation put a damper on the weekend. it would make for a great place to stay if it's a large family and kids can take the air mattress."

Everything was accurate and Rebekah answered me very quickly on the app. The neighborhood is a safe and quiet place as well, I left my bike and car-top carrier on my car all night and it was still untouched the following day. I would definitely stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","I loved this AirBnB. It's just as pictured: the outside looks like a dollhouse, but the interior has nice, high ceilings (so the space didn't feel at all cramped). It is on a surprisingly quiet residential road just off the highway, extremely convenient for my road trip. I stayed here in May and used the AC, but there's a lovely electric fireplace, so I'm sure it would be cozy in winter, too. Has a small fridge and microwave, which was convenient. Totally clean, nice linens and decor. It sits on a private, green lawn, so keeping the shades open made for a nice view. It could work for a couple; as a single traveler, I would definitely recommend this stay as it felt safe, and the hosts were really responsive, and you can tell the Carter family cares about this tiny house. I'm relieved to have found a place to stay within driving distance of my own family. Highly recommend."

This was a great adventure for an overnight stay. Easy to find, very quiet and a comfortable rest. We have stayed at tiny (and unique) homes, and this is in our top ten.
We were going to the Cristkindlmrkt on our way back from Indy but the rain had a change of plans. From the guest book comments we went back to Kokomo and the Treasure Mart Antique Mall. What a blast!
Highly recommend Rosann's place if you want to have fun!"

The toilet definitely takes some getting used to when you're used to a regular one, but overall it was perfect for the 2 nights we were in town for a family reunion. Roseann is super friendly helpful! Only thing I would recommend is another step up into the house as it was kinda steep for someone that may have knee or hip issues like I do. Thanks so much for offering this Tiny Home to rent! Can't wait to see the other one when you're finished 🥰"

Stayed a few nights","You’d be surprise how much space there was actually! We were greeted up arrival. Basically we stayed for a place to sleep. The bed was super comfortable! If you want close to Kokomo but not downtown this is a great little place. Our only complaint was that it was an hour and a half from the reason we were in IN, and that’s not on you, that’s on me. If we could have picked this place up and moved it closer that would have been ideal! The dry toilet kinda freaked us both out, but again that’s on us, not you. The shower worked great! We’d stay again if we ever had to go to Kokomo."

Stayed a few nights","The tiny house was so cute and clean. I appreciated all of the thoughtful touches within it, as well as the book of instructions and things to do in the area. It definitely helped us as first time tiny housers and first timers to Kokomo! The location of the house was also great - we got around Kokomo during our stay, no problem, with everything in our itinerary being less than 15 minutes away. It was very homey for such a small space. There were 6 or 7 ducks to watch at the duck pond out front, as well as a few geese with babies. It is a peaceful place! I do wish I would have known that the house had a bit of a construction site out back - I moreso thought there would be green space in front and back of it, rather than just in front. A fence extended from the sides of the tiny house, blocking off a large area behind it. It wasn't noisy or anything while we were there, just not quite as open or secluded as expected. Hopefully they are just adding more cool features to the property for the future! Overall, we had a great time! A cute, clean space for a getaway!"

I loved the snacks and bottled water she left. I enjoyed having my coffee with the view of the pond and ducks. Roseanne was responsive and answered all of my questions. When I learned I needed to stay in town an extra day she did all she could to accommodate. I really appreciated that. I’m sure I will ask to stay at Roseannes again."

Apart from the wonderful cottage, the only negative is that on several nights over the week, the neighbors across the alleyway had vehicles coming and going at all hours of the night well into the early morning, accompanied by loud conversations, idling vehicles, and bumping audio. Made for a couple of restless nights. I know this is outside of the host's control, but it's something you should be aware of.
Regardless, I'd still stay here again, as the location is perfect for a central Kokomo location!"

David is a great host, there if you need anything, but, not intrusive.
We had almost everything we needed... there are no kitchen utensils which meant we had to eat out all the time (not necessarily a downside). David provides some necessary food items upon arrival which was very much appreciated.
The cottage was clean, clutter free and very comfortable with easy to work heating (we were there in November). Coming from a different country this was a relief.
I would highly recommend staying at The Garden Cottage."

I enjoyed a clean, bright and VERY comfortable one-bedroom home with some simple but elegant touches that made the place feel like a home away from home, except with nicer sheets and towels! The proximity right next to the English Rose Cafe & Tea Room was an added bonus. I bought a delicious breakfast quiche the next morning, which came with a nice salad with a delicious raspberry vinaigrette. We will make it our ambition to return."

Negatives: The room has a terrible cigarette smoke odor, that needs to be addressed. The bathroom needs a good cleaning and there was a molded coffee filter inside the coffee pot.

Stayed one night",It was a quick stay but felt right at home. The bed was clean and comfortable. I slept like baby which was great because I had to get up early for work. Kevin was wonderful. He greeted me and showed me around and then left me to my privacy. I would definitely stay here again. Thank you!

Stayed a few nights","I wish I could give it more than five stars. But to anyone reading this, I have two pieces of advice
a) Check the listing's address/location in the aerial view to get a better idea of the location
b) Follow the instructions mentioned after booking the place
Kevin and his wife were more than accommodating and lovely. They have a lovely dog Hazel who's so extremely friendly and energetic and makes you feel very loved. This place is the perfect stay if you are in the city for a short visit and just need a place to crash overnight. I stayed here when I was new in the area and waiting for my apartment to get ready for check-in.
I would highly recommend it and I am sure you will have a great time staying at this listing."

Stayed a few nights","Loved the peace and quiet at Kevin’s house! Very cozy and comfortable space. Kevin met me when I got there to show me around and make sure I felt comfortable! The bathroom had some toiletries that I had forgotten, I was grateful for that! The coffee bar was a great plus and they had freshly baked goods for me in the morning! The door didn’t have a lock on it, which wasn’t something I looked for in the amenities listed but I wasn’t bothered by it at all. If I’m back in Kokomo I will definitely check to see if Kevin has availability!"

The space is just as described and pictured. It is private, and the setting is beautiful. I had a good night's sleep in the comfortable bed, and enjoyed my freshly made morning cup of coffee.

The amenities alone are worth the stay, with the gorgeous pool area & hot tub, outside mini fridges & tiki bar, grill, smoker, covered patio area & bonfire set up that was perfect for our getaway. There is a zip line, slides & swings that the kids were obsessed with. There was a Frisbee golf course & beautiful trails to walk around with plenty of privacy on the property. The fur babies are well-behaved & were a highlight for our family. They were great with the kids & got so much love.The only complaint was not having more time to stay & enjoy paradise here! Kim & Terry were by far the best hosts I've met thru airbnb. They went above & beyond for our family. We were provided with thoughtful surprises for the kids & they helped transport great grandpa to & from the pool area. They are truly the type of people you want to be around & we can't wait to come back! Thankyou so much Kim & Terry <3 :)"

Group trip","My husband and I took 4 of our teenage grandkids to Kokomo to visit our other grandkids. We stayed at Boyds Place for 3 nights. It was perfect. Very homey, and had everything we needed. Plenty of room for everyone to set and relax, and sleep. Nice quiet neighborhood. I enjoyed setting on the front porch with my coffee. The kids all had enough room to sit in the bedrooms and have long conversations well into the night, while Mamaw & Papaw sacked out in the living room. To say this was the perfect spot for the family is an understatement. Very easy check in also.
We will be returning. My husband and I will be planning our trips to visit our son and family by the available dates of this house."

It is in town...so there was some street noise (especially to us country people) but it wasn’t too bad and never disturbed our sleep- even the baby.

Stayed with kids","This Place was merely a house to rest your head at night and nothing more. The listing stated there were two twins and two queen beds. However, one of beds was a full size bed. The house floors were dirty, seemed as if they hadn’t been swept in months. There was a dog toy under one of the wicker couches, which supports the statement of the place not being swept. The shower was disgusting, full of mold and mildew. The floor lamps was fire hazards and unstable, with broken lamp shades. The front door looked like it had been kicked in at one point and repainted, with a broken storm door.
In the kitchen you could see the exposed edges of drywall where it hadn’t been painted or taped, merely screwed into the wall. The noise level of the neighborhood was extreme, as well as continuous police sirens. There were cigarette butts all over the ground outside the door, and the place reeked of filth.
Overall, the place felt like somewhere you would never want to pay to stay. But, if you need shelter instead of a car, this would be the next best option. We would never recommend this location to anyone."

Stayed a few nights","Don't mistake all ""five star"" evaluations as false because they're all five out of five--I call 'em like I see 'em.
Jane provides ancillary information as needed--and, as a plus, the bed is especially comfortable
Her house is everything she said it was, and the neighborhood is all she portends it to be. Jane is affable and amiable, and the dollar value for the stay is superb.
What struck me most; however, was the lighting. It was exceptional--by far the best lighting I've experienced in the last five Airbnbs I've stayed at.
If you're looking for a quiet and affordable place to stay while you're in the Kokomo, Indiana area, secure your reservation now--before another does: You'll be glad you did."

Stayed a few nights","Janie's place was great! The kitchen had everything we needed to cook (AND a toaster, which was fantastic because we had an abnormal craving for toast!), the little house was spacious for 3 people & the neighborhood was lovely, quiet & safe. The little patio outside is a nice shaded place to sit, & it was awesome to have off-street parking!
Janie was as nice as can be; she stayed up way too late to greet us & let us in, several hours past our initial ETA. She's super responsive & was always reassuring when I messaged to let her know we'd be late (again). We appreciated her kindness & willingness to be flexible.
The only issue for us was the bed: far too squishy; there was no way for us to get comfortable because there was no way to really lie flat. People who love a soft bed might love this, but it was agony for me and i ended up sleeping on the floor instead.
I'd go back to stay with Janie anytime I'm in the area, especially if she can get a firm mattress in there. :))"

I came to Kokomo to visit family close to holidays and decided to book an air bnb to have my own space to relax in. I was very pleasantly surprised by this lovely space and the occomodating host! She even brought cake pans so i could bake my daughter a birthday cake. The stackable washer and dryer were great to have available. this home is very well supplied with things you might need and is located in a very safe quiet part of town with easy access to all things. i would have stayed longer had it not been booked. I will be back next week and plan to return to Kokomo in August and hope to book it for lodging again if available. I highly recommend this cute little place! I loved it!

We liked the location--in is in a quiet residential area but a very easy drive to grocery stores and gas stations and such. Do note that there isn't central air if you are traveling in the summer, but fans and wall unit do cool it enough to sleep well even in late July. All in all, the place is well maintained and as-advertised. Janie is very helpful and responsive."

Stayed a few nights","From the moment we booked, to the final good bye at the end of our glorious stay, Janie made it all SUPERB!! She offered to help us find all, the place, access,,open the doors as we arrived so much later,,(middle of night actually ) than anticipated. Janie assured our stay be positive and comfortable, even having stocked kitchen goods, laundry soap, toiletry items, ceiling fans turned on,,and so much more. Words fail to convey the comfort,,kindness, peace,,and welcome we felt the entire time.
That, plus, the area, the people,,the landscape, all so peaceful and calm (not to mention the house is insulated so well-total silence during the night). We loved it so much, exploring the neighborhood ,,Heritage Park was out of this realm , in beauty, and again, everyone,,including wildlife , so so kind and welcoming, the departure was sad, it was so good. We will return, if Janie will have us, and will get to know more of the lovely area of Kokomo, Indiana.
A place to call home!!!(even if only away from home) THANK YOU"

Stayed with kids","The host is phenomenal! She is available and answered all of our questions. I am disabled and we know some places say they are accessible but they really aren't. This place is more accessible than it appears to be. There is a sidewalk path that goes straight onto the porch without needing to use any steps. There is also an actual handicap bar too hold onto on one of the posts while stepping up. Inside is easy to get around. The shower does have a small lip but has a built in seat and removable shower head with a magnetic strip that makes it adjustable height. The host turned the bed and moved other things in the room, realizing I would need more room on the side to be able to get in with the walker or wheelchair. She did this without us even realizing that might be a need. I absolutely recommend this place to anyone. To the disabled crew, definitely better than any accessible hotel room and better than any accessible place to stay I've ever been to."

Stayed a few nights","The home is an older ranch with new furnishings and redecorated very nice. The kitchen and bathrooms were original, however, in very good condition. Shower head low in bath/tub, but 6’4” managed ok. A small shower, toilet sink off the mud room, was very functional and used by our party. Always nice to have 2 bathrooms for 4 people. As advertised, the house is on an organic farm and the setting is very peaceful. You can watch sunrises and sunsets across the fields. There is a nice sunroom off the mud room, and it was a nice spot to sit quietly with coffee and also conversations. I would highly recommend this cottage and host."
