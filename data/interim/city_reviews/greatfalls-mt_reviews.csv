Stayed a few nights","I loved my stay at Troy's place. It was perfect for my business trip and I appreciated a well-stocked kitchen, easy parking, and such a clean space. The heated floor in the bathroom was a nice touch as well as the air purifier and the heat/AC. Next time I'm in GF, I'll plan to stay here again!!"

Stayed a few nights","Troy’s place was wonderful. It is perfect for a couple, plenty of space and all of the necessary amenities provided. The apartment was very clean and tidy and it was clear that Troy takes a lot of pride in providing a great place for people to stay. There was always ample parking right out the front and check in was very easy. The full kitchen is a great addition and there was plenty of cutlery and cooking utensils. The place is located within walking distance from parks and town. Thank you for the stay!"

Loved the heated bathroom flooring since it was cold out when we were there. Comfortable and had everything we needed. Stayed once last year and if it is available next year when we come we will stay again. Bed was comfortable."

Great Falls itself was a bit of a let down, (the falls have a hydro dam, a lot of the antique shops were closed...). The location is close to train tracks, so it may not be the best place if you are a light sleeper. Otherwise, I highly recommend this spot. A+!"

Stayed with a pet","Beautiful and cozy place. A lot of amenities for a small studio. Have a cot for people that may need it. Keep in mind you'll have to wash your dishes which wasn't a problem at all for me but Troy did mention it in the rules prior and also I believe there is not a cleaning fee or it is really small if there is one. Perfect distance to the downtown areas without being in the center of commotion. There is an awesome induction stove but not an oven which you can see from Troy's photos. Worked wonderfully for my family and myself. Simple instructions. Comfortable bed and the tv/speaker system Is awesome for watching action packed movies. The bathroom is very spacious for a studio, wasn't expecting that and it was lovely. Great water pressure but since it is chilly give the hot water a second to run if you like really hot showers. Smelled marvelous when we walked in. The a/c and heater worked great. Everything was very clean. 10/10"

Stayed with a pet",Communication with Troy was simple and expedient. The rental is nicely designed. The days we visited were hot and Troy had the air conditioner on for us before arriving so we entered pleasantly. We came and went the same way and were pleased that we didn’t have to fool around with the settings for indoor temperature control! Instructions were simple also- clean dishes before checking out. The bed was uncomfortable and I tweaked it before the second night. Hopefully it will be better for your stay. It was hard and had a moisture barrier cover only under the sheet between that and the mattress. The lower north side where the rental exists can be questionable but we felt safe and fine. Traveling to and from the rental around town was again - simple.

Do not worry, we never saw them and they didn’t “bother” us at all. It was just like any other hotel stay, very private. This is the only place I’ll stay when visiting Great Falls!"

Stayed a few nights","We absolutely loved Nicole’s place. My friends and I travelled to shop and hang out before returning to work. We had so much space to cook, visit and spend time outside. The house is in such a beautiful neighborhood and it was spotless. Nicole had a thoughtful welcome basket for us and there was all the information we needed for everything in the house.
We could tell what a well loved space it was/is for Nicole and her family and we are already talking about an annual or semi annual visit to her home.
I can’t think of anything missed or any way our stay could have been improved - everything was perfect!!"

One note if you’re staying during the summer - there are only 2 window units in the bedrooms so the living room/kitchen/dining area was very hot. It was over 80 degrees inside when we got there and took about 12 hours to get down to a more comfortable temperature. Would be a nonissue any other time if the year.

The house is very clean and uncluttered. Everything you need is provided and the amenities are excellent. The deep tub and pool table are awesome to have available. The washer and dryer make long stays so much more convenient. It’s well cared for, open, and spacious.
There’s a great wrap around deck with seating, so you can enjoy the great weather and privacy the landscaping offers. The neighbor is quiet with plenty of parking. It’s close to restaurants, retail shops, and grocery stores.

The house was clean and well stocked, and the pool table, jetted tub and sauna were nice unique things to do. We ended up only leaving to go to the airshow we came for, and spent the rest of the time just doing various things at the house! This place also has a deck with a bbq and table to eat outside, as well as a nice front yard. It’s a great bird watching house as well since the windows are large and the trees in the front yard are beautiful and seem to attract wildlife. It was hot this weekend, so having the air conditioner in one of the bedrooms was a life saver! Full laundry washer/dryer access was very nice as well. Looking forward to another stay in the future!"

But no the farthest we went was the gates of the mountains for the day, we stayed in great falls in heathers house for 75% of the trip housed 5 nights of barbecues for my mom and dad who live half the year in great falls. Very comfortable place to stay with people you love. Great falls hands down will be the only place I stay in Montana now.
Heathers house I will stay in again it’s very clean pool table was really fun the bath was so good and the sofas wow!

Stayed one night","Fabulous accommodation right in the heart of downtown Great Falls! The apartment has more of an upscale condo feel, yet retains the novelty of the historic building & surroundings. Everything was as represented and described, and the charm of the space exceeded expectations. The stairs are not for the faint-of-heart yet consistent with any multi-level complex, so just be aware if you have mobility challenges. The location is great, especially if you are focused on activities around the downtown area, however, nothing is very far in GF! I was delighted overall with my stay and would highly recommend it to others:)"

The location was perfect as I could walk almost everywhere I needed to go during my trip and there a bunch of good restaurants, coffeeshops and bars nearby. The space itself was clean and exactly as presented with no gotchas or bummers. Nice and quiet, and very clean, I'd gladly stay there again. Nicole was also a fantastic communicator and while no problems arose during the trip, I'm pretty confident she would have helped resolve them immediately if something did come up."

Our stay was good — warm & comfy. We stayed in December during the extreme frigid weather (-22°) so a warm condo was of utmost importance.
The condo was well stocked with the necessities. When needed, Nicole was easily accessible & promptly responded.
Having a washer & dryer inside the unit was a nice plus.
For some, a drawback would be the stairs to the third floor. We handled them ok. It was good exercise!
This was my third time staying at this condo and will definitely return. Great value for the space & convenient location.
Thank you Nicole & Steve."

Great lighting, coffee pods, all the amenities you can imagine we would love to stay again next time we visit Great Falls, MY! Beds were super comfortable as well and I loved the exposed brick/industrial ambiance. You are located right next to a bunch of amazing eateries, restaurants, and good coffee places- Al Banco has amazing espresso and is right down the straight a couple minutes walking. At night I could hear a neighboring family’s child cry and parent talk. If you turn off the window AC unit at night it does get quite warm in August month l. Stairs didn’t bother us at all and were quite easy wall up on. Having a washer dryer in the unit is the best!"

They had some of the best pastries we have ever eaten. The full size washer and dryer in the apartment were fantastic. We spent a few days camping prior to arriving at Nicole's and they were helpful to clean up our dirty clothes. The beds were soooooo comfy and cozy - very comfortable and just the right firmness. Parking in the rear of the building was easy and very secure. There are fantastic running or walking trails right along the Missouri River just a few blocks from the apartment. Tennis courts, a skate park, dog parks, and playgrounds are very close by too - all along the river. The food at Tracy's restaurant just two blocks away was great and varied - so something for everyone. Cannot say enough good things about our stay. Nicole was a great host and got back to me right away with any questions I had."

But there was white noise machine one room and and a window a/c unit in the other so it didn’t bother us. We were only awake because our baby was up for a night feeding. Close to lots of restaurants and coffee shops! Overall, great place and would stay again if we make it back to Great Falls."

Stayed with kids","Nice older charming apartment right in downtown Great Falls. The accommodations are very spacious with two bedrooms, large closets, and a fairly large great room. Our beds were very comfortable. The kitchen was fully stocked, but there isn't a dishwasher so you need to wash your own dishes. The place was pretty quiet even though there were revelers downtown on a Saturday night. That being said, there are definitely restaurants and bars within walking distance. There is also a convenience store a few blocks away. Great value for the area."

She has updated an apartment in an old building and you are right in the center of down town Great Falls. I'm not a fan of Great Falls itself, but if you need a reasonably priced unit and don't mind climbing stairs, this is a nice choice."

I hope the owner makes it clear it's not accessible for people with physical disabilities such as difficulty walking and if the person cannot do the two steps to enter the gate area."

Stayed one night","My husband and I stayed here for only one night as we passed through on our road trip. It was exactly as it was explained- a shed with a bed. The only thing was that the AC didn’t keep the room cool, but it was 90 degrees outside. Once it cooled down a bit outside the temperature in the room was just fine. Overall, we’d stay here again!"

Stayed one night",I needed a quiet space to sleep on a business trip. I arrived at 10:30 pm after a long day of business appointments and travel and needed to be up early for another day of appointments and travel. Owner said he would turn on AC to insure room would be cool when I arrived. The room was tiny. The AC is huge and loud but the room was roasting when I arrived. It stayed hot most of the night and I couldn't sleep. I couldn't ever risk staying here again as I need good rest so I can be my best for my customers and stay safe on my travels (5000 miles a month business travel).

Jacob was a very responsive host and the value is great. After 2 weeks of tent camping we were looking forward to a good bed but unfortunately the bed was not that comfortable. I think it needs a new mattress, less creaky frame and fluffier pillows. Also a chair on the porch would be nice. I was very impressed that the little shed had plumbing and electricity and a great shower but it was a little too small for the two of us and we probably would not stay here again"

He was able to have the house cleaned and ready to go for us a night early (and on a holiday for that matter) than shown and we ended up needing to stay an extra night as well which he accommodated. He was also quick to respond to messages.
The house is just as described and so welcoming. The beds and pillows were so comfy and the beds upstairs also have an adjustable base which was a nice feature. The movie room has a built in projector which was really cool. We also enjoyed the hot tub and the kitchen has everything you need to cook and store leftovers. There is a book with recommendations for things to do, places to eat, and clear instructions,
expectations and rules for the house, none that were unreasonable by any means.
We would love to stay here again if we’re ever in the area and I highly recommend the cozy charmer."

To say this place is a cottage is humble. There is care and thought in every amenity.
The hosts, Michael and Melissa, are communicative and give clear, yet uncomplicated instructions.
From the luxurious hot tub for adults, the cute little playhouse in the backyard, the entertainment media area in the basement, to the decor…everything here invites togetherness and a great time for all.
It is obvious they’ve cared for this house and want their guests to have a wonderful experience.

Stayed with a pet","Wonderful stay in a quiet neighborhood but close to restaurants, Jaycee park and Expo Park Convention Center! Private home with many amenities including a relaxing hot tub, fenced back yard for your pups and well stocked kitchen. Our family was very comfortable and we loved having space to enjoy time together. Michael is such a great host and was responsive to all our questions! We will definitely stay here again on our next trip to Great Falls!"

Stayed with a pet","We were in town for BB tournaments. The home was a perfect location to the arena and lots of food options near by. Yard was a great size for my pups. We have older kids, However if you have young ones the yard is an ideal set up with activities to keep them busy if need be.
The home was very clean (which is the most important for me) and the beds were wonderful. Michael was helpful with all my questions and very quick to respond. ￼
I would definitely stay￼ at this location again, if I’m needing to come back to GF for a duration."

The lighting at the front needs to be brighter as it is very hard to see in the dark. No light in front entrance is needed.
After the exchange rate usd to cad and fees it was a bit disappointing for the price, as it has only one real bed, a day bed then a pullout on the floor bed both of which are quite old.
Brady was very responsive to our questions which was great."

Stayed one night","Went on a last min road-trip and found this cute house whilst driving down and reserved this place because of the hot tub that had great reviews on how clean it was (too dirty for us to go in). I told Brady we wouldn’t be there till 6ish, he replies “looking forward to hosting you! I'II send check in instructions shortly.” at 135pm. Check In on Airbnb is 3 for this place, Brady didn’t reply to my next message at 430 saying “thank you” hoping that would get him to send our check in instructions. he read it, no reply. I now am anxious because i don’t understand why he hasn’t sent it. at 535pm I asked if he had any instructions on check in for us, he reads doesn’t reply. I ask again around 605 reads no reply. We arrive and message him “we’re here” keep in mind the anxiety i had the whole drive. We notice the door was OPEN so we stand and call the hosts name nothing. I call him via the app no answer. not till 723 did we get the pin to the door of the open house. leftovers in fridge aswell"

Stayed a few nights","We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here! The house is old, but was well taken care of and nicely updated. It was also very clean. The kitchen had the basic things we needed for making our meals. Brady was great to communicate with as well. The neighborhood was quiet, although it is an old part of town. The house was really quiet which allowed us space to relax and rest. The main bedroom's bed is very soft, so that is something to be aware of. We also really enjoyed the gas fireplace in the living room. It warmed up the living room nicely and provided nice ambience. I highly recommend staying here!"

Great communication, had everything you need and more for your stay. It was as if we were walking right into our home away from home. It is an older home that has been renovated to be very modern. The floors creak when you walk to the bathroom in the middle of the night but it's the leftover character of an old renovated home. The kitchen is fully stocked with more than you think you will need. Make sure to review what's in the kitchen before going to the store you'll be surprised at what you don't need to pick up. Very quiet neighborhood, large back yard, clean hot large hot tub, fire pit with wood ready for us to us use. Beds and sheets very soft, bathroom beautiful and modern. Older home but they have A/C and furnace so not to worry if your cold you can get warm, if your warm you can get cold. We wanted two separate sleeping areas, one for the adults and one for the kid. NO snoring could be heard which kiddo felt was extremely important! Perfect hosts."

We were a family of 6 visiting the area where our son is stationed at Malmstrom Air Force Base.
If we find ourselves in Great Falls area in the future, we will look forward to staying at Molly's place again."

If I come with another big group, I would definitely book again! Two of the bedrooms are in the basement, so if you have problems with stairs, it might not work. Quirky little bathroom in basement as well but functional. Loved our stay there."

Group trip","Mollys place was perfect for our weekend in Great Falls!!
The house had plenty of beds for our group. And they were super comfy.
The living room and kitchen were spacious so we didn’t feel cramped as we gathered for food and games.
The couch was comfy for watching movies.
The house was close to everything you needed but the town is not walkable. So definitely rent a car.
The house is in a great neighborhood with sweet neighbors.
Getting in the house was a breeze with the combination lock. And Molly was great with communicating.
We will definitely be checking to see if Mollys house is available for our next girls trip to GF."

You truly feel like you are home when you stay here! It includes everything from a full kitchen (including cooking and dining ware), a full Laundry room (including detergent and dryer sheets), down to a fully stocked Kuerig and yummy treats for her guests. There is plenty of space for a large family including your fur babies! She is always just a text away, should any needs arise. I’d absolutely recommend this Airbnb to all!"

Central AC in August was so comfortable and our WiFi access was perfect. The neighborhood is great, and we enjoyed delicious breakfast treats from the Crooked Tree coffee shop nearby. Everyone in my family loved our stay. It is perfect for kids, teens, and grandparents alike. Molly was super helpful. Check-in/access throughout our stay was easy and well organized."
