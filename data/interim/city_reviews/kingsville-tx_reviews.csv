Stayed with kids","My husband and 6 year old son had a great father/son fishing trip. Carl’s place was as described and very accommodating for a typical fishing weekend. They spent a lot of time on the pier and also had a guide pick them up from the house. Overall, great trip and many wonderful memories were made!"

Stayed a few nights",This place is so awesome to enjoy and create memories. we caught speckled trout all night and woke up to the ocean right out our window. I cut my finger on the pier and Carls house had all the supplies I needed to bandage myself up. They also leave complementary items in the pantry. I won’t go to any other place in Baffin Bay after this experience. This place is awesome and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good time. I will definitely be back!

Stayed with kids","The home was very comfortable and Carl was very quick to respond and accommodating to any request we had. The fishing was just amazing, the speckled trout run right at the end of the dock. We did stick it out one night and fished til 1 am, we able to reel in 2 very nice black drum but with out a net the broke the line trying to pull up the line (using 20lb leader). Bring a net if you decide to come. My daughter had the time of her life reeling in trout after trout. My family made some great memories there and we can't thank Carl enough to opening up his home for the opportunity."

Group trip","My girlfriend and I along with 6 of our other friends just stayed here this past weekend as we were attending a friend’s wedding and noticed that this place was under 10 minutes away from it. This place is super spacious and has a very beautiful scenery surrounding it. The patio outside was the perfect place to hang out. It is walking distance from King’s Inn, which sits right on the bay. We had a great time staying here, and if we are ever in town, we will stay here again!"

Stayed with kids","We absolutely loved Abbey’s place! We were there for my mother in law’s funeral so having a homie place to come to and get ready was comforting! Beautiful scenery, very much peaceful and we had absolutely everything we needed plus more! Kitchen was well equipped , bedrooms had extra linens and pillows we just loved everything about it! The only thing was that we really didn’t get a chance to enjoy the backyard amenities but will for sure next time. We had no complaints whatsoever and we will for sure be staying here again if Abbey will have us.
Thank you Abbey for making us feel welcome and comfortable even though it was a difficult time for us.
May God bless you and your family"

The place was clean, neat, and had very comfortable beds to sleep on. Wi-Fi and Internet worked great. Really cool outdoor covered porch area with tv, tables, chairs, smoker/grill. Awesome place all around! Will for sure be coming back again."

Stayed with a pet","We (dog William and I) really enjoyed our stay at Baffin Breeze. The home was clean, well-stocked with toiletries/accoutrements and extremely comfortable. It is obvious the owners have put some serious effort into making the home both enjoyable and laid back. The backyard is HUGE, with a fantastic screened cabana, including grills, propane heater and big screen TV. Plus a dang nice dog kennel.
Both of the local convenience stores are within biking/walking distance, as is Kings Inn restaurant.
I’ve stayed at a few Airbnbs up and down the Tx coast and will deservedly say this is the nicest. Further, it is far and away the best pet friendly place I’ve ever rented. Get there, open the backyard gate and turn the pets and kids loose - both they and you will love it!!!
Oh, and the snowbird neighbors are simply precious ❤️"

Stayed a few nights","Liisa’a place was very spacious and extremely well supplied. I was visiting Kingsville with my sister and my 82 year old for my son’s Senior Day/weekend celebration at TAMUK. We were extremely close to the school. I wanted to have space where I could spend time with my son when he wasn’t playing baseball and the house was perfect. We were able to cook meals, sit indoors or out, enjoy each others company and it was all on one level which is very important for my aging dad. And further, we accidentally broke something while we were there, when I contacted Liisa to see about how I could get it fixed she kindly responded for us to not worry about it and that she would look into it after we had left. HIGHLY recommend this beautiful place and I will definitely book again when I come back to visit."

Stayed with a pet","Liisa's Kingsville home is perfect - spotlessly clean, nicely decorated, remodeled kitchen. I loved the fenced-in backyard for my pup. We traveled all day in the car to get to Kingsville, so he was ready to romp when we arrived. Liisa responded promptly when I had a question about the keypad, and offered a refund when I had to leave town earlier than expected. This is a great property to choose when in Kingsville."

We also used the grill for a grill-out one night. The house was spotless and had everything we needed. We appreciated the detailed instructions and helpful signage around the house. Our pups especially appreciated the fenced in backyard while me and my husband appreciated the patio furniture so we could all enjoy the outdoors. Liisa was also very responsive, accommodating and assisted in the return of some items we had left at the house. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely return the next time we visit Kingsville."

When I called her to ask she stated she had known a week before that a bed is missing because it broke. I wish she would have communicated that to me instead of me having to find out for myself. Also I don’t believe her bed sizes are too accurate either. Other than that she provided a nice house with a good location

Stayed with a pet","Lovely home nicely decorated with a long private pier for fishing. We brought our 2 large dogs & the front yard is a good size & fenced in. We also took them to the pier with us when fishing which worked well, but some dogs may be too afraid to walk it since there are spaces between the planks. Also might be important to know that dogs aren’t allowed in bedrooms. Our fault we didn’t read that before booking. One of our dogs can’t handle not being with us at night (he trained us well) so one of us just slept in the living room. There’s a nearby convenience store with pretty much everything you may need, in addition to what is provided in the house. Overall, would recommend for your south Texas fishing trip!"

1st off we were traveling from Iowa. and not one time was i worried about the place because Ben answered any questions i did have.
2nd the place was easy to find and centrally located.
3rd the people that work at the two convience store are very helpful and respectful to a few out of town tourist. helped us figure out what fish were biting on and gear we may want/need. The one place even had margaritas to go!(made the wife happy, so that made me happy)
4th if you are looking for a great seafood place that is near. BAFFIN BAY SEAFOOD it is about 10 minutes down the road. they d amazing and right next door is a little bitty bar called Tooters. the bartender we had the night we went was very nice felt like home in our little small town we live in. i suggest stopping in the first day your trip. she knows where good places to fish if you choose to explore. and other fun little things.
Thank you Ben, money well spent!"

Stayed with a pet","Ben’s place is very nice and extremely well appointed. I brought cooking spices, coffee, charcoal, etc, but didn’t even have to unpack it. The home itself is very comfy and quiet. My dog enjoyed the fenced yard and walks around the milo field across the road. Ben was very communicative throughout the entire process, proactively Informing me of potential early check-in and other issues deserving of my attention. It really was a very nice trip and experience. I have frequented 4 different Tx coast Airbnbs in the past couple of years and Ben’s is the one I will book in the future.
The drum rib plate at Baffin Bay Seafood was fabulous, as were the onion rings. Very pleasant/helpful staff and a cool vibe right on the bay. I’m sure the other restaurant is also nice, but I didn’t have time to eat there.
Personally, I think this part of the Tx coast is a hidden gem. Alas, probably not for long….."

Stayed with kids","Aptly named, Shangri-la is a special place- Definitely on our ""must return to"" list!
Listing is accurate; details from reviews are helpful; tried to avoid repeating them:

4-night stay, family of 4 (2 teenage boys); brought fishing kayaks.
The pier was the winner re: catching the most fish! In total, we caught ~50: speckled trout, black drum, redfish, lady fish, hardheads. Keepers: 6; biggest: 24"" black drum. Never lost a hook/had to cut a line.
For us: Wind was calmest 1st thing in the AM, always blew inland; returning in kayaks was easy. Kayaks moored at the shoreline boardwalk.
Bait shops: Open at 4:30am; nearly sold out by 6am. Most success with live shrimp.
Location is awesome: fishing & privacy, also getting provisions. Made all meals in-house, great grill! Next time, Baffin Bay Seafood/ King's Inn!
Ben is an awesome host! Responsive & helpful, obvious he wants your stay to be amazing! Great instructions (listing/check-in + signage).
Thx, Ben! Excited for next time!"

Nice fenced yard for our fur babies which were welcomed with open arms by owner. The kitchen was more than adequate with just about anything you could need in food prep. If I lived there I would have to make the shower head adjustable for short people. We had trouble keeping our hair dry, but who cares when you away from the world, right?

The house is well stocked with spices, utensils, towels, etc. It is obvious the owners wanted it to feel like home, and it does. I have been to other airbnbs where it's pretty bare bones. No spices, 4 forks, 4 spoons, and so on, but not here.
Fishing the first night was sparse. The next 2 nights were great. Ended up with 20 speckle trout keepers. But fished more than enough, my wife was tired of fishing after 3 hours due to not being able to sit down because we were constantly catching a fish.
Overall, if you like to fish, enjoy peace and quiet, and love the convenience of a private pier, this is a great place. We will be coming back this summer for sure."

Close to the bait shop, King’s Inn, and Kingsville is just a 20 minute drive away where there are other restaurants, the famous King Ranch, and good grocery stores. Ben was very responsive to me each day when I asked about fishing suggestions for the current weather. It was cold and windy which made fishing difficult, but we still had a great time. My husband caught 25-30 trout one night, but only one was of legal keeping size. He says he caught 6 in a row even! Two keeper Black Drum as well. Overall it was a fabulous place to spend time as a family to relax, play games, watch movies, and fish to our hearts’ content. The pier is very stable, well lighted along the walkway, lights to allow night fishing, and a fish cleaning table with water and lights. Go see Baffin Bay and this special little piece of heaven!"

Stayed with a pet","What a perfect place for us as a couple and our golden retriever for our 9-night stay -- private, safe, quiet, peaceful! Ben's place is 'well-loved' and comfortable. We had everything we needed and expected, and more. The fishing was great for late December, once it warmed up a bit outside (got as cold as the mid 20s for the first couple of nights we were there.) We got several dozen black drum and a 19"", 7 pound sheepshead! The pier and T-head lighting was exceptional, the best of any of the nearby piers. The barbeque smoker worked great. The place is well-kept and clean, the bed comfortable, and the Internet sufficient. Phone cell service was very good the entire time. There's an HEB supermarket about 20 minutes away in Kingsville, and the local convenience store (less than a mile away, easy walking distance) had bait and fishing supplies. Corpus Christi and North Padre Island are about an hour away. A great Airbnb for us. We very highly recommend Ben's Shangri-La Cabin & Pier!"

Stayed a few nights","This little waterfront gem will not disappoint!
It offers great bay views, peaceful surroundings, great fishing and a well equipped house that makes you feel right at home! Well manicured lawn, house smelled fresh and was very clean. We brought K-cups for the coffee maker but realized it was a regular coffee maker, but we were very pleased there was coffee stocked available for us to use!! There are only 2 local bait shops so if you plan on using live bait be sure to purchase enough for your stay because they may not get more delivered; they both ran out of live bait very early Saturday morning and did not get delivered. Thankfully the host recommended lure of choice information in the listing/check-in information and the lures worked great!!
The host (Ben) was very quick to respond to questions so I'd give communication an A+. Gaining access to the property was stress free and the property felt safe.
You know your trip was awesome when there's nothing to complain about, you can't stop saying ""that was an awesome weekend"" and you're already thinking about when to make your next reservation.
Thank you Ben...we're already looking at the calendar for future reservations!!!

Stayed a few nights","First, you have to know where you are going and what you should expect. If you haven’t been to Riviera/Loyola Beach, you shouldn’t expect super, high-end luxury. It’s a S. Texas community catering to sport fishing. There aren’t as many people or restaurants as Port A or Rockport.
When we arrived it was easy to find and enter the property. Through a scheduling hiccup, the place hadn’t been cleaned. I contacted the owner, and he was really responsive and decisive. He got the cleaners there within 30 minutes, and refunded the cleaning fee. Things go wrong. It’s how someone responds that makes the difference.
The cabin was just what we needed for a couple of old fishing buddies to spend a few days/nights hanging out, telling lies, and catching some fish. The trout bite was on two of three nights (the wind stymied us on one night). Our fishing guide for a half day wade-fishing trip (Storm and Mason from La Pesca) picked us up at the on-site dock. Super convenient!!!
It was a great stay, and we’ll certainly be back."

Stayed with a pet","This is a one of a kind place on Baffin Bay that offered us a fantastic weekend of fishing and a very hopeful New Years toast in these tumultuous times.
The place has got to be the tidiest fish camp I have ever stayed; the interior décor and tasteful touches made us feel right at home just steps away from the bay. The lighted pier offered exclusive fishing into the late night as we took full advantage of the December trout bite - readily hitting our lures just after sundown. We even tangoed with a few feisty Reds while we at it. Be sure to bring your crab pot too as good sized Blue Crabs frequent the bottom and will provide tasty variety at the dinner table.
During our stay a strong Blue Norther blew through and we kept warm and cozy sipping our coffee watching the seabirds as their winter pattern took course, thousands of pelicans in flight high above seeking safe harbor inland. This is a place for all seasons, warm or cold - fishing or not, a calm and welcoming place to share with those closest to you. The furry ones too."

Stayed with kids","This was a wonderful location with amazing views at all times of the day! We loved sitting out on the pier early morning and most of the evening. Weather was too windy to catch much of anything other than small hardheads and a couple of small sheepsheads but it did not stop us from fishing! Baffin Bay Seafood is a 10 min drive and a great night out with some of the best seafood we’ve ever had! Will definitely go back! Browns convenient store is about a 2-3 min drive and had everything you could need from bait/fishing gear to your basic grocery needs! Communication with Ben was super prompt. Please note that yes, the front of the yard is fenced in but not the back which was a little disappointing because your time is spent in the back and we couldn’t let our dog roam around since there are collarless neighborhood dogs that like to visit daily! One even came up on the porch early morning which set our dog off to barking. Mosquitos were insane in the front yard but fortunately none of them made it to the back. Don’t let the last 2 deter you because this is truly a gem! Hopefully we have better weather next time! Thank you for sharing your slice of heaven with us!"

Stayed a few nights","Absolutely Shangri La. if you’re reading the reviews, then you’re probably looking to get away to a private, rural area. This place is a fisherman’s dream. We caught so many fish and even landed a 44” bull red. The water quality is incredibly clean in the bay, and the fish are extremely healthy looking. At night, you can see EVERY SINGLE STAR in the sky. Make sure you follow the regular fishing laws and regulations. We had a game warden surprise us on the pier at night! Officer White was very friendly told us about the area and what people were catching (aka not much, but we were pulling up tons of drum and trout on shrimp.) The convenience store nearby said they won’t have live shrimp until March, but they have frozen shrimp, the frozen mullets they sell at buccees and squid. Can’t tell you how awesome this place is. Hope to own a place like this someday!!! Thank you so much Ben. Would love to return as often as possible."

They had fishing gear to use which was great and the corner store down the road had additional tackle if you don’t want to drive into Kingsville.
The stay had all the cooking essentials. Sometimes stays provide the bare minimum for cooking, but this is outfitted with everything you need as far as pots, pans, cutting boards, etc. as if you are at home.
They pretty much thought of everything.
The beds were very comfortable. The washer and dryer was perfect especially after fishing.

Stayed a few nights","Terence is a great host and the house is amazing. It is right across the street from the university. Very quiet, yet lots going on just a block or two away. We walk to sports events and a night race on a beautiful evening. There is so much room in the house that everyone can spread out and have their own spot. I will definitely get this place again if possible. The price is very very reasonable."

My family of 4 (2 small children) and several extended family members convened in Kingsville to celebrate the life of our recently passed Grandmother, and the accommodations were exactly what we needed - centrally located and with plenty of space, even for a couple rambunctious 3 year olds.
Terence went above and beyond with multiple personal touches that really helped turn a tough weekend into one we will never forget. We are forever grateful for his hospitality, and know exactly where we will be staying during our next visit to Kingsville. Thank you, Terence!"

Stayed a few nights","Look no further, Casa Riata is the place to stay! I was in town for academic research at TAMUK. The house is across the street and was a 5-minute walk for me to the center of campus. Campus is accessible in other ways beside walking if you need options.
Terry is an amazing host! He was very helpful for questions about amenities and responded within minutes to questions. His communication was engaging from the moment that I booked all the way through my departure. He reached out periodically to make sure that I was doing well and asked if I needed anything. Nice touch, Terry!
I brought my mother with me on the trip. She is 78 and really appreciated the easy access to the house, the rooms, and especially enjoyed reading on the patio. The preset nightlights made navigating the house simple and safe while we learned the layout.
I love to cook and enjoy my morning coffee. The kitchen is amazing and well fortified. The coffee bar is so inviting. Thank you, Terry, for a fantastic experience!"

Stayed with a pet","We were in town visiting my son in his freshman year at school, and felt right at home! Omar was incredibly proactive with communication, and my son in particular loved the full sized washer and dryer so mom could do his laundry 😂 our dogs loved the big backyard, and so did we - it was a really neat space to relax. At first glance the neighborhood seemed a little worrisome, but we quickly changed our mind - we never felt unsafe, and although in a college town near campus we were never disturbed with loud parties nearby. I would absolutely stay again!"

the rental is very nice on the inside, updated and clean.

The neighbors are friendly and keep to themselves. I had many packages delivered and had no issues with any of those packages disappearing. Unfortunately Kingsville does not take care of their streets which has nothing to do with this house. The house is in walking distance to the college campus which is lit up while it's dark so you are able to take walks and runs at anytime of the day. The house was very clean and has a good set up. The house has open floor plan so you don't feel crowded. There was a nice little patio in backyard. The Backyard was clean and cut. The Owner had good communication with me and did check periodically to make sure I had everything I needed. The check in and check out was very simple and fast. I would stay here again if I am in the area and would suggest it to others.

Stayed a few nights","We wanted a private home in the country with a peaceful atmosphere and that’s what we got. While there are some quirks to staying in the country, we loved the whole nature experience. The hosts have a birdbath and feeder that supplied us with views of some pretty awesome birds, like the green jay. The house is decorated very warm, with a cute country style, and had a very comfy mattress. The toaster oven worked well for heating up leftovers. The hosts were very thoughtful, even providing local honey as I mentioned seasonal allergies. Our only recommendation would be to bring a roll of paper towels for convenience.
Thanks to Karlene and Ruben for a very enjoyable stay! Rick and Cindy"

Stayed a few nights","Was a great place to stay! Would recommend having a car when staying here because it is not super close to amenities. It is very dark at night so I didn't always feel super safe walking to and from the house. Linda was great, I had some travel issues initially and she was willing to discuss a refund. Luckily it all worked out, but I appreciated her being willing to be flexible about the booking."

Linda was very responsive with my questions, great host. The only thing we had a small issue with was shared parking with the neighbor, we spoke with her and she was very pleasant, but we ended up having a minor emergency and our car was blocked in. The location is right as you are pulling into town so there is a short drive for food and gas."

If you going down this Airbnb is as cheap as a hotel ,but you get a backyard, washer and dryer, and a fully functioning kitchen. I can confidently say I’ll be staying there again ,and a responsive host and the sweetest cleaning lady right next door for anything you need help with. It’s 10 times better then a hotel ,and at an affordable price ,this is a must stay at place if your going to be in town for a few nights."

Stayed a few nights","The place is not bad, but the bed sheets were not clean which is a deal breaker especially without a washer and dryer. I asked for clean sheets, but the spare sheets were also not so clean. I would have spent money on repairs before all those decisions. Altogether it was cheap and decent enough for us.
Replace the rusty window in the bathroom.
Install exhaust vent in the bathroom.
Clean out mold building up in the AC.
there was a smell of stagnant water that was either the bathroom sink not draining properly or the AC unit.
Wash the sheets the day of guest check in.
It's really not a bad place to stay. If it had a little more love, it would be great."

We were visiting the area for the weekend from Canada, to see my son who attends TAMUK and plays on their baseball team. The opportunity to spend some time outdoors in the backyard is very welcoming when you are coming from snow! I would definitely stay there again."

Stayed with kids","We were in Kingsville for my stepson's wedding so we booked this house instead of a hotel and we feel so lucky to have found it! We absolutely LOVED this house, LOVED it! It was the perfect size, very clean, we loved the decor and furnishings. It is such a cute house and we felt very cozy and at home. We loved the small touches such as the personalized welcome sign we saw right as we walked in, we liked the blankets provided in the living room to use while watching TV, we saw there were a few board games provided. We didn't use them, but that was a nice option to have in case we did. The location was nice, close to everything we needed. We really liked the backyard and the patio with the table, chairs and grill. We didn't get an opportunity to use it, but had we had the time, we totally would have. We actually wish we had more down time to be able to just hang out in the house and use the backyard. We'll definitely stay here again should the need arise!!"

Thanks a million!"

Stayed a few nights","We may be worth the first people to stay here as an Airbnb, but we might have been. The hosts have obviously put a TON of work and sweat into transforming a rough looking bungalow into a beautiful cottage. We especially enjoyed the new covered patio in the backyard with a grill. The local friends who we were in town to visit came over and immediately marked it down on their list of places to suggest."

H.E.B. was just a couple of blocks away; perfect!"

The beds were very comfortable and we slept great. The house was nicely decorated and the a/c worked great in this Texas heat. We will definitely recommend this rental to our friends and family. Johnny and Prissy were great hosts and were very helpful. 10/10 recommend!

Kitchen had everything needed to cook; assorted pots and pans, cutlery, dishes, cops, etc. I forgot to bring some spices but there were some and even cooking oil! However, if you forget or need anything, there is an HEB about 3 blocks away! Towels available including shampoo, and body wash. Very clean and organized; very nicely decorated house. Washer/dryer was available, that’s always a perk. Internet TV in living room and bedrooms. AC worked great, no issues. Neighborhood was quiet and we felt safe. Very conveniently located to downtown and university areas. We had no issues with check-in/out; instructions very clear. Never once did we have to call the host for anything. Highly recommend this place! It’s a much better stay than a hotel!"
