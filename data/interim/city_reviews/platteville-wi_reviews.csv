Stayed a few nights","If you are looking for nostalgia- this is the place for you! We absolutely loved the entire space. Very thoughtful amenities, plenty of bath towels, a fun space to be productive if you’re looking for a getaway to get some writing done. (Finished my first novella!) excellent internet connection too! We had so much fun at the Car Wash and also in town. The Burg had amazing food - and the Grindstone Pub is new- but a great place to unwind with a cocktail and watch a game. We will definitely be booking again!"

The shower is original and a good size. Plenty of hot water and the magnets on the shower curtain were a nice touch. The kitchen has what is needed for a weekend getaway. Just a short walk or drive to downtown Shullsburg. The entire place is so original and fun! No issues and no complaints at all. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again!

The shower design is not to be missed.
Hosts are very friendly and responsive, too. Wished we had more time, but we had only a two-day stay and we were in Platteville for a campus weekend event. We will be back, tho! Thank you Betsy and Thomas!"

Stayed a few nights","The Car Wash Inn was definitelya unique stay! From the truck that looks like its coming outof the building to the amazing decorative touches, everything was cohesive and went together well. The CarWash was clean and neatly styled, had all of the amenities listed in the description and had something different to see no matter where you looked. I think my favorites were the bathroom door, the night stands and the kitchen cabinets. I would absolutely recommend the Car Wash Inn, just make sure to check the weather. It rained the entire time we were there, but we made the most of it🙃"

Beyond the wow factor, the Inn is clean, cozy and stocked with all amenities you’d require for a comfortable stay. The downtown is just a short walk away and loaded with charm. Stop by the coffee shop for a phenomenal homemade cinnamon roll and coffee to start the day right.
Will definitely look to return to the Car Wash on our next “drift less” motorcycle excursion!"

We enjoyed sitting outside during cocktail hour and got a kick off all the waves from cars as they went by. We ate at The Burg twice. Every bite was delicious and we particularly enjoyed the soup.

The hosts were very personable and responsive, the theme was done so well (down to the very last detail) and the space had everything we needed for a nice family getaway. Highly recommend!"

The loft area is super spacious and the bed was comfortable. The perfect end to the evening was sitting out by the fire. It was completely private and forgot there was even another cottage nearby. Ashley was very communicative. Checking in and out was easy. Would love to visit again!

Their dog Ellie met us and was so sweet and kind but we felt so safe with her keeping guard of the farmstead. We got to meet the goats, chickens, ducks and kitties! It was a therapeutic getaway you couldn't find anywhere else! The cottage was very comfortable and cozy!! It was also spotless thanks Cid!! The cottage was built with great taste and they really outdid it!! I wonder why someone would want to book a hotel when you have such a beautiful and serene getaway for such a great price! Thank you so much Ashley, Jeremiah, Cid and Ellie!! We'll be back soon :)"

It was too cold on the weekend we stayed to have a fire or really be outside at all. The kitchen is well appointed. The coffee and honey provided were tasty. Be aware that the electric skillet has some vintage charm and is not non-stick. It worked well for our needs and cleaned up fairly easily. The cabin was clean and well organized.

It has woods all around and is set away from their house for great privacy. The ladder up to the loft is steep but very well-made and sturdy. The bed in the loft was very comfortable. The heat is easy to control (use the fan on low to circulate the warm air). We recommend slippers. I can't say enough about how delightful the animals were. The goats are so friendly. You get to go into their enclosure - we had much fun making friends with them. Their watchdog Ellie is a big love."

The inside was airy and filled with light, and the beds were super comfy. Cool copper elements through the kitchen and bathroom give a modern but warm feel.
We were greeted by a sweet black kitten and later, a friendly grey cat. The grounds were beautiful with outdoor lighting, wind chimes, and interesting trees and flowers. What a gorgeous property!
And the animals!! We hung out with and fed all the goats (carrots and apples brought from home) and the Highland cow, and watched the chickens and ducks waddle around. Their Great Pyrenees (Bella, I think?) was so sweet and friendly.
We’d definitely stay with Ashley and Jeremiah again! Great communication throughout, from check in to check out! Thanks for a peaceful retreat! We’ll be back!"

The lights were gorgeous at night, the space was cozy without feeling too cramped, while still having enough for what we needed. Ashley had everything you could possible need there--which worked out as someone made away with our toothpaste bag while hauling our wedding stuff for us! We plan to make it back sometime, this time with some more of our things and an idea of what to do :)"

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I spent a few days at the cottage to get away for our 10 year wedding anniversary. It was probably the hottest day of the year, but we still enjoyed our stay! The cottage was beautiful, the property was amazing, and we had so much fun exploring! We were greeted by the sweetest cats, and later their kittens, all were incredibly friendly. The goats and Annabel, their mini cow, were so entertaining! If it weren’t for the heat, we would have spent more time with them.
The cottage was very cozy, clean, and well decorated. The ladder up to the loft was a little intimidating at first, but we got used to it quickly. The town of Darlington, as well as surrounding town, all had something to offer. It’s definitely small town living, which we love, but we understand it may not be for everyone. You do have access to whatever you would need close by.
We will definitely be visiting again! ♥️♥️♥️"

It was the most beautifully appointed AirBnb I have ever stayed at. They left out no details in making sure that the space is comfortable…from the plush towels, to the assortment of coffees, teas, and snacks. They also invite guests to enjoy interacting with their goats, dog, and cats. As cat lovers, we had a blast playing with their very affectionate 4 kittens!
Be ready to hike up the ladder to enjoy the comfort of the bed in the attic."

Stayed with kids","My family had a lovely stay in Darlington at the Arbor Crest Cottage. The property is beautiful, with natural landscaping and lit paths with string lights surrounding the cottage. We felt welcome to wander and meet the animals, including goats, ducks, chickens, and very sweet cats and a dog. Our 1.5-year old had so much fun exploring. It is both quiet and private, but also easily accessible by road. The cottage itself was well-equipped for our needs. We were able to grill and relax by the fire pit, and we all slept well. The town of Darlington is charming, with a gelato spot, a local pharmacy, and a great bar/restaurant called Glennies where we had breakfast every morning. We also bought wonderful produce at an Amish farmstand on Saturday morning, and did a short hike at nearby Yellowstone Lake State Park. We were so pleased with our mini vacation in Darlington!"

Stayed a few nights","My roommate and I booked Ashley’s place for a little getaway — we were drawn by all the animals but got so much more! We spent a majority of our time on the property and we were incredibly pleased. Arbor Crest Cottage was peaceful, there were many places to go outside to rest and enjoy nature. The animals are so fun and friendly, we loved getting to spend mornings and evenings on the porch with their cats, stubby and nickel.
Being a lover of cooking, I was concerned about not having a stove/oven, but the electric skillet they provided worked perfectly for a few home cooked meals.
Ashley was very communicative and accommodating, she also does an amazing job of anticipating others needs. All of her instructions were clear, from arrival details to checking out.
We are so grateful for our getaway at Arbor Crest and we hope to be back sometime in the future!!"

Stayed a few nights","There’s so much you could say about this cottage, however you only get so many words for reviews. This was the most peaceful & cleanest Airbnb we’ve ever stayed at. You can feel the cottage was built with love & is maintained with love. It’s over three years old & still looks brand new.
Ashley is an amazing host. Super friendly & responsive to messages. Offers suggestions when asked. We were looking for somewhere to have brunch & something to do on a Sunday. She pointed us in the direction of Galena & a restaurant on the way. Both were amazing experiences.
The goats love people & snacks, definitely bring snacks. Ellie is so precious & nice. The ducks love you from afar. A couple cats will follow you all over as you are walking, but will keep their distance unless you invite them to you.
As a plus size female (26w) the cottage was very comfortable. Don’t be intimidated by the loft ladder. It will support you! It will take a couple times to get used to, don’t let it scare you!"

Ashley clearly goes above and beyond for the guests she hosts, with clear and simple check-in instructions, a binder full of recommendations, and a beautiful space to stay. It’s not a completely private space, there is another Airbnb and Ashley/Jeremiah’s main house on the property, however the spaces are sectioned off well and it definitely doesn’t feel like you’re really around other people at all. Feeding the goats every morning was so enjoyable, they’re incredibly funny to watch. Their dog Ellie is such a sweetheart as well, and we loved having the cats follow us around everywhere. All their animals were extremely friendly and very enjoyable to watch. Every once and a while we crossed paths with Ashley while she fed the goats, she was very friendly and gives great recommendations for anything you’d need! The care-taker of the cottage was extremely friendly as well and always nice to run into!"

Before I even arrived, the cottages caretaker noticed an issue that needed attention. It was not something that made the place less hospitable, it just needed a simple fix. Ashley proactively reached out and offered me their other cottage. I didn’t feel like I needed the switch but they wanted to be good hosts and asked if I minded. I didn’t!
Both cottages onsite were beautiful with so much attention paid to design and detail. The property is serene and beautiful! I aqua looking for a few low key days in a cozy cabin! Arbor Crest did not disappoint! This might be one of the best Airbnb finds I’ve ever had. I am seriously so impressed!
Ashley was super responsive, accommodating, and kind. I loved, loved , loved the goats, kittens, chickens, ducks and other wildlife found around the property. I missed Ellie but I’m sure I’ll see her one day. I definitely want to go back!"

Stayed a few nights","Great place to stay- very clean and comfortable. Large well-equipped kitchen for preparing meals and plenty of room for dining. The location was perfect for our needs- close to family. It’s quite rural but lovely.
We had trouble finding the place. The problem was with google maps, not the hosts. We drove in from New York, arrived at night and the gps took us up the road, wrong side of the road, near the local gas station that was closed. Pretty stressful, as it was too dark to see house numbers and the phone number provided went to a recording. Somehow, my nephew was able to track the addresses along the highway on his map app and get us to the right address about a 1/4 mile down the highway. Not the fault of the owners at all, but they may want to give a heads up or some additional verbal directions.
All in all, it was a great place to stay and we will definitely be back."

Another plus was the (king) bed, very comfortable. Internet was great and supports streaming with no lag. Washer and dryer available but we didn't use it.

Group trip","THE BEST AIRBNB HOSTS AND AIRBNB PLACE MY GROUP AND I HAVE EVER STAYED IN! There are no words to describe how perfect our weekend was. First of all, they were so accommodating and flexible with us. Jolene reached out about staying an extra night due to our safety from a snow storm, which was something we didn't expect at all. Second, the airbnb itself - the construction of it, the decor, the space that we had was exceptional. The pictures did not do it justice! Not only was the check in and check out smooth, the time in between was also great; they updated us on how the how the roads were with the snow and even offered to drive us to the stores. In addition, they had 2 dogs that were on guard for their livestock and they were so sweet and made sure we were protected as well. It was also a good driving distance to Chestnut Mountain (ski/snowboard) and the town, Galena. Overall, I can't emphasize enough how great the experience was. I'd recommend to anyone and everyone if I could!!!"

My boyfriend and I booked her place for a peaceful birthday weekend and we got just that. Do be warned there is a train that passes by in front of the house. If you’re a light sleeper it might wake you up. The whole house shakes but I promise it’s worth the view. We definitely didn’t mind it.

We were very happy with the entire accommodations. It's very obvious that a lot of care goes into the vacation rental. This was a total gem and very charming place you have. If you are looking for a beautiful scenery and just a peacefulness about the surroundings this, is it. It is very clean and everything that was needed was available. Julie and Jim are friendly people, and we can't wait to return to hear more stories and to explore more of the area. Thanks again for sharing your little piece of quietness.
We will be back!
J&C and River too"

Stayed one night","What can I honestly say? This house is a HOME! & has the most perfect location. The sound of the waves all day and night, & the sound of the trains passing by were so amazing. the comfort in knowing that I was staying in an exceptionally clean environment and ALL of the accessible amenities. It was perfect. We can't wait to go back. The lake view is definitely unforgettable. My plus one and I had the best time and now the warmest memories! It's a place l'll definitely recommend to friends and family. So if you're looking at this house now, don't think twice, you've found it! Julie was also a friendly and responsive host. Thanks for that, we appreciate it. Hope we can make it back one day!"

Stayed with a pet","I needed a quiet place to work while my husband visited with his family and friends in his hometown of Dubuque and this home was perfect. My dogs loved running in the grass and laying in their dog bed, looking out the window. Seeing the sunrise was breathtaking. The home was cozy and warm and beautifully decorated. The only thing that was unusual was the lack of water pressure, but it wasn't a big deal for us. We loved staying there and highly recommend it!"

There are a couple trains that go by each day, seems like mostly in the mornings. They go very slowly and are not bothersome at all.
The property has a lovely view of the river, and some great sunrises!
Thanks for having us!"

Stayed with a pet",I was looking for a last-minute night away from home to relax. I wanted to bring my dog as I had worked a lot recently and didn’t want to board her. The little “train” by the tracks and river was perfect. We walked a little and enjoyed the wildlife on the river. Loved the swing. I was able to let my dog off her leash some as she’s not one to wander and there was no one close by or traffic. I felt safe as a single woman traveler. I went home refreshed and ready go back to work on Wednesday. Thanks Julie for allowing pets. I hope to visit again.

There were binoculars, so we watched the various types of waterfowl in the area. During our stay, we saw 3 bald eagles and many American Coot as well as possibly some pelicans further up the river.
Our host was very responsive and also communicated to us about things on their end as well. The home was very comfortable and had everything we needed.
If they have us again, we would like to make use of the fire ring and sit outside and enjoy nature even more. We highly recommend staying here!"

We were able to see lots of wildlife on the river right from the living room and kitchen. Julie had even provided some binoculars to give better vision! The house was extremely well kept and had lots to do. If you're looking for a place to stay that is only a few minutes from downtown and local attractions but is also free of city noise, stay here. You'll be steps from the river, have a beautiful campfire area with lighted trees and ample chairs, and able to enjoy nature."

Fascinating to watch the trains ambling slowly along and the abundant wildlife. Snapped some nice photos. We enjoyed the spectacular Harvest Moon Rise over the Wisconsin side of the river shortly after we arrived, which was echoed by a glorious sunrise the next morning. While Dubuque offers a plethora of coffee shops, we had the perfect spot right on the river to enjoy our coffee in the morning. Very restful, trouble-free stay. Our hosts could not have been more responsive and delightful to chat with. We have already planned a return trip."

Stayed one night","If you would like a place for two to stay in Platteville, but you don’t want to stay in a hotel, check out Vikki’s studio apartment. The character, quaint street and home, and well-supplied kitchen and bath, were just perfect.
We stayed during a December cold snap, but making the room extra toasty warm was as easy as keeping the bathroom door open and closing the double doors that open up to the windowed porch and the cute kitchen.
The towels were luxurious, large, and soft. The queen-sized memory foam bed was firm, pillows just right, and soft blankets.
The bathroom sink faucet and the shower and shower head could use a little love in the looks department, but both were immaculate, functional, and gave us nice hot water in no time.
Wish we could have stayed longer to make some meals. But no matter— we will be back again next time we visit our two students who are attending UWP. Highly recommend Vikki and John’s studio!"

Stayed a few nights","This was our first tiny house experience and we really enjoyed it! My partner is 6’2’’ and I had expected him to have to duck so he didn't hit his head, but he had tons of space and we never felt constrained. It got lots of natural lighting so it felt very homey and warm. The sofa and bed were very comfortable, and it was clean and well-maintained. We ate our meals out, so we did not use the kitchen. The compost toilet was easy to use and the shower was nice and hot! The owner was quick to respond to any questions we had and bonus, their cat and dog came out to say hello! If you have a student at UW Platteville it is within a block of the campus & an easy walk! So if, like us, you've seen the TV shows on tiny homes and wonder what they are really like, we recommend you go check this one out!"

Be mindful to read instructions and full details on accommodation as it is a tiny house. There is a ladder to climb to your loft where you will blissfully sleep like on a ship's birth. You will not wish to depart- Highly recommend!"

The tiny house was so clean, cozy, bigger than expected, and the perfect spot for the two of us. The huge bed was a huge plus, it was not your typical Airbnb/hotel bed- it was so comfortable!

I would agree with some other reviews that the only hesitation was the composting toilet; however, my husband and I knew that if tiny living was something we wanted to do in the future, we would have to have a similar setup. There were great instructions on using the toilet and our fears were quickly put to rest. We will definitely be booking a longer stay next year and have already recommended the property to our friends, family, and neighbors. Thank you again, Jessica, for sharing your tiny home (and Jazz the cat) with us!"

I loved the peaceful rural-ish setting though it was also easy to access the highway and the town. I loved that it was on the family’s property but also felt secluded, hidden from the house view by a barn. The tiny house was well appointed with everything we needed to cook on site. My daughter loved the meandering cat and horse and donkey and ducks….it was the perfect setting to relax and celebrate before the start of Kindergarten!
It was my first time using a compost toilet and it wasn’t bad! And I was surprised at how easily the full shower fit in such a tiny house. The bathroom room was perfect. The loft was perfect. The kitchen was dreamy. The outside seating area was perfect. What a great stay."

Stayed a few nights","What a beautiful tiny home! We had to arrive late and Jessica was wildly accommodating. Luckily we had a welcoming committee out front in Louie and Duke the resident horse and donkey. Jazz the cat welcomed us formally in the morning.
Jessica was extremely easy to get a whole of and, if we'd needed anything, I know she would have been right on top of it. The area was quiet and the space was clean and well equipped.
The surrounding Platteville area was surprisingly active and it's a gorgeous town. Cannot recommend Badger Brothers Coffee enough. A few of the breakfast spots on the area close firmly at 11 and if you're unlucky like we were they may even close earlier.
I definitely recommend Jessica's Rustica Retreat as a lovely get away or a cute spot for a college visit. Well positioned in a lovely small town that's an easy drove to both Dubuque and Galena. Thank you Jessica for the wonderful Space!"

Stayed a few nights","This ""Tiny Home"" has a lot to offer any guest! Bring only what you truly need for your trip as part of the appeal of this option is ""living with less, so you can enjoy life more!""
I found Jessica's responsive and instructions throughout my stay very helpful and calming to any questions that arose. The livability of this ""Tiny Home"" was very enjoyable to the relaxing escape I was looking for.
The view from inside overlooks a beautiful pasture, with Duke (the horse) and Fat Louie (the mule) there to keep you company. If you're lucky enough to have a rain storm roll through at night, the sound of rain hitting the roof right above the lofted bed provides the best white noise to help you sleep.
Bring a book and a puzzle to help you enjoy the space even more.
I will be back for future visits, and would highly recommend this experience to anyone.

It has a beautiful view looking out over rolling farm land and a few farm animals nearby for company! We found the house inside to be be very clean and have everything we needed. Thank you Jessica for a terrific experience! Blessings to you and your family!!

The bed was very comfortable, and everything that we needed was easily accessible. The compost toilet was intimidating at first, but we quickly figured it out — such a smart idea! I would definitely recommend this place."

Stayed with kids","Our family of 4 enjoyed a weekend in this tiny home! Continuing our family tradition, this getaway was a surprise destination planned by mom! Such a fun reveal when we arrived.
It was certainly cozy for 2 adults and a 7 & 10 year old - just as expected - and we had so much fun! Good thing we like each other so much :)
We had enough space to spread out a bit and play some games at the fold-out table, watch a show, or lounge in the loft. We enjoyed all of the decor and well appointed features, as well as smartly functional use of space. The bathroom was larger than expected.
It was extremely clean and we appreciated the fully stocked kitchen and linens. The composting toilet took some getting used to, but all that was required was to read the instructions.
We liked the setting with animals nearby and did not find noise to be a problem whatsoever - it was actually surprisingly quiet.
Since we stayed on a cold snowy weekend, Jessica was thoughtful in making sure we had an additional space heater to keep the temperature just right.
We had a blast adventuring out into Platteville to hike in the snow at a local state park, look for early deer sheds, climb the Platte Mound M, explore downtown shops, thrift shop, snack on local gourmet popcorn, enjoy a supper club fish fry (with relish tray!), taste local coffee & 7 Hills North beer, and a more.
All in all, we were very comfortable and had fun."

The tiny house was clean, comfortable, had literally everything we could need to have a fun time, and we are already talking about when we can come back next year. The animals on the property were such a great touch and the surrounding land and views were beautiful! We saw two amazing sunsets and overall can’t say enough how much of a wonderful experience we had. PS it has inspired us to seriously consider our own tiny home construction in the future!"

Stayed a few nights","The perfect little stay in Wisconsin. My first experience in a tiny home, and it could not have been better. The location was perfect. You could easily make a day trip to Madison, Dubuque, Galena, or one of the many state parks within an hour or so drive. Or you could just sit outside and enjoy the animals. The horses and donkey were always walking by giving you something to watch, and the ducks were an absolute hoot. All the instructions were provided for the “not normal” house equipment you had to use. They also supplied everything needed in the kitchen. Honestly, it had everything you needed for your stay. Going up and down the stairs to get to the loft was an adjustment, but an adventure at the same time. Overall, this was so much better than just staying in another hotel. If you’re looking for a tiny house to stay in, book this one. I promise you won’t regret it."

Stayed with kids","Jessica's tiny house ""Rustica Retreat"" is a charming and clean space with more than enough room for the two of us and our infant.
The setting is just out of town on their hobby farm, and the house is parked on the other side of the yard from the house which provides privacy. There are animals around, including horses, a donkey, a dog, a cat, and ducks. Jessica and her family work around the property during the day and provide you as much distance as you need, and are quite friendly if you want to chat. The southern-facing entrance with comfy chairs are inviting at the end of the day.
The expectations and directions given by Jessica are spot-on, and instructions on how to use the composting toilet were clear and accurate. I worked remotely through video calls and VPN access (10/10 internet speed and service) for the week while we visited family in the area. I'm not sure I'd recommend this space for mobile children unless they stay on the main floor on an air mattress or the couch as there is no railing on the attic-style bed. The mattress is the most comfortable I've slept on, and there is enough space for someone just under 6' to sit up on the bed. There are plenty of windows for a cool breeze at night and a very effective heater/AC unit above the kitchen counter that cools the entire place down in minutes. (I'll assume seasonally) they have a farm stand with veggies and duck eggs just behind the house.
Next time we're back in Platteville, we'll be contacting Jessica and I'd encourage you to do the same. Thanks Jessica!"

Staying at a tiny home reminds you that you don't need ""stuff"". Just simple things, each other, and to go out and have experiences and make memories and enjoy nature. We would definitely stay again! Very clean, felt safe. Great communication. The sweetest farm cat to greet you! This was our first airb&b experience. We've always wanted to experience a tiny home, so glad this is what we chose. The love these two put into building and designing this home makes it even more special.

Stayed a few nights","Lovely place! It is small, but does not feel tight or cramped. We especially enjoyed watching the sunset over the fields directly in front of the outdoor seating and sitting outside in the summer morning to enjoy the breeze and birds.
The loft area really helps open up the space, however it runs warmer than the rest of the tiny home. In summer, running the A/C set to a cool temp. for a while helped. Should be lovely in the winter, but keep in mind that the lower will be cooler.
If you're uncomfortable with heights, the stairway and loft area might make you uneasy, but just take your time. You get used to it after a day and there are well-placed rails for you to hold on to!
The toilet is …unique… but easy to operate and really not that strange after a few uses.
The water heaters work—very—well! :-) Check the temp. carefully! If the water refuses to heat up because of an empty propane tank, the switch-over is super easy on the exterior of the tiny home.
After reading the description and looking through the pictures, this listing exceeded my expectations and it was a super enjoyable time!"

The composting toilet is super easy to figure out and neat to experience, actually! I had a great time watching the sunsets and the ducks, horses and donkeys wandering by. And I slept well in the super comfortable bed!"

The tiny house is very well made and equipped, and doesn’t feel tiny when you are inside, because the interior space is extremely well designed. Perfectly clean and warm. It is so nice to see the animals hanging around in the fields in the morning. I would definitely go back!"

I was very comfortable during my weekend at the tiny house and would definitely book again. I was visiting Platteville for a photo commission, but I found time to hike above the giant “M,” to hike the gorgeous Round Tree Branch Trail and to discover a quaint little garden by UWP, not even a mile away. I had planned to drive to Galena, but found myself very happy just exploring what Platteville had to offer. I will be recommending this stay to my friends as well!"

My partner and I were looking to see if Tiny House living was for us, so we took a few days to drive up to this little gem and it definitely encouraged us. The directions are flawless and the host, Jessica was wicked fast to respond (the fastest host to respond I've ever experienced). You can't beat the sunrise over the rolling meadows with the donkey and ducks as an added bonus. You'll be well taken care of here, every detail about the tiny house is personal and customized. I highly recommend"

Stayed a few nights","Such a cute place to stay! The pictures do the place justice as I walked into exactly what I was expecting. There are 2 horses and a donkey who live right next to the house and a black cat who is very friendly, they were all so sweet and added to the atmosphere. The way they were able to fit everything you need into that little space is so amazing. The bed was comfortable but I suggest bringing your own pillows, these ones were a bit too big for me. The compost toilet was something to get used to, and the #2 procedure is a little nasty but cover the toilet and your nose and its doable. Jessica was also quick to respond with suggestions for what to do around the area. All around a great place for a little staycation."

We had no trouble making most meals ourselves with the hot plates and toaster oven. Because of COVID we did not spend much time in Platteville, but we did pop into 3 Marias for ice cream which was delicious! And we highly recommend the short trip to Governor Dodge State Park for a day of hiking. Jessica was very quick to respond to all of our questions, and she took care of all our needs. We highly and enthusiastic recommend this Airbnb!"

Also, the farm animals - horse, pony and donkey, and all the ducks, were great to have as neighbors. Finally, the house faces west so had a great view of gorgeous sunsets nightly."

It was actually a little bigger than we expected, or at least felt that way. Jessica herself was very responsive and communicative and made us feel very welcome. Platteville itself turned out to have more going on than we imagined - I suppose because it is a college town. But alas in these Covid times we couldn’t spend too much time out on the town. Maybe next time!"

We were a little intimidated by the compost toilet at first but really it was nothing too difficult and was a lot easier to understand once we had to. The space was small but still spacious with unique ideas for storage like behind the ladder stairs to go up to the bed. We loved having our morning coffee and looking out over at the animals on the land :) Tiny home was a special treat for us. Thanks again for letting us enjoy this home !

My partner and I loved the cleanliness of the home, using the firepit for a winter fire experience, the winter decor, and watching the horses in the morning while eating breakfast. The host was kind enough to clean off our car and shovel us out after the snowstorm!
During our stay, we made the 25 minute drive to Dubuque to hike the Mines of Spain and check out local breweries. We recommend Dimensional for beer quality and Backpocket for the arcade! I’d definitely consider coming back in the future! Thanks again."

Stayed one night","Esther has the whole upstairs of her home for guests. I shared a bathroom which wasn’t a problem at all. I just stayed overnight, so had no time to enjoy all the amenities. I appreciated being able to put items from my cooler in freezer and refrigerator. The house is a bit noisy in that you hear people walking, from hall to room, in their room. But once everyone goes to bed this is no longer a problem. I was doing some writing, so the noisy park kids and the walking in the house were noticeable to me. I could have put ear plugs in but didn’t.
I was so busy getting my stuff inside, I forgot to take my shoes off until after I had brought everything in. My bad!"

Stayed with kids","We stayed one night with a 3yo kid at the cabin. Here are a few pros and cons for those who want to visit.
Let's start with the pros:
1. Great hosting by Jolene. She gets a 5-star for her hosting. She was at the property at our time of arrival but when we were delayed she gave us clear instructions on how to check-in. Within a few minutes of our arrival, she came to visit us and gave instructions on how to use the heater and all other necessary things we needed for our one-night stay.
2. The area was beautiful. It's a great getaway from city life with fresh air.
3. The cabin was very clean and cozy, and the heating system was properly working.
Cons:
1. The only downside is there is no water supply inside the cabin. And the bathroom is outside. There is no water supply in the bathroom as well. Although Jolene clearly mentioned the situation in the description we missed it. However, Jolene kindly gave us access to the Stonehouse bathroom."

Not only was the cabin even cuter than the photos but the landscape around the cabin is breath taking. The driftless region is truly the most beautiful landscape on earth and you can see it on the drive to and from Galena.
Jolene made everything so easy and is very responsive. We felt so at home. Galena was amazing during the day and then it was wonderful to get away from all the people for the night and retreat to the cabin. We have decided to do an annual pilgrimage to Galena and I am already looking forward to my next time at the cabin!"

Stayed a few nights","Great host, wished the bathroom was connected to the cabin and also i wish we were told there was a house right in front, because we were looking for a cabin by itself. And we were looking for a privacy and also they were doing so much work almost nonstop in their other house. Also the wifi was very unstable. But Jolene was a great person to talk too and very friendly."

Stayed a few nights",The photos that are listed for Jolene’s cabin looked so peaceful and beautiful and caught my eye right away. Pulling onto her property was so much more than the pictures could show. The chicken coop turned into a cabin is unbelievable and seeing it in the pictures does not capture the beautiful inside and all of the details they put into it to make you wonder how it could have been anything but this adorable cabin. I just needed a couple peaceful days to myself to unplug and relax and it was perfect. The roosters in the morning made me feel like I was in a whole different time and I just thought how great it’d be to have them in my yard 🤗May not be some peoples idea of peaceful But I loved it 😊 there is also a beautiful duck pond. Jolene was available at all times for anything I needed or any questions I had. Just an overall amazingly beautiful stay and I will be back! I encourage all to experience this beautiful place. Either by yourself or with your family it will NOT disappoint! ❤️

Stayed a few nights","When I first stumbled upon this cabin on AirBnB, it seemed almost too good to be true. But everything was as perfect as it seemed online. Jolene is the most thoughtful, gracious host.
She provided us with all the information we needed. The cabin and surroundings were just perfect. Very peaceful location!
The bed was comfortable and the fireplace in the bedroom was the perfect touch for a comfy sleep. Clean outhouse and shower outside! Location is incredible and about a 25 minute drive to downtown Galena.
Jolene was of great help. She went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable and memorable. The cabin was spotless and there is a cute fire pit outside with livestock around you that never bothered us!
Thank you Jolene for a wonderful weekend, we did not want to leave. We definitely will return!"

The shower had great hot water pressure. I only had the time to shower and sleep so didn't have the opportunity to meet Esther personally but she was great with correspondence. Let me also add a note about how clean this house is, professional level clean. I was very pleased with my stay and would recommend. Just be aware that there is a shared bathroom which was not a problem for my stay."
