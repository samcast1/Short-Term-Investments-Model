The kitchen is fully supplied to cook anything you like (except groceries, of course). There is even a well-stocked spice rack. It is located in a historic neighborhood in Albany, with many interesting houses from the era of the turn of the 20th century. It is a short walk from the historic downtown, with many restaurants and interesting shops. It is also close to the Willamette River which has a walkway. Host Lee Anne was very available and accommodating."

Stayed a few nights","Lee Anne’s cottage was great! Super cute on the inside and had everything we needed for our weekend stay. She was kind enough to leave us a few goodies in the fridge upon arrival, and made sure to check in to make sure things were going well and that we didn’t have any issues. Her parking instructions and check in info was super straight forward and easy to follow. The cottage is within walking distance to downtown Albany, where we walked to get coffee and have breakfast. For being a “studio”, it felt like there was more than enough space, and we loved the fact that there was a washer and dryer. The kitchen and bathroom appliances were all new as well. I only wish it would have been warmer so we could enjoy the back porch area! Would definitely stay here again in the future!"

Perfect place to go when you don’t want to feel like you’re in the city, even though you are. We will definitely be coming back."

Stayed over a week","Lee Anne is a fantastic host. She is friendly and attentive. Easy to communicate with at all times. She provided us with a breakfast starter kit of homemade banana bread, yogurt, bottled water, coffee, tea, creamer and sugar. She has great suggestions of fun places to go and local things to do. The cottage is a short walk to downtown and many local parks. It has everything you could want and then some. Comfortable for 2 adults, it is clean and cozy. We love the 2 parking spaces(one big enough to fit our one ton truck) and spacious locked and fenced back porch where we were able to store 4 bikes and still have space for grilling lounging and eating outside. Towels are fluffy , water pressure is strong, there is the cutest tub I have ever seen, bed is comfortable and the internet is fast and consistent. The washer and dryer work well and quickly! Recommend the vine st. cottage for a short or long stay in Albany."

The kitchen has everything one needs if cooking at home is what guests prefer, but the cottage is a walking distance away from downtown with many restaurants and cafes.
The bedrooms are comfortable, cozy, and clean.

Stayed over a week","Beautiful Cottage, close to everything. I stayed a month and a half and loved every minute of my stay. The Cottage was clean, bright and well stocked for any type of cooking (incuding spices). Towels and bedding was luxurious, including the snuggly handmade quilts that I used often on the leather couch. The appliances were large capacity and worked well, including the full sized washer and dryer downstairs. Julie & Mike provided every comfort needed to stay a day or a month. Including hand soap, dish & dishwasher soap, lots of dishes, glasses w/wine glasses, silverware, pots/pans/cookie sheet/ blender, coffee pot and a full Humming Bird feeder for your bird watching. They also provide picnic items for having your lunch under the Grape Arbor. Festive lights on a timer make the magic come alive in the evening. I would highly recommend J&M's cottage for a romantic get-away or family trip to Albany Oregon."

Stayed a few nights","We were visiting friends in Albany, Oregon and were looking at hotels for lodging. The only choices were close to highway 5 which is noisy and would have been kind of spartan and commercial. We decided to look at AirBnB and were pleasantly surprised at what we found. There were two places listed for Albany and the listing of Julie and Mike stood out over the other place for several reasons. First of all it was a better deal because of their more reasonable cleaning fee. The other was the charm of the cottage and the privacy that it provided. Because we were able to park beside the house in its own driveway it felt more like we were part of the neighborhood rather than intruders.
Instructions for accessing the key were straightforward and easy and when we walked in it was such a beautiful little cottage with a fully functional kitchen, lots of suggestions for local restaurants and eateries, activities, places to visit, etc. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!"

When we arrived, AC and music was already on to welcome us. (there was a heat wave that weekend and the house was nice and cool!) Hosts provides some water and yogurt as a welcome gift. She also has a nice folder of recommendations. House is located in a very safe area but walls are thin and the neighbors rise early so no sleeping in if you are a light sleeper like me. Kitchen and Bedrooms were very clean. Bed is on the harder side but not uncomfortable. Very nice bedding and bath towels. Overall wonderful stay in Albany and we recommend this house to anyone!

The house is old but clean and in a safe neighborhood. As my wife said ""it's cute."" It had everything they needed and the beds were comfortable. When a can opener was broken, the hosts immediately bought a new one. When there were no wash cloths, the hosts immediately brought some over. They checked every day to make sure everything was A-OK. We will be happy to rent this house in the future for visiting guests. We recommend it to all. Thanks Julie and Mike."

Stayed a few nights","My co-worker and I ended up trying to go into the wrong door which was to the main house, but other than that little hiccup the whole experience was good. The room was comfortable and very clean. Loved the shower, but couldn't enjoy the tub with it being glass French doors into the living space and a co-worker vs significant other in the next room. I think couples and small families would love the space. Parking was interesting because we ended up parked in front of the neighbors house instead of the place we were staying as there were several vehicles parked on the street out front. It worked for us and we enjoyed out stay."

Stayed with kids","Sandra's place was super clean and perfect for a stay with our toddler.
There was a small hiccup trying to find the place since our navigation kept sending us to a different location that had the same street. We loved that a kitchen, bathroom, bathtub, backyard was available just for us. Our only suggestion will be for the owner to place some kind of shade or curtain on the kitchen window since you could see the owners kitchen window too, which ended up taking away some of the privacy. We had to put a small blanket up in order to feel more comfortable. Other than that, it was one of our favorite Airbnbs that we have stayed at, plus there are plenty of stores near if needed to do some quick shopping."

The house felt very comfortable, clean, and had everything we needed. All the beds were comfortable and the rooms were quite large. Perfect for a large group or family. We used the gas grill out back to cook some burgers and it was a nice area to relax and enjoy the weather. There were plenty of grocery stores nearby including a Costco as well as some great restaurants. Our favorites were Pop’s Branding Iron and Los Tequilas. The downtown shops were close however almost everything was closed on Sunday. We did get the chance to ride the carousel at the museum before it closed though.

All of the smaller kitchen appliances (toaster oven, toaster, blender, coffee maker) were new and worked well. Four bedrooms with room for 9 to sleep on the second floor were simply furnished, clean and comfortable. The house is close to the I-5 which is convenient but a bit loud when the windows are open."

Group trip","Our group of nine women pushed the limits of the sleeping accommodations—especially since none of us wanted to share a bed. But we got by just fine. Several of us brought sleeping bags and pads. (All of us are members of an outdoor club so are accustomed to camping out.)
One gal set up her tent in the back yard, another slept in her portable reclining patio chair on the back deck. We used the cot provided at the house, and I brought an additional cot and pad for myself, which I set up in the Master bedroom.
Everyone loved the spaciousness and cleanliness of the house. The backyard and deck are lovely. Several people brought camp chairs to use outside (per my suggestion since there are only two chairs on the deck), and we found it very pleasant indeed, to sit outside.
There were so many choices of nice places to gather and visit and share snacks both inside and outside the house. At the same time the bedrooms upstairs provided quiet space for anyone who wanted to drop out and rest. It was ideal for our group.
We were very pleased to find that there are three bathrooms: A half bath downstairs in addition to the two full bathrooms on the second floor.
Several people chose to walk to and from the Hot Air Balloon Festival, rather than deal with the crowded parking lots near Timber Linn Park. Having the Festival venue within walking distance was a definite plus for us.
If we decide to do the Balloon Festival again next year, we will definitely want to rent Henk’s house!"

We were warned by Mary that because this was the basement, we would hear people from upstairs. We were fine with it. We did have an issue, with a different family checking in upstairs, on our last night there. It sounded like the kids were gonna fall through the ceiling and land in our laps from jumping 😂 No big deal though. We just knocked on the front door and politely asked them to keep it down. The family was really nice and apologized.
We would definitely stay there again. 😊"

Depending on traffic, it is a 20-30 minute drive but easy to navigate. Mary's place was clean and well appointed. There are just two things to be aware of, which are that it is below another unit and noise from upstairs is very audible, and the ceilings are very low. I am only 6' 1"" but I hit my head a few times not being used to the low ceilings and door jams. Overall, we enjoyed our stay."

Stayed with kids","Wow. This is probably the cleanest AirBNB I’ve stayed in. Great and easy to access location. We stopped in Albany purely because of where it was on our road trip route but it turned out to be an adorable little town that reminded me a whole lot of the little Nebraska town I grew up in. The downtown was great and we had breakfast at Margin Coffee Roasters, which was incredible. Can’t say I had high expectations for Albany, but I know Ill be back in the future and have a great place to stay! We did have some issues with noise but in fairness, I didn’t notify the hosts until the next day and I don’t think that the other guests were doing anything usual, it’s just that I’m a very light sleeper. That said, the response from Mary was very helpful and I greatly appreciate her attitude. Thank you for a delightful stay! I hope we can stay longer next time :)"

The host said no pets had stayed there recently, but that didn’t change the fact that it smelled like cat & the odor wasn’t easy to get used to. One bed was good, the other too soft/uncomfortable. There are just enough dishes to get by for one meal, so if you are staying for more than one night you’ll be washing dishes between meals."

Stayed over a week","Pots and pans are greasy, kitchen towels are raged and stained. Grey bathroom rugs were dirty.
House was always cold, never really warmed up.
Basement unit not well insulated and can hear all noise from upstairs. The pool table noise and the party atmosphere is not conducive for the basement renters at ALL. Quiet hours do not mean quiet hours. I had to call the police twice to get the noise settled down.
Not enought blankets for the beds.
Kitchen stove is really dirty and the pans are awkward to use.
So many decorations on all tables not able to use the space well.
I would never rent from this host again."

Because of it being in the basement, we did hear all the movements from the people upstairs. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars was because of the heating. The thermostat is controlled by the people upstairs or remotely. Mary did tell me however, that it is a new heating/cooling unit and she realized that there were a few kinks to work out. All in all, our stay was wonderful, and I would recommend to my friends."

Audra and I are new lovers who met up in Albany and stayed in the home for two wonderful nights together. We both commented on how we could live as nice at home and now someday we probably will buy a historical home in Albany and settle down there and grow old together. It had a very homely feel that was incredibly comfortable for us. It's likely you'll be seeing my name again as we will probably make renting this property a regular thing for us as we continue to grow this incredible love we've found with one another.

There's a washer and dryer in the unit which I found very useful. The place was very clean and neat and is definitely such a cute spot. Mary and her partners were amazing at communicating throughout the whole stay. They checked in with me the next day to see if everything was going well, and if I had any questions, they would respond right away.
Everything was pleasant! If you get see the chance to stay here, you should take it! It's a cute little place and the ladies are amazing as well."

Stayed a few nights","It’s a (brand new & renovated) basement appartement, very nice decorated with two comfy king beds. Basically all is available, with a nice kitchen en bathroom. The house itself is about 100 years old and looks amazing. As it’s a basement appartement the ceilings are rather low so be carefull :).
I give 3 stars for 2 main reasons; first of all because the upper house and the level of noise. We were very lucky that there were just two older guests staying upstairs instead of e.g. 6 people, but even then, it’s very noisy and you can hear basically everything. Just to keep in mind. Second, suddenly the air conditioning downstairs started to blow strongly, and it seems thats connected/controlled by the upper house. This is something that really should be divided in one way or another. Further, and just a note, and not sure if that was mentioned in the info, they ask for a parking fee for the big driveway, or else, ask you to park 15 feet away (which is free). It’s not about the money itself, but why ask for a fee and don’t offer that as a service as there is plenty of space, both on the driveway and on the street.
If the upper house is empty, I would go again, if not, I would hesitate."

My two grandkids were with us and the house had a bedroom with two beds and even some toys for the kids to play with. The house was very close to Corvallis which was perfect since that's where we spent most of our time. Everything was exactly as advertised. We'd stay at Brandon's place again in a heartbeat!

Stayed over a week","Fantastic Apartment
Exactly as pictured. The apartment is detached from the home. The entrance and windows face out on a pasture. You are given total privacy. Designated parking spot. Lots of thoughtful touches and great facilities: Keurig cups, oatmeal, breakfast bars, spice rack, very comfortable bed, grill, outdoor table with chairs on porch, excellent washer and dryer, great shower. I stayed for a month until I found an apartment but literally wanted to use this Airbnb as my apartment. Great example of efficiently using space.
Location is so convenient if you are visiting OSU. Great for parents coming to visit a student. Can have your son/daughter over for a home cooked meal and do their laundry!

Best Airbnb I’ve stayed at."

Stayed a few nights","This stay was absolutely perfect! I loved this guesthouse. I stayed for a few days to visit my student at OSU. Heather was perfectly communicative and was very helpful when I thought I'd booked three nights but had only booked two (oops). Her flexibility was much appreciated.
The coffee game was high with a frother! Two percent was perfect for the frother.
The place was plenty roomy for my daughter and I and it was very clean.
Your view looks across farmland and provided a nice relief from the craziness of downtown..
The washer and dryer came in handy for muddy knees.
The place is conveniently located less than 10 minutes from Corvallis and faces away from the main house, so it is private and peaceful. She'll have the string lights on for your arrival, making it very festive.
The kitchen is very well-supplied with instant pot, pots, slow cooker, mixer. Plenty of servingware."

It is perfectly equipped and had everything my heart desired: a generously furnished kitchen (with sharp knives, a mixer, blender, crockpot and, best of all, a generous spice rack), a comfy bed and a comfy couch. It also offers a good workplace with an ergonomic chair and reliable, fast WiFi.
Heather was quick to respond to any questions we had and helped us wherever she could.
I will definitely be staying here again if and when I return to Corvallis."

Stayed over a week","Fantastic place to stay! I spent a month here and loved it. The hosts are a super nice young couple with two adorable kids.
The rental is in their backyard, close to their house, but you never hear a thing from them! The whole setup is very private, including your own separate parking space. A motion detector turns on lights for you as you head down the path from your car to the cottage.
Perfect for safety conscious solo travelers, nice and secure. Safe privacy.
This is between Albany and Corvallis, but closer to Corvallis. Less than ten minutes to downtown, less than 15 to campus. Easy access to go to games or other OSU events.
The kitchen is very well supplied. I loved the frother on the Keurig, had never used one of those, made lattes most days, and they provide a huge spice rack loaded with flavors. The kitchen is def complete.
Bed is comfortable and, again, nice and quiet.
The shower/bathroom is very nice, as well. They did a great job with the remodel.
And oh yeah, the front porch! Loved it. Great place to sit and chill in your private space. Yes, this is a nice setup.
Would absolutely stay here again, probably will!"

Stayed over a week","Heather is amazing. The experience was so good, I’m not sure where to start.
I stayed at the guesthouse with my girlfriend for about a month. I had never stayed at an Airbnb that long so I was a bit nervous, but all that disappeared once we met her and stepped foot in the place. It was stylish, clean (like whoa), and the most of all well thought out. Privacy? Check. Kitchen with a range? Check. Washer & dryer? Check. I mean it was like living in a fully furnished tiny home with all the amenities we could think of. Heather asked us even before we arrived, if there’s anything we’d like set up. She followed up several times making sure our stay was comfortable, always letting us know ahead of time when things might become noisy (yard work etc). It never became that loud, but we appreciated the excellent communication.
The bonus for us was the view. The front porch faces a very large open field, and we’d frequently see neighboring cows hang out, grazing on the grass. They were super friendly and curious. Having lived most of my life in the cities, the countryside was so refreshing that I often sat there with a cup of tea just looking out. And even though the guesthouse is located close to the nature, it is only 10 minutes away from a vibrant college town with local restaurants, shopping, etc.
If you’re interested in experiencing peace and quiet while having access to cities, this is THE place. We can’t recommended it enough!"

Stayed over a week","This house was perfect for us! And Heather was the perfect host! My wife and I stayed here for two weeks so that we could quarantine before visiting my mother (who is immunocompromised) for Christmas. Heather contacted us before our stay to make sure the place was stocked with everything we'd need, even asking us what kinds of K-cups and shower toiletries we prefer. She bought a spice rack so that we would have spices to cook with. When we arrived, we were surprised and deeply touched by the holiday decorations they put up for us, including a Christmas tree on the porch, lights, a wreath, and two stockings with our names on them. This definitely put us in the Christmas spirit! We felt so welcome here. Everything inside also reflected Heather's personal touch, from holiday mugs to popcorn and snacks for us. The decor is modern yet warm. All of the appliances are up-to-date and worked great. The wifi was strong enough for my wife and I to have simultaneous Zoom work meetings. We enjoyed watching Netflix on the large TV. We could not have asked for a better place to stay these two weeks and we consider ourselves so lucky to have found the Stay at the Riverside Guesthouse. We are very grateful for their generosity and hospitality! Very highly recommended!"

We enjoyed everything the house had to offer; from the beautiful front porch sitting, to all the extremely comfortable bedding throughout each room. We were also able to enjoy lots of sunshine in the backyard and played lots of basketball in the driveway 🙂 loved staying here and would definitely stay again in the future, if the opportunity arose 😉"

Stayed with kids","I have been using Airbnb as a guest for several years, all over the world, and I have never experienced such generous hospitality as we felt this past week at Joyce's gorgeous home. Sadly, the reason for our trip was the heartbreaking funeral of a dear family member. So Joyce, knowing this, went grocery shopping for us, so that when we arrived the kitchen was stocked with granola, fruit, chocolates, snacks, and coffee, etc. It was such a touching gesture, we were all very grateful. The house is so lovely, the living room is so cozy with the wood burning stove and comfy sofas. The kitchen is exceptionally well stocked. The bedrooms are beautiful, and the beds so comfy. On the morning of the funeral, we woke up to snow, so stepping out onto that fabulous front porch to see the small canal out front of the house, under snow covered trees, with the little ducks happily swimming... well, it just seemed like something out of a fairy tale. We are super grateful for Joyce's kindness."

Group trip","I don't know where to start! The Hewitt House is simply amazing. A couple members of our party were raised in craftsman house's so it brought back some great memories for them. The small canal in the front with ducks was charming. The location was superb, 4-5 blocks, to everything you would want to do in Historic Downtown Albany. There is plenty of parking at the house, so leave the cars at home and walk. Although, if it's a challenge for you to walk, parking was never an issue downtown. We were fortunate to come on the weekend of the Antique & Car Show, plus there were a plethora of garage sales! If you enjoy wine, I suggest you book a wine tasting at the Willamette Valley Winery. Simply fascinating & divine! Joyce and her team work hard to provide not only a beautiful place to stay but a clean & comfortable one as well. Bravo Joyce, Bravo!"

Stayed a few nights","An old home in a quiet, old neighbourhood. When you climb the eight steps to the front door, you are subjected to a pile of the neighbor's junk immediately to your left. Ugh.
Fortunately, while sitting on the rocking chairs or the swing chair on the front porch, the junk pile is not visible.
We slept well in the room with a king size bed. Each bedroom has it's own air conditioner. It's a quiet area at night. Close enough to downtown to easily walk there.
The interior of the main living space is dark, walls are painted in dark blue with dark wood trim and wood floors. However, there are two large windows which add light.
The squeaky wood floors throughout the house are either quaint or annoying. And the mish-mash of eating utensils in the kitchen, all of poor quality, need to be upgraded.
If you have not read the section in the listing described as ""hosted by Joyce"" be sure to do so. It is there you will find that there is a person living in the home. Sera lives downstairs, described as an ""attached apartment"". We met her twice in our five night stay, she was very friendly. In fact, she was helpful in resolving a nuisance light on the exterior of the house, next to the bedroom window, which comes on at dusk and off at dawn. A very bright light which made sleep difficult. Sera and Joyce were unable to turn off the light. But Sera did adjust the setting to turn on with motion sensor.
The home is listed as ""waterfront"". There is a small, concrete canal in front of the house, about eight feet wide and a foot deep. I don't call that waterfront."

All of the rooms were nicely appointed with towels in baskets ready for use. The kitchen had all necessary appliances and accessories that made food prep a breeze.
Sera and Joyce were always timely in response to any inquiries.
Although we didn't get to tour Albany, we did take time to take a spin on the beautiful carousel and visit Midway Farm.
Thank you Joyce and Sera for making our first trip to Oregon comfortable and memorable."

The home was clean and neat. Each room was decorated nicely and the beds had ample pillows and nice sheets. ((in many air bb the quality of sheets and towels are lacking)). Additionally each room had a basket of towels which were high quality.
The kitchen was stocked with all the dishes and cups we needed. The breakfast nook was a great spot to have our morning oatmeal pre race.
The front porch was the perfect spot to have our morning coffee/tea or just relax in the evening. The stream across the street was soothing and was perfect to add to the serenity. We met a few neighbors who were so friendly!
Overall our stay was perfect and I'd highly recommend the home. Joyce was a pleasure to work with as well, very communicative!"

We missed a few of the first days we were supposed to stay due to icy roads and snow, Lori actually extended our stay a few extra days at no additional cost. Great host, great place."

It’s in a quiet neighborhood and is so very comfortable with all the essentials (& extras!) provided. Lori is a marvelous host, and was able to extend our stay by a couple days for us…thank goodness no one else had booked those mid-week days! We book early to try to guarantee our annual visit. I can’t imagine anyone not being charmed by this lovely Carriage House!"

We live relatively close to downtown Albany but we were attending a work party at Camille’s(also amazing btw) and we always want to be safe but we also love the comfort of our own home so finding this place was a score. Lori was so quick to respond to my questions and to approve the booking once we chatted. It was super easy to find and walking distance from allll of the shops and restaurants toward the river. We walked in and immediately felt at home it was warm and quiet, so clean and so so cozy. I almost didn’t want to leave. I will definitely be recommending to family and friends when they are visiting!"

Just as important, Lori has a very private backyard which was a very nice feature to return to everyday.
She was very helpful, offering recommendations for our day trip to the coast, which is about an hour from her home and I highly recommend you visit.
She also offered great recommendations for local vineyards, Willamette Valley Vineyards is a must.
We were able to chat with Lori, and she was very nice and friendly.
Lori has really done a great job as a host, offering water and snacks and coffee to go cups, thinking of everything.
Her home is a great value and I highly recommend a stay there."

It's all the little, thoughtful touches that stand out too; like a toothbrush and tooth paste, yummy snacks, coffee and even a phone charger. I had forgotten to bring mine and was elated to find a charger on the bedside nightstand. Lori is super friendly, thoughtful and very responsive. The place was cool upon my arrival (she had turned on the air conditioner) and much appreciated after a long hot day of driving.
Lori is pretty much the perfect hostess and her carriage house is hands down the best Airbnb I've stayed at. I highly recommend her place and would definitely stay again. It's truly a home away from home.

Stayed a few nights","I adore this guest house and the family who owns it and lives next door. It is a great, peaceful, and slow paced neighborhood in walking distance to the old downtown and river.
If you are sensitive to noise, like me, you may want a noise machine overnight because the train horns can be heard from a couple miles away.
I chose Lori’s place by chance, and then discovered after arrival that her family has known my in laws in town for 60 years. I was able to reintroduce them and it was a hoot! Discovered in the process that they are fellow people of faith. ;)
One the the appliances had a minor glitch, but Lori already had instructions and back-up appliances on hand. She was immediately responsive and offered to go to great lengths to repair the main appliance. We kept in touch and it was repaired at a convenient time.
I would love to stay here again! Thank you Lori and family!"

Stayed a few nights","We had a wonderful stay at the Carriage House! The neighborhood is quiet and a quick walk to the historic downtown (If you like antiques don’t miss the Albany Antique Mall - fabulous!). We loved strolling around to check out the beautiful historic homes in the neighborhood - be sure to look for the duck “parklet” a block away…utterly charming.
Lori is a great hostess; fast to reply, check-in super easy, and the house was spotless. It was spacious, nicely decorated and comfortable. She provided everything we needed (including some thoughtful snacks) and we loved the cute private backyard to sit outside under the lights with a glass of wine.
One of the nicest of many stays we’ve had in the area when visiting our daughter at OSU - we look forward to returning!"

Also loved the Keurig with coffee pods so I could make it out quick to work in the morning. Check in and check out instructions were clear and not at all cumbersome. The location was ideal if you are looking to be close to shops and restaurants in Albany. I will happily book again for my next trip there!

Other than the small details, the place was just beautiful and so comfortable! The place is absolutely gorgeous, and there’s a beautiful outside patio area! I had such a great stay and would stay there again if I could.

We stay here every time we are there - which is 2x a year over the last 5 years.
When you arrive, there are a few snacks, water and coffee so you don’t have to go to the store right away if you don’t have time.
The kitchen has everything needed to cook and bake.
The full size washer and dryer are great when you need to do laundry- pods and dryer sheets are there for your use.
Our favorite part is the private backyard. We sit out every morning and afternoon and enjoy the beautifully landscaped space.
Communication is great and timely."

Stayed a few nights","This was a lovely find. Melanie was extremely communicative and provided all of the necessary instructions. Clean up/check out was easy (she asks that used towels go in the bathtub, that the trash is taken out/liners replaced, dishwasher is started). The kitchen had everything we needed and more; bathroom also was well-stocked. Home was super cute and very clean. Items were labeled and easy to find. Shared laundry (via a locked door) with the other unit; those tenants were quiet but also very nice when I left them a note with a “will we disturb you if we run a load of laundry later tonight” message…much appreciated their kind response. All in all: easy to find, clean, very cute, comfortable, safe and clean neighborhood. Note that the house does front what seemed like it may be a busy neighborhood road but it was quiet and I didn’t notice traffic at all! I would recommend this home and this host without reservation. Thank you!"

Stayed with kids","Melanie’s places is beautiful and really clean. The only thing to pay attention is the train is really noisy at night time and you can easily wake up due to that a few times, but this is not something related to the house. Finally if you are looking to use the laundry the internal home direction says that the laundry room is not shared. So they give you some options for you to a few blocks away."

Got to meet the ajoining neighbors the first night after they set off the smoke alarms cooking. Made me feel like I was back home with the wife, lol. The last night we met with another set of neighbors as we were both doing laundry in the ajoined space. Was a good experience"

The updated cottage was clean and well stocked. There was an impressive level of amenities. The kitchen was not only modern and well equipped but also filled with essentials that made cooking and dining in a pleasure.
We felt comfortable a soon as we walked in. It truly felt like our home away from home. We hope to be back!"

Stayed over a week","The location is quite convenient to commute to Corvallis. Albany and Corvallis have quite a bit to offer. I had very good eating and shopping experiences in both towns.
Oregon is cold for me, but the main heating unit is heating well. And there's a few small space heaters, & plenty of throws around the house.
All the bedding are warm and comfortable.
I had good nights' sleep.
Kitchen has enough pots, pans & utensils (also a small rice cooker) to do a simple full meal. I was able to cook my son his favorite pork ribs.
I think there was a mistake on the instruction inside the house on the laundry room. Melanie was VERY quick to respond. But I totally forgot to tell her what was on the instruction in the folder. Everything worked out in the end :)
I really like the local for the quiet and very home like feel. It certainly was a very good comfortable relaxing feeling whenever I get back to the house after a day's out.
I would be back when I'm going to Albany again."

Stayed with kids",Melanie was a responsive host. I did encounter some confusion about the washer and dryer. The sign on the door to the laundry room said emergency exit only. So I was confused when that door was needed to get to the laundry room. It’s a shared facility and can be inconvenient if you need to wash on a specific day because (when I stayed there) you’re only allowed to use it on certain days during the week. I ran into an issue where the spare bedroom window lock was broken and I was unable to get it locked. So I stayed awake all night because my kid was staying in that room and I didn’t feel safe. The host said she would have it repaired the following day and it may have been but I didn’t feel safe staying there and left and cancelled the reservation. Everything stater in the listing was accurate.

The A/C was great and especially worked will during some 105 degree weather!!! It's a great location too- close to the Carousel and also a fun park down the road. We will definitely be coming back!!"

Stayed a few nights","Home was sparkling clean and stocked with plenty of towels and extra linens for the cold. There is no shortage of blankets! The beds were so comfortable and there are plenty of pillows. The heater ""Berta"" is in the heart of the living room. Her ability to warm the home should not be underestimated- she will keep the house and the other rooms warm against the cold. The water heater is enough for multiple short showers, but not advised for baths. We loved that there were plenty of amenities in the kitchen, like the keurig and baking pans which we used for breakfast. The wifi is good enough to support a gamer, a student, and a researcher using it at the same time, given nobody is downloading a massive game. Overall, my family and I enjoyed a wonderful day to rest, do online work, and relax here in between driving."

Stayed about a week","Being from Canada i was a little worried about getting around but the location of Melindas place was very close to everything you need with a little convenience store just steps away, Albany is a cute little town and I had an amazing time there. She provided all the amenities that you would need and also had a little private backyard which was nice to sit and enjoy a coffee in the morning. I was able to park in the driveway all week it is a tight space but would fit a small car easily. I would most definitely go back to Melindas cottage in a heartbeat. Thank you for your hospitality Melinda!"

Stayed about a week","This was my fourth stay in five months at Talbert House, and this time my husband joined me. We were very comfortable, and he felt right at home as much as I did. It was rainy and cold the entire week, but we were warm and cozy in the cottage.
We cooked more than I had done on past trips, as we had driven and had room to bring more than when I had flown. We found Melinda's kitchen had everything we needed, along with extras - Melinda even left a gift for us!
Melinda is a perfect host. She communicates warmly and promptly, but gives us our space as well. Truly a wonderful rental."

Stayed over a week","Because of a family emergency, I needed to come several days early for an already scheduled trip. Melinda responded quickly to my message and accommodated my additional dates. The cottage was a refuge after exhausting and stressful days. Also, Melinda had had the heating unit serviced since my last trip and it worked well. I used the office for a number of video meetings, and the internet was great. The well-equipped kitchen was great. Also, the lighting is terrific, with can lights in the living room, kitchen and bathrooms and lamps throughout the house. I used the washer/dryer for the first time, and it worked well (Melinda even provides detergent).
Throughout my stay, Melinda responded to any questions promptly, and checked in to see how I was doing from time to time. I can't recommend her cottage enough."

I was very grateful to have a washer and dryer for my week’s stay. The living room was very cozy and warm and so nice to curl up with a good movie at night. The location was easy to find, and my big SUV fit perfectly in the assigned parking spot. The highlight was the tokens Melinda left for me to take my niece on the Merry Go’Round for special memories at Thanksgiving. I would definitely recommend and will be back! Thanks again for your generous hospitality!"

Stayed about a week","I enjoyed my second week-long stay at Talbert House. In addition to what I wrote before, I'll mention that the bed is very comfortable and the bathrooms are remodeled nicely (as is the entire cottage). Melinda provides shampoo, conditioner and body wash in the two showers, as well as plenty of paper products. The kitchen appliances all work well. Everything is very clean. I learned that there is a wall heater in the main bathroom that warms the area. The main heating/cooling unit in the living room tries hard to heat the house, but the weather was cold during this stay (below freezing outside), and it had some trouble keeping up. But I was fine wrapping up in the plentiful throws and blankets.
Melinda is an excellent host, and communicates quickly and warmly. She provides all sorts of extra touches that make the cottage seem like a home away from home, and I very much enjoyed my stay. I look forward to my next stay in November."

Stayed about a week","I can't say enough good things about Talbert House. Melinda has remodeled this 1922 cottage with all the modern conveniences. It is spotlessly clean. The furniture is comfortable and attractive. The kitchen is well equipped, including three kinds of coffee makers (and provided coffee and teas). She could be a designer, with all the little touches throughout the house that were beautiful and functional. The TV worked well, with streaming capabilities.
She asks that shoes not be worn in the bedroom, so I'll bring slippers next time. The neighborhood is a few blocks further east from downtown than the airbnb map shows, but I felt safe. I found it easy to park on the street in front of the house, although there is a narrow driveway. A heater/air-conditioner mounted on the wall of the living room provided adequate heat, and Melinda provided many throws and extra blankets if needed. She also has books and games available.
This was a perfect haven. I already have two more trips booked!"

It looks like she kept the original floors, glass doorknobs, push button light switches, plaster walls, and then added up to date furnishings along with a modern kitchen. Her home is neat, clean and comfortable with cozy throws, pillows, travel information, cookbooks, everything you may need for a visit to Albany. The private office would be great for someone working remotely. Thank you for a wonderful stay - we will definitely request to stay here again when we come back to visit family in Oregon."

The kitchen is beautiful and fully stocked; you can cook or bake as much as you desire. Also, a lovely bottle of Oregon vino was set out for us to enjoy (thank you, Melinda!)
We also took advantage of the large, private backyard and enjoyed our morning coffee on the patio each day.
The house is located in the historic district of town and is within walking distance to many shops and restaurants, which is very convenient. The only (mild) downside is the street in front of the house. It’s a busy street and can be a little loud at times. Overall, it was an exceptional stay. We would definitely come back!"
