Stayed with a pet","This place is absolutely adorable! Very quaint and unique space, wonderful woodwork and local art inside. They have all the amenities you need, it was very clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. We loved the outdoor sitting area! It is conveniently located right behind the library and walkable to Grocery Outlet and a few restaurants. The hosts were amazing - very responsive and accommodating. This is truly a great find in an up and coming town. We have driven through, but never stayed, in Susanville many times, however, after this stay we will definitely stay here again!"

Stayed with a pet","Literally a port in the storm. Quincy (the mayor of Susanville!) was extremely welcoming. Helped dig snow out of the parking space and made sure we were settled after a long drive. It was convenient to have a comfortable place for the dogs.
Don’t plan to do any complicated food preparation — it’s a very limited set up. Bed is up against the wall, which may be inconvenient for anyone with limited mobility. Overall, very glad we stayed there."

We really loved the front deck and spent a lot of time there listening to the birds. Quincy gave very detailed instructions to find the place, which we definitely needed. It’s pretty tucked away behind the library. Parking was just ok for our sedan. Might be a tight spot for someone with a big truck or SUV."

Stayed with a pet","The lication was tricky, but basically its behind grocery outlet. I wish that was more clear without the instructions. Great porch. The location Was near A cool baseball field, community garden and aponsored river restoration walking path. The living room bed is HarD as a rock, but the bedroom bed is better. How to use the cooktop- not clear and no instructions. I did appreciate the stay, but for the price there is a bit of spiffing up. Its very quirky and squeaky floored, but I did like the rustic peacefulness and privacy. I think its a good fit for my needs. Also my dog liked it."

A small smart tv would have been nice because I am very low tech and didn't attempt to run the hdmi projector. The bbq area on the front porch is a comfortable place for meals and the grill is a very nice one. Thanks to Quincy for a great place to stay.

Stayed a few nights","The host is very responsive, though he did point out my issues were things anyone else had mentioned. Like smelling cooking ealry in the morning.
I can only speak from my personal opinion, the flat is exceptionally clean. The decor is pleasant. I personally did not find it comfortable. It was too dark for me. The futon was the only place to sit which comfy at all, with the exception of table which had also two uncomfortable chairs. I found myself not wanting to be there after work. Quincy did try to meet my personal needs, though I was felt a bit awkward by his responses. I asked if there were other pillows and a lightweight blanket( middle of the summer so the heavy comforter was way too hot for me) Anyway…. This is just personal taste. There was nothing “bad” about this place, just not my personal cup of tea."

A 3-minute walk took us to Bing’s, a Japanese restaurant, where we had a great dinner of yakisoba noodles and tonkatsu ramen. They also offer good sushi. This and other nearby restaurants, services, parks and sightseeing opportunities are listed on a white board in the house; very helpful! After dinner, we enjoyed a quiet evening on the front porch, then got an excellent night’s sleep. Looking forward to a return visit!"

The little details and decor in the space are just beautiful. The floor is REAL wood and that comes with squeaks, so if you have light sleepers with you keep that in mind before you traipse off to the bathroom around midnight. 😂"

Quincy was super quick in responses and catered to all our needs. Place is exactly as described. Squeaky floors is my only little complaint.

Only thing i’ll note is that when you use Airbnb’s get directions feature, it takes you to the opposite side of town from the house. Just map to the business they mention in the instructions and then follow those from there."

Group trip","This place is absolutely stunning. We arrived to a Winter wonderland by way of a nice, long driveway away from the road.
The driveway is one property over from where our GPS tried us to pull over, but the thorough description that the hosts provided made it easy to find regardless.
The cabin is cozy and has bedrooms with beautiful views. The corner bedroom was a special treat, with stunning views of the pond. It's a perfect getaway kind of place. The peaceful property and comfortable cabin just makes you wanna stay for a while. Unfortunately we only had one night.
Thanks to overnight snow, we had a hard time getting out of the driveway the next morning. I texted John and he had it plowed within an hour.
I would give 6 out of 5 stars if I could and hope to return here one day, just to relax rather than just coming through."

Of year. It was a perfect winter wonderland.

My favorite so much I wish I lived there all the time.
Close to town. Beautiful remodeled too, add another bathroom and bedroom but still kept the outdoor aura cabin feel.
The kids will love the snow and in the summer they will love the creek and pond.
Thanks as always

The home provides multiple seating areas and a well-stocked kitchen. The air conditioning was a definite plus considering the unusual heat wave of over 100. We were pleasantly surprised by the s’mores supplies. It is a short drive into town. We will definitely stay here again!"

Nestled in the woods, on a creek with a pond a small streams, we enjoyed sitting on the swings by the fire pit, in the hammock by the creek and in our chairs in the creek. It was a lovely respite from the 100 degree plus heat at home. The kids loved the zip line. The host was very responsive to a small wifi issue but once fixed the internet was amazingly fast for such a mountainous location. Work from home? No! work from the cottage!"

Doing dishes could never be more enjoyable with an open window watching and hear the water flow. Driving through Susanville we were shocked that this place existed. The home was comfortable and these hosts truly understand hospitality providing high quality coffee among many other things. Highly recommended! A++++++++

Out of the city but close enough to order a pizza or go get dinner somewhere. The creek runs right next to the place and adds an incredible sense of serenity. We can’t wait to book again! The amazing local wildlife photography they decorated with from randy robins photography enhances your sense of the habitat you’re staying in and somehow makes it even more exciting to stay there. Highly recommend! As with any mountains, cell reception can be spotty at times but the WiFi worked great. If you’re looking for a great outdoor adventure destination with great trails within driving distance as well as an 18 hole golf course with amazing views of the mountains, this place will do the trick. The hosts were also very quick to answer any questions we had. Very well decorated and accommodations were very thoughtful. I’d put 6 stars if I could."

The property has amazing hills for sledding and a zip line for the kids. The fire was so easy to use and kept the place so cozy warm. The kids loved the bunk bed and the layout of the house was perfect. I felt close to the kids but also could find privacy. The property is very private! The long driveway makes you feel you are going somewhere special and is perfect for walking the dog in the morning. There is a creek and pond and I bet it would be wonderful in the spring or summer. If you are looking to take the kids to the snow for a few days to sled and play on your own private paradise this place is it!"

There were a few hiccups with the pellet stove not lighting correctly and the pilot was out on the hot water tank when we arrived but the hosts were super communicative and available. Definitely would stay again with our family. Beautiful grounds too! Do your research on outdoor activities before you go!

Stayed a few nights","My girlfriend and I stayed in the cottage and we were both pleasantly surprised at how secluded the place feels, even though it is just minutes from town. The space is dog friendly which allowed us to bring our two dogs with us - they loved being able to run around freely in the snow! With it being so cold out during our visit, we were worried it might get unbearably chilly while we slept, but the cottage has heating and it stayed cozy throughout our stay! The hosts had great communication and notified us when the wifi went down, which was a bit of a bummer but it really allowed us to unplug for the weekend and enjoy the views and relaxing sounds of the creek that runs through the property. We can say so many great things about this place. It really is a rare find! We would definitely stay again."

Cute place with a bit of a funky layout, but it proved to be comfortable for our family of three plus doggo. Kitchen is well equipped, everything you need to make a meal (and I cook a lot!) including herbs, spices and condiments. Jon & Lisa were kind enough to leave hot chocolate packets and cookies! Just wish the pellet stove had been hooked up when we were there, looks like it's just being installed. Thanks so much!"

Our favorite thing to do was sitting on the couch, get a hot cocoa pick a movie and chill on the couch and looking at the beautiful view outside while our dog was laying by the fireplace, so cute! Stayed during a snow storm on my honeymoon and absolutely loved it here! Lisa and Jon went above and beyond and even had a special gift delivered to us which was very thoughtful. Will definitely stay again. Plus, we got there earlier than expected and then let us do the check in. We really appreciate that!
We had our dog with us and she had a blast! Thank you so much guys! We had the best stay!"

The property is so so pretty and the main bedroom is so spacious we kept our little one and his crib in there with us.

Cottage is our families peaceful, serenity. It’s not only our go to place to spend quality time with our family and grandson. Each area of this property has special meaning. The deck is our hangout to catch up, the pond our dog uses as his own swimming pool the whole time. The strolls around the property and to the bridge are just a stunning piece of nature. You feel alone in the wilderness, with the calmness, with these, you are able to refuel and relax. Have a renewed sense when leaving.
The deer love the apples off the back tree. The turkeys out and about early.
The cottage has an amazing bed InThe master suite. Love it. Plenty of room for family members thought the house.

Had a very comfortable stay and enjoyed cooking out on the grill. House is cooled by a swamp cooler which, even in the high August temps, cooled the house amazingly. The only discrepancy between the listing and our experience was that the pond was empty at the time of our visit. We so enjoyed our two nights and recommend this location!"

There’s a small creek that runs through the property that is beautiful, lots of deer, and wild turkey on the property as well. The Cottage is very spacious and has everything you will need for your stay. Grocery stores are about 5 miles away, there’s a little family owned smokehouse that you pass on the way to the cabin that was excellent, I believe it was called GL&L Smokehouse. We picked up a tri tip and some bacon!
We had a great relaxing couple of days, would definitely stay again!"

When they arrived there was a huge bouquet of Happy Birthday balloons on the table and message on the white board. Our daughter was SO surprised and excited from the moment they arrived!! Her favorite color is green so she ran straight to the green room and claimed it as her bedroom for the weekend!
No buck harvested but they saw 39 doe, hiked through beautiful territory, live music at pizza, played foosball and checkers at a local bbq and had the very best daddy daughter trip! Thank you Mindy for creating such a beautiful experience for my husband and daughter!!!"

There was no street noise at night or during the day for that matter. The deer family that hung out in the yard were a nice surprise."

Stayed about a week","A MUST BOOK IF IN THE AREA!
As a fellow Airbnb host myself, I appreciated all that Mindy has put into this place. I have so much to say about how amazing this place is, but I am not sure I can do it justice! I was in town for work and it sure was a great place to ""come home"" to.
-Very clean home, with lots of unique accents.
-Kitchen is well stocked
-Included coffee was a bonus!
-Close to everything you would ever need. Walmart, Fast food, pizza, Rite Aid, etc all within 1.5-2 miles.
-Quiet Neighborhood, which was wonderful because I was in the area working night shift.
-Has old school charm, but is newly renovated.
-Comfortable seating.
-Firm and comfy mattresses. Bedding was great! And lots of different pillow options to suit your liking
- I enjoyed sitting on the back deck and watching the birds. While this home is in a neighborhood, there was still a ton of quail, hummingbirds, and the occasional Hawk that visited.
-Wifi is fast, I was able to work some during the day without issues
-Check in was a breeze!
Mindy was very responsive and so kind."

Stayed about a week","We had a wonderful stay at Mindy’s place. It was a harrowing experience we were going through with the Dixie Fire, but having an Airbnb really helped settle our nerves somewhat. We had to be evacuated for almost three weeks. We had my 98 year old dad with us, so staying in a shelter or hotel would not have worked for us. Luckily, as the sirens were going off and the firemen were going door to door to get people out, we found Mindy’s place on Airbnb!!! It’s in a great location and was just right for the three of us. We’re thankful for being able to return home and find our homes are still standing. Many of our friends weren’t so lucky. Mindy checked on us regularly to make sure we were ok and to see if we needed anything. She’s a great host!"

Stayed a few nights","As evacuees from the horrendous Dixie fire in CA, words cannot accurately describe how wonderful it has been to be able to stay in this cute, comfortable AirBnB home. We have my 98 year old father with us and we needed to be sure this evacuation was the least disruptive to his life as possible. (Ours, too!) So far, so good, due to the fact that there is a recliner for him to chill out in, just like at home.
Our host, Mindy, is absolutely the BEST! She’s checked on us several times to see if we’ve needed anything. The house comes fully equipped with everything you could possibly need. It’s got all the comforts of home and then some! Mindy has made sure of that. You’ll find all kinds of little surprises she’s provided for her guests. All you need are your clothes and your toothbrush!
You will want to stay here.
Terianne, Jim and John."

Stayed a few nights","We’re evacuees from the horrendous Dixie Fire. The day we were evacuated, we were extremely lucky to find this little gem of a house in Susanville, CA, through AirBnB. We have my 98 year old father with us, so it was important to us that he be as comfortable as possible, as we may have to here for awhile. This fire is out of control!
Mindy, our host, couldn’t be any more awesome as a host. She made sure we had everything we needed as we got settled in.
She has checked in on us a couple times to see how we’re doing. She knows we’re shell shocked from the devastation of the fire. We have several friends who have lost their homes. So far, ours is still ok. However, everything around Lake Almanor has burned, including two of our favorite little towns so far.
The house is decorated with a wonderful collection of interesting pieces of furniture and has all the amenities you need to be comfortable. It’s in a quiet neighborhood with really nice neighbors on both sides. All you need is your clothes and your toothbrush, because Mindy has taken care of every detail. Just in case you forget something, it’s not a problem because you’re conveniently located near grocery stores, drugstores, restaurants, and fast food places, as well as gas stations. Susanville is a small town with a lot to offer.
Mindy has prepaid a wonderful book that tells you about lots of things to see and do. You will love her!

Doria is a lovely host and communicates well. Her home is superbly neat and clean and just a very welcoming space. It was nice chatting with her in the kitchen whenever we saw her there. For us, it was like staying with family. That said, you could socialize as much or as little as you wanted with her and come and go as you please without any awkwardness. It is a quiet home and we enjoyed and respected the quiet time between 9 pm and 8 am. We look forward to staying there again."

I am always highly impressed by the cleanliness and the serene energy Doria creates. After a long drive it is heaven landing at her place. Communications with her are prompt, clear and super easy.
Highly recommending her place!
Thank you, Doria, for another great stay."

Susanville is a good place to stay for the night & cute spot to explore during the day but as I found out, during storms be careful on local roads/hwy and follow local regulations with weather. If you are an out of towner like me, carry snow chains/emergency supplies."

Her place is sparkly clean, the bed was super comfy, high quality sheets and towels (heavenly), and I slept like a baby after a long drive.
Doria's place has beautiful touches, loved the map where you can see where other guests visited from, the bathroom was equally sparkly clean. Easy to get in (keypad), although she was so wonderful and greeted me at the door. Safe and beautiful neighborhood, which was an extra bonus.
Great host, wonderful room, just like described.

I enjoy running in Susanville, it's beautiful. She just about left me stranded. Terrible experience. Luckily I was able to find a last minute room at a hotel, but I spent more than I wanted.

However, I would say you get a better deal staying here, because you can tell that the owners go out of their way to make your stay comfortable and convenient, not to mention clean too. The place was easy to find, even late at night in the dark; area to the room was well lit. The layout of the room provided us with enough space for our stuff and ourselves. Some of my favorite things I really appreciated was the washer/dryer, the extra amenities, and the high water pressure and temperature of the shower actually got nice and hot. Overall, we slept well, the night was peaceful and quiet. We give this place a 10/10!"

We navigated them fine but they could be a problem for anyone with balance or mobility issues - especially carrying your bags."

The BEST stocked apartment that I have ever been in with everything in bathroom, kitchen, utility closet with washer-dryer. Just amazing. The view of sunset and gorgeous outdoor gardens were so restful and enjoyable. I had a volunteer 3-day session at the high school and the location across the Susan River and a 2 minute walk to Main Street was a delight. The cabin is right down the street from the Bizz Johnston Nature Trail that we used daily after we were finished with work. WiFi was excellent so that my husband could work and not take any days off for this pleasant vacation. Everything about this stay was just wonderful. Andrea goes above and beyond with the many thoughtful, useful things stocked in the apartment. 10 stars!"

This is a quiet and pretty location and the studio unit is well equipped and has extremely nice decor. Everything we wanted was there- from good coffee to all the necessary appliances, and an easy to use Roku and TV which allowed us to stream on our accounts"

The studio was private, comfortable, quiet with plenty of amenities and nicely appointed. The bed was also very comfortable and there is a nice bathroom well stocked with personal care items. There are several stone steps that you have to navigate to get to the studio but manageable. We would definitely stay here again."

Easy to find, good location for in-town or for exploring, and nice parking right (a very minimal walk over a driveway, and down some natural-stone steps). Beautiful garden and surroundings that make you feel like you’re tucked away in a cabin somewhere. Quiet too. This is a terrific place for a short stay, or one much longer!"

The interior space is also lovely, with attention to design and comfort. Everything was so clean and organized and we had the best night’s sleep too. Andrea was very accommodating, excellent at communicating and made us feel welcome throughout our stay."

Added washer/dryer combo came in handy. The rock steps to the cottage might be tricky for someone with mobility issues but we had no problems. All in all, it was a pleasant surprise to be surrounded by beautiful trees and flowers in such a private setting. We’d love to return!"

I missed my check-in email and she happily helped me in.
The garden setting with a patio and amazing views is also beautiful, but involves a set of stone steps down to the front door that could be a concern for some people.
Overall this place is very comfortable, I felt quite at home. I wished I could have stayed longer to explore the nearby town and trails -- I will be back for sure!"

Group trip","Enjoyed gathering with friends and family at Sarah’s place for the weekend, we were in town for a wedding at a nearby ranch. The house comfortably fit 12 (the upstairs rooms are a bit small). The kitchen was lovely and well stocked, and the area was peacefully situated among tall pines. Sarah was very flexible for an earlier check-in and a later checkout. Note that there is only one shower upstairs, and the downstairs shower is in the master bedroom bathroom. The furniture and beds are a bit dated but get the job done. We had a few issues (some beds were missing linens, there were no spare trash bags) but Sarah was quick to rectify these issues. Overall, great value for the price and a great place very convenient to Far Far Away Ranch."

The deck was so peaceful and has a small charcoal grill and propane fire pit that allowed us to enjoy a great home cooked dinner and s’mores outdoors. The rooms are spacious and beds are comfortable.

Stayed a few nights","This home was the perfect winter escape during the onslaught of atmospheric rivers in California. If you’re looking for a secret place to stay connected while hoping to explore Lassen County (yes even in winter), then look no further. Not only did the amenities here provide Wifi, a comfortable rest, and ideal privacy, but the home also happens to be right next to the lake and the famous Lassen County. If you haven’t seen the snow capped mountains located five minutes away, you’d be depriving yourself of the hidden gems of California - some things are almost sacrilege to share! One of the unique places about this AirBnB is the rear loading lane. Arriving late at night in the dead of winter, there is no better amenity than unloading your gear that leads you nearly into the home, ensuring convenience and comfort at the same time. We’re absolutely returning as a winter home base!"

Just sharing those details for those who it matters to :) if I'm passing through this area again, I would definitely look for this place."

My husband and I, stayed three nights and loved everything about it.
It’s close to down town Susanville and about 2-2.5 from Redding, Lake Tahoe and an hour from Reno. Easy access to highway and all together just Wonderful.
Our host was very communicative and very kind.
Thank you Lary & Laurissa🙏🌹"

The place feels very cared for. It was very quiet and fortunately cool at night, so I didn't have to turn the AC on.
If you're extra sensitive, you may notice the mini power substation about 300 feet from the cabin. It didn't bother me, but I know people that may notice it.
I would definitely choose this place again if I'm in the area."

Loved the pillows.
If you plan on cooking you will need your spices etc.. as this place is brand new. Cooking items were there. I was sad I couldn’t enjoy the outside, BBQ or just sitting out in the front due to the never ending winter. I hope I get a chance to stay again.

Stayed a few nights","Ian was a kind & responsive host with clear instructions to get into the place. Unfortunately the photos were misleading as they didn’t portray the actual place. There was no stove only an old heating pad to cook on which included a heavily used with stains water kettle, microwave turn table broken so it doesn’t turn, bathroom failed to show the tiny shower & broken shower door which made getting into/use very challenging. We also didn’t realize the bathroom was in the master bedroom making it hard for bathroom use while someone’s sleeping. The pellet stove was not working which Ian acknowledged and gave a small credit towards our stay. The host gives multiple instructions to be courteous & quiet throughout our stay only to find out you can hear them the whole time, I was awoken by a crying baby at 12:30am along with the hosts overly noisy family cheering for a football game on Saturday night. So if considering staying here bring cooking device, ear plugs, and low expectations."

One thing we felt could have been portrayed was that the unit shares a wall with the host’s house… and children.

Overall though it was a wonderful stay at a wonderful price and the hosts were very responsive and respectful of our privacy.

It was quite cool outside at night (32 degrees) but with the electric heater made available, we were nice and cozy.
The property itself is gorgeous. Towering pines surround the property with a well-maintained, yet natural-feeling lawn area. We enjoyed sitting outside watching the chickens, turkeys and ducks walking around the property. The playground beneath the tress would be a wonderful space for young guests to spend some time.
With a shortage of quality lodging in the area, this affordable apartment in the forest is a place we plan to return to on another visit up north."

Stayed with kids","Guest quarters spacious and comfortable. Unreal Sierra campsite-like location with amenities. A great low-key, 4-acre, fenced Sierra pine filled property with a legit playground for children during the day and, for seniors (or younger adults without kids) like us, a great wake-up perimeter (rooster accompanied!) walk or jog. Ian and Natalie are vibrant and friendly hosts. We'll be lifetime return visitors.
As a side note, we were there during the Dixie Fire, and super appreciated the calm of Susanville, Janesville and the Rio Dosa neighborhood (especially our hosts!) in the midst of a very troubling (and smokey!) situation. We understand that the day of our departure some tireless Cal Fire firefighters used Ian and Natalie's airbnb, for at least one night, before the general Janesville evacuation. God bless them all! Thankfully, from afar on the internet, we could follow the day by day drama of the Dixie Fire and Janesville situation. It seems that after a close call, favorable winds and valiant fire fighting, much of Janesville (and Ian and Natalie and kids!) are now back, safe and sound.
We hope to see them all in the future as they carry on in this beautiful location."

Ian and Natalie provided pellets for the wood stove in the winter and standing heaters to keep us warm. They allowed us privacy and still managed to check on us to make sure thing we’re going smoothly. There were a few fixes to be done in the first few weeks and Natalie and Ian handled everything promptly. I highly recommend checking this place out if you plan to visit the area!

Our room was cozy and with direct access to shower. We enjoy our stay and will come back in future."

Stayed a few nights","I stopped here while visiting Lassen National park, it is about 40 minutes to the entrance of the park, but a beautiful drive. This is like when air Bnb first started and you knew you were in staying in someone’s house. This is an extra bedroom off the living room area. The room is very clean and the bathroom is clean with a great hot shower. The bed was comfy and I loved the flannel sheets with the chill at night. The room is used to store or display the urns and ashes of deceased pets, so just be sure you’re ok with that. I was told they were not people when I asked. This is a good spot for a solo traveler. I felt the area was safe and peaceful and I was able to park my car in the driveway. I didn’t find much food in the area, the coffee at blue ox was ok, but I couldn’t eat my food from there. There is a pizza place in town, but not much if you have dietary restrictions, so get some groceries. Mandy is a nice host and great tot all to."

Stayed a few nights","Amanda and her cohost have both been in Lassen/Almanor/ Chester/ Westwood for decades.
They know the insider details of what is going on in their hometown and region. They know reality and not current advertising. They know where the best sights are versus the on-line ads.
The home they share w AirBnB guests is quiet. Neighbors are quiet and nights silent except for train horn from miles away.
The room is a bit small for a big couple, but perfect for a solo visitor. Queen bed and linen were refreshing. Adjoining bath is verging on luxurious. They know how to cater to guests. The front patio is as calm and beautiful as their back yard.
They also know how to leave you space if that is your preference.
Their big dog (Tilly) ... she is a barker at new arrivals, but within two- minutes shewas bringing out tennis balls for fetch sessions.
If you are heading to or from Quincy or driving Almanor, this is a great layover without the hustle and traffic noise of Chester."

My wife and I used this as we were in between locations for our road trip. Amanda was super flexible, welcoming and her communication is top notch. She welcomes you in like it’s your own home and everything she has listed is 100% accurate. On top of that, Amanda has added little things into her airbnb that make it even better and make it evident that she really cares about the people who stay there.
Highly recommend if your passing through the area. It’s beautiful, down the street from Blue Ox Coffee which was FANTASTIC and makes travel simple with an awesome host."

Mandy prepped her coffee maker in the kitchen so that I just had to push the ""on"" button in the morning to make a pot and fill my go-cup.

She is also willing to help you with providing certain items that you missed to carry. Her dog Tilly is such a good girl sweetheart.
This is a great place to do stop by when visiting Lassen volcanic national park, lake Almanor, subway caves, Burney falls, lake Britton, and mount Shasta.
Tesla/EV owners: Supercharger available at Susanville (25 miles from host). The host provided us with a 110v regular outlet for your 5-15 Tesla mobile charger. This was a generous support from the host as we were able to charge 10% of our EV battery every night of the stay.
Overall, this is a great deal for a couple of folks. I would be happy to stay at this place in the future as well."

Sleeping in a private room in her house and there is a private toilet and shower. Amanda organizes the room right in hotel conditions She is a special woman and artist who lives in a beautiful, rustic and cozy home.
We became friends with her .
Amanda gave us free to use her kitchen, sit in the living room to watch movies and everything we needed to make us feel at home.
We sat with her sometimes in the evening . Sometimes even with friends who came to visit . We had a stunning experience getting to know her and would highly recommend to anyone interested in being friendly and enjoying a local and human experience."

Stayed a few nights","Amanda is a very welcoming host and made us feel comfortable fully utilizing the kitchen, living room, and other spaces during our stay. The bedroom and bathroom were clean and beautiful. Tilly (Amanda’s dog) was also a fantastic host! Tilly is so sweet and loved to show off her talent of holding two tennis balls in her mouth at once. I was very impressed.
We did have a little concern about the security of our items, however. There is no lock (from the outside) on the bedroom door and Amanda left the doors to the outside open throughout our stay (even at night or when she wasn’t in the house). I’m sure Amanda has great judgment and the neighborhood is safe, but it’s still something that is slightly alarming to a visitor unfamiliar with the area. We were also a bit out of the loop with who else would be in the home and when. No problems arose, but if this sounds like something that would be a deal breaker for you, make sure to communicate that to Amanda ahead of time."

Stayed a few nights","Amanda is just the best! She is absolutely lovely and so easy going. Her home is amazing, she knows how to decorate which makes you feel home. The garden is so awesome and beautiful. You can relax there, eat dinner or just look at the wonderful walls and flowers. She lets us stay the day we had to check out as long as we wanted.
Just one thing. The lovely Tilly is really cute when you get to know her but she is barking if you are coming in. We needed some time to get to the key because we where a little afraid of the barking. But everything turned out well and we had such a good time, nice talks and the best host ever! Thanks Amanda"

Stayed one night","Amanda has since apologized a lot about all this. She sounds like a very person, but when I arrived the dog mentioned in reviews (which looks more like a pitbull to me) was barking and when I tried giving her a dog treat, she growled. Having had very bad experiences with dogs in the past, I wasn't going to take any chances. I tried sending several messages to Amanda, but didn't receive any reply (she said later that was work and had leave her phone in her car). It then took over an hour to get an Airbnb rep on phone and by then all I could do was cancel the reservation. When Amanda was finally able to respond to me, she apologized and offered her place for free if I still needed one. But by then I was quite some distance away. If you choose stay here and have any issues with dogs, make sure something is done with the dog before you arrive."

When we were leaving she yelled at us and was extremely aggressive - even going as far as slamming cabinets and stomping around. It was a very uncomfortable experience for all of us, including our pets. We ONLY booked because it said pet-friendly, we communicated with her about the pets ahead of time, AND we followed extra instructions about kenneling our pets."

The backyard isn't completely fenced in, but the pups stayed within the boundaries. Amanda also offered me a variety of drinks, and she is a really great person to chat with! She really made me feel at home! The room I stayed in is on the first floor, and has everything you need. Amanda also placed some brochures there in case you needed some tips.
