Stayed a few nights","This home is super cute, nicely decorated and cozy. The photos online don’t do it justice- you really just have to experience it. It smelled awesome and was incredibly peaceful. It’s evident that the host takes pride in his listing and is committed to providing the very best experience for his guests. The neighborhood is quiet and close to everything. There’s a cute patio where you can sit and drink your coffee- the only drawback was those Boston Red Sox and Celtics placards on the fence🤣."

Stayed a few nights","Our group of 4 came in for The Masters and stayed here. Location is absolutely perfect for that as well as being able to get to things you need: Wal-Mart, restaurants, interstate, and of course Augusta National.
Troy was one of the most communicative and responsive hosts we've ever stayed with. Definitely made us feel at home with the welcome he provided our group along with helpful suggestions throughout. We even gathered lots of intel on the tournament thanks to his recommendation to go see Byron at the exchange. Without that info we would not have had the same positive experience at the tournament.
100% recommend Troy's home and should we ever be lucky enough to return we'll be booking here."

Stayed one night","Very nice place! Kept up well, many little bonus things around the house (take and keep and use and leave baskets in bathroom). All switches were labeled well. Easy to keep temperature perfect in the house. Host was responsive but not overly helpful. Asked about local recommendations, he just pointed me to his posting instead of having a conversation. Was paranoid about parties in the house. Message before we arrived to make sure we knew not to have a party and there was postings in the home as well. Some 1/2 used items in the fridge. Good location but a little tricky to get in and out of the neighborhood (easier if no traffic). Overall it was great! Would recommend staying here to others looking for a nice stop along the way. Very nice little house! Thank you!"

My dad wanted to watch football and he brought him an antenna and hooked it up so he could. And don’t worry Mr. Troy’s places has every streaming network you could think of. He was always available to my parents and so helpful. Even the neighbors were friendly and nice. Any time my parents come to stay, now they want to stay at Mr. Troy’s place."

The residence was located towards the Main Street which had numerous restaurants and had access to the highways, but it was far enough away from the busy intersections that provided a peaceful stay. If I am in the Augusta area again for multiple days, I would definitely seek to utilize this location again.
Thank you Jimmy!"

Group trip","Five of us were in town for my daughter's graduation from Augusta University, school of nursing. The locations is very convenient to most everything. I would say the area is lower middle class, but was surprisingly quiet, considering the number of tightly packed units and parked cars. Parking is tight, especially if you drive a larger vehicle. There is room for two vehicles, but that is it. The place could have been cleaner, especially the living room floor, it was very dirty and sticky, I have to think Jimmy was not aware, because I can't imagine he would have left it that way. A few other fairly minor things, but the bottomline is that it was priced right and in a seemingly safe area convenient to everything. It suited our needs for our weekend stay. We would definitely stay there again, if the price stays reasonable."

Stayed one night","The house was spacious and on a quiet street. It was mostly clean, other than a visibly very dirty air vent above the TV. The TV was difficult to use due to a obvious lag in the remote control. The couch had a lot of stains on it and needed to be cleaned. The fridge’s water machine was inoperable. Overall a bit disappointing."

Kitchen countertops and bathrooms did not appear to have been cleaned as well as I would have expected. The price was great and I was appreciative of Jimmy hosting. Just wished it would have been a bit cleaner.

Stayed one night","JoAnn's place is amazing. In town, but you wouldn't know it once you're there. Feels like you're deep in the woods when in fact you're right next to quite a busy thoroughfare.
My drive to JoAnn's place was harrowing at best. Rained for over 7 hrs straight. I realized that despite the rain i was going to arrive early. I really wanted to be off the road so I reached out and JoAnn immediately replied that I could come on over and provided an temp code for me to get inside.
The place itself is fabulous. Bathroom is amazing with seat and rainfall shower. The bed is adjustable which was a very pleasant surprise. The views out are fabulous though i didn't get to sit outside and enjoy due to all the rain.
You cannot go wrong staying here if you're stopping over or staying a few days. There is a small fridge, some snacks and water so keep that in mind. If you desire big meals you will have to go out or bring something to cook in the provided microwave. All in all an A+++ experience."

Joann is an ideal host. She makes you feel welcome from the moment you book, until your departure. We did not meet face-to-face but I felt her hospitality in the way the room was prepared, the clarity of communication, amenities...everything was setup to make me feel right at home.

We stayed with our mini poodle, Bailey. Often, when we stay in a pet friendly place, we can tell there were pets there before - but that was not the case here - it was immaculately clean.
One of the highlights for us was feeling tucked away in private retreat while being minutes away to downtown and spaces to explore. We especially enjoyed the parkland seeing some alligators at a park in Augusta.
As for the host, he was amazing! Proactive, friendly and clear. We so appreciate this stay and 110% recommend it!"

The cottage was clean, but not pristiñe.
The door that was used for access from the bedroom into the bathroom was a shutter door. The door did not provide enough privacy if someone was in bedroom while bathroom was being used.
The cottage was worth what we paid."

Stayed a few nights","Secluded, clean, and peaceful cabin. My husband and I were traveling through Augusta and spent two nights at Rob’s. We initially had planned to stay one night but the cabin was so well appointed and comfortable that we decided to spend another night. Rob agreed to extend at the last minute since it was available. He is very attentive and the place is well kept and is very comfortable. We don’t have any negative reviews.
The kitchen has nice sized dishes, a clean fridge and dishwasher. The bed is comfy and the shower has good pressure and hot water.
FYI The place is at the end of the road, the gps told us we had arrived but the neighbor told us to keep going past the “private property” sign (take the right after the sign). Plenty of space to park, and a great deck with views of the woods and a fire pit awaits you. We enjoyed walking the North Augusta Greenway Trail (3 min drive). The parking lot is a little hidden (past the pedestrian bridge). Don’t go into The Rapids neighborhood."

There are many birds, I saw a cottontail rabbit during my stay a couple of the days. The cottage is very cozy and modern, a perfect place for a couple or small family. The location is great, while you are very close to the city and anything you may need, it is a hidden gem nestled in a wooded area. I am a coffee drinker so the coffee and coffee maker were much appreciated. I enjoyed my mornings on the deck drinking my coffee and watching the cardinals and squirrels, very peaceful :)"

Stayed with a pet","This place is an absolute gem! As is Rob! He was super helpful with recommendations for food, golf courses, and even a few nearby dog-friendly trails/parks. The place is very clean and looks just like the photos. Checking in and out was simple and straightforward.
We loved being able to walk our dog around the pond and watch him go on a little sniffari. There’s an outdoor shower as well as a hose, which was great for cleaning off shoes and paws. Overall, I cannot say enough good things about our stay here!
DOG OWNERS: Knowing there was a pond and a high probability of mud, we packed a towel for our dog. I highly encourage anyone else bringing their dog to do the same. Rob kindly provides white towels for his guests. Now, white or not, I wasn’t about to potentially ruin someone else’s towel by using it to clean dirt/mud off paws. If your dog is joining you, keep this in mind and please be considerate and respectful of Rob and his place."

The kitchen contained just about everything anyone would need to cook and major stores for food shopping were not far. The fenced front porch deck overlooked a beautiful pond several yards away that one could view between the trees which surrounded the area. My dogs enjoyed lounging on the deck and the walks on paths around the pond. Just a short distance away is the Greeneway Trail that has 7 miles of paved trails for walking, jogging or bike riding. This was a beautiful quiet place to get away and relax. I would definitely go back and I highly recommend this beauty"

Stayed a few nights","This was such a wonderful stay. Loved everything about it. Stores are within a few minutes if anything is needed - but the serenity of the location allows a wonderfully peaceful day and evening. No need to worry about the wild-life. They let me do my thing, as I did the same for them. If they were near the cottage - I didn't know it. You won't be disappointed."

Stayed a few nights","Rob and the Oasis Cabin are truly awesome!
We were traveling from Asheville with our three dogs to support family and attend funeral services for a loved one. The Oasis served as a comfortable and comforting homebase in the midst of dealing with the logistics of everything and it made our difficult time a little easier.
The property is spacious and serene, the local take-out/delivery was fantastic and downtown Augusta for dinner/drinks was super enjoyable. Rob is easy to communicate with and thoughtful.
We loved this place."

The kitchen has everything you may need, measuring cups and spoons, cooking utensils, coffee maker, full fridge with ice maker, oven, pots, pans, cookie sheets, even mixing bowls, spices and oil (on top of the plates, cups, and silverware of course). The bed was soft and cozy, and the towels were plush. Bring a bath bomb if you’d like to try the soaking tub. The view of the pond is also very nice over coffee. Rob was great and met my girlfriend to show her around before I got there, then told us where to find the best sunset. Overall great stay."

Stayed over a week","This stay is super cute! The inside is exactly as pictured. Perfect for 1-2 people or if your on a business trip. There is a cute outdoor space at is your own and since I was there in the spring there was a beautiful tree from the neighbors yard that bloomed over my patio that made it like a garden space. Everything is updated on the inside and very functional for the space.
The only negatives I’d have to say is that some of the dishes I used I had to wash before I used them because they were dirty from the previous person. There is no dishwasher or oven if your a longer stay person. Lastly, the area is not that great. A little sketchy at night after dark, so if you go out just be very cautious.
Overall, I’d stay again. It’s a great stay just small negatives that don’t bother someone like myself. It was great for my business stay!"

Stayed about a week","This place is small, but has the best design of any small place I’ve ever stayed.
Firstly, it looks brand new, everything is updated, clean, & in perfect working order.
Unlike other small places, this place has two stove burners, no oven. There are plenty of pots and pans to cook with. Kitchen is fully equipped. Coffee maker, dishes, everything you could ask for in a small kitchen. The refrigerator is large.
The bathroom shower is large and updated. The closet has a dresser in it and plenty of room to hang your clothing (although there were no hangers)
There is a desk with a comfortable office chair to work on the computer at. Plenty of outlets and USB ports.
The bed is comfortable, and there’s even a reclining La-Z-Boy chair to enjoy the large television on.
Outside your door is a patio with a table, large umbrella and two chairs. There is also a barbecue grill.
The location is excellent, it was literally close to everything I wanted to do. I never had a problem getting a parking spot right outside the house on the street.
Laundry is available. This is quite possibly the most well designed small space I’ve ever seen. I would definitely stay here again."

The kitchen was perfect size, the desk was spectacular and big so I could get a lot of work done. The place looks like it has just been updated and has great little features. Alot of outlets, control of the fan and heating and cooling, and the tv was def was also a great addition. Super great stay!"

Stayed one night","5 stars just isn't enough...
the living space was VERY comfortable, clean, & accommodating. Tony was gracious enough to even leave us snacks, options for coffee, soft drinks in the mini fridge, & water in each bedroom....he even had a microwave & a countertop ice maker! (didn't even know those existed lol) on top of that there was a a mac computer available if you would like to use it, a library of DVDs, & even an Xbox 360 with games if you just wanted to play.
We were in town to DJ a wedding in Augusta so we were LITERALLY only there for a 10-11 HOURS (at the MOST). I stinks we couldn't have stayed LONGER & REALLY gotten to enjoy the comfort of this place to the full.
And to finish I'd like to comment about the host...Tony was an absolute gentleman & was incredibly understanding that we would have a late check-in due to the wedding. would ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT HESITATION ecommend this place to anyone looking for a weekend getaway or an even longer stay."

Stayed a few nights","We absolutely found a gem with Travis’s AirBnB. The location is perfect. Close to downtown, and area attractions. It is located in a cozy and beautiful neighborhood. Inside everything is extremely comfortable, and the stocked coffee bar and snacks were an extra bonus. The price was for sure a steal. We were in town for an event that draws a few thousand visitors (Ironman…not The Masters). I registered late, and when looking for a place to stay everywhere was booked and overpriced. I was so fortunate to land on this listing. The race was a struggle, but I won when I booked here!"

Travis goes above and beyond, we arrived to find a super informative binder full of a bunch of different things to do in the area, different restaurants, and all their menus to look through which I appreciated. Stocked with snacks when we arrived (which my daughter loved) and coffee which was nice :) 10/10 will be returning if we’re ever in the Augusta area again."

It was spacious enough for our group of 4 and I think it could have accommodated a 5th person if necessary. Everything was neat and clean. The beds were very comfortable and when the temperatures went down to the teens at night there were enough extra blankets for everyone. We were able to control the temperature as needed as well. There was plenty of coffee, snacks, water and soft drinks. There was even an ice maker, a small fridge, a coffeemaker and a microwave available for our use. I would certainly seek to stay at Travis' when I visit Augusta again."

The entertainment includes Xbox, and disk player, and Apple TV with Netflix and Hulu. The neighborhood is well-established; homes have been in place for quite some time - there is much history here. We enjoyed our time in Augusta thanks to Travis' place being all that it was advertised. Highly recommend."

Lots of extra toiletries in the bathroom too, along with plenty of towels and washcloths and a hair dryer. The place was extremely clean and very easy to find. Guests who have difficulty climbing stairs might not find this suitable for them. The host was very communicative and I didn’t have any issues during my stay.

Let me say, Travis keeps an immaculately clean home. Our communication was spot on. Even though I was driving in late he still had the space available early. It was easy to get in and out. He had all the information you would need to know about the house and surrounding community tucked in a guide book. After travelling for the day, we sank into the couch and watched a movie.
I will certainly book with Travis again in the future."

Stayed with kids","We stayed over night on the way to FL and it was a great stay. Exactly as described and Travis goes out of his way to provide complimentary snacks, refreshments and toiletries. The apartment was spacious and very private and we stayed with our toddler who loved having room to run around after the long drive. The beds were comfortable with softer pillows but if you prefer firm may want to bring your own. The apartment has its own heating/ac and was easy to control. The 2nd bedroom did get cooler but we left the door opened and that seemed to help. Travis was quick to respond to questions and let us know we could check in early and provided very easy check out. We would definitely stay again."

Stayed a few nights","From booking to check-out this was a seamless & comfortable stay. The beds were absolutely great. I’m home now but wishing I was going to sleep on that bed again! We took a picture to purchase of the tag, to order one of our own. Travis was great at communicating with us & gave very descriptive directions so there was no confusion. The home was a lot bigger than we were expecting. The owner added the nicest additions of snacks, coffee, water, pop, chocolates, & toiletries. The towels were plush & felt new. There were books, magazines (all about Augusta), tons of movies, an x-box (& games), a desktop computer, a large tv with streaming, & fast WiFi internet. We will absolutely look to book with Travis again when we return to Augusta in the future."

Be mindful that there is no kitchenette, just a mini fridge, Keurig coffee maker, table top ice maker and cups & dishes for drinks and snacks : )"

If you traveling near Augusta, Georgia I highly recommend for your to stay here. The rooms are incredibly clean and there is a mini kitchen area that includes a coffee machine, fridge and microwave. There is also coffee, tea, snacks, ice and Coca-Cola. When you first walk into the house you will find some chocolate and a bottle of water on the nightstand. In the bathroom there is shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel. In the mirror cabinets you will also find some body lotion. You can also read some books that are supplied or watch some movies. Overall my stay was great, it was incredibly clean and I’m sure Travis will try his best to accommodate you. I really hope that you can have the amazing experience I had. Thanks!- Anastasia"

Stayed with kids",We stopped in at Travis' place for an overnight stay before heading on to our final destination. The place was just as expected and a good value for your money. It was clean and quiet. I probably wouldn't suggest it if you have young kids (ours are 2 and 9 months). We felt bad because our baby was teething and had difficulty with being fussy and we were stressed because the owner lived below. It was decorated adorably but again that was hard with having young kiddos as they want to touch everything. But if our kids were older we would happily stay there again. It was comfortable and the perfect stopover.

The house was beautiful and very well-decorated. Everyone was in awe over the high-fashion decor and interior design. The house was very roomy, with multiple sitting rooms. We even hung out on the porches because the weather was so nice. The hosts were extremely responsive (even facetimed us when we had a quick question). Will definitely stay again next time we visit Augusta!"

Stayed a few nights","The hosts were great, very responsive and helpful during the stay. The residence looked exactly like the pictures. It was well decorated and designed. There were a few hiccups during our stay that they were able to resolve quickly. The heat, electricity, and hot water went out a few times during our stay but this issue was resolved in a timely manner. There was a ladybug infestation in the upstairs rooms, mainly the master bedroom and bathroom. I pulled back the curtain to find an outlet and it was about 15-20 dead ladybugs on the window sill. There were a few flying around the first night but by a couple nights in there were clusters of them on the bathroom window, bedroom ceiling and curtains. There were also spiders and other bugs in the master bedroom. Again, the hosts were very friendly and advised they will be exterminating after our stay due to the smell. Lastly, the first level bathroom could use hooks or shelves to put your things on. Overall I enjoyed my visit. Thank you!"

Very nicely decorated with thoughtful details like nightlights with USB ports, a baby bath, kitchen and laundry supplies, lots of blankets, black out curtains in the back bedroom and a drawer with toys and games. The garden is lovely with lots of roses and other flowers. Very easy to walk to the local stores/restaurants from here and easy to park outside. It is on a main road but the noise is negligible and the garden is fenced in which is a nice feature if you have young kids with you (like we did). The hosts were super responsive and helpful.

It’s evident in the experience itself and how the host handles day-to-day operation around the boat you really get to see that he has a complete and total passion for everything that he does in his life. I couldn’t read this high enough for the experience that I had there. And a good drink or cold brew, and come sit on the dock for a day with Greg. You won’t regret it 10 out of 10 will definitely be doing again."

Stayed one night","This boat was very clean inside and out. It appeared to be well maintained. In my opinion, it is located at the best slip in the marina. It is close to an elevated railroad track; a relaxing rhythm of the wheels occasionally rolling down the track was a beautiful complement to the ducks and crickets singing. I was fortunate to be there on a full moon. The moon reflected river flowed very slowly, It felt like it was pulled from a movie set. I took pictures and videos to show my friends how lovely it is. I felt very welcome and safe. As a female traveling solo, it was especially nice to know there were many boat residents close by, keeping a watchful eye. They were all friendly and yet, respectful of my privacy. I don't want to talk this place up too much because I don't want it to be booked when I want to stay there again. (-;"

Stayed with a pet","Unique opportunity to stay in a cozy houseboat on the river. Coffee on deck was a treat. Well located with easy parking and within walking distance to much Augusta has to offer. Bring earplugs, as a train does pass right by at night sounding it’s horn. The train only comes a few times though, and it is a fine trade off for the pear with of being on the water. There was no shower gel, shampoo, or hair dryer that we could find, so be sure to bring yours. There was water in the fridge and coffee and tea, which were nice. The shower stall was a nice size and the bed was comfortable. All in all, it was a nice stay. If you want luxury, stay elsewhere, but if you want a cozy, place on the water, don’t hesitate to stay here!"

Stayed a few nights","This was such a unique experience and incredible place to stay in Augusta! The boat only is on the end of the marina, offering incredible unobstructed views of the river and bridge. Greg and Steven were extremely responsive and proactive. They even invited us on one of their firework and sunset kayak tours the night we arrived but we already had reservations somewhere 😩
The marina has a shop and food cart which made getting drinks and snacks convenient during our stay.
We saw birds, rover otters, ducks, turtles, and other animals out on the water.
The marina is at the edge of the city but very walkable to all the restaurants and attractions in Augusta! I would definitely stay again!
Because you are on the water there are a fair amount of spider webs around the boat and some harmless small spiders inside the cabin. I have an irrational fear of bugs and was able to overlook this and relax during the stay. The cabin is clean and spacious but just be aware."

Stayed one night","Staying a night on the Savannah Rae gave us the opportunity to easily and quickly explore downtown Augusta and the Riverwalk.
We arrived in the early evening and were able to easily park, get into the boat, and walk a few trips of luggage down the boat ramp and onto the boat. The boat is very close to the parking lot. After quickly checking in, we immediately embarked on the Riverwalk as the marina is basically at its entrance. The walk got us closer to a few downtown pet friendly restaurants to choose from. We still had time to make it back to the boat to watch the sun set. It was beautiful and the setting was a little funky and rustic in a good way!
All in all, staying on the Savannah Rae was an effortless experience that provided immediate access to downtown Augusta. The unique setting on the water was beautiful and was just the icing on the cake!"

Stayed a few nights","This was honestly the best Airbnb I’ve stayed in! Because of how the address is listed, when I got in the area, I called to get clear directions…..👌🏾host was on point. Everything was explained and I’m such a humble uplifting way. Once I arrived, everything was direct from there. All instructions of how to operate things, are clearly listed and with just a call, anything else unanswered, you got a response. And fast!! From I stepped foot on the dock, I felt free and it was the same feeling the whole stay. This was my getaway trip. At night, looking out at the lights and water was the most peaceful thing I’ve ever felt to be so close to the water and nature while I went to sleep. The second night, it rained so I sat on the back and the sounds were so soothing….to top it off, fireworks were being released at an event nearby which made it even more beautiful! The train…..🥹 great! Everything was just on point!
Thank you all for having me!"

Stayed a few nights","Greg and Steven were great hosts. When we arrived, Greg was available to answer any questions we had and help in whatever way was needed. The houseboat is within walking distance from the farmer's market, which is awesome. We tried gator tail, which was FANTASTIC ! You have to visit. The boathouse itself was quite spacious and very clean. Even though we were asked not to use the stove, we did not miss it. between eating out and having other appliances to use, it was not an issue. As an extra bonus, Greg invited us to go kayaking down the river where we saw fireworks, a lovely way to cap off the evening.
We missed the otter who left us a present on the deck 😆.
Thanks to two guys and a boat! we had a lovely trip to Agusta. BTW downtown is great!"

Stayed a few nights","What a great place to stay and experience as part of it. Greg and Steven were great hosts, awesome detailed communication from start to finish, great local recommendations, and there are many options right off the dock including Kayaking the river, a gift shop, the river walk park, and restaurants are a plenty nearby all walkable. The place is as pictured, but the view just can't be captured. Sunset was amazing, Sunrise was nice, and then to top it off, fireworks by the baseball field around 9 or 10pm, depending upon game schedule, right from the roof of the boat. The bed was very comfortable, so were the many (6) pillows on the one bed. Great features inside the place, everything you need including a ice maker that was dedicated and not in the fridge. Hot water and water pressure was great. Ceiling fans in every room and on the front of the boat covered patio, and they were great ones with high speed and non of the noise on shaking like so many have, and so peaceful!"

I celebrated my birthday with family and friends during this visit. It was everything I could have imagined, and then some. Greg and Steven are extremely accommodating and very proactive with ensuring our stay had all of the keen qualities needed for a real getaway…..and adventure, with their “kayaking tours and services”, that we participated in. And, kayaking was a 1st time for me…something I never thought I’d ever do in this lifetime….lol. It was so much fun!!!
Thank you, Greg and Steven, for giving me a birthday I’ll never forget, and for making us feel like a part of your family….lol.

They were very accommodating and easy to talk to. Loved the location and privacy we had on the boat....it was JUST RIGHT for the 2 of us and would book again in a minute if we decide to head in that direction again.

Most of our time was spent on the back deck just basking in the beautiful surroundings!! Thank you, Steve & Greg for sharing such an amazing place with us!! We will most definitely be back!!

Stayed a few nights",We've enjoyed our stay. Celebrating my wife's birthday and this was the perfect gift. The minute she walked through the sliding door she was in awe! We talked about staying on a boat in the past but we just never found one worth staying until I found this listing. It has everything that you would look for when staying in a house. This choice was better than a hotel because you have water views all around you. That's why we chose to stay here. I love staying by the water and you can't get any closer than this. It was close to the Riverwalk. Bed was very comfortable. Waking up to the water was awesome. Open floor plan was quite comfortable. Being able to eat and enjoying the water views are priceless. Lastly I saw the local news interviewing our hosts on their contribution to the community and how they do a once a month cleanup around the Riverwalk. It shows the true character of the people you are renting a houseboat from. They are really nice people who cares about their community.

Stayed with a pet","AVOID! This is either a scam or a very unsafe situation. 3 hours after we left, the owners contacted us with pictures of the place not as we had left it and demanded a ridiculous amount of money. None of the damage was there when we left and it surely wasn't caused by us. We met the owners the day before check out and had a conversation with them where they asked us all about our jobs and what not, joking about how much more money we must make since they just rent kayaks and what not instead of having careers. How ironic that the next day they come after us for money for damages that we have nothing to do with. If the damages are real, it's due to how unsafe the situation really is there. We have stayed at tons of Airbnbs and never encountered such a horrible situation or accusation.
Here is the issue: The boat sits unlocked in a busy public marina with lots of foot traffic. The front door is left unlocked at check-in and check-out. The back door is unlocked 24/7 because the latch is misadjusted and does not secure at all. In addition to the public traffic from the marina, the foot ramp to access this boat is less than 20 feet from the entrance to a large city park. Any one of the nine homeless people I passed on my morning walk the day we left could have easily gone in for a look around or to do whatever unfortunate thing that went on to cause the damage after we left.
Besides the security issues, I lacerated my hand on one of the sharp edges of internal trim in the boat. This impacted my ability to work for the following week. I did notify the owner that I cut my hand and accidentally got some of the blood on the bedsheets. I put them in the wash when we left and offered to reimburse if it didn't come out. Instead the owner billed us $1600 for other damage that we didn't cause and was not there when we left.
Avoid this disaster and these scam artist hosts at all costs."

Stayed a few nights","Instead of driving a few hrs to a coastal destination, my wife and I instead chose to spend the weekend here at home in Augusta. Best decision we've made in a long time!
We couldn't speak any more highly of Greg & Steven...
Extremely friendly, attentive, and super accomodating. As perfect as anyone could hope for in a host.
The boat has everything you might possibly need to fully enjoy your time there. Be that relaxing/playing games/eating outside on the front & back of the boat, taking in the incredible views & surrounding sights, relaxing inside, in a completely warm, comfortably appointed interior.
The views are spectacular, particularly in the bedroom (super comfy bed and pillows) giant windows face the old railway bridge, & the new footpath on the 5th St bridge in full-view through the glass sliding doors.

We live here in Augusta, so she and I are familiar with all the local attractions/destinations/eateries, but suffice it to say, you could spend a week aboard the boat, and have a completely different culinary experience for every meal, and never drive more than 5/10 min.
All of Broad St and everything it has to offer is well within walking distance, and if you're visiting here there is some really great stuff to take in. The comfort and convenience of staying aboard the boat honestly makes anything you might want to do extremely easy/stress free... It's was an amazing experience.

We just left yesterday, and we’re already looking forward to the next time we come back!

Thanks again guys Jeff and Laura ❤️"

The toilet system is different but neat. The air is very refreshing. You literally want to sleep with the windows open. I don't suggest that as the bugs are plentiful out there. Staying on a boathouse makes you want to invest in one. You won't regret staying here!!"

Part of our wedding weekend was in West Augusta while the other portion was in Aiken South Carolina. This house was a quick driver to either.
Overall it was vey clean, and had what was promised. We would stay here again.
Also please know the host made everything so easy."

Stayed with kids",This was our first airbnb experience. We were only there 2 days for a graduation. The house is clean and cute and works great to allow you the comforts of home away from home. Our only problem was it is not easily accessible for my mother in law who is on a walker. I thought I had asked about a bedroom on the main floor but it required up or down a few stairs to get to a bedroom. The bathroom upstairs was a walk in shower which was great. We made it work and would come back if we didnt have our mother in law with us. It was definitely more cost effective and a million times more comfortable than a hotel.

This place was exactly what we needed: a spacious and easy-to-live-in house with a big fenced yard for family with dogs and children.
Very comfortable beds! And no demands about excessive tidying up before leaving. That's what the cleaning crew is for - which makes the 10:00 checkout doable. Thank you! A pleasure being there."
