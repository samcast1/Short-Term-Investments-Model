The description and the pictures were nice, but we found it to be better than we expected. Mariana messaged us daily to make sure everything was in order which it was. All in all staying here was wonderful and well worth the price we paid."

Stayed a few nights","We had a great stay at Mariana's place.🙏🏼
The apartment is really very nice and stylishly designed! You were right at least.
Large kitchen with everything you need. The apartment was very clean.
The TV was a SmartTV, which also allowed you to use Netflix and Co.
It is a highly recommended accommodation and Mariana has always made every effort to ensure that everything runs smoothly and pleasantly.
The only downside (for all smokers), there is an absolute no smoking on the entire property, even outside! In case of disregard, it will be expensive
Unfortunately, we were affected here and had to enjoy our morning cafe & cigarette on the walkway.😅"

Stayed about a week","The unit was exactly as described. It was perfect space wise for two people and was very comfortable, The kitchen had everything we needed as we tend to eat in a lot when we travel. The only thing missing was a corkscrew (minor thing) but Mariana delivered one to our front door the next day. It is convenient to stores, restaurants, and golf courses. If I could have rated Mariana higher than a five (5) in communication, i would have. She was very attentive and prompt with her replies. Parking is in front of the unit and can be a little challenging as there is a school nearby and parents line up to pick up there students, but if you pay attention to times and what you're doing, it's NO PROBLEM at all. I would definitely recommend this unit!"

The bed was great, the kitchen and dining area nice, and the living room comfy for the brief rests we needed during the busy week. Quiet and peaceful in a relaxed neighborhood was so much better than any busy hotel. Mariana was attentive to any questions and needs and we were well taken care of! Thanks again for a beautiful stay!"

Stayed a few nights","Mariana's place was PERFECT!!! The pictures were point on if the home and it was so inviting. The couch was very comfortable to relax after long days. I wasn't there much as I was there for an event at the RP Center (5 minutes away). However, let's just get a ""hallelujah"" for the comfort of the bed! It was amazing.
I loved the office/ dressing/ washer and dryer area..... Perfect for meetings.
I will definitely be staying again when in the area and would highly recommend it.
Mariana was very communicative and responsive. Would check to see if I needed anything but was not intrusive."

She is wonderful to work with and pays attention to the details. There are so many nice things about her place and I like it that it is close to restaurants and a main Highway. I hope her place is available the next time I have to make this trip.

The bnb was easy to locate, easy instructions to get in and the house was clean. The area doesn’t have much locally so nothing is really walkable. But Ubers we’re easy to use to get around. I asked for a later check out time due to flight delays and she happily accommodated."

My husband enjoyed drinking his morning coffee in the covered front porch.

It would have been 5 or 6 stars if I could all round if it weren’t for some minor cleanliness items that were already discussed with the host. Overall, great stay."

Stayed a few nights",This place was perfect for my bf and I. Walkable to bars and restaurants if you are down for a 10-15 min walk. The location is amazing. The only bad thing I can say is it you are trying to cook some of the stovetop burners will turn on and then turn off…it was kind of weird. While we were there there was also a huge man hunt for a guy on the block which made us a little scared but other than that it was a fun vacation. Thank you.

Stayed a few nights","This 1920s bungalow in Dixieland is just as described. It is clean, updated and decorated with comfortable furnishings. It is spacious for one or two people. Not pictured is a nook off the bedroom that includes a desk, as well as a washer and dryer. As others have stated in their reviews, the hot and cold are reversed in the bathroom. It is a minor inconvenience. The kitchen has everything needed for meal preparation.
The home is located across the street from an elementary school and within walking distance of a lovely park. The driveway is tight but manageable when care is taken to back into the assigned parking spot.
If you’re a golfer, there are many courses from which to choose. If you do not have a rental car, an Uber to Big Cypress Golf Club is $10 plus gratuity.
If you’re a teacher attending the Center for Guided Montessori Studies at Lakeland Montessori School, this bungalow is a great option as a short-term rental."

Parking is very tight as there are 2 units & requires backing into fairly busy street. The plumbing is switched in shower so hot is cold & vice versa. Small quirk that adds to the charm of this older home! Great choice for a single or couple traveler."

Stayed about a week","This space is beyond a gem. Mariana goes above and beyond. A beautiful modern space indeed. Everything you can possibly need and then some. We were able to cook and enjoy our time in a very clean space as well as a very tranquil neighborhood. There is even a Walgreens within walking distance to get anything else needed in a moments notice.
Prior to our stay, I wrote to her asking if there was an iron and an ironing board in the unit. She stated there was a steamer. Which is fine of course. She then proceeded to purchase an iron and a small ironing board for our use prior to our arrival. That was not necessary but definitely greatly appreciated. Very kind and thoughtful of her. One can tell she genuinely cares about being a host. I will definitely stay again for sure."

The beds were pretty comfortable and there were plenty of linens and items in the kitchen to work with. The bedroom doors are thin so you can hear the noise from the kitchen. Other than that, our stay was fine!"

Stayed a few nights","This place was not only welcoming and immaculately clean, it was located in a beautiful neighborhood that was close to all the places we needed to be. Stephen proactively reached out to us checking in with us before during and after our visit.
We had plenty of room for the four of us visiting- and the place had all the amenities from home. I was able to cook some special meals for my family and we could relax in the living room to watch tv and do laundry when we needed to.
The checkout instructions were clear and easy.
This is a true gem in Lakeland and Stephen and Madalyn were perfect hosts. We will definitely return for the next time we are in Lakeland- which we likely will be since our daughter performs often with the Lakeland Community Theatre.
I can not recommend this place and these hosts enough!!"

I am just wondering , how come they charge hefty cleaning fees and expect us to clean before we leave the house .
I would have preferred putting dishes in washer , (luckily we didn’t have many),turn it on and leave . It was expected to put them back in its place , so we have to plan accordingly."

They were very welcoming to our small dogs (hard to find!) and the pups certainly enjoyed the backyard. The hosts were very responsive when we arrived late into the night after a storm and had some questions regarding the lock. As for the stay itself, the house was exactly like the pictures and located on a lovely, quiet brick lined street. There was a great supply of household items such as toilet paper, which I’ve experienced, can be very limited at other rentals I’ve been to along with other items such as shampoo and conditioner. All in all, we had a fabulous time and plan on coming back here when we return. Thank you both for making my weekend with my grandparents a breeze!"

If you like a little hike try the bakery Born and Bread Bakehouse...only opened on Saturdays and Wednesday. Easy drive to Tigertown if you like baseball. We hope to return next year.

All of our needs were taken care of as well as any requests we had or questions during our stay were answered immediately with no hesitation. You can’t ask for any better!! The property was so beautiful. The location was excellent and easy to get to all surrounding stores and routes. Starbucks was a plus 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻We even stayed with my three Fur babies :) and the fenced yard was fantastic for them to run and play to release all their energy!!!
Cold A/C nice hot showers and great entertainment systems if you just want to have a relaxing day and hang out.
The laundry room was a perfect size they even provided detergent so we could have all of our clothing clean before we repacked and left back home.
To be honest, my favorite part was the kitchen. They had not only everything that we needed down to plates silverware, Tupperware, coffee k cups of all flavors , seasonings for us to cook….you can’t get any better then this!!
Last, but not least the beautiful view at the end of the street of the Lake It truly is a pleasure.
Cant wait to stay again and looking forward to staying at the other properties they manage."

This was my first Airbnb room, and I know they are not all like this, but Melanie’s private entrance suite was perfect! I am starting to travel to Legoland for business and I wanted to cut some drive time (interstate 4, specifically). Arriving on Sunday night at 9pm, I had a very restful night’s sleep and around a 20 minute or so drive time the next day. Her attention to detail is remarkable (!!!) and I will stay again!
The private entrance and private backyard were amazing. It was enchanting, especially in the morning when I woke up to a treasure - natural beautiful landscaping and a well placed yoga mat that was available for use.
Thank you, Melanie, for my experience. 🙂✅"

A few ""amenities"" not listed that really are great perks: 1) great overhead lighting in the living room, but also lots of lamp lighting if soft and mellow is more your jam! 2) hooks EVERYWHERE! So great for towels, keys, purse, sweatshirt, lifejackets, clothes, etc etc! Also can we talk about those beds?? I would spent $80/night to sleep in a cardboard box if it came with that bed. Having laundry is a huge plus when you're traveling light and/or with kids. Overall, 200% recommend if you're looking for a home base in Lakeland!"

""duh"" like how to unset the shower drain. It's full house but divided into separate ""apartments"" to rent, but with totally separate entrances, very private. I saw another car while I stayed but otherwise never heard or saw any other people staying in other parts of the property. Has a under-counter fridge which was perfect for leftovers and lunch sandwiches, because in Lakeland there are so many scrumptious restaurants we ate out for dinner the few days we were there. Very pleasant, very comfortable. thank you!"

Each made do with fewer rooms than expected. Perhaps each group just made a poor assumptions that could be avoided with a clearer description. Suggestions 1. Have a paper towel roll in kitchen area. 2 Post a copy of the written rules in the area. 3. Have instructions on how to use remote control and TVs. 4. Post a reminder of shoes off request on outer door. In Summary it was a lovely place in a lovely neighborhood and besides confusion with the other group I was very satisfied and recommend highly. Thanks Matt"

Stayed a few nights","For a family that would have to pay for two hotel rooms, this would be a good deal, but for the two of us, I kind of wish we had chosen a hotel instead. The furniture was uncomfortable and gave me a migraine. There was some confusion trying to find the check in information and the door knob is so close to the door jam that it pinches your finger if you’re not careful turning it. There was no shampoo/conditioner in the bathroom, the kitchen is awkward and tiny crammed inside the laundry closet with the central air unit. It is in a beautiful area but not within walking distance to any restaurants or grocery stores. And since the house is divided into multiple rental units you hear others in the house. Very strict parking instructions and other rules. Just overall felt like a stressful stay instead of a valued guest. He kept emphasizing being a good guest but didn’t show he was a good host."

Awoken Sunday morning at 8 am with more construction work. Seller is not easy to work with. Seller failed to disclose state of other half nor acknowledge that the other half was under construction. Hopefully by the time you stay the house will be completed and you don’t need to communicate with seller.

Additionally, it was close to downtown, which has a ton of great places to eat. Matt was very responsive.

After talking with him he allowed me to check in early for a small fee. It was nice to have that as an option. The pictures make the place look bigger than it is. It's not tiny but in my head I thought it would be bigger. Everything has been updated nicely except for the shower/tub area. I thought for sure it would look nicer than it was. The shower worked very well. But just the decor of it. Old tile, water stained handles, etc. Just expected more from a new renovated place.
Overall though it was a very good place to stay though! I'd stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","The house is clean and in a beautiful location! The host is very communicative. The kitchenette was more than enough for our needs. We only had 2 drawbacks and they are not necessarily bad things depending on what you are looking for. First of all the beds and pillows and VERY soft. If you like soft mattresses great! But we had trouble sleeping and ended up with a lot of back pain. Again that's very person specific. Secondly the suite is attached to the main house which means doors, dog barks, voices, etc carry through. The host was great about keeping sounds down at night. Unfortunately we were trying to nap in the day often. Ear plugs will fix that one if you have a weird sleep schedule like us. Otherwise the place was wonderful! This is by no means a negative review, but I often wish people would comment on mattresses and showers when im looking for a place to stay. (P.s. shower does get nice and hot)."

Stayed with kids","BEWARE, this home has storm damage to the roof, the soffits are missing, the roof is covered with a tarp, it is not in the condtioned that is pictured. It has been damaged for 7 weeks and exposed to Florida humidity. We entered the home at 1 am and could not see the damage outside. Upon entering, there was a very strong smell of mildew and it was very damp inside the home. I thought that turning the air up would help. Considering the vents are in the ceiling running the air made the smell even worse instead of better. Upon waking up in the morning our nose and throats were burning and my son who has allergies was very congested and had a headache. I searched the home for mold and discovered the damaged roof. We left immediately and informed the owners. The owner refused to offer a full refund and made a stressful situation even harder. If I was made aware of the damage to the home I would have chosen to stay at a different property. The home is well decorated and could be lovely but unfortunatly at this time it is in need of roof repairs."

Group trip","I didn’t have a very positive experience staying at Matt’s place. The space was clean, but quite small and not well-suited for more than 2-3 people. There were a number of thoughtful touches and the host was very quick to respond. This said, the place was advertised as having a stove, and we quickly discovered that the tiny kitchenette does not allow for any meal prepping or cooking. This was a deal breaker, especially during a pandemic when you have a high care to avoid dining out."

Stayed a few nights","My friends and I traveled for a quick trip to Lakeland for a friend’s wedding. Matt was a wonderful host and we absolutely loved the space. From the very beginning, communication was quick, clear and very responsive. Matt was kind to accommodate when our plans changed and was always quick to respond. We appreciated the care that went into the suite as well. Perfect size for our group and the space was clean, nicely decorated, and private. The neighborhood location is also amazing and just a short drive to all the fun restaurants and coffee shops. Overall we really enjoyed our stay at Matt’s and would easily recommend it to anyone traveling to Lakeland!! Thanks Matt!"

Stayed about a week","In the travel industry there is a term called ""duty of care"". Meaning that companies sending employees on the road for work have a duty to ensure those people feel cared for and safe. Cheryl is a pro at ""duty of care"". I walked into her home expecting to have a long list of items to get at the store, but she had everything you could possibly need for the stay. When I was worried about the lovely plants in a storm, she came and made sure they were going to be safe from damage. The neighborhood is nearly silent in the evenings and the porch is really the star of the show. Highly recommend for a short or long stay."

This home has plenty of room and we appreciated the snacks left for us in the kitchen. Added bonus was use of a washer & dryer. We never had that at any other Airbnb.
This home is well decorated and the front porch is to die for. 🌴 I sat on the porch many times enjoying the sunshine and peacefulness of the neighborhood. I even took a walk around the block on 3 days just to admire the other homes in the area. Plenty to do and lots of restaurant choices nearby. We recommend Black & Brew Coffee House downtown for coffee and breakfast. We went there twice! Fish City Grill was another favorite having dinner there our last night. Thank you for offering your home, Cheryl."

If you have done your homework regarding Lakeland and it's many lakes, and preservation efforts towards its water fowl, particularly the swans on Lake Morton, located in the center of the city, you would jump at the opportunity to rent this place. It's a classic craftsman style home that's impeccably decorated by it's owner (Cheryl), I am looking forward to our next stay at this home. Two strong thumbs up."

An activity we had planned was cancelled because of weather and she gave us a fantastic plan-B. This AirBnB is well worth the price. We will stay here again when we return to the area."

Cheryl’s place was immaculate, which was very reassuring these days, tastefully decorated and simply furnished in keeping with the 1920s bungalow style, thoughtfully equipped with the essentials, and a delightful retreat, especially sitting on the beautifully renovated front porch amid the lush greenery. Wish we could have stayed longer! We will definitely look to stay at Cheryl’s place again in the future. Thank you for your wonderful hospitality!"

The bed was really comfortable, a softer but firm mattress. We loved being so close to the Lake and enjoyed recreating in the area.
The only thing that I wish had been made more clear is that there is no smoking on the property. We went for walks to smoke but it would have been enjoyable to respectfully sit on the porch to do our thing."

Stayed a few nights","Let me start off by saying that this place is a dream! Awesome quiet neighborhood with lake Hollingsworth in the mix, a lake they made this stay more at home. Let's forget the lake for a sec, the host is who made this stay even better. Cheryl, when you & potential renters read this I just wanted to say thank you from the bottom of my heart because you're genuine, very transparent, & completely there for your renters, no matter how many YouTube vids it takes. You made my renting experience super accommodating. Small note, I love clean cars so having no sprinklers was a huge plus in my book. The parking is great being right in front of the house. I will admit, when I received the instruction text the day before I kind of thought she was going to be a possible rough host, absolutely not, Cheryl was/is worth every penny. BY FAR the best place I've rented from Air BNB & will definitely be going back. I now have experienced Lakeland FL for the first time & really loved it, it was the peace for me guys. Also being located in between two big cities worked out very well with many possible activities, only if you're willing to take the trips out there. This home is perfect for just yourself or for a couple. Again, Cheryl you were the epitome of what a host is & absolutely nothing short of sheer professionalism and with a splash of spectacularism lol"

Would not recommend long stay. Wifi modem in front unit, spotty to weak service in the back unit{ours} mentioned screens had been fixed by me on the porch, was told no one uses the outside of the house. Bushes that impeded front door were cut back 3 days before we left, we were there 2 1/2 months

Extremely clean, no dust anywhere, not even on the blinds, which is a constant battle at my own house. And not on the piano, which is also impressive since it probably does not get used much. It’s old, but very well done, not cluttered. Kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, all very clean. We didn’t cook there, but everything looked functional. Loved the desk and work chair in the bedroom as I had to do some work. WiFi was fine. Lots of storage in the closets. The shower had great water pressure and water was hot. Again, bathroom was older but very clean, no issues. Highly recommend and would absolutely stay again if my daughter chooses Southeastern."

We thought the two beds were great. Couches were not quite as comfortable, make use of pillows to settle in for great tv time with Netflix or whatever. We watched a movie or two each night. It is right on a road so traffic noise is not terrible but occasionally there is some knucklehead coming by with loud mufflers or stereo. I am fairly sensitive to that sort of thing but did not need to use ear plugs. We got good needed rest here."

The space was private, it was lovely having a backyard, and the rooms were comfy for us. It was very child friendly, which was a big plus. Lots of storage too. The location was really close to Circle B, and absolutely beautiful nature preserve, and we went there almost every day. Tatiana was very responsive whenever we needed anything. I highly recommend her place!"

Stayed about a week","Tatiana keeps a wonderful home and is very attentive with any needs or concerns you may have. This unit is tastefully decorated, and in a wonderful, central location. The neighbors are quiet, but the property is directly across the road from the SEU soccer field which can get a little noisy at times during games. The kitchen has everything you could need, and the washer and dryer are so nice to have available. If you aren't from Florida, be aware that you may see Palmetto bugs in the unit. We saw a few during our week-long stay, but it is a part of being in Florida. Thanks again Tatiana!"

There were many restaurants and useful stores around the area. I especially enjoyed the pool table and cooking in the kitchen without having to worry about not having the right pots and pans because the host(s) had everything in the kitchen to use.
There was a situation that occurred during our stay and the host(s) were quick to respond and ready to help with the situation. I will definitely stay at this home for my next visit in Lakeland."

The house is plenty spacious and was a great location. The kitchen has some odds and ends of utensils and baking/cooking pans and dishes. We worked with what we had but I wouldn’t say it had everything you need in the kitchen. Nice that each bedroom had access to a bathroom and loved the indoor fireplace and pool table for additional entertainment. Communication was very clear and timely and check in and check out was very smooth. I would recommend this stay especially based on the cost!"

Above and beyond any hotel experience I have ever had, I'm never going to back to staying in a motel. Quiet neighborhood, central to areas we wanted to visit. Everything we needed for a weeks stay was provided and Pedro was proactive with instructions so I did not have to ask about anything even once. All in all, fantastic experience and we will choose again next year if available!"

Stayed with kids","We were here for 9 days felt like a home away from home. The world can be so small sometimes in connecting with the we found out they were fellow Canadians and too make it even crazier they had family that owns an airbnb right in our backyard. When we booked it we didn't realize we had friends a short distance away. If you stay here make sure you visit Circle B bar reserve it was one of our favorite spot to see a bunch of wildlife. The location is very central to Florida an hour give or take to both Tampa and Orlando airports. Close to Disney, Legoland, Busch gardens, Clearwater Beach. We made lots of day trips to all these places. If you wanted to stay close Lakeland has everything you need. Dont forget to try Fred's Restaurant southern home cooking buffet and Catfish country to get you catfish, gator and frog legs. Also when your in town make sure you get to Whiskey Bent BBQ supply. We would for sure stay here again. The McMasters and Hunter families."

Stayed with a pet","Nice sized house in a convenient location, safe neighborhood. A little disappointed in how minimal the furniture/decor was in the house. However we took pets and the open house/minimalist space and the fenced yard were perfect for our needs. But don’t expect to entertain here, minimal seating and not an inviting atmosphere.
One concern was lack of curtains on some of the windows. Anyone driving/walking near front or back of house can see in day or night. Also, all smoke detectors were disconnected.
We had a good stay, but felt improvements could be made. Thank you for your hospitality!"

Board games, pool toys, cleaning supplies, movies.. all the makings for a great anniversary weekend for me and my husband. If I had to list some complaints I would have to say. The back window could use some curtains or blinds for more privacy. And maybe some clear instructions on how to work the thermostat and lockbox. Otherwise the house was great lol I didn’t want to leave."

I needed to invite a few family and friends over to cut a cake for my daughter’s 8th birthday and I explained it to him and he was very kind. I would stay there again and recommend it.

Stayed with a pet","Frankie’s place was perfect for what we wanted ,,, this was a family trip based around the pool and it didn’t disappoint. Everything was as described. Stores are close which was a plus , in our short time we went to Publix , target and Walmart . If you are looking for the ritz this may not be your place but if your looking for a family friendly place with an awesome pool then come to Frankie’s! I personally was impressed with some of the extras that you don’t think about before you do a airBB , over the years we have learned to bring extra paper towels , toilet paper, dish washing detergent , laundry detergent,,, I even bring an extra sponge ,, well Frankie’s had all of this ,, I didn’t need to use mine so hots off to him,, AC worked great too and there was 2 TVs so it was absolutely perfect for what we needed! Would go again in a heartbeat"

Hosts were very responsive to questions. It was nice to have all the pool toys, floaties, etc. available to use. Huge master suite and bathroom. Nice kitchen with all the amenities you can think of. We were a family of 7 and used the pool several times a day so probably would recommend bringing your own extra pool towels as we washed them every evening. Big, spacious house, perfect for us and our pets."

I loved the cottage and would book again hoping they fix the issue with the hot water.

Stayed a few nights","Absolutely perfect. I lived in Lakeland for many years abs moved away a few moths ago. I took an impromptu trip back to Lakeland and was fortunate enough to find Serenity available. Pet friendly and affordable. Steve was gracious with my multiple questions and when I locked myself out. My dog, Misha loved the cold terrazzo floors after walks around the lake in the Florida heat. The space is large, nostalgic and decorated with simple, Lakeland decor that is true to the local artist, Swan loving community. Super comfy King bed, very quiet neighborhood, fully stocked kitchen, and WiFi. I got my steps in with multiple trips a couple blocks away to lake Morton, which is home to tons of aquatic birds, but Lakeland is specifically known for their Swans. My local Lakeland recommendations for visitors: Swan Brewing (try the Bean), the downtown Saturday market, Mitchells Coffee House, Born and Bread and Palace Pizza. Staying in the historic district on the lakes, refreshed my soul."

Stayed a few nights","Cute little mother in law suite located 15 mins walk from downtown, 4 mins walk from Lake Morton and 10 mins to Lake Hollingsworth. Location is a huge plus, and Stephen was very communicative and welcoming. The main drawbacks: the WiFi (which was not fast enough for video calls, which I needed to do one morning for work so ended up using my phone as a WiFi hotspot after the connection froze several times), and the somewhat dated finishings (linoleum floors, rickety pocket door on the bathroom…). Also, keep in mind that the car park area is right outside the bedroom windows, so sometimes if a car pulls in early in the morning or late at night with lights on, it’ll light up the room, even with curtains pulled. Overall, a well-located, affordable place to stay for 2-3 days."

Stayed with a pet","We had a great stay at this clean, comfortable and adorable place. The neighborhood is upscale and quiet. It had everything one would need for being away from home. The king bed was firm and comfortable with good linens and lots of extra blankets if you need them. The kitchen had what we needed including coffee and cream and a few extras that made it personal. The bathroom is cute, with many toiletries and good water pressure. I loved the terrazzo flooring throughout and the pink tile in the bathroom. There were family games and the TV had Netflix. My dog was welcome and that’s important to me. The yard was pretty with a deck and seating. Stephen checked in on us and was very accommodating to a special request I had. I almost forgot to mention that this has cold AC which is a must here in Florida! We will definitely be back!"

Stayed a few nights","A great place in a great location. For those who don’t know Lakeland that well, this is a really nice location between two of the larger lakes in Lakeland with easy access to fantastic local cafes and food. A bit of a longer walk to The Joinery and the rest of downtown, but still not bad. About a quarter mile to the library and art museum. Short walk to one of the richest architectural treasures in the US, Florida Southern College.
The house is a really cool, more than a century old bungalow. The place you will stay is a well appointed cottage behind it. All around great vibes and accommodations.
Stephen was an excellent host, super responsive and helpful. Highly recommend."

Stayed with a pet","Steven’s beautiful bungalow had clean floors with soft textile rugs and fabrics. The place smelled fresh and clean. There were board games to play, and plenty of channels to watch. There’s an well-kept outdoor patio with clean, maintained furniture and a cute backdrop for pictures. Steven also left a fresh pitcher of water, coffee creamer, and wine in the fridge. Oh and the giant bean bag was a blast for relaxing and watching tv. My 8-year old loved it.
The bungalow was only a few blocks away from Lake Morton. There are plenty of restaurants, shops, and parks within walking distance.
This place felt like a steal. Probably the best Air B&B I have stayed in. The price was exceptional."

Stayed with a pet","We had the most wonderful week long stay in Stephen’s accommodation. He was so friendly and helpful and we could check in early after a long drive to Lakeland, which we definitely appreciated.
The accommodation was perfect. Clean, very well equipped, a lovely comfy King Size bed. It was very peaceful and close to the lake, for morning walks with our dog.
The split air condition units were absolutely fabulous, and kept the accommodation lovely and cool. The shower had lots of hot water and a very welcome powerful pressure. It was so comfortable and peaceful. It also had a very comfortable blue bean bag, that was huge for relaxing on. We felt very at home and welcomed, and very much appreciated the welcoming bottles of wine, coffee, and water.
We would love to stay again when we’re in Lakeland 😊"

Nice, quiet and peaceful neighborhood to take my service dog on walks. Lastly, the bed was extremely comfortable! We always try to book a place with a king and this was by far the most comfortable, best sleep I’ve gotten in a while! Will definitely use again if down in Lakeland!"

Stayed with kids","The bungalow was so cute and perfect for what we needed it for. My daughter had a dance competition at the RP Funding Center which was only 4 minutes away. There were plenty of little restaurants within walking and short driving distance. The home was clean and had plenty of space. There were full size bottles of shampoos, conditioners and bodywashes, plenty of towels and rags, cleaning supplies, and extra sheets. The kitchen was fully stocked with those extras you might not think to bring but need such as sugar, salt, pepper, etc. The kids had fun swinging on the tree swing he had in his front yard and he didnt mind them using it. Such a beautiful little old town feel. Wish we would have been in town for longer to enjoy it more. Thank you!!"

Every Saturday morning is the Farmer's Market uptown. We cannot express how much we enjoyed our stay."

Stayed with a pet","If you are looking for place that is pet friendly, impeccably clean, safe and a place to stay with walkable streets filled with quaint homes and serenity surroundings, then this is the place for you. There is outside seating in the yard to enjoy with company. There were so many places for us to walk our dog and he loved it! The beautiful house was only a short five-minute walk to Lake Morton with all of its bird life...swans, ducks and more! So many of the homes in the neighborhood are 100-year-old historic places and were absolutely charming. We met people on the sidewalks who treated us like we were part of the neighborhood. We were moments away from art museum, library, downtown dining, the Saturday Farmers Market, movie theater, shopping and entertainment.
Stephen was available to answer questions, make suggestions, and attentive to needs.
A great place to spend a day, a week or a month! You can't go wrong with this one."

Stayed over a week","As a DPT student I needed to secure housing for my rotation at LRH. I struck gold with Stephen’s listing. Unfamiliar with Lakeland, I needed somewhere with parking, workspace, privacy, peace and quiet given my busy schedule and student budget. The place is much bigger than it looks online. Plenty of space for indoor workouts in either the living or bedroom, huge TV, clean bathroom with great water pressure, Fully equipped kitchen with everything mentioned in the listing. Cozy and charming across the board. Surrounding area is idyllic, with the public library, historical district, restaurants, etc. within a 5-10 minute walk. Of course, Lakeland has lakes, and they’re beautiful. Running around Morton and Hollingsworth became part of my routine and the neighborhood is lush in nature and suburban architecture. Above all, Stephen is a phenomenal host. I had a 4 hour drive to the place and he waited around to meet face to face and help me get settled in. He has my highest recommendation."

Stayed with a pet","It was a true pleasure to stay at Stephen‘s bungalow. He was very communicative on the day of check-in and went above and beyond giving me advice on transportation to the concerts I was going to that weekend. The bungalow is a dream. Very cozy and easy to settle into, and I truly appreciate that he has dressers and closets available to the guest. Often when I have rented an Airbnb there is very little storage for my things. Stephen took good care of providing amenities, such as shampoo, condiments, and he even went as far to have both red and white wine, coffee creamer, filtered water, snacks, and even a small stick of butter!
Little touches like that go along way in making a guest feel special.
The location of the house is fantastic - it is just up the street from a beautiful lake and just a few blocks away from restaurants, stores, and downtown Lakeland.
Finding this bungalow was a real treat, and I highly recommend a stay there to anyone. I hope to be back up and visit again soon."

The kitchen had everything I needed and it was amazing to have this opportunity. It was so nice to provide a ""little home away from home."" experience. Stephen checked in often and always asked if I needed anything and I really appreciated that communication.

Stephen is a wonderful host who clearly enjoys giving his guests a great experience.

Stayed with kids","Wow! Just a perfectly wonderful stay, from start to finish, top to bottom. The location is quintessentially Lakeland. No vehicle needed; once you exit this warm and well appointed auxiliary residence, it's a convenient trip to any number of noteworthy Lakeland landmark locations-Lake Morton, Lake Hollingsworth, Hollis Gardens, Munn Park and downtown Lakeland, the recently revived Dixieland area, Florida Southern College and its world class collection of Frank Lloyd Wright-designed architectural...the list could go on and on.
We stayed a month, and, if it were up to me, we would've stayed many months more. Being a dog friendly property in a dog friendly neighborhood that's located in a dog friendly city meant our 5 year old Dalmatian-labradlor (Dalmador? Labratian?) had as enjoyable of a time as we did.
Along with being an active, well-respected member of his community, and a snazzy dresser, the host is exceptional in his thoughtfulness, expedient in his communication, courteous in his presence (his main residence is adjacent to the stand alone AirBnB), knowledgeable about the area, and exceedingly receptive to suggestions.
If you're on the fence over a Central Florida destination, don't be. Do yourself a favor and book the stay here. Since I moved to Florida in 2015, major media outlets have consistently ranked Lakand as one of the best places to live (in the entire USA). And, for me, having lived in several fabulous cities, (from Chicago, IL to Portland, OR) I wouldn't hesitate to place Lakeland at the very top for its quality of life. It's authentic. It's energetic. It's engaged and it engages. And this property is the perfect entryway to the idyllic Lakeland life.
Perfectly sized for the individual traveler, a couple, or a small family (maybe even a doggo or two).
Other, sometimes overlooked, opportunities to make this listing your 'home base'...
▪︎ Orlando theme park-based vacations? ✅️
▪︎ Gulf Coast beach trips? ✅️
▪︎ Space Coast outings? ✅️
And make sure you let the host know ""Jonathan sent you""!"

Stayed with a pet","Having travelled extensively over these past 6 months, and with lodging accomodations running the gamut from activity-filled resorts, extended stay hotels, roadside motels, and a multifarious array of short term owner offered properties, I have enjoyed, what seems like a lifetime's worth of travel related experiences. And, paramount of all amongst these lessons is what attributes (to me) make for the 'perfect' stay. While this mix of amenities and features, provisions and acoutrements, may differ dramatically amongst travelers, I am very confident when I say this:
Stephen's listing will provide you with a stay as perfect as it gets.
This comfortable, well provisioned space, which is amply sized, impeccably located, dutifully attended, and proudly offered shines as a beacon of hospitality amongst a sea of souped up toolsheds, which (while apropos and acceptable for a great many instances) lack the composition and character that this guest house intrinsically displays upon arrival.
Do yourself a favor when in Central Florida and go see for yourself. But, I'd recommend doing so expeditiously, or else, you may find that the author of this review and his family have booked everything available .
An abbreviated ""highlight reel"" (things that really resonated with us):
● Not only was the house immaculately clean upon our arrival, the host provided every cleaning supply and tool imaginable, which we gladly made use of (when traveling with a 5 year old boy and a 5 year old Dalmatian-Labrador mix, this type of host forethought is a gamechanger)
● There is no lack of water pressure in the shower, and the water temperature heats up very quickly.
● The air conditioning blows cold and strong, efficiently and effectively cooling tne whole place using 2 Samsung minisplit systems, both of which are jam packed with user options and are remote control operated.
And the pièce(s) de résistance....
● Fully stocked and thoroughly supplied kitchen? Definitely! No shortage of host-provided flatware, silverware, drinkware, and serviceware!
Extra neat bonus finds: a digital toaster and 4 different types of Ziploc baggies - now, that's a host that really cares!
My entire family- 2 adults (human), one 5 year old (human), and one 5 year old (Labrador-Dalmatian mix) all scored this listing as ""the perfect stay"".
(especially the dog...he liked the ample squirrel population for recreation and nearby green spaces for relief)"

The cottage's street is lined with beautiful moss trees and a view of the lake--a pretty place to come ""home"" to each day. The kitchen was well stocked with all things needed for cooking, a Keurig for coffee as well as a full size refrigerator. There's a full list of suggestions on what to do including weekly events and options for laundry. And if you ever want to hang outside for a bit, there's a darling patio with furniture right outside the doorstep.

Madison has looked after all the perks that anyone could ask for, she hosts for your pets, dogs and cats and prepared your visit even if you forgot something she'll make it available.
the home has a very large fence in yard that's great for your pets to run and roam freely.
Madison even provides protection covers for her furniture from your pets.
Everything you would need back home she provided, from cooking to cleaning and laundry facilities.
I would give this home 10 stars if they allowed it.
Definitely coming back next year, it's in the best location in Florida. Centered between Orlando and Tampa or only takes about an hour to get to either side of Florida.

Madison was great, very friendly and responsive. Rules and instructions were very clear and house was kept very clean and in order. Huge backyard in a nice and quiet neighborhood. My family and I will absolutely use again when we make another trip to Florida."

Both the front and the back of the home are double entryways, which is a really nice safety feature when your pets are in an unfamiliar environment. Thank you Madison, this was the most comfortable and relaxed I have felt with my dogs in a vacation home."

Stayed with a pet","Pro’s
- Very clean
- Very cute and decorated well
- Large fenced in backyard for pets
- Lots of extra little touches for pets (treats, poop bags, toys, etc)
- Beds were comfortable
- Close to everything we needed including shops and restaurants
- Plenty of off-street parking
Con’s
- The house was well taken care of outside, neighborhood was mixed
- Getting into the house was tricky, host did give instructions but the 8 digit code for the sunroom door was too long to ever remember. Then before you could get into the house, you had to get into a key box to retrieve the keys. The laundry room also needs the same key as the front door to unlock it. Not hard to do, just kind of pain because of the extra added steps
*I am a nightshift nurse, so for me the sheer blinds and curtains let it a TON of light during the day. Probably won’t bother most, but just incase anyone likes it dark too."

Madison was also responsive and communicative throughout the stay. There is also a binder with tons of local recommendations and helpful info about the house and area, which was a nice touch. We would definitely stay here again if we visit the Lakeland area in the future!"

It was absolutely perfect especially since we needed to stay an extra night, Madison was very accommodating. It was easy. Everything was there, I've been to some houses that really skipped out on some basic amenities but she even had the spice cabinet stocked. the backyard was perfect for our dog to run around and it was nice and cool inside for us afterwards. I'd definitely stay here again should we need to be in town for work in the future."

Stayed with kids","I can’t recommend staying here for 2 reasons.
First, the headboard in one of the bedrooms fell down. We found that it was hung on the wall with large picture hangers and tape. There were no screws and no anchors. It was unsafe. Thankfully, no one was hurt. I sent a message and photo to the host but she did not respond. The next day, she sent another message asking for “positive feedback.” She never mentioned the headboard. I’ve had minor problems in other airbnbs before but I never had a host that wouldn’t respond at all to an issue.
Also, the floors were very dirty. Someone had swept but hadn’t mopped in a long time. Our feet and socks were black on the bottom after walking around the house.
Otherwise, the house is in a great location and looked like the photos when we arrived besides some very minor issues - like a rip in the couch, broken nightstand drawer and missing faceplate on one of the outlets."

Stayed with kids","Mariana's home was the perfect fit for my family and I. The apartment is spacious, clean, and has a lot of little touches that make it feel like a home. The pictures really do not do it justice. There are 2 bedrooms, one at the front and a slightly larger one at the rear of the home, with a spacious and open area with the kitchen and living room in between. The couch is huge and comfortable, great for everyone to stretch out and watch TV in the evenings. There is a master bath attached to the rear bedroom, which was also very convenient. The nicely lit outdoor seating was a plus as well. The location was great, being just down the road from Florida Ave and a short walk to Lake Hollingsworth. The lake has a 3 mile walking/jogging trail that runs all the way around it. There is also a really nice coffee shop/commons area just across Florida Ave. On top of this, Mariana is a friendly and attentive host. I would definitely recommend her home!"

Really enjoyed the privacy, quiet, and parking garage.
Thank you Mariana. I would definitely stay here again when in the area. Highly recommend the in-depth walking tour at the Frank Lloyd Wright Visitor Center, as well as First Fridays in the nearby downtown area."

A stocked kitchen with a large fridge allowing you to cook whatever you please. Bring your work with you if you please because you will have a great wifi connection for calls. You will NOT be disappointed with your stay here!"

The house was very convenient to grocery shopping, coffee shops and bakeries, and is in a very walkable, historic neighborhood. We were very surprised at how close it was to a couple local lakes - Lake Morton and Lake Hollinsworth. Both lakes were wonderful for site seeing and people watching. Overall, my wife and I, and our friends, were very satisfied with our stay here."

The host responded quickly when we had an issue with the water. She contacted the city and relayed what she found out in a timely manner. The city took care of the issue quickly. She even dropped off bottled water for us which we didn’t need to use. We would definitely stay here again."

The kitchen had all the necessities for us to cook all our meals for the time that we were there. The instructions for coming into the property were very accurate and easy to follow. The finishing touches on the property made the stay feel extra special. The Wi-Fi was perfect so we were able to get lots of work completed during our work retreat. The location is in a historic part of town with easy access to a coffee shop and places to walk. We walked over to Lake Hollingsworth and Florida Southern College for a self guided tour of the Frank Lloyd Wright architecture. The host was available and responded with immediate communication. I highly recommend this stay."

The space worked well for us, the location was great and we had nearly everything we needed! I would just add a bottle of water for guests upon arrival (after traveling long day) and regular shampoo & conditioner rather than 2-n-1. The water pressure in the shower was really nice. I stayed in another Airbnb in the area that had no water pressure and it was not pleasant. I also liked the parking pad and garage access. And the Keurig. Big fan of the Keurig although for some reason I didn’t use it this time. We were on the run - there are so many things to do in the area. But you can relax here if that is your schedule and sink into the comfy sofa. 💫"

We used to go everyday to a different lake, the neighbors are very friendly, always with a smile in there faces.
Near the house there are also some good restaurants that completed the whole experience in the neighborhood.
Also we were lucky to meet the owners of the house, Mariana and Federico, a lovely couple with a beautiful little girl, who supported us in every way they could so we could feel comfortable. Total thanks to you. My recommendation is to book this place as soon as you see it available, because I know it's already full for a couple of months in advance, and it totally worth it.
We really had a wonderful vacation in this house ans we will definitely come back SOON!"

Stayed a few nights",If I had to label Abel’s place I would call it “Attention to detail”. He has thought of everything. The bathroom and kitchen had everything a guest would need had they forgot something or just wanted something extra. We loved the front porch. The beds were very comfortable. The back yard was relaxing. We attended a dance competition at the RP funding center and came back many times throughout the days just to relax and unwind. We travel for competitions frequently and this house is at the very top of of places we have ever visited. It felt like home.

Stayed with a pet","Abel's place was nice and had a very nice autumn TV screen saver with delicate jazz in the background. After complementing her about these things on our wedding night, she first congratulated us on our marriage, then immediately followed up with a request for us to take the trash to the street the next morning. Sorry, not our responsibility. Next time, we'll be sure to bring our bathroom cleaning supplies too, if that's preferred.
The house was good, although we almost ran out of toilet paper, the bed wasn't as comfortable as we would have liked, and the bathroom is so tight, it's almost impossible to not soak the floor when getting into the shower.
My new bride used to be a super host and always leaves places cleaner than most, and have had reviews complementing her on this. The request for the trash definitely put her in a foul mood for a little while. Checkout time was a little on the early side too."

Stayed a few nights","The cutest hidden gem! We absolutely loved and enjoyed every minute of our stay. The home totally embodies everything that the charming city of Lakeland represents and offers!
As you walk into the home and open the door you are immediately greeted by beautiful classical music. The layout of the kitchen is very open and functional. The couch was large and perfect for hosting a family. The decor was everything. The beds were actually one of the most comfortable beds I’ve slept in.
This home was also equipped to entertain your family outside.. there was a nice fire place and tree swing, multiple seating areas as well as a large outside eating table under a pagoda style gazebo.
Best part of the experience was that hosts showed incredibly thoughtful and high level hospitality! They left a personalized welcome card with cute message with our names. (I’m so bummed I forgot to take the card with me I wanted to keep it for my scrapbook)
Well done, we will be booking again! 10 out of 10!"

On the way there we didn’t have a place to stay yet I searched & Abel’s cottage looked like what we were looking for. I can’t thank them enough for taking us in on a last minute notice & their hospitality. They went beyond our expectations! As we arrived into this cozy cottage we walked into beautiful music playing, flowers, & a sweet card. It was such a welcoming feeling. God sent! Everything was immaculate! Beautiful courtyard as well, which we enjoyed immensely. Listening to the fountain & swinging. Also, all the extra things such as toiletries, coffee,chocolates, etc. We asked for recommendations for dinner & they were on point. They were very quick to responding. We didn’t want to leave yet hope to visit again. This is the best cottage we’ve stayed at & I would highly recommend all to stay.

Backyard well lit with a small Weber grill, covered outdoor seating and fire pit. Indoors was spotless. We were there for our son's wedding so, although it wasn't part of our original plan, we had his best man use the spacious kitchen to prepare the deserts for the event. Because it was in the week between Christmas and New Years the house was decorated with holiday lighting. Upon entry we were met with a Yule log on the TV screen, holiday music, electric candle light, and holiday theme decor. We are familiar with Lakeland on day trips, but this was the first time we had an opportunity to experience it from a living point of view. Highly recommend this host if you need a little space and place to relax."

This house was super clean, was in a very quiet and safe neighborhood, close to downtown and shopping areas. The newly renovated bathroom was super nice and the water in the house was always hot. The house had a lot stocked for us when we got there: tons of spices, flour, plastic bags, silverware, plates, and there was even a fully stuffed care package basically in the bathroom! Had shampoos, lotions, makeup remover pads, toothbrushes, toothpaste, razors, and so much more. There wasn't a full grill in the backyard but there was a charcoal grill which was super easy to use and all you had to do was buy the charcoal of your choice from the store. Anytime we had to text or call Abel, he was always quick to respond and answered all of our questions. If you need a clean, safe place to stay in the area that is close to a lot of things, this is the place!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a very nice little home, well designed and homey. Very convenient to everything and comfortable. There are two things that you might want to know if you are going to be staying here. 1 ) There is a very strong fragrance when you walk into the home, it wasn’t a bad scent but a bit overwhelming. This comes from two people who use fragrance free soaps and pretty much everything else. To some, many, this might not be important.
The home has a very nicely remodeled bathroom. However, if you are a larger person it will be tight for you.
A one last thing, the home has a smart thermostat which is controlled by Abel. He was very responsive to changing the temperature but you did not have the ability to change it yourself."

Stayed with kids","This house is everything promised. It's cute, it's convenient to attractions in Lakeland, and it has a lot of little touches and extras that make it more than just another place to say. The owners were very polite and very communicative, and this was the perfect place to rest our feet and relax after a long day of walking around the sights in Lakeland."

Stayed with kids","I don’t even know where to begin. So many details we loved about this place. The hosts have gone above and beyond to make this an incredible home. Everything we needed and then some. Comfortable, clean, perfect amount of space. Loved the brick road, the houses decorated with Christmas lights on the drive up to the house. Fenced in yard. Our dog loved it. Large windows. The outdoor space with the stringed lights and the hanging hammock chair. The amazing front porch chair I actually napped in one afternoon. We fully took advantage of this place. Felt instantly like home. It was so nice to not have to make an extra trip to the grocery that first night after a ten hour drive to get there. The kitchen had enough goodies to get us started. Took our son to Legoland which is only a 40 minute drive away. We spent a week here and it was the perfect start to our Florida vacation. We were a little sad to leave. Could totally live in this house with its lovely historic charm. Definitely a gem! We hope to come bank. Fell in love with the house and Lakeland."

Group trip","This darling historic home has been remodeled beautifully! It is centrally located within the historic district of Lakeland. So the beautiful gas lamps in the street, the older homes surrounding, and close to beautiful Lake Hunter! The beds are comfortable with dark curtains for late sleepers. The kitchen is well appointed and well stocked for the Keurig and specialty teas. The backyard is set up with lights and a table that seats six for outdoor dining on the patio. We had a lovely time and plan to come back in the future!"

Stayed with kids",Wow! This home is easily one of the best Airbnb‘s I have ever booked. That is saying a lot because I have utilized Airbnb numerous times. The host was very attentive and the home is absolutely lovely with lots of charm! There were Christmas decorations and fully stocked cupboards to ensure that our stay was comfortable. There were even fresh flowers in the bathroom and in the kitchen. The fence back yard had a lovely seating area with market lights which created a cozy outdoor environment. The bathroom is absolutely beautiful! The house was very well laid out and was a great space for us to relax and enjoy each other‘s company. The front porch is so cute and so welcoming with a gorgeous view of the nearby lake. Lots of historic charm on a brick street! Definitely will be staying at this home again in the future.
