Stayed a few nights","Absolutely perfect stay ! Perfect location to Bing and downtown ! Beautiful home and very clean - fun and vibrant ! Very spacious with 4 bedrooms and 5 beds! We recommend to future Grad families ! You went above and beyond with snacks and lotions .
Large kitchen to cook in with All of the necessities ! Only hesitation is it’s not easily accessible for elderly with issues with climbing stairs/steps . If toddler, bring a resistant gate for second floor stairs. Affordable for Graduation weekend/parent weekend or weekend getaway to Binghamton."

Stayed over a week","Great Two Month Stay!!! I believe that when the AIRBnB platform first started, it was homes like this that they envisioned. Nice homes, well equipped for long term stays, along with VERY responsive and responsible owners. The nice oversize TV in the Master BR was an added plus. BONUS; The fun artwork and colours of the interior ensured it wasn't your normal cookie cutter stay.
So If you're visiting the Binghamton area, or need a family friendly place near the Finger Lakes, this is it, look no farther.....Great Stay!!!"

Stayed a few nights","I've stayed at Yamilet's place x4. I've enjoyed my stays initially, not as time progressed. I continued to book with her because she fixed issues, showing promise, but was the same each stay. Honestly, I'm not looking to vilify the host. However, the most important thing I'll share from this experience: upon arrival should you book this place, ensure you advocate for yourselves as far as cleanliness is concerned. Be mindful of hairs (from eyelashes to long strands to pet fur) on sheets and in bathroom spaces between guests, as well as cleanliness of high-touch areas and carpets. The host, though very communicative, continued to accept my booking requests though I'm ""problematic"", but tried to get me to cancel last minute because I continued to voice issues regarding the level of cleaning after check-in whenever she asks how my stay's going. This was my final stay, so she won't have to ""shutdown [her] listing while [she's] solving the problem"" (of changing 'cleaning service')."

Stayed a few nights","Yamilet was an amazing host, super helpful and quick to answer. The space was exactly as said in the description. She has a makeshift wall up separating her area downstairs from the stairs to get up to the upstairs apartment where you stay, totally separate and doesn’t feel like you’re together whatsoever. Everything was super clean no complaints. Little bit too far of a walk from downtown, especially in december weather, but only a 5 minute uber or car ride and ubers are generally inexpensive. Definitely recommended staying here if you’re looking for a quiet time to enjoy downtown bing with a great host."

Stayed a few nights","we loved our rental. it was lovely and clean. Yamilet was an amazing host, and everything was perfect. she let us know where everything was, and she answered any questions we had. The AC was a bit of an odd situation. Since it was upstairs from her home, she controlled it and not us. The circulation of the air was not that great. However, she had two fans to help circulation, and that helped, and when I asked her to please turn the AC on, she did not hesitate! I really appreciated that! she was ver accommodating, and that meant a lot to us. We had good sleep, and our mornings were great. it was nice, we did not tour the area since we went for a wedding. But she was willing to help with any info about the town.
I definitely recommend her place!"

Stayed a few nights","Yamilet was a very friendly and communicative host (despite being out of the country for her son’s wedding!). As soon as we checked in, she messaged to find out if we wanted the AC on (she controls it remotely) - it was an awful humid/hot day so we definitely did! But it didn’t cool off the place, even after 4-5 hours. When I messaged her about it, she called someone from maintenance to check the unit and bring us an extra fan. He came quickly even though it was pretty late at night by then. Even though it was a sticky night, I really appreciated everything she did to try to fix the situation."

Stayed a few nights","This is a delightful place to stay. We hope to go back again. It is maintained in excellent condition. It's the upstairs of a townhouse, and Yamilet lives downstairs. She responds quickly and cheerfully whenever we needed something, e.g. turning the A/C up or down or replenishing the TP supply.
There is a front room with a separate huge bedroom like a super hotel suite, great for couples where one is a night owl and the other an early bird, and a spacious bathroom. One thing to be aware of that took me a while to figure out--the tub/shower is plumbed backwards, with hot to the right and cold to the left (the opposite of what is printed on the knob).
The neighborhood seemed quiet, and I had no concerns about parking the car at the end of the block."

With a short walk in the neighborhood, however, I didn't feel safe as a woman traveling alone... (my very personal experience). So if you travel alone, drive or travel in the group. 😊"

Stayed one night","I loved staying at Yamilet’s place, which was so cozy and quiet that night after a long day of driving. I wasn’t sure where to park as there our no parking anytime signs on her street on both sides but Yamilet readily gave suggestions including parking on her grass for the evening (it was real late when I got in and was exhausted and didn’t really feel like looking). My daughter and I stayed one night when I came to pick her up from college. It was a quick 10 minute ride from Bing U. Yamilet was very accommodating, the place was neat and clean. More daughter said the couch/bed wasn’t that comfortable but my bed (a king bed) was INCREDIBLY comfortable and it was big enough for her to sleep with me. Well stocked. And is a steal, on my opinion for the price."

Stayed one night","With all her enthusiastic reviews, I was surprised at how UN-welcoming her check-in instructions were -- but the reviews were correct: she was just as sweet and kind as could be. I'm thinking she must have, unfortunately, gotten burned with guests having visitors and taking all the snacks. (We've stayed in LOTS of AirBnBs and have never seen a charge for the snacks provided; we seldom take them anyway.) The king-size bed was perfectly comfortable, but it only had two pillows & we'd have appreciated extra. (She'd probably have provided them if we had asked, but we didn’t want to bother her after we returned from dinner.) There were two bath towels & a hand towel provided; we didn't need a shower after just driving the whole day, but a washcloth would have been nice. (Again, we did not ask.) We were happy that there was a fan in the room & a box of tissues by the basin. The driveway was just long enough for one car, and the check-in instructions said to use it just for unloading and park down the street (so she could get her car out of the garage to get to work early in the morning.) However, when we asked about safety (as we have LOTS of stuff in the car) she was kind enough to park on the grass so we could park in the driveway. We'd definitely recommend Yamilet's place."

But from the moment I stepped inside, I was greeted with a sense of warmth.
It is a newly renovated apartment and you can tell that it was designed to give a perfect balance between modern elegance and cozy comfort.
The apartment had spacious rooms and necessary amenities to cater for a large family.
The host was super responsive and went above and beyond to ensure a memorable stay.

Mr. Mofasal was excellent about communicating with me and even checked in via email during the stay. The only small issue was that there are some minor repairs that are needed (i.e. door handle, porch door hydrolic pin, vent cover securing, blind securing etc.). All of these are very small items that can be put back in place but can be frustrating when looking to open the doors, blinds etc. Appreciate the stay and would recommend especially for anyone with a dog. Thank you Md!"

Great shower, all the furniture felt nice and cozy. The pots and pans were also great. There was even a few spices, some coffee, coffee creamer and filters which was super helpful. The instructions made it super easy to get in. I wanted to extend my stay by one day, and they were super accommodating and made it happen within a few minutes.
Well worth the price. Compared to local hotels, this place was a steal. The loft was really tastefully designed, too. You can really tell Owen and co have put a good deal of thought into it. The freezer even had some ice which was convenient. The balcony was also pretty cool. Nice functional hammock, and a good spot to people watch during the day time. There's a bit of commotion outside, but that's to be expected when staying in a city. Went above and beyond my expectations.
Loved it."

I was a little startled at first to realize there was a city bus hub and Greyhound station across the small parking lot but there was no problem. The apartment was quiet, people at the bus stop were respectful, it ended up being fun to sit on the amazing deck and people watch while relaxing and enjoying the evening.
There was easy parking in the parking lot. The electronic key pads worked well. Owen happened to be walking past as I was going into the apartment and stayed to chat to make sure I had no problems entering the apartment. He was very friendly and I felt like I could reach out for any reason and he/his team would be very responsive and they were.
The decor is funky and hip, love it. Wonderful loft vibe. The location is perfect. So many cool restaurants, theaters, galleries, etc. in close proximity. Easy ten minute drive to Binghamton U. Would definitely stay again."

The only big issue was that there was only enough hot water for one person and had to wait for a few hours till shower gets hot again. The host didn’t know why.

Just steps from Rec Park which is a great park with a historic carousel and an amazing playground. The house had some fun surprises, being located in the neighborhood where Rod Serling was born and raised. Beds were comfortable, floors were quiet, shower was strong and hot. I would love to stay again. Dianne was always responsive and offered thoughtful amenities, like a basket of essentials at minimal cost for anything one may have forgotten. Overall a very enjoyable stay."

We appreciated all of the thought that went into making sure that we had everything that we needed. She provided yard games, DVDs, board, games, and other activities to keep families entertained. The backyard is gated, which is an added bonus with a toddler. The residence is located in a nice neighborhood that is walkable. It is close to a lot of stores and restaurants. Most importantly, the beds were comfortable! And all linens, towels, and toilet paper/paper towels were provided. We will be staying here again when we return to Binghamton."

There were many different areas where one could have stayed within the house without everyone being on top of each other. The kitchen was a little small, but we ended up only being two people so it was fine."

We let her know that we would be getting in late, and when we arrived lights were on at the door and inside to welcome us. Dianne had decorated for Christmas, and even the Christmas tree lights were on. Every room was cozy and comfortable. She provided everything we needed to enjoy our stay which, unfortunately, was only one night. We would definitely love to come back again and stay longer."

A beautiful park is two blocks away.
That said, be aware that this is an old house, which means that things might not work perfectly. If you stay there in the summer, the place gets very hot. There are AC units in the windows of the two bedrooms, but if you cannot sleep with the AC on, keep in mind that might get really hot.

Their place was in a safe neighborhood with its own guest driveway. It was very clean, stocked with everything we could possibly have needed plus additional touches (including fresh flowers and homemade baked goods). I would highly recommend this location."

Stayed a few nights","Sally and Marty’s place was better than I could have imagined. The photographs portray exactly what their place looks like. The cleanliness was above and beyond. There were homemade DELICIOUS treats as well as great coffee and breakfast items. We enjoyed cooking during our stay and had everything we needed in the kitchen. Sally and Marty were very willing to lend anything else we might have needed in the kitchen, toiletries, etc. Such a lovely couple and we had a wonderful chat upon arrival where we were given a list of plenty of events in the area as well as places to check out during our stay. We went to the farmers market, an Irish pub they recommended, as well as the local brewery. Truly an amazing experience and weekend getaway. We will definitely book again in the future. Location was easy to find and parking was great. Thank you so much!"

Little nice things like the occasional treat left for us on an entry table, or fresh magazines from the house to read. They keep a fantastic yard and home, and are in an excellent location. The room is simple, but well equipped and maintained, and has a nice modern feel to it. There's enough gear in the kitchen to make a reasonable array of dishes - pots and pans wise. And the owners are always helpful and considerate."

The unit was well kept and clean and the snacks/food was great to get started with instead of having to grocery shopping as soon as I got there.

We arrived much later than expected, but they stayed up and graciously showed us around the house and where everything was. Afterwards Sally sent an email about different places in Binghampton that was really helpful. The house was very clean, warm, and well stocked with lots of goodies (eggs, coffee, granola bars, fruit, etc) and essential things that one always forgets (shampoo, toothpaste, etc). They also brought over some delicious zucchini bread and cookies. They even had champagne for the New Year, but sadly we were too tired to take advantage of that, but we really appreciated it. It was a very relaxing was to spend New Years."

Stayed about a week","Sally & Marty are wonderful hosts and go far above and beyond to make sure guests have everything they need and then some! They were both very kind, welcoming, always available when we needed them to be - yet we had our privacy - they truly made us feel ""at home.""
The attached apartment is exactly as they've described it with a private entrance and separate driveway from the main house which was nice. The entire space was spotless, the AC cooled the place nicely, the kitchen was fully stocked with more than we could have imagined, the bed was super comfy (bonus!) and we had plenty of room to move around!
We opted to stay here because we were traveling for work and it was close to where we needed to be. We are so happy we found Sally & Marty's place because now we know where we will stay every year when we return! We feel like when we return we will be visiting our new friends :)"

Given the limited inventory of Airbnb options in Binghamton, this place was an excellent value for its location. I particularly appreciated the clean washer and dryer, making laundry a breeze. Highly recommended!"

Stayed a few nights","Unfortunately had to cancel this stay only a few hours in.
It was easy to find and the host was responsive to requests for a fragrance free stay as possible.
But when I arrived, I noticed that the back door deadbolt had been removed from the door and the hole was left in its place.
The door needed maintenance for security, and it was already evening when this was noticed.
The host didn’t refund but Airbnb was responsive to our concerns."

From the moment I walked in I felt a warm welcome. The house is soooooo beautiful and peaceful. The hosts Rob and Merrie are angels with loving energy 10 out of 10 I do recommend. If I am ever in Binghamton I would definitely book again. 😇

but I must say Robert made my shared experience an unbelievable and exceptional and beautiful experience. my wife was super happy. she picked vegetables from the garden and cooked breakfast for all of us. Robert loaned his car to me while my car had to be repaired and he took me to the repair shop. A lifesaver, possibly.
every night after dinner I had a friendly chat with Robert and her other guests. it was a very friendly environment."

Stayed a few nights","I can not recommend staying here no matter how attractive the low price may be. The hosts do not adhere to their own ""quiet time from 8pm-9am"" rule. Shrieking laughter and raucous banter kept me awake until midnight. The room also faces a noisy six-lane highway, so don't expect it to get quiet even after the party downstairs simmers down. The curtains are thinner than the half-ply toilet paper provided in the bathroom, so flood lights from the food & fuel rest stop across the street shine into the room all night long. But the most troubling part of my stay came with Rob and Merrie got into an hour-long heated argument right outside of my door over whether or not it was worth the effort to clean and change the used linens and towels after a guest had checked out. Ultimately, Merrie won the argument and they decided that they would simply straighten out and re-fold the unwashed things for the next guest to use. Gross! There are other listings in the same price range and I regret not picking one of those instead. You've been warned."

House was very clean, easy to follow instructions, response to any inquiries. Mostly quiet, but a really cozy house. For progressives, if you want to stay comfortable avoid politics (losing a star for my comfort and boundaries being crossed)."

Stayed a few nights","The home was very comfortable based on surroundings. A few reasons we gave the home a 4: 1) Temp - The upstairs was very warm. In order to make the upstairs comfortable for sleeping we would be very cold downstairs. The rooms did have window AC but they did not cool the rooms enough and the windows were painted shut. 2)The kitchen wasn't as stocked as we're used to. We needed a bowl to make a salad and ran to Target to pick one up. 3) Parking was a little tight. 4)The 1/2 bath was very small and could not be used for anything other than intended purpose.
Other than that the host was extremely responsive, the house was very clean. Although we have our own Netflix account it was convenient to have it provided. The host provided a variety of snacks. This was the easiest checkout of all the places we've stayed. Thank you Binghomes."

Group trip","We have stayed in several homes. This home was perfect for us. We walked in and the owner had k cups for the coffee maker, condiments in the fridge, even instant oatmeal and snack bars - but even more than that a bottle of red and white wine was left for us. The kitchen was complete pots and fry pans, all utensils were all included. The only two things missing was a spatula and a pair of tongs. Considering everything they did to make this house a perfect home for guest it was incredible.
The night before we got there we were in a very noisy hotel, I had no sleep. Well the bedroom was so comfortable I slept 10 hours. The other bedrooms were just as comfortable.
The living room even made you feel at home, we even found a deck of cards and books for reading.
I would recommend this home to anyone visiting Binghamton, you will be extremely happy -we were."

Stayed a few nights","Alexis's place was as advertised. Alexis herself was very prompt in responding to us and even reached out to us to check on us. She was friendly, professional and helpful with each encounter.
Getting in was a little challenge for us. We were not familiar with this particular style of entry code lock and we were initially confused. (For the record, it is the front door and after you touch the dark area around the lock, the numbers appear.) The lock worked well and every time on the first attempt.
The neighborhood: after you book and see exactly where the street is, you will see it is quite close to a highway. The street is quiet despite the location.
Vestal itself is a booming suburban area with just about any store you would like to shop at and many chain and local restaurants in an under 10 minute drive.

The attention to detail was evident in every corner, from the carefully chosen furnishings to the calming color palette that added to the overall tranquility.
One of the standout aspects of our stay was the superb responsiveness and accommodation provided by our hosts. Amy went above and beyond to ensure our comfort and satisfaction, making us feel truly valued as guests. Any inquiries or requests were met with prompt and friendly responses, showcasing their commitment to providing an exceptional experience.
We enjoyed our stay and would love to return on our next visit to the area.

Walking distance to many bars and restaurants. We were visiting family. There is a bar next door so keep that in mind if you’re visiting on a weekend while college is in session. It didn’t bother us too much. Worth every penny. Will be contacting Roger when we come back to visit family again.

Stayed a few nights","For those Bing U. Parents who want an alternative to the crowded and very expensive hotels, this is an ideal location for your graduation weekend.
The apartment is very well set up, with nice sized 2 bedrooms and a very spacious loft size living/kichen/dining area. We brought an inflatable bed for the one child in our group, it was so easy to find a good spot for that.
Parking - one spot was provided and our other driver had no problem finding street parking.
The provided amenities were so helpful, one of our family was able to cook a delicious meal with the pots and pans provided.
The noise from downstairs restaurant/bar was loud but it was graduation weekend, after all. The location is a short walk across the bridge to the fun filled downtown area.
We had no trouble because we use noise blocking earbuds, or earplugs, or the helpfully provided white noise machine.
I highly recommend this apartment."

Walls are connected so you can sing along if you like...until 2am!!! Provided ear plugs and a sound machine should have given me a heads up though trust me, they don't help much at all.
I'm guessing that if anyone values their sleep, it's best you look elsewhere to stay."

Stayed a few nights","Clean and secure, with a locking lower door and another locking door at top of steps.
I’m not sure if the bar in the adjoining building is so loud other nights, but the listing should clearly state (and does not) that extremely loud (vibrating the walls) music and bar patrons outside until 3:30 in the morning on Friday and Saturday nights would make me look elsewhere for a rental. Supplying earplugs in a jar in one of the bedrooms is not helpful when the noise is so loud. This is no exaggeration. All night, DJ music and people screaming outside. Also there is oddly a window in the wall of the bedroom (toward the living room area) leaving no privacy as there is no curtain or blinding window."

Stayed a few nights","Roger's unit was clean, spacious and cozy. Stayed true to photos for the most part. Roger responded very quickly when contacted. My only two issues were how cold the apartment was - there was only one AC unit in the living room that provided heat, the bedrooms didn't have, had to leave the door open to let the warm air circulate best it could while trying not to turn the heat up too high. Also the noise thru the walls from the pub next door with the karaoke and other music events. The noise machine was a nice touch, helped somewhat. If you're an early-to-bed-early-to-rise type, esp for work, something to be mindful of. Otherwise, would consider booking again."

Stayed a few nights","The apartment is very clean, comfortable, and matched all expectations. The offstreet parking is nice and the apartment is easy to check into, and is located in a convenient area with many food options within walking distance. It’s been recently remodeled and has a nice AC/Heat unit. Roger also has some helpful information about the surrounding area and some neat history about the building.
The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five was because of the noisy bar next door. Evidently, Wednesday night is Karaoke night - I was able to sing along with the music and folks next door until about 1am. It was very loud. The white noise machine helps and was definitely appreciated but I wasn’t able to sleep until after the party next door calmed down. Thursday night was about as loud but once the bar closed there were folks revving loud car engines until around 2am. Some other reviews mentioned the noise but I wasn’t quite expecting it to be this loud and this late."

Our only concerns were that there was a bar next door that appeared to have live music, but there were earplugs in one room and a sound machine in the other. These were really considerate to have and probably helped all of us get a good nights sleep. The noise honestly probably wasn't enough to keep us up but still the fact that we had something to help us sleep was good.
Overall it was a really good place and really don't have anything bad to say about it."

Cons: The sofa was a worn, the fridge was missing holder barriers for the door, the paint in the bathroom was peeling off, a bit of a rough area. The most notable issue for us was that there was a club and under or nearby, plus the loud motorcycles on the Main Street that made sleep difficult for either of us on Saturday night. Not certain if this is the same on Sunday night or weekdays…but there were ear plugs, but it didn’t help us. If you’re one of those sound sleepers, then it’s not an issue—it was for us:("

Stayed with kids","The apartment itself is beautiful and a very cool loft. It was clean and nicely cared for. The area was also convenient to where we wanted to be. The area is quite noisy, so the white noise machine and ear plugs were a nice touch. We didn’t go to them, but the restaurants and bars next to the apartment seemed very popular and a lot of fun.
The instructions were still somewhat unclear about how to get to the actual apartment from the parking lot (a hand drawn map would help as the app for Maps just showed the apartment building as the parking lot). In addition, the AC worked great, but only in the living room. In order for the bedrooms to get cold air, the doors needed to be open which leaves no privacy. The one bedroom also has a large open window in front of the bed looking into the living room with no curtain, so privacy was a concern."

The kitchen had what we needed to cook our breakfast and the shower water was nice and hot. Check-in and checkout was easy. It is central to downtown Binghamton with a bunch of places to eat and drink. The location is above a bar and I read some people have concerns. We stayed on a Sunday and Monday night and there was zero noise. I would recommend Roger's place for your Binghamton visit.

Stayed a few nights","Bit of a mixed bag. Location was handy and I was glad of the off the road parking. Apartment is spacious and has most of the average amenities you might expect. However from reading the other reviews, I thought I came prepared for the noise. There were multiple people stomping up and down the stairs, holding loud conversations, slamming doors, banging into walls, at what seemed like every 15 minutes all night. The noise didn't seem to come from the pub but from the building I was in. This was confusing considering there was only one other apartment (as far as I could tell) and the stairwell had keypad access. I even wondered if the other folks were moving out in the middle of the night. When I finally checked at 4:30AM there was no moving van to be seen, only several people milling about outside. There was also a minor issue with the AC which meant it was turned off for the weekend. In fairness these issues would be hard to control for by the owner. But sadly I wouldn't rush back."

The only thing I would say is that it’s pretty loud at night, since it’s right above a club, but that’s not really on the host. I wanted to find a place and really didn’t pay attention. Roger was kind enough to leave earplugs in both bedrooms, which certainly helped!"

Stayed one night","This was our first Air B&B experience. Roger’s loft apartment was wonderful. It was very clean and comfortable, and we liked the decor. Bedrooms were cozy and comfortable. The central location was convenient. Check-in instructions were perfect. Parking was a bit tight in the rear of the building, but totally fine. The only drawback — and this was noted in many reviews — was the noise coming from the bar next door. The music was somewhat tolerable, but what kept us awake for most of the night was the loud talking and yelling from the bar patrons on the sidewalk just below the bedroom windows. This lasted until about 4 am, though the bar closed at 3. To be fair, the noise generated by the bar and its patrons is beyond Roger’s control. His apartment is absolutely lovely. I’m assuming the noise level isn’t nearly that bad during the week (we stayed over on a Saturday night). So if you value your sleep on the weekends, probably best to find a quieter location. We would stay here again, but only during the week. Feel badly writing that because the apartment is so nice. But just want to be fully transparent on the noise issue that, admittedly, the host cannot be blamed for."

Stayed a few nights","We visited Binghamton for just a weekend and Roger's loft was a perfect place to stay! Check-in was straight forward and the loft itself was clean and tidey. The location is only a block from downtown which was nice, however it did get fairly noisy during the night with the bar right next door. Overall, we had a nice stay!"

Stayed a few nights","Roger's place is an outstanding value!
My son and I came to town from Seattle for a memorial and to visit family for a whole week, and were very comfortable for the entire time. The apartment is spacious, clean, and had everything we needed. It's also in a great location, easy to get to anywhere.
Regarding the bar next door, I am a super light sleeper, so I came prepared. I did bring my sound machine, which i use every night at home, but that wasnt quite enough. What worked best for me was going to sleep with my earbuds in with my phone playing my favorite sleep app sound. Totally doable. I had little trouble falling to sleep, and only needed them for part of the night. Problem solved.
We consider ourselves lucky to have had Roger's place to stay at during our time in Binghamton, and truly hope its available the next time we are in town."

Stayed a few nights","First of all, communication is good, check in good, is a central location but on the first floor there is a bar, if you have work to do, they make a lot of noise, place wasnot
Clean properly, they used a dirty rag to clean, you will notice it on the refrigerator and kitchen, we have to clean and disinfect everything again, Dont forget to take fotos pictures when you arrive to have a proof and how do you left the apart before checkout, we clean the apartment again, we took a little time, and we forget one pan to wash it, they want to charge us $15 more for cleaning, I always take pictures and video"

Stayed one night","Stayed one night for Bing graduation weekend. Everything was as described. Nice, clean, comfortable apartment. Close to downtown restaurants.
If you are looking for groceries you will need to drive to a supermarket as there aren’t any within walking distance.
As others reviewers said, you will hear the music from the bar next door, but I didn’t think it was that bad. And the outside street noise might bother you if you are a light sleeper.
Otherwise, a great alternative to a hotel."

Stayed one night",Perfect for our short overnight stay in Binghamton! Check-in was super seamless and the apartment was as pictured. Only complaint is the bar next door is super loud and we could feel the bass from the music playing late at night. Otherwise everything else was great! I forgot something after my stay and Roger was super accommodating with having a friend go pick it up.

Stayed one night","Just as described and as expected. first, the place is every bit as it seems from the photos. great old loft feel but still warm and comfortable. Yes, you can hear the bar from time to time, but it really wasn't bad and if you've ever lived in the city, it's just what you expect. overall the place is clean, has everything you need for your stay, and is a great deal.
Second, Roger is a great host. his directions are spot on, check-in is a breeze and he's really responsive. if you're looking for a hip urban loft, this is a great place and is a short distance from everything."
