Group trip","Totally amazing home with all of the comforts & extras. Very clean! Super quiet! We've been Airbnb-ing 10 years & this was the best! Wish it hadn't rained so we could have enjoyed the outdoor porch, super homey! Great communication with Sheena & I'd hire her as a personal decorator! Loved our stay!"

The home was very clean ,cozy and peaceful
The front porch of the home was very peaceful and relaxing .
The game room is a nice touch for kids to stay entertained. The bedrooms were very comfortable. The Central air system worked very well and responsive. My stay at Sheena’s home was amazing and wish I could’ve stayed longer ."

Large bedroom with a very comfortable queen size bed, wifi, large tv, desk, comfortable chair, and bottled water in the room. Had use of the kitchen and refrigerator so I prepared breakfast and lunch, and just went out to dinner, with nice restaurants close by."

Stayed one night",Joel is an amazing guy. This was my second stay here at his place and it was great. He was accommodating and flexible with my check in/out times which was key for me. I was 36-37 weeks pregnant during my stay and he was out in the severe winter snow storm at 7:30am shoveling and salting outside making sure I was safe getting in and out of his place for my stay. The bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever been in- and being this far along in my pregnancy that is saying a lot! I will always choose to stay here if I need a place to stay in kalamazoo again!

Stayed one night",Hello! Joel‘s listing was the best money I’ve ever paid for in terms of an Airbnb. He was very communicative and allowed us to have the space to ourselves as well as was very friendly and letus know all we need to know about Kalamazoo as well as Michigan in general. His house had wonderful amenities and you could tell that it was very much stop put into the space. If you are in the area I would highly recommend booking with Joel! The amenities were strong and everything was clean to a standard that I would expect at my own place.

Stayed a few nights","The biggest thing that stood out to me was his kindness and responsiveness to messages. I feel like I asked a million dumb questions before my actual reservation day, and he was always kind and quick to answer. Also, I work night shift at the hospital and come from out of town. When working a long stretch of nights in a row, it's nice to have a local place to sleep because it can get exhausting driving an hour each way between shifts. He was extremely kind and accommodating, allowing me to check in early so I could have the whole day to sleep for work. Huge relief for me since I'm 6 months pregnant and permanently exhausted! I felt very safe there. I will absolutely be staying again!"

Stayed about a week","Joel is honestly a super nice guy, and a great host. He’s really welcoming and hospitable, and down to chat, but also completely understanding if you want to have your own space. The room was super nice and comfortable with a huge TV, air conditioning, and a lock and key on the door itself for the feeling of added safety. Checkin was easy and re-entry very straight forward with a number keypad. When he found out I was having trouble getting around, he loaned me his bike. Above and beyond, I had German every morning at 6 and it really stood out that he always had the timer on for hot coffee waiting for me. Another morning I had to be up by 8 ish and I figured he’d not do it since he knew I didn’t have German that morning, but low and behold, it was there. I was truly impressed with Joel’s generosity and kindness. His two cats are super sweet too. I think it should be noted it’s a house with pets so people super picky about litter may not be happy. If you’re chill, it’s a fantastic stay"

Stayed a few nights","If you're a budget conscious traveler looking for a homey place in downtown Kalamazoo, look no further! The photos are an accurate representation of what you'll see when you arrive, with a comfy bed, lots of closet and dresser space, a large screen TV with a variety of streaming services, and a nice work station close to a window.
In addition to having driveway parking, it's possible to walk to a number of Kalamazoo sites, including the Kalamazoo Institute of Arts, Bronson Park, the downtown branch of the Kalamazoo Public Library, and the Kalamazoo Civic.
Check-in and check-out is easy due to a programmable lock. If you have a question, Joel is readily available by AIrbnb Messenger, and you might run into him as you come and go - super friendly guy.
Do be aware that Joel has two very adorable cats that have the run of the house, so be mindful when entering and leaving, since they might want to take an unauthorized walkabout.
I say it every time I stay: I will be back!"

Stayed a few nights","Joel's house is located in a great area. City center of Kalamazoo is just a short walk and also the area itself - the Vine - is really nice. A lot of good Restaurants, Pubs and Bars are just short walks away. Joel was really nice too. He worked a lot during our weekend, so that we could have had our privacy, if we would have needed it. But he was also open to give some tips. All in all a very nice host, a nice old house in a great location. Reminded me of the beginning times of Airbnb, where you just had private hosts.
Thanks Joel for your hospitality and as we said: We love Kalamazoo and will be back for sure."

Stayed a few nights","Exactly what it purports to be: a comfy, homey place within blocks of a downtown park, the Kalamazoo Institute of Arts, the downtown branch of the Kalamazoo Public Library, and countless other spots in the heart of city. For those in need of a spot close to either Kalamazoo College or Western Michigan University, this is an excellent choice, with dedicated driveway parking, a comfortable bed, a GIANT flat screen television, lots of closet and dresser space, and a solid Wi-Fi connection. Please be aware that this is a home that's likely 100+ years old, so the hardwood creaks, the bedrooms are upstairs, and the bathroom, while clean and relatively roomy for a home of this age, has hard water, which is a given in this part of West Michigan. Joel was friendly, helpful, and incredibly responsive, which I very much appreciated. As someone who does a few days each month in Kalamazoo at a non-profit within a stone's throw of this property, I will do my best to book here as often as possible!"

He even messaged me to see when we would be in so he could leave the porch light on for us. Upon arrival we were greeted by Derp and briefly saw Stella. (A bonus for cat lovers.) Bedroom was pretty spacious and the bed itself was comfy. Our room had its own key and lock. Bathroom was clean. Location is great as it's walkable to great restaurants and downtown. Overall would definitely stay here again when visiting!

Always clean, tidy and with a responsive host.
The ZooPlex is an easy drive to anything in the Kalamazoo area, or a hop skip and a jump onto the highway to Grand Rapids or the West coast. Thanks as always Robb and hope to see you soon!"

I wish all AirBnB's were as great as this one. We will definitely try to stay here again when we are back in the area. Great backyard for the fur baby in your life.

There are other nearby hotels but I would say this is a FAR BETTER option at a competitive price. It is very close to the university which was where I was going as well as within walking (or short car drive) of restaurants, etc. If you are even considering Kristen's place don't delay - just book it. You won't be disappointed."

It's a bit noisy in the living room because it's right downtown. That's one of the charms though and on top of that the rooms you sleep in isolate the noise incredibly well and this is coming from someone who hates noisy places. Internet was fast and reliable for work. I would definitely stay here again.

In addition, Kristen left goodies for us and had all the amenities we could want (coffee!). I liked that there was a door with a code to get onto the floor, and free parking.
My favorite part, though, was the master bathroom. So often in airbnbs there is no place to put all your toiletries. This place had a cabinet sink so everything could go in the top drawer for very easy access.
It was so spacious! I absolutely loved it.
The one downside was it can be pretty noisy with the train/bus station across the street and all of the people there."

The décor and the amenities (e.g., bathroom supplies, trader joes everything, Alexa device, kitchen gadgets, range of breakfast items, coffee, tea, half&half, and super plush towels) really made this place stand out from other airbnbs. The kitchen, living room, and dining area were especially spacious and offered a lot of seating. Even though my wife and I were traveling with my parents, we all had enough room to spread out and do our own thing. We even got to play some of the provided board games while we were there. The place is situated right downtown which was convenient (it also obviously sounds like a city, but this didn't disturb our sleep at all). And the included parking garage spot felt safe and was right next to the apartment door which made it easy to unload our bags."

Parking is in the parking garage free of charge and the parking spot is about 30 feet from the door to the apartment so it’s very convenient. Only caveat is when you first enter the parking garage, you will need to grab a parking ticket, park, unload quickly within 10 minutes, and proceed to go back to your car with the parking pass you will find within the apartment.
Apartment has been updated but has kept a lot of the interior brick walls which lend to the historic nature of the home and the area, really cool!
Both bathrooms are large and the bedrooms are decently sized as well.
Kitchen and dining area are huge and an open floor plan.
Everything was very clean and we really loved the French press coffee maker
Host was great at communicating and flexible if we had any special requests

The house was very open which made it a nice spot to hang out before/after the activities.
We found that all the places we wanted to visit were within a ten-minute walking distance. As we walked, we could ""earn"" more drinks/food as we burned calories along the way and there zero worries about dealing with a car. This made the weekend even more enjoyable.

Great view of city life and felt safe with the the secure, private entrance. Kristen was an awesome Airbnb host. She was an excellent communicator, was accommodating with a few of our needs and special requests and truly made us feel welcome with her above and beyond hospitality.. checking in if we needed anything, dropping off a basket of special treats and bakery gifts and other pleasant touches.

The place is lovely, sparkling clean, tastefully decorated, and Kristen provides great amenities including a nice selection of foods so guests can make their own breakfasts. The internet went out when the Super Bowl game was on, and Kristen went way above and beyond to come to the apartment and hook us up with a different system so we could watch the game. Kristen’s communication is thorough and she responds very quickly. We would definitely recommend this spot to anyone interested in a unique, downtown type of stay. Sandra and Rod"

It’s also so convenient and walkable to lots of good restaurants, bars, coffee shops, etc. It was perfectly clean when we entered and check in and check out instructions were so easy and well done. Communication with Kristen couldn’t have been easier, and she was incredibly thoughtful throughout our stay. We missed our flight coming to town and when I let her know that we would be later than expected, she left us an assortment of groceries so that we wouldn’t have to worry about a late dinner that night or breakfast the next morning. She was one of the most thoughtful and thorough Airbnb hosts that I’ve ever worked with, and her place was one of my favorites that we’ve ever stayed at (and my family uses Airbnb a lot). Highly, highly recommend!!"

Stayed over a week","This apartment is large and very well appointed. It is clean and comfortable. All house systems worked well - heater, dishwasher etc. I was there in the winter so I have no knowledge of the cooling but the heat was great. The apartment has old-style charm, brick, original windows etc. All looked great and contributed to being comfy. Of note though - it is a bit noisy because of the original windows and the bus station across the street. It was not noisy enough to bother me. Also of note, the shower is located in an en-suite, which also did not bother me but if groups are traveling together just be aware that to use the shower you must go through a bathroom. Parking was awesome, inside a parking garage (included in the price). If you are traveling with a large vehicle or a trailer you may want to double check that you'll fit, but having this parking was really nice. The location is walkable to a bunch of stuff - which was less helpful during COVID but is nice to know that you can reach shops, restaurants, breweries with a short walk. The owner was easily reachable and responded quickly when needs arose. I would definitely return."

Great communication from Kristen. We would love to come back and stay here. Next time we come to Kalamazoo. On top of just having a great property and value, we arrived in a large RV and did not know where to park it. (Street and garage parking was not an option for the RV.) Kristen called a friend and found an empty driveway a couple of minutes away where we could leave it when we were not using it. She was amazing. Thank you so much."

She provides excellent communication throughout the process. Kristen provided us with breakfast food that was really good and more than lasted thru our stay. We've never had something like that before. If you are traveling to Kalamazoo, this is so much nicer than a hotel room. I highly recommend this loft.

The place also has central air, which was great because it was ridiculously hot outside during our stay, so you'll definitely be comfortable here! Kristen was also super responsive and super helpful in answering any questions I had, so don't hesitate to reach out to her if you have any questions. It's in the city, so it's a super convenient location if you want to explore Kalamazoo. It's across from a bus station, so it also seems commuter friendly if you don't have a car!"

Kristen had goodies for our breakfast that included Trader Joe's blueberry muffins, bacon, granola, raspberries, yogurt, and English muffins along with fresh eggs from her chickens. The French Press and South Bend range were special touches that made working in the kitchen and sitting at the kitchen island that much more special.
The Trader Joe products in the bathrooms along with all the oils and seasonings in the kitchen were noted and appreciated.
The furniture and beds were comfortable. The loft was a great location for going back and forth to campus for graduation ceremonies as well as the nearby downtown locations.

It is gorgeous, convenient, fun, sparkling clean and super comfortable. This would be a $400 a night STR in any other market. The loft is filled with excellent design touches, but uncluttered and unpretentious. Just sheer style. The spacious bathrooms! The well equipped kitchen! The great family area for playing games, hanging out and watching TV! The super comfy beds! The high end towels and sheets! And most of all—the jacuzzi whirlpool! Kristen and her partner bring you breakfast items from my favorite place, Trader Joe’s. Lots of fun soaps and skin care product for TJ, too. The parking is convenient and safe. I really can’t rave enough about this fun, stylish, awesome spot. If my son gets into K College, I will be back!!"

We were pleasantly surprised that it is even more spacious than what we expected from looking at the photos. In particular, we loved the sizable kitchen! We had some rather elaborate cooking and baking plans, and the kitchen allowed 4-5 people to work together at the same time without getting in each other’s way. The living space was perfect for us, with a large couch that served as a comfortable hangout spot for games, watching TV, etc. We also appreciated that the bathrooms were stocked with plenty of towels for the whole group.
Kristen is extremely communicative, helpful, and accommodating. The Airbnb truly felt like home for the weekend thanks to all the thoughtful touches she has sprinkled throughout the space. We highly recommend the place and would absolutely stay again given the opportunity."

The place is stunning architecturally and so very comfortable, and Kristen's personal touches, fresh flowers, coffee, snacks and local brews were so generous. The location of the loft in respect to several breweries and wonderful restaurants was within walking distance. We will be back to this lovely space with a lovely host."

She answered every question very quickly and even bought us some groceries! I can’t thank her enough for allowing us to stay at her place for my annual guys golf weekend. It was walking distance to breweries and restaurants. I would give her and her place six stars if I could. Thanks again Kristen!!!

She also had the house equipped with lots of extra food and snacks, Clorox wipes, hand sanitizer and more. Would definitely recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","Kristen’s loft was everything and more than we could have hoped for during our last minute quick trip to Kalamazoo. We never anticipated traveling during the pandemic, but we’re relocating from the east coast to Michigan, and had inspections at our new home that had to take place. Kristen not only was able to accommodate us at the last minute, she was a wonderful conscientious host, easy to reach and communicate with, for any questions or concerns that one might have during their stay.
We arrived with masks and gloves on after a 12 hr drive, and brought a huge tub of cleaning supplies, disinfectants, hand sanitizers, paper towels, antibacterial soaps and cleaners with us. However, not only was her beautiful loft spotless and sparkling clean, she had extra brand new clean towels, home made hand sanitizer, coffee, Prosecco, and extra cleaning supplies if we had needed them. The loft was fully stocked with everything to make our stay perfect.
Her loft is stunning, beautifully decorated and designed, so unique and spacious with high ceilings and beautiful artwork throughout. It looks like something out of Elle decor or Dwell magazine, yet warm and cozy, a great place to hang out, have a nice meal and just chill out.
There were two large desks that came in handy as my daughter had schoolwork, and my husband had zoom conference calls.
The beds were super comfortable and each room had wonderful unique touches throughout.
We loved our stay and would highly recommend Kristen’s loft for anyone visiting Kalamazoo that wants a truly unique experience.

If you do need to drive tho, the included parking space in the attached parking garage made it quick and easy to get in and out for free! My wife and I met another couple there and the living space was so large everyone felt comfortable the whole time. We really enjoyed the large dinning table and couch for hanging out and talking before going to bed. Two separate bedrooms and two bathrooms made it easy for each couple to have their own space and get showered in the morning. Kristen made sure the place was perfectly clean before we checked in and explained the check in process thoroughly. I can't imagine staying anywhere else next time we come to town."

This loft is an ideal downtown location with easy walking distance to bars, and it has a perfect set up for large groups. Parking was easy and there were plenty of towels for our group. It’s decorated very nicely with comfortable beds and a nice gathering space in the open kitchen/living room layout. Also great that there were two full bathrooms - two showers were critical for this sized group. The place is very clean and Kristen was responsive and easy to work with. We are already talking about staying here again in 5 years for our 20 year reunion!"

Stayed a few nights","Jackie and Zach have a beautiful place! it really feels like an apartment you can see yourself living in! The place is right next door to an amazing pizza shop and next to that is an amazing bakery!
We had 1 major hiccup that came down to noisy guests, but Jackie and Zach responded quickly to us (even at 12am) and ensured us that it was an anomaly. On top of that, they are communicating with us about the necessary steps they are taking with Airbnb to give proper consequences to the other guests. Plus, they are changing the way they write their contracts in order for this to never happen again.
Apart from that, the only other ""complaint"" we had was that the stairs are loud when you walk on them and the walls are a little thin (its an older building), however it did not take away from the great experience we had!
Jackie and Zach's place is within walking distance to everything major Kalamazoo offers! If we are in the area again, we will definitely be staying here again!"

So nice to have a parking space off the road and both a front and back entrance. We had bikes with us and so it was nice to take the elevator up with those so we didn't have to leave it in the car.
Jackie and Zach were very responsive and helpful. They even sent videos of the check in process so that it would go smoothly.
There is some train noise as you are in downtown and lots of trains go through. You can hear the people above you walking around, but that's also to be expected in any apartment or hotel setting. Hosts checked in and asked if we had questions, or needed help, or had suggestions. I suggested room darkening curtains and they were quick to respond to that and thank me for the feedback.
Great location! We loved walking to different bars and restaurants"

There were plenty of store's and restaurants/cafes nearby that were within walking distance which made the location perfect for us. We absolutely enjoyed our stay and if we come back to Kalamazoo this will be the first place we will look to stay.

Unit #3 has an unusual layout. The front door opens into the bedroom; you use the backdoor as your main door. There are three rooms -- bedroom, bath, and kitchen. There is no ""living room"" space; although, there is a very pleasant inclosed porch. My impression is that the other units have more traditional layouts. #3 might be exactly what you need. If you are looking for a more traditional layout, try the other units in their same house. I'm sure that Eric and Alison will be super accommodating."

The host had lots of local recommendations of things to do. The complimentary snacks were thoughtful. All of the extra hygiene items in the bathroom was a nice touch, since I forgot my shampoo at home! Our hosts were very friendly and helpful. The response time with communication was immediate. The only suggestion I have, is to maybe add a box fan in your closet, for us middle aged women that run hot (lol), and those who like to sleep with white noise. The lack of fan does not impede my rating, and I would stay at this place again in a heartbeat! Thanks again! 😊"

Stayed about a week","Gay (Gayl) is/was extremely attentive and thoughtful. She made us feel right at home by meeting us on arrival and carefully describing the suite. After a powerful tornado hit the nearby area (but thankfully not her home) she offered to help us with whatever was needed to make our stay secure. In brief - IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN GAY'S AirB&B.

I thought at first that this Texas Township/Portage location was a bit far away from all of our Kalamazoo connections, but the commute wasn't bad at all. And it was nice to spend some quiet time there between meetings with friends.
Great value! A peaceful get-away."

Stayed over a week","If you are looking to stay in the Kalamazoo area, then I could not recommend a better place than Gay’s! I had the opportunity to stay here for 3 weeks while on a veterinary externship and couldn’t be happier with my decision. First off, Gay’s house is in a beautiful, quiet, and safe neighborhood. Your stay starts off by meeting Gay and Nola who is the sweetest dog (and trust me, I have met quite a few dogs in my profession). The space itself has everything you would ever need for a short-term or long-term stay. Gay stocks it with dishes, towels, extra toiletries, pillows, blankets, etc. so she has got you covered in case you forget something at home! The space and backyard is BEAUTIFULLY decorated with Gay’s own artwork. She is extremely respectful of your privacy, but I also encourage you to get to know her because she is an incredible human being, and the world is a better place because she is in it. Gay is extremely responsive, communicative, and TRULY is an Airbnb superhost."

Stayed over a week","I heartily recommend this AirBnB for its value and for the owner's excellent hands-on approach to managing her property. This property is everything I expect. It offers spacious accommodations and amenities that hotels cannot beat.
We particularly appreciated the kitchenette facilities and ready access to the washer and dryer. The owner went out of her way to stock her pantry to suit our particular needs for breakfasts.
We could hear the owner and her dog on the floor above us. However, we fully expect this in this kind of accommodation. We are former dog owners ourselves, so we actually welcomed the homey sounds. We did not find the noise invasive or troublesome.
This location is perhaps farther from town than others, but it was still convenient to stores and restaurants. The price is commensurate with the distance. It's perhaps just a few more miles into town on freeways. We picked it because it was ridiculously close to our local family!
In summary, we really enjoyed our stay and will be back!"

Stayed a few nights","The positives:
We enjoyed staying with Gay and her puppy. Gay was an exceptional host. Very hospitable and quick to respond regarding check in. She had a bottle of wine and snacks available. Towels were clean and plentiful. Entrance was easy and safe and it was a lovely safe suburban neighborhood.
The negatives:
It probably should not be listed as having the “entire place” because you definitely know your staying in someone’s basement because there are loud plumbing noises and foot sounds (creaking) and puppy barks upstairs from 8am-10pm. However, it is very quiet at night so if you just plan to sleep there and you’re an early riser this shouldn’t be an issue.
Do not count on the futon for additional adult sleeping even for one night as it is very uncomfortable (but probably fine for a child).
She had a lock on her side of the basement door to go upstairs but we had no lock on our side.
I probably would stay at a hotel next time because for the same price you don’t have to strip your sheets, take the trash out and wash your dishes before leaving plus you get a full spread complimentary breakfast each morning."

The location is great, with many wonderful restaurants close by. Gay was certain to make our stay great, with helpful suggestions for food and entertainment. The neighborhood is beautiful, very safe and peaceful! One of the best things about this location is her adorable pup, Nola! She was there to greet us when we would come back from our adventures of the day. She provided peace and unconditional love! We spent the week in the area, as we were visiting our daughter, who is in Michigan for her graduate school field work. We expected to have a great time, because we would see our daughter. We ended up with so much more, thanks to Gay and Nola!!"

Gay’s place is great. Great price. Great location. Great size. Great vibe. Great furnishing. Great continental breakfast. Great Gay... and her sister that we enjoyed as a bonus hostess.
Perfect spot to stay if you are visiting WMU, the Air Zoo, or other greater Kalamazoo destination.

I love meeting other super-hostess community members as it gathers the bigger thread of why I continue to choose Airbnb stays over any other lodging choice Worldwide.
I’ve had a whirl wind of Airbnb these last two months as I was in South America experiencing half a dozen Airbnb spots, each special but not the treat that my stay with gay offered.Fantastic art abounds.

Replete with genuine art and thoughtful considerations, we feel like guests in her home rather than wayfarers.

Check in was extremely easy and Gayl communicated with me far enough in advance that I was confident in getting to her house and getting into the space without any hassle. It was also nice to be in such a quiet, safe feeling neighborhood. She even checked in with me to see if anyone in my group had any food allergies/preferences, so she could properly stock up the fridge with snacks and breakfast items. There was so much of her beautiful, personal artwork, as well as many interesting pieces from around the world. It made the space that much more fun and interesting. We had everything we needed to feel at home and even cook up a late night snack. The only thing we missed out on is meeting her and her puppy! I would highly recommend Gayl’s place to anyone staying in Kalamazoo for any length of time.

We were there for an event at the university and appreciated how close it was to the campus. The light that comes through the blinds from the street at night was pretty bright for me, though, so I recommend a sleep mask if you are sensitive to light."

Stayed a few nights","This was my 2nd time staying at Douglas's place, and it was great to return. Everything is clearly labeled and there are many extra's that often aren't provided by air bnb's. The beds and other furniture are all very comfortable, and the dishes, pans, and other kitchen appliances all are good quality. Overall, it is a very comfortable for 2-3 people to stay. The description on the website is very accurate. Although I have never met the hosts, Douglas has always responded quickly to any questions that I have had. I highly recommend this place! I think it is a real value for the price. Just realize that there is only one bathroom and it is between the two bedrooms. That could be an issue for some people, but was not a problem for us. I will definitely book again if I need a place to stay in Kalamazoo."

However, depending on if you were using the back room as a bedroom, it could be awkward to walk through a bedroom to get to the bathroom. My kids loved playing in the backyard. It was very convenient to get to Kalamazoo College from the house and it worked great for us to walk just a block to a coffee shop for breakfast in the morning."

Didn't take long to find excellent coffee at Water Street coffee downtown, and beer/lunch at Bell's Eccentric Cafe.
The bathroom is accessible by both bedrooms but there are locks inside for privacy. You just have to remember to unlock the other bedroom's bathroom door before you leave. Kinda tight quarters entering the bathroom from the front bedroom.
As most everyone has commented, there's a lot of signage, everywhere, and it's very useful! Takes the guesswork out of getting to know the house.
The neighborhood is very quiet and the neighbors are nice."

Stayed a few nights","Hassle free stay, I had zero questions all weekend, more time to relax and have fun. Everything from getting the code to the front door before you get there, having everything you need organized and clearly labeled, the motion activated lights down the driveway for night time, the clean fresh smell as soon as you walk in, warm cozy central air, nice furniture plenty of places to get comfortable and have fun with friends, extra blankets and pillows, power strips on all tables in convenient spots you dont even have to look for plugs, there's even ice in the freezer and a crockpot in the kitchen. The one ""bad"" thing I can think of about this place is just one bathroom and shower, but it was easy to work around it with four people staying two nights. The kitchen and bathroom have been updated, nice furniture set up for comfort and convenience. They took extra steps to give you everything you might need and the labels all over give you all info needed."

Stayed a few nights","The house has everything you need and more! Doug thought of everything. From flashlights to free snacks and coffee, to labeling everything so you know how things work and where they are. We had almost 2 feet of snow when we were there, and he had the driveway plowed every day, provided salt, and shovels. The two living room areas were great when we needed privacy to get some work done. The backyard is so nice, even though we couldn't use it because of the snowstorm. The front porch is also very cozy. The location is excellent. I can't say enough nice things about this place. We've already booked it again for next year. If I had to pick one negative thing, it would be that they only have one bathroom. But with all of the other great amenities, you easily overlook having to share. Also, Doug was extremely responsive! You will not be disappointed with this one."

Everything within the home was clearly labeled (so things were easy to find), and the kitchen was stocked with all the amenities you would need (including complementary bottled water and snacks). Douglas was quick to respond whenever we communicated and the check-in process was a breeze. If you need a place to stay in the Kalamazoo area, I would highly recommend this AirBnB."

Doug set the bar for communication with concise check-in instructions and also with his professional way of organizing and labelling everything in the house.
His house was a cozy, welcoming place, equipped with everything we could think of. The crunchy chips gave a great delight to my son. A personalized chalkboard welcome note was a plus big time, a nice touch, showing Doug’s attention to minute details.
All in all, Dough is an excellent host, his house is a super nice, cozy place and we’d rent it in a heartbeat again!"

This trip was my first in an airbnb and it set the bar incredibly high as a ""home away from home"". There were so many lovely little touches, from the 'Welcome!' greeting left on the chalkboard to the well-stocked snacks. It was elegant and comfortable all at the same time. My son also loved running around in the (fenced in) back garden- perfect for children. I also highly recommend Five Lakes coffee at the end of the street. I absolutely cannot wait to stay again."

Stayed about a week","I so deeply appreciated my stay at this Air BNB at 208 Nelson. So many wonderful touches. Doug has labeled things throughout the house so I was immediately comfortable knowing what switch worked and what it was associated with. Water pressure great. House was very clean. Kitchen well stocked and with snacks, coffee and tea available. Water bottles in the fridge were another lovely touch.
The house has two bedrooms and futons in the living room and the bonus room in back. There are blankets available just to throw on your lap for a chilly night. The thermostat worked well when temperatures dropped.
The backyard is fenced. There is a deadbolt on the front door and a security bar on the back. As a single traveler I appreciated that. But it is a family neighborhood so never felt unsafe. It was also very quiet.
The TV has several cable channels with lots of choices. There were additional plugs added throughout the house including ones for USBs, which this traveler used and appreciated. The wifi was strong and easy to access.
Locally, you are pretty close to downtown Kalamazoo on one side and on the other is shopping (Target, Ross, Trader Joe’s, Cost Co) so plenty of options. Many restaurants close by, but I stayed in and cooked (just my preference) and I was there to visit family and was cooking for them too. So, for my needs the kitchen worked very well!
I also want to put in a word for the host, Doug. He just went above and beyond to answer questions, stopped by to make sure all was working and because I was staying for a bit, helped show me some of the other house features. Thank you, Doug."

On our way to this AIRBNB there had been a storm and a HUGE tree had fallen on electric lines. Many of the homes were dark due to no electricity. We wondered if we would have electric but were happy to see that we did. Doug had flashlights available throughout the house so this was not a concern. What another SPECIAL safety touch.
We had fun working a puzzle. Special treats - chips and cookies were enjoyed. It was fun to read all the labels throughout and which made it easy to figure out how to move about and where to find things.
We told our cousin who we were visiting that we now have two reasons to come back to Kalamazoo. - one to visit them and two to stay in this special nest. I agree THEIR NEST IS BEST."

Stayed a few nights",We absolutely loved our stay at Chad & Stephanie’s. We were in town for a concert at Wings Event Center. This loft made for the perfect 2 night stay. We were able to walk the trails of the Al Sabo Land Preserve that is just behind this property. The preserve has lots of well marked trails to enjoy. The loft has everything you need & is a super cozy space. We enjoyed a quiet afternoon sitting on the back patio & a relaxing evening inside playing games. We had the opportunity to meet the hosts & their children & they were all delightful. So great to see a family spending quality time outside yet respecting the people staying on the property. Stephanie went above & beyond when she delivered coffee grounds to us. We are in our early fifties & had no trouble climbing the ladder to the sleeping quarters. I hope nothing but the best for this sweet family as they continue to make this loft a great little spot for their guests. Definitely want to return at some point. Highly recommended!!

Everything I needed was right there. It was peaceful and quiet with a view of the woods where wildlife liked to spend time. Birds could be seen at the edge of the woods almost every day. One day, two deer show up right below a walnut tree. I watched them for about 5 minutes. Then, suddenly, out jumps a baby too. It was a wonderful experience all around."

Stephanie and Chad, the hosts, were incredibly friendly and responsive. They even went out of their way to bring us something that was missing. Initially, we were surprised to discover that the tiny home was located in their backyard and that their family would be around. However, their kindness and warm welcome made us feel comfortable, and we never felt our privacy was being invaded.
While only a minute away from I-94, staying here felt like a trip to a quiet forest. We'd definitely recommend a stay here!"

The location was easy to find, check in and the stay was great. I made use of the full kitchen and hosted several people one at a time for breakfast and dinner. It was a great change of pace from having to eat out every meal if staying in a hotel.

Stayed a few nights","We really enjoyed our time here. For being a tiny house, it was very spacious for just the two of us. You could tell it was an old structure, but it was very clean and decorated well. There are lots of windows and a pretty view of the yard and surrounding woods. I really liked that most of the windows faced away from the other two properties, so we shut the blinds on one window and got to enjoy the views from the others while maintaining privacy. The kitchen was well stocked with dishes and cooking supplies, the bathroom had fluffy towels, and the bed was comfy with soft sheets. There was a raised fire pit with comfy patio furniture and we enjoyed a fire one night there. We brought our own wood, but noticed that they were kind enough to have a supply too! When we spent time outside we were visited by their very friendly cats. I had issues with the wifi while trying to work remotely, but it would suit your needs for just recreation. The great property and convenient location will have us returning in the future!"

Stayed a few nights","I was disappointed to discover that the loft bed was just an air mattress. However, this made sense when I got there and saw how restrictive it was to get up to that space. Kids would love it, but if you are an adult with any type of disability (which I am) the only other option is an uncomfortable couch bed. Or the floor, which is where I ended up sleeping.
Everything else about this space was fine. However, these two things could be much improved upon."

Stayed a few nights",This is a charming tiny house! It's as pictured and seems larger than it looks. The large windows bring in a lot of natural light. The beauty of the outdoors may be seen from each window. It is a great place for a personal retreat. The snow falling softly during my say added a magical quality to my stay. I think this rental would be great in any season. I hope to return someday. Stephanie provided great communication. I would recommend a stay here.

The location is perfect for a quick ski trip to bittersweet or a hike at the Kalamazoo Nature Center. Our host were extremely responsive to all our needs.

Stayed a few nights","A lovely little house located in a beautiful setting. Very private and fully stocked for comfort, a good value. We enjoyed our 2 night stay. The main bed is in a loft a bit of a tough climb for older folks (like us) or for those with other physical issues. A couple of other points to be aware of; the WiFi was very spotty, almost unusable, and I've let Stephanie know so we're sure she will fix it. Also, the house is a bit musty smelling, not surprising as it's an older structure located in a damp climate. Other than that it met our needs nicely."

The location is ideal as it is just off 94 (without the traffic noise!) and close to Texas Corners which has some wonderful restaurants, as well as the Al Sabo Land Preserve which we enjoyed hiking through. We were greeted by their barn kitties upon arrival which was very sweet. The house has a ton of charm and everything you need in a well-organized layout. While we mostly enjoyed sunny, hot weather while we were there, there was a brief rainstorm which was wonderful to watch through the large windows reading a good book - perfection! Stephanie was a great host and very responsive. Can't wait to come back some day!"

We loved sleeping in the loft, and hanging out on the main floor playing games and watching t.v.. We cooked all of our meals and we were extremely satisfied with the amenities in the kitchen. The property was stunning, the other houses on the property were close and I thought I would mind that for privacy but there were no issues and I felt right at home. The windows in the house are situated so you get a view of the property vs. a view of the house/barn which led to a more tucked away in nature feel. We fully recommend this place as a wonderful stay in Kalamazoo!!"
