So cute that there are spare toothbrushes and travel needs, and she went above and beyond with sweet local treats and a welcome gift! Highly recommend."

It was a great alternative to staying in a hotel and felt like we were in our own home. Host accommodated us needing a pack and play for our baby. My only wish is that there was a rocking chair to help our baby fall asleep like we would normally do at home. I would stay here again either way!

The host even came over and shoveled for us after the first blizzard of the season came through! They were incredibly helpful and kind, if we decide to do a reunion weekend again I hope this space will stick around."

The kitchen had wonderful appliances and was well stocked with quality cook and dish ware. As a bonus, they had child-friendly plastic dish ware for the kiddos and high chairs. The instructions were clear and welcoming.
The bedrooms were excellent- comfy beds, perfect blankets, good pillows, sound machine in every room! They had multiple lounge and dining spaces which made it so great for spending time with family— a place for the adults to chat and the kids to play.
The bathrooms were great— three full ones with really good and plenty of towels, extra toiletries, all the supplies, so thoughtful!
The yard was so good— fenced with a table and chairs and a nice bbq. Truly one of the best places I’ve ever stayed. An absolute gem and we will be back!"

It was a great place for our family to have downtime, relax and play games at the great table spots. We appreciated the two table areas on the main level- for games and sharing a meal. The kids had their own space; and adults could easily mingle around dining table and kitchen breakfast bar area. We brought hot cocoa pods and the kids loved making their own hot drinks at the coffee bar. We loved the charm of mid 50’s home design and some of the modern furnishings and comfort of the living room couches."

Group trip","We absolutely loved staying at this place. Some of group had never rented a house before (only hotels) and thought it wouldn’t be as good. Turns out they now understand that it’s even better!
Appreciate all the little details like the sound machines in the bedrooms, high quality toilet paper and paper towels, thick fluffy towels and comfy linens, fully equipped kitchen with really good clear instructions for how everything worked.
Felt like we were staying with friends, very welcoming and thoroughly enjoyable from the first second we walked in. We were sad to leave…"

Stayed a few nights","This was the second time I stayed here because it is more spacious and about same price as some hotels. On the plus side there is that, and comfortable bed, good wifi, convenient location to UND, good amenities, good heat/air and overall nice Once again however, the building tenants kept me up through early am hours. It seems the people in this building don’t care about making noise and tslking loudly on the phone all night long. I see no rules posted about quiet hours. The place was not fully cleaned when we arrived nearly three hours after 3:00 check in. Arrived to laundry basket with trash in it propping open door, dining chairs on the bed (yuck) awaiting floor to dry and the dining table had sticky stains on it and dirty water in sink. When i called Cole and left a message no call back. But housekeeper did come back a while after that. The place looked clean but the shower had many hairs on the walls and the was no “clean smell” and other signs of not very thorough cleaning."

Stayed one night","We arrived 30-45 minutes after the posted check-in time. The place was in an apartment building, but nowhere in our communication could I find a unit #. We had been given just 2 codes: one for building entry, which worked, so we weren't standing outside anyway. The other code was for the unnamed unit. I called and messaged, then called Airbnb to try to find out the unit. We saw a unit door with a keypad, tried the unit code, and it worked. We had just walked in when Cole responded. He seemed upset we were in the wrong unit and gave me another unit code and number. He said he doesn't give out the unit number until they were done cleaning, even though we were arriving AFTER the designated check-in time. I felt communication was poor, and he implied we were at fault, until he finally apologized. Just a frustration we didn't need.
The unit was fine...nothing special. We were instructed to take out our own garbage and were charged $40 cleaning for 1 night."

It is located in an old hotel so the walls are a bit thin. There was also a lot of truck traffic at night so for me being a light sleeper I was awake a lot.
There was also a plug in air scented device which was very strong and once we figured out where the scent was coming from we were able to unplug it and get some fresh air by opening the windows. This may not be a factor for many but I have sensitivity to perfumes and colognes."

Plenty of towels, kitchen well stocked, plenty of room in each room and great instruction upon check in. It's a 1930 Cottage and I appreciated how the owners preserved the uniqueness of the cottage. I have stay in numerous Airbnb and VRBO over the past years and wasn't disappointed at all. I plan to make staying at C on C an annual tradition when we come back to visit family. Highly recommended C on C.

Stayed a few nights","Enjoyed the stay at the house. We had a boat/trailer, so the driveway is a little on the narrow side and a little challenging backing into, but can be done if vehicles are not parked on the street. If I had one thing to single out, the fridge was a little on the small side and had no freezer. However, there is a large upright deep freeze in the basement that worked well. We will be back again next year."

Stayed with a pet","Our hosts were quick to respond to any queries...from a request for early check in, as well as any other issues that arose after check in, which we appreciated very much. The cottage is located within a couple of blocks of access to miles and miles of biking trails on the North Dakota and Minnesota side of the Red River. The property was easy to find and very close to a number of restaurants if that is what you need. We were familiar with Grand Forks, and prefer to do our own cooking so were pleased with the kitchen appliances, kitchen ware and cook ware. Any of issues were addressed quickly and we were very pleased with both Karli and Zach's assistance when these issues arose. The yard is fenced and the street very quiet, it would have been great if either the garden shed or garage was accessible to store our bikes safely, but we worked around that. We enjoyed our stay immensely, and was just what we needed for a recharge and celebrate our 38th Anniversary! thank you both"

The beds were comfortable and I very much appreciate the fans in each room. The back yard was adorable and a nice place to enjoy our morning coffee. Great place!

Stayed with kids","While this home was located in a quiet neighborhood that was not particularly chose to shopping and restaurants, it was adorable and well appointed, and it offered a cozy and safe feel. The home met our needs, and we were generally happy with our stay. We must note, however, that the instructions booklet we received when we arrived prohibited gatherings and visitors outside our family group. We were in town to meet with extended family, so this restriction felt oppressive. If you plan to meet with others outside your group, we would not recommend this home for you.
Additionally, the home had safety issues, especially regarding the upstairs bedroom. The steps were steep and slippery, making it unsafe for young children to climb alone. The doorknob to the bedroom was broken, and the door could not be opened from inside the bedroom, making it a significant safety hazard. The air flow to the upstairs bedroom was minimal, making the room overly warm to sleep in."

Walking to the local restaurants was convenient and easy, even though my husband and I are seniors.
We hope to be able to return in the nicer weather as the yard looked so inviting!

The only down side is that because it is a duplex you can hear everything as I’m sure Megan could hear my kids running around! Nothing that would stop me from returning though, in fact we look forward to coming back when it’s warmer! I would recommend Megan’s place 100%."

Stayed a few nights","Megan’s place was in a great location- lots great walking trails. The house was pristine! So very clean! Also the family was incredibly quiet, we didn’t even know there were young children in home. Highly, highly recommend. Only thing to take note of, is that bathroom amenities are not included. So bring your own shampoo etc. Not a big deal at all, we just neglected to notice before we went. But this is so incredibly minor. Still rated a 10/10 easily!"

The apartment was clean and well appointed. We happened to hit upon a nasty and snowy cold snap, and Megan was kind enough to let us park the car in the heated garage.
We'll definitely be back if ever in Grand Forks again! This place is great value."

Megan was wonderful and greeted us as they checked in and made sure to address any questions we had and also give us a run down of the place. They stayed for 3 nights and were so thankful to be able to have a clean, warm, comfy and welcoming home to stay in - much better than putting them in a hotel room. The airbnb was also closer to downtown than any hotels in town are, so that was great. If you're needing a comfy, affordable, clean, and easy stay - this would be a great place to book!"

It's a great location and super easy to find and I would totally recommend staying here if you're looking for something relatively cheap and plus they are super easy to work with. The only reason I could think of to not stay here is if you get annoyed by hearing noise from downstairs since they have a couple of kids and obviously they are going to be kids and not worry about making noise. But that said they were also pretty dang quiet considering that they are kids being kids and they were never noisy at night. Other than that I would 100% recommend staying here.

Stayed a few nights","Our first impression as we walked through the front door was a tidy entryway with some nicely done artistic touches to the entryway walls. Our space which was the loft of the house was surprisingly spacious with many nice touches that gave it a homey feel. The living room had plenty of seating with a very comfortable couch and futon. The kitchen was suitable for making basic meals which was really all that we needed. We enjoyed coffee and breakfast each morning and returned each evening to a very comfortable peaceful and quiet space to recharge from our days outings. The bedroom was also spacious with a large closet to store items and hang clothes. And the bed was wonderfully comfortable. The whole bedroom was simple but tastefully decorated.
Our host Brian was an amazing host who communicated with us frequently and promptly resolved a very minor issue that we had. I can see why he is rated as a super host!
I would definitely recommend this as a stay location while visiting Grand Forks and the surrounding areas!"

My son said the bed was very comfortable, and I used the futon, which I slept better in than I do in my bed at home. We were impressed with the cleanliness of the apartment, and Brian had extras out for us, such as breakfast bars and fresh fruit, soaps and shampoos, a blow dryer, and everything you need in a kitchen, if you are inclined to do some cooking. Overall, it was a very nice experience, and if I definitely recommend The Keeper's Inn, if you are going to be in the Grand Forks area.

Stayed a few nights",The house was super cozy and nicely furnished and Brian was super helpful especially when he heard that I might not be able to make it because of weather. The only slightly bad thing about it is there is a slight smell of cigarette smoke when you first get there but after being there for maybe 15 minutes I never noticed it the rest of the weekend. So if you just can't handle that smell then I wouldn't recommend this but other than that everything was wonderful and I can't think of a reason you wouldn't stay here.

Stayed a few nights","Brian is a fabulous host. He was very flexible with our arrival time, and was generally very accommodating. The place is fairly no frills, but was a comfortable and pleasant stay. It's small and cozy, but was absolutely perfect for what the two of us needed. The amenities are somewhat basic, but Brian has provided everything you need - there were extra pillows, towels, and blankets that were easy to find when we wanted a little extra comfort, and the kitchen has cookware and dishware aplenty. The location was perfect for us - a quiet residential area that wasn't far from local businesses (we even walked to JL Beers for dinner since the weather was surprisingly temperate!)"

Stayed a few nights","We had a very good stay at Brian's place. The place is as pictured, it is a small apartment on the upper floor of his home. The bed was comfortable, there was a dresser and good sized closet for your things. Fridge, microwave and coffee pot all worked great (we didn't use the stove). Bathroom is small but effective - shower had lots of hot water, a blow dryer was provided, etc. A/C worked great, we were comfortable with high temps of 80 degrees. The A/C is at the far said of the apartment from the bedroom but by putting the large box fan in the bedroom door with the A/C on we were more than comfortable. I especially appreciated Brian's very quick responses on all my questions and the opportunity to check out late when he didn't have someone else coming in the day we left. Providing fruit, bottled water and granola bars was a nice touch, too."

I was so stressed during this time as I was scheduled to go on vacation with my grandson at the same time. As I was searching for hotels, the topic of an Airbnb came up in conversation. Needless to say, I was elated to find Brian's place and grateful he was available! The accommodations fit our needs well: a separate bedroom, a futon in the living area, free WiFi, television, refrigerator (thank you for the water bottles), microwave, plates/cups and coffee pot! We basically slept at the BnB and prepared for the day as we spent most our time with family. Location was great for us and price very affordable! So thankful to have found this Airbnb (rather than a hotel), I would highly recommend staying at Brian's place."

Overall, we enjoyed our stay and will certainly keep Brian in mind the next time we visit Grand Forks."

Stayed a few nights","Brian's place was the perfect fit for me during my one week stay in Grand Forks. I needed a place to work and crash after the workday and I appreciated having convenient access (6 min. or less) to a grocery store, gas station, and the hospital. Having a kitchen equipped for light meal prep was super helpful, and I appreciated the complimentary fruit, coffee, and popcorn provided. Brian was very kind to offer helpful information about the area and checked in via AirBnB messaging to make sure everything was going well midweek. Just to help understand the set-up, the apartment is the upper floor of a duplex. I personally give two enthusiastic thumbs up on what at least feels like a tempur-pedic mattress! I was a little surprised that there is a faint scent of smoke in the apartment, but unless you are sensitive, this should not be an issue. Overall, I opted for Brian's place for the location and kitchen access, and I would do the same again! Thanks!"

Stayed over a week",Mrs.Lynne & Mr.Davis were both more than generous. They welcomed my family with open arms and a home full of love. They were very accommodating to my needs as a mother and as a wife working to provide for her family. Lynne and Davis hosted my family during an emotionally challenging time. They made sure we were comfortable and safe within there property. They welcomed us into their own home aswell for tea and breakfast. I hands down have never met two people so selfless and so kind. They have went above and beyond for my family during this difficult time. And they continue to do so. Lynne and Davis are very well known around the grand forks and manvel area for there properties on the Airbnb and get the much needed credit they deserve. They have owned there property longer than the years I have lived on this earth and the property hasn’t aged one bit. The property is on farm land so the area is private and secluded ! This home is worth it all! Treat it like you would your own❤️

Stayed with kids","Our travels had us coming to Grand Forks and Lynne’s bunkhouse was just a short drive (by Midwest standards) from there. It was very easy to find with the directions Lynne provided and was very quick to respond when I had questions before our arrival. Initially the listing said there was no heat or hot water but that was not the case. We left in the mornings and didn’t get back until late in the evenings so we basically just slept there and got ready in the mornings. It’s on a farm so expect privacy and quiet. If you’ve never stayed in a farmhouse you might be surprised by the creaks and other noises you hear but that’s nothing new to us. The price was several hundred dollars less than a hotel in Grand Forks, which was awesome. It’s a great option that we are going to remember the next time we’re in the area. Thanks Lynne!"

Quiet, peaceful, and homey. Everything i like in my lodging.
Our hosts were friendly and helpful and a joy to chat with. Always willing to help.

It’s located on a farmstead a couple miles outside of the nearest town—I slept in the upper level with the window open and woke up each morning to the sound of birds chirping and roosters crowing. I wish every day started that way! The hosts were friendly and helpful and then communication was outstanding. If you’re looking to stay somewhere a little off the beaten path while you’re in the area, this is a great choice."

Stayed a few nights","I was happy I came across Laviona’s Airbnb! Grand Forks wanted to charge an arm and a leg to stay in a hotel for two days and I got the same experience if not better staying at Laviona’s for a way better price tag. I appreciated that I was welcomed to snacks and toiletries during my stay. This was my second time doing a shared airbnb and I felt very safe and the place was pretty clean. My room was equipped with a mini fridge, microwave, keurig, and TV. This was great because I did not need to leave my room unless I needed to use the restroom which was just down the hall. The lock on my door however did not lock when I left out of the room. Overall, my stay was very peaceful and the location of the Airbnb was extremely close to where I needed to be during the weekend. If I ever need somewhere to stay in grand forks, Laviona’s place is top on my list!"

I also experienced an extremely hot room as the temperature was 90 degrees. I messaged Laviona about the issue and she was able to fix it the next morning. I ended up sleeping that night with the bedroom window open as far as it would go to try and get some cool air into the room. Sadly, I did get sick due to the hot temperature. But after that issue was taken care of I did have fairly quiet and peaceful stay."

However, if you happen to check in early even by 30 minutes early, you will get charged a fee which I hoped the host would understand and not charge considering the special situation I was in, but she did it anyways. So, in that case specifically, the host was not that helpful, but for everything else, she was cordial and polite."

Stayed a few nights","For the price, this place was great. We had a few things that could have been better, but it definitely gave us what we needed. I will say, add your max possible group size when you book. We had to pay a little extra when we asked if our friends could stay as well. Our largest group was 3 adults and 3 kiddos which was within the max group of 10 for sure. The AC wasn't working but someone did come to repair it when we were there. Very quick communication with the owner. The neighborhood has some kiddos that came to the backyard and ran around with our kids. They all had a great time playing and making memories. That was what the days were for. We were able to spend some quality time with our friends in this house with the perfect amount of space."

Group trip","Had family coming in from all over the country for a funeral, and this was the perfect place to stay for us. Small town, nice neighbors, and all the amenities we could’ve wanted for our situation. The house is lived in, so it feels loved and not just an empty rental house, so be prepared to see (some) clothes in drawers and personal affects, but that just lets you know the place is taken care of. Some areas are under repair as Paul is looking to upgrade, but nothing hampered our experience. Paul was extremely friendly and easily available when needed. I’d return in a heartbeat if needed."

Stayed one night","Danielle is a phenomenal host - and as you can see from my profile a main highlight is I don’t like chit chat but Danielle was so friendly and we had a good chat about local things to do, the area, travel plans, etc. HER FLEXIBILITY IS UNMATCHED. My company rented me a fully furnished home for thousands more but I had to vacate by noon. I was exhausted from being up all night and no hotel or airbnb was available for check in for hours and there was no way I could make the drive to the Four Seasons in Minneapolis. DANIELLE TO THE RESCUE! She let me check in at noon. greeted me, let me use her driveway instead of parking on the street (which was a huge help since my SUV costs around $100k). The bedroom is small as describes but not ridiculously tiny and bed is SO COMFORTABLE! i wish I’d rented out her room for the entire time I was in Grand Forks instead of having my company waste money on more space than could ever be needed. BOOK A STAY WITH DANIELLE!! 10/10 stars. She is fantastic."

Stayed one night","This is a small 2 bedroom home with one very small bathroom. You will share bathroom and main spaces with the owner, Danielle, who is quite pleasant. I was not expecting to share my small room with her cat, but kitty was jumping all around the room all night and was anything but shy around me. I tried to shut the door to keep kitty out and it knew how to jump into the door and get it open which startled me quite a bit, so I left the door open for it to come and go even though I’m allergic. Kitty woke me up several times jumping on me in bed. If I had known I would have to share the space with a cat, I would not have chosen to stay here. Otherwise this is an inexpensive place to stay for a night."

Stayed a few nights","We had a great stay! Clean place just as described. I gave my pregnant friend the bed and I took the pull out, standard pull out bed but I slept well nonetheless. There were enough pillows, blankets and kitchen dinnerware etc.
Close to a nice walking path by the river and the building had a basic fitness centre for a good workout.
The hosts were very quick to respond to the few questions I had.
I would stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights",Beautiful spacious stay. The place was nice and clean and the bed was very comfortable. Extra linens provided for the pull out was also appreciated. The kitchen was fully stocked with dishes and pots/pans which was great. Walking distance to downtown was perfect. The host was always quick to respond with any questions we had. Getting into the building had very clear instructions and we had no issues with that - it also made us feel safe and secure. Overall amazing stay!

The place was completely spotless, minimalistic which I love but had all the basics that we needed. There are also tons of things to see and do in Grand Forks! I would go again and stay here again! :)"

It should be stated that it is an upstairs condo , not everyone could haul their luggage up the stairs. Also the streaming options on the tv were difficult to maneuver, often asking for a Prime code so often settled on watching something not preferred."

Stayed a few nights","There is a reason Chris is a Superhost and...I never saw him in person. Chris responded within 5 minutes after I initally messaged him. We were coming to see my friend who had just accepted Hospice.
My traveling partner was to arrive one day before me-he communicated well with her too. Then, we got word my friend had passed..we decided to come to N Dakota anyway. THEN Blizzard Olive cancelled every flight we were on to get there. Life circumstances comes to all of us. Chris was the most understanding and we hadnt even met- only messages thru Airbnb. Please do not hesitate a minute longer-stay at Chris'"

Stayed one night","Chris was a fantastic host who was SUPER responsive, attentive to detail & overall a pleasure to book with. He accommodated our 1 night stay as requested BUT also accommodated another night when we had to stay longer due to car troubles & not being able to travel back home to Winnipeg, MB.
The Air BnB itself was super cute, well maintained, spacious & a perfect little place to stay while visiting Grand Forks. We really appreciated the coffee, the toiletries (as much as one can make sure you pack everything, I definitely forgot a few things), the reclining couches, the extra bathroom, extra towels/linens & the cute little deck/patio.
Very well lit with lamps, lots of natural sunlight, updated throughout & cozy!
I would recommend staying here to anyone, everyone! We were SUPER happy with our stay 🥰"
