Stayed one night","This was a perfect getaway! We were 3 college best friends — one living in West Virginia, one living in Baltimore, and one living in DC. This was perfectly in the middle and in gorgeous mountain area. The kitchen was well stocked. The house was super clean. The beds were comfy! We also took a little walk down to the stream to get a little exercise and fresh air. Highly recommend if you’re looking to get away for a relaxing peaceful vacation!"

Stayed with kids","Tom's place was the way it was described and more. The kitchen was clean and made it easy to cook our delicious meals. It was well stocked with everything we needed to make ourselves at home. The beds were comfortable and clean. The kids enjoyed walking the trail that leads to the stream. We even spotted deer along the way!
My wife and enjoyed the fireplace, the patio space as well as the grill station.
The place was just what we needed for a great Get-Away that offered solitude and privacy. I would recommend this gem to anyone interested in a tranquil location.
Thank you Tom for your hospitality!"

Stayed with a pet","This was our second stay at Trent's place, and it was wonderful once again! It's great to have a place in Winchester where we can bring our dog, and they always have thoughtful touches to the space. The neighborhood next to the house is very walkable, and it's a short drive to lots of fun things (Old Town Winchester, Jim Barnett Park, Winchester Brew Works, Bonnie Blue Market). Be sure to check this one out if you're coming to Winchester!"

Stayed a few nights","What a beautiful stay- the space was cozy and clean- the grounds were fun,- we were greeted with smiles, invited to join in the fire pit relaxation; the chickens were fun to watch and gave the place a country feel while in the city- We enjoyed coffee on the deck overlooking the historic site, didn’t try the hammock but just ran out of time. The kitchen amenities are creative with the limited space but very functional. We appreciated the full washer and dryer over a large kitchen set up. The bed was supportive, netflix and WIFI were easy to access. Plenty of towels, bedding and extra pillows if needed. Honestly- the best we could have asked for. The location made it so easy to get to food, gas or the highway. It was perfect for our trip home to visit family- we will definitely book again!"

Stayed with a pet","We stayed at Trent's place over New Year's Eve weekend and really liked it. There was a beautiful decorated Christmas tree in the main room, it was warm, and there were lots of little touches that made it feel cozy and welcoming. We were also so grateful to find a dog-friendly Airbnb, and our dog loved it there. It's a pretty short drive to most Winchester stuff, the neighborhood behind is very quiet, and we were able to just chill. Thank you to the hosts!"

Stayed a few nights","Staying in a piece of Virginia history was enchanting. The facility situated in a 1790 log cabin was cozy, comfortable and oozing with charm. Everything about the space exceeded expectations. The hosts were congenial and made our stay comfortable and relaxing. The proximity to the university campus was a major reason for the choice as I was teaching a masterclass. It was equally very close to the historic Winchester old town about 8 minutes away from a plethora of fine dining and boutique shopping. Truly a Virginia gem."

The owners are friendly and have decorated the property in a wonderfully eclectic style! The inside has everything you could possibly need for a short or extended stay and you're just a short drive from the Winchester historic district. I loved my time here!

Stayed a few nights","Trent's place was great! The suite is attached to the house where he lives, but with a private entrance off a shared porch. The host is nearby for any issues or questions, but the space is completely separate giving you privacy. We really enjoyed the peace and quiet, and the space was really cozy. There were chickens out back that we enjoyed watching strut around as we got ready in the mornings (they were not noisy). We saw Trent tending to the yard a few times, and he was always very friendly but gave us lots of space.
The bed was comfortable, the shower was warm, and the kitchenette was perfect. We took day trips to Luray Caverns and Harper's Ferry, and enjoyed the walking mall and museum (MSV) in Winchester. All were very easy to get to from the house.
This house is a real gem, and we would absolutely stay there again! We definitely recommend it!
Thanks Trent and Nameeta for giving us a comfortable, clean, and quiet place to stay, and for being wonderful hosts!"

The bed was very comfortable and there were plenty of extra pillows and blankets. A hammock and two chairs on the private upper deck provided a relaxing spot to read and drink wine in the evening or watch the chickens frolic in the yard during the day. The host was very responsive, but also gave total privacy leaving anything requested outside the door within minutes. It is located very close - about a 5 minute drive - from restaurants, downtown, and shops. The kitchen was well stocked and it was very convenient to run a load of laundry while fixing dinner. I would definitely stay again!"

FYI-The kitchen is very minimal.

It is in very good repair, a lovely washer and dryer, and a great easy to operate T.V. I just can't say enough positive about this place!!! I was in town for business and will try to stay there whenever my schedule allows . The hosts are super friendly and helpful. If you are there for work or pleasure, this is a great starting point!!!"

This place has great style, furnished & decorated beautifully keeping with the integrity of its place in history with all the modern day conveniences. The upper porch that’s part of the unit was great space for my morning yoga along with the chirping of the chicks and hens. The hammock was incredibly relaxing. Trent’s creative and whimsical art was really fun to take in throughout the property. Took in historic downtown Winchester with great shops, restaurants and outdoor band playing, boating and fishing at Frederick lake and celebrated the 4th at Dirt Farm Brewery in Bluemont. We had a great stay!"

From the moment we drove up to the charming colorful entrance with fairy lights, a whimsical ""door to nowhere,"" and well maintained yard, we were enchanted with our surroundings. THEN we entered our suite and were blown away with the retro-looking kitchen appliances and decor throughout. After the sun went down we enjoyed cocktails in the rocking chairs on the upper deck surrounded by the soft glow of lights strung along the banisters. Truly one of the best!"

Stayed with a pet","I had booked this place on a weekend where temperatures plummeted, and many people in the area had pipes that froze. Trent and Nameeta were among those who experienced this type of unforeseen plumbing emergency, and unfortunately I had to cancel my stay. Nameeta called me immediately to let me know what was going on, and was incredibly kind and apologetic. She was in constant contact the whole time, and handled everything with AirBnB as promptly and thoroughly as possible to get me a full refund. She was so considerate, accommodating, and honorable. Although I didn't get to actually stay at this absolutely adorable place, I do hope to book in the future and would recommend booking with these incredibly ethical and good people!"

There were many shady individuals constantly walking around including individuals clearly under the influence of substances (not the fault of the hosts at all, of course). Additionally, there was construction literally right outside the door of the airbnb that has been going on since February and that was never mentioned in the listing. We were woken up by it every morning.
The listing was accurate and the space was clean and furnished nicely."

So many things to love: the awesome kitchen, shower, cool sliding garage doors, super cute nook to drink coffee in, cool lighting, furniture, and the list goes on. If I ever return to Winchester for work, this is where I'll stay.
Note: There is some loud construction going on across the street during daylight hours currently (March 2024). It's not a big deal if you are out during the day, but it made Zoom work meetings a challenge at times during my stay. That being said, construction is temporary AND I loved the place so much, I was willing to forgive the noise."

Stayed a few nights","I will start by saying Steve as a host, was great and responsive while booking. However, if you are booking this, know you are booking it for the history of what it used to be, and the nostalgia of sleeping in an old garage, and that is the experience in and of itself that you are paying for.
This place is LOUD- there was construction we were not made aware of literally across the street that really effected the ability to enjoy this space.
It seems to be a big project that will be going for months, because of this we had jackhammers, and tractors with nonstop noise from 7am-5pm+ even on Saturday morning during our stay.
Even without construction expect it to be noisey as it is on the corner lot of a main road, and across from the train tracks.
If I had known about the construction, and how busy the street in general was, I would have picked a different home to stay in. It is a nice area to walk around and see historical buildings, and little shops.

But not worth the $$ pn"

Stayed with a pet","The place was nice and open, everything was clean as well. It’s perfect for a single retreat or a couple’s getaway, for comfort in the space, I’d say you could fit 3 people max. The area around the place is pretty peaceful, the only downside is where the house is located is a bit noisy since you’re facing the street. As long as you’re aware of that it shouldn’t be too much of a problem. There aren’t too many cooking supplies so just be aware of that👍"

Stayed with a pet","The novelty of a gas station AirBNB- renovations include all of the new and modern amenities you could need. Meticulously clean. Convenient parking. Fast WiFi. Minutes from both Old Town Winchester or a hike. A coffee table book documenting the renovations highlighted the history of the property.
Disclosures:
Noise- Every foot step and conversation can be heard from the upstairs tenant's apartment. Their cat's paw steps and ball/bell toys can even be heard through the floor.
Dog Relief Area- The fenced grass space in front of the AirBNB is not pet friendly. There is a large grass area that the AirBNB host keeps mowed, but it is across N. Cameron St. and backs up to the train tracks. Access requires you to cross with moderate traffic including semi trucks. There is no cross walk/stop light/stop sign. Bring flash lights and reflective gear.
Overall, a unique experience."

Stayed a few nights","Absolutely loved the place, just like the pictures of course. Very cute spot, comfortable bed, loved the shower, and adorable retro kitchen. My only issue is that you can hear everything going on outside. We listened to a man have an hour long convo on the phone. In fact it was so loud it sounded like it was happening in the apartment. I assume this is because of the Garage doors, so there’s not much that can be done. It was just a little scary so we avoided using the living room at night for tv, food, or games. Overall though, everything else was amazing."

We loved being able to walk the Old Town area and charge our car at the apartment. Bedroom is off of the living area, which keeps you from hearing any street noise. We took naps during the day with no problem. The bathroom is large and has a rainfall shower. There's a cool coffee table book of pictures from the renovation of the old station. It's so awesome that they kept the original limestone. You can see the same limestone throughout buildings in the town. Hosts are managing the property really well and super responsive. This is the type of AirBnB that I'll always choose over a hotel. Very memorable experience for my husband and I. Thanks Steve! :)"

Stayed with a pet","I really enjoyed our 5 night stay here with my wife, infant daughter, and dog. It was a truly unique experience and we recommend it to people who want to check out all that Winchester has to offer.
Pros:
- Location. It's a short 7 minute walk to the Pedestrian Mall, which includes tons of restaurants, bars and breweries. Winchester is very walkable, and this is a great jump-off point.
- Design. The renovation was really well-done and it is really fun to stay in a converted gas station. The unit is spacious and you can tell Steve carefully thought out all of the details. One of the coolest places we've ever stayed.
Con:
- Noise. It's on a busy street and close to railroad tracks. There is also a unit above this one and we could hear them walking around a bit. Not too bad, but the noise is something guests should be aware of.
Our Winchester Favs:
- Museum of Shenandoah Valley
- Bonnie Blue
- Pizzoco Pizza (1 block away)
- Vibrissa Beer
- Big L's Bagels
- Walking the Pedestrian Mall"

The space provided everything we needed to enjoy our stay in & around the town of Winchester. Old Town Winchester is just a few minutes' walk from the space and offers a plethora of shops/dining/libations. The old gas pump out front that was retrofitted for EV charging was a great touch! We really enjoyed our bagels from Big L's!!! Just make sure to use the online ordering system lolz"

Stayed a few nights","I had a wonderful stay in Steve's beautifully renovated space; this condo is truly a gem made with love, skill, and charm.
All was as we expected and needed, and the hosts were even kind enough to accommodate our checkout time preference.
I would have loved to have some black out or at least light blocking curtains in the bedroom; the current ones will have you greeting the sun upon its rise whether you care to or not.
Last point worth mentioning-- we would have benefited from using the ceiling fan (or any fan) for white noise and air circulation at least one of the two nights, but we never received a response to our request after reaching out when it didn't work the first night. I would have appreciated at least an acknowledgment even if the fan wasn't repairable.
This wasn't enough to deter me from wanting to enjoy a stay in this amazing space again soon. The space is one of a kind, and the town is quiet and cute!"

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I spent 3 days at 501 Garage after a fun roadtrip up Skyline Drive. I couldn't think of a more fitting place to stay than a converted service station. I loved the repurposed modern look and the attention to detail. We particularly loved the book chronicling the history and redevelopment of the property and opening the bay door to watch the world go by. It was particularly fun to see people passing by craning their neck to see inside, You know you have a great space when people slow down to look.
It was also very convenient that the pedestrian mall was in walking distance. There we found great restaurants and bars with outdoor seating and live music. There we also found museums, boutiques and antique shops.
I love finding unique stay on AB&B and this one certainly did not disappoint."

Stayed a few nights","Steve has created a beautiful place for a weekend getaway for a couple. We really enjoyed all the little details of the converted gas station. As former architects, we appreciated all the work that went into making this a livable and comfortable place. Steve has a good eye for retaining the old (such as the stone walls, polished concrete floors) and adding the new (updated tiling, fixtures, and fittings). We absolutely loved the polished concrete countertop, the industrial lights above it, the retro fridge and microwave, and the gas station related paraphernalia. The kitchen is well-organized with everything one might need. The sofa in the living area is comfortable for lounging and binge watching shows. The bed is also comfortable and the bathroom nicely updated.
We didn't know about the apple blossom festival before we came, but what a pleasant surprise it was. We enjoyed the wine festival and the arts and crafts show. The downtown walking mall is cute and the restaurants are nice."

The thermostat gets nice and cool and there is a large ceiling fan in the bedroom. The location is great - within walking distance to everything you want to see in historic Winchester! Parking is easy as there is a reserved spot right out front. We loved the vibe and I think it’s a really cool experience!

As a Winchester native, it was great to be able to stay in an amazing place with a great location during Apple Blossom. Not to mention the rate is lower than most hotels in the area. Be sure to read the house rules upon arrival. I didn’t know that the garage door is active until my 2nd day. Such a bonus on a nice day. I can’t wait to stay again"

We loved the industrial feel, retro kitchen, beautiful decor, comfortable bed, luxurious rain shower, and other amenities. The high ceilings and amazing frosted-glass garage doors make the space feel large and bright. It's fascinating to view the album with ""before, during, and after"" renovation photos. We parked our car and walked every where. It's just 10 minutes to the downtown pedestrian zone where you can find nice shops and excellent restaurants. Our favorite meal was the most delicious pizza made at Pizzoco (another converted gas station just a block away). We highly recommend staying here when you visit Winchester, VA."

I personally was sensitive to the noise from the upstairs tenants. I mentioned this to Steve on the second day of my stay and he responded promptly and addressed the issue. In reading the reviews, this is not a common complaint, so it might just be me.
If you are visiting this area, or visiting Shenandoah National Park for a weekend of hiking, this is a great spot to stay."

It's the perfect balance of historic charm and modern amenities. The kitchen was well stocked. The claw foot tub, two person shower, and laundry were added bonuses. Our kids really enjoyed the games/toys and the private courtyard made for an easy play space while we sipped coffee (and cocktails). We walked to all that downtown Winchester has to offer - restaurants, kid's museum, theater, boutiques, etc. Matthew was super responsive and gave us some great recommendations.

Bedrooms are cozy and the beds are very comfortable; bath towels are thick and thirsty; kitchen has everything you need to cook and dine-in.
Crystal was great! Let us know that snow was expected the day of our arrival and offered to defer our check-in to the following day. Made sure we arrived safely. And after we checked out, notified us of a small piece of jewelry we had left before we noticed it was missing.
Thank you, we will look to stay here next time we overnight to see the grandkids!"

Both times I’ve stayed in this little gem I’ve been hit by a wave of nostalgia that’s a little hard to describe. It’s an easy, comfortable, welcoming house to visit. The house is absolutely spotless and clutter-free so there’s plenty of room to leave your own stuff out on the tops of dressers or side tables. Everything you need is located in obvious places, the wifi is strong, the beds are great and there are lots of big, fluffy towels. Crystal is approachable and kind in every interaction and couldn’t be more helpful. We will definitely be back! We stuck with Crystal’s restaurant recommendations and thought they were all great – but in particular we loved Chinatown."

Before booking and arriving the rocking chairs on the front porch had captured our attention. We spent many hours reflecting and reminiscing while rocking on the porch. A neighborhood elementary school with lovely trees and expansive yard are just across the street. We even heard the soothing whistle of a few trains which evoked memories of being on our own grandmothers front porches many years ago.
Crystal provided everything we needed as described. The bed sheets were wonderful. The towels soft.
Crystal was informative and flexible and super responsive and helpful.
City Charmer is very cozy, cute and quaint. Just exactly what we were seeking."

This quaint little house was absolutely perfect for our family & we highly recommend if you're staying in the area! Plenty of things to do in the area- we went to the discovery museum & some local restaurants. Grocery stores very close by for anything needed during your stay. Also perfect for walking near the house or in the nearby parks. We also ventured to the caverns that are only about an hour away. I can only imagine how awesome this area would be in the summer!

Crystal was the perfect host; she was not intrusive but very communicative and responsive to questions. We’d definitely stay again.

Stayed a few nights","The cottage with the wrap-around porch is lovely, well-maintained with upgrades. Items that might show wear like bedding and towels appeared very new. I really liked the key-pad entry system, used both for the initial and re-entry. Nice not to bother with keys. Crystal also has replaced the windows allowing for easy opening and closing. I believe the hard-wood flooring was also recently installed so it, like the rest of the house, was very clean. Nice for bare feet!
In a very quiet neighborhood across the street from a grassy area, it's only about a half a mile to old town and even less than that using neighborhood streets to a collection of stores - grocery, hardware, computer, CVS etc. Nice not to drive back out to suburbia or to strip-shopping centers. Incredibly easy to park in the Old Town area so I just drove. Another time I'd seriously consider cutting thru the Old Hebron Cemetery (that includes a section of Confederate graves) for a pleasant walk to the town center.
Crystal was absolutely lovely. We'd had to cancel an earlier visit. She was very gracious about our booking again a few months later. Her brother was kind enough to come by to answer one of my questions. Winchester is a great town with some superb food. We'd absolutely look forward to another visit at the cottage."

Kitchen was well stocked for quick meals, my group particularly enjoyed playing board games at the large dining table. Hosts were very communicative and provided a lot of information about local attractions and restaurants. Exceptional value for the price!"

Stayed with kids","Crystal’s place is the perfect cozy cottage for a Winchester getaway. We wanted to take a few days to just relax before school/work starts getting busy again and to explore a new town. Crystal’s place was absolutely perfect for that. It’s on a quiet tree-lined side street with plenty of street parking across from an elementary school. It’s also a 4 minute drive or 15 minute walk from the adorable historic walkable part of Winchester that’s full of cute shops and restaurants. It’s very close to both major highways and scenic routes.
The house is a beautifully restored 1950s cottage with a lovely large wraparound porch with comfortable rocking chairs and a wide roof - it’s perfect for sitting and relaxing with a great book or enjoying a chat or just people watching. It was great in both sunshine and rain because the roof is wide enough to provide shade/rain protection. You enter into a lovely living room with some chairs and a comfy couch (which also folds out). The dining room and kitchen are well stocked with utensils/plates/cups/cookware as well as a Keurig and a tea kettle. There are spices/oil, etc. for cooking. Everything is spotless, and while the counters and sink are clearly new, the cabinets are really well restored originals which lends a nice touch to the house. There’s a super clean bathroom with soft fuzzy towels (and some mini soaps and shampoos in case you forget yours). The two bedrooms have comfortable soft beds with lots of pillows. And there’s a fantastic large backyard with a little patio that has a table/chairs and pretty fairy lights that come on at dusk! The AC works well in the entire house (we came in summer, so it was important!), and there’s a ceiling fan in the kitchen, too.
Crystal is super communicative and answers any questions you have very quickly, but doesn’t hover needlessly - excellent combo in an AirBnB host!
The town is lovely - highly recommend Bonnie Blue BBQ for brunch, Water Street Kitchen for dinner, and Red Fox Creamery for ice cream and milkshakes. The nearby Museum of the Shenandoah Valley is a delightful surprise - just a few minutes away, it boasts a historic home, lovely gardens, and the actual museum which has contemporary art, an exhibit on the history of the valley (from paleo-Indians to present day), and a marvelous room of beautiful miniature houses - think dollhouses but a million times more exquisite. The museum is also surrounded by a series of walking trails which are free and open to the public morning to dusk. Finally, if you’re in the mood for fresh produce, the Marker-Miller Orchard is a few miles away and has a fabulous market, pick your own fruit, a children’s playground, and a huge porch full of rocking chairs where you can sit and enjoy the view of the Blue Ridge mountains.
We had a fabulous stay and would highly recommend it to others!"

We loved sitting on the porch in the early morning and evenings with friendly neighbors and passerbys. Having laundry on-site was a major bonus for a traveling family. Instructions for guests were on point, and daily communication from these Superhosts was wonderful. 10 stars!!!"

As a historian, the house just delighted my heart. The interior color, decor, furniture and appliances are all modern, but the structure of the house is original and complete with arched frames, originalhardware and light fixtures. It's the perfect blend of past and present. The house is located across the street from an elementary school and slightly less than a mile from Old Town Winchester and its many restaurants and shops. The house is spotlessly clean and perfectly appointed in every way even to the point of labeling the kitchen cabinets to know what's inside. The house is cozy and has an excellent front porch for morning coffee and back yard for wine at night. Check in and check out was quick and easy. Crystal was quick to communicate before, during and after our stay. The house was perfect for a Mom/Daughter trip and my Mom and I were indeed charmed by the city charmer!"

The cottage was simple, and felt like a place where we would love to come and spend a week just enjoying the quiet and beauty.
Our host accommodated our request to send the door code in a way that we were able to get it in spite of limited cell phone reception, something that we very much appreciated, and made our check-in much easier.
We really appreciated the tasteful renovations that had been done in keeping with the spirit of the house, and showed love for its history and architecture. We would love to come and stay here again."

I was on my to my daughter's in Soffolk, VA and this sweet cottage was the 1/2 way point. My girlfriend lives an hour north so I invited her to meet me there for a mini getaway. We went on one outing and headed over Old Lucketts Store! It was only 45 minutes away!
I'm a bit of a foodie and picked this cottage over one closer to Lucketts because it had a real kitchen. It did not disappoint. It was well equipped!
The place was very clean, cozy and inviting! I always look for places with comfy seating...the sofa and side chairs were perfect!

Stayed one night","Heaven. This home represents the best of what I believe Airbnb was meant to be. A home away from home, shared by people who love and care for that home. This home provides a traveler with a unique experience that can’t be found at a hotel, motel or bed and breakfast. It is apparent that these home owners love this place and I am not surprised that Jenny and Matt are super hosts. Everything you need is here. No extra charge for the soul nourishing peace and quiet, the beautiful bird songs and the feeling of being nestled in the woods. You won’t want to leave. My wish for future guests is that you feel as blessed as we did here and that you care for it as well as these hosts do who are sharing something quite remarkable."

We enjoyed motorcycle riding in Northern Virginia with winding roads and beautiful roads ... returning to the cottage for rest and relaxation. The interior was well laid out with a modern rustic decor. We loved the high ceilings, comfortable beds, the access to a washer/dryer, the tractor grill in the fireplace ... just everything! The front porch was amazing - comfortable and quiet. There were hundreds of lightning bugs in the nearby trees and some fox kits playing on the edge of the yard. It was just perfect!

Stayed a few nights","This is a really nice little house! We stayed there as a couple and that's perfect. There is a second bedroom but the house appears a bit small for a group at least in winter when you have to spend time inside. It is probably suitable for a family though. Everything was perfectly clean and cozy.
The fireplace is not for use (which is written in the house rules), just in case this is sth you care about."

Our evenings were cozy and chill in their comfy living room. There is a really awesome fire ring in the yard to relax near. The loft is more of an upstairs bedroom with a chair in the corner that makes the most amazing reading nook. Would definitely stay again!

It provided peaceful surroundings, and a good night's sleep after a long day on the road. This will more than likely become our stay of choice in the future. (We have already recommended it to family members.)"

It was further from downtown Winchester than I had thought, but that wasn’t a problem for me. My only complaint, if you could say that, was no smart tv and limited programming. There was a small selection of DVDs which I took advantage of. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay!!"

We got to drink hot tea and read our books on the couch as the sun set. It snowed so the scenery was picture perfect. Being surrounded by trees, it was secluded enough to feel serene but close enough to other homes to still feel safe. Perfect getaway from the city!

Stayed a few nights","Crystal's house is spacious with 2.5 baths and 3 bedrooms. My husband, two adult sons, and I came to Winchester for a wedding and made use of all of the bedrooms. The spacious master has an en suite bath. The master bedroom bed was very comfortable. (I forgot to ask my son's how their beds were.)
We used the kitchen for preparing breakfast, lunches, and for cooking dinner one of our three nights. Upstairs is carpeted. Crystal left bottled water in fridge, as well as a gallon of water for use with Keurig. She also provided coffee for the Keurig and a few chocolates. Very thoughtful!
Crystal had many brochures for sites of potential interest which was very helpful. We especially enjoyed the Museum of Shenandoah Valley--for its museum, as well as the grounds for walking and viewing outdoor sculptures.
I was glad I had brought my own cutting board, because I didn't find one. We also had to provide our own tissue boxes."

Stayed a few nights","When we chose this house, we knew it would be a great stay, because we've stayed at Crystal's other house. I wanted a quiet place in which we could spread out, as we were attending our son's wedding. I loved all the huge closets! Plenty of places to hang our garment bags and store multiple suitcases, pairs of shoes, purses, centerpieces, etc. The large kitchen table made a great workspace and staging area. I was afraid we wouldn't have quiet nights because there's a neighborhood dog that barks on and off throughout the day (I guess because the owners are at work), but it was no problem at night. Crystal made a great recommendation for a post-wedding breakfast, which we hosted for 34 people at Bonnie Blue's Southern Market. It's a gem of a place. We highly recommend Crystal's house and hosting!"

The house was perfect and toddler-safe 100%. My toddler felt at home with all the amenities for him (which other places lack and have so many things they can break). I will definitely check if this place is available again next year. God bless you Crystal and all of your family ❤️.

We arrived to find a clean, fully furnished home. It was home away from home. Ghiradelli chocolates, and a welcome board was such a thoughtful, and welcoming touch. There was also a board posted in the kitchen with local resteraunts for eat in and or delivery. The back yard was exceptionally quiet and peaceful. I really just needed a few more days for R&R, and to grill some kabobs!
Lots of things to do and places to go within a 1 hour drive or less. Chrystal was a very responsive and helpful host during our stay. I highly recommend Chrystals place! You will not be disappointed. On my next trip to VA I plan to reserve her place again!"

The rooms were nice and clean. The location is great as it's right off the highway and close to many places in the Winchester area. The bonus for us is that we were only 10 minutes away from the wedding venue. We didn't get to enjoy the back porch because of time, but it looked like a great set up if you wanted to spend time outside. Overall, Crystal was a great host and very responsive.

Group trip","When we drove to Winchester to check in this a house, the host didn't gave us correct address. The street name was right but house number was wrong.
The house address they gave to us wasn't match with picture of house. The host gave us next door address.
We had to emailed them and got correct address after a while.
I wish that the host give us direct contact phone numbers so easy to contact and get information as we need.
In my past experience, other host we had offed direct contact phone numbers when close to check in.
We enjoyed this Winchester a house but a house seems needed interior painting. The walls in this a house has lots of marks and it needs painting.
The house location was good. It was closed enough for my son's wedding place and shopping retail stores.
It was nice that this a house has washer and dryer.
This house didn't have shower stuffs as other houses provided shampoo, conditioner and soap bar but I rather use my own stuffs anyway.
This a house has one king size bed in master bedroom, one double bed on 2nd bedroom and two double beds in 3rd bedroom. All rooms are in second floor with two full bathrooms. The first floor has half bathroom.
This a house was plenty size for three of us.
If you go visit Winchester, I still would recommend this a house.
The neighbors seems safe."

Also it’s always important to be in a clean space, but she did a stellar job of making it clean and feel super safe which is particularly important, especially right now!
Crystal was very fast to respond, incredibly helpful, and kind when I asked last minute for a bit more time before checkout!
The only bad thing I could say is that we were kicking ourselves for not booking for longer! Definitely hope to make it back again. Thanks Crystal!!!"

We had pets & there was concern but I made sure I cleaned it before we left and we chatted which made it all good :) We loved the place, it was exactly like the photos. Down town was very close to walk too for a drink, food, and shopping. Lots of beautiful trails to hike only a short drive away. We had to walk the dogs a little bit away to an open lawn area which was no problem. At night it had homeless people, & some sketchy activities but no bothered us, Everyone left us alone & by the end of our stay our pups were known by all :). Neighbors in buildings next to the air bnb not so friendly. One lady cursed at us when my dog stepped into her grass from back parking lot and for the rest of our stay she gave dirty looks, & when my daughter was outside she’d make snorting noises. Michele & air bnb was perfect other than that neighbor :) Definitely would stay again!"

The queen bed was comfortable, but that room could really use its own ac unit. The 2nd bedroom has its own unit, but Our guests said that bed was very uncomfortable. The unit in the living area kept that area really cool. The kitchen was well stocked."

The place is two blocks from the Winchester main drag with restaurants and shops. Check out the library - beautiful Beaux Arts architecture and quirky-interesting."

That was also the case with this property and the short walk to downtown Winchester was a highlight, as well as the decorative touches at the property itself. Michele's communications, flexibility and friendliness have always been excellent. For this particular rental Michele went above and beyond her responsibilities as a host by returning an item of clothing I left behind to a relative of mine who lives approximately 1 hour away. Excellent service and a wonderful property!"

The views of the mountains and trees were spectacular along with the cows grazing.

Group trip",Loved this big old farm house for our girls weekend getaway. It was quiet and peaceful yet still close enough to go do shopping and grab dinner downtown. The bedrooms are huge and the beds comfortable. The kitchen was a bit small but honestly we didn’t cook so it was the perfect size for us and our snacks lol. We made the bath and a half work. There is a working garage out back but the gentleman that works there was very friendly and kept to himself. Loved the extra touch of a jar of homemade apple butter. Kay was also very flexible on my check in when I thought I would be a couple hours early- ended up only being about 30 minutes early but appreciated being able to get in when we arrived. All in all we enjoyed our stay. It’s so much better than staying in a hotel!

It is an old house, so there are some quirks, but the house is so charming and full of character, and the beautiful country views cannot be beat! We felt refreshed and blessed just to be there. The pear tree in the back yard had ripe pears on it, which made for a yummy treat. We enjoyed reading the information about the history of the house, and coming from a large extended family we loved the fact that the farm is kept up by seven cousins.
Kay was a wonderful and gracious hostess from beginning to end. There was a jar of homemade apple butter on the table to welcome us--it was delicious! We were in town for a wedding, and Kay let us have some additional family over for a brunch the next day. One of my cousins left a coat, and Kay let us know and mailed it to us."

Super clean! Even though we used all five bedrooms, we didn’t find the one and a half bathrooms to be an issue since half our party only stayed one night. (Having just the one shower might be a bit of an issue for a large group expecting daily showers for all.)

It was so quiet and peaceful and about 15 minutes from everything. It was relaxing to come back there each night after the busyness of our daughter/niece/granddaughter's wedding events and sight seeing activities.
The house was cozy and charming - very homey. We didn't cook much but the kitchen was well-stocked. The beds were comfortable and there was plenty of hot water and good pressure in the shower. We were also glad for air conditioning since we had some hot days. Overall, we were very happy. Thanks for a great week !"

They do have spares but as a bigger family, we wouldn’t have minded more.
The place is stocked with condiments and tons of cookware/pans etc which was great and meant we could cook on site. The town area is only 10-15 minutes away, so things are close even though it is remote. Our family will certainly be back!"

Stayed with kids",The house and location was absolutely beautiful! We wish we got to explore the property more during our stay! We were in town for the wedding of our brother and sister in-law anlld Kay was so wonderful and gracious to let us host the rehearsal dinner there as well! Lady Bug was a huge hit with our family and she was so sweet! We did have to clean up after her which wasn't expected and less than ideal but we have our own pup at home so it wasn't something out of ordinary for us to have to do. We loved our stay and are very appreciative of Kay and all of her communication and understanding!

Stayed with kids","Kay's house is situated in a lovely, quiet spot in the outskirts of Winchester. We had no trouble at all finding the place. Inside, it is clean, spacious and inviting. The house rules were clearly stated and easy to abide by. Kay herself was warm and welcoming, and a lightning-fast communicator. Would recommend this place to a family or couple of families looking for a quiet retreat. We hope to stay again sometime soon."

Stayed with kids","The house has incredible 19th Century charm. A lot of cozy rooms with a lot of family feel to it. The house is immaculate. Clean and in great physical condition. The linens and towels were clean and of high quality.
Kay was incredibly responsive and generous with her time.
There are 5 bedrooms and 1.5 baths, a good sized kitchen, formal dining room, living room and solarium all situated on a working honey farm. Great porch and grounds to relax on.
Close to Winchester. Very quiet."

Stayed with kids","An entirely charming country home in the absolutely lovely area of the foothills of west Winchester. We were amazed at the historical items inside this 5 bedroom home. We discovered the front porch on the third day and spent most of the day there. Nice breeze, American flag, great views of the rolling hills and distant Appalachia. Just wonderful and idyllic. My kids wanted to buy this home! There you go."
