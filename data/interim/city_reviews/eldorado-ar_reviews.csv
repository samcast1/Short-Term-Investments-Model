Stayed with kids","My family visited for a graduation, we had a wonderful time,great experience very clean home, beautiful spacious back yard ,quit/peaceful and private. There is no tv in the rooms but no big deal we brought our projector for at night and used the wall for the screen connected it to our laptop it worked our just fine. This host was very responsive and the instructions were easy to follow. We didn’t encounter any issues during our stay. There was a gas station right across the street and Walmart 7-10min away. I highly recommend this host we will definitely revisit this place every time we visit Arkansas. If in doubt don’t be it’s worth it book this host. 10/10"

Stayed with kids","We enjoyed our stay. The house was perfect for our family. Very clean and cozy. The town had an issue with their sewer system so we ended up cutting our stay short, but Manpreet was on top of trying to figure out the problem and a solution. We couldn't have asked for a better host! We look forward to returning in the future!"

Stayed a few nights","Manpreet was a great host! Responded quickly to my request, and also responded quickly if I messaged while we were in Camden. The only complaint is that the walls are thin and that neighborhood is very noisy.
Not a complaint, but noteworthy - both beds are firm, as well as the living-room furniture, but they are all also immaculately clean!"

Stayed a few nights","Absolutely beautiful home. We would definitely stay again. Home was clean and provided all the necessary supplies. We loved the personal touch. The only thing that could have been better was the grass was not cut other than that it was perfect. Large back yard and plenty of space on the inside. You you are a person that enjoys a tv in the bedroom, there is no tv in neither bedroom but that was ok for us."

Stayed a few nights","Found the location very easily. I had a little trouble understanding the code for the building, but that was more my fault. The kitchen had dishes in the sink, so I put them away. The building is very old and there are several very nice tenants living there but unfortunately a few smoke, you could smell the smoke inside the room. Having the room next to the road made sleeping a little tough, you can hear the vehicles as they pass by. Otherwise, this wasn't a bad place, just a few issues that could be resolved."

Stayed one night","This place was very clean and comfortable and easy to access. It was perfect for a quick overnight stay on a long road trip. I think the only thing that could be improved upon is better lighting when parking outside. I couldn't park in the front of the building where it was better lit due to it being a full parking lot. I had to park on the side, where it was quite dark at night. Luckily, I figured out that the window above the bed looks out directly on the parking area where I parked my car, so I could literally park directly under my bedroom window and have my car right outside a few feet away. I would definitely stay here again if I were passing through town and needed a quick overnight stay in the future."

The house is very pleasant and I felt at home right away. Of course much of that was due to the warm welcome I received from Jamie, the host. He greeted me, showed me around and made sure I had everything I needed, including taxi numbers (I don’t drive) and then the house was mine for the next three days.
I was able to avail myself of the washer and dryer and cook which was much appreciated as traveling involves a lot of take out and carrying around dirty clothes.
I was happy with how clean the house was and delighted my host had made the effort to be available for any questions.
I would stay here again. Definitely."

Group trip","1st off, Janice is a very bubbly and welcoming host! She is very communicative and is always ready to help. The home was way more spacious than I expected, I found myself frequently staring at the living room in awe of how large it is. There’s tons of sitting room and the place just feels ‘homey’. The antique nature of the home, plus Miss Janice’s unique taste in interior design gives the home a refreshing air of mystery. It is the perfect place for a mens retreat. I even wrote my vows for my wedding in the office study.
The only real “drawback” for the home, is that it wasn’t built with more bedrooms. The place feels like it wants to hold minimum 8-9 people comfortably.
My stay here will be etched in my memories forever, my wedding weekend would not have been what it was without this home. Thank you Miss Janice, for your kindness and hospitality!"

The lawn is extra large, too. Our dog enjoyed his daily outings. We enjoyed sitting on the porch listening to the birds and watching the squirrels (so did our dog). Janice was a wonderful host - she brought breakfast goodies at check-in (she came to meet us and show us around the house) and even shared a watermelon with us! She is such a generous and friendly person. Meeting her was such a treat and it made us feel like we really were staying in ""her"" home."

The den is huge and seats at least 16 people I would guess. There’s also a very cool outdoor deck the length of the back of the house. There are 4 lovely bedrooms and and an office. There are two beautiful Midcentury dining room tables that 6-8 and a kitchen breakfast area. Upscale kitchen appliances including a chef’s dream induction cooktop. This is just a stunning home and I would rent it again just to study the beautiful architecture of the home and the artwork inside.
The grounds are beautiful too.
A 2 car carport and fantastic privacy on a street that has one way in. One of the loveliest in El Dorado.
The description doesn’t do the house justice!
Janice is an incredible host and a wealth of knowledge about the home and town.

It was easy to find and Janice met us there to go over everything and was just a message away if needed.

It was so relaxing to sit on the deck and watch the birds. Location was great! Can walk down the streets of the quiet neighborhood or hop in your car and be in town in 5 min. Everyone slept great. So glad we found this gem!"

Stayed a few nights","We had a loss in the family and wanted a place to stay that was more accommodating than a hotel. This place was a dream!
The details of the home are amazing! There is a piano we played church hymns on. So much room. We were so comfortable and in 60plus years of coming to my mother's home town, we've NEVER been this at home!!! We did not want to leave!
I've never rented a home where I did not need to bring any essentials. Given the reason we were here, we didn't pack very well. This host and home provided everything we needed. It is sooooo quiet. We needed that! The floor was so smooth and cold on the bottom of our feet. We actually kicked off our house shoes to enjoy it! There are different types of lighting everywhere. The house is so big you can section it off with lights and have your personal time while the family sleeps. The bathtub recesses into the floor with a slight slant for soaking. My Favorite! This home also provided a handicap accessible shower!!!! A God Send for my father-in-law. There are so many toilets.....no waiting! The fireplace sitting area is a dream. The iron work radiates beauty. The kitchen has a soundproof ceiling!!!! I found a 100 year old Sears and Roebuck Catalog Book! We looked and admired the photos from when the home was built. You can see the proudness in the families eye's and what a lovely family. The sliding doors to the outside are smooth and quiet. The backyard is absolutely stunning! Just sit and watch. You have your own live nature show! Hummingbirds, woodpeckers, deer! The host, Ms. Janice, made sure my family was comfortable. She stayed in contact with me. She even phoned to make sure my elderly father in law was doing ok within the home. She truly cares. There is also a lower bed for which my father used due to knee surgery, he had no problem getting in and out of bed nor to the restroom. You feel so safe while you are there. We are in love with this home and we will definitely be coming back! Thank you Janice for everything! We really were at home.

The floors were filthy, there were no batteries in the TV remote, but mainly, both beds had no mattress pad, just plastic around the mattress and a thin sheet.

This could be a great place with a little TLC."

I was also disappointed that once we arrived after 10:00 p.m., we realize that there was nothing in the kitchen for morning coffee, so we had to go back out to get coffee and filters. then when we got ready to make coffee the following morning, the coffee maker still had coffee in the bottom of it.

Stayed with a pet","We come to El Dorado twice a year and want a space that accomodates our small dog. This unit is in a very old complex in older part of town.
Pros: Convenient to town, good space, nice flooring, easy to enter, one level, A/C works well, good hot water in shower, quiet, nice TV with streaming shows, internet. Plenty of toilet paper and paper towels.
Cons: Unit was very hot and musty upon entering. Did not feel it was prepared for us. Unit needs a deep clean with new rugs, clean walls and baseboards. Washer and dryer work but handle broken on dryer. Both need to be cleaned. Found a few hairs on walls, toilet, and comforters. Towels were few and thin, no kitchen towels at all. No hangers or hair dryer. No luxury touches that we have seen on most similar units were have used with AirB/B. The coffee maker is small and does not get very hot.
Would stay here again if the cons are resolved. Appreciated the stay."

Stayed a few nights","There are a lot of things that I really enjoyed about staying the two nights at this airbnb.
There were welcome snacks and two Sprites. Inside the nice large refrigerator there were several bottles of water, and the ice maker was very good. The kitchen had pretty granite countertops, a huge farm sink, a large five burn stove, a keurig with lots of k cups, every kind of pot needed for cooking, nice dishes, glasses, cups, several different kind of dry goods, salt and pepper, olive oil, etc.
The television was awesome and very easy to use. The key code was very easy to remember. There were many towels, hand towels, and wash cloths to use. They have large capacity washer and dryer, iron, ironing board, even laundry baskets. The plug for the internet was very near the bed which made it easy to use. The ceiling fans in most rooms were wonderful and the air conditioning was perfect. In the bathroom, they had cotton balls, q-tips, and name-brand shampoo and conditioner. It has a nice front porch and a small screened in back porch. The bathroom door is a barn door and even under the vanity there is a tiny barn door to open it. As you can tell, I really enjoyed my stay. And the host was wonderful. I could not have been more happy."

Stayed with a pet","First of all, I want to say that Gregory as a host was phenomenal. Our problem was that the Airbnb didn’t meet our expectations. Gregory cannot control his neighbors. The house across the street is falling apart and the next door neighbor is a hoarder. As a female that usually travels solo, I would definitely not feel safe. Thankfully, I had my husband and dogs with us. A couple small problems and Gregory was addressing the issues immediately after we informed him.
The price is probably fair for the area, our expectations were higher due to all the great reviews. The price is probably a better indication of the area.
Thank you for your help Gregory."

Stayed with kids","It was everything my boyfriend wanted and more during his escape from the hustle and bustle of hauling concrete in DFW. My son had NO ANXIETY which was a blessing he is a 3yr old with ASD. The pictures, the decor, it feels like a home that was steeped in love throughout the years, truly. We wished we could have spent more time enjoying the home than visiting family. Amazing hosts! Amazing job! We are still in awe at how it checked every box on the list of things we wanted and needed for our short getaway. Thank you Beverlee and Keith your home was truly a home to us."

This cottage would standout in any setting! The amenities were just what we needed for such a family trip as this ... spacious, quiet, full kitchen and multiple bathrooms. I would rate Beverlee's listing a 4.7/5, will definitely recommend and look forward to returning for another stay."

Stayed a few nights","From the moment I opened the side door off the car port of Killgore Cottage I was in awe. Attention to decore, ambience and cleanliness were immediately apparent. On a stifling Louisiana day the house was enticingly cool with AC and ceiling fans running. As I moved through the house lamps provided a dimly lit path revealing a collection of vintage treasures and the overhead light switches. It was apparent I was both expected and being invited in.
As a lone traveller I felt safe in Killgore cottage and in the residential neighborhood I temporarily joined.
I found it ideally situated for my purpose and during the hottest part of the August days a welcoming retreat.
From condiments to soaps and cleaning supplies so many extras were provided.
I left Haynesville contentedly knowing I have a cozy Louisiana home to return to on my next visit.
Beverlee and Keith are amazing hosts; they’re friendly and welcoming, very responsive to communication and considerate of guest privacy."

I’m from Ecuador, and had sticker shock daily on this trip! But the cottage felt worth the money during a trip that I may not be able to make again! I’m 76 yrs old, and the trip from Ecuador was really hard. But Beverly and the good people of Haynesville gave me peace and comfort❤️ thank you! Thanks to Jimmy Dale Williams too 🥰

It was truly special to stay in Haynesville, the home of our ancestors, and being able to stay in this wonderful home with all the amenities one could ever think to need, with the additional feeling of true Southern living, well, it doesn't get any better than that! So any other descendants of Haynesville or anyone visiting Northern Louisiana - this is a must stay! Beverlee ... you 've done your town proud! Thank you from all of us - we will definitely be back!"

Stayed with kids","This is a super cute, recently remodeled, fully stocked for a long term stay, three bedroom home, located about 2 blocks from a park and almost in the middle of the tiny town. The front porch is perfect for sipping your favorite beverage and watching the neighbors drive by. The screened in back porch is shaded by a large tree and presents a relaxed place to contemplate. The large back yard, shaded by the same tree is a wonderful place to do yoga & watch the neighborhood birds. Basically everyone is friendly and will wave at you as you sit on the porch, walk around town, or talk to you if you run into them at the Piggly Wiggly. There are a handful of restaurants in town one can support. The downtown area has great potential. I personally feel that if the town had a few festivals during the year, perhaps a farmers market (not sure if I missed one), got the downtown spiced up with perhaps local artists, farmers, beekeepers, lemonade stands..whatever the peoples talents are, this town could be even more amazing. From this cute home to the church bells ringing throughout the day to the trains that slowly pass thru town, occasionally blowing their whistles, & the wonderful people. You may just want to stay longer. : )"

We learned from Jesse the building started life as a sno-cone stand before he moved it to the current location and completely renovated the inside. The outdoor kitchen added living space and we enjoyed many meals at the dining table. The house is only a few miles from Homer, and the Herbert S. Ford Memorial Museum in the former Hotel Claiborne on the downtown square is worth a visit. Jesse was quick to respond to our queries and was very flexible when we had travel issues due to weather. We will definitely return to Jesse's."

Stayed a few nights",Jesse’s place was nice and cozy! The outdoor kitchen was awesome. Communication with him was easy and we enjoyed our trip. My son had a high school fishing tournament on the lake and this was a perfect place for us to stay and spend some time fishing for the weekend.

Stayed with a pet",Jesse was a great host! We enjoyed a peaceful and quiet weekend getaway. The house was great and there was a big backyard with a great view of the lake. Jesse made us feel very welcomed and was very easy to get ahold of to answer any questions. We plan on returning soon

Stayed over a week","Great place to stay!! Quiet and away from town , great way to wind down from a busy day. The pictures don't do it justice, very clean and cozy. There was no water when I stayed but still very peaceful and the outdoor kitchen is a great place to cook and enjoy a day off. I would definitely recommend staying here everything else in the area is more expensive and not as nice. I will be staying here again"

Stayed over a week",My husband works on the road so this was a long term stay. He was there approximately 3 months and the place was perfect for what we needed (I went and stayed a few times). The view of the birds flying across the water is amazing to wake up to. Loved being able to walk out the back door on to the private dock to go fishing. The outdoor patio area had everything you could possibly need to cook outside and enjoy the scenery. The neighbors were really nice and the neighborhood is very quiet. The house itself is literally a tiny home but has pretty much everything you need. If I had to make one suggestion for folks staying any length of time is to get yourself a portable clothes hanging rack because it doesn’t have a closet. But the rack worked out great. Jesse was a fantastic host and was very responsive to the gazillion questions I always had. I’ve stayed in many AirBnBs before but I’m actually going to miss this place.We will probably try to rent it again for a long weekend sometime.

Stayed with kids","My wife and I were just looking for a nice place to do some bass fishing for the weekend and stumbled upon this beautiful tiny home. Jesse was a great host, he made sure we were taken care of. He knew we wanted to go fishing and purchased a second Kayak, just so that we were comfortable. The pictures that are listed on this property do it zero justice. This place is beyond amazing! The outdoor area is gorgeous and the amenities, especially for a tiny home are impeccable. Definitely look forward to booking again. If you are questioning it, please just do it. Well worth the money spent. Thank you Jesse and the Witt Family!"

Great floor plan with two full bathrooms. Only downsides were unimpressive mattress quality and short sofa. I would recommend this one to others."

Her place said no refunds on cancellation’s so it was very nice of her to make an exception for me. It’s a wonderful little apartment and close to the center of town. Will stay again if I’m ever back in the area!!

Amy is a great host and her accommodations were just what we needed for our trip. We'll definitely look her up, when visiting family again❤️ Thank you much. Amy."
