Stayed a few nights","This air bnb was cute and cozy. Just be aware that it is right across the street from a gas station, there are blinds on the windows for privacy but no curtains. There should be black out curtains because it is so bright in the room. I would bring an eye mask and ear plugs since there is traffic and the house is at an intersection. The host was very responsive."

Stayed with a pet",We had an absolute blast staying at Taylor's! The cabin is gorgeous as is the area. It's very close to everything Kerrville has to offer yet still in very country area. Taylor has supplied the cabin with everything one could possibly need and then some. We loved the Keurig coffee pot! The entire cabin was spotless. Taylor does a fantastic job hosting!!! We're old fogies and had a little trouble figuring out the Roku; pro-tip: HDMI 2 (not 1). 😂👵👴 THANK YOU TAYLOR!

Stayed a few nights","This cabin was one of the most comfortable Airbnb stays we have had, nothing fussy, just a well organized home. We were traveling with our golden retriever who enjoyed sitting for hours on the porch...we had to drag her off when it was time to leave! There is a great dog park in town and afterwords took our pup to the fountains where she tried to catch the water jetting up. One day we drove to Lost Maples park and did a beautiful hike. We cooked all of our meals in the cabin, did our laundry, and enjoyed watching movies at night from their comfortable couch. Unlike our other hosts, they take care of all cleanup (no stripping sheets, etc). A great value and a great find."

Though I was able to navigate the steps with help, I would like to have been aware of the steps before booking. Otherwise, Taylor was a gracious host and we have nothing but good to say about our host. We really enjoyed our stay."

This location exactly fit what we were looking for. It was an extremely comfortable cabin. It was quiet. We felt like we got away. Kerrville was nice, but very quiet. We were looking for place to hike and the town has a couple of nice options. We highly recommend this cabin and Kerrville for a relaxing get out of town."

Stayed about a week","The most relaxing vacation I've had in a long time. In many ways better than more ""major"" trips, like cruises, visits to big cities, etc. Taylor was a gracious host. She was quick to respond when I had a question, and very respectful of our privacy.
We were able to visit Fredericksburg, take some hikes, found a few fossils, and had a perfect view of the annular eclipse.
This region of Texas has its own allure. My first time visiting the Hill Country. Found it charming.
The closest thing to a negative has nothing to do with Taylor or the venue. I drive a Tesla, and the nearest Superchargers are in Junction, Johnson City, or Leon Springs, all 40-50 miles away. As with any long trip in a Tesla, (I drove 1200 miles from home) plan accordingly. It's just Texas is so big that what looks like a short distance on a map can turn out to be further than expected. Kerrville is big enough and busy enough to have a Supercharger location."

The faux wood burning stove is actually surprisingly cozy!
Private. Hosts were helpful, responsive, professional.
Toilet leaked on the floor. Host tried really hard to fix it before we checked in, delaying our check in. But it leaked again during our stay. Once they fix the toilet this would be a perfect getaway place for a week or a month."

We weren't familiar with the TV programming provided, but Taylor responded immediately to demonstrate. We look forward to staying at the cabin when we next visit Hill County."

Stayed with kids","This was the perfect weekend getaway to the Texas Hill Country. We needed an escape from the hustle and bustle of Houston and this was rejuvenating to be around such beautiful scenery. The place was fully equipped with all kitchen items, bathroom items, linens, etc. that you might need. The decor was beautiful as well. We have 2 boys under 3 and the house was very baby safe. The grounds were gorgeous. The best thing was that the place was exceptionally clean. We’ve stayed in a lot of rentals and this was the cleanest by far. You could eat off any surface (don’t worry we didn’t)! We will definitely be back! 10/10 recommend!"

Stayed with a pet","Super cute, clean place in a lovely neighborhood. As others have mentioned, you are next to the main house, but you have a great deal of privacy nonetheless with how the houses are positioned. It was a pretty 10-15 min drive into Kerrville. The only worrisome moment we had was their dog ran up and barked at us when we were sitting on the porch with my dog. Taylor was really responsive and apologetic when I asked her about the dog and says they usually are really careful about keeping an eye on him when guests are there and that he is friendly. We had a great stay, though, loved the cabin, and found Taylor very responsive and nice."

Stayed a few nights","The location, just a few miles outside downtown Ingram was secluded. The views were great; neighbor's peacocks calling each night give it an exotic feel. Note: with the windows closed, I couldn't hear them at all.
The HVAC controls were simple to use.
WiFi was fast as described but disconnected from the Internet during the wee late night hours (e.g., 2 AM). This is likely an ISP's modem ""feature."" The solution was to restart WiFi on my phone/device which would trigger the modem to reconnect to the Internet.
It'd rained during two days of our stay and the laundry machines got some use. Both the washer and dryer were quiet and convenient.
The bathroom and kitchen were clean.
The rooms had plenty of closet space and hangers but I'd recommend adding a dresser or something with drawers for small clothes.
We appreciated the Keurig and the assortment of coffees.
Overall, a good value and would recommend to others."

She left out snacks for us and dog treats for our babies. You do not need to bring shampoo or conditioner or soap she has all that put out for you and everything you would need to cook . My only suggestion would be that she needs to put up blinds in the front windows and a curtain over door window to give guest more privacy. Would definitely stay again thanks for having us !

I thought it was a great value and would definitely stay here again if my travels take me back to Kerrville."

Stayed with kids","We were looking for a location with darker skies to use our telescope and try to see some cool astronomical objects. Taylor's Kerrville cabin was a great location, far darker than where we live, and we had good viewing of star clusters, a couple of nebulas, Saturn, Jupiter, etc. etc.
During the days, we hiked at Enchanted Rock and did some exploring in Fredericksburg (the Pacific War Museum is amazing). The cabin's location is quiet and peaceful and very beautiful. The cabin interior is exactly as depicted, with charming knotty pine and lots of windows. The main living/kitchen area is one big open space, which is the perfect layout when you're on vacation. It was comfy and also very clean and tidy. Taylor and her husband were both super kind and helpful. We had a great stay here!"

The internet worked flawlessly and there is a great selection of DVD's. My husband loved the assorted flavored coffees while watching the wildlife from the front porch in the early mornings. There is also a large selection of spices in the kitchen and fresh herbs were growing on the windowsill. Taylor is a great host - available if you need anything, but otherwise leaving you to your privacy. This was the perfect getaway from city life! We plan to return upon our next visit to Kerrville!"

Stayed with a pet","If you want a peaceful quiet place to enjoy the beauty of the Texas Hill Country, this is it. You are about12-15 minutes to the center of Kerrville, but the magnificent views really makeup for any additional travel time. The space is perfect for families with 3 big bedrooms, new comfortable beds and sprawling yards. Your pets will enjoy the fully enclosed yard area. The decks and outside spaces are wonderful.
If you're looking for easy access to bars and restaurants, this is probably not for you. If you want to enjoy the beauty of nature in a comfortable convenient space. This is for you."

The bathtub in the master suite was a particularly wonderful perk and worth the price alone. Steve and Cathy were super sweet and responded so quickly to every message I sent.

The kitchen was so clean and new. We also grilled out on the lighted porch at night. It was just so pretty.
The big trees in the back are a host for beautiful bird watching. We were able to watch hummingbirds up close as they fed near us. Everything was a real treat in the house. We had a little dog, 15 lbs, and found the house to be pet friendly and safe with a fenced yard. We hope to go back again in the Spring.

The location was perfect - close to Schreiner University, restaurants, and shopping. When I finished up my first day a littler earlier than expected, Mike was responsive and flexible in allowing my friend and I to check in a litter earlier. We were pleasantly surprised to find the apartment super clean, cozy, and with some snacks and drinks provided! On checkout day, we didn’t have to do any laundry or bedding/towel gathering - we just gathered our things and headed out. It was a perfect low-stress environment for two busy musicians. We will definitely keep this rental in mind for our next stay!"

This place offers everything that I need for my stay. Enjoyed a fabulous rain, lightning, and thunder show Sunday late at night. Just opened the door and looked up. Beautiful, private setting. Mike is very respectful of my space and time which I greatly appreciate. Always a pleasure to have conversations with Mike, catching up on all sorts of things in life. Mike is very generous and prepared. I like the location of this place since it is close enough, while far enough away from busy stuff. Love seeing the wildlife...the morning of my departure, I saw three deer in the back yard. I love that!! Thank you Mike for another wonderful stay!!"

Despite being in the military, my son isn’t quite old enough to independently rent an AirBNB (nor reserve a hotel room).
Mike was kind enough to let my Kiddo stay under my profile (with full disclosure ahead of time) and provided a clean, safe, comfortable stay.
This AirBNB’s location has beautiful surroundings, a close proximity to restaurants, free parking, plenty of towels, routine amenities, available WiFi, and prompt host communication.
Everything looked/operated as photographed.
I am grateful for the hospitality of the host and wish him and his family well. ☺️."

The snacks available are a bonus and shows the owner cares that you enjoy your visit. Everything was perfectly clean, which is the most important thing to me. Had a nice conversation with Mike, but he was not imposing at all. A really nice place for a great price. Thank you so much Mike!"

You might want to wait until after you check in before buying necessities because most necessities are already there. The apartment is very clean and inviting. The beds are comfy. No problem sleeping for me. You just need to bring yourself and your clothes. The bathroom and shower are also very spacious. Mike communicates all necessary information, and his communications are friendly but professional. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and I can agree that Miike is truly a super host. You won't regret your stay. I plan on staying again in the future. Thanks to Mike for putting so much thought, effort and comfort into his guests stays. Gilda D."

Stayed a few nights","I can think of any number of reasons why The Kinsleigh House would be just right for families needing a sweet spot in Kerrville, but thiswas our situation, perfectly accommodated by this cozy clean home away from home. Our son and DIL were about to have a baby at Peterson and we were to be in charge of their 3 yo son. He loves homey places so I got the feeling that a small house would be better than a hotel room where he could have his own room, have the run of the place, we could cook meals, visit the nearby public library, and get to new baby sister at Peterson in just minutes when called. It worked! After a comfy late nap in ""his room,"" it took just minutes to get big bro to the ""hopistable"". He said he liked ""our house"" but wanted to take the baby to his house. We received immediate responses for any questions we asked of our hosts and everything we needed was clean and at our disposal. This whole scenario but just couldn't have been any better than it was! Thank you so much"

Kerville is just much more relaxing and that was exactly what we were looking for.

Beds were so comfortable and had great feeling bedding. This is important while away from your own bed. A personal note and tray of snacks was a perfect touch and so sweet. Everytime I had a question, I was responded to promptly. The fireplace on the deck was so great to relax with, mornings and nights. Thank you for making us feel right at home for 3 days. We will be back. God bless."

As soon as we entered inside we felt beyond welcomed with the kind care package set out for us. It made the stay begin with smiles and complete happiness.

They were very friendly with smiles and waves, and also respectful of minimal contact. The view is phenomenal 😍. The kitchen was well stocked with appliances and dishes for my family and I. We were welcomed with an awesome snack basket!!! The beds were comfy. Bathroom super clean. The porch was exquisite, I loved the little fireplace outside! I only encountered one issue, not a huge deal just slightly inconvenient, the shower head pressure was not good at all, we had to use the “attachment head” during showers. Maybe it was user error 😅. My family loved it so much they begged me to stay one more day, which secretly I wanted to do as well =)"

Elena And Butch were very accommodating and easy to communicate with. All of our expectations were either met or exceeded. Definitely a great stay!"

Stayed a few nights","This place was awesome! The location was so close to town and activities. The home was squeaky clean and well planned for the small space. Cutely decorated. Outdoor porch now has patio furniture and propane fire as well as screens for the sunny afternoon. Sunset views were awesome. Due to the size I probably wouldn't recommend for over 2-3 people. While this maybe located on 19 acres, this home is not private. You enter through a gate surrounded by multiple trailers/homes being renovated. We could hear people nearby but they did not bother us. It is not practical to walk around. Parking for more than 2 cars would be challenging. The owner was super quick to answer questions and help us. The kitchen was pretty well stocked and we were even able to cook a pizza in the toaster oven. I would definitely return!"

The space was ultra clean and the views absolutely spectacular. Everything from bedding, towels, toiletries were high end.

Stayed with kids","My family and I spent a long weekend at Scenic Hills Getaway, and we enjoyed our stay so much! Initially, my daughter was annoyed with having to spend her 3-day weekend away from her friends, but as soon as she saw the welcome basket full of goodies and the loft with a spiral staircase—she was hooked! We were able to spend our time exploring the Texas Hill Country together during the day and reconnecting with each other around the fire pit at night. It was the relaxing getaway we needed after a heartbreaking September."

The place was bright cozy and clean. The deck overlooked a tree filled valley and with the gas fire pit watch beautiful sun sets. I thought this house with the amenities was well thought out. I would definitely do this again."

We had no issues so we didn’t test Elena & Butch’s responsiveness but they are there on the property so I’m sure it would have been great. Great experience and highly recommended!"

Stayed a few nights","This place is absolute perfection! It was spotlessly clean, tastefully decorated and so so comfortable.
The house itself is really neat and fresh. There is so much natural light (blinds on all the windows, though so no worry about early morning sun in your face,) and a stunning view. The deck is perfect for watching the sun set and taking in the natural beauty of the area.
The hosts were excellent with communication and were so nice and friendly. They gave us complete privacy, though so you can stay here and not talk to a single soul if that is your preference.
Quite literally my favorite Airbnb to date. I wouldn’t change a single thing. If we are ever back in the area we won’t even look for another place!"

Simple drive to explore Fredericksburg and some wineries and come back to enjoy a bottle of wine as you look at the sunset over the hills. Perfect weekend - I love this little gem of a place!

Butch and Elena were amazing hosts. Although I didn’t need anything while I was there (because they had already provided everything for us) I was confident that they would answer right away and either provide or point me in the right direction. The little house was located in its own little spot that felt very private. The sunset views were immaculate and the air conditioning worked great!! Overall everything was amazing and I will be staying again."

Stayed with kids","This place was so cozy and anything you could possibly need was available to use. We were so comfortable and the view was just so amazing, my little family and I ended up having a staycation. The great thing is, if you did want to do stuff or needed anything else, you are so close to town and there are really beautiful towns near by in the hill country like Fredericksburg. Everything was super clean, great quality in everything that was in the loft, and the beds and comforters were soooo comfortable. I think one of the reviews described the experience as melting into the bed. The Keurig was definitely a bonus, I drank so much coffee and tea. You can definitely see how much thought the hostess put into this location. It has privacy and you get a spectacular view of the hill country. I loved it so much, we'll probably plan another trip back here, whether to just relax or check out the surroundings."

All the little added touches that were there to make us more comfortable did not go unnoticed. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and especially liked the hummingbirds and cardinals that paid us a visit daily. This place is a great find and tucked away from everything.

Stayed a few nights","This little hidden gem was probably the best AirBnB that we've stayed at so far. Very quiet and peaceful location and the cabin was clean and modern. Just big enough to house all your needs from a small kitchen to a sofa and tv for relaxation. Elena and Butch are great at the small details and that is what makes the experience so special. They have snacks and a cute greeting card when you arrive and even provide a binder with important information that you may need such as great restaurants nearby, things to do and even emergency contact info. I was very impressed with their attention to details. I kept messaging her and they always responded which I appreciated. We even got to see deer grazing in front of our cabin which was beautiful to see. Plus small hummingbirds visited us one morning. The one issue we had was a small ant problem with our pastries but maybe that was our fault for leaving it out. The beds and shower were delicious. I loved that the shower was so spacious and you melted in the bed. The top bedroom is huge but not for tall people so just keep that in mind. Either way we would love to stay again as it really provided that private and safe space for relaxation. Thank you so much Elena and Butch. You have a wonderful little getaway space. Be blessed!"

The house was immaculately clean, with very comfortable beds, fluffy towels, and enough hot water that all five of us were able to shower, one after the other, after a day trip to the Gulf without it going cold. The view from the deck is just lovely, and so peaceful. Coffee and snacks were thoughtfully provided (and very much appreciated). Elena and Butch were kind, responsive, and welcoming hosts; we did have a small issue with red wasps having built a nest under the deck (a worry with our small kids), but when we messaged Elena and Butch about it they responded within minutes, and we were able to get the nest taken care of that very day. We've stayed in several lovely AirBnBs on family trips now, but this was by far our favorite experience."

There is a notebook providing helpful info for quests. We were also treated to fresh eggs from the chickens on the property upon arriving. The cabin is close to town as well as close to Fredericksburg and Comfort, both nice towns to visit. Sitting on the front porch having a cocktail in the evening watching the sunset was beautiful, as well as having coffee on the porch in the mornings. We had deer visit and several birds. It was a quiet and relaxing stay! If you are coming to Kerrville or The Hill Country area of Texas I would highly recommend staying in Elena and Butch’s Scenic Hills Getaway!"

I wanted a quiet and comfortable place with an amazing view and affordable price. Basically a diamond in the rough but Elena and Butch’s place was this and more! We loved all the thoughtful and comfortable amenities, from the snacks provided, the kitchen accessories which all came handy- especially the wine opener! - and super soft towels and cozy sheets and blankets. The propane fire pit was a highlight as we watched the sun set with wine in hand. I’m eager to come back again with more family (and friends) to showcase this gem of a place which has such fantastic hosts.

And the view is the best part - you can see it from every room. And the pics may not reflect that there's now a propane fire pit that warms the deck.

Stayed a few nights","We had a magical time staying at the bungalow! It was cozy and had everything we needed. The neighborhood around was enchanting- we explored “Wesley mountain” and discovered that our relatives came to camp there as children!
The one suggestion I would make is to bring a sleep mask as the natural light is strong in the mornings.
Thank y’all for the happy memories!"

The cleanliness, the rustic tone, the lighting, the windows everything about this place says just relax and unwind. I would 10/10 suggest for business trips, a relaxing night away from home or just passing through Kerrville. Thank you again Brian & Kristin for allowing me in your oasis."

All listed amenities were present, it was very clean and a super nice place to stay. We went to a restaurant they recommended and it was amazing. Overall an amazing experience.

I reached out saying I was bringing my vintage car and asked for some cardboard in case it leaked oil, and they immediately responded and accommodated me. The big question is “would I stay there again?” And the answer is a resounding “Yes!”."

Stayed a few nights","This is a one room (with a loft) cottage with a very Texas hill country feel. Tucked into a secluded hillside neighborhood of eclectic homes and cottages there are deer roaming the yards morning and evening. The cottage has a separate parking space that is easy to get into and back out of when you leave. The cottage is down a sloping walk/driveway with three stairs to the patio. Not accessible if you have mobility issues. The room is well lit with three sets of lights. The bed is very comfortable. The cottage is set up for two and that's all it can accommodate. It has a fully functional kitchen with everything you need to make your own meals, which we utilized. All the utilities worked well and cleaning supplies were adequate for washing dishes, pots, etc. There is a closet in the utility room for hanging clothes. Lots of extra pillows and blankets! The heating/cooling unit worked very well and kept the room toasty in the sub-freezing temperatures. Overall very satisfied."

Stayed with kids","We had a wonderful stay at Brian and Kristin’s place! Their friendly and welcoming messages were a wonderful priming for what was to be a very cheery stay for us. The space was such an enjoyable combination of coziness and light and volume, and the decoration and intentional touches were smart and friendly all along the way. The kitchen was well-equipped and pleasant,the laundry was an added help for us, and the bed was very comfortable. This is a wonderfully-stewarded place with incredibly hospitable hosts. If we get the chance to come to hill country again, we would hope to have a return stay here. High recommendations from us!"

It was a spacious loft-style place that was cutely decorated and had every amenity you might need. They even left water for me in the fridge! It was a 5-10 drive to anywhere in the town, so central but far enough away that it was peaceful and quiet."

Stayed with kids","Brian & Kristin's home is beautiful, cozy and airy with a lot of attention to detail - From the design/decor, the little thoughtful touches and the huge windows that welcomed the outdoors in. There was plenty to do inside from games, interesting books, watching movies, looking out for wildlife or just relaxing. However, our time was short and we wanted to explore the outdoors as it was our first time in Kerrville - We visited Enchanted Rock, Louis Hays Park, the Cross and a couple of restaurants. The first morning, we woke up to 4 deer in the yard. A lot of beauty to enjoy. We had no issues or questions however we could tell that our host were available, if needed. The communication ahead of our arrival was helpful, hospitable and reassuring that we would enjoy our stay - which we did! We were able to make some great memories. Thanks again for sharing your home! We hope to be back to make more memories there."

The kitchen was stocked with pots/pans/plates as well as had some condiments, tea bags, coffee/creamer, and water bottles. The bathroom was clean and had plenty of clean towels and the shower had shampoo, conditioner, and body soap ready to use which was super nice and convenient. The furniture is super comfy! I was working from “home” during my stay and let me say that sitting in those chairs for 8 hours was a dream! I wish I could work like that everyday. Overall I enjoyed my stay and it was nice to get out in the country and relax with some peace and quiet."

The AC is really (67 deg F) cold!! PAX coffee is a block and a half walking distance which we went to twice.
The HEB is 5 minutes away by car. We loved the quaint vibe of the house.
We came to spend time with my step mom, a 20 + yr Kerville resident and showed her the place, she dug it too!
This is a great place for a family with 2 kids or maybe for 2 couples.
Kali messaged us several times to make sure that things were going well."

Stayed a few nights","This house is nicely decorated inside and in a central, walkable area of Kerrville. We saw a deer on the property a couple times, and the home is located on a quiet street despite the fact it was close to Hwy 16. We did not utilize the backyard or game room, but I can imagine they would have been perfect for a family or friends to socialize together. It was a really hot weekend when we were there, but the air conditioning kept us cool and comfortable. Early risers will appreciate the back bedroom as it gets ample morning light. The beds were comfortable and the shower was great! Kali was friendly and hospitable. When I sent her a message on the way home letting her know we forgot a charging cord, she mailed it to us! We appreciated that extra level of care."

She asked me, prior to my arrival, my favorite food items & had it all there for me upon my arrival (blueberry muffins, fruit, diet cokes, bottle water, etc). TRULY appreciate that. She had EVERY amenity in her listing. One of the many things I noticed was ample toilet paper. That's so important! I never ran out of it. I really enjoyed the TV with all the cable channels inside my room. Prob my top favorite thing. The bed is very plush & comfortable. Linen is top quality. Light was on for me at night outdoors to help me see if I had to go outside, preventing me from falling since I have mobility challenges. One thing about me is that I am a private person, more of an introvert, as I age. I prefer little or no interaction. I was left alone, so thank you! I prefer communication thru airbnb app. I plan on staying at Jennifer's again. Thank you, Jennifer!😊"

Stayed a few nights","Jennifer and Marty are great host. Their Airbnb is facing a golf course which is beautifully landscaped. The Airbnb was a perfect place to stay for Margaret and I. Not too small or too spacious, just right. It is ideal for 1 or 2 people or a couple with small children. You have everything you need to heat and cook. A sizable refrigerator, bottled water, healthy teas, fruit, and rolls were provided for us. The bed was very comfortable. Our wish was that would have found it sooner than we did. The location is easy to find using GPS. Close to downtown."

Stayed a few nights","Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at Jennifer's place. It was quiet, clean, and a great place to retreat to after a busy day. Jennifer was great about communicating and went above and beyond, providing us with coffee and breakfast foods. Her husband also came to show us how to use the washer and dryer so that we could do laundry our last night. We appreciated having everything we needed in the kitchen to reheat food so we didn't have to eat out every night. We drove into Kerrville each day for a training and it only took us 8 minutes, which was nice.
The one negative, as many others have said in their reviews, is that you can hear them walking upstairs when they are above the bedroom and it is quite loud. If you are a light sleeper, ear plugs are definitely recommended! My husband had a hard time getting to sleep the first night because of the noise, so we went out and bought some.
If you are looking for a quiet getaway just outside of town, this is a great option!"

The room was clean and though we didn’t use the kitchen, it was ready to be used. Didn’t notice til the end that we had an entire bowl of fresh pineapple and an entire bowl of cantaloupe that we missed out on! Very hospitable. Hopefully will be back around the same time next year! 💕"

Beware it is someone's home upstairs, so there are loud footsteps throughout house. one night they came in at midnight and woke us up. we came during nights, so the front door did not have a light for key pad. The keypad needs a glow or light to open door smoothly. There was not a private door to sit outside. you have to go through two doors to sitting area."

Stayed a few nights","Where we stayed at Jennifer's was one of several she rents out. We were on a ground level with a private entrance, bath & nicely stocked small kitchen. The room was spacious with a desk and a place to hang clothing and a table to sit at. The bathroom was a small, but adequate with sink, toilet and shower and private only to us.
She made check in simple by asking us what code we would like to have to open the door; great idea! She left us fresh cut fruit and also asked what our preference on drinks would be, which is a great idea. We had a personal request of her while there, and she was very responsive to answer us on that.
The reason we cannot give her 5 stars is the fact that someone was above us and we could hear them moving around when we tried to turn in for the evenings; super annoying. We could not hear music or TV's or voices, but definitely could hear people moving and it was loud; right above where we were trying to sleep. We could not recommend based on this issue."

Jennifer had it all, even the teas that I drink and gluten free muffins. Such a treat. And a blender to make smoothies was a bonus.
I appreciated all the clean linens and the opportunity to meet housekeeping and others. such great people.
The book with things to do and places to eat was great I used that.
The deck is nice overlooking the golf course.
I would without a doubt reccomend Jennifer's place... and I look forward to staying there again in the future.
Thanks again Jennifer for this peaceful abode I stayed in."

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed out two night stay in this lovely and cozy location. Bedroom, bathroom, kitchen and patio are exactly as what you see in the pictures. Once you enter you feel the welcome and coziness of the quaint kitchenette. Ms. Jennifer went out of her way to have muffins and and large bowl of freshly cut fruit chilling in the refrigerator. The housekeeper came by to ensure all was well and to our liking. The evening was quite cold and Ms. Jennifer immediately adjusted the thermostat as soon as she received our message. She was so kind and even brought a blanket to us to ensure our comfort. We had a wonderful, comfortable and restful stay here and paid much less than staying at a local hotel. If you are in the area and are searching for a clean, comfortable and convenient place to stay: look no further. Stay here at Ms. Jennifer's; you will not regret it. We plan to come and stay again when our family is here in the area."

The place is clean and home-y and definitely worth the price. Jennifer is very responsive. The room is directly underneath the hosts house, so for light sleepers it would be good to bring earplugs since the footfalls echo in the Airbnb. This is my third time staying at one of Jennifer’s places and it is great!"

also to add, the smart tv, fast wifi and fully stocked bathroom with all of the hair products you could need during a visit was a PERFECT additive! i didn’t even think to bring shampoo and conditioner and realized as i was unpacking i had forgotten it, but jennifer had the bathroom stocked with all of that. the location felt extremely safe and was quiet. we will definitely be returning to stay at this place when we’re back in kerrville!"

Stayed a few nights","The host, room itself, location, and amenities were all great and as described. They provided breakfast muffins, coffee, soap and shampoo, and check in was easy! The place was clean and orderly. The reason for the three stars is around the indication of “entire house”. I believe that is a bit misleading. This is an extension on the bottom floor of what seems to be the owners current residence that included a private kitchen and bathroom. While the entrance, exit, and stay were private, the walls were thin enough that it still had the feeling of just being a room in the house. If you are looking for a quiet, private place for a weekend getaway then this might not be the choice. If you want a place right on the golf course and don’t mind the interaction then this is perfect."

A delightful breakfast and delicious coffee was provided. Each morning, we were greeted by a family of four deer in the safe and quiet neighborhood. The host was available at all times to answer questions. We value the hospitality and generosity of the host. The big bonus: we were able to watch the world series on the large TV! Having traveled extensively and stayed in a variety of quality accommodations, we rate this great little hideaway in the hills as one of the best in the world."

Stayed a few nights","I was very impressed with the property and with my hosts. The communication was excellent before and during my visit. They were warm and welcoming when I arrived, with clear explanations about the room and the house. Jenn provided well-thought out recommendations on local attractions and activities.

The room is accessed from the first floor through the main door. It felt very private, secluded and serene. The room is very spacious, very clean, and tastefully decorated. There was fruit and bottled water in the room, which I thought was lovely touch - well beyond what I had expected. Also stocked with hair care products and body lotions to try. The bed was very comfortable - I slept very soundly. The spacious driveway near the room, so parking and unloading my car was easy.

I enjoyed coffee on the deck and chatting with Jenn and her husband in the mornings. They were friendly without being intrusive. The views from the deck were pretty amazing. I watched a herd of deer grazing on the golf course, while sipping my coffee and checking my email. It is on the bottom floor with rooms over, so I did hear footsteps in the morning, but was not bothersome (I am a very light sleeper, but it didn't wake me). I am already planning my next visit!"

We didn’t utilize all the benefits such as the pools and the river and canoes but stayed for four days as a base for visits to state parks and small towns in the area. Perfect on all levels.

Ample blankets, pillows, and towels. Shower was warm with good water pressure. There was a cute and yummy bakery two doors down, and a cafe with vine covered patio just beyond the bakery. We were greeted by the tamest deer I've ever seen morning and night. Melissa made the place easy to find and access and check out was seamless. We will stay here again when we visit Kerrville."

Stayed with kids","It was an unlocked rental. It was night time and in a retail area with a business parking lot. I did not know if there was someone in the house, so I had to check it out before bringing my small children inside. The door only locks with the key, and there's no deadbolt, so anyone else with that key could have entered. I ended up sleeping on the couch for safety. There's also a kitchen door to a back alley with glass. I needed to use the restroom in a hurry, one door was missing to the toilet and the other door to the shower area I shut behind me. As I was using the restroom, the door swung back open and the windows had no blinds and curtains in bedroom were open so anyone in the parking lot could see me. That door only stays shut if locked from the inside-not childproof. I could not find an outlet in bathroom to get ready. Restaurant doesn't serve breakfast, which was why I chose to stay there for room service. Breakable stuff at knee height & on every surface so I had to move it up."

The owners were very responsive any time we communicated, the place was clean and was as described. There was an AC mishap the day we arrived and Melissa, her husband and staff got right on it! Things cooled down and while we waited, we were treated to dinner and drinks at Rails! Our server, Kai was very helpful and friendly with local recommendations. The location is in a very walkable area. We went to Pint and Plow for dinner and for coffee the next morning. The Louise Hays park and trail system is within walking/jogging distance and is worth checking out. For families, there are two playgrounds for them to get some energy out. My toddler enjoyed the kid friendly toys that were available at Sleepy side as well."

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I really enjoyed our stay at The Sleepy Side of Rails. The historic structure was nicely renovated. I particularly liked the restored hard pine floors, as well as the original moldings and windows. There were enough modern conveniences to make it comfy and cozy.
Our first few nights were wonderful. On our last night, in the middle of a Central Texas heat wave, the air conditioning went out. Our host, Melissa, went above and beyond to insure our comfort that night and booked us a hotel room nearby. A true super host.
We would definitely stay again when we return to Kerrville."

Highly recommend a reservation only because the evening stacks up pretty quickly. This is a popular place for out of towners and locals.

Yummy pastry and dessert along with impulse sweets for later or gifts."

One downside, the TV is Roku TV, streaming only. All-in-all, one of the better AirBnB rentals I have experienced."

Bed was comfortable, liked the chairs out front, and the closeness to the Rails Cafe. Could walk to the Pints & Plow brewery, good gluten free pizza!"

I wanted to bless and honor my precious wife of 36 years with a comfortable, restful and peaceful stay in the beautiful hill country around Kerville and being Melissa's guests at this wonderful Airbnb was just perfect! You are sure to experience Melissa's care for her customers through the attention to detail in decorating and furnishing the home in such a way that you feel immediately welcomed and comfortable. It is centrally located and near many good restaurants. We enjoyed peace and quiet that resulted in a great night's sleep. Our only disappointment is that we could not stay longer! God bless you Melissa for your care and kindness!!!"
