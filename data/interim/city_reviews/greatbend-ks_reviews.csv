They have a brita filter pitcher which is what we use at home so that was fantastic. We appreciated having access to Prime Video so we could have our weekly “movie night”. The beds were comfortable and the overall atmosphere was great. We would stay there again.

Easy to find and even though there was a blizzard warning our first night, we were warm and cozy and enjoyed a movie night together at the house. Would definitely consider coming back next time we're in the area!"

The Ranch House is located in a nice clean residential area that is family oriented. Super close to the grocery store, Walmart, fast food, and many other businesses. Everything inside is new ( flooring, paint, furniture, appliances, nice comfortable bedding, etc - FYI thermostat fancy & different but a manual on how to operate will be in your information after booking your stay) A/C works well, good water pressure with plenty of hot water, and fenced backyard with covered patio slab. They also have a high chair & playpen if you have littles. Dumpster located in front next to driveway.
We spent 5 nights - you can obviously see these guys have worked their hiny’s off with remodeling and it looks wonderful. Updated, clean & tidy. Everything Rick described in his listing is accurate."

While we were there the pilot light went out on the water heater. I mention this not as a complaint because things like this just happen sometimes. I mention it as a compliment to Rick's professional response. It was handled quickly and efficiently. Not only did he have it relit quickly, he even sent someone over later to double-check the water heater.

Brent was always polite and responsive to my questions and his instructions for getting there were perfect. Even while driving in near whiteout conditions (Kansas was in a bit of a blizzard mode), I found my way there.

Brent was great about answering a question I had, and I felt no hesitation about reaching out if I had more questions.
If I had been staying longer, I might've asked about the tiny laundromat next door. Seems like a great service in a good location.

Super clean entirely. 2 burner cooktop, full size fridge, etc. makes it great to run up to the local market (7 minutes), meet more wonderful locals, pick up stuff for dinners, breakfast, etc. They have a Keurig and bold coffee on hand. If you want foo foo flavors, you'd better bring them.

The location is close to the highway while still being peaceful and quiet. The gas station takes tap to Pay, and the beds are the most comfortable I've slept in for a while.
Already got this place saved for my next road trip."

Stayed with a pet","this is truly a gem in a very small friendly town. we immensely enjoyed our brief stay while driving through Kansas. the tiny house felt more than enough room for my big adult son, myself and my medium sized dog (who loved it there with the huge open grassy field to romp in..
it also looks out (from all the well placed big windows) on in a very quiet, sweet street in a tiny neighborhood right off the main drag.
we had a great, warm, friendly meal at the local pub 2 minutes away then watched netflix and then retired to our separate private “rooms” for best road trip sleeps. the beds are huge and very comfortable! every detail we could’ve thought of was covered and cozy and Brent was super friendly, responsive and accommodating. will definitely stay here again!"

Stayed with a pet","This place was the perfect pit stop and the backstory of how Brent engages the youth in town to innovate while providing an outlet for building skills is next level type of helping the community. His students have helped design and build the units and it makes it that much more special. I hope to see more of people like Brent and his family in the world - would love to support this type of business. I’m going to spread the word!!
As far as the stay, the bedroom window was my favorite part of my stay. You wake up to this field and it felt so cozy. The beds were comfortable with fans to help create white noise and perfect if it got warm. There was all the immensities I could need and the shower was incredibly warm for the cold winter night I stayed there. I brought my black lab who tracked in dirt and there was a Dyson that I could conveniently use (not sure if it was left there intentionally) but it came in very handy.
Would 10/10 recommend for a tiny home stay!!"

Stayed one night","Great place for an overnight stay. Everything you need for comfort. The tiny house was unique and fun. There were two of us, but it could easily accommodate up to six. Had some trouble opening the door and Brent immediately responded with the answer. The price at around $70 can’t be beat. The only issue is that the place is about 30 miles south of Hayes K S off interstate 70, so it’s a little out of the way, but the price and convenience certainly offset the location. The home is in a very small town, but we didn’t stay for any length just overnight on our way to Colorado Springs. Would highly recommend"

Our dogs enjoyed all the space outside to run around before getting back on the road the next day. Highly recommend Brents tiny home if you happen to be traveling through rural Kansas."

Stayed a few nights",Terri’s stay was exactly what we were looking for for our girl’s weekend stay! We felt right at home immediately & the home had thoughtful touches for snacks & if you have fur babies. She was communicative with us as needed & even allowed us to check in a little early based on our arrival. Will absolutely stay at her place again if in the area & recommend it to anyone looking for a cozy place to stay!

I'm totally solid on and plan to try to get it every time we have someone in.
Thank You Terri!"

Comfortable beds, comfortable furniture, large television with all sorts of channels. Beautiful kitchen with all you could need. All around an excellent place to stay and one of the best I've stayed in. I would love to stay here again if passing through the area. Congratulations to the owners!"

The kitchen is very large and has all you'd need to host a big meal, or just gather for takeout. Linens were clean and beds comfortable. Plenty of room to spread out and stretch after a long day in the car. Tons of small touches and thoughtful additions make this a great stay. Terri was friendly and responsive in her communication. I'd definitely stay again if in the area!"

Stayed a few nights","The location was good and the dogs were cute, but this was more like staying at your single guy friend’s apartment than at a typical AirBnB. There was no top sheet on the bed, the shower was missing half its rings, there was no trash bin in the bathroom, and it was not clean. The sheets appeared to be clean, but very little else was – the shower was dirty and had hair in it, the coffee pot and mugs were dirty, the bedskirt had pieces of dried mud and debris stuck to it, etc.
Additionally, the thermostat was set at 69 when we arrived, but it was cold. We ended up sleeping in our coats and hats the first night because the room never heated up, despite waking up several times to turn up the thermostat. The next day we realized we had to set the thermostat to 85 to get the heat up to 68, which was still cold but tolerable."

Our plan was to wash laundry and check-in on work emails and unfortunately neither of these goals was possible here (no washer/dryer access, one bar wifi that just couldn't get us connected). The ""welcome brigade"" of kittens, cats, and dogs was sweet and all the animals were very friendly. Expect barking dogs through the night though, as these are working farm animals and they were guarding against something from roughly midnight until 3 am."

Stayed one night","The guest house was pretty dirty. It had spiders crawling around. One even got on the bed. I realize this is way out in the country so that is to be expected some. There was a soiled cloth in the shower and the coffee pot had mold inside where the coffee grounds had not been emptied in a very long time.
The animals were friendly and check-in was very easy. There is a keypad on the side door.
There were many, many cats around the place, so if a visitor does not like cats or may be allergic, this may not be the place to stay. Overall, there were some good and bad things to say about it. We never met the hosts, which was just fine, we only slept there and ate breakfast.
We appreciate the stay and good night's sleep."

We felt right at home and enjoyed our time talking with Melissa. The location is perfect for visiting the nearby wildlife refuges, or for just unplugging. Would be a great place to stay for a week. We will definitely make a point to stay at their place on our future trips across Kansas."

The rental is a private building beside the main house that contains everything you need for a comfortable stay, including a kitchen and spacious living area. I did not meet the human hosts in person, but their dogs and cats were friendly and welcoming. Aaron and Melissa were communicative and provided helpful local tips for food and things to do. I enjoyed the fried chicken at Bookies and the coffee at pePerks (and the blueberry pie). The location is excellent for visiting the beautiful Cheyenne Bottoms waterfowl refuge, which contains numerous animals, including turtles and pelicans. I wish I could have stayed longer."

The Airbnb is adjacent to the main living house, which affords perfect privacy but also comfort in knowing people are around. You can have as much or as little interaction with the host as you want. The sunrises and sunsets over the vast farmlands were incredible. The living space was cozy and warm.
Of fun note, Kansas Badlands are about a two hour drive west of the Airbnb near Scott City. Absolutely worth the drive to explore this hidden treasure."

Stayed one night","Aaron & Melissa were great and there place is lovely. It is a small efficiency apartment in a freestanding house. It has a full kitchen warm cozy beds, and a sitting area. The entire place is spotlessly clean. The best part almost, are the animals. Three of the coolest dogs EVER, and lost of beautiful affectionate kitties to play with. It was absolutely heavenly.
One thing to note, (and i did not pay attention when reading their description, so entirely my fault), is, there is no Internet. That was a small problem for us, as we were planing itinerary day, by day, but we managed. If you can live without Internet for a night or two, (or hopefully longer) you will not find a more perfect place to relax. I highly recommend. Would stay there again."

Group trip","This home is clearly remodeled, and they did a great job updating it. The decor is simple and clean, very cute. The Kitchen has everything you would need and new appliances. The coffee station was even equipped with coffee, creamer, sugar, breakfast bars and oatmeal, so you don’t have to stop at the store in your way into town. They were thoughtful to add extra mirrors in bedrooms, making it easier for multiple people to get ready with only two bathrooms. It was perfect for our family of 5 adults.
The neighborhood has mature landscaping and typical Great Bend homes around. The only downside was barking/howling dogs one night, but the owner obviously can’t help that. The other thing to know (if you have mobility issues) is that there are stairs immediately inside the door, but only a few steps up to the main floor.
Easy checkin and responsive host if you have any questions before or during the stay. Thanks for an easy place to stay while visiting family in town!"

Only complaint, there was no shampoo or soap for the shower just hand soap at the sinks. Had to go purchase our own even though the listing stated it was included. Other than the soap issue everything else was great and would stay here again."

We had everything we needed and were very comfortable! Slept well on the memory foam mattress, and the fenced in backyard was very appreciated by our dog after a long day traveling. Only downside, which wasn't the host's fault, was the neighbors dog who barked off and on most of the night. It didn't keep us from sleeping but was a little annoying when we were awake! Overall, we will definitely stay here again when we travel between KY and CO!"

Stayed with a pet","Adorable little cottage! We loved it.
Pros:
- Adorable
- Fenced in yard let our dog play. She chose to stand still and hope a squirrel came and jumped into her mouth.
- LOVED, loved all the little extras! From the bath salts (two of us took advantage), to the drinks and snacks (the two bottomless pits, I mean, TEENAGERS, took advantage), everything was very well thought out
Cons, all minor:
- the address is on 17th, but it’s actually in the alley behind (neighbor directed us).
- pull out sofa seemed fairly new, but like all pull outs, it wasn’t the most comfortable. Luckily, we planned for this and brought an inflatable open cell memory foam 3” camping mattress. Problem solved. Would probably be fine for younger kids though."

Stayed with kids","Super cute, very clean little hide-a-way/cottage, comfy bed and pullout sofa worked well. Cold water in the fridge was a nice treat. Used this location for a break on the way back to KC with my son -worked out great. It was very quiet while sleeping. The shower head was fabulous and there's central air and internet. We did not cook as our stay was super short but cutest kitchen. Terri is excellent at responding. Off street parking and can park right by the door. This location sits behind a house and you enter through the alley which makes it great to ' hide out' and relax."

This place looks like it came straight out of a HGTV remodel; so cute and well thought out.
We look forward to the next time we can come back and stay in this cute little cottage.

The location is off the busy streets and so quiet and safe. Finn had a small fenced in back yard to do his business. The space was very comfortable for us and if I could magically reproduce Terri’s AirBNB in every place we travel I would! Our dog is so much more at ease in a rental home than a motel. This house was very affordable and met all of our needs to feel at home.

The house is fully equipped for cooking and the little backyard was a favorite too. Perfect for out two pups to run around in and if we wanted to we could have used the grill! They thought about everything in this little home. You will not be disappointed. You won’t want to leave. Lol

Soaps, toothbrushes, pots and pans, cleaning supplies, even small things like can openers, face wipes, and q tips. The Airbnb is designed beautifully and is very cozy and clean. It came with Netflix, fast internet, and a Roku TV. There is a small fenced in back yard which was perfect for our dog. The yard was also always trimmed and kept tidy. The neighborhood is very nice and easily walkable. There is a veterans park with a playground, lake, and dog park about a ten minute walk from the Airbnb. Restaurants and Walmart are also about a two minute drive away. The location was very quiet with plenty of privacy from neighbors. This place was perfect for our long-term stay and the rates were very reasonable. Oh and the AC worked incredibly! We almost never had to use it because it would cool the house so fast. Our hosts were also very responsive and answered our questions very quickly whenever we had questions. We highly recommend this Airbnb and are grateful for our hosts providing such a great stay in Great Bend. 🙂"

We also had perfect weather and sat outside on the porch.

Stayed with kids","We stayed with Alonzo because we wanted a retreat atmosphere in the country where we could have some quality time with the extended family. His place fit the bill perfectly! Alonzo was wonderful; very friendly (stopped by and visited with us one evening after he had a very busy day...), very responsive. If you're looking for a quiet country get-away at the Great Bend of the Arkansas River, take a look at this place. We'll certainly go back!"

Stayed with a pet","Everything was great and the rooms were spacious. Would return in a heartbeat. My family needed this and it delivered. The stress just melted away. Fun too! Walks, wildlife, nice, distant neighbor and luckily cool temperatures. Will never stay in a hotel again when I visit family and friends."

Stayed with kids","Alonzo was a fabulous host! Really great guy and his Lodge is the absolute perfect spot for a family getaway. Our family had a blast! There is so much room for a big group to get to spread out and enjoy the land.
The patio is one of the best parts with lots of comfortable seating including swings and beautiful lighting around that gives a peaceful and fun vibe at night. Great place to kick it! There is also a fir pit perfect for making s’mores!
Our 2nd fav part was the big garage in the back that is basically the rec room. There is corn hole, darts, mini basketball with a big screen TV and comfortable seating for your family to have some fun.
The kitchen is perfect for preparing big meals for a group of people! It comes equipped with any and everything you need!
Bedrooms and bathrooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. Also something I appreciate is there are portable fans in every room and even a pack and play for a baby if need be! Can’t say enough! Thank you Alanzo!"
