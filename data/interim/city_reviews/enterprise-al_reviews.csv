Stayed with kids","Hosts are very responsive however the parking is super tight for stay. The neighborhood and parking lot is very questionable. The lights in bedroom were very dim hard to see for makeup, eye contacts, or even locating jewelry. Had to use cell phone flashlight to see. The shower head was eh- water control was hard to keep normal either burning hot or to cold. Very small bathroom
There was a cat urine smell inside through out rooms along cheap cleaner smell inside kitchen. The instructions for AC was very unbearable and not comfortable at 70 in Alabama. My son developed a cough and asthma attack on our stay due to temp that was “allowed” and cat urine smell in house. Lots of dust bunnies in master room under dresser. We couldn’t wait to get out. Nice decor but wouldn’t recommend"

There were commodities available from hygiene to cooking to cleaning. She made sure check in went smoothly and that there were no issues during our stay. If I ever am back in the area- Sylvia will be my choice- not to mention she has more than one listing available so that makes it’s even better. If you’re looking for a great experience- she is the one.

When I look at a place, one of the first things I take notice of is if the bathrooms are clean….never once did I have to clean the bathrooms or anything else prior to using.
I ask a question or two through the Airbnb app and received a response almost instantly.

Well done, Sylvia! I would stay again!

Everything you needed was already in the airbnb to accommodate you with your stay.. It’s very quiet you could literally walk out and hear a pen drop. Whenever, I visit again I will most definitely be booking with her again. We have no regrets an we were very pleased with our stay. We drove 6hrs from Memphis ,Tn for my sister’s baby shower. We loved everything. It felt so cozy, peaceful and we were able to relax with no worries.

The unit was freshly updated had everything we needed to make it a comfortable stay. We appreciated the map of where people had come from to stay here, as well as the guest register for a special touch.
We can't wait to stay here again in about a month when our first grandchild arrives! We can't praise her enough (-:"

---
I had the most wonderful stay at Sylvia's Airbnb! From the moment I arrived, I felt welcomed and at home. Sylvia is not just a host; she's a true gem who goes above and beyond to ensure her guests have a fantastic experience.
The accommodations were immaculate, and the attention to detail was remarkable. The cozy bedroom, well-equipped kitchen, and charming living space made my stay incredibly comfortable. Sylvia's home is a true oasis of comfort and relaxation.
What truly sets this Airbnb apart is Sylvia herself. She's not just a host; she's a warm and caring person who genuinely cares about her guests.
I can't thank Sylvia enough for her hospitality and kindness. This Airbnb experience exceeded all my expectations, and I can't wait to return!"

Stayed a few nights","I have become a regular at Sylvia's listings. She's always very polite and quick to respond. I wanted until the last minute to book for the 4th and had to book 2 of her properties. They ended up being next door to each other. Instead of me having to leave and come back, she accommodated me by cleaning the second property first and allowed me to stay at the first property until cleaning was complete. The second night's stay at this property did come with a small problem with ants in the bedroom, which made me have to sleep in the other bedroom with smaller beds. It's the south and we've had a LOT of rain. Even if you think your house is air tight, they somehow still sometimes find a way in. Sylvia was quick to respond and even refunded me for the incident. I will continue to be a regular."

Places that allow dogs can sometimes not be as clean or have a smell or minor damages here and there, but this was not the case at all. The fenced in backyard is perfect for your fur baby to go outside with ease and safety. It was also SUCH a pleasure for my husband to return to the Fort Rucker area where he attended flight instructor school. Our stay exceeded our expectations while traveling from out of state to attend our daughter’s college graduation! This amazing home made our family visit that much more positive and comfortable!

The only thing I would recommend changing is the living room furniture. It’s pretty but really isn’t comfortable for hanging out in there with the family! Thanks again for opening your home to us! We enjoyed ourselves. Nice touch with providing board games. The grandkids loved them!

Stayed with a pet","Overall the experience was okay, but I was not impressed with the communication.
There was evidence that large dogs have been there and the home and the floors should be professionally cleaned.
I asked about having the lawn mowed and was informed it would be the following day but it did not occur for the remainder of our stay (5 more days).
During my stay , I repaired their vacuum (brushroll was inoperable and full of string/hair), replenished their clorox wipes, coffee, bleach, etc but when my kids broke two wine glasses by accident I was asked to pay for them and I did so immediately. A week later I was questioned when I would pay for them and I had to show that I had paid them a week prior. I could be in the wrong, but it bothered me that they asked me to pay for them to begin with considering the things I did and bought out of common courtesy.
I would still stay here again and this home is still much cleaner and nicer than the majority in the area."

The kitchen had everything plus a few extras (coffee, tea, hot cocoa, oatmeal, etc.) The only thing I wish that the home had was tvs in the smaller bedrooms and table to sit outside in the backyard. Other than that, it was a great experience and beautiful home. If I ever visit Alabama again, this home or their other properties will be my first choice if available."

I only slept on the master bedroom bed and I can confirm that it was so comfortable. I slept like a baby. The kitchen had lots of counter space which was awesome. Everything about this place was great. Anytime we had a question April and Randy responded immediately. I can't say enough nice things. You can't go wrong here. We will be back for sure.

Stayed with a pet","Ivan communicated with me prior to, and after our stay. During our stay, I had a problem unlocking the front door (completely my error) and he was quick to respond. The house was exactly as described. It was a nice pet-friendly and child-friendly house (although we didn't have any children with us). The house was immaculate! We enjoyed sitting on the screened-in back porch in the mornings listening to the Cardinals while drinking our coffee. The tv was easy to operate. The showers were nice with great pressure in the hall bathroom. I was extremely pleased with the house and if needed, would stay there again. I would highly recommend this Airbnb!"

It was wonderful sitting on the enclosed porch & watching the kiddo play. Close to stores & downtown. We would most definitely stay again. We felt so relaxed. The only thing I would add is a curtain on the front door. Even though it had beveled glass, headlights still shone through and one of the guests were sleeping in that area. The option have covering at night over that door would be wonderful. Thank you Ivan for a great experience! ~ The Hall Family"

Stayed a few nights","This is a great find! The host was superb and his quick responses and information throughout our stay. We arrived after dark but the entryway and front door was very well lit which made our entrance to the house very easy and safe. The whole property had only small steps at the thresholds which was great for my octogenarian parents with limited mobility. We had access to the double door garage which was very nice and rare. We were happy to be able to park in the garage for added security. Also, the hosts have a treadmill and weight bench in the garage which was nice as an option for those dedicated to working out or walking/running even on rainy days. The house and furnishings were immaculate and tasteful. The home has a supply of games and activities for kids and families. The neighborhood was very walkable and clean. If we’re back in the area, we will definitely stay here again! It was an ideal home away from home."

The home itself is beautifully decorated and has a cozy, inviting atmosphere. You'll feel right at home from the moment you step inside. The screened in porch was lovely and inviting. A great place to relax at the end of the day. The beds were comfortable and the home was well stocked with all of the essentials. I especially appreciated the full size hair dryer!
From the moment I made my booking, the host was quick to respond to my messages and answer any questions. Throughout my stay, the host remained accessible and responsive. This level of attentiveness made my stay all the more comfortable and stress-free.
Overall, this Airbnb is an excellent choice for anyone visiting Fort Rucker or the Enterprise area. With its prime location, cozy atmosphere, and high-tech amenities, it truly feels like a home away from home."

From the moment we walked in, we were amazed at how clean it was and how many extra touches there were throughout. They had everything we needed to feel right at home. The kitchen was very well stocked, including a wonderful coffee bar and our kids’ favorite - a waffle maker! We enjoyed our morning coffee and meals on the beautiful screened patio. There was plenty of room for all 7 of us to sit comfortably and watch a movie together.
Ivan is super responsive and so nice to work with! He even helped me out when I made a mistake on our reservation, which was so appreciated! We highly recommend this house and definitely hope to stay here again when we visit our son."

Refrigerator was super clean and had an ice maker which is always a plus. We enjoyed our meals on the screened in porch and the gas grill was super nice and new. The beds were super comfortable and the bedding was oh so soft and inviting. There was workout equipment in the garage if you desire to keep fit during your stay. Also plenty of boxed games to entertain yourself with in the evenings and some toys for the youngsters. We had no issues whatsoever and communication with Ivan was great.

Rather you are traveling for work or visiting the area in general, it’s nice to have your own space that’s fully stocked of all the typical things you need. Has stuff for kids and babies as well. It’s in a very friendly safe neighborhood. As well as garage parking for added security. The host was immediate to respond. The house was clean and inviting. Huge backyard for kids to play. Or to hang out. I would recommend if you are in the area and especially if you need more than 2 bedrooms."

Group trip","This property was without a doubt the best experience we have ever had with a short term rental! I wish I could give them 6, maybe 7 stars. The owner communicated incredibly well, was extremely helpful, and obviously knows what they're doing when it comes to an Airbnb. The property had so many extra amenities, they thought of everything you could want. It was impeccably clean and well maintained. I've never seen an Airbnb look so much like a magazine cover, yet still make you feel at home the second you enter it. We absolutely loved the property and the support from the owner. 10/10 would rent again and recommend to anyone who needs a great place to stay in Enterprise!! Thanks Ivan, for being an amazing host and for sharing your home with us. Best wishes!! 🙏🫡"

Our tween and teen girls fell in love with how soft and incredibly comfortable the bunkbeds were. They were sad to leave the beds behind! We found our beds to be just as comfortable and ideal! The kitchen was very well stocked which we greatly appreciated. And Ivan and his team did an incredible job getting us a grill to use on short notice. We were blown away by their thoughtfulness!! I should also mention all 6 of our tweens and teens enjoyed the foosball table and electronic game board. They were both big hits! The backyard was also a fantastic space to throw our football and frisbee around. The kids also appreciated that they didn’t get any mosquito bites while in the backyard. It was a fantastic stay! Thank you for sharing your incredible place with us!

Both properties have been exactly as described, with all listed amenities. We felt immediately at home at both properties, and it truly a great value for all the space and privacy you get.
Kitchen has plenty of room to cook if need be, and the thoughtful teapot and Kerig definitely got some use.

We were there for a pageant that kept us from sun up to sun down, we opted for the air bnb because it gave our daughter a break from the pageant she wouldn't of had If we'd of stayed at the host hotel. So it was perfect for our needs and is about 15 minutes from the Enterprise Civic Center."

I suspect that there are a lot of military due to the close proximity to base, which is most likely the reason for the congestion. I really enjoyed the stay. Loved having access to the garage remote! My last place didn't have one and I had to keep getting in and out of the car in the cold. The place was extremely clean, plenty of space. Sylvia is very responsive, and does so in a timely manner. I definitely recommend and look forward to booking again."

Stayed a few nights","What an outstanding townhouse and location. Several things all played into the 5 star rating. First the townhouse: it was clean, tidy, well appointed and everything was as promised. Two very large bedrooms and large actually doesn’t describe their size well enough. A small but well stocked kitchen and dining table was perfect for breakfasts at the house. We were fortunate to have access to the garage and that was such a plus. Second the communication: absolutely outstanding. Not just timely communications but everything was followed up with another note. A question we had was replied to within 30 minutes. We really felt that anything we needed would be accommodated if possible. Third is location: if you are there to access Fort Rucker you are less than 5 minutes to one of the gates. We were there for our son’s graduation from flight school and this was PERFECT. Plus we were closer to downtown Enterprise which was nice since it’s such a quaint town. We HIGHLY recommend Sylvia’s AirBNB!"

Stayed a few nights","We travel a lot, and I've entered many Airbnb. I long to be able to enter then relax. Unfortunately, because of my work in the construction industry, my eye for detail and workmanship keeps me from just being. I tend to see everything(bad). I'm sure its mental. Entering this home gave me a unique opportunity to both relax and respect great workmanship. Everything from the rustic log cabin interior to the floor elevation change in the kitchen just so a set of stairs wouldn't look out of place reaching the second-floor kid's loft. Trimming every nook and softening every angle. Knock down ceilings with a flawless 45-degree corner bead. Little lanterns hardwired for accent lighting. Ductless splits installed level and tight to the wall. As one old timer told me years ago. ""If you have no pride in what you're doing, you'll have no shame in doing it poorly."". This home is unique in that way, (forgiving the tile, lol) and it was a pleasure to stay in. Quiet, cozy and relaxing. Thanks again!."

And provided us with a pack n play for the baby! When we walked in we were all pleasantly surprised to see how nice the apartment was! My kids absolutely loved the bedroom space and were so excited about the way it was set up. The pictures don’t do it justice, it looks so much nicer than what you see in the photos. Larry is also a very courteous host and made sure that we were okay with activities he would be doing before doing them. I definitely recommend choosing him for your stay and we absolutely loved the clubhouse!"

Stayed one night","‘The Clubhouse’ – An Absolute Must See!
I have had the good fortune of staying at all 3 of Larry’s properties, which are uniquely beautiful in their own way. BUT, I must say that this is, by far, the most well-thought-out and creatively designed rental property that I have ever stayed at. Not only is it aesthetically pleasing with its woodworking style, creativity, design and layout, it is also fully functional / equipped, modern, elegant, comfortable and clearly focuses on the needs of the Guests, by providing a much appreciated attention to detail, in order to ensure all the comforts of home, and then some.
The carpentry, rustic, yet comfortable, furniture and décor, coupled with the modern and elegantly styled kitchen, with all the amenities and appliances (small and large), make it an ideal accommodation, which can be appreciated by both men, women and children alike.
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND staying at The Clubhouse, for both short and long-term stays. You’ll be glad you did."

We found that in spades with Larry's rental. From the moment we walked in, we were struck by the excellent craftsmanship and attention to detail that he put into creating it. The woodworking, lighting, and decorations were amazing, and all weekend long, we were finding new ""little surprises"" to marvel at. The place was extremely well-appointed, and it was super convenient for everything that we did. The setting that it is in is wonderful as well. A quiet and beautiful country surrounding as viewed from the porch, was the perfect setting to start my day with a cup of coffee, and the tv with surround sound in the living area was the perfect place to finish it. We came away highly impressed and happy with our time spent here"

Incredible workmanship in the wood, thoughtful touches in the kitchen and bathroom, and even electric lanterns throughout the unit that can be dimmed. Also has a/c units in each room, including the loft, that are controlled separately. Kids especially enjoy “the jail” (loft) where they feel like they have a secret hideaway. Conveniently located 5 minutes from a nice grocery store and a few restaurants, about 20 minutes to the Ft. Rucker Visitor Center in Dalesville. We would definitely stay here again!"

Even the trash can was spotless! There are a couple steps up to the kitchen/bathroom area and then a couple down to the master bedroom. Not a problem but just wanted to let folks know as I didn’t see them in the picture. Would definitely stay in any of Larry’s properties again. It was excellent!"

Once we arrived, we were immediately greeted by Larry with a smile! He and his family participated and it was wonderful! I never could of imagined such amazing hospitality from any Airbnb! The apartment itself I immediately felt comfortable and relaxed when I walked in. It’s a beautiful place and very clean! You definitely get your money’s worth and more! The location is so nice!

Stayed with kids","I travel to Enterprise with my daughter frequently to visit family in the area, and we have become fans of Larry's offerings. They are always spotless, convenient to the things we have planned to do, well furnished, and extremely comfortable for our needs. Larry is a fantastic host and is proactive with information and things we need to make our stay easy and comfortable. His rentals are a great value compared to a lot of others offered in the area and are our ""go-to"" rentals when we're in the area. We thoroughly enjoyed the rental and the hospitality as always, and hope to be back again soon."

Very fast on responses and very helpful. I can’t wait to come back. This is a great place to stay. I will definitely be back. I felt like I was at home. Made room for my family to park and visit.

The stairs are steep inside so keep that in mind for small children. My 7 year old thought inside was pretty cool and wanted to “stay forever”. We truly enjoyed our visit and would consider booking again if ever in the area. It certainly was worth it. Thanks Larry for your warm hospitality."

Stayed with kids","We needed a large home for all our family & we felt extremely comfortable here - 4 bedrooms, two full baths, full kitchen, large living room & laundry room. We were able to cook many meals in the kitchen & hang out as a family all under one roof. The home provided many thoughtful & helpful touches like a work desk, warm blankets & extra pillows, coffee & filters!!!, 2 smart TVs, toys & corn hole for the little ones, tasteful decor, well-lit entry, extremely comfortable beds to include a trundle bed for one of the grandkids, highchair, baby tub, playpen & outdoor/firepit chairs for both the adults and kids. Although we did not need anything pet-related, we noticed a nice pet bed plus food bowls & dry food for both cats & dogs. The carport allowed for easy entrance to the side of the house & a circular driveway allowed for easy parking & entry to the front of the house. The fenced in the backyard was large, pretty & private - the grandkids really enjoyed playing in the backyard!"

Stayed with a pet",Property was easy to find and Maria was easy to reach when the digital code did not work. Inside the home was very clean and inviting with all the amenities and cleaning product available to clean after ourselves. Backyard is fenced and peaceful there is a large amount gap underneath the fence for small dogs to potentially get outside the compound. Also I dislike most dog owners since they can clean after their pets. My daughter cleaned multiple dog feces (not all) from the backyard so she and her brothers could run outside without stepping in poop. She did (as always) go outside with her dog and clean her dogs mess as to not contribute to the left behind messes. The street in the front is also busy with high speed traveling cars and trucks and would not recommend small kids or pets in the front only the back. Plenty of space to park vehicles as we had 5 with us for our military PCS move. Overall very satisfied with our stay even with the previous slack dog owners trying to ruin it.

Stayed with kids","We were in town for my daughter's wedding. Had a hiccup getting in but that was quickly resolved. No problems after that. If we had questions Maria responded quickly. All of the bedrooms were nice size. The bed in the master bedroom is quite low to the floor, this is only a problem if you have mobility issues like I do, I just slept in another bed and our toddler granddaughter slept in the master bedroom with her Pepaw and the 1 year old slept in the travel playpen provided at the rental house also in master bedroom and still left plenty of room to walk. Bathrooms are nice, the toilets are a little low, again not a problem unless you have mobility issues like me so I carry a raised toilet seat for that reason. The house is child friendly but not child proof. There are cleaning supplies in the cabinet under the kitchen sink that is not lockable. The house had everything listed in amenities. We would definitely stay here again. Thanks for the hospitality!"

Stayed with kids","This place was excellent. We had a great time here and Maria was very helpful. We let her know we would be arriving late and she left a light on for us. Also, the house was very clean and close to town. However, it is on a main road, but has a side street and a nice private backyard. We didn’t notice much noise from the traffic other than occasional cars passing. Maria was very helpful, especially when we had some unexpected visitors knocking on the door late at night. Maria answered her phone on the first call and checked the exterior cameras. She also kept an eye on the cameras and notified me when she saw another unexpected visitor. We later determined that someone down the road was having a party and some of the party goers we confused with the address. This only happened one night of our stay, the rest of the days were no problem at all and the neighborhood appeared quiet otherwise. Would would definitely recommend and stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","We stayed at this property August 30-September 1, 2022 when we travelled to Alabama to see our son graduate from AIT training at Fort Rucker Army Base. The house was clean and decorated very nice. The location of the home was very quiet and peaceful. The layout of the home was perfect because there were three bedrooms including the master at one end of the house and one bedroom at the opposite end of the house which worked out perfect for the teenage girls in our family.
There are a few things I want to say about this host. First, we had to change our reservation because my son's graduation date was pushed about a week. The host, Maria, allowed us to change our reservation with no additional charge and was so accommodating to us during this stressful time.
Second, when we arrived at the home, the air conditioning wasn't working properly. The house was 85 degrees and much too warm for my comfort. We set the thermostat to 74 but by morning the temperature had only dropped to 79 after running four about 8 hours (again too warm for my comfort). In addition to the AC issue, the toilet in the master bathroom ran on and off all night long. I contacted Maria right away about both issues. Not only did she respond within 4 minutes of my message, she had both a plumber and an HVAC technician to the house within an hour to take care of both issues. Unfortunately, the AC didn't seem to improve much so I reached out to Maria again to let her know. She was very apologetic for the inconvenience and since she didn't know if her HVAC guy could come back the same day, she had her handyman run to the store and get us three wonderful tower fans which we used that night, and it made a huge difference.
Given the few issues we had, I would definitely rent from this host again. She was on top of everything, and I feel she went above and beyond to make sure our stay was the best it could be.
Thank you, Maria and Andrew. You are both fantastic hosts and I would recommend you to anyone looking for a nice AirBNB in Enterprise, Alabama.

The backyard was the most beautiful oasis and the perfect safe place for a toddler to run around, equipped with toddler size Adirondack style chairs, a sandbox, a swing in the sunroom, Amazon prime for Cocomelon, and even a pull out floor mattress so there is no worry of toddler falling out of bed at night. There was also a pack n play and a high chair which we used for our infant! All necesseities like dishwasher detergent, plates, cups, dishes, pizza cutter, laundry detergent, paper towels were provided in excess where we didnt have to worry about running out. This was the perfect place and we would definitely stay here again and for a longer stay if we had something else to do in Enterprise. It was the perfect stop for one night on the way to the beach but a fantastic little hideaway we would love to return to!"

Very close to fort Rucker for those going TDY with families and was perfect for our kids and dog as well. Cannot recommend enough and will be staying again next time we are in town."

With housing not secured before we got here, we needed a place to stay. Kristina’s place could not have been more perfect. Her townhouse is furnished and decorated to feel like home. Check-in was extremely easy with our door code. Our pets settled in nicely and it was so helpful to have a fenced-in yard. We couldn’t be more grateful to Kristina for being so helpful and accommodating to us. She is very responsive and understanding. We were sad to leave! I recommend a hundred times over.

Easy entry process, but fair warning 2 small flights of stairs with no elevator , difficult for elderly. Huge kitchen with plenty of room to entertain family dinners. Long Cozy couch to watch tv or enjoy game night.
Great Location downtown in Enterprise! Walking distance to a variety of local shops and small restaurants for full meals or breakfast, coffee and doughnuts, bars , farmers market, Southern Broadway dinner theater, clothing stores, book stores, candy and soap stores , unique souvenir shops even 2 baby stores offering 4D ultra sounds. In the heart of the Historic district full of history and great opportunities for pictures. You will hear local church bells in morning till evening . ER/ hospital close by, and Library to walk to."

Group trip","The positives: It’s a beautifully restored historic building. Very spacious and decorated beautifully. The furnishings are very comfortable. The beds were very comfortable and extra blankets were available. The location couldn’t be better. It’s within walking distance of several eateries, shopping and historic sites. Parking is on the Main Street and even though an event was going on, there was ample parking available. Enterprise itself is a fun place to explore.
Not so positive:
There’s no elevator. I think that should be mentioned in the description so guests are aware.
The staircase doesn’t have any railing for part of it and the railing that is on the upper level is loose. If someone leaned against it, I think it would give
I always leave the places I rent in good shape and automatically clean up but we were expected to wash, dry, fold and put away the extra blankets. I feel that is asking a bit too much.
Supplies like toilet paper, trash bags, soap, etc., were minimal or not provided.
There is a Keurig coffee maker - not mentioned in description, so I didn’t know to bring K-cups.
In summary, it’s a lovely place to stay, just be aware of the above items."

The restaurant in the Rawls hotel is perfect for any special occasion dinner, we loved the player baby grand piano and we were serenaded by our waiter as well.

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I stayed in the loft while attending an event for our son at nearby Fort Rucker. We were very pleased with the prompt and courteous communications we received from Cara. Everything in the booking went smoothly. We arrived in the early evening and were quite pleased to find some of the lights on and the A/C set to a comfortable temperature when we arrived. We were quite road-weary, and this was a nice and welcoming touch. We were able to park in a parking lot just across from the entrance door on the side of the building, which was very convenient.
The loft was a lovely mix of historic and modern updates. The brick walls, high ceilings and wooden floors meshed well with the updated kitchen and baths and the wall-mounted televisions. The loft was well-decorated and comfortable. Everything was clean and neat and orderly and exactly as described in the listing. The bed was comfortable and there was plenty of hot water for showers. Being that there were only the two of us, we were swimming in all of the space, and it felt kind of elegant. Our military son came by to see the place and deemed it ""a really neat place"".
Others have commented on the street noise, and we got to experience some of it. We were awakened on Friday morning by the city street cleaner at 4 a.m. as it made its way down Main Street. We were getting up early, anyway, so it wasn't too big of a deal for us. The street cleaner returned to clean the street next to the loft at 6 a.m. We were preparing to leave for our day at this point, so again it wasn't an issue. While it was a bit noisy at a very early hour, we recognized that we were living in a downtown setting and also appreciated the city's desire to have clean streets.
In the evenings and overnight, there were several ""vehicular enthusiasts"" who liked to rev their engines as they raced down Main Street, but there's nothing that can be done about that. We normally live in a very quiet, rural area, so having to deal with some ""city"" noise was a change for us, but not so much as to make us unhappy. The bell tower tolling throughout the day was actually quite pleasant, and it didn't bother us at all. The noises we heard were understandable and did not detract from our stay. We mention it only to let others know what to possibly expect and to have reasonable expectations. We chalked it up to being in an urban setting and just rolled with it.
We were there three days and two nights, and it suited our needs perfectly. Local businesses were plentiful and all within walking distance. The Downtown Donuts shop a few blocks away was well worth the walk on Saturday morning. Getting to Fort Rucker and around to various stores and restaurants around the area was easy. Coming back each night to the loft was a pleasure.
Check out was as easy as it gets: clean up after yourself, leave the bed unmade so they know where you slept, take out the trash, turn up the thermostat, turn off the lights and lock your door on the way out. Couldn't have been simpler or more straight-forward.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the loft and would stay there again if we travel to Enterprise in the future. The mild inconvenience of some street noise is not enough to keep us from returning. The vintage loft with modern conveniences was well-worth it. Staying there made our trip much more enjoyable and memorable than staying in a hotel. The loft has character and charm and history. That we would stay there again is as good an endorsement as we can give."

Stayed a few nights","Pretty nice place. We liked the location, being right in the downtown area. The restaurants and shops close by were awesome (Coffee Corner, Annie’s, Cafe Roma, Downtown Donuts), but the church bells across the street go off every hour on the hour (8 AM until 9 PM). The bells also go off for 15 minutes straight at 8 AM, 12 PM, and 5 PM - something to keep in mind if you’re a light sleeper, because the walls in the master bedroom are paper thin. You’ll be woken up all night by loud cars driving by and promptly at 8 AM by your 15 minute church-bell alarm. However, the bed is very comfortable. The other bedroom is MUCH quieter and still has a nice queen size bed, and the tv is way closer to the bed which is nice too! The kitchen has basic utensils and pans, but the cabinets and drawers have a weird smell, so we washed everything before using it. And if you’re going to cook, you’ll need to buy your own salt, pepper, and every basic cooking need. The balcony is pretty but it’s not accessible. We also saw several small roaches, flies, and other bugs. The bathtub in the master bathroom has jacuzzi settings, but started oozing this gross yellow stuff when we tried to use it. The bare minimum of towels, toilet paper, and paper towels is provided. It was enough for 2 of us for 2 nights, but if you’re staying for a week with more than 2 people, it would be frustrating having to bring your own toilet paper. Overall, it was a fine place to stay. Very very spacious, easy check in and check out, mostly nice location."

Stayed with kids","This is our second time having stayed at Scott's listing and things went perfectly both times! The unit is as described, very clean, comfortable beds, seamless check-in, and great A/C (which is a must for us). The only call-out (which is no fault of the owners) is that this listing is located near a busy highway, so the road noise bothers me a bit when it's time for bed (only bc I need it silent to fall asleep). It didn't bother the other guests who were with me, so I slept with a sound machine and that did the trick for me! Just something to be aware of.
SUPER kid-friendly. They have toddler cups, a high chair, a pack and play and even a few toys. The kitchen is also equipped with everything you need to cook.
Scott is thoughtful and incredible host - extremely responsive and even accommodated a last-minute late check out request. We will absolutely stay here again!"

Scott was appropriately apologetic and was willing to find a remedy, but unfortunately getting into a dirty bed cannot really be fixed. I believe once the cleaning issues are resolved, Scott’s place will be a gem."

The house is at the entrance of a quiet little neighborhood. We felt safe and comfortable. Check in and check out were simple. Communication was easy.

Stayed with kids","We cannot give a high enough recommendation for this place. We had a last minute booking as we found ourselves at a less than desired rental home during our family road-trip. It was our son’s birthday and the hosts kindly welcomed our late arrival with personalized amenities to support our family movie night.
The home was incredibly clean and comfortable. Good shower pressure, fans in every room, comfortable beds and bedding. Carport was a plus to keep our car safe and reduce the heat.
The hosts go out of their way to ensure the stay is comfortable and accommodating. They communicate with kindness and expediency.
My kids renamed it the “sunny home” based on the awesome sunporch. My husband and I enjoyed coffee (provided by the hosts) on the sunporch as we planned out the next leg of our road-trip.
The value cannot be beat for the level of attention provided by the hosts.
Highly recommend staying at LA the next time you pass through the area!"

Living room was nice and comfortable. If you have more than four people staying I would recommend a few more chairs for the dining table. Also, bring your own shampoo & conditioner if needed. Nice outside screened in porch with table. Some noise does filter from room to room and a tiny bit of traffic noise, so if you are a sensitive sleeper bring earplugs."

When we arrived the home was extremely clean. I own a cleaning company and I tend to be a harsh critic on rentals. I could not complain at all! The layout of the house was perfect for our group and the two full bathrooms were a plus. Beds were comfortable, bathroom towels were high quality, and the wine left was the extra little touch that showed the owners cared. I would highly recommend this home to anyone and definitely will book again if we are back in the area."

Group trip","This house worked out perfect for our stay and visit back and forth to Fort Rucker. The kitchen was furnished with pots and pans and a few baking dishes so cooking was easy. Added touches of soap, dishwashing tabs and laundry tabs were very helpful. Very clean. Loved the screened porch on the mornings and evenings! We will be back!"

Stayed a few nights",We really enjoyed our stay. The house was perfect for our family of 5. Love the updated home. Had everything we needed. So close to Ft. Rucker. Scott was quick to respond to my communications. Wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the screened in porch and fire pit.

Stayed with kids",We absolutely loved the home. The host was quick to respond and accommodate. The home is plenty spacious for a larger family or multiples. Would gladly rent the home again if we’re in the area!
