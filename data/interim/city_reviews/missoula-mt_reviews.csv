We definitely could have used an extra mirror or two, the only one is located in the bathroom. Parking isn’t the greatest right in front of the apartment, luckily we had a small SUV that could fit in tiny spots."

Stayed with kids","It worked well for us - honestly tho the pictures looked way better than the place does in person. Its pretty small with old carpet but cute. One kid slept on the couch which was not very comfortable, I just stuffed the cracks with a towel to make it flatter and added a comforter below so it wasn't so hard. Had to go hunting for some linens and blankets for the couch but found them. The kitchen was really well stocked and I appreciated the provided coffee and there was extras too that we didn't use. So kind. No problem parking. It's a small apartment that is part of a larger house so a lot of people around but no noise. It was overall a very nice stay."

You don’t get that kind of experience at a hotel. Very comfy bed and roomy bathroom! Really feel this place was an excellent value and experience.

Stayed about a week","Jennifer is rightly a super host. Her place is full of light, super clean, stocked with safe cleaning supplies . The apartment is centrally located but quiet. We were treated cordially by the long term tenants of the building, who jumped to assist us ""older folks"" with information and kind welcome.
This dwelling has real bathroom supplies, enough kitchen basics to get through supper and breakfast in a last minute stay with high quality, no dollar store stuff here. A strong air purifier runs 24/7. Cable and internet are top notch.
This place embodies everything lovely about the ""Missoula vibe.""
A special Shout-out to Jennifer: when I expressed concern about their second floor location and how we slightly older folks might be a bit worried: We stayed in for a snow day Tuesday. We ventured out Wednesday with ice trax in hand.....and the steps were clear and dry along with the entire walkway.....and we slept through it all.
This is a wonderful place."

Stayed a few nights","My SigO and I visited my mother in Missoula this past week, and stayed at Jennifer’s apartment near downtown. The location was central to every place we wanted to visit: a great grocery store, restaurants, shops (Rockin’ Rudy’s is around the corner), First Friday Art Walk, parks, mom’s house, etc.
The apartment was super cute, cozy and clean. The bathroom and kitchen were well stocked with all of the necessities, including a coffee grinder and French press. I’m sure we used more of the supplied coffee beans than the average guests. Haha.
Jennifer is a gracious host, who went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed.
We will definitely stay here again, if available, on our next visit."

Jennifer was super responsive and friendly. I arrived earlier than expected and she was receptive to letting me drop by bags off while the unit was being readied for my visit. Will definitely stay here again if I find myself in Missoula to listen to music at Bonner."

Stayed with kids","My husband and I road-tripped from Seattle to Missoula with our 3-week old baby for the wedding of our dear friend. Our stay at Jennifer’s place made it all possible. We could venture out on foot to the Hip Strip, River front walks, and beyond. There was plenty of space for the pack-and-play and the full kitchen had everything we needed to cook a few times for ourselves during our four night stay. The bed was very comfortable and the soaps in the bathroom were high quality- that sounds like a funny thing to highlight, but when you don’t get much sleep with a newborn, the morning shower with nice soap makes all the difference… as does the coffee and tea that were stocked in the kitchen. Jennifer has really thought of everything! Thank you!"

Stayed a few nights","Jennifer's apartment is the ideal place to spend time in Missoula! I felt like I was in my own nest there, the quiet location is ideal - end of street/cul-de-sac with parking out front, couple blocks from the ""hip strip"" with great restaurants and the riverfront trails, and downtown across the bridge. One block from a neighborhood grocer, and very private. The apartment is adorable, with personal touches and fully stocked kitchen great to cook in. Big comfy chairs for coffee in the morning sun. Comfy bed. Really just a sweet place to stay. Highly recommended!!!"

Stayed a few nights","This ""hip strip"" location hosted by Jennifer is the perfect location for a solo traveler or a couple. it is minutes to everywhere - downtown, the river, the eponymous Hip Strip, the campus - but at the seem time it is quiet and makes sleeping and relaxing easy.
The location is very well stocked, especially if you are a coffee enthusiast. I found organic fair trade caffeinated and decaf coffees, multiple sweeteners, and even a choice of a ""Mr Coffee"" type brewing device and a French press.
the furniture is neo-retro, and is both funky and comfy. I am a picky person when it comes to bedding, and the main bed, its linens, and its pillows all get high marks from me.
P.S. I lovedd the ""Missoula Intersections"" poster on the living room wall that I found it on Etsy and ordered one for myself and one for my brother."

Stayed one night","Naomi has so many sweet touches. I found her place to be perfect for the road weary. Very clean, open space to set my bags down, colorful and inviting space, clear directions and a cold beverage (or hot) waiting. The chips and salsa were a sweet touch too. In my opinion, even if my husband had been there, we would not have felt cramped. We would've had plenty of room to watch tv, to stretch out w our travel yoga mat, make a little dinner. I love that the bathroom is not close to the bed so even though it's small ,one feele like you enjoy privacy in the bathroom. It's a magic space that is quite small but does not feel that way at all. The water pressure in the shower is great and the sheets terrific. Naomi is a thoughtful and amazing host! I'm looking foward to staying there again."

Stayed one night","Great, cozy place filled with wonderful natural light..... I would stay again. Felt relaxed and safe and sweet after two weeks of wilderness and intense outdoors exertion. As a woman traveling solo, this is just what I needed. To be able to sleep in the fresh and soft linens, take a long shower, and catch up on emails (good wifi) after being out of touch with folks was relaxing and nice. The kitchen had it all and I could cook meals in and not have to go out. The sunlight coming in (I loved that sooo much!), being up in the trees at bird level with lilacs right outside, the little flowers from the garden left in a vase and obviously just picked. Home-made salsa left in the fridge with a bag of chips to go with... (what a sweet surprise!) You can tell she just loves really following through and going the extra mile to REALLY make sure you have everything you need - and more. She is very thorough in her communication and I appreciated that being a detail-oriented person myself. LOVED."

Then it was the little touches, like extra pillows and towels, and I was thrilled with the color therapy dual showerheads.
I really appreciated how responsive Naomi was when I needed something for the kitchen, which was sweet and easy to use. I loved how everything was labeled which really set my mind at ease. It’s obvious that Naomi is conscientious and adheres to all the safety protocols. It was the exact sanctuary that I needed and it was wonderful to have the whole place to myself.
I loved being able to get fresh greens out of the garden for my morning shake. The location was perfect for me. Very central and it’s close to a health-food store and a wonderful river walking path. I would definitely stay here again and would love to come back and stay during each season."

The outside chairs on the landing entrance to the loft were nice although scenery is not that enticing from up there and we didn’t use them.

Quite location next to Matts home that is close to the river and parks.

And the house itself has a nice layout, very comfy. The A/C was provided only through the bedroom, but letting it run with the door open did take care of the rest of the house. The location was very convenient in many ways."

Stayed a few nights","My recent stay at this apartment in downtown Missoula was fantastic! The check-in process was a breeze thanks to the easy-to-follow instructions provided by the host. The apartment itself may be small, but it's cleverly designed with great amenities that make the most of the space.
The decor was stylish and modern, and the furniture was comfortable and in excellent condition. However, I must mention that while the bed was cozy, it wasn't the most comfortable I've slept on. I would recommend bringing your own pillows if you're particular about them.
One minor issue was that the room could get a bit stuffy due to the radiator, but opening the windows helped to alleviate this. Despite these small quirks, my overall experience was very positive.
The best part of this apartment is its unbeatable location. It's close to numerous shops, restaurants, the hip strip, and the river, making it easy to explore everything that downtown Missoula has to offer. I enjoyed strolling along the riverban"

Also the elevator took multiple attempts to work. Once we found the lock box for the entry key and saw that it was under the bridge it made sense, but there was some confusion to the location and the parking. The location feels very safe and many cute shops and restaurants within an easy walk."

The kitchen is well stocked but pretty basic, with a small fridge and two-burner electric cooktop, so don't plan on doing any major cooking. But, with so many great restaurants a short walk away, why would you? Communication with the hosts was quick and helpful. Would definitely stay again."

Located halfway between the two fun shopping areas, you're right at the bridge and can walk everywhere in town. The view out one side is the river where you can wander to in less than five mins to catch the surfers and kayakers on the wave. The other views are of the town and city, and there's a nice reading nook in one of the windows.
We visited the one full week of the year that it rained every.day so we were glad to have the included underground parking.
Nicole and Andy are responsive and were quick with answers/suggestions to any of our Qs.
I'd stay here again in future.

The place is as described and well appointed. If you are a walker, the campus and downtown are easily accessible. My wife and I did a 3.8 mile walk through campus (which I attended 45 years ago) then toward downtown for a nice dinner at Ciao Mambo Italian restaurant, ice cream at Sweet Peaks, and finally strolled around downtown before heading back to the house. Missoula is an energetic and exciting town. People were out and about all over town for a Wednesday. We highly recommend the Poplar Retreat for a relaxing and comfortable stay in Missoula."

After opening the coded lock, was greeted with a very inviting space. From the attractive wood floors to the sleek loveseat, the more than ample kitchen, the very comfortable bed, and the deep claw foot bathtub, we were pleased and impressed with it all. What's more, it was pretty darn cold outside, but the house was toasty warm.
The location is perfect for access to the University and downtown, both of which are walkable.
Looking for a comfortably appointed, reasonably priced, easily accessible place in Missoula? Then you can't go wrong with Eric's place."

Stayed one night","The night and daytime trains pass every hour that make their horn sound for 2 minutes. This was really very loud so we didn't sleep not even with earplugs. This should be mentioned in the listing. On the fridge and around the window frames there was a lot of dust and dead insects. There were too few cooking pots to prepare a full-fledged meal. A cleaning fee of 38 euros is very high in this case because you have to take away your garbage yourself, wash the towels and do the dishes. The accommodation itself was cozy and pleasant. Sorry about the area."

Location was the main attraction for us, as we drove to Missoula from Helena to see Nathaniel Rateliff and the Night Sweats at Kettlehouse Amphitheater. It's right off the Interstate and only a mile away from the Top Hat in case you plan to take the shuttle (wish we did that).
I can't say enough about how cute this place was, how quiet the neighborhood was, and there was place plenty of parking. Will go back in the future! 👍👍"

NOTE: For the noise sensitive, while the neighborhood is sleepy and quiet, there is a freight train that passes multiple times during the day/night. This train will blow its horn while going over a nearby crossing, so if you are noise sensitive, this may be a problem for you."

CLEAN, everything was perfectly clean and not a speck of dirt or dust anywhere!
Kitchen had dishes, pots and pans which was a welcome surprise for us. Lots of storage and a very nice bathroom :)
The hottest day was Saturday and Eric went out of his way to put not one but TWO air conditioners in so we were comfortable. We were very grateful.
Only downsides are that the curtains were almost sheer, so the living room felt like everyone could see us... and that the water heater did not last very long.
9.5 out of 10 for us!!!!! We will definitely be renting again next year for MaggotFest if it's available!!! Thank you very much Eric!"

Stayed one night","We stopped at Eric's place for a night just to break up the drive between Yellowstone and Glacier and to just check out Missoula. So this place was perfect for a night. It was small (which we knew) with TV and coffee pot in the bedroom so I don't think most folks will want to spend a lot of time in the apartment. On the flip side, it was a great location. Right off the highway (NO highway noise at all), less than a mile to main street with lots of bars/restaurants and if you want a little exercise, it is two blocks away from the Mt. Jumbo Trailhead which we go up early and hiked. The place was emaculate and the coffee beans and grinder were an awesome touch. There was a little yard (kudo's to Eric on the lawn!!!) with chairs. We sat outside in 72F weather and enjoyed a cocktail and sat in the late September sun. After that, we drove into town, had a nice dinner and the next morning we went for a hike and were on the road by 9am. Short but sweet stay!"

Eric let us park the trailer in the garage. Located near I-90, and several breakfast places, it was easy to get back on the road after a good night's sleep."

I have yet to stay at a place this clean, and I was very impressed with how homey and personable it felt. They truly thought of everything, from shampoo and conditioner to a sound machine. They also have guest parking, so it was very convenient to park my car outside. The neighborhood was beautiful, facing the mountains and very quiet. As someone traveling alone, I was deeply grateful for their recommendations and their quick response time. 5/5 stars. Would highly recommend!"

I would recommend this rental for someone that is looking for a good value that offers some nice accommodations. There is a steep & narrow spiral staircase up to the rental which could be an issue for some people. We are in excellent shape but it was difficult to take up heavy or larger luggage. Other reviews mentioned loud noises at night. We personally didn't find this a problem with a fan running. However there are ear plugs and a noise machine for those who would like to use them.

On to the important stuff… first of all, the description and pictures are 100% accurate. Next, it is extremely clean and well stocked. They have thought of most everything.
What else is important? The unit is very well laid out. Info on WiFi, heat, etc. is easy to find. The bed was comfortable and I loved the white noise machine. Yes, it is close to the interstate, but I did not find it intrusive.
The convenience store across the street was super handy, too.
Downtown is a quick 5 minute drive and Thayler recommended a great place to eat too.
Overall, this is how you want your AirBnb experience to be."

The tv had good wifi connection and we were able to download our Disney plus app to watch select shows! Showers worked great- amenities like hairdryer and flat iron were even provided- nice touch! Host was great keeping in touch if we needed anything. Be forewarned that rumbling and shaking happened each night around 10-11pm - possible train nearby???

Emily and Thayer have thought out all their guests needs. I did take take a star off for “location” because the apartment is located on the back side of a convenience store stop.

Stayed a few nights","This was the perfect place to stay for a couple days to explore Missoula. The space is the perfect size to accommodate a couple people, and had everything you could need -- even a curling iron! It's close to town, the university, and is very conveniently located right off the freeway. The hosts were super communicative and helpful with the check-in process, and also offered assistance should I need anything. I saw a couple reviews noting the noisiness at night, but it didn't bother me at all -- for anyone who's not used to complete silence, it will likely be a pleasant white-noise. Will definitely stay again if I find the need to stay in the area in the future!"

There was a bottle of wine and some snacks waiting for us as well (included). Wifi with password was easy to find and connect to. And there was a hair straightener we could use, which was so fun after a week of camping! We didn't spend too much time at the AirBnB, as we went into town for the evening. But we enjoyed the time there. I could hear some traffic at night as it is close to the freeway, but was still able to sleep fine. It was easy to make coffee in the morning in the small kitchen. It would have been too far to walk downtown, but was just a 5 minute drive away. We enjoyed this place and would definitely stay here again!"

This was my first stay at an AirBnB and if every host is like Mike, then I will be staying at more. The process was very easy and after I booked my room, Mike contacted me immediately and told me that a guest was staying longer and offered another room, with a private bathroom for a little more money. It was a bargain!
The house, my room and bathroom were very clean and comfortable. I had my own key for the lock and access to the kitchen, living room, which had an inset fireplace, and laundry if I wanted. I was in Missoula visiting my son so I only saw Mike the first night and the day before I left. Both times, I felt comfortable with him and wished that I had been able to spend more time with him but my son had plans for me! I was able to meet two other guests who were also friendly. The atmosphere at Mike’s felt like a home away from home.
Do NOT hesitate when deciding if you should stay at Mike’s. You SHOULD!"

Stayed over a week","Mike's home is a level above Super Host. I was at Mike's for 5 months as I transitioned to Missoula. Mike is a rare human in that he's sincerely thoughtful about your comfort. His home is extra clean and comfortable and is situated in a quiet neighborhood in the best part of Missoula. His local suggestions from bakeries and restaurants to the nearest biking trails and events are better than a professional guide. You can choose quiet solitude or mingle with Mike and other guests in harmony. Mike was a chef and you'll find all the latest kitchen gear featured on America's Test Kitchen to cook with. Plus, Mike always seems to be making fresh bread so the whole house smells like freshly baked bread and so beautifully done like a photo from a cookbook. There is no better home in Missoula to stay for one night or several months as I did. Mike has all the amenities, modern tasteful furnishings and much more and you'll be more comfortable and cared for than the finest hotels in America."

Stayed a few nights","The Goose room was a dream come true after a long, smoky drive from Billings. The king bed was so comfortable with perfect linens and fluffy pillows. The private attached bathroom was a sweet spot to decompress in a hot shower. It was a delight to leave my mess of luggage in the walk-in closet with dresser drawers, where I could shut the door and relax. The desk in the bedroom was charming and utilitarian with a comfortable chair. Fast wi-fi and a window unit for extra A/C comfort. The kitchen was fully stocked and labeled with shareable items. The living room was so comfortable for reading and winding down. The designated parking spot and keypad entry made the whole check-in a breeze. The neighborhood was lovely and close to everything and as a cherry on top, Mike was a fantastic resource on what’s cool as well as a pleasantly social but unobtrusive host. I enjoyed my time here greatly and *will* be a repeat visitor the next time I’m in Missoula! Excellent place to be!"

He was kind enough to upgrade my room, as well, which was a nice and unexpected! The free bus is just a 2 minute walk away from the property, which saved us a ton of money on rental cars or Lyft. I'd definitely stay at this property with Mike again!"

Amenities such as bathrobes and bath salts, charcuterie boards and cutlery, fluffy comforters and knit booties, made us feel pampered and relaxed. It is quiet as a church. There are lots of windows, but also black shades that can be drawn for near-complete darkness. Best of all, there are actual paintings that are actually good and a lovely, eclectic pottery selection that honors Missoula's ceramic heritage -- try finding that in a hotel."

Stayed one night","Ann's room with bathroom was fully stocked (really too stocked) with items you might need/want during your stay. The bed was comfy and the location close enough to walk to all things Hip-Strip and the UofM. Perfect place for a night or two. The bedroom has some really cool items but there is so...much...stuff (books, chachkies, linens) that it makes it hard to keep track of your own things and find places to put them. The bathroom is very dark. There's only one bulb above the mirror which makes it challenging to put on make-up or take a shower after dark. The room is located on the first floor. If there are guests upstairs, you will hear them. There is a designated parking pad close to the door which is great. Maneuvering out of the neighborhood is a bit tricky due to Front Street being a one way street. You have to cheat the wrong way (just a hair) if you want to go downtown. Not a deal breaker but a need to know. I met Ann real quick and she was helpful and Missoula cool!"

Traffic noise from busy street bridge (next door & slightly above) and train whistle (~6 blocks away) was not an issue for us. Its Fall and windows were kept closed.
Lovely overnight stay."

Stayed with a pet","Ann thought of everything to make this space comfy and homey. The bed was so comfortable that it was hard to get out of in the mornings!!Beautiful surroundings and right next to the river that was great for walking our 2 little dachshunds.
We had to take our truck in for some surprise repairs which caused us to have to stay longer than expected. Ann tried to get us another apartment but everything she had was booked. She was generous enough to let us load up our luggage in her car and drive us to our next destination. She really goes out of her way for her guests!! Thank you, Ann!!! We will be checking for availability on our way back through!!"

We appreciated the coffee station and mini fridge plus the extra touches like flowers and robes. Her local recommendation sheets were packed with useful info (and funny commentary) for nearby restaurants and activities, including an awesome brewery/taco spot and a delicious bakery. Comfy bed, too. Wish we'd had more time to explore the neighborhood (many walkable things nearby!) but we were just stopping for one night on a longer road trip. Hope to visit again!"

The eye candy of beautiful landscaping around the cottage was only a foretaste of what was inside. There was such an attention to detail in each little comfy chair, cozy dinner table, and decor. It is a small area but did not feel cramped. There are long term guests on other floors but the sounds were minimal - I slept like a baby. You never fully know what you might find when picking online lodging but this host and cottage are worth commending and recommending."

This sweet little place exceeded our expectations; it was private, inviting, cozy, comfy; we slept like logs in the supportive, dreamy bed. The owners could not have been more thoughtful when it came to appointing this space with lovely, useful furniture (such as the antiquated hutch with coffee, tea, cutting board and knife); we left feeling rested and inspired. Oh, and we walked everywhere from/to this darling home base; to the river, to campus, to get pizza...! Looking forward to spending more time in Missoula come next adventure, hopefully our dates will align with this delightful b n' b again. Thanks Ann!"

Stayed one night",Great location. We were in town to go to a show at the Wilma. We walked along the river to a great restaurant near the Wilma and then went to the show!

Stayed a few nights",This was such a nice place to stay! They even let my boyfriend borrow their iron so he could look pristine for his interview that we were in town for. Couldn’t have asked for anything better!

Stayed with a pet","I so enjoyed my stay at Ann's with my dog. The unit was perfect for my needs - comfortable bed, good light, mini-fridge, blazing fast internet. I did a lot of walking, and it was convenient to both recreational trails and the commercial center. Ann was very accommodating in every way, including making sure I was alerted as soon as the unit was clean for an early check in. I would definitely stay here again."

Stayed a few nights",We thoroughly enjoyed Ann’s space for our anniversary trip to Missoula! Close to downtown but peaceful. Ann was also incredibly responsive and even helped us out when our delivery food accidentally got delivered to the wrong address! Highly recommend.

Stayed one night","We booked this AirBnb as 2 Missoula locals wanting a night out, not in our own home! It was a lovely apartment space with tasteful decor, good heating and cooling and a stellar location in Missoula.
I will admit, we arrived fully expecting a kitchen space to cook dinner and breakfast the next day, so we were a little disappointed (mostly in our selves for not catching that when we booked the place) that there was no kitchen, but Anne provides amenities like a water heater, coffee maker, water pitchers, mini fridge and microwave, so everything ended up working out just fine.
It was a pleasure to stay in the Iconic green building that is such a staple to the entrance of Missoula, and I would absolutely do it again!"

Stayed one night","I loved the decor of the room, the use of antique furniture, the carpets that covered the concrete floor etc. The bed was compfy which is key to a good night's stay! Our pet was allowed and we know where to take her around town to run and play etc. this might have been tricky for others without that information. The BEST amenity was a little fridge with 1/2 & 1/2 in it! This made my day. Because we had to get up and out so early we actually didn't take advantage of this wonderful amenity but for those of us who put cream in our coffee this is a deal maker!
In addition, I left a pair of earrings there and she responded right away and provided me with an opportunity to retrieve them easily. I would rent here again in a minute."
