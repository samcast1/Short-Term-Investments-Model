Stayed a few nights",Loved this place and Cindy is excellent host! Very peaceful and serene with all the lake views. Close proximity to where we needed to be and to local area. Very cozy and loved the fireplace as the weather was not the best while we were there unfortunately. This will definitely be our go to place though for our future visits. Thank you!

Stayed with kids",My family of 3 had a great time at Cindy's Lakeside Haven. The view of the lake from the wall of windows all along the back of the house was outstanding. Everything was clean and neatly appointed. We really loved making use of the dock (and were so glad it wasn't a floating dock but stationary!) We used every single one of the water sport options and thoroughly enjoyed each one! We would love to come again. Cindy was responsive and helpful.

The view of the lake is incredible from inside or from the amazing deck!
The fire pit looks awesome !!
Want to come back when we can use it !
Great yard heading down to the lake.
The dock is very cool. Especially at night with lights edging it.
We loved the peacefulness and beautiful surroundings!! Nicest AirBnB I’ve ever stayed at!!"

Stayed with kids","We had a wonderful time at your lakeside house! The house was the perfect size for our family of 3, and the location is so beautiful and peaceful. Cindy was a great communicator and was really willing to go above and beyond if necessary - when we visited there had been an unexpected (and short-lived) snow storm the night beythat knocked power out at the lake house. Cindy kept us informed about the power status and even offered to let us spend the night in another studio property that she has for a night if we needed to. Fortunately the power came back on right before we were ready to check in! The kitchen was well-stocked and had everything we could have asked for."

Stayed a few nights","I had a lovely stay at this airbnb, the home is very clean and new. It was nice being next to the water and watching the ducks and eagles flying around. The home feels like stepping into an interior design magazine and the beds are comfortable. Cindy was a wonderful host who checked in with me on the first day and allowed me privacy the remaining days. While I stayed in the winter season I am sure the summer season would be wonderful since there amenities like the kayaks that would be perfect for summer. I especially loved the lake view from the living room and it was very calming and peaceful. I highly recommend this place!"

The amenities made you feel like you were staying in an upscale hotel. The host responded and helped us with everything we needed in more than a timely manner. They were very friendly and willing to do anything in their power to help make your stay amazing. I’ll definitely be coming back to this Airbnb anything I’m in Olympia.
THIS IS A MUST STAY LOCATION!!!"

Stayed a few nights","Words can’t express but I will try, this home was so comfortable and complete with everything you needed to feel at home away from home and then some. If you were to move in this home, you wouldn’t need anything but your clothes. It was so beautiful inside and out. Inside is like you would see in a magazine. The outside is just as nice . Very well lit up inside and out. First class barbecue, with a rotisserie Cindy purchased at my request. Cindy went out of her way to have everything we needed.
I haven’t even mentioned the views. To wake up in the morning, get your coffee and to look out over the lake and watch the ducks swimming and flying over the lake was so peaceful. The beautiful deck in the back , wall to wall windows to see from inside as well. Last but not least, is the train echoing over the lake with a beautiful sunset was like being in a movie.
I was so impressed that we are spoiled for future vacations. Cindy Thank You so much for sharing your home with us 😊"

Stayed over a week","Anne was a welcoming and flexible host. The accommodation was private and perfectly equipped. We were in Olympia to visit our daughter and her wife and were able to host them for a cooked meal given the excellent kitchen facilities and living area. The accommodation was equipped with everything we needed and Anne had also provided snacks, tea, coffee, milk and even a bottle of wine to help us settle in.
The local co-op store (open 7 days a week) and Bits cafe (open Fri, Sat, Sun) were very handy and the free bus (no 45) into Olympia or out to the Mall made a useful alternative to walking or using the hire car.
The local area was a quiet peaceful residential area and we felt very safe walking around at any time of day or night. There was also a pleasant woodland path and bayside park to walk to.
The bed was very comfortable and we enjoyed the outside seating area. We definitely plan to stay with Anne again, the next time we are over in Olympia!"

Stayed a few nights","We stayed at Anne's place for 5 nights and felt right at home from the moment we stepped into Fern's Cottage! It was wonderfully stocked and the little extras were such a welcoming and kind touch. The cottage is cozy and the bathroom was nice and spacious (which sometimes isn't always the case for smaller dwellings). The outside was beautiful and peaceful, and we had such a restful time. We both work from home and found the wifi speeds were great (worked well for the video calls I had!). If we need to stay again in the area we would return in a heartbeat, and definitely recommend this place for anyone visiting Olympia or the surrounding areas. Thanks again for a great stay, Anne!"

Well-furnished without being cluttered. And free of intrusive air scent products - Hurrah! For me, it's also very walkable to downtown- through the residential neighborhood & across the bridge."

It was SUPER clean, had lots of thoughtful amenities, a well-stocked kitchen, and a well-stocked bathroom. She left coffee and some snacks which was above and beyond. The space is updated and well laid out. The location is perfect, close enough to walk along the water and to walk to restaurants and stores if you wanted. The bed was extremely comfortable, I slept great! The outdoor space is peaceful. Anne was easy to communicate with and a very gracious host. I will book again if I can when I return. :)"

Stayed over a week","Stayed for 2 weeks. Needed a quiet, restful place to spend Christmas. Chose this lovely cottage for the high end finishings and gorgeous little kitchen. We are from scratch cooks and found the kitchen well stocked for the most part. Enjoyed cooking on the induction stove and being a short walk (less than 5 minutes) from the excellent organic produce at the Olympia Food Co-op. Bed was comfy, neither super soft or super firm.
Notes for future renters:
The hair product was a combination shampoo/conditioner so if you have easily tangled hair, bring your own conditioner. Great place for 1 person, or a couple comfortable with each other given the lack of privacy. It was perfect for us as a married couple. We would stay again."

Anne provided everything you need including extra pillows, extra towels, and binders with information about local amenities and attractions. The kitchen was well equipped. The little patio and garden area are very nice and private. It is a pretty quiet place to stay and still be close to downtown Olympia. Check in was a breeze since Anne leaves clear instructions for you. Wifi worked great as well! I hope her place is available the next time I am in the Olympia area."

The cottage is set in the back of the host's house but there is plenty of privacy and a patio just for the cottage. The bed is very comfortable and super quiet. Just a great alternative to staying in a hotel. I can't recommend it enough, we will be back!"

Stayed a few nights","To say that Anne’s place was perfect would not be an exaggeration. It is a beautiful, newly built, well-stocked and comfortable studio with some separation between kitchen, dining/sitting and sleeping areas. Anne has enhanced the space with a number of thoughtful, lovely touches, stocking the fridge and drawers with everything you will need and in addition to the usual and expected, also provided bars, half&half, coffee, tea, drinks, cheese and crackers, books, maps and brochures about Olympia and nearby attractions, and even a bottle of wine.
The house is on a hill above downtown, but it is easily accessible by a short walk or bike or drive. Anne also was very responsive and promptly answered questions we had. If/when we return to Olympia I’m sure we will visit this home again."

The self-contained cottage is immaculate and well equipped with all the conveniences. The location is excellent.
The host lives in the adjacent home. The cottage used to be the garage, and the two structures are close to one another. For somebody not used to having a host present, this is something to consider.
The guest shares a driveway with the host.
The bed is on the far end of the soft scale, meaning that it is very soft. I found it to be too soft."

There were so many special little touches throughout, and the cottage was impeccable and incredibly clean and spacious. Most Airbnb‘s don’t come with quite the extensive amenities that were available throughout, including generous kitchen items and ample supplies in the bathroom. Access was also wonderful and the location of the cottage itself was incredibly convenient to all the areas in Olympia one would want to get to. I would absolutely recommend Fern Cottage and if we ever had a need in the area, it’s the first place we will call. Anne is a wonderful host!!"

Stayed a few nights","Having stayed at Ana and Leika's place before, I knew what to expect and everything went very smoothly just as before, including pre-arrival communication, check in, and check out. Because I was in town on business, I wasn't around much during the day--was mainly there to sleep, shower, and eat breakfast--but while I was there, I felt very much at home. Although the bathroom is shared, it was always available when I needed it, and there was good off-street parking and plenty of refrigerator space for my three days' worth of groceries. Since the last time I stayed with Ana, she's taken in a couple pets which are both clean and well-behaved--Ana also checked with me to make sure that I didn't have pet allergies before I stayed. And since it was very warm when I stayed--it was in the 90s on one day--I appreciated that Ana already had a fan running in my room when I checked in and the room remained cool enough that I didn't have much trouble sleeping. Ana remembered me from my previous stay, so it was fun to catch up. I'd be happy to stay with her again!"

Stayed a few nights","This was my second stay at Anna’s place, and everything was pretty much as before—efficient check-in/check out, very neat and tidy space, and Anna remains a friendly and gracious host. Since I had stayed with Anna a few months earlier, there wasn’t need for an extensive check-in but Anna was around in case I had any questions and she also let me borrow her iron even though it wasn't included as one of the amenities inside the room. As with my previous stay, I was here for work so I wasn’t at the house much except to sleep and eat breakfast. This time, I found the freeway connections and commute to be a lot easier to navigate, although I did leave before the 8 am rush and was coming back at night well after evening rush hour—if you’re coming from the westside of Olympia/Tumwater after 8-9 pm on a weekday or even on Sunday afternoon, that stretch of 101 to I-5 is nice and clear. Unfortunately, I still haven’t had a chance to explore the area much, but this time I saw that there was a Safeway near the freeway and Anna’s place also appears to be close to the highest-rated Italian restaurant in Tumwater, so I’ll be sure to check those out next time I’m in town. During my previous stay, I found Farrelli’s to offer a decent pizza in a part of Lacey that’s maybe 10 mins. away by car Anna’s place, so that’s another reason to come back in addition to the good value and convenience that Anna’s place provides."

Stayed a few nights","I had a nice stay at Anne’s place, which is well represented in the photos provided on Airbnb. The entire place is very neat and tidy, and even though I was only there to sleep and eat breakfast, it appeared to have everything anyone would need to be comfortable. Anne has set aside room in the kitchen fridge for you and the individual bedroom also had a lock with key that provides an extra measure of security. Anne checked me in herself, and provided perhaps the most thorough check in I’ve had at an Airbnb. And in case you forget anything or check in yourself, she also has a handy preprinted guide that you can consult, complete with photos and detailed instructions for off-street parking. This was my first stay in Tumwater, and I found that this safe, quiet suburban location provides easy access to Olympia just an exit or two away on the freeway (also accessible by surface streets). It was easy to find Anne’s place from the freeway, but it’s a little tricky getting back on when you leave the first time—just make sure you use GPS or consult a map for that first foray. This was also the first time I’ve stayed at an Airbnb with a shared bath, but it was easy to coordinate—any possible inconvenience that might arise from a shared bath seems to have been considered in the pricing, which I believe to be quite fair. In any case, Anne is a friendly, very well organized host who’s excellent at communication… Even before this stay, I had already booked a second stay later in the fall and I’m already looking forward to returning…"

The house is a 2.5 mile 20-30 minute walk (5-minute drive) to downtown Olympia as well being close to Interstate 5. There's a small store down the street from her house in case you need anything. She offers amazing toiletries which were great after spending a week in a hostel in Portland where I used hand soap to wash my hair. The best part about the location was its essentially 2.0-2.5 hours from the national parks and cities.

This was our first time in Olympia and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.

Peggy's suite has really easy access to downtown Olympia and the I5, plus a nice neighbourhood bakery right around the corner.
Peggy also, tastefully, laid out some extra snacks, coffee pods, tea bags, and even spare toiletries. A VERY appreciated gesture.
Check-in/out was easy with the keypad door lock and it was easy to find out way to the suite.
The Mission Creek Nature Park (accessible through the back gate on the property), was a beautiful spot for a walk and to bask in the Pacific Northwest Nature."

Stocked very well with snacks, coffee, tea, essentials. She asked more than once if there was anything she could pick up for us. We walked often around the neighborhood which is super funky with lots of old houses that run the gamut in condition. I new the neighborhood with relatives 5 blocks away, which helps know the nice bakery is in easy walking distance. Although not sidewalks on every street, it is nice to walk the neighborhood. Interesting, charming, quiet, and the bakery! We hope to stay again when Peggy’s yard is in bloom.

Great, large TV positioned so it was easy to watch from bed and had lots of channels to watch. The bathroom was very well thought out, and Peggy provided thick, lush towels and nice smelling soaps and lotions. In the breakfast nook, there was plenty of room to store cold stuff in the fridge / freezer. We used the microwave, but not the toaster oven or coffee maker, but Peggy provided lots of snacks, hot apple cider, hot chocolate and coffee. Internet was very good and there were plenty of outlets to charge our phones and computers. Highly recommend Peggy's! Close to everything!"

Her place was spotless, cozy, and comfortable. She has the cutest cats who hang out in their catio outside, and you will not be disappointed by her AMAZING landscaping."

The bakery nearby was a short walk for breakfast as well. Finding the house was a breeze and we were grateful for the designated parking space off the road. Peggy’s instructions were super easy to follow, and she was always available to answer any questions. She really seemed to care that we settled comfortably and certainly made us feel welcome. Overall our stay was wonderful and we will definitely recommend this AirBnb to our friends and family in the future!"

Loved the gas fireplace! We wished we could have had more time to spend in her wonderful garden. She provided foods and a ""just in case you forgot"" box that were a nice touch. The only thing this room doesn't have is a kitchen sink but we didn't miss it. When we were leaving she gave us some yummy breakfast bread for the road. We wish we could have stayed longer. Thank you Peggy."

The airbnb is near to a very cute nature trail as well, so I did early morning walks. The garden is a lovely place; very peaceful and quirky. Make sure to read the check-in instructions clearly. I didn't and had trouble getting in (went to front of property instead of back. Again should have read instructions more clearly). Luckily, Peggy responded right away and was very helpful so it wasn't really an issue. A very cozy stay. Highly recommend. A gem!"

Stayed a few nights","Peggy's home is quite truly the best AirBnB I've stayed in. She's clearly thought about the needs of her guests and anticipated those needs. I really appreciated everything she's done. The bed is so comfortable, the linens lovely, and with a choice of layers to easily warm up or cool down. The kitchenette is thoughtfully stocked - hot beverage options with coffee, teas, cider, hot chocolate, and I really appreciated the snacks and oatmeal options. There are breakfast and other dining options in driving range, but so nice to be able to start my morning quietly. I've stayed in other places remote from any options including coffee shops that didn't even bother with a coffee maker, not nice! It was very cozy snuggling into a movie alone after a fun but busy day visiting with my small grandkids. In the morning I sat with my coffee by the window looking out at the garden which I will love to visit during the growing season. It looks amazing even in winter! Thanks, Peggy!"

From the beautiful gardens where we were offered to pick delicious fresh raspberries to the comfy space/bed, luxurious linens, fluffy towels, etc. etc.etc. everything was perfect!! We stayed till the very last minute as we hated to leave. I highly recommend staying here and my recommendations do not come lighty. As an added bonus there is a small park a few houses down that provides for a great little nature walk in the early evenings.
Thank you again Peggy for setting us up with the outdoor fireplaces, which was a treat given we are from FL and it isn't often we get to relax by a fire. We hope to come back one day!!!"

Stayed a few nights","This precious nature sanctuary was quiet, peaceful and stunning. Every comfort listed in the description and more. The space was perfect for two people. It was impeccably clean, cozy and spacious. Very convenient to downtown, hiking and various parts of the city. Peggy was the hostess with the “mostest”. And her garden was a wonderful sight to behold. Do yourself a favor, when in Olympia reserve this wonderful space. The best air bnb I have ever used."

Peggy, her accomodations and her gardens far exceeded the many other B&Bs that I have visited. Think fine linens, spacious rooms and a magical garden, for starters. She is at the ready to provide for her guests but does not hover. She goes well beyond (even lofty) expectations. See you soon and often, Peggy!"

Stet was there to greet us and gave us everything we needed and more! The location was wonderful, and we were within a short drive to access the Olympic and Rainier national parks! We did plenty on our trip, but waking up with the view of Burns Cove while sipping coffee (that our hosts graciously provided) in the rocking chairs and watching the wildlife had to be the best way I’ve spent mornings in recent memory. The grill and chairs outside were also wonderful way to soak up the view. So peaceful and serene… part of me wishes we just hung out at the cabin even more! Stet and Lynn were flexible with us at checkout, and were a resource for us to talk with. They were also eager to find out what we did so they can share it with future guests— now that’s good hosting! They were a blessing for my wife and I— highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights",Stet and Lynne were amazing host. Stet met us outside in the dark with a flashlight when we arrived and showed us right in to the cabin. He explained all the amenities inside the cabin and we were on our way to spending the first night there. What a peaceful place and an amazing view of the bay and the sunrise in the morning. We saw seals and birds in the bay during the day. Stet had the tide tables available for us and binoculars as well so we could have a better view. The cabin was equipped with everything you need for a getaway and the also had raisin bread and homemade granola for us which was delicious. Every morning we made our way to the barn to say hello to the horses and chickens and feed the horses some hay. They had a guest book where you can write about yourself and your stay at their cabin and were blessed to see a deer right by the porch on our last morning there. It was so much fun. We will gladly book again for our next stay in the Olympia area. Thank you!

The cabin is prefect for me and wife, it has the essentials and also includes extras like fresh eggs and homemade canola. The property is like a nature preserve, with great views of the bay from the covered deck. We have often seen bald eagles, deer (fauns in June time frame) and lots of water fowl (blue herons, ducks, and loons) and seals. There is a very good walking trail just up the road through an old growth forest. The property is in relatively close proximately to Olympia for restaurants or shopping. This property is a great place to stay!"

Stayed over a week","Stet was a great host meeting us as we pulled up. Gave us the key and made sure we had everything we needed including firewood for the small woodstove. The cabin was very clean. The small but efficient kitchen was stocked with homemade granola, coffee, filters, eggs, bagels, and milk to keep is going until we were able to get to the store.
The cabin has a great view perched right at the edge of the water. It is small though and although it did note this in the listing I don’t think I realized just how small the bathroom space was. If you are a larger person you may find the small shower a little too small and there was not a sink in the bathroom area meaning the only sink is in the kitchen.
All of this is in the cabin listing but I feel like a picture of the bathroom area would have been helpful in making our decision to stay as ultimately it ended up being a little too small for us, especially during the cold rainy winter months when getting outside is more of a challenge."

The kitchen worked well for us and is stocked with fresh eggs, and homemade granola. Stet is very helpful with any questions one may have about the area.

Recommend that you take his advice on local restaurants and hikes. The farm environment had lots to explore including the beach and horses and chickens. Will happily stay here again!
One note that I missed in the listing description - there are motion detector lights outside the cabin that can be disabled via a lightswitch just inside the door. They would turn on occasionally overnight - reading comprehension fail on my part for not realizing they could be turned off entirely!"

The deck with a covered portion was great for grilling and having dinner on the deck while watching the great views of the inlet. The views from the living room are equally good. The location is very quiet, no road noise and the inlet is shallow, so practically no boat traffic, which made for a very peaceful stay. During our stay in early June we saw 3 new born fawns, Bald Eagles, Blue Herons, and many rabbits. Stet and Lynn were very helpful with information about the area. I would highly recommend the cabin for any length stay."

This cabin is the gold standard. A full 10 out of 10. Amazing view of the sound from the living room of the cabin. High-quality yet simple kitchen. Amazing location. A wood-burning stove! But best of all, the hosts. Extremely kind and welcoming, and left me some fresh baked snacks and some other wholesome foods upon my arrival. (I like food, especially given in such a kind way)
The area is super fun to explore, and really good for taking long walks. I used my time for meditation, and working on some creative projects. I cannot wait to go back again. I left feeling recharged, calm, and delighted."

Stayed a few nights","This little cabin is the perfect place to unplug and take in the beautiful scenery. Stet was quick to respond to any inquiries that we made prior to our trip. He was detailed and thoughtful when it came to directions, greeting us at the driveway and making local recommendations. When you pull in there is a long gravel driveway, then the horse stalls, the main house, and your parking spot. You walk down a gravel path behind the main house, through the backyard about 100 feet to the cabin. The cabin was clean and warm upon arrival. The woodstove was set up and ready for us to light whenever we wanted to. There were spices, cooking oils, condiments, granola, fresh eggs, coffee, creamer and all of the kitchen things you would need to be able to make a nice meal. The bed was comfortable and so were the sheets/duvet. We both liked the shorter rocking chair lol, it was comfy. The bathroom is extra small but, it has the necessities. Stet & Lynn have a great guide that they leave for you. It outlines the property, nearby stores and favorite places, hospitals and safety information. The wifi was great, we streamed a movie on Netflix through our laptop and were able to watch a movie without any buffering. We stopped by and fed the horses each day that we were there. They were happy to see us when we walked up and we're friendly. We walked down a little trail to the water and saw oysters at low tide. There were different birds in the area and we liked the binoculars and bird book they set up at the window for us to use. Such a nice getaway, affordable and much more beautiful than the photos. You should definitely go if you're thinking about it!"

Be sure to spend some time with the horses, they’re adorable and both Lynne and Stet can tell you some interesting facts and stories about caring for horses. The cabin has all of life’s basic needs - a shower, a toilet, running water, hot water, stovetop, toaster oven, and pans and dishes. The view from the cabin is amazing, especially during sunrise.

The view is spectacular and you will lose time just rocking in a chair and staring out over the water, trying to identify all of the birds (we saw eagles and cranes, among many others). The cabin is well-furnished and cozy with every amenity we needed to make ourselves delicious meals (including plenty of breakfast items - farm fresh eggs, yum!) and firewood enough to keep a crackling fire going. Stet made sure we had a table upon which to do our puzzles (a favorite pastime) and Lynne dropped by mid-day on Saturday with biscotti hot from the oven (with the most delicious ginger orange glaze, fabulous!). We took the walk suggested in the welcome packet and passed through the barn on our way to say hi to the beautiful carriage horses.

Our host was very kind and hospitable. He took the utmost care of us while we stayed there. He remembered small details of comfort, like putting farm fresh eggs in the fridge so that we could have a solid breakfast before a long hike in the Olympic National Park. He had tips on local restaurants, local hikes, where to go in the nearby national parks, and he even had a huge jar of homemade granola! I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a peaceful, quiet, and calming retreat away. 10/10 recommend."

Stet was the perfect host with detailed directions and met us out front for a tour of the cabin. Nice and close to Olympia if you need anything but even on a cold January day, it was difficulty to move ourselves from the picture window and rocking chairs. At one point we were about to head out and an eagle flew past the window and start going after some fish ~50 yards away. Will definitely go back."

It has everything you need inside (just no oven) but it’s not a must. There’s an electric microwave oven and an electric stove so that was perfect. Being RIGHT on the lake is completely surreal, you have a complete view of it from two big windows in the cabin where you can sit in the rocking chairs and just enjoy. Stet also has carriage horses which he lets you feed carrots, pet and interact with if you want to. I can go on & on about this stay—overall it was perfect and I highly recommend this space to anyone looking for a quiet, calm and serene stay by the water with surrounding nature."

We were visiting for a workshop and didn't spend as much time in the cabin as we ultimately would have LOVED to, (we're thinking a week staring at the water next time!), but it was so wonderful to have HOME to come home to! Thoughtful touches abound at this property. Stet and Lynne couldn't be nicer and the view from the rocking chairs was unreal every day and changed every 10 minutes. Comfy bed with plenty of bedding and pillows, great kitchen setup and a pre-set fire. Warm and toasty inside and out. Book it. You won't regret it."

Stet and Lynne are the most gracious of hosts. I felt taken care of in every way from the moment I booked to the moment I left. Everything from the prompt and welcoming communications from Stet, the video tour, the wood stove being stocked and ready for use, the fresh and homemade breakfast selections, to the welcome from Lynne with fresh garden flowers made this a delightful stay in every way.

Stayed over a week","Stet and Lynne’s cabin on Totten is a sweet little get away place where you can surround yourself with the best of the northwest. If you spend time watching the waterfront you will see eagles and osprey and many seabirds feeding. The seals like to come into the bay and you can see the oyster and clam fishery activities. There are many great hikes nearby and we kayaked from Young’s cove nearby and Arcadia point. Stet and Lynne can help you with local info and they are great hosts. The cabin had fresh farm eggs, homemade granola and coffee and was a comfy place to relax. It is close to Olympia for a great farmer’s market, waterfront boardwalk and cute shops and eateries. We also liked walking the Capital campus and lakefront and Priest Point park in Oly."

The deck is warm and inviting with all the flowers and it wraps around the cabin. There’s chairs to sit outside and just watch the wildlife on the water. If you aren’t into sitting outside, there’s two rocking chairs inside facing the oversized windows and the views are just as great. Bed was comfy and sheets were clean and very soft. There’s extra toiletries in the bathroom if you forget something. Only word to the wise is there’s no sink in the bathroom...only the sink in the kitchenette. Didn’t bother me a bit but you never know. Will stay here again if and when I’m back in the Olympia area."

Stets place is well appointed with kitchen essentials so that your basic morning coffee/tea and food needs are covered. This is a very nice touch, so that you can take your time in the morning, rather than realize you have to drive into the market for a forgotten item. Much appreciated.
We picked up some local oysters and cooked them up on the grill, and we got to put our kayaks in twice, at boat launches that were about a 30 minute drive away. Delightful. All in all, the Puget Sound experience we were looking for.
Thank you, Stet!"

My wife and I enjoyed our first anniversary here. We plan to come back, maybe in the summer if it is available.
Thanks to the host! Stet was very hospitable and made our stay an unforgettable one."

Stayed a few nights","I had a fantastic time at the cabin. I was really impressed with how clean and well stocked it was, and the bed linens were so soft. And the view! It is just fabulous. Constantly changing and always beautiful, the Puget Sound really makes itself known in this space. It took my breath away a couple times, between complete zero visibility fog ,to a huge sunny purple and gold sunset, and giant moon over the water, all in a two day visit. Plus all the birds you can see right there from the living room. I went in December and was warm. Also, the host is extremely nice and an interesting person."

Would definitely stay there again!"

Stayed a few nights","Consider yourself lucky if you can reserve this cabin. It is charming and has waterfront views of Puget Sound. Every morning we were able to watch seabirds, and saw a seal one day. Not only is the cabin on the wayee, but it's in the country, and we saw deer every day. All this, and it's only 15 minutes to the middle of town. One star off for the miniscule shower - it really was quite uncomfortable. *Note that the bed is a full size, so if you have more than one large person in it, you'll be cozy! *Also note that cabin has been updated from some previous reviews and now has a small, 2-burner stove top. No regular oven though, just a toast oveb, but that is not an inconvenience."

They even provide you some stuff for breakfast which we found very convenient. The best was the little fire stove, although it wasn't that cold we used it a lot. It added a lot to the atmosphere.
The hosts leave you alone if you want to be alone, if we needed help or had questions they were immediately there to assist or arrange things.
All in all very great experience!"

Aside from the amazing view, the cabin itself has everything for a short or long stay and is well supplied for stove top cooking. It is also surprisingly spacious with ample heat sources including the easy to use wood stove. The location isn't really that far from the highway but it seems like you've found a hidden gem in the middle of nowhere. It's close to many state parks that are easy to get out and enjoy. We had a perfect trip with falling leaves, northwest rain, even snow and a rainbow off the deck, all in the same 2 days. Truly a perfect experience."

The fantastic accommodations included a picture window with a view of the sound in a cabin with a nice kitchen and comfy bed. And the special touches made the stay even more memorable. The cabin was stocked with books on trails and birds... amazing homemade granola, yogurt, and fresh-groun coffee for breakfast, and the surprise of cookies on arrival, great granola and yogurt breakfast. Thank you Stet and Lynne so much for such a nice stay -- I wish I had more time there!"

From the living room the view is stunning and you can perfectly relax after long days. For us it was the base to explore the Olympic national park and the location is pretty convenient since you can access both the east and the west coast of the park.
Lynn and Stet are perfect hosts, the communication was absolutely amazing and they even provided us with food and homemade specialities that were unbelievably tasty.
We would definitely come back and recommend the cabin."

Stayed a few nights","Wow! This place is amazing! The view off the back deck (and view from window) is breathtaking. I can't describe how relaxing it is to sit and take in the view with total silence. Like others have mentioned, it's really quiet -- the only sound you'll hear is an occasional bird. I never thought watching the tide roll in and out throughout the day would be so entertaining. The cabin is well equipped to prepare meals. We enjoyed eating dinner on the deck watching the sunset. The property is quite beautiful with two friendly horses, Tally and Kippy, and lovely gardens full of flowers and vegetables.
Stet and Lynne are the most gracious hosts you'll ever encounter. They'll give you all the privacy you desire however we enjoyed visiting with them and appreciated thier advice on all the great things to do in the area.
This is truly a wonderful place. We can't wait to return!"

Stayed with a pet","I lived here for 3 months during a home remodel. The view out the windows every morning to look through trees at the waters of Budd Bay Inlet was such a peaceful way to start the day; I'm going to miss that. Really comfortable gigantic bed, plenty of room to store clothing and other things I brought from home. The one thing I missed was more kitchen capacity but this is a small space and it was what I expected--a ""heat things up"" space (toaster oven, microwave, gas cooktop, no full oven, smaller refrigerator). Our cat loved looking out a small window in the bedroom to watch birds pecking at the ground below. I bike for transportation and this is a great place to stay if you ride! Easy flat trip to downtown for restaurants, groceries, entertainment, and a beautiful ride the other direction if you want some hills and mileage with a bike lane and then shoulder. Beautiful Squaxin Park is close by with forest trails and access down to the water to watch birds and the occasional seal."

I hike A LOT! So I actually didn't stay in the Airbnb the entire week, as I was camping in Leavenworth and stayed in Seattle for a night. BUT...when I was there, that bed was SO COMFY! It was PERFECT for my rest days, especially after my 22 mile hike to Aasgard Pass)
Things to know if you hike:
-Leavenworth for Colchuck Lake and Aasgard Pass is 4 hr drive from Airbnb
-Mt. Rainier is a 2.5 hr drive from Airbnb (left at 12 am, so this is travel time with no traffic)
-Seattle Airport is about 1.5 to 2.5 hours, depending on Seattle traffic .
-Lastly, Squaxin Park is walkable from Elena's Airbnb. Squaxin Park has ""Telephone of the Wind "" which is why I actually booked this trip. This is where you go to send your loved ones (my daughter, Eliza) who have passed away messages to be carried by the wind..."

Here's why:
The bed is COMFORTABLE
The view is INCREDIBLE
The accommodations are IMMACULATE
And the hosts are WONDERFUL
Notes:
Hubby has had 3 spine surgeries, so when we say ""comfortable"", that means he was able to relax and sleep well.
The couch was also comfy for him.
The accommodations are peaceful and well laid out. There's enough room to work, read, cook & relax. All with a view of the water and sunset.
Literally steps away from the beach.
The hosts went over and above to ensure our comfort.

There’s no full oven (just the toaster oven with no baking trays that fit), and the tv was not working when we arrived. When I messaged about it I got a quick response that the previous guest had the same issue and she had tried to fix it unsuccessfully before we had arrived. She was kind about it and offered to try fixing it again, but we eventually fixed it ourselves a day later. Overall a good quiet place and the issues we ran into were minor and can be improved for next guests."

Stayed a few nights","The apartment was just recently renovated with all new decor and some appliances such as washer and dryer. There was coffee and tea provided and new microwave and fridge also. The bedroom was spacious, and the bed was comfortable. Bathroom is new and was stocked up nicely with soaps, shampoo and clean new towels. The front room is large enough for small dining table and a pull-out sofa bed to sleep an additional 2. The location is perfect for a getaway with partial view of the bay and short driving distance to Olympia historic downtown. The location is very easy to access, huge amount of parking and exceptionally clean everywhere. There is also access to a beach in the bay across the street within a 5 min walk. We watched the sun set over 3 nights. Elena's communication was excellent she welcomed us on the first night and provided many recommendations for local restaurants and places to visit. As with many newly listed and newly renovated places there are some minor issues that Elena addressed immediately upon contact. My wife and I had a beautiful time, and the location is perfect, fantastic restaurants and for a short romantic getaway we would definitely consider returning in the future. Thankyou Elena!"

The unit is next to the carport that is shared with another guest space so can be noisy when another guest is arriving/departing or idling their vehicle.
The unit shares a hot water heater with two other units, so my second morning I waited about an hour for the system to recharge. Not a major issue as I had time to wait."

The location makes all parts of Olympia and Lacey easily accessible.

The space is inviting. Lots of light, but has black-out curtains that allow you to sleep in.
The portable a/c worked perfectly. Kept the space nice and cool.
Love that shampoo, conditioner and body was provided. Shower was nice. Pressure from the showerhead is good. But let me tell you, those TOWELS! We took a picture of the tag so we can buy some for home.
The bed was super comfortable.
We had plenty of room to park our 2 motorcycles in the covered carport.

Please note the area is experiencing some homelessness, but not the hosts fault, and nobody bothered us. There was no use of outside areas. Definitely best to stay and sleep only and not somewhere for a vacation destination (which was fine for us because we were out most the day anyway). Overall it worked great for what we needed!!

Stayed a few nights","The Evergreen Room is nice because it has a treehouse feel. It's part of a house that's built on a slope, so although you enter on the street level, the view out the back is from the second floor. Lots of big trees around the property offer a sense of privacy. The house is located on a street that starts off a little rough from the main road (residences with deferred maintenance, fence graffiti, etc.), but the farther up the street you drive, the nicer the neighborhood gets. The house itself is well-maintained, and we enjoyed our stay. The host emailed us midway thru our visit to offer extra towels, and to ensure we were comfortable.

The floorplan is a bit unusual as the walk-in door enters into the bathroom, which is spacious and includes a closet. There's a sliding door off the other room. The kitchen was well supplied for two. We cooked several meals there and found nothing lacking for simple cooking. The bed is a futon style that can be folded up into a couch. The place is located at the end of a street bordering a greenbelt area, so there was no traffic passing by and the neighborhood was very quiet. We very much enjoyed meeting and interacting with Stephanie and the goats and cats that she obviously loves and takes very good care of. We hope to return soon and will definitely stay here again."

The host was great about adjusting check in time but I found a 5pm check in with a 10 am check out to be pretty rigid considering the price. I was ultimately disappointed with there not being a living area with a separate couch/lounge space. The bed is a futon which is just very uncomfortable. That was the biggest disappointment was paying $180 a night (with fees) to not have a comfortable space to hang out and a comfortable bed. Overall it was clean, good communication, we just couldn’t sleep well on a futon."

She was communicative, flexible, kind, and helpful. The place itself was cozy, clean, and comfortable. The goats are a joy! I have to mention how Stephanie went above and beyond to help me; I had a sprained ankle and my job is a physical one. This meant that I needed lots of rest time between job activities and Stephanie ensured I was able to rest and recover as much as I needed to. She was super easy to get a hold of and always ready to help if needed it.
Also this spot is great. Very close to downtown, as well as parks that are good for walking, running, or hiking.

We really enjoyed getting to know her. She gave us a tour of her beautiful vegetable garden, let us feed catnip to Ozzie the cat, and join a morning hike with Mac and Dutch the goats, which was so much fun! And there is the awwsome four legged welcome committee: Ozzie the cat, Mac and Dutch the goats. We had so much fun hanging out with them. The city of Olympia is a hidden gem, and Stephanie’s place is an oasis surrounded by natural but yet so convenient to get to great restaurants and shops in downtown Olympia. We’ll sure be back on our next trip to Seattle Area."

Stayed a few nights","This cozy studio was everything we could've asked for and more. It was very clean and organized. We felt at home and had everything we needed provided at the studio for our 6 day trip. The studio included hotplates and plenty of dinnerware for nights we didn't feel like going out. The shower was one of my favorite touches; it really made for a relaxing night after a full day of hiking. Stephanie is welcoming, kind, and friendly. She was very easy to talk to and showed some of the best hospitality I have ever experienced. Mac, Dutch, and Ozzie were a real treat! We had a blast walking Mac & Dutch on our last night. It put a smile on my face every morning seeing them before we went on an adventure. The location of this Airbnb was perfect! It was nice and secluded while at the same time being centrally located to many beautiful places. We were about an hour and a half away from Seattle, Mt. Rainier, Ocean Shores, and more. When we were too tired to spend another day hiking, we spent the day in Olympia. It is such a cute city and had a lot of good food choices! The studio is a few minutes away from one of the best pastry shops we have ever had (We had to resist going a third time!) If we ever make it back out to Washington, we would love to stay here again!"

As well if you’re looking to save some money on food she provides a microwave, clean dishes and cups, silverware, a cooking grittle with pans, pots and utensils.

Overall, the studio is in a central great neighborhood location, and possibly too close to Left Bank Pastry, because each day we stopped by the pastry shop for some sweets to enjoy at the studio. In conclusion, I recommend you stay with Mac and Dutch. Relish in hot showers at the studio and indulge in lemon tarts from the pastry shop down the street."

Plus the goats are super cute!"

Stayed with kids","Stephanie was such a gracious host and was very responsive to email inquiries beforehand, and texts during our stay. We chose her place because of the cute goats (absolutely adorable and worth it), and the location (very close to everything we needed in Olympia). I was able to work remotely from my laptop using her reliable WiFi during the day while my family enjoyed the nearby trail and met up with friends. The room was absolutely clean, and the shower water nice and hot. The well stocked kitchenette helped us prep food for the babies and warm up with coffee and tea at any time of day. I recommend staying here - especially if the sound of goats bleating makes you smile."

Stayed about a week","Stephanie runs an ozone cleaner after every guest leaves. She washes every bed linen, including the blankets and the bedspread.
Good stop en route to (or on the way back from) Ruby Beach and Olympic National Park (the south-west sides of the park).
I was working from home during the week. The wireless internet was fast and Stephanie had lots of tea bags, Kashi snacks, and Lara fruit bars in the kitchen that came in handy when I was busy working. The kitchen has a microwave and a small fridge. Firm but comfortable bed for someone who doesn't like futons or lumpy mattresses.
I look back fondly at my stay here. When the air quality in the SFBA, the Portland area, and the Seattle area was horrible (among the worst in the world), Olympia was a rainy spot near the many trees of the Olympic National Park - where the air quality was perfect. A soggy refuge during some traumatizing wildfires."

During low tide there is fun sealife visible right off the back of the boat.

I’m a tiny home enthusiast and noticed the house was well built and easy to manage! I was pleasantly surprised. Sometimes you come across some weird quirky things. It was enjoyable, peaceful, & the people at the marina are so friendly. ((If it any moment you consider selling it, call me first 😅 but I hope ya’ll keep it, it’s such a gem!))
The porch is easily, one of the best features of the home. Some of the sliding glass doors will open so you can still get the breeze and water feel from inside, but still safe for children with the railing. I’ve never seen my kiddo so content! The hosts were prompt & easy to contact for any questions and concerns. Thanks again for such an enjoyable stay!

We arrived late evening and the entrance way was still enticingly lit up, the inside was welcoming and felt like a home.

The ambience is brilliant, even down to the comfortable temperature, inviting scents and dreamy deck. The host is very generous with a check-out time of 12:00pm so we were able to enjoy a little relax in the morning sunshine on the deck. We also enjoyed the opportunity to purchase a wine of our choice from a good little collection. All in all this boathouse is an amazing place and we feel privileged to have stayed."

Stayed one night","When I go on any trip the first question I always ask myself is: ""Is this an experience?"" My aim is always to find the unique, the charming, the downright interesting and fun places/things/experiences.
The House Boat checked that box off completely! Not only is it an absolute odditty I would see on a listicle of unique stays - it was also comfortable, cute, and cozy.
The stay was clean, the balcony I could live on (and practically did playing cards until the sun went down), and Tugboat Annie's was a great restaurant right down the boat ramp.
I would highly recommend this place for any traveller that loves an experience and getting off the beaten path."

Stayed a few nights","Our stay was unsatisfactory for a couple reasons: cleanliness and smell.
The major cleanliness issue was the portable air conditioner, which was sitting in a tub of water full of pink and black bacteria when we arrived. The drain was clogged, so instead of fixing it, the AC was placed in the tub.. The AC unit itself was dirty. Outside tables had food encrusted on them. There were numerous spider webs inside and out housing spiders.
The smell was putrid. There were 8 air fresheners in the small houseboat: 4 in the small bathroom, 3 in the salon and 1 upstairs. The air fresheners added to the smell instead of masking it. This smell was only in the houseboat, the dock smelled fine. I grew up boating in Puget Sound and am familiar with the smell of water and tides, this was the houseboat.
We cleaned the AC tub, opened windows to try to air it out and swept away the webs. We stayed 1 night instead of 2 due to the smell."

The upstairs was on the cool side, but that came with the benefit of some of the soundest sleep I have had in some time. The houseboat is close to downtown Olympia and its numerous coffee shops which made it easy to head there each morning for breakfast. The best feature of the property, by far, was waking up each morning and watching the birds (cormorants, mergansers) diving for their fish breakfast in the water around the boat."

Communication with host and co-host, Chris, were excellent and check-in/out was a breeze. It's about a 5 minute drive to Capital Lake and the down town area - so close to all the things we wanted to do. Having Tugboat Annie's right there was also a plus..We thoroughly enjoyed hanging out on the deck with a glass of wine watching the sites. West Bay Marina is a bit run down, but don't let the initial view upon arrival sway you. The people are all very nice and friendly and it's very quiet at night. We really did enjoy our stay In this lovely boat house."

Stayed one night","Excellent and unique spot for a beautiful Olympia stay. The floating home is truly charming, thoughtfully appointed and set up beautifully to enjoy gorgeous views on its awesome deck.
A couple of things to note: The house is moored at an active marina with relatively few other house boats and a number of live-aboards. It’s neither a top-end marina, nor a dump. Expect very close neighbors (though the house has plenty of curtains and blinds for privacy), and a fair amount of boat traffic. Nothing bad - We very much enjoyed our stay - but worth knowing.
Highly recommended. Great stay!"

Having a great and friendly restaurant and some local boat owners nearby proved handy when needed and added a sense of security to the quiet area. Marian was helpful and very generous.

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I stayed for two days at the houseboat for a fun break for our drive to Seattle. It was definitely a unique experience and fun way to see the Puget Sound and the capital (there’s a great view from the upper deck at high tide). The boat was very accommodating will all supplies you could want or need. The shower surprisingly had great water pressure but as Marian instructed, the showers need to be quick due to the size of the hot water tank. Marian was a wonderful host and had great communication during our stay! We had one issue with the smell of gasoline inside the houseboat and Marian sent his business partner immediately to inspect to ensure everything was in working order. The marina does have some unique smells at low tide. We were able to enjoy dinner right at the marina at Tugboat Annie’s while there and also Anthony’s hearth fire grill which both had wonderful views of the water! We would definitely stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","This place is heaven on the water. It’s a very very cute, modern, and clean house that’s also a boat! Waking up to wildlife was so joyful for us- the bird life was abundant. We loved the deck and seeing the full moon rise over the capital. The bed was cozy and the couch was just paradise! We loved the little electric fireplaces, the unique shower, and the views!
I will be real and say, it’s a boat- you can feel the motion of the tide at times. That wasn’t a problem for us at all- I find myself missing the gentle motion now that I am firmly back on land. Just want folks to be aware as it could be an issue for some…
Also, I rarely say this but one of the best parts about this Airbnb was the host! Marian made us feel so welcome and offered real kindness that made our stay super special. It’s obvious that the hosts love this place and care about making it feel like a retreat.
We can’t say enough good things about this place. Until next time…"

Very nice and cozy place with everything you and the main highlight is the water which youre right on top of which is very soothing and very beautiful view from all of the glass windows and such. Wifi and TV for streaming worked great, all appliances you would need and take full advantage of the beach when the tide goes out in the afternoon.

Regardless of the rainy and cold weather (which we knew was likely in January) we were warm, cozy and comfortable. The cabin is small but very well equipped and smartly arranged- we had everything we needed.
Watching the fog and rain roll through and the tide changing was beautiful. We even lucked out with a perfectly timed break in the clouds our last morning. The sunrise is INCREDIBLE at this little cabin with Mt Rainier visible from bed! Super secluded and private but close enough to town if you want to head out for dinner. We also took the drive up to Hamma Hamma for oysters for the afternoon.
Already planning a return, which I think says it all!"

Stayed with a pet","This place is peaceful, charming, cozy, private and has everything you need. The views are to die for and under rated in descriptions. Even tho the stairs are spoken of and pictured, didnt realize how steep they are. Were in our 70's and active, otherwise I dont think we could have been able to manage them. There are another 10+ stairs to get to the beach. All is workable and the place is pet friendly, but I would think twice with big dogs. Megan is a wonderful host, was easy to reach and stayed in Contact for any questions we had. We enjoyed the visit."

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at Beverly Beach House was one of the very most relaxing times we have ever had, anywhere! The location of this studio cottage is on a beautiful bay of the Puget Sound looking directly across at Mt.Rainier and also down to the State Capital building. The deck juts out over the beach and, when the tide was in, we felt like we were on a ship. We also had the feeling of being in a tree house, with the privacy that the trees provided.
The apartment had everything we needed and was very tastefully appointed. The bed was perfect.
Lazy days and kayaking ( supplied by the host), what could be better!
Also, Megan was very helpful and, though honoring our privacy, was very responsive to our usual kinds of requests. I enjoyed our satisfying conversations.
We WILL be back!!!!!!!!"

Felt a deep sense of tranquility, wonderful scenic views from waking up in the morning and reading on the deck! So much wildlife passing through, loved seeing the seals poke their heads out of the water!
Just a few minor maintenance issues but Meagan was very quick to respond and addressed the situations.
And as the description says there are a lot of stairs! Very steep and big incline. I’m in ok shape but the stairs reminded me I need to keep working out. Haha!

I think I recall the listing stating that there are steps to get to and from the cabin and there is a picture showing those steps, but make sure you are comfortable with LOTS of stairs because if you have bad knees, the steps will take its toll, especially with luggage. That being said, even with my less than perfect knees, I would stay again. Such a unique place :-)"

Also for exploring travelers: we stayed for 3 days. Seattle was only an hour drive. Mount Rainer a two hour drive.

The private beach was great for taking walks along the water's edge. The path down to the cottage is so pretty with all the lights.

But, it was more than enough and comfortable to come home to shower, enjoy the sunset and moonrise over the water from the porch, and rest after long days! Meagan was very communicative when needed and accessible. We happened to travel during record breaking heat-she and her husband did what they could to keep us cool. We would recommend and stay again!

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I enjoyed a three night visit which did not disappoint in this cozy little cabin on the bay. It was January and the weather was a little too cold to just sit on the deck, so I really appreciated the wall-to-wall windows for enjoying the spectacular views! The little cast iron fireplace provided the perfect ambiance in the evenings. The cabin decor is stylish and the bed/bedding is very comfortable. The full-size bath tub was sparkling clean and nice to relax in. My husband appreciated the tall, wide shower head, (which is sometimes an issue for him when we travel). Our hosts went above and beyond by promptly assisting us with a dead car battery on our first day there. I’ve never had a host answer messages so quickly, also offering lots of suggestions for places to visit in the area. We enjoyed the local Bayview Thriftway store for our groceries. But those views though! I had many of my Facebook friends ask me for the listing just based on the pictures I was posting. It’s rare to feel like you’re literally staying right above the water with the sound of the waves! 🌊"

The space is small, but perfect for making small meals and enjoying each others company. We enjoyed our stay and will be back if our travels ever take us near the area again. Thank you Meagan!"

Stayed a few nights","World class views at moderate hotel room prices! I had to book this trip at the last minute due to unforeseen family events and I couldn't have found a better deal. In the same price range as hotel rooms in Olympia, the Beverly Beach House provided a quaint and private experience with the aforementioned views just 15 minutes away from downtown. Meagan was attentive but not obtrusive and her flexibility and understanding allowed me and my visiting family to connect and enjoy our time together. Your neighbors include plenty of deer and the occasional seal swimming on past while you get to take in amazing views of Mt Rainier over Budd Bay. If you're looking for a quiet oasis from the traffic and noise, this is the perfect place for you. Thank you Meagan!

It was a great place for relaxation for me and my wife -- very peaceful and refreshing. There are many beautiful parks with wildlife around the area for hiking. Our wonderful host, Meagan, was very responsive to our needs and very quick to answer our questions. The studio is very clean and the kitchen is well stocked for cooking. We liked the wall-to-wall windows along the water view and deck. This place is highly recommended!"

The pictures do not do any justice! Growing up in Washington and now living in California this place almost makes me want to come back home! The view and the water and on the final day of our stay Mt. Rainier showed herself. It had been snowing and raining the days before. Do not pass this little gem up! Meagan thank you again. Btw. I never got to read what my girlfriend wrote in the book. But she did take a picture of it. So maybe one day I’ll know

We enjoyed walking the waters edge with our dog while the tide was out and sitting on the porch listening to the water as it hit the barrier wall below us when the water was in. Mount Ranier greeted us in all her glory when we arrived. The mornings were foggy but brought another level of serenity to this special place. Highly recommend it if you want peace and quiet. Olympia is a short drive and we headed over to the farmers market for some fresh steelhead and oysters. Meaghan our host greeted us with some lovely local wine! We will definitely come back again.

The beach is very walk-able and if you kayak there are many enjoyable areas to see launching right from the cabin. Lots of bird life on the shore with the occasional seal swimming by :)
The town of Olympia is a close drive to stock up on what you need during your stay. Don't miss the great Farmers Market downtown!"

It was our second time here, and I didn't know how it could have been better than our first visit, but it was! We had been in December, and even though it was cold outside we had the amazing fireplace going to heat us up. This time, the weather was perfect to have the double doors open with the fresh air rolling in. Honestly I don't think we've ever stayed anywhere that was more conducive to unplugging, relaxing, and just spending quality time together. I HIGHLY recommend Beverly Beach House! Bring a book, a bottle of wine (or enjoy the fantastic wine that Meagan has waiting) and unwind. We will absolutely be back!"

We walked along the beach and met some nice people who had just purchased a home down the way. It's a quiet, friendly area. We would go back for sure. Thank you, Meagan!"

From the super warm down comforter on the bed, to the awesome espresso machine (I'm desperately going to miss). Meagan was great, and happily accommodated our requests to make sure we were comfortable. The view is absolutely incredible. Even though it rained most of the time we were there, we barely noticed. We just cranked up the fireplace next to the bed and sat out on the balcony. We were even lucky enough to be there on the weekend they had a Christmas boat parade! This is truly a gem, and we will most definitely be coming back!"

Stayed a few nights","This property was wonderfully tucked in to the trees of this peninsula and then opened up just enough along the beach to place this perfect sized small cabin-like home. The driveway is one of a kind and beautiful - only to be matched by the long walkway of 35 ivy covered steps to the doorway of this clean and comfortable small, one room cabin. The cabin is made up of one comfortable queen size bed in the center of the room but it is surrounded by a small dining table in the picturesque windows over the bay, a modern kitchenette, and an electric wood stove for chilly nights! The full bath is clean and stocked with essentials! I loved finding a bottle of local wine on the table with two wine glasses ready for visitors to enjoy and relax. Venture out onto the patio and enjoy the bay views including wildlife and sailboats and evening city lights. A magnificent find for a quiet calm weekend or vacation getaway! Perfectly set above the water and the sound can lull you to sleep! Loved this location and plan to visit again!"

We enjoyed taking the kayaks out on the calm waters, picking blackberries along the beach, reading and relaxing on the deck and watching the tide come in and out.

Stayed a few nights","The Bungalow is simply sensibly set up. I stayed there several times for multiple reasons - it has a room that can serve as a separate bedroom for my kid, while I have the master bedroom. It has a well-equipped kitchen with everything you need to cook - there's not just a full gas stove, but a toaster, a toaster oven, etc. You can supply yourself here if you want that. There's a spacious shower that works well. There's air conditioning to keep the place cool, a gas oven to keep it warm if needed - fit for all seasons. Washer and drier - this can be a real home base away from home.
The place is also nice, with opportunities to sit outside, shielded by apple trees and bamboo from the street - and it's not a busy street. And yet you can walk on foot to downtown Olympia or uphill to shop -it's a nice neighborhood, we walked it many times.
Ellen herself has always been responsive on short notice when we needed something, a friendly host that respects your time there."

Stayed with kids",Ellen's bungalow was a treasure to find! The unique architectural features and comfortable space were just what we were looking for. I was able to get my toddler setup in the twin room just fine and he slept great! The outside patio area was perfect for socializing with family after the little one was asleep. We were able to walk downtown no problem and took the free bus back when we didn't feel like walking. Will absolutely be staying here again.

Stayed one night","The location of this place is good for our needs. It utilizes green cleaning products and practices, which we admire. Two of us stayed here, and while I would stay again under certain circumstances now that I have seen the place, my family member would not. To be fair, I got the main bedroom with the luxury mattress, pillows, and linens. The main bed was extremely tall, and the ceiling was extremely low. I am 5'4"" and had to jump/climb into bed, and I was able to touch the ceiling while standing on floor. I think low ceilings make me uncomfortable. I also felt really squeezed in while using the toilet. I did appreciate the lack of fragranced products in the space, as they cause headaches.
My family member got the uncomfortable twin bed in a cramped room which was missing window coverings on half of the windows, including the mostly-glass (frosted) door to the outside. They were counting on the room-darkening shades listed on the ad, and had a hard time sleeping in that room. They also thought the place smelled weird, which I had to agree with. Apparently raw douglas fir wood can give off that weird smell. Unfortunately, the smell, which was reminiscent of urine, was strongest in the small bathroom. There were two fans available for use, which helped them to sleep a little.
Kitchen and dining area had all you would need. It was stocked with beautiful dishware. It was a twist and squeeze to get into the fridge/pantry area. The bar stools did not seem to match the countertop height they were set to, unless you were a small child. The living area and library had built-in seats, made more comfy by many nice pillows.
The tiny AC unit, located in the farthest corner from the bedrooms, seemed like it would be a struggle on a very hot day. We arrived later and eventually made use of the cooler outside air.
The outdoor garden had several areas to sit and relax, with beautiful plants all around. The neighborhood was nice to take a stroll after dinner. It was a quiet residential area and we felt safe staying there.
This place is generally recommended unless you are tall or wide, or have a very sensitive sense of smell."

Stayed one night","The bungalow is a fantastic retreat! We ended up needing to extend our stay by 1 night (thankfully it was available) so this is my second review for the bungalow.
If you see this one first, I will tell you that this place is even cozier than the pictures show! We had everything we needed on our stay and felt so relaxed just walking through the door."

Stayed a few nights","Ellen's bungalow is just wonderful! My husband kept saying that he felt transported to serenity being there and I can't agree more.
The bungalow was clean, had every amenity we needed on our work trip, and felt like we had a lot more space than the square footage listed. I only wish we would have spent more time there instead of working, but we would definitely stay there again if we're in the area again."

Stayed one night","The Bungalow is a lovely little space, beautifully decorated and appointed with the feel of a quiet cabin, but in the heart of the city with a wonderful view of the State Capitol from the deck. A big comfortable bed, an upscale kitchen and bathroom and several places to lounge, eat and enjoy a glass of wine. Comfort, coziness and warmth are just a few words that describe this vacation get-away. Perfect place for that first, relaxing, morning cup of coffee and a book..."

Kitchen, bathroom and beds were all great and just what we needed. We wished we stayed another night!"

Stayed one night","Very cozy and rustic, like a cabin in the city. The twin bed was comfortable, but you should know a taller person might not be so comfortable in it. Seems like a perfect place if you wanted to do a lot of cooking. Easy to get to the historic downtown, easy on street parking. Several steps to get up to the house. There's no TV but the wifi worked fine for our needs."

The gas heat stove in the living room was wonderful. And the privacy all around the bungalow was terrific! Loved the tall bamboo that surrounds the front patio. Perfect place for a glass of wine. Great little place for a couple."

It was in a great location and close to downtown with a resident kitty which we name Lily. If we were to ever visit again we would definitely try and stay at either of Ellen's properties.

Stayed about a week","Stayed for eight nights in the Bungalow. It is shielded from the street, shielded from view by fruit trees. So much so the Uber Eats driver missed it twice!
Everything is as listed. A wall mounted AC unit keeps the main space cool, a gas heated fireplace gets it warm in no time. Kitchen stove works by gas, too, so does hot water.
There's a spacious shower, much appreciated. Two areas near the entrance have garden furniture to enjoy sitting outside. The home has been decorated with art and feels cozy and a bit quirky due to the many corners and storage areas, likely added over time.
As stated in the listing: no TV. Wifi works like a champ, though. You can wash and dry your own laundry on the premises, just coordinate with the host.
Speaking of host, Ellen was always quick to respond and helpful. She stocks the home well in toiletries, towels, cleaning and laundry supplies, better than other hosts.
As for noise, the street is rather quiet. If you keep the window open in the bedroom, there's some noise, maybe the AC unit in the other house on site next to it?
Area is in ready walking distance to downtown - five minutes - yet feels removed. Easy to walk to a grocery store in ten minutes. Free street parking, not overly busy.
It's good value for money overall, a great location, combining convenience with being less busy, good host, and good amenities."

However, the the plant life in front of the house it does feel more private. I think with a little more tlc it will be even better."

The comfortable cabin like feel met all our needs when we needed a break from people. It provided a great little retreat while still being close to shopping and restaurants. It also had a couple of nice small patios that we used when family stopped by for a visit. Thanks again for the use of your property!
