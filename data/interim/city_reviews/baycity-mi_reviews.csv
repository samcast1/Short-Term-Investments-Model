Group trip","We rented this house for our wedding party the weekend of our wedding. I was so excited for the large backyard and enough bedrooms to fit all of my needs. When we arrived on site I was disappointed to see that the backyard was not large at all and did not have the fire pit that was in the photos. The house inside ended up fitting our needs, but was still not what we expected. The house is a historic home so the layout is kinda weird. The bedroom with the futons is connected to another bedroom where they have to go through it to go to the upstairs bathroom. The doors also did not lock and the king sized bedroom had a glass door that connected to the dining room with the curtain being broken so people could see into it. Also would not recommend this space for ADA accessibility if that is what you’re looking for. In addition, the hot tub only fit 5 comfortably even though the house was for a large group and make sure to read the description on parking so you know what you’re getting into."

Stayed with kids","We enjoyed St. Patrick's Day weekend in Bay City! Instead of staying at a hotel we chose Jason's Airbnb and we were delighted with our decision. We liked the house and felt it suited our group really well. We enjoyed hanging out at the dining room table and in the TV room all together. The kiddos loved having their own space in the futon bedroom and it was nice that all of the adults had comfortable beds. We were just a block away from the parade so that made it really easy! We felt the neighborhood was quiet and safe, as well. All in all, we had a great stay and look forward to returning next year!"

Group trip","The house was big enough for our group of 7 with room to spare. There were plenty of towels and dinnerware - these don't feel like big things but we've stayed in Airbnb's that were short on both of these and when you don't have enough of either, you do notice. The house was very close to a couple restaurants, a pub, a liquor store and an ice cream parlor, and very close to downtown Bay City. We had to ask Jason a few questions and he was very quick to respond. Definitely was a great experience overall."

We stayed for three nights but had originally booked two; there was a snowstorm coming and we lucked out and it was available! I cannot say thank you enough to the hosts for ensuring the house was ready early and for making our holiday so much easier! We had almost everything we needed to make meals at the house with plenty of dishes and kitchen items. It was a big home but warm and cozy for an old home, well updated but keeping the original charm throughout, and very charming modern decor."

If you’re looking for a spot in Bay City close enough for a fun weekend but still getting ample amounts of peace and quiet. I highly recommend you check out this home."

Comfortable , very roomy, very orderly, clean & well organized. Nice snacks for us on the counter & Keurig ready to go. Stick of butter in fridge - nice.
I enjoyed morning coffee on the enclosed back porch looking out at the large back yard, which was very inviting with its white fabric shade canopies. Obviously, Marylynn has put a lot of work into this lovely home."

Nice little touches like robes, shampoo, coffee, a book with menus & games to play. Very comfy beds also with nice linens. Felt very safe & was in a nice neighborhood close to a big park. Just happened to be close to my moms childhood home, so she loved that.
It was great since we needed 2 rooms, but didn’t want my mom to be alone in a hotel room.
My elderly mom had never stayed at a AIRBNB & was a little nervous about it even though I had done my research. She’s raved & told everyone about how nice it was!"

Tonya has thought of so many things that a guest could need, even before they know they need it. When we first arrived, we were hungry after driving and snacks were provided. That is an example of the thoughtfulness of our hosts. The Welcome Book that was provided gave us a few options of local restaurants. We did a carry out order from the Castaways Restaurant. The food was very good and the prices were reasonable. We have never stayed on the water before, so this was a treat.

It is also conveniently located close to downtown bay city with plenty of bars and restaurants to enjoy! We took a short drive to Bay City State Park to see the bay as well.

Stayed a few nights","The place was nice, clean and comfortable. Great neighborhood. They had a camera free monitoring system, and every time moved it lit up. Laugh to hard, it lit up. We felt like we were being watched 24/7 like children. It gave us a VERY uneasy feeling the whole time. Airb&b always have you wondering about hidden cameras and microphones etc, since you hear about people’s experiences often. This didn’t help. So, if you don’t like a feeling of being monitored, I would chose a different listing."

As in the description, there are two floors of steps (42 steps) so don’t bring big luggage. The kitchen has just what you need to make your own meals. Bottle water & cokes left in fridge were an added treat. The only strange thing we found interesting was that the bedroom door does not close due to the bed being the size it is. But the bed is very comfortable. The host is extremely responsive and kind. The value of this Airbnb is fantastic."

The hosts even had water bottles (& cans of coke) in the fridge, which we appreciated. The only thing missing in the kitchen was something to use in the oven, like a cookie sheet or a dish. It was a great place to stay, don't let the stairways or hallways deter you, those may be out-dated, but the apartment itself is very nice!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a perfect place to stay if you really want to feel part of the closely knit community that is Bay City.The house is a perfect example of the big, historic homes of Bay City's central neighborhoods.You're a really short drive from downtown, the river, bars and the bridges if you want to get to the west side.This place is also perfect if you have a ton of people who need to share the same space.The 5 bedrooms upstairs gave everyone their own private space and the mattresses and bedding were extremely comfortable!Truly! If you're someone who struggles to sleep in a bed that's not yours, you'll be fine.There's a TV in every room if watching shows at night is how you get to sleep. Plenty of drawer/closet space to move right in like you live there. The kitchen has everything you need, which you know is not always the case with AirBnB. Plenty of knives, utensils, dishes.A week's worth of coffee provided!Parking for 4, hot tub, finished basement,mega dining room.Like living in Bay City"

The kitchen and open floor plan make the house feel so big. The neighbors were quiet, as well as the neighborhood. You are 30 minutes from so many things, so figuring out what to do isn't going to be an issue. There were more than enough linens in the bathroom for our stay. The decor makes you feel right at home and the beds are SO comfy.
And Jessica? Jessica was awesome! She touched base before our visit to ask what snacks we would like, and stayed in touch to provide ideas of places to visit. She helped us find some great restaurants and provided us some great advice on the area. She is a gem!
You can't beat the value of this place. We have already told our couple friends about our trip and we can't wait to visit again. This will be our go-to for a while."

Group trip","We loved staying at Shirley's Temple and Jessica was a most accommodating host. You could tell that the house was clean from the moment you entered and everything that we needed (that travelers can't really bring with them) was provided. We enjoyed the outside as much as we did the inside. The bathroom is a little small for a group of 6 but Jessica thoughtfully brought over robes for everyone - such a nice touch!! Kitchen was perfectly stocked, and it was obvious that the linens throughout the house were chosen for her guest's comfort. The furniture was as comfy as it was attractive and so well suited for the house. And what can more I say about LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION - as convenient to everything as it was fabulous to enjoy. We spent most of our time out on the deck taking in the amazing views and breathtaking sunsets. Thanks so much Jessica, we really hope to come back again next year!"

Jessica’s home is spacious with amazing views of the river and the bay from the living room window wall. The place is very clean, tastefully decorated and the kitchen is large with everything you need. A blender is the only thing I would add. Bedrooms are fine, the only drawback is one nice but compact bathroom. Just plan to get dressed elsewhere. We loved the outdoor space, especially screened in gazebo! It was great to sit outside without having to deal with any bugs!!! Whether from the side of the house sitting/eating area to the riverfront walk out deck from the living room or the gazebo, it felt so tranquil and relaxing, perfect for our family. We’d definitely come back!"

The place was very clean, fresh and cute! We had our thanksgiving there and the kitchen was perfect for our needs! Great big island and nice big table for us to eat! We traveled a short distance to Frakenmuth and spent the weekend shopping and riding horse and carriage rides. One of our best trips we have ever done! Booking for next year!"

This location is right by downtown Bay City, which was absolutely perfect for going out. Our stay was everything we were wanting, and we hope to book again soon! It was clear that our host is an absolute professional, and we appreciated the clear communication, and extremely clean stay!"

Stayed a few nights","Shirley's Temple is a serene and tranquil oasis in MI. My vacation staying at Shirley's Temple was one of the most relaxing vacations ever! The first thing you notice walking into the living area is the amazing views of the Kawkawlin River flowing out into the bay. There is so much room in the living room and kitchen. The gazebo and the deck were the favorite hang out places for my friend and I. The kitchen is fully stocked with all the kitchenware you may need to cook a meal. The bedrooms were comfortable and the mattresses were great as well - I normally sleep on a Tempur-pedic mattress and for me to say another mattress is great says a lot. There is only one small drawback - the bathroom has VERY limited space to get dressed after your shower. I would recommend (if you're fluffy like me) to bring a robe so that you can walk through the house to your room to get dressed. I would stay in Shirley's Temple again and again, one of the best places I've rented!!! 10/10 would recommend!!!"

The smaller bedroom is perfect for younger kids to share. The property is located at the mouth of the Kawkawlin River and was perfect for our 22' foot boat and opens directly to Saginaw Bay. Chris was super helpful as we needed extra fenders and loaned us a spare set to help us during our stay. Jessica is extremely responsive to anything you may need or have questions about. Highly recommend staying here. The bathroom is a bit on the smaller side but had everything we needed and for a family of 4 was very accommodating.

I had a few questions/requests for Jason prior to arriving and he responded almost instantaneously.

We had ample space for our small family and there was enough space for a few aunts and uncles to join us for some socializing in the living room one afternoon. Jason was responsive to any questions or requests before and during our stay. We would absolutely stay at this apartment again the next time we're in Bay City!"

The unit had a pleasant environment, well stocked with games which we played on the large dining room table. The beds were very comfortable and there was an abundance of clean towels and TP. An additional lavatory was an asset given the fact that five of us were there during the day and four of us stayed the night.
An off-street parking space and rear entrance were very convenient."

There was an problem with the keypad at the entrance (batteries were dead), but after a call to Jason, it was quickly remedied.
The kitchen is well stocked with anything you may need if you want to prepare a meal instead of eating out.
The bathroom had extra supplies of bath washes, shampoos, lotions, etc. The only issue we ran into in the bathroom was there were only towels/washcloths for three people, and we had four, but we made due with what we had.
The location is close to many shops, the USS Edson, and Frankenmuth is a quick drive away.

this place to anyone visiting Bay City/Frankenmuth, and we look forward to our third stay!"

The area is quaint and has a lot of charm…it’s not pristine by any stretch, but it’s comfortable. It felt safe walking in the neighborhood and downtown areas all day, and even after the sun was down after our dinner out. There are some cute boutiques and cafe’s worth exploring. The best part of our stay was running into several people in town who were friendly, probably because Jason allowed us to bring our Great Pyrenees along, and he’s a celebrity everywhere we go! Our teens chose to stay in for a movie night in the large living room with that HUGE TV. The entire space beckons you to linger, and take in every detail of the architecture that surrounds you in this massive period home. Charlene, the home’s caretaker, is a gem!"

Being an older home, there are a few things that older adults wanting to rent it might want to consider. There were some stairs at both entrances to navigate, and the lighting, due to the high ceilings, was not very bright. The apartment was very clean and the beds very comfortable.

Stayed with a pet","I was disappointed with how our reservation started but would consider trying this space again due to Jason's responsiveness & the size of the space. I checked well after the 3 PM check in to find that the space was not cleaned (i.e. beds unmade, dirty towels on racks, wrong name on welcome board). A call to Jason started the remedy quickly. However, instead of immediately making it right, the cleaners gave us attitude, questioning whether it was left in that condition or if we made the mess. After they left,I wondered if we truly got the level of cleaning we would have gotten if it wasn't a rushed, last-minute job. In the past, hosts have offered discounts for inconveniences that disrupt. This time felt more severe since I had a 3-month-old with me but no such offer came from Jason.
Jason did help us get a better level of cool during our stay as well, which slightly lifted the cloud from the cleaning incident. I love the clear communication. Wish the stay matched the reviews more :-("

The apartment was spotless, the beds were very comfortable, and the kitchen had anything we needed. We really enjoyed the HUGE television, too!
We had a little problem with the smart lock on the apartment door (it took us a few times to unlock it EVERY time, even after reading the directions sent to us!).
Other than that, our stay was perfection!
We will DEFINITELY be back!!!"

Huge TV — didn’t need my glasses it was so big. It was toasty warm when the weather turned cold. Great water pressure in the shower and plenty of hot water. The decor and furnishings were apropos for this Victorian mansion. Though we didn’t use it, the kitchen was well stocked with condiments, dishware and first-rate appliances. It met our needs very well."

Stayed a few nights","An excellent apartment – very comfortable, well-furnished, very well-equipped, and in a great location. My wife and I, after spending a few very enjoyable days in Bay City in January, decided to return in October for another short break. We wanted to stay on or near Center Avenue, in the fascinating historic district, where there is an astonishing range of styles for the big houses and public buildings that Bay City’s confident lumber barons and industrialists built during the city’s boom years in the late nineteenth and very early twentieth centuries. As the Center Avenue Neighborhood Association (which produces an excellent walking-tour brochure) puts it: “Among our district’s 880 historic structures are examples of various architectural styles, including Arts & Crafts, Colonial Revival, Georgian Revival, Gothic Revival, Greek Revival, Italianate, Mid-Century Modern, Neo-Classical, Queen Anne, Richardsonian Romanesque, Second Empire, Shingle Style, Stick, and Tudor Revival, as well as kit homes by the Aladdin, Lewis, and Liberty companies.” This ground-floor apartment, running the length of a massive mock-Tudor house, was an excellent choice for us. It is one of two ground-floor AirBnB rentals; the upper floors of the house are divided into regular rental apartments. The elegant sitting room at the front of our apartment, with a lovely bay window, the large bedroom (one of two) with the four-poster bed in the middle, the dining room and spacious, well-equipped kitchen at the back were all perfect for us. Two parking spaces off the side road, one covered, were conveniently close to the back door, making unloading and loading easy. The apartment was spotlessly clean. In the kitchen we found everything we needed, except for a kettle and a teapot (but, as traveling tea-drinkers, we are used to having to bring our own supplies), and we enjoyed frothing our milk for the occasional coffee in the Keurig machine, among an array of excellent kitchen appliances, including a refrigerator with an ice-maker, a rarity, at least in my experience, in AirBnBs. We slept well on the very comfortable, king-sized mattress, despite a little traffic noise. The sitting room boasts an enormous TV screen, so that, although we don’t usually watch TV when we travel, this time we could not resist an hour of Netflix and some Premier League highlights (there is a good range of subscription services). WiFi was excellent and abundant power outlets made it easy to charge phones, laptops, camera batteries, etc, in every room; the USB ports in the bedside lamps on either side of the bed were particularly welcome. All the doors are secured with digital locks. Outside, a few minutes walk will take you past an extraordinary and eclectic range of buildings. We also used the apartment as a base for visits to the Dow Gardens and the Alden B. Dow house in Midland (both very well worth the short drive), to the Tobico Marsh nature trail on the shores of Lake Huron, and the Bay City historical museum – both excellent. Drinks at the Public House bar and its sister Harless and Hugh Coffee shop, and dinner at The Real Seafood Company, in an elegant, modern building on the riverfront, were all very enjoyable, as was lunch in Midland at Café Zinc in the elegant H Hotel. Midland’s Wednesday Farmers Market was surprisingly lively for late October. Our breakfasts and dinners at the apartment were a pleasure to prepare and to consume at the large dining table (which would comfortably seat six). There is a coin-operated washing machine in the basement, but we did not use it. We would happily return to this apartment and recommend it wholeheartedly."

Lots of blankets for the beds and living room to cuddle with, which was fantastic. Sofa bed needs extra padding or something but the couch was comfy. The living room has the largest TV ever on the wall, which was great for our movie night, almost felt like we were at the theater. The space is set up shotgun style we had lots of space for the 5 of us. Loved the kitchen, great new appliances. Great location for all the traveling we did, lots of shopping and food options nearby. Good value, would definitely stay again if going to be in the area."

I also noticed (by reading through the guestbook) that a lot of other guests are repeated customers of this AirBNb, and I gotta say after staying here I see why. I love that they thought about the needs of their guests, and I do appreciate that the place is kept up so well and it is very clean.
My boyfriend and I rented some ‘Bird’ scooters that were found in the parking lot right next to the AirBNB and drove them around to see all the historic houses. The location is so beautiful that even that felt like an amazing experience. I stay at AirBNB’s across the entire USA as I travel for work frequently and this is one I am adding to my list as one of my favorite that I have to re-visit for vacation! Definitely recommend!

Stayed with kids","Wow. This home was spectacular. It was not only historically beautiful but it felt like home. There was everything you could possibly need from an extra toothbrush to board games. The beds were extremely comfortable and the living room was perfect for our family to spend our vacation together. We cooked meals, ate at the large dining room table and snuggled in the living room and watched movies and played games. We will absolutely stay here again while in Bay City. My only complaint is that the thermostat was locked and set on a daily cycle. One day it was very hot and I wasn’t able to turn down the heat and the next day it was extremely windy and you could feel the draft through the windows. It could have been user error, but I wasn’t able to make any adjustments. The front door to the apartment also did not always unlock with the code but the back door which was closer to the assigned parking spot worked every time. We made unforgettable memories here and enjoyed every second of our stay."

If you are traveling through Michigan and happen to be staying in the Bay City area, do yourself a favor and stay here; you will not be disappointed. From the time you enter the Weber apartments (recently renovated) and make your way to apartment 1W, you'll immediately take notice of the very spacious and plush living room, with its ornate bay window. This apartment has all of the modern features we've come to expect in the 21st century, and yet still retains much of its early 20th century charm. You'll truly feel like a man-about-town here, especially being so close to Downtown Bay City. There are many pots, pans and dishes. A drip coffee maker and a Keurig are available. It would appear as though there wasn't a single utensil that one would be deprived of. The bathrooms were clean and well-appointed. The main bathroom had just about several different types of shampoo and soap available, and stocked with clean towels and linens. It would appear that everything about this apartment is designed to give the guests a fantastic urban experience that will keep them coming back for more. Surely, I shall be counted among them, no doubt."

Stayed one night","Amazing flat. The pictures don't do this beautifully restored flat justice. The interior design is flawless. The kitchen is better appointed than my own at home.
I dropped this from a 5 star review for the following reasons:
* The house is on a busy street. There is a lot of street noise starting at around 7:00AM. Night time was quiet.
* Not one window in the flat could be opened. All were painted shut. We always enjoy fresh air in our home and this was annoying.
* The covered parking space had a hug hole in the roof that was right above the roof of our car. As it was raining when we were there, we got less wet keeping the car out of the parking space.
I would still highly recommend staying here."

We also enjoyed very comfortable furniture, well stocked kitchen, and a great location within walking or stroller distance from town. We especially enjoyed the toys and cups/plates for kids!!
We cooked and had family meals in the charming dining room and had plenty of space to play blocks in the sun filled living room.
This was a very enjoyable stay- highly recommend especially for families !!"

Did some walks through the neighborhood around the home, which was nice. Covered parking was nice. Also was perfect since it was pet friendly so we got to bring our dog. One outdoor patio restaurant even let her sit with us outside while we ate. Very roomy for an appointment and can accommodate a group."

It was located only about 1.5 hours from where we live, but it felt like we were in Northern Michigan, quiet and serene. The home had all the amenities we could ask for, and we didn’t need much of anything for our stay. Check-out was a breeze, very little to do. This would be a fantastic location in the summer, too, with lots of yard leading right to the bay. A state park is within 2 mins walking distance from the home, or a short drive, eh oh we took advantage of using in the sunny weather. Krysti was responsive, friendly and helpful. We’ll look to book this home again for future trips!"

My only small negative was, We could easily hear converstions of people walking down the sidewalk, cars that drive by or had music playing and the garbage truck bright and early one
Morning. But these are things out of the hosts control so we dont hold it against the rental. Just something to note if you go during busy season and are a light sleeper or are not used to city life. We barely heard any noise from the coffee shop below, outside of an event that was hosted one night, which got quite loud, But the guests left by 10p so it didnt bother us too much. The Public House is a must for brunch! All in all we enjoy this cute cozy place."

Stayed a few nights","I recently rented this Airbnb for a wedding along with the downstairs coffee shop: Harless and Hugh which served as the wedding reception venue. This Airbnb was PERFECT for the bride and groom. It also served as the location for the bride and bridesmaids to prepare for the wedding. We spoke so highly of this space that everyone at the reception downstairs wanted to come up and take a peek! The layout is perfect with a huge romantic bedroom and bathroom. The kitchen is seems functional: we mainly used it as a bar for drinks since we didn’t cook any meals. Location for us was stellar as this Airbnb is in downtown Bay City close to bars, adorable shops, Antique Center, courthouse, riverfront, Princess Wenonah, Planetarium, hotels where other wedding guests stayed, Third Street Light Bridge, art galleries, etc. This Airbnb also includes a private rooftop terrace surrounded by ivy making it very private. It was perfect to overlook downtown.
Interior: so well-decorated, clean&Awesome!"

Great shower pressure and delightful bathtub. Highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","PROS:
As pictured
Walkable
CONS:
Lacked functionality for a longer stay - no dresser for clothing, no counter space in bathroom, lacked adequate lighting in the bathroom, and no hook for a hand towel near the sink in the bathroom
When we experienced issues with our accommodations the host wasn’t very hospitable or empathetic. They seemed offended that we experienced an issue, rather than being empathetic to our situation. We ended up staying in a hotel for the final 3 days of our stay."

Stayed one night","We loved our stay here. The place was exactly as pictured on Airbnb and it was more spacious than we anticipated. We spent an evening on the rooftop patio. It was super cozy and private. Really enjoyed the fireplace on the patio. Loved that we were right above their cafe. Delicious cappuccino and pastries/toast. The staff and the host were super friendly and helpful. It was our first time to Bay City so we really weren’t sure what to expect. We came Memorial weekend and, surprisingly, a lot of places downtown were closed. There was a huge antique store and some small shops open. We were just wanting a quiet night away (with good coffee nearby) and this place was definitely that. We would come again for sure!"

Stayed a few nights","Beautifully curated “zen den” for my solo retreat. From the steel tongue drum in the bedroom to the salts and candle in the bathroom this spot made for a perfect experience. I enjoyed the downtown location with meals, shopping and other attractions (check out the planetarium!) within walking distance. A day of perusing the many shops followed by a long soak in the tub and then sitting by the fire really made my stay complete. Some of the noise in town could be distracting at times (loud horns from a train or boat) but I brought earplugs and used those. The bed was firmer than I care for but some may appreciate that. The large reading nook was very cozy! The stocked “mini-bar” and fridge (add-on costs) were a pleasant surprise."

Our only reason for not giving 5 stars is that it seemed to be missing a few amenities that we are used to having in AirBnbs. ( Especially in this price point) We would’ve loved to have more bathroom amenities - body wash, face wash, bubble bath, etc. Additionally, we could have used some hand soap in the kitchen along with a full length mirror somewhere, and bath mats. We are all about minimalism as well but would’ve loved those extra few touches throughout to really make our stay. Over all, however, a beautiful space and we hope to stay with them again some day at another of their beautiful properties."

Easy walk to really anything we wanted to do. Our timing was just right because we got see the Alabama tribute band (boys in the band) at the Ampitheater which was also fantastic.....and free! Walked around the river walk. Got to see the Spanish tall ship that was in the harbor so that was a plus. Cool places to eat and shop. The roof top sitting area was a nice way to relax at night. Just close enough to a hear a DJ at one of the outside bars and enjoy some music to wind the evening down. Would stay again if we are ever back in the area.

Stayed a few nights","What a great experience that was.. The space it’s self is spacious, bright, quite and cozy. Extensive mini bar options with affordable prices and the easiest way to pay the bartender. The living vines covering the window, the warm fireplace after a nice bath or watch the stars and listen to the city with a bbq and fire pit on the patio. It all made the experience so great. It is less than 3 min walk to everything from Saginaw River, amphitheater, DC Planetarium, dispensaries, food and more. If you want to cross the river just rent a electric scooter, the extra money is worth it in the elements and not in your car.
The coffee downstairs was crafted perfectly, and don’t forget about the fresh baked goods or [what seemed] seasonal menu of delicious, light food/alcohol options. The space was bright, clean, and friendly. The curtain matched the drapes, so to speak.
Don’t hesitate to book this place. Check in and check out was a breeze. Respect this place like it is your own so much effort went into creating this space for us."

The kitchen was full stocked with everything we needed for the day /night. Check in was super easy. Lyndsay was attentive prior to arrival and also while we were there. We decided to try The Public House for dinner and drinks and we are glad we did. We travel a lot and love to try craft cocktails and small plates from around the globe and these did not disappoint. The drinks were so good as well! The next morning prior to leaving we decided to try the coffee shop under the airbnb location and we really enjoyed this experience as well.

I don't know how many guests would have the knowledge of how to make their own pour-over coffee and there were no directions. We ended up buying cups of coffee from the downstairs, which was delicious, but a little inconvenient first thing in the morning."

Something to note, there weren’t any board games like the description claims (I did not contact host about it though as we really didn’t need them), also some of the photos are outdated.
Only negative is that it could’ve been cleaned a bit better, it looked like things weren’t moved to sweep around, and there were dust webs in corners and on the lights fixtures.
Overall a nice stay."

Stayed one night","This listing had great interior design (very photo friendly), a lot of antiques and quirky things like every glass option you could imagine, and is in a perfect location for going out downtown and spending time by the water.
We found it wasn’t very accurate with the amenities, there wasn’t any board games or extra pillows and blankets, no shampoo or soap in the bathroom (other than hand soap), or coffee provided (although there is a coffee shop downstairs). I’m used to staying at locations that go above and beyond to make your stay comfortable and it felt like the focus of this listing is on the design.
Also be aware there is no TV (which is communicated in the listing) or sound system for music.
There were also 3 closets/rooms locked that we thought maybe were locked on accident and some of the items I mentioned were located there, but that is just speculation. In the future I’ll probably stay at a local hotel."

We left with plans to create more intention in our own space, inspired by this stay. The coffeeshop down below is lovely, too. I only wish we had arrived earlier-- get here as close to check in as you can, to fully enjoy the space!"

We were only able to get away for one night so we didn’t spend a ton of time other in the apartment other than coming and going as we walked around downtown and in the evening when we sat by the fire pit and slow danced under the moonlight on the roof top.
We took advantage of having the coffee shop below us and literally walked everywhere once we arrived.
Thank you for the perfect place for us to celebrate our 7th wedding anniversary!"

Bring binoculars if you want to see the birds though! The Public House has great drinks and we walked around and stopped into an antique store. Great quick overnight trip for two!"

Stayed a few nights","Absolutely beautiful space for our quiet, summer weekend in Bay City. The apartment was a bit bigger than I had expected. I surprised my boyfriend for his birthday with the trip and the space definitely gave the ""WOW! This is amazing!!"" reaction I was hoping for. :) We drove up after work so I am very grateful we were able to do a bit later check-in. Communication with Lyndsay was always prompt, and she is so helpful.
The private rooftop patio was so wonderful to make some Harless + Hugh coffee and enjoy in the mornings. She has the place stocked with coffee gadgets so you can make your own perfect cup. Or you can go downstairs for a cup and enjoy the coffee shop's cute patio with locals.
All of the restaurants and bars are a short walk away, making it easy to play the weekend by ear. One of the mornings we rented kayaks on Saginaw River (only 6 minutes away). We also enjoyed the state park (I recommend the Tobico Trail head!) and stopped to dip our feet into Saginaw Bay (both are about 10 minutes away).
Could not recommend this place and Lyndsay as a host enough. Looking forward to the next time we can visit."

The rest of the house was very clean and as expected. The neighborhood was a little concerning when we pulled in but we had no issues at all with noise or people in the area.
All in all I was very pleased with Big Blue except for the kitchen."

This house is in the perfect area to be able to enjoy your trip to Bay City! Within a 6-10 minute drive of pretty much anything you would need or want. I would love to stay again during the summer/spring to be able to enjoy the hot tub and fire pit as well!"

The accommodations are exactly as pictured/described in the listing and are perfect for a crowd. There are ample opportunities to spread out throughout the house- the upstairs lounge area is fabulous!
The neighborhood is quiet and close to downtown bars, restaurants, and several local businesses. The runner in our group felt safe taking evening runs and was please to discover several running trails nearby.
The kitchen is well stocked-we made dinner for 7 almost every night and had everything we needed to do so. DO NOT sleep on Jack’s Fruit and Meat market if you’re planning to cook. Super fresh produce and the most beautiful cuts of meat I’ve ever seen.
The hosts are pleasant and very communicative."

There were multiple bugs in the master bathroom, false eyelashes from past renters, rugs coated in dog hair, dust coated vents, and piles of dust under the couch and media unit. The other main complaint is the lack of hand soap in 2/3 of the bathrooms and that the smoke detector in the master bedroom was missing. We reached out to the owner prior to leaving this review about our concerns, but never heard back."

There was PLENTY of room for our stay of 4 and two dogs. Bonus points for a full master bedroom on the main floor so the in-laws didn't have to worry about climbing stairs!
The beds were big and comfy and the living and dining area had plenty of room for us to enjoy the areas together in the evening. Plenty of supplies and linen when needed, and lots of utensils, plates, etc. They have anything you think your family might need. Wi-fi and the signal was strong.
The location was great being close to many restaurants and options. The hosts Jason and Jamie were awesome! Can't stress how great the communication was -- very responsive with info from booking through checkout and they were able to accommodate our request for a later checkout.
We loved everything about this AirBnB. Would recommend this home and host to anyone needing to stay in the area!"

The biggest bonus though, for me, was “TheTable.” We were all able to gather around the table and have one of our traditional family discussions. The memories we created here are for a lifetime.
Big Blue may just be our family’s go to location for all of our home trips. Huge thanks to the wonderful host for being very thoughtful in putting this place together for my family and family and friend groups alike."

The house is just like the photos, hot tub was great. Had to trouble shoot on my own, but figured out how to clear the vent to let the heater work better. Beds were comfy. Tvs are very nice. Host was responsive. My friends and I had a blast together. 10/10 trip. Only con to this is the surrounding area, so like I said if you’re looking for a place just to chill out at home for a weekend, this is your place. Don’t expect anything crazy from the city."

Enjoyed the little local bar just 1 block away and the hot tub was clean and functioned well. Was glad there were security cameras and although upon first impression I was unsure of the neighborhood, I had absolutely no problems with anyone or anything. Would go back if I ever find myself in Bay City on vacation again. Thanks for hosting my son and I and helping us create some life long memories ❤️"

It was a relatively short drive to Frankenmuth and to the Bay City State Park beach. We were surrounded by a revitalized downtown and riverfront and had plenty of eating and pub-type options. The riverfront was one block to the west and was peaceful and relaxing. The place itself was great and had everything we needed for a few days' stay. It was clean. Parking wasn't a challenge even though there is no assigned parking directly for the space. We would stay again if we are in the area. Thanks, Donald!!"

The bedside white noise machines are such a thoughtful idea, and the bedside charging ports are convenient. The hosts welcomed us with water and Cokes- very kind. So, the most amazing feature is the mattress- expect to sleep the best you’ve slept in a long time! Our stay involved a downtown concert within walking distance which made our stay extremely convenient and fun!! Everything was super clean and the view from the second floor allows some hood people-watching opportunities! The restaurant down below has great food!! We would be happy to return! Thankful for Donald’s hospitality and kindness!"

Stayed a few nights","Definitely enjoyed my 5 night stay in Bay City. I loved the location. Close to Saginaw River. Enjoyed walks along boardwalk, exploring across river at Kantzler Memorial Arboretum, walking Riverwalk Pier and footbridge over to Bigelow Park (island). Lots of artwork placed over city to discover. Bay City is a popular place in the evenings with a variety of restaurants. Roads are closed nearby to allow for outdoor dining.
Parking wasn't bad. Typically I found a spot around the corner. After 9p able to relocate to spot where car was visible. Since my stay included weekdays, a parking pass was provided. Noise levels from restaurant patrons was tolerable for me. Wood floors in my apt and above me pretty squeaky but not bothersome for me. Was mindful when using bathroom in the middle of the night. After 11p quiet hrs observed.
Apt was clean but recommend deep cleaning. Would like to see kitchen bakeware & containers provided. Overall, pleasant experience and would stay here again."

We had several family members 'visit' us which was great - it was open and enabled us to gather with 6-8 family members easily. All said they would keep this location in mind for future visits (both those who live in Bay City and those who also were visiting). (The stairs were a slight issue only because they were carpeted and it had snowed so those with issues on stairs were slightly apprehensive but no one had any actual issues)."

Stayed a few nights","This is a clean property in a great location. There are MANY shops and restaurants within walking area. (We recommend Gatsby's or River City for dinner and Mandy's for breakfast.)
We never had trouble finding street parking. There was a lot of live music in the area mid-week. There is a riverwalk located nearby that was great to walk on. Donald's unit is no frills...think clean bachelor pad. I would suggest bringing pillows from home if you like firmer pillows. Toiletries included were bar soap and shampoo for the shower and hand soap for the bathroom sink. We appreciated the soft toilet paper. Don't laugh...some places stock the stuff that is a step above sandpaper. The kitchen had the usual pots, pans, dishes, silverware. Don't expect a lot in the way of spices and other cooking essentials. This was fine for us as we ate out for all of our meals. Donald thoughtfully included 4 bottles of water, 4 cans of Coke, and 4 cans of Diet Coke chilling in the fridge. There are two bars located directly under the unit and the building is vintage, so if you are a light sleeper, bring earplugs and maybe have a white noise app on your phone. (To be clear, the bars catered to chatting adults, not rowdy college kids, but since we were there in the summer, there was outdoor seating outside the living area and one of the bedrooms.)"

Stayed with kids","Loved our stay in this cozy apartment. The location is hard to beat with plenary to do and eat within walking distance. Once you are inside, you’ll feel at home. Everything is very comfortable and there is everything you’d need for however long you stay. Make sure you stop by Populous coffee around the corner."

Stayed with kids","We had a wonderful stay! Contactless check in and out were conveniently easy. The apartment was extremely clean and beautifully furnished. The beds were so comfortable, we all had the best sleep we’ve had in a while. All the amenities were as promised (plenty of towels, full kitchen, etc). The location is ideal, within steps of the river and surrounded by many restaurants, bars, and shops. We traveled with our 4-year-old and 3-week-old daughters, the former wanted to stay for “a hundred days” while the latter seems content. All-in-all, we had a great trip with absolutely no complaints."
