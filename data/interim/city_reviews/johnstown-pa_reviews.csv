Stayed with kids","Traveled to attend a funeral and our original Airbnb location had to cancel due to the furnace not working. That was a blessing in disguise. Stumbled across this gem. Beautiful. You can hear the faint sound of the train horn in your sleep. (My kids and I are train enthusiasts) if you get up early enough for breakfast you’ll see them come by. The pictures of the rooms don’t do the property justice compared to how homey the place actually feels in person. My family felt right at home. You can watch Netflix on the Smart TV. However make sure it’s connected to the WiFi first. It wasn’t automatically connected when we turned it on. The kitchen was stocked with more than essential items to save you from running to the store because you forgot to bring/stop and get items before you came in. Bathrooms were nice and clean with provided body wash, hair conditioner, towels etc. Would definitely stay again"

Stayed with kids","We needed a place to stay for our boys 4 hockey games in Ebensburg and Johnstown. The location was in between the towns which made it easy to get to all of the games.
The fridge was stocked with drinks and the freezer had some food, too. This was so nice when we arrived with our three hungry 13 year old boys.
Joseph's place was clean and spatious. We felt right at home. If we come back to the area again, we will definitely rebook.
We needed a late checkout due to our game times and Joseph was extremely flexible."

Stayed with a pet","Very clean home. You can tell it was recently renovated. Host was kind enough to provide drinks/toiletries. He was very responsive to messages. Entering the home was a bit difficult as you have to go up a steep set of stairs, so a bit difficult if you have mobility issues. Nice backyard with a patio. Parking was a bit tricky due to the funeral home across the street, but manageable. We would stay here again if the need arose."

Group trip","This place was perfect for us. We needed a place close to get our daughter from camp and it was 5 minutes away. The place was spotless and had so many extras. There were options for breakfast galore - frozen items, cereal, juice, eggs and milk. Extra toothbrushes, tooth paste, shampoo..... Would certainly stay again.
Joseph was very quick to respond and kept us in the loop for getting settled.
Only two complaints. One was I couldn't find a strainer/colander but that certainly was nothing to make me miserable and who knows, i probably missed it. Second, I have bad knees and the set of stairs to get up to the property were tough, manageable, but tough.
Really was comfortable and perfect for what we needed."

It was wonderful to have a bit of cereal (organic milk was in the frig) a Jimmy Dean's breakfast bowl, bottled water and juice. Just a little bite to hold you over while you have that extra cup of coffee on the back porch swing. Thanks, Joseph; you made our trip ""home"" most enjoyable. We'll be back!"

Stayed one night",I live in Virginia but was born and raised in South Fork. My wife and I took a couple of Virginia native friends to visit the area. Our stay at Joseph’s place could not have been better. Clearly one of the best homes in South Fork. The house was extremely clean and quite comfortable. You do need to be able to navigate some stairs to both get into the house and to the bedrooms but that is pretty much commonplace with all houses in South Fork. Joseph was very responsive and provided easy to follow directions on how to enter the house. Would definitely stay there again!!

The back patio was nice. We didn’t get to enjoy it as much as we could have, but having morning coffee out there was perfect.
Joseph was helpful when we needed recommendations, and accommodated our request for a later check out.
Many thanks!"

The house was better stocked than a high-end hotel room, and at a great price! We liked that the captured bedroom kept the kids in the back, through another bedroom (not that the area left any worry- it was serene and quiet all day and night.) We also liked that there was another bedroom that had privacy. The water pressure was better than at home, there were more than enough beds. House instructions were easy to find and understand, and our host was friendly and accommodating. Can't say enough about this place. The kids wanted to move in!"

Beds were very comfortable and the spacious living areas likewise. The complimentary food and drinks were generous and helped save time. The location offered beautiful walks and the yard/deck were lovely and quiet. My daughter and I were visiting my sick brother and the house made for a restful place to relax. Cost was very reasonable and a great bargain. When I return to the area, if this house is available I would not even consider looking for a different place to stay."

Stayed with kids","The house is just as described and pictured! The kitchen is pretty large and well-equipped. The living room is huge with a giant comfy sectional. The second floor bedrooms are spacious and the beds are super supportive. The whole place is super clean and feels like home away from home! My family of 7 stayed comfortably.
The stairs outside are a bit steep and the wi-fi is kind of slow. But from my experience visiting relatives nearby, that's more of a regional/location issue than a problem with this specific house. (The only people really upset by the ""poor"" internet were the kids, but thankfully they survived somehow. 😵‍💫) The neighborhood is pleasant, it was quiet at night, and the views are beautiful, especially with the leaves starting to change color!
Joseph was responsive and is a great host. I would definitely recommend this house and host, and would stay again for sure!"

The place had all of the necessities plus many extras for a few night stay. The house is spotless, everything felt new and fresh including the appliances and carpeting. The back porch has a relaxing swing.
Something to be aware of is the staircase leading to the upstairs bedrooms are steep. There is a daybed and full bathroom on the first floor.
The neighborhood outside the house was very quiet. The house is close the johnstown flood national memorial and visitors center.
This is a great place to stay in South Fork."

Stayed with kids",This was a great place to stay while in South Fork for a family event. The house was exactly as described and the hosts have thought of so many little details that make the place easy to settle in to. Communication was seamless and responses were quick! Very clean! My only suggestion for future people who stay here is to know that the stairs to the bedrooms (upstairs) are very steep - anyone with mobility issues may have a hard time getting up and down the steps.

Stayed a few nights","This was our first AirBNB stay, and Joseph set the bar high. The house was great, and in a good location for me. He was very responsive to questions, usually replying within a minute or 2 of asking. My only negative would be the wifi. The house only uses streaming TV (no cable or air antenna), and the internet speed is really slow, especially in the evening. I was excited to be able to watch the Steelers on Friday, but couldn't keep a strong enough signal to watch. It worked fine in the morning, so it may have been an issue with the ISP Friday night. Otherwise a great stay. I would definitely recommend."

Stayed a few nights","Wow, wow, wow! 5 stars! Joe's place was an amazing home to stay in for our family trip. I grew up in the area and wanted a place for my family to stay while I was in town visiting family. I could not believe the deal on this beautiful home...and it's dog friendly! Our 2 Corgi's are our world, and they travel with us, so dog friendly is a MUST! The pictures are beautiful, but they do not do the home justice. The downstairs has beautiful flooring, a washer and dryer, large kitchen with all the essentials, a kitchen table and chairs, a bathroom, a large living room with a beautiful sectional couch and big screen TV, and a room off the living room with a daybed. We enjoyed cooking meals in the kitchen each day, as well as the Keurig coffee pot. We also enjoyed the beautiful covered patio, complete with a picnic table and porch swing. I enjoyed sitting out there at night with a drink and taking in the sounds of the trains in sleepy little South Fork. Our Corgi's loved the big back yard, and we were so happy to find a pet friendly home! The upstairs was beautiful in its own right. 3 comfortable rooms with one queen bed, one double bed, and an attached room with bunk beds. The beds and pillows were heavenly! The upstairs bathroom had a wonderful shower, and the entire place was squeaky clean. Plenty of closet space, as well! The carpeting was new and plush. We had several questions for Joe throughout our stay, and he was very speedy in answering us. He even left a local newspaper on the front porch for us daily. It was also a very hot week, and the downstairs and upstairs AC kept the house very cool and comfortable. We enjoyed our week at Joe's place. It felt like home, and we didn't want to leave. We made many family memories that are sure to last a lifetime. We will be back!"

We felt right at home here. The house itself is quite big and bigger then we expected with tons of sleeping options. It's recently renovated so everything is extremely modern, new, and clean. We loved our stay here in this sleepy little town. There was some really nice added amenities for our stay including plenty of breakfast items and drinks. There was also a lovely little backyard and patio with a swing bench and a gravity chair and picnic table so it was really nice sitting outside eating our breakfast and sipping our coffee listening to the birds chirping. The neighbors were very friendly and loved our dogs. There is a good amount of parking next door and on the street. There is also laundry available. Joe was very communicative and responsive. I would absolutely recommend staying at his Airbnb and think he's well on his way to becoming a Super host."

Although refurbished there were some items which were from my days growing up! A picnic table built by my Dad & Clyde Wadsworth and the swing which my Mom & Dad used to put their grandchildren to sleep!
I highly recommend this B & B to anyone visiting South Fork or the surrounding area! Joe was a gracious host & available for any of our needs!

Stayed one night","We had a great stay at Christopher's house. Unfortunately we were only there one night, so we didn't get to take advantage of the beautiful kitchen, or the fire pit and the view. But the house is charming, with beautiful original woodwork, and very clean and well-appointed. The only thing that was ""unexpected"" was that the 2nd bathroom, as has been mentioned, is in the basement. Christopher was very proactive with information, and the house rules were clearly spelled out. We found a good spot for dinner based on the information he has provided to guests. If we ever find ourselves coming back to the area, we will definitely try to book this house again!"

Group trip","We were in town for a wedding and this place was lovely to stay in. Christopher reached out before our arrival to give us the door pin and everything went smoothly. A couple things to be aware of before booking:
* The basement is very short - I am 6'2"" and could not stand up in it
* There is one bathroom upstairs, and one in the basement. The basement one essentially has no door (it's a sliding door, but you can't sit on the toilet while it's closed)"

Loved the place. The kitchen was well stocked and clean. Bathrooms spotless. Linens were cozy and comfortable. The master has black out shades which were great for an afternoon siesta! The backyard was lovely, fenced in and very private.

Our only disappointment was that we didn’t get there a week earlier and have the nice fall weather so that we could enjoy the backyard area and fire pit. Instead we had a little snow & cold weather but we were super cozy in the Dreamy Cottage . The neighborhood was beautiful & was blanketed in snow. What a beautiful and safe neighborhood as well - we felt totally safe staying at this location. Five stars all the way!!! Thank you, Lisa!"

This home is the exact opposite. The host truly cares about her home. If you are an art lover this is the place for you. I did not love every piece, but I loved looking at every piece. I was obvious that Lisa loves art or is an artist. The home is remarkable spacious, with a wonderful use of all the unique features of a 1920's home. It is refreshingly clean and for a person who has serious OCD that says a lot. It really needs more than 5 stars. Johnstown is a bit sleepy and conventional, this home is definitely not what you would expect here. So if you want to stay in a very special home, I would urge you to try this one."

I was looking for a place that would allow me to disconnect from the hustle and bustle of the city and stay in a quiet place, the great thing about this house is that you were about 20-30 minutes from the ""city"" (Ulta, Tj Maxx, Walmart etc.) or main street towns full of charm and boutiques with mountain views!

Stayed with kids","I stayed for 3 nights with my 3 children (ages 12, 7, and 4). We were in town for a hockey tournament. The house was super close to downtown Johnstown (8 minutes!) and was absolutely perfect.
Rick was super responsive with any questions I had and extremely kind.
The house itself is a perfect combination of practical and cozy. Everything you need is already there (dishwasher pods, laundry detergent, wash cloths, towels, pots, pans, kitchen appliances etc...) and the decor and set up is clean, neat, and peaceful while also feeling really welcoming! It's simply adorable.
My kids loved the puzzles, deck of cards, and TV in the sunroom, and I LOVED the coffee bar for our early morning hockey game wake ups, and also sitting on the side porch at the end of the night in a rocker with a cup of tea and blanket.
All of the details are just perfectly thought through!
Having laundry on site was also a huge bonus!"

Stayed a few nights","Airbnb was nicely decorated and clean. Overall it was an okay stay. Coffee bar was cute and well stocked. There are a few things I wish I had known about the place before booking. This house has a Jack and Jill style bathroom. One bedroom has a glass door, meaning that they do not have privacy. I was traveling with a coworker and that was not ideal. Lastly, the house sits right behind a fire station, and we were woken up twice during our 4 day stay from the sirens.
Some small touches are missing in the house like rug tape to keep them from sliding across the floor (almost fell over multiple times). The lights around the top of the rooms are beautiful but they aren't on a switch so you have to follow the cords and unplug them from the wall."

Stayed a few nights","Well, the house is amazing and very comfortable for a short stay... the neighborhood & town was completely peaceful to go home to after a long day of work, we had what was expected as the pictures showed. However, they are a bit misleading as you have to park on Maggie St to access the property (top side of the hill), not noted in the description. The coffee pot had to be moved to the kitchen for power... the 2nd tv on the front porch does not reach any power outlets... the Christmas lights are always on unless you physically unplug them. NO MICROWAVE or WASHER & DRYER ACCESS. Then there was the lack of information about the home being right next to the volunteer fire departments station & emergency sirens. Other than that, great place to stay!"

Everything was clean, Jennifer was quick to respond to questions we had before our stay, and there were many good activities for kids.

Stayed a few nights","Perfect for our needs. We were in town for a celebration and couldn’t stay with family due to some recent damage to their home & the resulting construction. Keith’s place was tidy, cozy, quiet, & convenient. Having coffee & snacks available as we walked in was so welcome after a very long drive from out of state. The full kitchen was important & saved us from having to rely on take-out. The grocery store is a minute away & also has a gas station on-site. Keith’s place is embedded in a regular neighborhood & at the onset of a sudden downpour one of the neighbors was kind enough to knock on our door to let us know our car windows were open (THANK YOU otherwise we would have had very damp dupas on our next drive)! The WIFI was strong & allowed us to finish homework and other business stuff without hassle.
I felt safe here.
I highly recommend Keith’s place, especially for families & travelers who may have a block of downtime during their visit and need to recharge in a homey environment."

Stayed one night","Keith was a great host. We booked this place overlooking that there was a two night minimum and when our plans changed, he gave almost a full refund for the second night. The place was very clean but I must say, very dated with dark paneling in the bedrooms and basic amenities and for that, I think it's a bit overpriced. We have stayed in really nice motels with lots of amenities and full breakfasts for less than what we paid. More photos would have been helpful but for many reasons, I would definitely recommend it. It was peaceful in a very quiet neighborhood not far from everything we planned to do, so for that I'm grateful. Thank you, Keith."

I would deff stay here again next time I'm in town. Only thing I'd make others aware is that there is a full time tenant who lives on the 3rd floor they do not have any access to the part you are staying in so it is completely separate but just thought others might want to be made aware.

I was very comfortable. We had one little hiccup with the keyless entry pad where my code stopped working. Keith took a little longer than usual to respond but fixed it and gave me a back up code in case it would happen again. Other than that he was very responsive and even checked in halfway through my stay to make sure everything was good.

Stayed with kids","First I want to acknowledge that the Host Keith was very informative from the very start that I booked this Airbnb. I never stayed at an Airbnb in the Johnstown area and just never had a desire to do so …but We were throwing my mom a surprise party for her 70th birthday and lot of my family members have moved out of town so my options of staying with family were limited and I definitely didn’t want to stay at the Holiday Inn due to the new management. I am very happy I booked this Airbnb it was very clean, very quiet, very well put together, it was the little touches for me that made it so pleasant (i.e breakfast bars) also, my nephew forgot his toothbrush (😤) and thank goodness there was an extra new to brush in the bathroom which saved me from having to stop at the store …As I still had some things to take care of for the party and my time was limited. When I travel I like to feel at peace and this Airbnb was every bit of peaceful. Keith was a great host… this will definitely be my go to Airbnb for any future stays."

I arrived late and getting in the building was a little eerie as a solo female traveler. I had a little trouble getting in (pull the door knob toward you when it’s unlocking if you’re struggling). The space had a lot of amenities and it was really aesthetically pleasing.

Stayed with a pet","The studio unit is very cozy and decorated nicely. It is updated with modern furnishings, appliances, cabinets, bathroom etc. this is a lower level unit, so it’s kind of in a basement with no windows. I felt very isolated. No natural sunlight. You will occasionally hear footsteps, muffled voices, and movement from neighbors above you and next door. I enjoyed having a private entrance. There is a heating unit on the wall that worked well, but because it is a basement, it will get cold. they are pet friendly and there’s coin laundry. I enjoyed the convenience of being close to the hospitals that I was working at. The neighborhood is beautiful, peaceful, and safe. However, I had a difficulty finding the location using GPS on Maps. The hosts were very helpful and called to guide me."

It’s an old house with a lot of history. Some of the floorboards creak (expected in an old house) so you can’t sneak up on anyone!
There are two deadbolt locks on the front door. One locks to the left and the other one locks to the right. The owners were very quick to respond when I had trouble getting out of the house. Totally user error. Simple solution, lock only one deadbolt or remember they are backwards!
It’s a loft so it’s upstairs. Once you are up that flight of stairs everything is on one level and very cozy."

The renovations have made it a lovely, comfortable place to stay, and many special touches were included, like coffee (yay!) and toiletries, in case we forgot anything. Tim was proactive in ensuring that we found and got into the loft without issue and was extremely responsive to my reach-outs. He took time out of his busy schedule to meet with us at the Tioga Market so that we could purchase shirts and learn more about the history of the market and the loft. What an incredible property in the best part of Westmont. High recommend!"

Stayed with a pet","Leah’s place was beautiful! We felt right at home there. Loved the vibe & detail of the decor. The bed was comfortable along with all the chairs. Very cozy feeling.
This was the first Airbnb that provided an ample supply of bath towels, hand towels & washcloths! For some reason a lot of airbnbs we stay at never supply washcloths. This may sound small but it’s those little details that make for an easy & comfortable stay.
We were visiting family about 10mins from there, it’s in a good prime location easy to get around. We will definitely be booking Leah’s place again when we return.
One minor suggestion for anyone that is sensitive to sound I would encourage you to maybe bring some ear plugs, the radiators got pretty loud when the heat would click on, the pipes would bang and make a lot of noise which woke me up (I can be a light sleeper). The sound of the train however did not bother me, but it could bother others. I would still stay here again and highly recommend! 5 stars!"

Immaculate and very large living areas that offered plenty of space for my husband to work remotely, while I could be in another room. We loved the sunroom.
And it was appreciated that the lights were turned on in the rooms when we got there, as it was already after sunset. Great hosts."

Stayed with kids","This place is great! The location, for us, was fantastic. We love trains, and they're right across the street (no crossing nearby if you don't like whistles). We were able to walk to a couple of places (brewery), and the apartment sits separate from any other residential dwellings (as far as we could tell). It's spacious and decorated in a very fun way (which made for great Easter egg hiding spots during our Easter weekend stay). The records and tapes were a highlight for the 11 and 14-year-old. Should you have more than 2 people and not want to share a bed, the couch was comfy, according to 11. We were able to easily cook with our instant pot we brought along, so don't let the lack of full kitchen deter you if you can't eat every meal out. Leah and Ed are great; this is our second stay with them, and they have been responsive and helpful when needed. Will definitely stay with them again. If you have a pet, there's a walkway along the river that served our dog's needs well."

The place is a perfect location for concert goers because you can easily walk to and from the venue (1st summit arena) in less than 10 minutes! The space was exactly as described! The upstairs unit was over a photography studio, and across from an Amtrak station, and surrounded by a large parking lot. There weren’t a lot of people coming and going which gave a nice feeling of privacy to the stay. For dog owners, there’s a strip of grass next to the building, but if that’s not enough for your pups there’s some grass next to a paved walking trail right around the corner that worked well for our pups! The place was great, and the owner was very nice, and came out from the photography studio to say hi and check in on us when we were walking to our car in the morning. Fantastic place, will stay again when in Johnstown! Thank you Leah and Edward!"

Great parking, and I could auto start my car from the window. There are great eats and local shops within walking distance or a two minute drive - also easy parking. All easy access. By chance, Ed was heading out from the main floor studio when I arrived, and he took the time to offer a warm welcome. I didn't need anything during my visit, but I did send a quick message to offer my gratitude for a VERY clean and cozy experience, and Ed responded in seconds. On my last day out, I stopped in the studio, and Ed gave me some history on the building, the apartment decor, and the town. Appreciate the history and time! This is a great place to stay for any reason or no reason at all. Thanks to Leah and Ed!"

And we loved hanging out on the roof late and/or the steps in front of the studio taking in the scenes. Highly recommended for anything happening in downtown Johnstown."

If you are going to the Flood Museum, leave your car parked here and just walk the couple of blocks to the museum. The “museum parking” is closer to the rental than to the museum."

Stayed a few nights","We had an amazing time staying at this trendy loft apartment in Johnstown! The unit is located in an accessible part of Johnstown with very little traffic. The loft apartment is above the owner's photography studio and exceeded our expectations! Check-in was a breeze- the unit is airy, clean, and the lay-out is fantastic. Upon entering, you will ascend a flight of stairs to the apartment door. Once there, you will enter and the bathroom is on the right across from the first bedroom. Large size bathroom with a gorgeous free standing tub. Hot water and awesome water pressure make for a relaxing shower and bath. Further down the hall is the second 'master' bedroom with a comfortable bed and plenty of room to relax. Both bedrooms have ample windows and light, plenty of fluffy pillows and fresh linens, and comfy chairs/table lamps. The dining room is the first room you will enter and it has a beautiful table and chairs. To the right is the kitchen and the sun room. We can't say enough about this sun room! It is so spacious and offers a sofa and two very relaxing arm chairs/chaise lounges. It is filled with light and offers a beautiful view of the city- especially the Johnstown Incline Plane! The living room sits to the front of the unit and has a really cool stereo system, records, TV and comfortable sofa/chairs. We were so impressed with this unit for its lay-out and design, but also for the cleanliness and plentiful amenities. What made our experience even better than outstanding was the kind and thoughtful hosts, Edward and Leah. They are available to answer any questions you might have and go above and beyond to ensure you have everything you need for an amazing stay and experience in Johnstown. We reached out several times to ask for recommendations and they got back to us immediately with suggestions. We enjoyed our stay in Johnstown so much, we ended up staying longer! We highly recommend the hosts and their properties!"

It is on the second floor of a cool, old building, up an easy flight of stairs. Everything felt very well taken care of in the apartment and there were plentiful bath linens available.
We stayed in the apartment to take a class at the Center for Metal Arts, which is only half a mile away. There were many restaurants within walking distance, though many of them closed at 6:00 on Saturday and were closed on Sunday, so do your research. It is also directly across the street from the Amtrak station, so you could conceivably take the train to town and leave your car behind.
Leah was a wonderful host and very communicative. Check-in was very smooth."

I used this space as a venue to spend a quiet night with a few bridesmaids the night before my wedding, and a venue for getting ready the day of my wedding. Everything was impeccably clean and decorated beautifully. The apartment is spacious and there was more than enough room for everyone to spread out! All of my bridesmaids and my photographer could not stop complimenting the space and the breathtaking views from the sunroom and rooftop. We loved it so much that we did a rooftop photo shoot, even in the cold October rain! I can not recommend this space enough and how absolutely perfect it is for this purpose. Leah and Ed were both excellent hosts and were quick to communicate the entire weekend and answer all of my questions. This space enhanced my wedding experience and I am so grateful that Johnstown has such a beautiful location for visitors and locals to stay and gain a new appreciation for the city."

It was so much nicer than staying in a hotel and only having one room, two beds and a tv. My son is 17 years old so he enjoyed the enclosed porch and having a room to himself. It was nice to come back to the apartment and relax. We were not in each other’s way since we had so many rooms to escape to. The decor was so cool. Great place to stay to enjoy the Johnstown area. And we enjoyed the vinyl records. Had music on all weekend."

Stayed with kids","Leah & Ed's place far exceeded our expectations!
Their 2 bedroom flat looked nice & clean in the photos. In person, you get a fun, cozy vintage vibe that a photo just can't convey! Their vintage motorcycle repair parts, old oil cans, antique mirrors, turntable stereo system with a big basket of albums and mid-century mod furniture & decor is SPOT ON! The flat was very roomy with a big kitchen with mini fridge and oversized farm sink, dining room, living room and the super sunny funky sunroom! The huge bathroom was well-appointed with plenty of fresh white towels, washcloths, soap, shampoo & conditioner. I opened the vanity to look for the hair dryer and found even more supplies that a traveler might need. The shower head and water pressure were perfect! The two bedrooms were large, beds were very firm and comfortable with cozy duvets and bed linens. Our group consisted of 3 females, 1 male and 1 infant. The bigger bedroom was plenty big to accommodate the pack & play for the baby to sleep in. We also really appreciated that the dresser in each room had big mirrors attached as well as great lighting so that we could do hair & makeup outside the bathroom.
One note: the stairs at the entrance are rather steep. It wasn't a problem for us but might be if you have trouble with stairs.
The location in downtown Johnstown fit our needs perfectly. If you are going to Jtown for sightseeing, you will be just a block or two from the Flood Museum, Amtrack is across the street, grocery store is less than a mile away as are the Incline Plane and the stadium. Don't forget to pick up some Coney Island dogs and some gobs!
This space made this our most comfortable trip back to Johnstown yet. Ed & Leah were very accommodating with some small needs we had on arrival--very gracious hosts! We look forward to staying here again."

The apartment was spacious, sparkly clean, had a nice LP player and a little collection of vinyl records that we enjoyed, and super comfortable beds!
If you're noise sensitive you may need to bring ear plugs because the trains run during the night as well. I don't mind the noise, which is usually not intrusive (no whistling, just passing by), but it's something to consider. We really enjoyed renting bikes from a local tubing company and biking the flood trail, as well as seeing the flood museum."

Stayed a few nights","Big, spacious, squeaky clean apartment all to your self. Early 1900s architecture and mid century furnishing, with an industrial vibe makes this a fun place to stay. The mattresses are modern and really comfortable (clearly not the owners hand me down). Really large full bathroom with clawfoot tub and a dramatic 4 season porch. From the corkscrew to tons of fresh white towels, no detail is missed by our host.
The location is across from a sleepy Amtrak station (the trains are not noisy, and present only as low rumble) and super close to Main street Johnstown. You can almost throw a rock at the Johnstown Flood Museum. Minutes from the Johnstown Funicular, art galleries, shops, Heritage Discovery Center, Historic Grandview Cemetery.
Had a great meal from Balance on Main Street. Parking is metered and coin operated. 30 mn per half hour. Remember to grab some quarters, but there was plenty of on street parking or a municipal parking garage is available where you can pay with a card at the kiosk before exiting. Asiago Italian restaurant is just up the hill near the Grandview Cemetery and the top of the funicular and its gift shop. Curbside ordered dinner on second night from them. Convenient and good food to take back to the apartment. Check out the eclectic Westmont neighborhood tucked between Grandview and the top of the funicular before returning to the apartment.
Do not miss the many public parks in the area. Do not be intimidated by the hills. Stackhouse Park is close by and includes paths for every level of walk/hike ability. We were there early spring as things were just starting to green up. Great views or babbling brook, its all here. Will comeback in the high season to check out the Mill Rats play ball."

I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again if we are ever in Johnstown."

Leah was very communicative and quick to offer us tips for our stay, which was very appreciated."

Stayed a few nights","We loved staying at Leah and Edward’s incredible apartment.
The screened in porch and bathroom are straight out of a magazine!
The first night there were two trains in the middle of the night but fortunately the a/c provided some white noise. The second night there was a massive wedding outside so we were super grateful that again the a/c drowned out the sound.
We were so happy that we found somewhere that was dog friendly that was so nice. We don’t want to compromise the luxury of a nice stay, but we hate to travel dogless."

Stayed with kids","The apartment is very stylish, clean, and nicely appointed. The area is very industrial - right next to the railway and surrounded by warehouses but was very quiet on the weekend when we were there. I'm not sure what the noise levels would be like for the train when the AC wasn't running but we didn't have any trouble sleeping. The biggest issue for us was specific to our family. We were traveling across country with our toddler and all the vintage touches of antique road signs and vinyl records on the ground were not toddler friendly. We spent a lot of time chasing after our toddler when he was awake trying to ensure that he didn't break anything or try to lick the rusty signs. Overall, a very stylishly redone apartment. Best for adult travelers."

Stayed one night","This air bnb is so cozy, we were under the impression it was surrounded by greenery but it's definitely in an industrial location. We loved it and didn't mind as it was quiet and comfortable. Water pressure in the shower is awesome and unfortunately many air bnbs I've stayed in do not get that hot. Everything was so clean and we loved the vintage touches. Subtitles on the TV made it easy to watch as I have difficulty hearing. Some TVS are difficult to find how to place captions. I loved the patio and looking at the steep train tracks. The roof is also a calm place to relax and view everything. We did travel around Johnstown but didnt fancy the area and we were viewing homes to see if we would want to live around town. Air bnb is definitely 5 stars! Plenty of coffee and we left brand new icecream as our 6/7 hour trip back home it would surely melt. Thankyou for making it super easy to book!"

Stayed a few nights","This stay was truly one of the finest AirBnb stays that I have experienced. Being a Johnstown PA native, Leah’s place truly resembled what it’s like to be from Johnstown PA! The location is excellent, you’re right off of RT56 by the Point Stadium, so it’s easy access to all points in Johnstown.
The host responded immediately to all of my messages & made the process of checking in extremely easy. The place is extremely clean & feels literally brand new. The place is well furnished with elegant clean bedding. All amenities that are needed for a home away from home are there for you. There is plenty of parking that makes access to the place extremely easy. I felt as safe and welcomed here as I do in my own home. It is decorated with a touch of Victorian style appeal for the ladies & motorcycle/classic car appeal for the fellas. Literally, it is a couples retreat for any age group. I highly recommended this stay for anyone, you truly will not be disappointed.
On an extra note, if you are to attend Johnstown’s famous Thunder in the Valley motorcycle rally, there is NO better spot in Cambria county to stay! I hope everyone enjoys Leah’s place as much as I did. I surely will be back!"

It was exactly as pictured. The fenced in yard was just right for my dog. The covered porches were enjoyable to sit on and great for some peace and fresh air. 2 bathrooms(1 up and 1 down) were definitely a great amenity. The kitchen was easy to get around and cook in. There was even a radio and some LED lights! The kitchen was were I hung out the most.
There are also books to read and puzzles to do and there was even a mad libs book! There is a small pool table/foosball/hockey game as well. The little pool table was fun. I'm not a reader but I found myself wanting to read a book while I was there.
The beds were comfortable and everything was clean. I can't say enough good things about Tracey and her Farmhouse! I wish her great success and would stay there again.

Stayed a few nights","Tracey is like a concierge at a 5-star hotel: so thoughtful, nice, communicative. All the amenities in a well-loved and well-maintained, old farmhouse that feels like your best friend’s home and is truly dog-friendly.
The special touches truly stand out: a detailed guidebook, firewood, first aid kit, ice packs in the freezer, books, games, puzzles, fishing poles, paper plates, extra towels, comfy blankets, high-quality pots & pans, great plates set & big mugs/glasses, big Weber outdoor gas grill, much more.
Tracey’s photos and descriptions are accurate. The rooms are spacious, the beds were surprisingly very comfortable, and the kitchen had all the essentials, including coffee fixings & bottled water.
We especially enjoyed the covered porches, the fenced-in backyard for our two (big) dogs, the fire pit under the stars, the peaceful location. Tracey understands that dogs are family.
We stayed because it’s conveniently located near Saint Francis University. Will stay again!"

Tracey was on the property twice during our stay to take care of the friendly chickens but they were so discrete that we never even noticed them show up or leave or be there either time other than Tracey letting us know via a message. The house is well appointed and I loved that every room from bedrooms to TV room had throw blankets. It was definitely a house in which to cuddle with a good book! The internet was fast despite the secluded location. Tracey left water and coffee to get us started. I didn't take advantage of the kitchen as I was only there for a one night stay. I will definitely use the property again in the future when I need something in the area.

Stayed with a pet","Tracey was a great hostess, communicating with us and checking in to see if we needed anything. She has arranged the home to make you feel ""at home"" and we really appreciated all the extra touches. We were meeting our college age son for a visit, halfway between both our homes. Tracey's kitchen was well stoked with every cooking implement, and I cooked lots of home-made foods for his birthday & St. Patrick's Day.
The views out every window were lovely. We had great night's sleep as the mattresses were amazingly comfortable. We woke our first morning to the sounds of turkeys ""gobbling"" in the woods and birdsong. You can't beat that. Also, the home is close to many interesting places to visit. We went to the Johnstown Flood Museum, Fallingwaters, Latrobe, PA - home of Mr. Rogers and the wonderful Mr. Rogers exhibition at St. Vincent College and the Allegheny Portage Railroad National Historic site. AND, there was still plenty to do - we just ran out of time. We hope to come back again."

Stayed a few nights","My fiance and I stayed here for the weekend to do some wedding planning stuff in Pittsburgh, and enjoy the nature the Johnstown area has to offer. The house itself is so beautifully decorated, and we enjoyed the cozy homey atmosphere as we put together our save the dates & other exciting things. Our only complaint is that this rental isn't closer to our venue!! If it was, we'd definitely be back again this time next year to get ready here for our wedding. The place is so cute and eclectic for pictures and feels homey. Also- the king bed was SUPER comfy and hosts worked hard to make us feel welcome in the space. They also made sure we were privy to anything we'd need to know before our stay! Definitely recommend."

Stayed with kids",Super cute house with charm. Reminded me of my grandma and grandpas house but cuter. Had some old house quirks but didn’t bother me at all. Only thing is the neighborhood wasn’t the best. I felt safe in the house but I wouldn’t go for a walk or run in the neighborhood. At one point some guy was outside on hide phone screaming obscenities. Other than that it was perfect.

Sara has an awesome eye for decor and we had so much fun being surrounded by all of it. She has added so many nice touches throughout that do not go unnoticed. We even cooked many side dishes in the kitchen to bring to our family Thanksgiving, which was well equipped for what we needed. Our king bed was so comfy that we were sad to leave it.
All in all, an amazing place for a great price. We will be back when coming to the area!"

Her price is great, and it's truly beyond what I thought I would find in Johnstown. We will be back if it's available for sure! (My other traveling family members now know about Sara's place, so I may have to race to book first for our future family get-togethers!)
You should definitely check this place out!!!"

The house matched the description and pictures. It was spacious, beautifully decorated and extremely functional. The place was fully stocked with everything imaginable like toilet paper, paper towels, etc. We loved the small details like free snacks, a hand written welcome note and a bottle of local Cambria County wine.
The house was extremely clean overall and bathrooms were pristine. The wifi was strong and we were able to log in to our apps via Roku on the TV. Sara was extremely responsive through this whole process as well. I messaged her once during the trip and she responded within seconds. She was also went above and beyond to give local recommendations in Johnstown.

Stayed a few nights",We loved staying in the spacious room. The wing off the side definitely gave us privacy. I’m a bit of a clean freak so to come to a an Airbnb that was as clean as my own house was refreshing. We felt comfortable as soon as we stepped inside. Beautiful and peaceful. Thanks again!

Stayed a few nights","Kristina is awesome in every way.
She went out of her way to assist me with learning about the wonderful Johnstown area, history, and ""culture"". The room and bath was very private and I slept like rock in sateen sheets! The Internet was strong enough to do video calls and meetings for work. We departed with a quick tour of the local Center For Metal Arts school. I encourage everyone to check it out and make a donation to their non-profit!
I can't wait to return!"

Stayed one night","I had a lovely stay at this location. It is conveniently located near the Arena, flood museum and nice restaurants. You even have a view of the famous incline from the kitchen window. Antonio is very responsive and wants to take care of his guests. This is a historic building with an apartment that has been updated and has all the necessities to make your stay enjoyable. Don’t let the older outside exterior fool you. I’m glad I stayed here rather than the Holiday Inn around the corner. It is peaceful, spacious and nice to have our own kitchen."
