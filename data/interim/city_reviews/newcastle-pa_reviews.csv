Group trip","Candice’s place was just what we needed for a last minute trip to the area for a funeral. She was so quick to respond with answers to the questions we had about our arrival. We didn’t use much of what the place offers but what we did use worked great for the 6 of us (2 adults and 4 teens). Thanks so much, Candice!"

Group trip",We came with 6 girls for a bachelorette weekend and I can't say enough good things about our experience. Candice was great to work with and so patient with my questions and booking process. She even helped us find an uber to take us around. The outdoor seating area was a great spot to hang out and enjoy the evening! She takes care of her property and we felt right at home. You can easily tell that Candice put this home together with her guests in mind. The house was so clean with great decor and the beds were comfortable. The outside area is perfect with the hanging lights and fire pit. Plenty of seating inside and outside. She gave me recommendations for wineries and places to go in the evenings. The check in and out process was easy and well explained. I highly recommend this property!

Stayed with kids","I rate Candice’s Airbnb 5/5. Our family stay for one night at Candice’s Airbnb went better than expected. First of all, this Airbnb was the only location that could accommodate more than 4 people in a 30 minute radius of Geneva College, we traveled with 8 people, including a baby. Candice had baby toys ( bouncer & play pen) which was really nice.
Candice accommodated an early check-in, had items labeled for easy access and decorations in the home were beautiful. Candice maintained communication with me which was very helpful. There were also a variety of toiletries in the bathroom, snacks in the fridge/kitchen and a many pillows & blankets ,which were comfortable :). I definitely recommend this location for others and would return if ever back in the area."

She was extremely responsive and accommodating before check in and during check out. She also prepared the air mattress before check-in, which was such a help due to our late night arrival. We were so comfortable and felt right at home. Thanks for a fantastic stay!"

Group trip","Candice is a fabulous host! Couldn’t have been more responsive and willing to help in any way possible. The place is gorgeous and exactly as described. We were in the second floor apartment and the setup was ideal for everything being on the same floor. It’s a long apartment with a large living space in the front and the bedrooms all the way on the opposite end with the bathroom and kitchen in between, so none of the noise from the living space bled into the bedrooms. There are also room darkening curtains, in case you need to sleep during the day at all. Great stay all around! Would definitely stay again the next time we’re in the area!"

Stayed a few nights","We needed a place to stay for a family wedding and Candice’s place was perfect! From the location close to the venue to all of the amenities she provided it was a perfect match. The apartment was spotless, the towels and linens were luxurious. She had little surprises like snacks and drinks, as well as travel size toiletries in the bathroom in case you forget something. Of course, we had forgotten our toothbrushes! Couch was comfy and the BIG television with ROKU was perfect for movie watching. The master king size bed was so comfortable after two long nights and there is no lack of pillows! While there were only two of us traveling, we did not take advantage of the full size dining table or the second bedroom with two sets of bunks, making this perfect for families. I saw many board games and toys as well! She has thought of everything a guest could want or need! Met her in person and she was just charming! Would stay here again for sure! HIGHLY recommend!"

They went above and beyond to have a high chair and etc for my baby. They had a bunch of toys that our daughters loved. They had snacks, drinks, coffee, literally anything you could think of. They had there bathroom stocked with travel size things in case you needed them. The host was also very lovely! I highly recommend and we will be staying here for future competitions!"

It was very clean, even spotless. There were a variety of comfortable beds to choose from- which is a plus for picky sleepers like me. The host went out of the way to accommodate my kids- toys, high chair, bumper, etc. My kids felt comfortable there and got right to playing. The TV is ginormous. The couch was really big and comfortable. The shower/bathroom was spotless with travel sizes toiletries in case you forget something. Great place to crash if you're visiting the area or driving through. It has a few of those plug-in air fresheners if you like that kind of thing (I'm not a fan but I just unplug them and put them back when we leave). I would def stay here again next time."

Stayed a few nights","Very close to Westminister College which is why we choose this very clean unit. Owners were close if needed, but never interfered with our stay. The unit was small but just right for us since it was just my wife and I and our older Grand Daughter who is an incoming student.
This spot was very clean and had everything we needed for our two-night stay. We usually travel with the whole family so this unit would not accommodate our large group, BUT if it's just my wife and I we would very much stay at this location again. It's warm, and comfortable for a small group of 5 or less.
Highly recommend!!!!!"

Stayed one night","The first word that comes to mind about this airbnb is orderly. Even the shampoo/conditioner/wash were lined up perfectly on the shelf in the shower. Very clean. I've stayed in a few musty spaces, lipstick on a pig places on this trip with photos straight out of the real estate playbook, but Ken & Arianna's place is not one of them. I think it looked better in person than the photos. Also, despite being connected to the house, it was rather peaceful and if you open the window, you can hear plenty of clip clop from the Amish buggies during daylight hours. Only occasional garage door opening noise. I prefer a checkout at 11am instead of 10am, but I didn't request it and the hosts say you can do so with lead time. Would stay again."

We happened upon the once a year Witches Night Out event in a near by town and experienced our first Amish donuts!

Helped for local spots and convient to everything, when I go to Pittsburgh in future for other runs I will book here just because it was comfortable, friendly people and good area for eats and so much more. Affordable as well, thanks we appreciated the home feel."

Their place was perfect, super comfortable bed, great shower, nice kitchen with stove, refrigerator, and microwave and we found it easily off of I-80W, even at the late hour we arrived, which they took in stride😊
Very quiet area and it was super easy to hop back onto I-80W in the morning.
We would stay at this apartment again if in the area!"

You may have to drive behind a buggy or two, but just relax and enjoy the beautiful surroundings. It’s a refreshing alternative to the hotels on I-80 and I hope to stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I traveled from Virginia and stayed two nights at Arianna's and Ken's Private Above Garage Studio Apartment in New Wilmington, PA in August 2021. It was such a great location for us to be able to attend a family reunion and visit with a family member in the Shenango Presbyterian Senior Care Center! The apartment was very clean and pleasant and located in a quiet neighborhood close to down town New Wilmington. We love the country fresh air and although there was air conditioning, we so enjoyed relaxing on the sofa in front of the open windows and hearing an occasional clip clop of horse hoofs from the Amish horse and buggies and also the chimes of the church bells. It was like stepping back in time! The private back entrance with locking keypad made for easy and secure access. Arianna and Ken were great communicators and hosts. We would definitely stay here again if we are back in the area."

We stayed with my parents and my children for the solar eclipse of 2024 - everyone had a fantastic time. The kids loved all the toys, games, and huge cozy couch for movie cuddles. I had forgotten my deodorant (😬), and *voila* there was a plethora of travel-sized toiletries to use if needed. You didn’t want for anything at this lovely home! I had the pleasure of meeting Candice & Dave while we were there and they were both incredibly welcoming & kind. We are planning on coming back next Summer and wouldn’t consider staying ANYWHERE else. Thank you Candice & Dave!! 😊"

Candice confirmed that the Ladies of the Dukes is still up and running on Sundays and it’s only a few blocks away. Unfortunately we had to leave on Saturday. I haven’t been there for 20+ years and I plan on making the trip on a Sunday morning for nostalgic reasons but also because the meatballs and sauce are amazing. Candice keeps this place spotless. I mean really spotless. She also thinks of every little thing you might need like every type of toiletry, feminine products, etc. You know you are dealing with a good host when you see this. Overall it is a great place to stay if you need to be in the New Castle area. We hiked McConell’s Mill State Park which was maybe 15 minutes drive."

There were even feminine products available. The light switches were labelled so you did not have to figure out which one was where. The outside games were so fun, my kids had a blast! She had extension cords set up to make it convenient to charge your phone. Little ledges for your phone set up by all of the beds. She even had phone chargers both android and iphone plugged in and ready to go upon arrival. We were greeted with snacks and a very well put together book of local suggestions for things to do, sights to see, and places to eat. The home was decorated with care, I did not feel like it was random furniture put into the home to make it look full as they do at many airbnbs. We absolutely loved this stay. There is not a single thing I could say against it. Wish we could have stayed longer! Thank you!!"

Great walking options around town. Look for Jeff and Melinda's love lock on the bridge fence behind Shop and Save. Don't forget your own lock to pace on the bridge.
The most unique feature of the house is the lodge, complete with Dennis the stuffed deer head (who has a great smile and looks like the coach from Rudolph the Red nosed Reindeer) and Pete, the styrofoam polar bear head (don't ask. Mel had to name them). The lodge has a treehouse view over the gorge behind the house and gives the place a surreal feeling.
Not much else to say. The host was very accommodating, beds comfy, bathroom good. I don't think it would be good for wheelchair bound, but otherwise a great place, well worth the stay."

This is the second trip for me and my husband, and we both enjoy simply relaxing and kicking back for a few days. Thank you Robert and Maggie for your hospitality, and for being a wonderful people and hosts. We're looking forward to our third stay."

Scenic, peaceful view from the back private patio. Even a coffee pot with coffee -- can't beat it! Not to mention, the host, Robert, was very responsive and helpful in every way. Who knew that in all our years of traveling around the world, we'd have one of our best experiences right here in Ellwood City. Already looking forward to next time."

There was a creek in the Backyard where we were greeted by two deers while sitting on the patio relaxing, it was cool though of course they mean no harm. they were probably more afraid of us then we were of them. The house is very clean and maintained, equipped with everything for your stay. I only had one issue opening the door and Robert answered for help right away. It was Perfect!"

Stayed a few nights","This home is a wonderful, quiet place to stay when in the area. It is so comfortable and well equipped. I loved the patio and the ability to enjoy the outside while I was there. We had everything we needed to enjoy a quiet, relaxing time.
A couple notes for future guests:
Please note there is a step down then up to get into the dining room, and then 2 steps down to the lodge. This wasn't an issue for us, but if someone has difficulty with mobility, those steps could be an issue.
The home is located in a very quiet neighborhood, and the home is very close to both neighbors on each side. One neighbor from across the street was extremely friendly to us and came over to talk. But many of the neighbors just stared at us, even if we waved. So please be aware that there may be some people who may not be too happy that this home is an airbnb. We were very quiet and respectful while staying there, but if you want to be loud, this is not the place for you!"

It exceeded all my expectations
It’s the perfect place for someone wanting to get away from it all or simply rest when you get back from visiting relatives or friends
It’s setting, a wooded backyard overlooking the Connoquenessing river.
Small animals abound. Rabbits squirrels birds surround you
You enjoy these were sitting on a 20 x 30 porch with wonderful cushion chairs and couch and a dinette
Inside you’ll find a well-equipped kitchen with a new stove and refrigerator .a Very comfortable bed and to great seating areas
Too smart TVs, plenty of outlets for all your electronic gadgets, And a great location close to everything un Ellwood and Less than 30 minutes to nearby attractions like state park"

It is a quiet, peaceful setting with a beautiful nature view at the back of the house. The house is in a neighborhood, but from the large windows at the back of the house it feels like a house in the woods.
There was literally nothing we needed. Robert's instructions for checking in were easy to follow. Everything was easy to find. There were some books to read, a nice chess set, relaxing home-away-from-home feel. Morning coffee in ""the lodge"" while watching birds was my favorite."

I chose this home for its location which is only about 30 minutes from Moraine State Park and McConnell's Mill - a photographer's dream (wild flowers were out in force this week!) and also great for hiking, boating, fishing, and bicycling. It is also well-situated for a day trip to Erie if one wished, or to Grove City Outlets, and an excursion into the city of Pittsburgh. I hope to stay again some time in the future."

I didn't get it when we booked but the place actually was a carriage house at one point. It sits right behind the main house. The garage doors (there are three) are all about the size of a carriage (not a car). Parking was easy. The owners were very responsive to requests. The place is basically a one room apartment (above the carriage area. When you enter, you do have to climb a very steep stairwell. Both the bed and the roll out were comfortable. The living room area is nice - the couch and chairs look good and are super easy to lounge in. There is a pizza place across the street that is decent. A coffee shop, bar, and Rite Aid are literally steps away. Very nice and very comfortable place. We will be back!!!!!"

He also responded quickly when the internet was not working but he was not able to fix it. Having no internet made our stay very frustrating and difficult (we could not watch movies or do any Black Friday shopping). It would have been helpful to have recommendations about where to eat and what to do in the town (or nearby areas). It was OK but surprising that we had to take out the trash when we left.

Stayed a few nights","Upon learning the date for our granddaughter's graduation from Westminster College, we quickly rented the Carriage House apartment (along with 3 rooms at the Inn - about a 40 foot walk from the Carriage House via the shared courtyard lawn) to attend her graduation ceremony this May.
The Carriage House (and Inn) is centrally located and an easy walk to the campus and the local microbrewery/hard seltzer/micro winery. New Wilmington is a tiny, pretty town - restaurants are few and casual .
We loved the Carriage House accommodations - furnishings were comfy and bathrooms were nicely updated. Everything was spotless.
Angel and Brian were tremendous hosts - so friendly, welcoming, and engaging.
We highly recommend the Carriage House, we could not have asked for better accommodations and hosts."

Stayed a few nights","Our stay in this one-bedroom apartment was absolutely wonderful! We felt very comfortable during our three-day stay and enjoyed spending time in the apartment. Both the interior and the exterior are beautifully decorated. Our daughter attends Westminster College, and we were able to spend quality time with her during our stay. When she visited the apartment, we spent time in the family room, kitchen, and even ate dinner around the kitchen table, everything was very cozy, like home - but away from home. We live 5+ hours away so this was perfect. The apartment is very clean and impeccably furnished, the kitchen is well-equipped with everything you need. We have stayed with Brian and Angel in the past, they are the most amazing hosts. They also respond promptly when you have any questions and check-in to make sure you have what you need. We look forward to our next visit, we will definitely stay in this apartment again!"

It is clean and furnished with very cozy furniture. It also has a nice kitchen area which is well supplied and a living room with natural lighting from the bank of windows which overlook a beautiful church and a view of the campus. We were in between homes in our move from North Carolina to eastern Ohio and the carriage house was a perfect place to spend Christmas. Angel and Brian are very welcoming and hospitable.

Stayed with kids","Jason was an awesome host!! The cabin is amazing and the attention to detail is seen and felt throughout. We have stayed in our fair share of rentals and this was by far the cleanest (I’d go so far as to say immaculate) place we have ever rented. The craftsmanship of the home can be seen with every detail and the perfection with which the home was built is the same perfection with which Jason welcomes his guests. So many details are overlooked with rentals these days but not at the cabin. From a well thought out welcome packet outlining any question a renter may have, to the small, tactful labeling of light fixtures allowing one to know which fixture operates which set of lights, there seems to be nothing Jason hasn’t thought of. I cannot say enough about the cleanliness and obvious attention to detail that is put into this space. It is serene and peaceful, yet close enough to great outdoor activities and all Pittsburgh has to offer. Hope to be in the area to stay again. 10 out of 10!"

Stayed a few nights","We stayed at Jason’s cottage for the first 4 nights of our trip to see family, then had plans to stay at another airbnb closer to my family’s house for the last 3 nights of the trip. We left Jason’s Monday morning and got to the other Airbnb, whose listing was misleading and found that it was not clean and smelled very bad of horse manure. I didn’t feel comfortable staying there, so we checked to see if Jason’s place was still available, and it was! We booked it out of there so fast and came right back to Jason’s place where we felt at home! We were so relieved to be back, and Jason was so welcoming and kind. You will not find a cleaner place than this, and the beautiful serene atmosphere is icing on the cake. Loved how close to hiking and state parks this is as well. We will definitely be staying here the next time we come out to visit family!"

The cabin was perfect! An easy drive to campus but also close to Pittsburgh, we were very comfortable and had a great time around the fire pit, down at the river, and playing games in the spacious living area. The rooms are beautifully decorated and well-stocked yet we were not nervous about having three small children with us…it just felt homey and welcoming. As you can read in other reviews, there is a lot of noise from the road as well as between floors, but this really didn’t bother us. It was more than worth it to be together in such a beautiful, cozy, fun place. Anita was responsive and helpful! Note: drive the 9 minutes south to May’s Donuts, you won’t be sorry!!"

Stayed a few nights","Slippery Rock Cabin was one of my top Air BnB experiences. The cabin is VERY clean, extremely comfortable bedding, soft towels, and everything you would need. Anita and her family thought of the smallest details that made a big difference, e.g. cotton rounds, tissues, and Q tips in the bathrooms, a completely stocked kitchen, snacks out to welcome us, and wood for the fireplace ready to go. It felt like we were real guests at their home. While the cabin itself is a treasure, the property makes you feel like you're in a movie scene - a beautiful lighted deck leads to your own woods and Slippery Rock Creek view. Very peaceful and beautiful. This cabin is minutes from McConnells Mill State Park - which is a must see if you're staying here. Thank you, Anita and Bill! We hope to be back!"

Owners had tons of games and little extras in every room. There were 8 of us and it was so nice that everyone had a comfy bed to sleep in and plenty of room to move around. If you’re looking for a place to hang out and relax with all the comforts of home then we highly recommend staying here. Thank you for our fantastic family weekend getaway! Can’t wait until next time!

The cabin is very relaxing and the views and sounds of Slippery Rock creek are beautiful. The beds are extremely comfortable and you will have all of the amenities you need. Our pups also enjoyed their stay and hike at McConnells Mill which is only 5 minutes away. Overall, our group highly recommends and we intend on visiting again this summer."

Even visiting in the cold of January, there is much to explore snd enjoy at the water’s edge and surrounding community area. The hosts put extreme effort into making the home welcoming and full of many treats. The hosts let you enjoy the peace of the cabin but are also very quick to reply to any communications.

We wanted something comfortable and cozy for her and us. This house was so warm and cozy. It felt better than being home. Our host had everything we needed at the house down to extra tooth brushes. She was really gracious and kind and showed us were everything was and how everything worked. She gave us a welcome packet that included places to see, eat and discover. Check in was on time and so was check out and her response is immediate. Our only complaint is that we'd wish we could of stayed longer!! 😄"

Stayed with kids","Rainbow bend was a perfect family weekend for us. Plenty of space in the cabin for the kids to play and handy to have the smart TV with streaming services available for downtime for them. Decor is a rustic cabin vibe with lots of vintage items and hunting memorabilia displayed (which is perfect for my kids). Water was too high due to recent rains for good fishing with the kids along the nearby river off the dock (inevitable this time of year) but the nearby fly shop pointed us to a more fishable area with preschoolers. (The river would have been ok for fishing without small children at this flow). But the best part was the feeder creek through the property with lots of salamanders. Finding salamanders and crayfish is one of our kids' top activities and this was a wonderland for them. The hillsides are very steep, but doable if you're willing to get a little dirty. Overall, cabin was clean and comfortable but the creek made our trip!"

Stayed a few nights","Very cool place inside. Great private location. Lots of wildlife roaming around. Host was responsive and friendly. The creek isn’t super accessible if you have bad knees or any mobility issues. It’s a very steep, slippery climb down some old crumbling railroad tie steps. Make sure you test each step before putting your weight on it. Same with the deck steps. Pictures make it look like it’s right on the water. It’s not. We planned to grill dinner based on the listing of a grill available and the picture of the grill on the deck. Unfortunately it was nasty, unusable, and rusted with a big rodent nest inside it. The kitchen had everything we needed to adjust though, including a nice set of seasoned cast iron skillets. The steaks still turned out good. It wasn’t the “grill on a creek side deck with a water view” that we expected based on the pictures and description but still a very interesting, private place to stay."

Stayed with kids","we stayed here last year and had a wonderful family bonding vacation. last year, we played a board game there and planned to play it this year. When we got home late the first full night, we wanted to play the game. we couldn't find it. I reached out to Matthew seeing if he knew where it may be, thinking he'd reply the next day, but instead replied right back. Come to find out his son took the game. Matthew suggested playing a different game that night and offered to bring the other game over at lunchtime the next day. I was NOT expecting him to do that for a board game. but he did.
Our family is already excited to return next year.
If you do stay, make sure you make a fire it warms the home up so much and is so beautiful.
The Xbox was also a hit for the boys.
the only thing that we saw different, and for the better is the door lock is keyless, we didn't know how to lock the door at first. to lock it press the Brink button. Notes are still for a KEY lock. :)"

Was dried on the microwave turntable. The scratchers and dish wands in the sink were old, dirty and sour smelling. Spider webs around the door entrance. Not very inviting.
Over all we were able to rest and relax (what we came to do). Our First impression, too much clutter for an air B&B."

But more than that, it’s such a beautiful and interesting space. It’s like staying in a cozy, homey museum because there are so many curiosities and interesting artifacts. The property is absolutely breathtaking. The creek is right there. You can easily sit on the deck and listen to it and watch the sun glint off the water. You can also walk down the hill to a dock and sit right next to it. The walk down to the dock is steep and might not be great in wet or icy weather but it was fine for us.

Stayed with kids","What a wonderful stay we had at the cabin. It had rained, snowed, and was a little wet outside during our stay but the cabin was warm and comfortable inside. It felt inviting and cozy. The highlight was finding an old chess board in the closet and the entire family playing each other over our entire stay while having the fireplace roaring in the back.
The boys were excited to find a game system hooked up to the living room TV.
On this vacation, this was stop 4 for us and the master bed was such a refreshing comfort on my body; super soft.
If you are staying on a Saturday check out one of my favorite spots at, ""donuts on Saturday"" that the Amish make. I was so excited to find out the cabin was less than 15 mins away from their home.
We were concerned about how tight the driveway was going to be to turn around, but there is plenty of room to turn your car around safely.
I reached out to Matthew a couple of times and he was very responsive.
Water was Beautiful. Will Return For Sure."

The dock down by the river is so picturesque. It was a really warm weekend so we didn’t try the stove but if we had been stuck inside all weekend due to weather, we wouldn’t have minded at all because it was such a nice space! Easy drive to Volant which has adorable shops and New Wilmington where Westminster college is. Also only 20 min to McConnells Mills State Park. The place was really well stocked, very comfortable. Would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","Most unique home we've stayed in. Fascinating books from guitars, birds, rugs, fishing, photography... you're bound to find something fascinating in the hundreds of books. There's a smaller creek to one side which feeds into a bigger river. The house is such a solid log cabin build it is wonderfully quiet, but you can open a window or door to hear the rushing water. It is an official Audubon wildlife, bird and butterfly sanctuary. The leather couches are super soft and the kitchen is fully stocked (spice rack, pantry items). The main bed is a bit creaky getting in, but comfortable throughout the night. Water is hot and strong.
If you're looking for a pristine hotel room this is not it. Every nook and cranny has an interesting object (arrowheads, fishing flies, brass antiques, artwork, stained glass, rugs, antler chandelier) to explore. It's more like you're visiting a multi-faceted, learned uncle and he's been collecting his whole life.
The house is older, but you can tell the quality materials throughout. In the shady and wet environment, the deck could use a good power wash and some new furnishings. All these objects probably require constant dusting, so not for allergy sufferers.
A short drive to historic Volant or Newcastle, but feels like a million miles away."

Stayed with kids",Matthew’s place is gorgeous with a nice view and rustic feel. We had family visit during our stay and they raved about how beautiful it is inside. It’s bigger than the pictures. The water is a one minute walk down dirt/ built in railroad tie steps with a small dock at the bottom. The upstairs is a loft style with a lower railing overlooking the living room so if you have little ones that is good to keep in mind as that could be risky. It’s super quiet and relaxing with all the essentials of home. Matthew responded quickly to any questions we had and was a wonderful host.

It is also stocked with everything you need (from cleaning to cooking) which was perfect. I stayed here with a few friends and we also went to Mines and Meadows ATV park- for anyone coming with trailers, the driveway is very difficult to back down because of the location but it was manageable.

The decks were their own ecosystem.🤗 we cooked in the kitchen which was well supplied to produce great meals. The path to the creek was a reversion to childhood. We learned quickly to bring a flashlight for the trip back up! We would love to experience the cabin in another season, because even in February it was a Haven. Thank-you for sharing your cabin that exudes love, comfort, and acceptance. We would like to know the story behind “ no mantle hanging”.

Large living spaces, a short walk to the creek for water fun and fishing, and within short driving distance of outlet shopping, hiking, and shops/antiquing around Volant; also the many attractions of Pittsburgh for a slightly longer drive. Matthew is very attentive to messages, but also leaves you alone to enjoy the place. Great place to stay for a few days before dropping off one of our sons at a local college."

Group trip","The house has so much history and it’s like walking in a museum. Pretty great. I was pretty excited to be here as well, But practically, It’s an average experience.. It’s true you can connect with nature coz it’s surrounded by a lot of trees etc. however if you are expecting a water overlook that’s not how it is although the description says so. There is a little deck when you walk down about 50 stairs but then again you still have to have a ladder (provided) to climb down. Water isn’t clean enough to dive in.
And the house deck needs a lot of upkeep work that’s due. And house is a legacy (I get that) but it’s not the most comfortable when it comes to bathrooms and bedroom arrangements. Again this is my view coz I enjoy comfort. But I guess if you are looking for some hikes or fishing, you might enjoy this outdoor activities. It’s definitely that but not so much a house view a nice relaxing view. ."

Stayed one night","Great price, safe residential neighborhood and off street parking. Accurate to the listing. Good for overnight or two. Appeared to be clean, no smells! The futon couch which is intended for another bed is very uncomfortable for sleeping. For a couch it was ok. Would have been nice to have either room darkening blinds or curtains. Kitchenette is adequate! Wouldn't want to fix a Thanksgiving dinner in it! Shower is very small, but great water flow and good and hot. Ton's of towels. The Amazon LG flat screen is a pain to use. Very slow internet also. Could use better ceiling lighting and a ceiling fan would help circulate the old electric baseboard heating (3). It was very cold when we arrived, but in an hour it warmed up. Ample sheets and blankets could use some more bed pillows for the bed and futon. All in all for our purposes it was fine. Nice host."

Stayed over a week","The stay at Christina's AirBnB was a very lovely experience. There were minimal downsides and a few nice surprises. One surprise was that we thought there was only a fridge, but the fridge has an included freezer box on the inside. The AirBnB was very cute and cozy. It had way more storage in the closets than expected. There were multiple ways to control the temperature inside the AirBnB (there was a learning curve, but then it was simple). We had some family issues come up and she was very flexible about our arrival/checkout. Things to be aware of are: the shower is extremely tiny, the futon isn't the most comfortable but it works, and the walls are very thin. You will hear traffic, voices, etc. But we felt these downsides were not enough to lower the rating beneath 5 stars. Christina was, herself, very responsive and made it an easy stay. Overall, her description of ""charming"" sums up her listing quite well. We would love to stay again some day in the future."

we spent the weekend racing at Pittsburgh Raceway and this was the perfect spot to hang out, rest and sleep. It is a small efficiency but it has everything you need to be comfortable while checking out the local shops, restaurants or like us go to the races.
Note: the bed is super comfortable.
The area is quiet and you are right near downtown Ellwood which is a nice stroll to check shops out, coffee, bakery or a meadery.
It is small but given the area, the cost, the amenities (internet works great) I would say it was worth it and we will probably try to reserve it for future races in the area."

The space is exactly as described and pictured. It felt and smelled clean and comfortable. The bed was comfortable but full sized, which was cramped for me and my very tall fiance! Totally my fault for overlooking this in the description.
Christina clearly takes pride in her space! I would definitely suggest this to anyone wanting quiet, cozy time."

Very comfortable, clean, easy open-floor plan layout inside. Loved the big L-couch, great for hanging out. We cooked a lot all weekend, the kitchen was perfect. A couple other visiting family members joined us for meals, lots of room for that. The eating area opens to the porch, so inside/outside gathering was easy. We couldn’t get enough of porch view, rain or shine (with a rainbow over the valley during the day and northern lights at night!). New fire pit which we’ll try out next time. Gina was our host contact, so kind and helpful and very prompt. This is a wonderful find for multiple guests. I highly recommend it, we hope to be back!"

The porch is larger in person than it looks in the photos. The WiFi was fast enough to work from if that is one of your concerns.

Stayed a few nights","We came to Western PA for the funeral of a beloved family member. We needed a place to be when we weren’t at celebration of life activities. This house was absolutely perfect. Because the death was sudden and we were in a hurry to travel, obviously, we forgot to pack a few things. The house had literally everything I needed. The pictures online looked amazing. But the house in person looks even more remarkable. There is an extreme attention to detail and comfort in the home. Gina even had it decorated for Christmas, which was very nice since we had to be away from home the weekend before Christmas, both she and Ed were incredibly responsive.
Since this is called Amish Paradise, I will mention how interesting it was to learn more about the Amish community, to see them living without electricity, and traveling by horse and cart. The view from the side porch was amazing. We also enjoyed visiting Apple Castle and Cheese House.
This will be our homebase from now on when we visit family."

Stayed a few nights","This home is such a gem! The home smells beautiful and was decorated in a lovely manner for the holiday. It is a delight to hear Amish buggies come down the road and to be surrounded by great nature. Peace and quiet abounds, and you can’t beat the beautiful field views out the windows. The beds were very comfortable. The hosts were very friendly and helpful. This was our second visit, and we’d certainly come back."

The communication was excellent and the hosts were accommodating.
We would definitely stay there again.
We used the fire pit, and that was a nice extra, along with the beautiful porch.
BTW, this time of year in this area is so beautiful with the changing of the colors of the leaves. Saw several horse and buggies drive by. . ."

Group trip","Ed and Gina's place was perfect for our family get-away this year. The house was very clean and decorated so cute for fall. When we walked in, you immediately felt at home. The view from the porch is breathtaking. We spent a lot of time out there enjoying coffee and watching the sunrise and sunset. It was very peaceful and so relaxing. Ed and Gina communicated well, always getting back to us quickly when we had any questions. The house was in a great location, we were able to visit the local Amish Shops and Volant, The Grove City Outlets, and we drove into Ohio to do some shopping. We recommend Apple Castle, Manginos Pizzeria, Byler's Quilt Shop, and Anna's Baked Goods. We got complimentary donuts from Gina and Ed, which were so delicious and such a great treat. We would definitely stay again if we come back to the area. Thanks Ed and Gina for letting our family make memories in your beautiful house."

Our favorite part was having coffee on the porch overlooking the farms, relaxing on the great outdoor furniture, and listening to the horse & buggies drive by. Ed and Gina were fantastic at responding to our needs and helping us with places to eat and visit. I can't recommend this place enough! And did I mention the view!?!?!?"

Stayed about a week","We had a wonderful stay at the farmhouse. the wrap around porch is amazing with a spectacular view of the rolling Pennsylvania hills. We have extended family that lives in the area and it was a great location for sitting on the porch with them, and using the BBQ grill which our hosts had left well equipped for us. The beds are comfortable and the living room has a good sized couch. Be aware that the beautiful kitchen does not have a dishwasher. We did a fair amount of cooking while we were there so this took a little more time. We look forward to staying there again."

We had done a day trip of several waterfalls in the area and needed a 1 night stay (Not many will do that, but we so appreciated that Ed and Gina would!) We played games and watched a movie and then were about our business again the next day. The house was welcoming, clean, and it had a beautiful view of quiet farm surroundings.

Our adult kids hung out there and stayed up to watch the sunset. If you’re lucky enough to stay on a Friday or Saturday, you really must go down the road a bit to the Amish farmhouse called Anna’s Baked Goods. Oh.My.God.

The downstairs was spacious and open so we could all be together even in different rooms. The bedrooms were perfect for our family and the bed was very comfortable! We also enjoyed visiting the park that was located very close to the house. We hope to be able to stay here again in the future!

The home is a beautiful space that is well thought out and comes with all the necessary amenities. 7 adults stayed very comfortably in the house. The home is just 2 minutes from Anna’s baked goods… if you’re looking for Amish homemade sweets, this is the place to stop. Gina and Ed are extremely fast to respond and provided us with the best in class experience. Thank you so much."

We sat on the porch and drank coffee, and hiked at McConnell’s Mill State park.

Kitchen is well stocked with any essential you may need :) Beds are comfy and we loved the extra large shower too! Wraparound porch is amazing and we had a beautiful sunrise our last day! It was chilly when we stayed so we didn't get out to the firepit but it is the perfect area to do some stargazing! Maybe next time!! I would not hesitate to recommend staying at Amish Paradise and I hope to do the same when we come back to the area...Thank you Ed and Gina for your wonderful hospitality😊

Stayed with kids","Ed and Gina were AMAZING hosts. We felt we had a million and one questions for them and they never grew impatient with us. We had a family of six (seven with Grandma for a few days) for nearly ten days total. Ed and Gina were two houses down and treated us like family. They emptied our trash utility can when we missed curbside pickup, they bought a new fire pit while we were there and plenty of firewood so we could enjoy nights under the stars, they ensured we always had fresh drinking water on hand, they washed our linens and towels while we were there..truly above and beyond! They were very gregarious and generous and accommodating to our little ones as well. Do your best to respect their home and they will in turn be respectful of you!
About the home.. amazing! Far away from Pittsburgh that you feel out of the city but close enough for a day trip. Cozy bed and bedrooms, family sized couch, high pressure shower, and a welcoming kitchen and table for home cooked meals. Look no further for a home away from home :)"

We loved the comfy furniture, decorations and amenities. There were plenty of quality linens and a nice, hot shower with good water pressure. There are some condiments in the fridge and a Keurig with a few coffee & tea options, so as long as you bring your own food, you will have everything you need! Thanks for a great stay, Patti!"

We immediately felt comfortable making ourselves at home for the weekend. Everything is as described. You can tell a lot of thought and care has been put into the decor and amenities. No TVs in the bedrooms but the WiFi works fine for ipads/laptops. It’s important to note that the suite is attached to the main house so you can hear house sounds. It wasn’t disruptive, just something we hadn’t thought about when booking. This was a perfect location for us with close proximity to a delicious dinner at Talbots, a Saturday stroll through Volant, and a chilly afternoon football game. If visiting the college, I would strongly prefer this location over the 2.5 star hotels near the outlets. Thank you!!"

The only issue was that the home was freezing. It was 45 degrees outside and the bedrooms were ice cold and there was no heat.
My husband and I had to sleep on the floor in the living room near the space heater (faux fireplace). We didn’t realize it was that cold in the bedrooms until late at night and dressed for bed. We never wrote the hosts (but wish we had). The house got colder and colder as the night went on. If you stay here, just make sure the heat is on, if it’s cold outside."

Patti's space is very comfortable, and filled with many extra, caring touches. You can feel her warmth and thoughtfulness throughout the entire space, I immediately felt relaxed upon arrival. The kitchen is well equipped, the shower has great water pressure, the couches and the beds are very comfy- all things making it feel just like home. Patti is a wonderful and gracious hostess- there to answer any question you may have or to chat with if you would like. She went above and beyond for my stay making sure I had pillows that would work well with my bad neck, which was so greatly appreciated. It is kindness like this that show why she is a Superhost and that she truly cares about her guests and their comfort.
The location is very convenient to area colleges/universities and shopping and at the same time gives you a feel for true Amish country, if you've never experienced it before. You cannot go wrong booking at Safe Haven. I highly recommend and would give more than 5 stars if I could! I am looking forward to my next stay to relax and recharge! Thank you again, Patti!"

The only thing I’d point out is the steps to the basement apartment are a little steep. Some people need to know that. It wouldn’t prevent me from returning though! Wonderful experience!"

Stayed a few nights","Great place in a quiet town in western PA. We stayed here at Christmas time, and the unit was festooned with holiday decorations and lights that were fun and tasteful.
The basics: everything was very clean - carpets, towels, bed linens, etc. There were enough bath and bed linens to keep us warm and clean. Soap and shampoo are provided. The heating, plumbing, and electricity all worked fine. There is enough parking space for 1 car and parking is free. The hosts mentioned in the listing that the WI-FI is spotty. This is true; it was not working during our stay. This is due to the location. I was able to use my hotspot for internet access.
The unit is a basement apartment in the house - not the whole house. To get into it you have to go down a flight of stairs, so if you have trouble with stairs, this is not the place for you.
It's located in a rural part of Lawrence County, so dining and grocery options are limited. There are a few places is New Wilmington and nearby Volant, but otherwise you need to go to New Castle or Hermitage. Pittsburgh is an hour away. This place really is a retreat! It's very quiet here, which is exactly what we came for."

Stayed a few nights","We were so very pleased with our stay- it far exceeded our expectations for what we needed! Myself, my husband and teen son needed to stay in New Wilmington for our son's wedding at the Irons Mill Farmstead and everything that we needed for the weekend was met by this lovely garden 2 bedroom, roomy one bath apartment and host. Having the ironing board & iron available was a huge help with dressing for the wedding. Plenty of fridge space & kitchen space for our cookies for the Pittsburgh Cookie Table which would have been a huge issue staying in a hotel. We loved the decor, very tasteful, we especially liked the coffee beans used as decor in the kitchen, very cute. The bedrooms were roomy with plenty of closet space and very tastefully decorated in calming colors and lovely accents, the beds were very comfy, the shower hot and full power and the games in the cupboard were fun! We plan to buy a toss- a-cross for the winter blues!! A very large flat screen TV with DVD movies we liked, Plenty of breakfast drink choices, paper products, lovely dishes and everything available to cook up a great meal. What a blessing it was to find this special home, 9 minute easy drive to the venue and great nights of sleep with comfy space for relaxing and dressing made what could have been stress into a smooth sail!! Having control settings for the temperature of the rental area would have been helpful but when I called about it they were right on it and it was cooled down within minutes so it really was not an issue. Plenty of parking space and the home is on the end of the street in complete privacy with a lovely yard & grounds overlooking amish farms and cornfields- sat out in the early morning in my pajamas watching the sun come up with a cup of tasty coffee in hand. Hope to some day be back again as we felt right at home and very welcomed."

The family hosting the place is AMAZING. Their communication was above and beyond, the place was VERY clean and the decoration was the warm touch to make you feel like you were actually home. Joey helped me unload my vehicle and gave me the tour of the place.
I worked in the area and it was perfect because it was not too far from many large highways. The amish community was an awesome touch and added the small town experience. The town was welcoming and made friends in the few days I was there!! There are multiple breweries and food restaurants within 15 minutes from the home which were delicious. ( Recommend 32 brewery and the crane room. )
The home was perfect for a long or short term stay because they all the amenities that you would need (even EXTRA ones too; coffee, soap, cooking utensils and supplies). There is a washer and dryer available but it is shared with the family in their house. (they let you do laundry anytime and even shared their detergent when I forgot mine) The only complaint I have is that the airbnb location is in the family's basement (does not feel or even smell like one) BUT you can hear them upstairs talking, watching tv and playing the drums. Although that should be expected while sharing a home with another family I suppose.
Overall, I would highly recommend this home and if in the area, I will definitely be staying again! Joey and Patti are a dream host and make anyone feel welcome in their home."

Stayed a few nights","Our stay in Patti’s home was comfortable and pleasant. The town and area of New Wilmington are pretty and Patti's home is attractive. Patti was quick to communicate with us and was eager to please. She also graciously allowed us a late check out, which we really appreciated. The only downside was that the wifi did not work well for us, although Patty tried to remedy it. Also, her place was difficult to find even after following instructions to first go to Westminster College and then route ourselves from there. Our GPS took us to a neighbor across large fields, and it was not easy or straightforward, as it would seem, to get around those fields to her home. This was probably in part because it was dark. I wouldn't mention this if other guests hadn't also had trouble finding it. If you're arriving at night, you really don't want to feel lost. So, I suggest you ask Patty for directions and not rely on your GPS."

When I was still searching for a place to stay, I wrote her and she responded within the hour. She then invited us to stay. After I booked, Patti promptly wrote and told me to let her know what my expected arrival time would be so that she could meet, give me the key, and give a little tour. I didn't read everything, or else I would have known that my GPS was going to send me to a field, but when I wrote in a sort of panic she immediately sent her number for me to contact her. I managed to find it as New Wilmington isn't huge, but she was so prompt. When we arrived she came running out to see if we were ok. We parked out 24 foot trailer at her place, as she had previously said we could. There was plenty of room and Patti was beyond gracious. The place is immaculate, the town is quaint, and I couldn't have asked for a better time. I will return, if just to see Patti again."
