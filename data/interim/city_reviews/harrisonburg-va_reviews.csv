Stayed a few nights","Great place to stay on their farm. Quiet, comfortable, plenty of space and feels like home. I enjoyed the country setting being right on the edge of Harrisonburg. Easy location and nicely furnished. Full kitchen area if you want to cook, which we did plenty of room for us and my kids came over to eat dinner with us.
They have a little toy box for kids. Some games and a puzzle if you just want to relax inside. This was my second stay and would stay again!!"

We bought some steaks from the barn and they were amazing!!! Plus seeing all the cows and the beautiful countryside was a plus! Everything was so clean and nice. We where worried that there would be a lot of noise because it’s a downstairs apartment but you would of never known anyone was home!

Stayed a few nights","As already indicated briefly: the view alone is well worth the price. The one sunrise was almost beyond belief--awesome! The ""apartment"" is spacious and could probably be advertised as such. The ""laundry"" was so nice and full-sized (though we didn't need it). The kitchen and eating equipment was wonderful and it even had a double-door frig. The sayings on the walls, etc. indicate that these owners are Bible believing folks but not overdone.
Also as already indicated briefly: the macadem driveway was a bit muddy--after the rain...due to cows, etc. And the well done steps down to the lovely apartment might be improved with a railing."

I also love that it’s within 5-10 minutes of downtown Harrisonburg. It gives you the feeling of a private getaway but with options to go out without driving a further distance. Bryce was super nice and responsive, we also bought some breakfast sausage and steaks to make during our stay from their business and I highly recommend trying it! Would definitely consider staying again if I’m in the area."

The views of the hillsides are incredible. The host family is hospitable and warm. We got great food from the farm and recommendations for local restaurants and activities. The WiFi works well for remote workers. We stayed here for over 1 month, and we're so happy we did. The check-in and check-out process is seamless with our own door code: so no keys are required. There is plenty of space for parking. The location is close to all services, groceries, and a short trip to downtown. This Airbnb is a 10 out of 5. It is absolutely worth every penny of the price!"

The bed was comfortable, bathroom and kitchen had everything we needed.
Bryce was a great host and we even had a chance to meet him at the Harrisonburg Farmer's Market (and meet his dad on the way in and out - ""had"" to buy some of their grass fed beef at the small shop on their farm.) Also highly recommend the bread from their neighbor (Mill Song Bakery!)
As everyone also notes, the view is so so pretty - and it's fun to be on a property with such a nice family including grandkids."

The internet was very reliable and the place had everything we needed and was very clean. We put the kitchen to good use and had all the necessary items to make our meals. The hosts were very respectful and attentive, they even apologized for making noise while their family visited for the holidays (which we totally understood, but still very much appreciated them checking in)! In terms of the views, they speak for themselves. We loved waking up to the beautiful mountains and cows roaming the farm.

Stayed one night","Pros
- Unmatched view! It was gorgeous! Try to be there during the day so you can watch the world go by. They even had binoculars near the main window!
- Quiet and comfortable.
- Everything looked new and clean.
- The apartment was extremely well-equipped. We gave the kitchen a good workout, and everything went well! Every small and large appliance we could have needed was there, with the exception of a dishwasher.
- Tastefully decorated, with beautiful and clever touches all over the place.
- Nice shower.
- Great communication with the hosts. We never saw them, but they were very accommodating to our wishes.
Information
The mattress was soft, like a cloud. If that's good for you, you'll love it! The bed also had a down comforter/duvet. :-)
The tall kitchen table seats three; they have plates and bowls for four; and the living room seats four.
Cons
None! This place is fantastic!"

It was home away from home and we would recommend it to those who wants to be in a quiet place with a nice view. If you are there when the sun is setting, you could even see the fireflies in the fields!!! It was very pretty considering I’ve never seen them in person. Only an 8 minute drive to downtown Harrisonburg. Another plus is that the sausage that was provided during our stay was really delicious. Thank you again to our host Bryce!"

The local coffee from Merge was wonderful - we stopped at the shop and bought some to bring home with us! The place was so clean and cozy and felt like a home away from home. Cory (Michael's puddle mix) was adorable and friendly and my daughter loved getting to meet him and hang out with him.

Stayed a few nights","We're regular visitors to Harrisonburg and wanted a break from hotel stays. We found the perfect alternative in Summit Escape. It is peaceful with spectacular views in 3 directions. It was spotless and comfortable and quiet with everything we needed--reliable wifi, ample options to recharge devices, a coffee maker and almost-full kitchen stocked with snacks and water if we wanted them. We met the host, Michael, and he could not have been more hospitable. Our weather was perfect so we drank in the view and listened to the mockingbirds during those times when we weren't visiting family. Grocery, drug store, and coffee shop all nearby. Just as an FYI, there are outside stairs to get to the unit but they are well-maintained and lit at night. Good signage and a dedicated parking spot make it clear when you arrive that you are at the right spot. We'll be back without a doubt. Thanks, Mike and Jen."

The deck was perfect for sitting and reading in the morning while I drank my coffee. We even worked from home on the deck during one of the days. I will definitely be returning here next time I visit."

Stayed with kids","Easy & comfy stay in a location on the edge of town with incredible views. Easy check-in and good communication. We ended up having an additional kid with us at the last minute and they were very accommodating & flexible, providing extra sleeping arrangement for us.
Water filter would be a nice touch. Very slight smell of cows outside was not a problem for us, more nostalgic than yuck, but if you are really sensitive to that sort of thing, beware. Unlocking the lock-box was a little tricky if you, like me at first, did not read the instructions carefully.
Would definitely stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","Booked this stay for a long weekend away for the first time away as a couple. Its perfectly located close to harrisonburg but far enough away to feel private. The studio was perfect for what we needed. It was very clean and the kitchen had everything we would need. There was a designated parking spot which was wonderful and the path to the stairs and the stairs had been salted after the snow to prevent slips. The view from the balcony was beautiful, i only wish it had been warm enough outside in the hammock chairs. The hosts even had a helpful guide of the area with suggestions on what to do. The only note we had was that because of the placement of the suite we could here at lot of the noise from the rest of the house so light sleepers be aware. Doors opening and closing, faint dog barks etc. On one of the nights of our stay the hosts had what we assume was a game night which was in the room next to the suite. There was a bit of shouting and carrying on. We mostly found it funny but we could see how it could be bothersome to a different kind of guest. They had wrapped up their night before 10pm so not bothersome to our sleep. Overall a fantastic trip and i would recommend this place to anyone"

Stayed a few nights","Michael's place is a quaint upper level guest suite of their home with its own entrance. The suite is an open floor plan and you easily walk from living room, bedroom, and kitchen. We stayed here for access to Shenandoah National Park, and after a long day of hiking it was a nice touch to come back and unwind by watching Netflix on the SmartTV. The place was tidy and in order and had hand-sanitizer, masks, and gloves in the kitchen area for use. The kitchen is pretty minimal-- a hot stove with a single pan and a toaster oven for cooking, but plenty of cups , plates, bowls, and cutlery for use. The biggest draw is the deck. You get a gorgeous mountain view you can watch right from the bed, or sit out on the deck in the two swings and sip some coffee and take in the morning with a pal. Perfect stay for a hiker or couple for a short stay."

If you like to live some history while also having modern indoor plumbing, this is your destination.
Specifics: we loved the proximity to downtown Harrisonburg (lots of little shops & breweries), the many little touches of the unit (like a classic VCR & tapes & a vanity to beat all vanities), the property was walkable with barns & views of surrounding fields, & there was a very peaceful atmosphere that lets you really relax."

Upon entering, we were greeted by a warm and cozy family room that exudes charm and comfort. The half bath, with its moody ambiance, and the well-equipped kitchenette, gorgeous bedroom and master bath were just what we needed for a weekend escape. It's like stepping back in time while having all the modern comforts at your fingertips. There's a record player, and we found ourselves sinking into relaxation while enjoying some great tunes. The level of thought and care that Emily, the host, has put into every detail of this property is truly commendable. The Gray House is a haven of peace and quiet, and it offers the kind of comfort that makes you feel truly at home. We would highly recommend staying here, and cannot wait to return.

From the homemade cookies and sangria on arrival to toiletries and yoga mats, Howard has thought of every thing you could possibly need when you're away from home. I loved the local art decorating the walls. The space is so well used that it feels bigger than you would expect. I was sad when I saw rain in the forecast for the entirety of our trip, but we were still able to use the porch because it is fully covered and there are curtains on the side that help keep rain (and bugs) away. Highly highly recommend this place if you are visiting JMU or just want a relaxing place. We loved exploring but definitely looked forward to heading back to the Urban Oasis each day.

The space was a bit smaller than we had realized, but well organized and well stocked in both kitchen and bathroom. Older visitors should be aware that the walk from the guest parking to the entryway is very uphill and calls for some degree of ""being in shape"" to navigate. That said, we (at 73 and 74 respectively) were able to navigate without much more that a need to breathe deeply. Also, the porch and swing are great!"

Stayed a few nights","I was sold on this place when I saw the picture of the porch swings! Beautiful setting in the treetops above a rural valley! It was very quiet and restful. Unfortunately, because I was so busy helping my parents at VMRC (right over the hill), mine was more of a sleep-and-go kind of visit. I did spend one tranquil evening lying on the porch swing, listening to the birds and the rustling of the leaves in the cool twilight. Heaven!
Only two things during my stay were less than perfect: (1) I did not fully pay attention to the very clear notice that the guest parking spot was so steeply below the house level (my fault, bring your sneakers); and (2) the clothes closet was not tall enough to hang my longer garments. I guess the outside setting was just so enticing that everything else paled in comparison!"

Stayed about a week","I can’t say enough great things about this beautiful space!! It was so cute, so clean, and just so cozy. Howard left clear instructions on how to get in and where to park, the kitchen had any little thing we might have needed (we had coffee and tea mostly, and the fridge and microwave came in handy!)
He had cookies and sangria waiting for us when we checked in, perfect way to start our vacation!
The bed was comfy, including the sheets and pillows! And the bathroom was spotless! He had phone chargers already set up by the bed and desk so we never even used the ones we brought.
Overall I would stay here every time we make our annual visit to the burg! A lot of thought and time were put into the details of this space and it shows. Thanks for a wonderful stay Howard!!"

Stayed a few nights","My gf and I had a great 3-night stay. It was comfy, cozy and has a mountain view that we enjoyed while relaxing on the patio. The best part about this space was how clean and orderly it was and we really appreciated all of the small details added that made it feel homey. The kitchen has all the essential cooking utensils anyone would need. We could tell there was a lot of thought put into setting up this space so that guests have all they need. There are iPhone and Android chargers, a speaker, plenty of pillows & blankets, shower products, emergency tampons, makeup wipes, and a makeup mirror which are such great touches for ladies. We didn’t need for anything at all. Howard was even nice enough to gift us a bottle of prosseco as an anniversary gift and some homemade cookies which were so good. Though a shared space, we felt like we had privacy being on the lower level. We didn’t hear much noise from above and actually only saw Howard one time. We would highly recommend this stay."

Stayed a few nights","A wonderful spot for Shenandoah views while still staying connected (if you want to!). We did a half working/half taking-off-work vacation, and this place served all of our needs. The host is very responsive and the space has basically everything you would need for a short trip. The outdoor space is especially lovely for relaxing or for working from home in the comfort of a swinging couch! Highly recommend. Only thing I would note is to make sure you are aware of the house location description as there is quite an inclined walk up the driveway to get to the AirBnB space from the parking area. This was not an issue for us and the host does allow you to pull up to the top of the driveway and drop off people or luggage...but it is still something to consider as not everybody will be comfortable with that inclined walk. But otherwise, 5/5 stars!"

I was welcomed in with a personalize card, cookies, homemade sangria, chips, and the coziest, prettiest apartment I think I have ever stayed in.
This is a one bedroom studio attached to the Host's home. It is beautifully kept and well furnished. Private entrance and perfect location. The sunset can be seen through your window or the front porch. It really is magical to see.
In less than 20 minutes, you can go to a vineyard, JMU, downtown Harrisonburg, a Route 11 cruise, a brewery, or just a scenic drive. You will love the visit and feel right at home."

Stayed a few nights","Howard's unit is one of the most delightful Airbnb's my friend and I have ever stayed in. He is also the most thoughtful host I've ever had. If I ever need to stay overnight in Harrisonburg again, you better believe I will be staying here!
To start, Howard was very easy to communicate with! He was friendly and answered all of my questions promptly and without judgement. He provided ample information in advance AND inside of the unit itself.
The street the unit is on is lush, quaint, and quiet ~ save for delightful bird chatter and musical windchimes! It was easy to get to and about a 6 min. drive to downtown H'burg.
The studio has a gorgeous and inviting porch with comfy seating and string lights that you will not be able to resist.
Inside, the unit is even cuter than the pictures! It's a beautifully designed space, complete with local art work on the walls! The sleeping options were very comfortable ~ ample blankets and pillows were provided! The kitchenette had all that we needed, and even additional luxuries ~ there was a filtered water pitcher, a french press, and even a couple of treats waiting for us! The bathroom has a large mirror, with plenty of space for 2 people to get ready comfortably.
Every detail was thought of ~ there were apple & android phone chargers, a bose speaker, lotion and makeup remover in the bathroom, an egg crate foam cushion for the futon, and even a brush to wash bottles in addition to a sponge. These things may seem small, but they meant a LOT during a hectic weekend and made our stay incredibly comfortable.
I *highly* recommend staying at Howard's place!"

Stayed a few nights","If you are looking for a place to stay near Harrisonburg, look no further. Among all the places my wife and I have stayed at this was one of the best.
The place was in pristine condition, all the dining utensils, appliances and accessory items are very clean and easily accessible. My wife and I travel quite a bit, and needless to say to have encountered places where dinner plates, utensils and appliances were not properly cleaned. Since then, we have been skeptical about using utensils at Airbnbs. However, Howards place threw us off totally. The dishes and utensils were squeaky clean, all the appliances were in working conditions and were also clean.
Howard had taken the time to make small pouches for pressed coffee so guests don't have to guess how much coffee to use. Made our coffee making experience so much easier. That takes time and a foresight.
My wife was especially impressed by the toiletries. It was very thoughtful to have feminine products, make removing wipes and a first aid kit. In so many Airbnbs that we have stayed in, we have never seen feminine products and making up removing wipes anywhere. There was travel side toothpaste, scrub, mouthwash etc. There was even a first aid kit.
Howards place is a home away from home. So much thought has gone into making this place as comfortable as possible. On our last day we had the chance to chat with him and get to know him a bit. He was very pleasant and friendly and make us feel very welcome in his home."

The good news is- you are done searching for the perfect accommodations —as you have found the hidden gem!! While the location was perfect (w/in minutes to everything) and watching the sunset amongst the mountain backdrop was breathtaking (forever imprinted in my memory), it was the actual temporary living accommodations that far surpassed my expectations! Quality (check): Cleanliness (check): Comfort (check): Amenities (check): Serenity (check): Hospitality (check): Attention to Detail (CHECK, CHECK). Nothing in all the other 5-star reviews is fabricated. They are all true. If you are fortunate enough to meet your host, Howard, you will witness the genuine concern he personally has for your comfort and enjoyment. I will, without a doubt, be back."

I broke my foot two days before we left. We planned to do some hiking, so instead we hung around. We relaxed and still had a great time. The relaxing was exactly what we needed. We did go into Harrisonburg where they had craft shops, bakeries, ice creams stores and regular restaurants. We liked Clementine's for dinner, and the bakery next to the information center for take away breakfast foods. The Arboretum is nice too, and nearby.
All in all it was a much better experience than I thought we would have. Howard also provides the renter with cookies and a stocked up refrigerator."

Howard was so kind and there were many thoughtful touches in the space. The weather was unfortunately unseasonably very cold and rainy during our visit so we couldn’t enjoy the amazing deck with ultra comfortable swings and beautiful views. It was a great place to stay and we highly recommend it."

The scenery on the deck was captivating and the swing made it even more relaxing - it was like a spa. Would definitely recommend this place for one or two people who need a quiet relaxing place to stay in Harrisonburg."

Stayed a few nights","Howard’s place is such a gem!! My husband and I stayed for three nights to do a little fly fishing in the area and this was the perfect spot to stage from. The studio was immaculate and very cozy. Howard has taken steps to ensure everything is sanitized between guests and we immediately felt at ease.
This place is loaded with amenities....too many to list but the extra thoughtful touches of a wireless phone charger, speaker system and fresh cookies and scones were appreciated. After fishing we’d store our gear on the porch and enjoy the peaceful view from the swinging bench.
We’d stay here again in a flash!!!"

The area is large enough to spend time in beyond sleeping and as clean & hospitable as promised. Howard was so kind and took the extra mile to ensure our safety and transportation abilities by shoveling the driveway mid-snowstorm! Definitely an ideal spot for anyone wanting to enjoy all the sweet treats Harrisonburg has to offer (:

The studio itself has a well-appointed kitchen for all your cooking needs, including delightful snacks and drinks. The bed is quite comfy and the TV is setup for Roku streaming services.

Howard is all about the thoughtful touches-- the space was stocked with coffee, homemade baked goods, SANGRIA, soaps and blankets, the works. And in the era of COVID, it was reassuring to know that the space was clean and cared for. You pretty much just need to show up and relax. We can't thank Howard enough for being such a great host and we hope to be back again in the near future!"

It is in a quiet location off a dead end street but easy to get to. It was tastefully decorated and well appointed. The kitchen had anything I could have needed including nice flatware, dishes and stemware and a selection of fine teas. Multiple coffee makers and a water filter were also provided. The bed was very comfortable and there was a couch, a big comfy chair and a small counter with two stools for a quick breakfast. The bathroom was large and well lit and came with some amenities such as a blow dryer, shampoo and body wash. The host thought of everything you could need for a short or long stay. The host followed up upon my arrival and made sure I was comfortable and had if I had any questions, they were very discrete and accommodating.

Howard himself, of course, was very kind and accommodating.
The best part of the studio for me was the beautiful porch, swing, and surrounding trees. I was able to practice yoga, read, and journal outside on the swing and it was the perfect escape from the city.

Howard has clearly poured love, creativity, and hard work into every little detail of his space. We were lucky enough to double the amount of time that we could stay and it was worth every minute. We drove away fully relaxed, and recharged, ready to return whatever life might have in store for us.
We loved sitting on the tranquil porch swing while mediating in a private rainforest, this alone was worth the trip.
Howard was the quintessential host, excellent at communicating, and being available if needed, but plenty of privacy. The wifi was superior, the space was immaculately clean, and included a fully stocked kitchen loaded with thoughtful touches, tea, coffee, oatmeal, spices, and even things for baking. Homemade cookies and scones too!

The bedrooms are large and there are 2 living areas to relax and have fun. We were able to prepare full meals and eat together at the large dining table. We were visiting our daughter at JMU. This home is just a short drive to Harrisonburg and minutes away from grocery, gas and restaurants. Eliot was a great host making sure that we had what we needed for our stay. We will definitely stay here again. Thank you, Eliot!"

We have a family of five with kids ranging from 3-18 and there was something for every age in the house. It had the right bit of everything one might need when borrowing a house. So many thoughtful details and everything felt brand new and fresh. Eliot welcomed us even before we arrived and made the process so easy throughout our stay. The location is on a road without a sidewalk so no walking to anything-however, it was such a short, easy drive to campus and downtown with great places to eat! We loved staying here and would definitely book it again next time we are in town!"

We had 2 couples for the weekend but could easily have had 3 couples. There is a beautiful view from the deck and everything was set up so thoughtfully! The place would also be great for a family with children who
would have a very safe backyard to enjoy!
Lots of games and some toys too! There is a corn hole game available for use and a ping pong table!
The Martin Cottage is a Great place to stay!

Eliot responded quickly and friendly if we did have a question. We were also pleased that the house had everyday needs such as trash bags, detergent, cleaners, coffee, and etc.
We hope to stay again when we are in the area."

The house is tastefully decorated and extremely well-equipped, including lots of dishes, mixing bowls, pots and pans , cleaning supplies, travel items a guest might have forgotten, extra linens, etc. The “coffee bar” was ideal, complete with Peet’s coffee!
We also very much appreciated access to Netflix et al on TV. Loved the small deck looking over the back yard field below, especially when the traffic was light.
One more very important aspect of Eliot’s place is the lower level full of games, ping pong and even cornhole.
We heartily recommend the Martin Cottage!

Group trip","We loved our stay at The Martin Cottage! It was a peaceful area, just a few minute drive away from downtown Harrisonburg. The house is decorated beautifully and Eliot has thought of every amenity and nice touch to make his guests’ stay enjoyable. The coffee bar was a highlight! Eliot was easily to reach and very accommodating.
The only downside was that there wasn’t a door between the main level and the basement. So, in the morning, the people upstairs had to be super quiet to try to not wake up the people who were sleeping in the basement. (But if you all woke up at the same time, or didn’t have people sleep downstairs, it wouldn’t even be a problem.)
Bottom line: I highly recommend it. We had a great stay!"

The surroundings are beautiful --a delightful country setting, just a few miles from James Madison University. I ran on the main road that leads to The Cottage, and even though it's a busy road, I felt safe. Views on my run included rolling hills, lots of cows, bubbling brooks, historic churches, and gorgeous sunrises.
Eliot and his wife go out of their way to provide amenities -from coffee to goodies at check in, and everything was very clean. There is lots of room to enjoy at The Cottage, so it would make a great place for a family get away. ~ I was there for a work related trip and needed excellent wifi --The Cottage did not disappoint :--)
I highly recommend not only The Cottage, but Eliot and his wife as hosts. <3"

Her home is in such a beautiful and quiet area, yet minutes away from anything you might want to do or see in Harrisonburg and the surrounding area. The kitchen was well-stocked with essentials, the bed and linens were beyond comfortable and the shower – wow! We also appreciated the perk of having a washer and dryer in the unit, first time ever in an Airbnb for us and it came in very handy.

We enjoyed being able to drink our coffee first thing in the morning as this is our usual routine. We went to breakfast at Mr Js Bagels on our last morning. Everything about our stay was great!
We would definitely pick Carries place again!!"

Carrie's apartment unit was perfect. It was just the right size for the 2 of us and was very cozy. We were able to hear footsteps upstairs and a dog barking at times but absolutely nothing to be bothered by. There was even some lovely piano music one afternoon that was great to relax to! Overall, everything was clean, tidy and very convenient to downtown. Carrie's welcome book even recommended some local places for food & drink that are on our new list of favorites! We will definitely be back the next time we visit Harrisonburg!"

We visited Woods Edge Farm just down the road and there is a Food Lion not far away. The flowers in the neighborhood were gorgeous. I thought they were fake at first because they were so pretty! Carrie's home is very comfortable. The kitchen had everything we needed. The bed was comfortable and the shower was great. Carrie's place is excellent for those with mobility problems. No steps to get in or around inside and no steps for the shower. The washer and dryer were very helpful, so we didn't have to pack much for our trip. The temperature was perfectly comfortable. We never turned on the TV because there was so much for us to see while we were there. I did use the internet once and had no issues with connectivity. Everything was very clean. We stayed here again because we enjoyed it so much the 1st time and we'll stay there again when in the area."

Stayed a few nights","Carrie's basement apartment was amazing. Absolutely everything we could have needed for cooking, plates/cups/utensils, cleaning supplies, laundry essentials, as well as some pantry staples we're included (rice, spices, sauces, etc). Even a blender, teas, coffee. The bed was incredibly comfortable, as were the pillows. My husband and I stayed here with a friend, who said the air mattress and bedding was comfortable as well. She went above and beyond to make our stay as comfortable as possible. The apartment is underneath their household, so there is some noise, but we actually loved hearing their dog occasionally as it reminded us of our dogs at home. On our last day, we had car trouble and needed to have it fixed before we could drive 7 hours home. Carrie let us check out a couple hours late so we could get that sorted out. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone lucky enough to find availability. Thank you again Carrie!"

We were looking for a place to stay while visiting Massanutten resort. This was only about 30 minutes. Shortly before our visit, Carrie reached out to make sure we were aware of the upcoming snow storm that the area was expecting. She also let me know that if conditions were too bad and we needed to stay an extra night, that they had the availability. While visiting, she made sure everything was as expected, that the driveway was shoveled for us, and provided an awesome recommendation for a place to go sledding that was just a few blocks away. The apartment was beautifully decorated and stocked with all the normal essentials and then some. This place exceeded my expectations and I would book the apartment againin a heartbeat if I need accommodations again in the area."

Stayed over a week","Count yourself lucky if you are able to score a reservation at this charming and lovely AirBNB in the heart of a peaceful retirement community in Harrisonburg, VA. This place is truly a hidden gem and a rare find. The apartment looks exactly as advertised and your host Carrie has seen to it that every convenience has been provided for your comfort .One can easily see that the apartment was just remodeled and everything worked very efficiently. Also, the entire place was immaculate. The kitchen was fully stocked with all the appliances and accessories you could want and the bathroom was just as pictured with a laundry hidden away behind closet doors. One of the best features for me was to treat myself to as many outdoor café breakfasts, lunches and dinners as I could make on that lovely patio that sits to the side of the entrance. The scenery from there at night is just beautiful. Another really nice perk was being able to drive up my own private driveway right to the front door almost. That was a really big help getting things back and forth from the car to the apartment. Your host Carrie, always responds within minutes of receiving your communication and will go out of her way to provide whatever convenience you might need to make your stay more comfortable. She really exemplifies the meaning of ""Super Host"". This AirBNB rates 5 stars across the board for exceptional everything. I highly recommend you try and get on the waiting list for this beautiful little home away from home. You will not be disappointed."

We couldn’t have asked for a better hostess or environment. Carrie and her family live upstairs, but you will rarely hear any sounds; maybe an occasional bark, or chair moving. Our favorite was listening in as her daughter practiced her piano! Delightful! The apartment was perfect for a couple and well equipped for our time away from home. Cozy and so nicely decorated. I especially loved the shower! Felt like a luxury hotel, complete with soft fluffy towels! She really supplies everything you need. Very responsive and helpful in recommending places to eat and things to do during your stay. Friendly and fun to connect with.
Carrie has beautiful gardens and shared her raspberries and lettuce with us. She encourages her guests to use the little patio and even provided tiny string lites in mason jars to enhance our evenings spent outside! I could go on and on. We are already looking forward to our next stay! Don’t hesitate to reserve this apartment. You will be so glad you did!"

It had everything that you hope for - a comfortable bed, awesome shower, space to stretch out, a functional kitchen, nice neighborhood, and of course, affordability. What put it over the top for us was the aesthetic appeal - we felt good being in the space. All of the elements - furniture and decor - come together really well; Carrie obviously has a great eye for decorating and really cares about providing her guests an excellent experience. In our opinion, she's earned the super, super host award. Thanks Carrie, well done!!!!"

Stayed a few nights","I cannot say enough positive things about Carrie and the space she manages. This is my 2nd time staying at Carrie’s, and I hope to stay there every time I’m in the area.
The space was extremely clean, quiet, and homey. Carrie was proactive in her communication with me. An emergency situation happened in town while I was there. She immediately made me aware of it, and I greatly appreciated that.
With no hesitation, I highly recommend staying at Carrie’s place."

Stayed a few nights","Carrie’s spot was perfect. It is your own private in-law suite with a separate entrance and your own driveway. It was very clean and well decorated. It felt like a cozy apartment and even though it is only one bedroom it was a very spacious unit. The washer/dryer is an amazing amenity that I very much appreciated and the bed was BEYOND comfortable. Yes, you can hear a little bit of footsteps from upstairs during daytime hours but it’s no where near bothersome and actually made me feel more at home. Much better stay than a hotel room that’s for sure! Thanks again Carrie."

One last thing - don’t hesitate to let Brad’s dog Cali meet you - SUPER sweet !!!

Stayed a few nights","We had a very nice weekend stay in this perfect little downtown spot!
Quiet and safe neighborhood. It’s a short and easy walk downtown to tons of shopping, bars, restaurants, farmers market, etc.
The space is completely updated, very comfortable, well appointed and spotlessly clean.
The host was very communicative and accommodating. He took the time to provide two very helpful welcome books full of great tips, local recommendations, etc. Definitely take a few minutes to read through them - They are very well done and spot on.
There’s parking for two vehicles, but, just a heads-up: it is a narrow driveway. Our Honda pickup fit, but it was tight. Consider a smaller car if you have the option.
Overall, a great find. Would definitely stay again.
Thanks!"

The entrance is on the back side of the house facing beautiful woods. The place is well kept with nice amenities. Totally loved the bathroom. the only thing which could have been slightly better is the bed (the mattress springs seem to have been worn out slightly) but it was ok for a short 3 day stay for us. Shenandoah national park and skyline drive is about 45 mins to an hour from the place. The cost was extremely reasonable for a 3 day stay so very happy with everything.

Wi-Fi worked perfect for me to get a little work done in the evening, was able to access my work VPN with no issues! Loved the ice in the freezer and book of recommendations. We got bagels from the recommended spot and they were AMAZING. The house is secluded private and quiet but still so close to town.

Stayed a few nights","We loved our stay at this Airbnb. Josiah was super friendly, helpful, and accommodating. The suite was really nice and we agreed it was much better than a hotel! Noted from another review, it can be a little tricky to find the first time, especially during nighttime - the driveway is a couple hundred feet farther up the road than Apple Maps said and when the driveway splits, stay to the right! There is marked parking and stairs going down to the suite. There is a little bit of noise overlap between the suite below and the main house above due to an air vent running between the two - not a big deal but good to note (there is a portable fan provided if you need a little extra white noise when you sleep).
Josiah provided great food recommendations and was super responsive during our stay. We stayed here to be close to Shenandoah National Park. The Airbnb is a little over an hour from the top entrance and 20 minutes from the closest entrance. We highly recommend staying with Josiah!"

Stayed a few nights","This space is super cozy and worked for my short stay. Tucked away in a beautiful green residential neighborhood, the home itself is very private and has a great small patio view on an expansive green backyard. As the home is new construction, everything is well-appointed. Josiah and his family have a friendly golden retriever on the property who is the most handsome friendly pup! Easy parking, keyless entry, I highly recommend this private space."

Stayed a few nights","Stayed here 2 nights. my and I this place! There's a shared driveway with another house and our nav took us to the other house first (but it's the house on the right!) Once inside, everything was immaculately kept. Our only issue was no silverware in the kitchen. TV is wifi only, so we only managed to watch LG channels without having to log into the subscription channels. Not really a big deal, but just a heads-up if you're used to a guide-full of cable channels to surf through. All-in-all, a great place to stay and we would definitely consider staying here again!"

We had time to walk to the nearby park and was impressed with all the different spaces it had to accommodate everyone - a great playground, small groups engaged in a variety of sports, a number of park shelters, walking trails, etc. Wish we had more time to explore the area.
We would certainly stay here again."

This is not a pricey stay, a converted basement room with bathroom, but it's a solid and cozy space, and there's a distinctiveness to the art, which made my stay special (along with good coffee in the morning, a comfy bed, good shower, and easy in/out keyless access."

Stayed one night","I met and communicated with Victor during my overnight stay. He met me promptly at the clearly marked Airbnb parking entrance and showed me the space. Everything was very clean and comfortable. I would recommend the space for anyone who needs a small space for a short stay.
While the place was excellent and inexpensive, do be aware the space is, as advertised, small. There is also no microwave, or at least not one that I could find. The air conditioner kicking on and off is a bit loud. You can hear footsteps and floor creaks, but there was very little movement in the house and the movement was outside a decent range of sleeping hours. These things did not bother me and I would stay here again, but I could see them being an issue for anyone with sound sensitivities.
There are other nice little touches, such a surge with multiple USB charging points. Water, hand sanitizer, wipes, and a lot of the essentials.
Victor was very friendly and accommodating. I'll be looking to stay again."
