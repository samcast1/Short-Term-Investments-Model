Stayed one night","This was a great find!!! The home seems to be decorated by Joanna Gaines! If I had an AirBnB, I would definitely decorate the same way. After 2 days of driving 1500 miles from far southern California, I was extremely tired, this home felt like home! Fell fast asleep. It was clean, had everything, and was conveniently located to town.
Heidi was super responsive and no issues with self entry or self checkout.
If you are wanting a very nice, clean and extremely comfortable home to stay, THIS IS IT!"

Stayed a few nights","I stayed with a friend in the Cowboy Bunkhouse for two nights. Our stay was for a fishing trip in Matagorda Bay. The Cowboy Bunkhouse was the perfect place. It’s two bedroom, one bath and is exceptionally comfortable. Individual AC control rooms kept the house wonderfully cool. We watched lots of fishing YouTube videos on the big screen TV. Cell service is not the best in Markham but Wi-Fi at the house kept us in contact with Home. We really enjoyed our stay and Susan added a very nice touch with homemade baked cookies upon our arrival. We’re looking forward to our next stay there!"

Susan was an incredible host and even dropped off fresh baked cookies (she promised they were equivalent to salad so I had no problems eating the entire batch!). The house is immaculate and had everything we could’ve needed. We were there for a wedding and bragged to all the other guests about the Cowboy Bunkhouse (they were at a hotel nearby and they I know every single one of them was jealous). Thank you so much Susan for making us feel right at home. Can’t wait to come back for another visit!

Stayed over a week","We walked in to the smell of chocolate chip cookies that sat covered on the table still soft an warm. I shoved at least three in my mouth before I remembered I usually don’t eat c.c. Cookies. The house is beautifully decorated with very rustic farm decor and big on charm. This two bed room one bath fit our needs perfectly for our two dogs and us. The six min. drive into town was close enough to get all or provisions yet, the right distance to get way from it all. Here you can unplug kick back an enjoy the one you are with. Markham offers several places to eat an get all three meals of the day also a 24 hour gas station around the corner for any last minute items for the home or car. The owners are very hands off to provide all the privacy you need and were readily available to address any issues you might have. They offered us first hand knowledge on the area which was very helpful in making our decision for areas of places to reside. The two months in the Bunkhouse made for a comfortable, quiet, an pleasant stay. You will not be disappointed with this Airbnb. I give this place six stars on a scale of 1-5. Lisa and Joaquin G."

Stayed a few nights","The Cowboy bunkhouse is a gem in middle of Texas’s southeast coastal plains. Susan is a perfect example of why Carol and I find it acceptable to travel with Airbnb. She communicated with us on travel day to make sure everything was ready for us on arrival. The only issue that Carol and I had was, we believe in Texas sized coffee cups. So if you like big coffee cups, might bring your own. If time takes us back to the area we would like to stay there again."

Susan is an amazing host, checking in to make sure we had everything we needed and the fresh cookies were a special and delicious touch."

Stayed a few nights","My dad and I recently stayed at the “Cowboy Bunkhouse” for the state softball tournament. I was looking for a quiet, cozy place we could stay with my small dogs. This adorable little home was perfect! We originally booked 2 days and added a day after the games progressed. Susan was superb at communicating and assisting me all weekend. This was my first Airbnb experience and I am super impressed! Susan went out of her way to make sure our needs were met and even left homemade cookies upon arrival. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. My dad and I enjoyed our relaxing weekend with a short commute to the games. My dogs were comfortable and happy as well and I was able to leave them for short period knowing they were in good hands at the bunkhouse. :)"

The kitchen beyond the living room has a full sized refrigerator, a gas stove and oven, a microwave, ice trays in the freezer, and utensils for eating in the drawers.
The bathroom has a beautiful vanity space, a full sized bathtub shower combo that was impeccably clean, and is decorated in a charming way that makes you want to relax. There were towels and . We stayed in the bedroom directly next to the bathroom and were extremely comfortable. The closet has a really cool barn style door. The WiFi had a good stable connection. Susan is super helpful and answered all of our questions quickly. We would very happily return to the Cowboy Bunkhouse."

This elevated beach house was a nice and quiet escape after a long day at the beach for our family of 5. Everything was clean, the A/C worked, and the kitchen and bathroom were appropriately stocked up. Great value for the price. I do recommend bringing your own food with you as there are not many options nearby."

Wifi was easy to use as well as the Tv which was great aince they provided the networks .

Stayed a few nights","We had a great stay at the Coastal Crab! Their beach house is so cute and comfy and the finishing features were just adorable!
The kitchen had a coffee maker, with coffee and tea available, waters in the fridge and was spotless. They had dish soap and dishwasher detergent available for use.
The bathroom was fully stocked with towels and beach towels...along with other items in case you forgot anything.
The bedrooms are super comfy. The master has the AC over the bed which kept the room at a nice temp all evening. The beds are firm, but very comfortable. We didn't have any trouble sleeping there, which can be an issue when traveling.
The fenced in yard was ideal for our two dogs that were traveling with us; There were games too for us to play in the evenings!
They made the recommendation of going to the Crab Trap for dinners....this place was FANTASTIC. We went both nights and everything was good. I had the blackend red fish both nights and highly recommend it"

The beach nearby isn’t the best but there is one 40 minutes away that is great! The home itself was so beachy and cute and beds were comfortable. There was everything from a variety of spices to popsicles to an amazing coffee maker! Would 100% come back for another stay! Wifi was also good quality and all 4 of us were able to maintain a stable connection as well as when we were doing our summer homework on our computers. Felt very safe here and the bar/restruant 4 minutes away that they recommended showed us the definition of southern hospitality and the community we were located in was very friendly where everyone knows everyone.

Stayed a few nights","A very nice little house with many amenities. Everything anyone would need to make a great dinner. Lots of table ware and room to work. I received a great welcome card and homemade cookies with my arrival. The TV had guest accounts for Netflix and Amazon Prime. I have never seen that. Ceiling fans in every room kept it warm and the air circulating. (It was a cold week, in the summer these fans would disperse the central air conditioning nicely).
The door code was catered to me as well. Susan offered an upgrade she didn’t have to and it was a great option. I was there for work which was very close.
I would stay here again anytime!"

Stayed with a pet","Lovely old house. Keep in mind, this is an old house with a lot of creaks and rattles that go with old houses, but it apparently has been well maintained and/or well repaired. Though close to the highway, we couldn’t hear highway noise inside the house, or even the neighbors car alarm that was going off when I went outside.
Susan left fresh baked cookies and home raised eggs on the table for us which was a very nice touch.
The fenced yard was great. My dog is not a jumper, but it’s a standard height fence, so if your dog IS a jumper, keep a close eye on it. Also, my dog is large so it wasn’t an issue, but there are gaps around the gate a small dog could escape from. I don’t see either as an issue because I’m not locking my dog outside in a strange yard, no matter the fence, but some dog owners are’s as responsible, so be aware.
We only cooked one meal (who wants to cook on vacation?) but the kitchen was well equipped with seasonings and such, and had the pots/pans/utensils we needed to cook, and was close to several restaurants and the grocery store (not that anything can be THAT far in Bay City when you are used to living in larger cities.
Susan and Paul were very responsive to issue when the TV didn’t work, and when I missed the email about the combination to the door. They were very cheerful and friendly, and I look forward to staying at one of the properties again, though I’m kind of looking at the bunkhouse once the weather is cooler."

Not much to add to my earlier review, just a few weeks ago, but did I mention, last time, the astonishingly fast 1 Gbps AT&T fiber service? Or some of the lovely quirky touches such as the tap for the handbasin in the bathroom? Or the amazingly powerful and quiet a/c that quickly drops the entire house down to the temperature of your choice, even when it is 90° and up outside?

As last time, highly recommended."

Stayed with a pet","This property is a nicely restored/done up older single family residence, with a generous amount of yard on all sides.

It is close to downtown, functional, and has some nice ""quirks to it"" - most notable a type of tap in the bathroom I've never seen before. (ps - the shower is excellent.)

The beds were comfortable, everything worked, and the a/c, while not needing to work very hard in spring, seemed powerful and certainly kept temperatures will under control.

Some people - okay, most people - will notice the train horn sounds when trains go by at night, but this is a feature of much of Bay City (look at a map and see all the rail tracks going through town). You do get to tune it out after a while.

The nicest feature? The hosts - Susan and Paul. A lovely couple, eager to help, and eager to exceed expectations in all respects.

Bottom line - a great stay experience. I've already booked a longer return visit."

On top of that, the hosts Susan and Paul were outstanding! We have 5 little dogs and it was nearly impossible to find a place to stay while our house was finished being built. Not only were they willing to take us on, they made several adjustments to the yard to help keep our 5 dogs safe. They truly went over above and beyond for us (OK, for our dogs)
We could not have made or transition from Indiana to Texas without them.
A very heartfelt thank you! 💙🧡❤️💜💛

We were able to cook our meals with the pots/pans provided and Susan was very accommodating - she very graciously dropped off a small food processor so that we could make hummus! Communication is great, and we had no real issues. The only thing that I wish could have been different was that there is a ditch around the house with standing water- as well as standing water in the yard itself, which makes for LOTS of mosquitos. So as long as you stay indoors or wear bug spray you will be fine!"

Honestly this was my best experience with AirBNB because of Mrs. Susan, she literally went out of her way to make us feel more at home by baking us cookies and banana bread.

Stayed over a week","We stayed for over two weeks while our home was renovated. We had a very comfortable stay, me, my husband and German shepherd Agatha! there was enough space for the three of us, and plus Agatha had a fenced area to hang out during the day. Internet was really good, both of us were able to work all day without issues considering that my work requires graphics and remote desktop connections to work. You find all you need to run a home, kitchen appliances, utensils, washer/dryer. You are just minutes away to very good restaurants like La Casona, a tex mex place. You are also 25 min way from Matagorda Beach, which was really nice. We would drive there after work, to relax and watch the stars. Finally Susan was really helpful and flexible by accommodating the check in to our scedule and also shipping some items we left behind back to us. We had never received such a great treatment by an Airbnb host. 😉 Will definitely stay there again."

This place is about a 20-minute drive from the beach, and has everything that you need. From coffee maker, to gas stove and oven, to washer and dryer, we did not need for anything.

William even had a couple pages in his binder rating the local restaurants which was a major help when we were deciding on dinner! Bay City is about 25 minutes from beach access so if you are looking for a house that lets you have a short drive from a beach this is a really great option.

There was no rush to push us out the door when we had to leave, Will let us take our time. It was very clean and tidy. All of the appliances worked great, and there was no problem settling in. It really is a perfect home for couples, or just one person."

Stayed a few nights","Susan was a wonderful host. Her well-timed hospitality ensured I was given simple direction on how to access the room before I arrived, and I felt that Susan was very respectful of my privacy once my stay had begun and my questions had been answered. During my stay it was quiet and peaceful at all times, both in the room and the surrounding neighborhood. I never felt like there was any sleep or comfort lost as a result.
In short I’d say I have no complaints: My stay was pleasant, comfortable and affordable, made only better by Susan’s considerations and excellent choices for restaurants. If I had to do my trip to Bay City over again, I would certainly pick the Robin’s Nest, no hesitation."

My Robin's Nest unit upstairs, above the garage, felt private and was very clean and tastefully decorated in keeping with the birding theme. This upstairs unit has sloping ceilings on either side, so if you're tall you may have to duck at times. Bay City is small, so my work commute was just 4 minutes. A plus!"

I hadn't been to Bay City in almost 6 months and was very happy to find that the trains are no longer sounding their horns at night.

Tim is super friendly, shares info about local attractions, and is available for help. He also is very respectful of privacy and lets you have the space to enjoy. The pictures don't do this place justice. I was there for R & R, and to do some birding. It was perfect on both counts. I brought all my food, and the kitchen lacked nothing for meal prep. They even have an air fryer. I highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","We chose this spot as it was closer to Palacios than Bay City. (Palacios was the central location for the Matagorda Bird Festival that we were attending.) The price was right, and we liked the cancellation policy which was generous. Also the lack of a cleaning fee was a big plus.
We were happy with the spaciousness of the lodging. The lighting was good and the whole place was spotless. The kitchen decor and appliances were in excellent condition.
There were several snacks, bottled water, even a few single service portions of breakfast cereal, and a small bottle of milk available. We had picked up take out BBQ in Bay City, and all the plates, silverware, glasses were handy as was the dishwasher and dish soap if needed. The only thing I wished there had been was a glass microwaveable dish, but there were microwaveable bowls available.
I always worry that hosts will be hovering, but Tim showed us around upon arrival and then left us alone.
We will stay there again if in the area."

The water flow during showers is perfect. Not too weak or strong. The guest house can sleep four but I feel like it is suited better for just two people. A great getaway place for two!

They gave us a paper with directions to places near by. There was quite a few mosquitoes out there but other than that the place and the people were great and I highly recommend visiting if you’re in the area.

The hospitality was amazing! It is in a safe location and is surrounded by beautiful trees and feels so peaceful. We will be staying here again next time we visit! I wish we would have been able to stay a couple extra nights just to be able to relax and enjoy the outdoors. Grill some food and make some s’mores with the kids at night with the fire pit. So thankful I found this place. Made our trip so much more enjoyable."

Stayed one night","Tim’s place was spectacularly spacious and peaceful. The layout was perfect for my partner and I to unwind. With Aretha Franklin playing on the record player, the living room quickly felt homey. The space in the cooking area was helpfully open come dinner time, and the washer/dryer came in hand when we spilt said dinner on ourselves. The snacks that Tim and his wife left in the bread box were simply perfect for movie night, and the little amenities we found in the cabinets couldn’t have made us feel more welcomed. The stay was more than what we expected, and we truly enjoyed our time, although too short. We will be definitely booking in the future, and couldn’t be more excited to come back."

Stayed over a week","We stayed at this beautiful place for almost 3 weeks. Tim was very accommodating and allowed us to have our doggie Agatha with us. The apartment is one of the best airbnb we have stayed at (and we have been to quite a few). All the amenities were top of the line. In most Airbnb you get the spare items from the owners home or things like that. Not here. Washer, dryer, kitchen appliances, furniture and bedroom set were great. The bed is really comfortable, hotel style comfortable I would say. The place was also spot clean and you have all you need to do your own cleaning if you feel like. Internet is really fast, We actually worked everyday remotely without issues, considering my job demands VPN connection and advanced graphics. The surroundings of the property are nice as well. There is a little trail (about 10 min) in the premises of property where you can go for a walk and decompress. Matagorda Beach is 35 min away, which we visited a few times and you can get some restaurants in Palacios (15 min away) or Bay City (20 min away). If you are looking for a place to stay in the area, don't look any further."

They have extra linens so you can pick what you prefer and a wonderful king size bed! We arrived on Valentine's day and had a gift bag of candy to welcome us. Everything was so thoughtful and very clean and new. The property is beautiful with huge trees, outdoor seating area, and a nature trail right there! We loved our stay!"

I enjoyed taking walks along the gulf (one option is about 30 min away). Another day I went to the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge which is about 1 hour and 15 min away; it offers several short hikes that I enjoyed. That obviously is a bit of a journey but I am very glad I did it. There is a very nice short path through the woods on their property for those not looking for such a long car ride to get outdoors."

They communicated with us all on a regular basis and always let us know if there was something happening (i.e. housekeeping, renovations, extra goodies, replacement of towels, bedding and anything else we may have needed). We will be back gladly. Super hosts for sure!
The house is beautiful, spacious and well kept! It was nice to come back after a long day of work and have a place to relax (inside and out). Just a wonderful place with wonderful hosts. You won't be sorry if you stay (just sorry to leave!) :)"

Stayed with a pet","We had a great time. Ours was a fishing trip for my husbands birthday. There was alot of small fish that were caught but nothing we could keep, just 1 alligator gar that my son caught. The area and location in general is not great for fishing. We did however enjoy having bar b que's and just relaxing and spending time together with our friends and family. One of the bedrooms is down stairs. That bedroom is more for teens. It is a great gaming bedroom but it has no restroom so during the night they had to be going outside and upstairs to use the restroom. Also anytime we were outside fishing we had to go upstairs to use the restroom. The kitchen is great. I loved that they had Starbucks ground coffee to make. The house was really clean. I loved that they had items and even food available for dogs. Also the beach patio set outside is awesome. There is a General Dollar store like 7 blocks which is very convenient. We enjoyed our stay."

Good fishing spot, plenty to do for the kids including dart board, shuffle board, corn hole and horse shoes. The elevator made things so much easier when packing in and out. Great place and great Mgt.
Thank you so much,"

Stayed with a pet","Cammie's home is beautiful, close to the ocean, and in a natural setting that is peaceful and beautiful all on its own. The porch and deck are amazing, there are activities and amenities all throughout the property, and everything we could have possibly needed was set up for us. We would have loved to stay here much longer and we will definitely be back."

Stayed with kids","We had an amazing time! We will definitely be back! Home was very comfortable and welcoming. House was clean. Only wished there was a TV in each bedroom but other than that we totally enjoyed ourselves. Great fishing . Mosquitos were crazy but we were prepared for that lol. Beach, Dollar Store, and Bait shop directly up the road! Thanks Sunny for responding so fast to all questions! I would highly recommend this stay to anyone."

Group trip",There's room for parking 2 vehicles and a boat. We rode our pontoon and docked it outback. Did some crabbing and fishing. Played games with the family. The location of the house and the size of the house is perfect for a family to enjoy comfortably. We would like to do it again sometime soon.

Group trip","Sunny’s house was perfect for our family- it was clean upon arrival with freshly washed towels and sheets. The Wi-Fi was perfect for our little ones to play their games while we enjoyed watching movies from our Netflix account. Sunny provided beach smelling shampoos, soaps and lotions - we felt like we were at a bed and breakfast! Quaint beach house on the water at an affordable price. We all had enough space to spread out. We will be back next year. Thanks Sunny!"

Stayed a few nights","Easy to find. Sargent is a nice low key place to relax. Easy to find a spot at the beach. House is comfy and accommodating. Has everything you need for a good relaxing get away. Sunny recommended The Crab Trap it was a good place to eat some good seafood. We found the Flamingo drive thru liquor store, the ladies there were very helpful and friendly!"

Everything was great especially with Sunny's steady stream of communication for all of our questions. The home was great and even had a welcome basket of drinks and snacks. Definitely will recommend to others looking for a getaway from home.
