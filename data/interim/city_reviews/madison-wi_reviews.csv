Stayed over a week","We absolutely LOVED our stay! Jackie’s place was really beautiful and in a very walkable location. She thought of SO many details to make our stay comfortable - eco cleaning and toiletry products, heated floors, a shopping bag we could use to walk to the local co-op. She even left us a lovely welcome bowl with fruits and chocolates for our arrival. ☺️
We also really appreciated having parking on the premises! And on top of all this, Jackie was extremely proactive and responsive in her communication.
We will definitely stay here again when we’re in Madison!
Thank you for such a beautiful stay. ❤️"

Stayed about a week","We thoroughly enjoyed our week in Jackie's home. It was clean, well-provisioned, and comfortable. The hosts, who live just across a small yard, were friendly and responsive. The neighborhood is full of trees and peace, with short walks to a shopping street and parks and the lake. Because we're older, we would have appreciated some support at the steep front step and the claw foot tub, but Jackie was more than clear in her description and reiterated about accessibility in her messages. We cooked more than many might, and her kitchen supplies, such as dishes and cookware, were top-notch. For most, the small fridge is plenty, but we missed a regular fridge a little, especially after we visited the amazing farmer's market on the square! Thanks to Jackie and her husband for a restful stay!"

Stayed about a week","Overall, we enjoyed our stay at Jackie's place. The quality of the items provided/available in the kitchen were top notch, it was comfortable and clean. We had everything needed to make all meals there. It was extremely convenient to downtown or for us close to Alliant Energy Center for the CrossFit Games. There was a lake a short walk away and Willy's co-op was awesome for grocery food selections right around the corner. Jackie was responsive and friendly and helped make adjustments to our length of stay and amount of guests easily. You are in a small guest house behind her home but we didn't feel that it was an issue at all. We saw them here and there but still felt like we had our own space. Would recommend!"

This little home was the perfect place for us! It is impeccably styled, had everything we needed, and was in the best location. We loved morning walks by the lake to head downtown or a quick few steps to Madison Sourdough and Orton Park. Jackie was a fantastic host and made sure we had everything we needed and more. Thank you so much for a delightful Madison trip, we’ll be back!"

I arrived late at night and the lights were on, there were two different cheeses in the fridge, a nice box of craft crackers, and some wonderful chocolates. The location is awesome as you can walk to many restaurants, coffee shops, and the local grocery co-op, know as Willy Street Co-Op. The place is clean, quaint, comfortable, and well-stocked with anything you might need. I recommend Jackie's place if you're planning a stay in this iconic town. So much to do and so much fun."

Stayed about a week","The town of Madison is filled with adventure. We shopped at the Saturday Farmers Market and fed on fresh vegetables, constructed a charcuterie tray, and feasted on empenadas. But wait there is MORE, Willys Coop is a 5 minute walk and is fresh, healthy and caters to specific dietary needs. We enjoyed kayaking, biking, the Geology Museum, the Union, and took in the panoramic view at the top of the capital building. Thank you Jackie and Henry"

They even provided us with a welcome treat of crackers, cheese, chocolates, and cherries! The cottage is in an excellent location close to the capital with restaurants and grocery store within walking distance. An added benefit was to be only a block away from the annual Orton Park Festival! Bring your bicycles as Madison is a very bike friendly city with ready access to some great biking trails."

She gifted us with artisan snacks from the local co-op. The neighborhood is lovely and so many places within walking distance, my favorite was the beach, only one block away. Celeste who was managing the property at the time of our visit made sure we had everything we needed, she even set us up with a cooler and floaty’s for the beach and gave great suggestions for local restaurants. I highly recommend this Airbnb."

Stayed about a week","This place is absolutely adorable and pristine. The bedroom is surprisingly large for a cute little casita. It has impeccable design and taste, everything you could possibly need. The amenities all worked as described, and check in/out was easy as pie! I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone looking for a sweet, quaint spot with all the amenities you could need for a short term/monthly stay. Plus, it’s super luxe! A gorgeous seating area outside, beautiful kitchen countertops and trendy flooring, and heated floors. Totally luxurious, cozy and has a few sweet vintage touches like the bathroom sink/bathtub and such. I wish I could live here full time ;-)"

Restaurants, bakery, Saturday market are within easy walking distance. Touring the capitol and a visit to Tallisen AND all the cycling paths were highlights of our visit. The kitchen, while small is more than adequate for preparing simple meals. The cookware is top notch, better than what I have at home. Loved the casita and loved Madison."

Thoughtful touches throughout and a high design aesthetic- the photos do a great job conveying the sense of the space. Lovely amenities. Added bonus are the birds, squirrels and bunnies in the yard - a cardinal lives nearby and is around quite a bit - and with the windows and french doors that look out on the yard you take it all in with your coffee as you relax and unwind. A great getaway right in the city-"

The immediate neighborhood has plenty of dining and entertainment options and 2 playgrounds within a five minute walk. Jackie and her family were welcoming but gave us plenty of space to come and go. Perfect for a couple of friends, a romantic trip, or even a small family. Jackie left us thoughtful treats of local crackers and chocolates, a cheese board, refrigerated water, and fresh cherries. Her garden is delightful and we enjoyed the relaxing and artful design of the cottage."

Stayed a few nights","Fantastic space for an urban getaway. Tasteful and contemporary but very comfortable. Restful and quiet yet in the middle of a bustling and fun neighborhood, with many great food and entertainment options close by. Jackie the owner could not be more accommodating and thoughtful, from the welcome treats provided to the high-end kettle and press coffee gear (coffee provided!) to the beverages, you feel instantly welcome and cared for yet private and cozy. In nice weather, watch for the bunnies in the yard! Highly recommended."

Stayed a few nights","Strongly agree with the many very favorable reviews with the property’s well deserved 5 star ratings in all areas & Jackie’s well deserved super host rating. The rental is run very professionally with great communication, organization, attention to detail and caring. It was well stocked, had a neat, clean, helpful booklet on the local services. Enjoyable neighborhood with nice, old 2 story houses and with lived-in feeling rather than the more upscale, manicured lawn feeling of the north isthmus shore; the neighborhood vibe was reflected in a Hell’s Angel guy participating in a local yoga class at the nearby park. Definitely recommend."

The bed is super comfortable (something very important to me) and you have everything you need right there. Jackie left us local cheeses, chocolates and fresh fruit, which made our stay that much better. There was fresh coffee and cream, which also saved us expensive trips to the coffee shop. The neighborhood is quiet but trendy with tons of restaurants and shops within easy walking distance. We could not have asked for more and enjoyed our stay more than we expected. Jackie communicated quickly any time we needed to contact her. We needed to ask for help with something rather urgent and Jackie and our husband helped us immediately. If you’re staying in Madison, don’t waste your time looking elsewhere, this place has everything you’ll need and more. Thanks again for the excellent weekend getaway!"

Stayed a few nights","We stayed at Jackie's place over a weekend for the Ironman Triathlon that takes place in September. And this is seriously one of my favorite Airbnbs that I have stayed in. I think everything about it was just awesome.
The location is fantastic. It sits by the lake in a cool little neighborhood just off Williamson Street. Williamson St. has a great selection of coffee houses, restaurants, bars and stores only a couple of minutes walk away. Totally safe area to walk around, even after dark. It's only a 10-15 minute walk to the State Capital building in downtown and everything else in that area.
The place itself is a cozy two room place. One is a bed room, the other is a living room/dining room area. There's not really a kitchen to speak off, but an area with a fridge, sink, microwave, kettle and coffee maker - all we really needed as we ate out every night. It is stylishly decorated from local shops with an independent feel.
Jackie was the perfect host - friendly and communicative (even though we never met her in person). However it was the little personal touches that really made this place stand out. From her recommendation of local establishments to try out, to the cheese and cracker board she left out for us as a welcome present (local WI cheeses). As well as a little selection of locally made chocolates."

First, trust the pictures. This space is even more beautiful than they can convey. It was absolutely spotless throughout. Quality shampoo, conditioner, and soap was provided in the bathroom. Bring a bath bomb and a soak in the claw foot tub. Heaven.
There were two types of WI cheese, chocolates, crackers, and grapes waiting for us in the kitchen. Coffee, tea, cream were provided as well.
The bedroom is large and the bed and bedding are high quality and extremely comfortable. The host even put a vase of fresh roses on the dresser.
The living room is a bright, peaceful place to hang out. There is a TV here (also in the bedroom) which works with Roku. The patio off the living room is private and serene. It's the perfect place to have coffee in the morning, a glass of wine in the evening, and to read and relax throughout the day.
The neighborhood is walkable with the lake close by, and Williamson St. (Willy St.) just a few short blocks away. The host provided a detailed guide with area recommendations and directions. I had a car and the host provided a covered parking spot.
I will definitely be returning the next time I need a place to stay in Madison."

Stayed a few nights","Truly the loveliest most peaceful and welcoming AirBnB, our personal favorite. We were able to relax in the beautifully appointed living room, slept well in the relaxing bedroom, and enjoyed the French pressed coffee and Wisconsin cheese. The garden at the casita is lovely. Walkable neighborhood, with beautiful homes and parks along the lake. Great local restaurants, walked to Madison Sourdough for breakfast and El Dorado for dinner, highly recommend. Stopped (repeatedly) at Willy Coop Market. Can't wait to return."

Stayed a few nights","We wanted a quiet weekend, but with easy access to restaurants etc. What an enjoyable stay!
Jackie’s apartment was extremely comfortable, relaxing, private, clean, and beautifully appointed. The apartment is actually it's own free-standing building, and parking is easy and a few feet away from the front door. The apartment was very spacious for two guests. The living room is both roomy and cozy and has plenty of seating areas to lounge on. There are plenty of shelves to put your belongings, like phones, books, glasses, keys, etc. Everything is immaculately clean, including the sofa’s cushions, bed linens, bathrooms, towels, kitchen, and utensils. Sheets and pillows are wonderfully comfortable.
Jackie’s design of the space is aesthetically pleasing and unique, and every detail has been carefully chosen for both function and style. There is lots of closet space, hangers, wall hooks, drawers to organize your clothes. There is a hall closet well stocked with amenities, including extra pillows, comforter, ironing board, iron, etc. The kitchenette is fully stocked with cutlery, dishes, glasses, and all that you need to make coffee and tea, as well as amenities for tidying up (dish soap, sponge, garbage bags, dish rack, etc.). On the two TV's, there’s Netflix and Amazon Prime Video available. Jackie also provided high-end snacks, filtered water, coffee, teas, etc., as well as good quality soap, shampoo, and conditioner. There is a lot of attention to detail to ensure that guests are comfortable in their stay—a great mix of professional-grade functionality, thoughtful hospitality, and homey creature comfort.
The location of the apartment is superb. It’s quiet and private, so you can leave the window blinds open to let the sun stream into the living room. There are lovely birds singing outside. Two blocks away in one direction there’s the Monona lake front and two blocks away in the other direction there is Williamson (Willy) Street with tons of interesting restaurants, cafes, shops, and an excellent co-op supermarket.
Overall we had a very comfortable stay and confidently recommend this apartment to others."

The area is lovely -- quiet, residential, and a 2-minute walk to a stunning view of Lake Monona. It's also super close to really fun, hip shops, restaurants, and bars, making it an ideal destination for something looking to relax but also see a really cool, locally beloved of the city.
Really hope I have another excuse to get to Madison for another stay soon!"

He's a very interesting and intelligent man with lots of interests! I enjoyed talking to him a great deal! Next time I stay, it'll have to be in the spring and summer months when their garden is in full bloom. The location, the recommends, the accommodations, the artwork, the books...

I really appreciated the comfortable furniture and bed, art on the walls, the table for eating and working, chairs for enjoying the garden and fire, and using the kitchenette. There were also plenty of towels. One thing that's not explicitly included in the listing, which was a nice surprise, was a sturdy curtain with a latch and lock for securing the space while inside; this helped me feel like I had enough privacy to sleep well. As other reviewers mentioned, you can hear some noise upstairs when the hosts are on their main floor living space - which can be a problem if you go to bed early and you're a light sleeper."

My only recommendation would be to loosen the spring on the outer door, as it was difficult to hold open and being a smaller person, it was a bit hard to maneuver bags while going in and out. However, I would highly recommend and give this cozy place a 5 star rating!!! Thank you, Gregory! Warmly, Jody"

Stayed a few nights","Gregory's place is in a quiet, safe neighborhood a few miles (but an easy drive) to downtown Madison. He has provided menus for a least a dozen restaurants that are located within a mile of the house. We are very experienced Airbnb travelers and my husband rates Greg's place as his favorite! We had the entire lower level of the house to ourselves, which includes a very large living area with a gas fireplace and many floor to ceiling windows overlooking Greg's beautifully manicured flower gardens. He has an extensive book collection on the shelves (travel, art, architecture, Frank Lloyd Wright, pottery, fiction, classics, picture books, etc) so we could have been very happy staying there much longer to just enjoy his books and the view! His house is convenient to arteries leading to downtown Madison. Greg was a source of great suggestions about local events and great places to visit. We would definitely stay at Greg's house again!"

They offer brochures and listings of tourist info of Madison and surrounding area including menus of restaurants in the area. Nice amenities with Keurig coffee maker, snack bars, water and soda in mini frig and there’s also a micro. Mugs are provided as well as paper and plastic ware. The large windows and patio door allow gorgeous views and access to the beautiful garden and this time of year in full bloom!

This rental offers all the comforts of home, down to a curling iron, office supplies, and any kitchen gadget you can imagine. In addition to the natural and fragrance-free products, there is a supply of lotions and shampoos containing fragrances for guests who prefer those. The gracious host was very responsive to our communications.
This small space was the perfect size for the two of us, though anyone over 6 feet tall might feel cramped. This is a basement unit accessed through the shared sun room. The bed and pillows are comfortable. We enjoyed admiring the eclectic/historic art on the shelves and walls. Guests remove their shoes before entering the space, helping to keep it very clean.

Stayed a few nights","It was the perfect kid-free getaway for a couple of tired mamas. It is an adorable little basement apartment and has enough windows that it’s not too dark. It is blocks away from parks and a lakeside beach with a cute little ice cream shop. The neighborhood was beautiful and we spent some time just walking around. Lori did an amazing job on the decor and the landscaping and the little sunroom is a perfect spot to sit and sip your coffee in the morning.
It is about 15 minutes to downtown Madison by car but walk a few blocks in either direction and find beautiful views of the capitol across the lake. We had an amazing weekend!"

Stayed about a week","Lori is an absolutely fabulous host.
This was my second time staying at her property (a friend had booked with her for a trip we took to Madison in June 2022), so I knew exactly what to expect and how lovely the accommodations are for travel in Madison.
Less than three blocks from Lake Monona, easily accessible to downtown or the Beltline, not to mention all of the businesses along Monona Drive, this property lets you live like a local and soak up all that the east side has to offer.
The beds are extremely comfortable and have great linens, there is great water pressure, the kitchen is perfect for cooking meals (or warming up leftovers from any of your favorite Madison eateries), and the WiFi is strong if you need to do some work remotely.
I really appreciate Lori’s aesthetic, her gorgeous gardens, all the extra touches (menus, grocery discount card, labels on light switches and locks), and the sun porch. I’m only 5’5”, so the lower level apartment may feel short to someone much taller, but it is extremely cozy and I appreciate having access to natural light while inside.
In my opinion, it’s a definite must-stay if you are coming to Madison!"

The kitchen is well stocked, and the place itself has most everything you could need including a full office set up and streaming on the TV. I may have missed it in the listing but I didn’t realize the unit was in the basement and the sun room shown is at the top of the stairs separate from the u it rather than directly attached to it. It wasn’t a problem at all, just a little something I didn’t realize and worth mentioning in case anyone misses it like I did. The neighborhood is quiet, very beautiful and close to most things in town. Highly recommend staying at Lori’s!"

Stayed a few nights","We thoroughly enjoyed our 3 night stay! Lori has great attention to detail and anticipated any problems by having helpful signs and clear, concise instructions for TV, house rules, checkout etc. Lori really thinks of everything, so you can relax and feel right at home. The apartment was immaculately clean, and we loved the fun vintage decor. Plenty of room for 2 adults, as long as you aren't over 6' tall, as the ceilings are low. No problem for me and my 5' 10"" husband. The bed was comfortable, the office nook was handy and the wifi connectivity was good. The kitchen was well equipped for small scale cooking. The bathroom was very clean, well-lit and the shower had good water pressure and plenty of hot water and ample towels. Though the apartment is in the basement it is quiet, and it feels cozy and snug, not gloomy. There is also lovely sunroom upstairs, and a garden area outdoors, plus BBQ and fire pit. Early March isn't the best time of year for being outside, so we'll have to come back to make the most of those features :) The location worked well for our activities in Madison, everything was less than a 20 minute drive. In warmer weather we would definitely go check out the lake and the nearby bike trail. Overall, we couldn't have had a more pleasant stay and we hope to come back again--Many Thanks again, Lori!"

The place is so clean that even then kitchen sink is always sparkling. There is also an-amazing sunroom and a beautiful garden here, it’s really cool to sit in the sunroom and listen to the music, especially in rainy days. Will be back someday."

My wife and I spent a week there while visiting our daughter. It was very convenient for us as she lives only a couple of blocks away. It's also a quick drive to the airport, restaurants, groceries, etc.
The space itself is well laid out with comfortable furniture. The kitchen is well-stocked with dishes, pots, pans, and the like. There's a stove, oven, and microwave. Coffee machine and tea kettle as well. A nice large TV if you're into TV.
Some other reviews mention the two low spots in the ceiling. And they are there! But I'm 6'2"" and experienced no problems or head bumps.
We will definitely contact Lori next time we're staying in Monona or Madison!"

It is close enough to take walks around scenic Lake Monona, yet still be a 10-minute drive from being in Madison. The driveway parking spot and separate entrance allowed us to come and go during the day in between seeing Williamson St., State St., the State Capitol, both Monona Terrace and Memorial Union Terrace. Lori was communicative and provided instructions for anything we needed. We would gladly stay again!"

It has its own entrance, a little kitchen that has all the appliances and equipment we needed for making meals, and many thoughtful touches such as purified water in the fridge and nice quality towels in the bathroom. A wonderful benefit is the private use of a sun room overlooking the beautiful garden, from which Lori actually gave us a couple of plants to bring home!
Monona is a lush residential neighborhood and Lori's home is not far from the Olbrich Gardens. We came to Madison to visit our son who lives near downtown and the Capitol, which was about a 15-20 minute drive away.
We highly recommend Lori's place!"

Stayed a few nights","Dear Travelers,
We gave Lori the Ganzlin-Kilmer FIVE STAR GOLD AWARD, she could not have improved on anything, she achieved perfection in our opinion. Lori's guest suite and our visit was without a doubt the most wonderful Airbnb experience to date. I will also admit we have pretty high standards, Lori surpassed them all! :-)
Lori's guest suite is absolutely stunning, spotless, magically decorated like only Lori could do, I mean AMAZING décor! The bathroom is very roomy and spotless, the kitchen is perfect, spotless, well equipped right down the very thoughtful delicious breakfast items she provided.
Lori's beautiful glassed in sunroom was just that and so much more! Enjoying a glass of wine in her sunroom, and being in the middle of her amazing English Garden truly made us feel like royalty! My husband enjoyed an early career as a landscaper, we both marveled at how beautiful her garden was, AND, she did every single thing herself! It was truly magic.
While we were in the middle of town, we felt like we were in a little piece of heaven, it was so quiet and peaceful.
The best part was meeting Lori! We loved our visits, Lori is amazingly talented and has a beautiful heart and a warm welcoming smile.
We felt at home from the minute we arrived. :-)
Thank you Lori, you are invited to visit us in the Bay Area anytime, we look forward to our next visit.
Until then, THANK YOU LORI so many hugs coming your way.

Stayed a few nights","We loved our stay at Lori’s! We found it last minute after we cancelled a camping trip due to weather, and it was affordable and impressive. The apartment is very comfy and welcoming, with cute vintage decor and plenty of spare blankets (always something I love). The entire space was clean as a whistle, and everything you could ask for was provided. There is a queen bed, a twin bed, a working space with a printer, a cozy chair and a small breakfast table. Lots of storage space!
The kitchen sported a full coffee/tea set up, cookware and even some breakfast items in the fridge. We felt so at home that we chose to make dinner in both nights, rather than going out! There is a cute sunroom and amazing garden with seating to enjoy your morning meal.
The bathroom was fully stocked with shampoo, conditioner, lotion and body wash. Spare towels aplenty, a hairdryer and a basket full of emergency personal care items like tampons, a toothbrush, etc. It was a great touch!
Our absolute favorite thing about our stay was the amazingly comfortable bed! It was so cozy that we wished we were staying an extra day. Lori provided a space heater to keep us comfortable, and it was heaven. also the TV is huge and super fancy - we brought along our Roku so we could watch the Game of Thrones finale!
All in all, we give it an A+. Lori was just a message away and made sure we had all of the information we needed for our stay. Stay here!"

We ended up eating out, but kitchen is fully equipped should you want to cook. Appreciated the electric tea kettle for late-night tea. And on top of all that, Shaun runs a great cafe on the bottom floor of the building where we got fresh-baked scones or muffins — and free coffee! — for breakfast each morning. Very convenient and nice not to have to pick up breakfast supplies at the grocery store (or toss left-over food at the end of our stay). My only regret is that we didn’t have a chance to try out the ice cream parlor. Free coffee plus baked goods and ice cream on the premises — what more could you want?!"

The place was clean perfect for two people would not recommend more than that. If you are a light sleeper, then you might not want to stay here on a Friday or weekend as the bar next-door has loud music which can be heard in the apartment. One more thing I’m not sure if this was on the description. The apartment is on the third floor with very narrow staircase so if you require handicap accessible, this is on the third floor. Lastly, Shaun was accommodating on my check in time and check out which I appreciated since I had some delays."

Stayed about a week","I stayed at Shaun's for a week. I was returning to the Madison area after having lived there for years, so I was well aware of the community I was choosing--a small town that was close to everything, but still a peaceful small town. The thing that struck me the most about the lodging was what an incredible job they had done with updating a beautiful old building. Appliances and all utilities were absolutely state of the art, without harming the feel of the space. I will look for this host the next time I visit the Madison area."

It truly felt like a home away from home to relax and the cafe/ice cream right downstairs was a bonus perk. Until you actually leave the room, you’d never guess it was downstairs! If we visit Madison again, we will definitely seek our this spot again!"

Stayed a few nights","Clean, comfortable, well-appointed, and spacious place! Bed was super comfortable and kitchen was well stocked.
Something to consider, though — despite being on the third floor and not street-facing, you will hear traffic and car noise. Because the location is next to a railroad track, you can hear and feel the rumble every time a car drives over the tracks. Additionally, the bar next door plays music loudly outside until bar close.
If you’re a light sleeper, being ear plugs and a white noise machine.
Other than the outside noise, the place is great."

There was a train that went through a couple times during the night, but I fell right back to sleep because the bed is so amazingly comfortable! Shaun even checked in with me to make sure I got in on the first night and the next day to see

We accidentally stained the bath towels with color and are willing to pay for it. The host said that we didn't need to pay for it at all, and let us worry about it. It really touched us!Guests can enjoy complimentary coffee at the cafe downstairs every day, and every clerk is very friendly.Anyway, it was a particularly perfect stay and I will choose this place next time I come to Wisconsin."

The apartment was extremely clean, and Shaun provided all the kitchen and cleaning supplies that I needed. I loved the close proximity to downtown Madison and how easy it was to find parking right in front of the building every night. The only issue was that the building is right next to some train tracks, and there was the occasional late-night freight train, so just be aware if you're a light sleeper. Besides that, Shaun made me feel so comfortable and welcome at the McFarland House, and I really appreciated him proactively reaching out to me halfway through my stay to see if I needed anything. I would absolutely stay here again in the future!"

The neighborhood is ideally located for those looking to explore the isthmus. Parking is safe and easy - directly next to your apartment entrance. The house is on a quiet tree lined street with walkable access to both lakes. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom well appointed.
As a bonus, Jennifer and her family invited my dog up to their home when I was away at dinner to keep him company. (With my permission, of course). A lovely family and a lovely stay! We’ll be back!"

Incredible location, walking distance to lots of cool spots! Shower was heavenly and the ability to use the laundry machine was great. Many Airbnb’s request you to do many chores despite a cleaning fee, whereas this rental only asks you to clean your dishes. There are a few suggestions I may have to make this space incredible- it is listed as self check in, however, Jennifer asks to meet with you/greet you prior to checking in and giving you the code. It is a safety measure that I totally respect- it looks like other reviewers appreciate being greeted. However, I had a busy day, didn’t check airbnb inbox to see that this meeting was required prior to receiving the code. My in laws got there early & had to wait. I also recommend mounting the antenna to the wall and including directions for the tv, as we were having signal issues."

We didn't cook but the kitchen was well stocked (even with spices!). The room darkening shades and quality bedding made for a good night's sleep. Jennifer was very responsive to our every request and even let us check out a bit late. Highly recommend this lovely home away from home."

Stayed a few nights","Highly recommend this cute 2 bedroom flat! The location is great in a quiet safe neighborhood within walking distance of the capitol square. Plenty of bedroom and shared living space to enjoy a comfortable stay rather than cramped in a hotel room. Easy access to the airport as well as highways to visit any spot in the greater Madison area and beyond. The hosts are wonderful people, kind and very attentive to questions as well as flexible to guest needs. I would absolutely stay here again!"

Group trip","Jennifer’s place is a gem. Two bedrooms plus a rollaway bed made it comfortable for a small group. The pour over coffee maker, detailed guest guide, countless USB ports near the beds, comfy sitting area, and other thoughtful touches made it much more of a vacation than just a place to sleep. Jennifer and her family were fantastic; super polite, friendly, helpful and gracious as hosts. They don’t want to intrude on your stay and it shows with how much effort they’ve put into soundproofing the Airbnb space. We never once heard the family above us, not even footsteps. Please treat them and their space with the same respect they so obviously have put into being great hosts!
It’s a short walk to a great coffee shop nearby with excellent breakfast options. Admire the neighbors koi pond and generally beautiful neighborhood along the way.
Thank you Jennifer, we loved our stay."

Stayed with kids","Great trip to Madison. Jennifer's basement apartment was perfect for us -- we brought our almost-four-year-old and our 6 month old baby. She provided a pack n play and even toddler utensils. Beds and pillows were unusually comfortable. Sound machines in each bedroom provided some great white noise for the baby's sleep. Also great to have a washer and dryer for baby things. It was easy to watch our children there. The central location (isthmus) was convenient for our purposes -- we were house hunting and towed our kids with us to 12 properties all around the Madison suburbs (every direction!). Great coffee nearby at Johnson Public House, and also within walking distance of some tasty restaurants. The only difficulty we had was trying to find diapers at 9pm. My husband ended up at some campus Target, then a Walgreens, both of which only catered to college students. We were probably just looking in the wrong places. Very glad to stay at this home, and would definitely recommend her place for families like ours!"

Stayed with kids","We came to Madison for the Ironman Triathlon and stayed in Jennifer and Andrew’s home for 5 nights. We appreciated having all the toys for our young daughter and the backyard made our stay that much nicer. Check-in was super simple, and though the home shows its age, it added to the charm of being in such a cute city where most of the other homes are character/heritage houses. So we felt a bit like locals staying here. We didn’t get dirty feet from walking around in bare feet like some places we have stayed in. When we wiped the bathroom floor after a splash from bath time, the towel was clean. In other words, the place was very clean. We had plenty of hot water and the climate control is very efficient. Jennifer and Andrew were very generous in offering their spices and other cooking basics to us. They even offered to put up a child safety gate on the stairs for us, and provided a high chair. There is no microwave, but with a bit of planning, the toaster oven managed
the job fine. Thank-you for hosting us!"

We didn't miss it, and our family members who wanted to watch the games that were on during our stay found it a convenient reason to explore LJ's sports pub 2 blocks away. While the home does have 3 bedrooms, some of the beds leave something to be desired.

Stayed over a week","Jordan is one of the very best hosts I've dealt with. He obviously knows what he's doing and goes to great lengths to get the details right.
Jordan provided excellent instructions for check-in. There's a code-activated lock on the door, which worked perfectly until I inadvertently locked the deadbolt (when it was dark and getting cold. No problem - Jordan had me in in a few minutes).
The space was spotlessly clean and well-supplied with linens, towels, coffee, etc. I had a few questions about how things worked and Jordan replied with detailed answers in 5 minutes. Great host.
The neighborhood is OK...I called it walkable in the review but that's only true if you're willing to walk for 20 minutes to the supermarket. There is a great gym a 15-minute walk away and it's worth it (best gym I've ever seen).
The only negative comment is I don't think the place is a good value for what you get. Kind of a last-minute booking for me."

Stayed a few nights","This was my second time staying with Jordan and I would happily return. Jordan is a reliable, friendly host. It's an attic level space, so as others have mentioned if you're very tall, watch your head. However, I find the compactness cozy and appreciate that the space has everything I need for a visit to Madison. The bed and sheets are very comfortable and the space heater/fireplace feature does the trick on a cold night. The location is really convenient to the trail system and parking is a breeze."

Stayed a few nights","There was much to appreciate about Jordan’s Cape Cod BnB. Nightimes were very quiet, without much auto traffic and no airplanes in/out of the nearby Madison airport. (It should be noted that airplanes were loud during daytime, especially occasional flights of fighter jets.) Appliances worked well, and we enjoyed the wall-mounted electric fireplace for its light and warmth. The stairs were manageable, as pictured in the web views. But the shower could be risky for people with physical limits. We had some difficulty with the angled ceilings (it would be especially difficult for tall people). Bed and blankets were comfortable. Our only suggestion is that a basket of crackers or fruit would be nice for tired, hungry arrivals. There is coffee/tea, but one would have to run out for any food. The price was right and access was easy via the Schlage lock system."

Stayed one night","We have rented the whole house 2x and just needed an extra night when the downstairs wasn't available, so we took the upstairs alone. It's a great ""hotel"" space with some homey touches and more amenities than a hotel. I do think it would be helpful to know going in that this space has ample room in the sleeping/kitchen area. The shower is small (less than 3' square). The ceilings are slanted as it is the upstairs of a bungalow. It is accessible only by steps. I'm 5'6"" and had no issues with ceiling height or the shower. My husband is 6' and was unable to comfortably stand to use the toilet due to the pitch of the ceiling. It really is a perfect overnight accomodation."

The place was exactly what we needed: places to sleep, a table to sit at and enjoy some farmer's market goodies, and a lovely outdoor space. The highlight was definitely the outdoor space. The two hanging chairs were especially nice to enjoy some tea on. There was plenty of street space for parking and check in was a breeze. Thank you Jordan for letting us enjoy one of my new favorite cities in such a welcoming place."

Stayed a few nights","What a great place to lay your head. The area felt safe and you can not find a better price for that close to downtown Madison. The downstairs unit is also an airbnb but we didn't hear anything from our upstairs unit so it was very quiet. It was exceptionally clean, and the linens smelled nice and weren't startchy.
The loft is not gonna be a place you bring your friends to hang out nor was it meant to be. It is a small space, but it is exactly what I was expecting from the pictures. I'm 6'3"" so definitely had to watch my head when going up the stairs (and when going to the bathroom), but plenty of headroom for everything else.
The amenities were exactly as described and great! When we arrived into town it was 15 degrees, but the heater warmed up in no time and it was nice and toasty.
The host was very accommodating and responsive. The directions for checking in were simply and easy to follow.
If you're looking for a great place to lay your head in Madison this is the place!"

Only minutes away from pretty much everything you could need, the loft is in a great location. Restaurants nearby? Check! Shopping close? You bet! Entertainment? Check out the Sylvee! Nightlife? Lots of cozy nightspots litter the nearby landscape! History? The Capitol building (and the surrounding area) is merely minutes away by car!
Jordan was an excellent host; we had the opportunity to chat with him on multiple days of our trip and he was always very gracious and kind. We loved the loft and hope to stay there again soon! Thanks, Jordan! :)"

It definitely has parts where it is shorter but nothing unbearable. My 6ft husband didn’t have any troubles. The beds are spaced out enough from the ceiling so you don’t whack yourself when you get up. The bed was the softest and warmest bed we have stayed at ever! Plus you can open the windows if you want for a nice breeze.

Easy 10-15 drive to Capital/Campus area.
Thanks for having us!"

Stayed with kids","My wife and, 6 year old daughter, and I came to Madison for the weekend for a Badgers football game. We arrived Friday afternoon and stayed until Monday morning. Everything about the stay was so easy. Check in and check out, finding the place (even with construction all around the neighborhood), getting Ubers to pick up and drop off. It was close to everything. 15 minutes from Campus, about 10 minutes from the zoo, 55 minutes from New Glarus Brewing. We packed a lot of fun, and a lot of relaxing in the place, over the extended weekend. Will try to find this place again next time we come to town."

We were also able to walk to a few restaurants/bars and sites. The closest was a 7 minute walk (a Thai restaurant) and the furthest we walked was 30 minutes (olbrich Biergarten and botanical garden). The area was safe! The room seemed more spacious than I expected from the pictures! Jordan replied quickly when needed but luckily we didn’t have many questions. Great stay!

There is an awesome paved off-road trail at the end of the street that takes you right into Downtown, and fortunately Jordan provides complementary bikes! So basically the entire City of Madison was my oyster! The complementary bikes enabled a week of joyful transportation in a new city, and surely saved me a ton of money on bus fare/rideshare. Loft was clean, beds were comfy, and Jordan was a responsive and kind host. Really great value for the price. Will definitely book again next time I'm in Madison."

Stayed a few nights","I was fortunate to find this place available when another AirBnB had a faulty hot water problem. It was a blessing! Clean and well laid out, full of great amenities, and great hosts! I enjoyed the upper east parts of Madison nearby. There is a great arboretum and garden nearby as well as many small lakes and parks. Parking was never a problem. The kitchen was fully stocked making it easy to cook meals. The washer and dryer were also easy to access and a great asset. Thanks for hosting me and making my stay excellent!"

Stayed with a pet","We had a fabulous time staying at Tim and Emily's house. It was sunny and inviting, a great place to hang out. And the coffee shop, bakery, and 2 restaurants less than a block away really added to our enjoyment. It does require jumping in the car to get to downtown or UWI but we knew that and the tradeoff of being in such a comfortable and walkable area was totally worth it. We'd definitely stay there again."

Stayed a few nights","We shared this lovely house with another couple, and it was a great fit. Unfortunately we were visiting Madison for a friends memorial, but having a nice place to gather and socialize provided a refuge.
The house was clean, well stocked and comfortable. The neighborhood had very good eating selections and there were great places to walk.
We very much enjoyed our stay, and would happily do it again!"

The basement door didn't close though which was an issue since we were traveling with our two small kids. The host knew about the issue and said to put a chair in front of it. I suppose it worked, but it was nerve wrecking."

Stayed with a pet","We were traveling to Madison during a very intense heat wave with smoke/air quality advisories with our 2 senior pups and this place was great at not only keeping us cool but our elderly dogs.
The neighborhood was great to walk them around with the large shade trees. We thoroughly enjoyed being so close to different eating options as well. We walked to the coffee/pastry shop (Café Domestique) one morning then Ogden's North Street Diner the next (small, loud and def surrounded by regulars, but worth the wait. Next time we will try to hit the Young Blood Beer Company (inside same building the coffee shop is) and Tip Top Tavern since they too were only one block away and had a shaded dog friendly patio.
The unit was just what we were looking for. Cool, spacious, and in a quiet neighborhood. I made a couple recommendations while we stayed and the hosts noted them positively. There is def noise from the upstairs but it was stated in the listing when we booked so it was not a surprise."

Stayed with a pet","We had a great stay at Tim and Emily’s place! It’s in a great neighborhood and is walking distance to parks, coffee shops, bars and restaurants and is short driving distance to downtown. You can’t beat the location! It already had a Pack and Play, mattress and sheets so it was nice to have one less thing to worry about. The house was very clean and cozy.
When we arrived, we parked in the driveway while we were unloading our car and received a message right away about not parking in the driveway. We were planning on moving the car after we unloaded but it made us feel like we were being watched."

Stayed a few nights","5 Stars! Tim & Emily’s place on Commercial Ave was perfect. My highest priority is clean, and it was super clean. Everything worked great, & it was decorated nicely. Kitchen has newer appliances and a coffee station with programmable coffee maker, which was a bonus. The 2 queen beds were both comfy, and there were lots of pillows. They even had extension cords on both sides of the bed to plug in our cell phones. Very thoughtful.
Plenty of street parking, and it’s in a great location. Easy access to downtown and the Beltline. Super cute house with door code to get in and out easily.
When we’re in Madison again, we will definitely look up Tim & Emily. Great hosts!"

Stayed a few nights","Just a terrific place. 10 minute drive to downtown. Spotless, very comfortable beds and furniture, fully stocked kitchen. I was visited my son at UW and it was important to me to be able to cook for him. The kitchen was absolutely set up for that. The host was extremely responsive and helpful.
The neighborhood was pretty quiet, with a terrific coffee place and high-calibre diner (open only for breakfast & lunch), literally on the next corner.
It was very easy to work remotely here as well.
Highly recommend."

This place is really great for one or two couples/friends to share. The surrounding area, aside from downtown, has plenty of parks to hangout. It was nice being in a suburb area that was clean and peaceful. I absolutely would stay here again."

It was close enough to walk home for lunch or just a break with nice restaurants, coffee shop and farm to table take out along the way. It was a quiet peaceful place to rest while a loved one was in the hospital. Emily always answered and quickly solved an issue with the city shutting down the water. Many many thanks to her.
The place was clean and comfortable and had everything we needed in a temporary home. There was a steep stairs to get in but once in she provided."

One of the bedrooms is directly above the stairwell to the units so I could hear every time someone came in or out. I’m a light sleeper though… my husband never heard a thing. Otherwise, it was a pretty quiet building. We enjoyed our stay!"

Stayed with a pet","This apartment was cute, well furnished and supplied with pots/pans/dishes/glasses and cleaning supplies. Emily was kind enough to leave bus passes, coins for laundry as well as laundry detergent, snacks, milk/butter/olive oil/coffee to get started! Apartment was walking distance to bar/restaurants nearby as well as UW hospital where I worked. Emily was very open and honest about maintenance issues and gave ample notice of when theyay need to come into the apartment. Emily also took into consideration that I worked nights, and made sure maintenance respected my need to sleep during the day. Emily checked in frequently throughout my stay to see how everything was going. At the end of my stay, Emily was flexible in my checkout date and refunded me for nights I no longer needed the rental. I would give Emily 5 stars as a host and would rent from her in the future."
