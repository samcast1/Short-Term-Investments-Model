Stayed a few nights","This was the perfect landing spot for hiking in the area. We loved the rental which was on a farm with sheep, chickens, a small horse/pony or mule. We had lots of privacy and the host was truly amazing with immediate correspondence when I sent an inquiry. The farm fresh chicken eggs provided were delicious and such a nice surprise. Thank you so much and if I’m in the area again this will be the first place I reach out to."

Stayed about a week","Charity and Ben’s place is perfect if you’re looking for privacy along with peace and quiet. It was great being able to see the sheep and donkey each morning when we started our day. Another really neat feature of this property is the use of the garage to park your vehicle. I have never had this at any other AIR BNB I have stayed and I can say it was quite convenient. Overall, the property is a great value and exactly as described. Would definitely stay again."

Group trip","We enjoyed our time in Naomi's lovely airbnb so much! It's in a very safe neighborhood with a garage stall to park your car in! A first for us after 28 airbnb rentals! The home has a soothing color scheme, with beautiful decor and is free of clutter. The kitchen was a great place to cook and gather with family, as well as the front porch and back deck. We even took several walks throughout the neighborhood and felt safe and at ease. The bed and pillows were super comfy with a ceiling fan in the master bedroom for a nice little breeze while we slept. Naomi is a friendly and responsive host and I would definitively stay in her lovely home again. Thank you Naomi for creating a wonderful home away from home!"

Stayed with kids","Staying at Naomi’s home was an excellent choice for my family. We had 6 people total: myself and my husband, our two kids, and my in-laws. The size was perfect and comfortable for all of us.
The house was super clean and comfortable. You can tell it was recently renovated and she chose terrific furniture and decor.
We stayed for a few nights to celebrate my grandpa’s 90th birthday. It was nice to be able to cook in the kitchen and have access to a full size refrigerator.
I would definitely recommend this house to anyone in need of a comfortable and clean place to stay in West Plains. Also has a sister posting to rent the basement if you need more room."

Stayed one night","This place looks incredible. There were conveniences I never would have noticed from the pictures - like a smart heated and lighted mirror, a bath bomb, make up remover towels to name a few. Everything in the house was tastefully updated! After a long day spent outdoors the tub was so nice! I appreciated that anything that was provided to use on skin was extra soft - like the towels, the blankets, bedding, pillows. And I always appreciate when the hosts think of providing Q-tips! The framed pictures of famous people from West Plains was such a fun idea and so memorable. I loved the laundry setup with the stone folding table. We’re doing a home renovation right now and I was taking notes! They did such a great job with the place. If we had our kids with us there would have still been plenty of room for all 5 of us and even one more. There’s a whole table designated for local recommendations, handbooks and WiFi and I even noticed a little office nook with a printer. The fireplace was such a bonus feature as well. Naomi was super responsive and friendly. Our experience was wonderful and the home is a total gem!"

I was a little nervous that the home would be hot since it didn't have central AC, but the window units did a great job and we were always comfortable! We definitely would stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","Full disclosure, I made the reservation for my boyfriend, so this is second hand knowledge. He had no trouble finding it with clear entry information. It’s brand new, immaculate, and has everything he needed, including a washer and dryer, which was much appreciated. The bed was very comfortable. The most important thing was how responsive Caitlin was. I don’t think I ever waited more than 15 minutes for an answer. In addition, she was really flexible about check in and check out dates. My boyfriend told me the wrong date to start which was easily fixed. His purpose there was cut short, and he had to leave early. Caitlin was amazingly accommodating about that. I did let her know that on the front end that it might happen, but she went above and beyond. My boyfriend thought it was such a great place, that he told the educator with whom he worked to recommend this listing to future students. If my boyfriend goes back there, I will definitely try to book it again."

Stayed over a week","Made a mistake booking here. Their policy is to enter your living space and clean once a week. It’s my fault for not reading the policy as carefully as I should have but nevertheless, I did not want to have a stranger in my personal space. When I asked if they would stay out of my living quarters, I was told to not take it personally. They continued to enter and on top of that charged 50$ a week for the unsolicited cleaning service. It’s a real shame too because the house itself is warm, comfortable and very nice overall. It’s also conveniently located very close to the hospital which is fantastic for travel nurses, but I wish I’d chosen some place else to stay. Ended up canceling early with no guarantee of getting my money back."

Stayed with kids","Adorable little house. Perfect for our family of 5 for an overnight stay. Would have accommodated our extended family, for a total of 8, if they had been able to join us. Cute rooms, plenty of beds and seating. Wifi and roku TV provided. We ordered Dairy Queen and had it delivered (not something we can do in our little Iowa town). The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because I'm a light sleeper and the master is closest to a decently busy road. All in all, however, I would book this place again, in a heartbeat."

During our stay the central AC was out which we did not know until checking in. Even though they did have a window unit in the front room the bedrooms were hot and stuffy so we ended up sleeping on the couches to be able to stay comfortably cool.

Stayed a few nights","Chelsea was very accommodating! Came down for a rehearsal dinner and wedding. Needed 3 of her townhomes for me and relatives and she provided 2 adjoining and 1 across the street. Super fun to be able to walk across street to see nephews n nieces whom I haven't seen since going into Air Force. Also, due to timing of flight and rehearsal at 4pm, we wanted to chk in early to shower and get gussied up. Chelsea allowed early chk in so we didn't feel rushed. Very easy chk in process. Very clean open concept, exactly as described. Plenty of towels n hot water for all! I can only speak about my king size bed and it was comfy! I didn't hear anyone complain about theirs, LOL. Only issue I was not prepared for first night is the horn from train through the stillness of countryside. Second night ear plugs made me sleep like a baby, LOL! Highly recommend if you come near here!"

If you’re a light sleeper, bring ear plugs and sleep mask. Trains (about a half mile away) come through town throughout the night blaring their horns. We kind of got used to it by the time we left. The bedrooms have blinds but get bright as the sun comes up.
With that said, we plan on booking here again for our next visit in a few months."

King size bed with a good mattress and pillows, which I find is sometimes hard to come by in an rental. Nicely decorated. Front porch to watch beautiful sunsets. A fire pit, firewood included with chairs surrounding it sitting by a little pond. Owners were prompt with reply’s to any questions. Wished I could have stayed longer."

Stayed with a pet","Great option if you are looking for some space and relaxation. It is well laid out and nicely decorated. The best part is the night sky and seeing all of the stars and planets. The kitchen works for some basic cooking but may be a disappointment for those who really like to cook. There was no way to set the oven temp accurately. There are pots and pans and dishes but you will need to bring all food supplies because there are only a couple of spices, coffee filters and paper towels. There is another AirBnB just a few feet away so you don't have the area completely to yourself."

Stayed a few nights","Not enough can be said about the incredible drive and hard work poured into this property. You can tell the majority of the place was made by hand — from the ceiling panels to the hand-stained trim, to the numerous homemade decor/furniture, to the lights installed in the towering pine trees above the fire-pit, and much more. The rustic, homemade nature theme of the place makes you feel right at home! Not only is the “Shouse” beautifully made with plenty utilities/amenities (such as a fireplace heater and access to Roku), but it also manages to be mostly secluded while resting only about 10-15mins into town. The only downside is that the Shouse rests close to a moderately travelled road, so it can get a bit noisy at times — but it’s quiet for the most part. Overall, we really enjoyed the place and would definitely pick one of Pat&Rita’s properties again!!!"

Stayed a few nights","Great house - beautiful and has so many cute touches to it. My dog loved it too….lots of care spent on the inside of it.
Downside:
1) we could hear Construction happening every morning during our stay and it occurred literally behind the house. It seems like they’re expanding which is great but if you do not want to be awakened early in the morning, this may be an issue for some. For us… not really an issue.
2) No hose outside - so will make it hard to clean grill for future guests that come as it was very dirty requiring lots of cleaning bfore use.
3) Parking is conveniently located on property but its unshaded so if you have leather seats and it’s a hot day it will make it uncomfortable to sit in there."

With the eclipse stretching local motel room availability, my long-time buddy Tom suddenly had no place to stay. Vicky immediately okayed having him stay with us in the second bedroom of the Airbnb, so the next day's eclipse experience was perfect for all. Thanks for everything, Vicky!"

The guest house is tucked back from the main house, so it feels really safe and private. Plenty of parking. It also right by a section of the ozark scenic byway, so the area is gorgeous.
Vicky herself is an absolute gem of a person. She is generous, kind and informative.

(My mom had suffered stroke-like attack a few years ago causing her mobility and speech to deteriorate). We booked the place at the last minute after the heat stopped working at a previous place.

Stayed with kids","Vicki thank you for such a wonderful stay! We all appreciated the snacks upon arriving. This place was SPOTLESS and had EVERYTHING you would need for your stay. We were a little concerned with Covid as to what we would experience, but you took such amazing preparations to ensure our safety. We will definitely be coming back to visit. George and Mia will be missed! Thanks again and we’ll see ya soon!! TRAVELERS: You MUST stay here if you are in the area!! This location is very safe, extremely clean, has everything you would need as if you were home. There’s WIFI which was much appreciated as we have Verizon which doesn’t get great service in the Ozarks. Less than 10 min from town. You won’t regret staying here!!"

Stayed a few nights","Gorgeous place. I grew up in Missouri but have been moved to other states for years...so mean what I say when I say she has the perfect location. Not too far out to be out of cell coverage and WiFi is included. I was able to not only get coverage, but more than enough to complete my online college work. It is not too far from town. Also not far from multiple rivers. Amazing and quiet place to take the family and enjoy the quiet. The only thing that would have made it better was if there was a washer and dryer. I'll be more than happy to stay here again."

Stayed with kids","This is a terrific value and a terrific host. We will stay here again in the fall.
Our family was worried about coronavirus, and our host was very thoughtful and placed cleanliness above all. We were very comfortable in her very well-kept home, and we felt completely safe in this location. This area of the country and state has very, very little coronavirus activity and it is ten minutes from a hospital should you need it. It is simply perfect anytime, but especially right now.
This home is perfectly located to take advantage of all sorts of ourdoor activities and state and national parks/forests. It is located within a hour or so of a half-dozen beautiful blue springs and swimming holes and as many picturesque, old mills.
This home is located 15 minutes from several restaurants in West Plains, Missouri (we liked Kiko Japaneses and Bottleggers BBQ) and 45 minutes from Ava, Missouri, where we liked Oxaca Mexican, and Hucklebuck BBQ.
The hosts were very thoughtful of our needs and daughter. They were super responsive and respective. We can't wait to return."

Fortunately for me, there wasn't anything for me to worry about. Keri and Steve had everything covered. Just a quick trip to the grocery for some perishables and I was good to go. They also allowed early check-in, which I thought was very generous of them. I was looking for a quiet and private weekend, and I definitely got it, just as advertised. Very satisfied, I would definitely recommend."

It was so peaceful and the home was very comfortable. We were warmly greeted by Steven (and sweet puppy, Sadie!) when we arrived. The owners were incredibly respectful of our privacy and encouraged us to explore shared farm property. We especially enjoyed watching a mama cow and her calf graze nearby! We felt we could easily get in touch with the owners, however we didn't need anything during our short stay, everything was thought of! The home was immaculately clean, the WIFI was strong, and we slept great. If ever we return this area, there is no question we would stay with Keri & Steven again."

We loved having our morning coffee on the covered back porch and watching the birds, squirrels, even a nearby groundhog (?) and the neighbor's cute dog. Its close to everything and super accessible. Carol has put together an excellent guide for places nearby to eat and visit. The playground right around the corner was the icing on the cake! Thanks again Carol and Mike!

There was plenty of room for everyone and they had age appropriate toys for our youngest two children. There is a small park just a short walk from the house where we were able to say goodbye to our family before we headed back home. The area was quiet enough for coffee and donuts on the back porch in the morning for breakfast. They were kind enough to have plenty of snacks in the cupboard and the bathroom was fully stocked with anything you might have forgotten to pack. I’d give 20 stars if I could!

Stayed about a week","This Airbnb was so clean and well appointed. It had everything anyone would need and felt just like home. It’s extremely convenient to downtown, close to great restaurants, stores, and tourist areas. Their beds were super comfortable, the kitchen had everything you needed to cook and other items if you forgot to bring something from home. Their bath towels were big and luxurious with additional personal bath items to make you feel like you were at a spa. Loved the selections for watching TV after spending time visiting a family member in a nursing home. The back porch patio had a lot of room to sit outside in the mornings to drink coffee. I would highly recommend staying here, you will not be disappointed. Thanks Carol and Mike for sharing your home with us!"

Stayed a few nights","The kitchen is fully stocked with anything you might need, plus there were snacks to grab, which was a nice touch after a long ride from airport.
There is a large laundry room at the back entrance with a private bathroom.
The living room was a cozy place to sit and watch a movie. The large dining room table was great for our card game.
The bedrooms are wonderful, and each one unique with luggage stands. My friends each picked a bed. One was chosen because it was lower to the ground, and one was chosen because it had the softest mattress. You’d have thought I had the three bears with me from Goldilocks.
The bathroom is large with anything you may have forgotten. The towels are large and soft.
There were houses close to downtown but I remembered the annoying train that runs through that area. So if you’re looking for a place I can honestly say based on price, location and amenities this is it. Your are just two quick turns to the main road that leads everywhere and it’s quiet."

She even messaged me short time after checkout to let me know an item had been left, so we were able to get it. Would highly recommend this property!"

The temperature dropped into the 20s each night of our stay and the house was very warm with not hint of a cold draft. The owners have done a very good job with this property."

Stayed a few nights","This place is a jewel! Truly a ‘home’ away from home! It was beautiful and comfortable. Quite a find! Carol was amazing in meeting our every need, along with those needs we didn’t even think of! I was stunned at a post-it note on the fridge saying ‘you’re welcome to anything in the cupboards and fridge.’ Unbelievably generous! 5 stars for sure!!"

Stayed a few nights","This was the perfect location for my visit “home”. We were visiting family in the area and this home gave us a great space to visit as well as relax. I enjoyed running in the mornings in the neighborhood. I also know there is a nearby walking park but the neighborhood was safe and friendly. The house was immaculately clean and the hosts provided so many extra touches! Snacks, many charging stations, and back yard bag boards are just a few. We enjoyed our stay and we are hoping to stay again next year."

Stayed a few nights","Very nice place to stay. The hosts have put a lot of thought into so many extra touches to make sure their guests are comfortable. Home was located close to the main roads, but far enough away & on a large lot so it had a country feel to it. We were only there for a couple of nights & were only in town for a funeral, BUT, if we ever find ourselves in West Plains again we would totally stay here! Thanks Carol & Mike!"

Stayed a few nights","Oh my goodness!!! I can’t say enough about how wonderful this place is!! We were in town to help my dad move from his farm to a house in town. After a flight delay we got in at 11:00pm tired and hungry with no food the next morning for breakfast.
Then we see a note on the fridge that the food in the refrigerator and in the cabinets were for us!!! Milk, juice, yogurt, bottled water, pop tarts, cereal and even nutty bars!!!
The place we so clean and the beds were actually comfortable!!! Especially after a loooong day of cleaning out and packing!!
We will most definitely be staying here on our next visit!!!!
Thank you!

Furnished with everything you might need during your stay, such as cleaning supplies, trash bags, laundry detergent, extra paper products, etc. Also conveniently equipped with a clothes steamer, hangers, and lots of kitchen equipment which we used and enjoyed! We felt safe and enjoyed the cornhole game that was available! The host was kind and quickly attended us when we locked ourselves out one night. We highly recommend this place and hope to stay here again sometime!"

The stove is great we made a whole Thanksgiving meal here; love the broiler looks like a pan storage area. Very quiet comfortable and safe area. The host is just as warm, welcoming and inviting as the home itself."

We traveled with two babies; there were toys, a pack & play, puzzles. The house itself was perfect for our stay; cozy, comfy beds & linens. Overall we were so pleased.
