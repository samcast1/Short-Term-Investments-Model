Stayed a few nights","Our second stay there in the last 2 years, so that should say a lot! Interior space was fun & funky; made me think of my artsy girl friends places back in college who knew how to make old, quirky abodes an art-filled delight. The building is an old storefront on the groundfloor with a walk-up apartment above. Everything is well maintained & upgraded. Loved the clawfoot tub! The area has plenty of cool restaurants, bars & cafes withing walking distance. The Lake is an easy walk, too. You'll enjoy this place!"

Stayed one night",This is my second time staying at this apartment. It’s just cute and cozy. I love all the eccentric decor and the cute little shop downstairs. Located right downtown and within walking distance to several restaurants and bars. We were in town for a wedding and unfortunately didn’t spend much time in the apartment but the bed was comfortable and we really enjoy having our own private space when we travel.

Stayed with kids","Overall, a good one night stay! It was a cute spot that was decorated well, and the back patio was great. I would have liked some heads up that the apartment is on top of a store, and that there are a good amount of stairs to get into the place. We have a toddler, so the stairs were a bit daunting at first. However, there was a food that separated the stairs, so overall toddler friendly. Tina was great and very friendly! Overall, I would recommend this place!"

Sheboygan itself is an extremely bikable city and Tina's location lends itself as a great launch pad for anywhere that you want to go. We will definitely consider her location again, should we make a return trip."

With that said I'd like to note that earplugs and a white noise machine was provided at the bedside. The apartment was well stocked with staple items and the basics.

Stayed one night","Tina was friendly and helpful to communicate with via text. Her listing is easy to find and access, and convenient to downtown locations. The downtown neighborhood was noisy as was expected on a Friday night, and very brightly lit, but manageable. The only downside was the strong incense odor that permeated the space and clung to our clothing even after we got home. If you are OK with strong scents, you'll be fine. If not, you should choose another spot."

Group trip","Tina’s place was fantastic. Easy access on foot to everything cool about Sheboygan. Great music, nightlife, cafes and restaurants nearby. The place itself was very creatively rehabbed, with lots of modern amenities, but not HGTV-overdone. It’s an apartment over an old storefront, and most of the old fixtures—like the old solid wood doors & floors—are still there, just restored tastefully. Tina has a very artful eye that she has tastefully applied to the interior decoration here—quite a treat for anyone lucky enough to stay here!"

Stayed about a week","This is a place of trade-offs. It's in a great, central location in town, within walking distance to the lake and downtown. But that same central location tended to attract a bit of noise on some days, even in the middle of the night. I stayed long enough to get used to it. Additionally, since it's on a main street in town, street parking is not free on weekdays. But I managed to find street parking on a quiet road a block south, not too far away (within visual of the kitchen window). Again, I got used to it, because the benefit of the good location outweighed it for me.
However, if you do visit in the summer, know that using the rear bedroom might be a hot experience for you. The kitchen radiates heat, which essentially cuts off that bedroom from the rest of the air circulating through the apartment, even if the A/C in the living room is on and/or the windows open.
But all that aside, you should have all that you'll need. I stayed an entire week (spending most of the daytime out and about), and I had no reason to need anything else."

Stayed one night","We have stayed in quite a few airbnbs, but never felt so pleasantly welcomed into someone's home. They key here is you are actually in someone's home; there is no door separating your rooms from from the owner's. But Kathleen has a natural gift for making you feel at home. Furnishings are top quality, the space is large and very comfortable with your own outdoor patio. The neighborhood is very quiet and safe. We loved walking to downtown Naperville along the Riverwalk for meals, and even got to visit the impressive local pool in Centennial Park."

We were there on a Saturday night - the parking is free but the bar across the street was loud. Tina thoughtfully provides ear plays and a white noise machine to address the situation.
Tina was quickly responsive to my questions and gave us good advice about restaurants.
Five stars from me; highly recommended."

Stayed a few nights","Excellent communication from the host, everything was as-described and pictured. It felt safe and got the job done.
The apartment is definitely an eclectic space put together with a lot of love — local crafts on display (and for sale), a corkboard wall full of “thank you” notes and snapshots, a TV stand made from an old suitcase with an oar for a leg — the decor and age of the building are charming to many, but might ruffle the feathers of a strict minimalist.
It is centrally located and close to everything — as is the case with much of Sheboygan. Michigan Avenue is a little bit of a busy street, and the next-door neighbor is a hardware store, but it wasn’t too loud during our stay. The free ear plugs provided by the host were a nice touch.
Pro tip: Remember to bring some coins for the metered street parking on weekdays until 5 PM :) $0.50/hour."

It can get a bit hot but there are fans and a window AC unit so that helps. It was very clean and Tina does a great job checking in to see you've got everything and to advise on things to do in town. Overall, loved it and am planning on coming back next time!"

Stayed with kids","We had a pleasant stay. The host was friendly and proactive in her communications and the place was clean and had all the basics. The dining table only seats 2 and there is also no coffee table in the living room or outdoor table on the deck, so if more than 2 people will need to either take turns eating or not mind eating without a table. On the Sat. night we stayed there were loud teens or young adults in the streets until after 2AM, but otherwise a fairly nice location. The stairs up to the apartment may be tricky to navigate for anyone with mobility issues."

Stayed a few nights","Sheboygan is a sweet town and Tina's apartment is very comfortable and convenient to the downtown and about a 10 minute walk to Lake Michigan. Caveats--steep stairs for access, very loud on a Saturday night due to bars and street noise makes it pretty bad for sleeping if you want open windows, and one small AC can't cool the apartment--we had record heat. I imagine this would be perfect for cooler weather when the windows could be comfortably shut. Otherwise, great space and a decent kitchen setup."

Eclectically decorated to support local artists - a sweet touch and great way to pick up a local souvenir! Living room was cozy and comfortable for an evening TV show and the Sunday morning news. We didn’t get a chance to visit the neighborhood, but if local pubs are your style, you are in for a treat! Across the road from one of the highest rated craft beer bars in the area - we truly can’t wait to come back and explore more of this neighborhood and Sheboygan! Tina’s apartment is a great place to stay for exploring or for staying in and enjoying a cozy Wisconsin evening."

Stayed one night","Tina’s apartment is the kind of place I dream about living in... cozy and comfortable, unique and stylish, artistic flourishes throughout, walkable to waterfront, shops, restaurants. Tons of character, from both the building and its caretaker. The pictures truly don’t do it justice. Parking in front is metered on weekdays, but there was plentiful free neighborhood parking when we arrived late Friday afternoon.
We loved Paradigm for coffee and relaxation, Urbane for cocktails, Toy’s Thai and Laotian for exceptional pan-Asian cuisine (note: very, very leisurely!). Wonderful service at Rendezvous French restaurant right across the street. The Kohler Art Center is always packed with memorable exhibits. Short drive to Kohler-Andrae to walk the cord walk boardwalk along Lake Michigan.
We found the noise of being in an urban area in line with, well, the benefits of being in a urban area! I didn’t hear much after late dinner hours, but the ear plugs and white noise machine Tina thoughtfully provided were welcome in the event that we encountered a noisier evening.
We love Sheboygan, and hope to stay at Tina’s again!"

Stayed with kids","We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Laura's place. My daughter has a ten month old, And it was nice to have a place that wasn't full of a lot of trinkets or nicknames all over. As he is crawling and walking around things. It made it very easy for us to relax there with him. Another Bonus was being above a donut shop. Probably one of the best donut places. highly recommend. 10 out 10. Another nice gesture, Laura did for us Was have a box of Donuts for us. That was very sweet of her. If you're in the sheboygan area, Laura's place is a great stay. Thanks again for everything. We would definitely stay again."

Accommodating to every possible situation I inquired about and they even personalized my stay with a welcome board, a gift and a congratulations to my college graduate (which was the reason of my stay).

Lots of recommendations for local restaurants and places in the house. The kitchen has everything we need to make all the meals. A TV with lots of choices. The bathroom has plenty of towels. The house has lots of very cute decorations (many fishing related) that add some unique taste to the place. It's winter so we didn't need to use the backyard, but I saw there is a grill and chairs for a summer outdoor meal. The house is about 20 mins of walking distance to the lake (only 5 mins by car). We would definitely stay there again in the future."

The days were so long that I was really only there to sleep.
(But I hope to get back to the area in the future to explore the beaches and hiking!)
The house was exceptionally clean and was very scent neutral, which, as someone with multiple chemical sensitivities, I appreciate! I was also grateful that the linens were washed in unscented ""free and clear"" type detergent.
Despite the house being on an alleyway and close to other houses, I had absolutely no problem with noise whatsoever. And I am a very light sleeper and sensitive to noise.
For me, this airbnb checked all the important boxes: clean, quiet and a friendly and informative host.
Thank you!"

We had a wedding to attend and it was my wife and sons birthday weekend. I messaged Michelle the day of to let her know that we wouldn't be able to make it because our son was sick. When I canceled Airbnb offered to give me $70 dollars back for late cancelation. Since I didn't have much choice, I took what I could get. Shortly after I got a response that Michelle had returned all of the money I paid, $314 in total. I would have understood if she had kept it as the possibility of rerenting would be difficult. I am very gracious for that and will find a reason to rent from her in the future! There are still good people out there :)"

Positives: Impeccably clean, lots of towels and toiletries available, good location, fireplace in main bedroom is nice, comfortable bed, easy check-in. Michelle was very hospitable when we arrived!
Negatives: Small TV with some channels missing (e.g., we couldn't watch the Bucks game that was playing), slanted wood ceiling in the main bedroom/bathroom that you might bump your head on if you're not careful, very steep stairs to the top floor.

Stayed a few nights","This place is a gem. My family found it to be a peaceful and exceptionally clean home away from home while we were in town for a funeral. You’ll find a well-stocked full kitchen with table seating for six, comfy living room furniture, little extras in the bathroom like toothpaste and shampoo, good WiFi, reliable air conditioning, great water pressure in the shower, a mini book and games library, and blackout curtains for early summer sunrises, all in a cute city neighborhood. Visitors with more free time than we had will appreciate the area guide book and collection of restaurant menus as well. The icing on the cake was the outdoor fire pit and chairs. It really felt like home. We were three adults and I think the small home would be best for a maximum of four adults (although there is a daybed that would sleep a fifth). The main floor bed’s mattress is much firmer than the upstairs bed, so take that into consideration when picking a room. I would not hesitate to book this house again in the future."

Stayed with kids","We highly recommend a stay at ""Logan's Nest"" if your travels bring you this way. It was absolutely perfect for our Sheboygan Holiday. It really helped us to work out the logistics with other family in the Milwaukee and Green Bay areas. The place was just what we needed and well located for our beach and museum excursions. It was a perfect place to relax on the deck or around the fire pit after our running around. All in all, it was a great couple days and we loved our stay. A couple things to be aware of. There is only an accordion door to block the basement stairs and the child gate provided is rather flimsy. The other thing is the stairs going to the upper level are very narrow and should be approached with caution. Despite these couple of things, the place had everything we needed and we would certainly stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","This is our go to house to stay in when in Sheboygan. We like walking, and the neighborhood is lovely to walk around. We also walked to Three Sheeps, downtown, and the lake. Downtown is about a 20 minute walk, and a couple minute drive. Mikki has some lovely touches, like the plastic kids plates and cups, and both a drip and Kurig coffee maker. Three of us typically stay in the house, and we have plenty of room. We have family in the area who come over, and there is plenty of room for them as well. There was plenty of wood for the family to roast marshmallows in the fire pit. There was even wood stacked in the fire pit when we got there, another thoughtful touch. The house is always very clean. I’ve stayed in airbnb’s where the floor is sticky, or there’s cob webs in less used areas. This is certainly not the case at Logan’s Guest Nest. We start our visit with the little chalk board in the kitchen welcoming us by name, and end the visit wanting to stay.
Mikki is also very timely in replying to any messages.
We look forward to returning to Sheboygan and will continue stay at Logan’s Guest Nest."

It had sufficient cooking supplies to cook our own meals there and had really handy little touches such as fire starters for the fire pit out back and emergency rain ponchos for that rain that can catch us off guard. It had very good wifi signal ( which was a crucial point in our stay). If you stay in the upstairs bedroom you will want to be aware of the narrow stairs that go up there. That said, if you can traverse the stairs it's such a cute and comfy place to be. This home was one of the cleanest I've stayed at. I will definitely stay here again when traveling that direction."

The notebook full of ideas and suggestions was appreciated, especially the beach ideas. We did not use the fire pit but plenty wood was available. We did not have children along but as grandparents appreciated all the kids activities available. We did have a fun game of scrabble our first night! With the two bedrooms and living room day bed the three of us had our own spots to sleep. My sister was especially thrilled with the electric fireplace and separate half bath with the upstairs bedroom. We would highly recommend Logan’s Nest."

The kitchen has plenty of seating, so we were able to have my son and granddaughter over, who live in the area. Between the two bedrooms and the daybed, we each had our own sleeping space, which is nice when traveling. Allows each traveler to have their own space to unwind. The back deck is another great space to unwind. We didn’t have time for a fire in the fire pit, but we saw there was plenty of wood provided to do so. Was fun to see bean bag boards available too. And, my daughter enjoyed the little table and chairs, and made hamburgers and corn on the play grill. Our go to place when coming to Sheboygan!"

Such a wonderful thing when traveling. Michelle and Dennis attended to every detail. Nicely decorated and furnished. Snacks, coffee, and even a basket of toys that my granddaughter played with when she and my son stopped over during a walk around the lovely neighborhood. The house was a 5 minute walk from my son’s, and we were lucky enough to have great weather, so could do a lot of walking. The bathrooms had everything you needed, with nice water pressure in the shower. Black out curtains in the main level bedroom were nice. Everything was spotless from top to bottom.

Stayed with kids","We just loved Logan's Nest! Sheboygan is a fun community to explore. We checked out two delicious bakeries: City Bakery and Johnston's. Faye's Pizza was so good we ordered out from there twice in two days. 3 Sheeps was the reason we chose Sheboygan and did not disappoint. The Gameboard board game store was a delightful find with friendly and fun staff. Even though it was March and chilly we still enjoyed beach time at Harbor Center Marina. It was fun to see the surfers thoroughly enjoying the waves! And the Nest was a lovely home base and super clean. Like really clean. Not just saying that. We loved the upper bedroom - steep stairs but a cozy, warm, delightful space! The downstairs living room, bedroom, updated bathroom, and kitchen were perfect for our family of four. I appreciated the updated binder of area info that was provided. Mikki clearly pours love into each space. It was a windy March weekend so a backyard s'more roast in the portable fire pit didn't happen even though we came prepared. Next time!"

We were celebrating a birthday and she even bought a small gift to help with our celebration. The house decor added to the charm without being overdone. Every room was warm and welcoming with good use of color and furniture. We were only scheduled to be there for a weekend, but we could have stayed a month due to how comfortable we felt. The location was great for our hiking, wineries, art, and local flavor. Mikki was quick to respond to our request for a good fish fry but then gave us the space we needed.

We enjoyed eating dinner on the back deck, eating breakfast on the front porch, and making s’mores on the fire pit. She had plenty of fans to get good airflow (it can get a little stuffy upstairs as the lake breeze comes from the window away from the bed, but we chained some of her fans together, which kept it nice and cool during our stay). The location is close to beaches and the downtown (10 minutes or less). It was 20 minutes from Kohler-Andrae State Park (we visited there twice during our stay). We would definitely visit again!"

The beach, merely a step away, offered a unique charm against the lingering winter chill in late March, proving to be a serene escape. Beyond the immediate beauty and entertainment provided, we found the surrounding area to be rich with activities and sights, all within a convenient 10-15 minute journey.

She has provided a comfortable and beautifully curated home that allows for optimal relaxation, while the natural environment and lake do the rest! The stunning views make it difficult to want to leave the property, but Rebecca provided thoughtful recommendations of activities to enjoy throughout the surrounding area if you choose to. This oasis will be added to our list of favorites and we will absolutely be returning! All around, AMAZING!"

I always felt very comfortable knowing me, my family, and our friends were in great hands. Can’t say enough good things about the host. Really stood out from other hosts. Very readily available through text but definitely left us alone as well. It’s just what you hope for from a host. Gorgeous beach with spectacular sunrises."

When we could we enjoyed using the deck and fire pit. A very lovely place. Kitchen is a wonderful layout and they have all the essentials for meals. Rebecca is great at communication and I highly recommend a visit.

Stayed with kids","We had a little cold front move in right at the start of our stay and a little bit of rain as well. Despite the weather, we had an amazing time as a family. Everything was really clean and well thought out. The house was clearly designed to maximize the space while allowing us all(family of 5) to still feel close-by and connected. We spent 3 nights at the house and felt like it was the perfect amount of time to recharge and refuel. There are a number of eating options close by so we didn't have to waste space packing food and snacks for our kids. Our favorite parts of the trip were playing the many games available in the upstairs loft, while looking out the well placed window at the beach, and walking up towards the resort to the north along the beach. Ideal vacation for families that want to relax and enjoy one anothers' company. We will visit again. Thank you!"

It was nice to have yard space before hitting the sand for the kiddos to play safely. We utilized the firepit and the outdoor shower, more than once each. Thank you for having a packnplay, it was helpful to not tote ours. I really appreciated the PDF you sent of info prior to our stay, very helpful. It even included recommendations of local food. The view from the upstairs window, overlooking the lake was my favorite, especially at sunrise."

The day we were to exist the residence, a rainstorm came in. Although Rebecca could not accommodate us to stay another day she was very understanding and gracious. She let us keep our motorcycles in the driveway until we were to resolve how to get them back to IL. We recommend this location without any reservation."

The beach is steps away straight out the backyard and everyday was spent playing in the sand and water and building giant moats and castles. Beds were comfy, bathrooms nice, and the kitchen is great for cooking meals or enjoying board/card games at the kitchen table. Loved the record player and extensive record collection! Sheboygan was a fun area to explore with marina walks, Bookworm Gardens, the Aviation Center of Wisconsin, South Parlor Ice Cream, Freaktoyz, and the Music Boxx record store!

The most incredible thing about that place is access to the beach and literally enjoying Lake Michigan right in the backyard. I spent every morning watching beatiful sunrises.

Wake up and watch beautiful sunrises on Lake Michigan literally just walking on the backyard or through the amazing windows with spectacular views. We loved being able to see and hear the water from the house. We felt right at home and you have everything you need to enjoy yourself.
We loved how close we were to the beach, out kids couldn't get enough of the sand and the water.
Definitely take their reccomendations on local bratwurst, you will not regret it.
We just left and can't wait until we can head back. Rebecca's lake house is definitely a gem in Sheboygan."

The owners have been so thoughtful in making sure their guests have everything they need to make their stay will be fun, easy and comfortable. The outdoor shower is amazing and such a great idea for lake living.
Guests should know that the beach itself is not private and can be very busy especially on hot days. Lots of foot traffic, people with dogs off their leashes and unfortunately smokers leaving their cigarette butts on the sand. Most certainly not a reflection of the owners or their obvious love and respect for the water but none the less needs to be noted for future travelers."

There is an Alexa in the house as well which was an added benefit, providing our group with music throughout the day. The beach was sandy, the surf was mild, the water was warm for Lake Michigan. We were able to have a fire together at night to roast marshmallows as well which added to the memories made on our mini vacation. The beds were very comfortable and linen's were clean and soft. Minutes away is a cute ice cream shop on a board walk along the water. The beach house was the perfect space for our sister-in-law beach get away with kids!"

The house was perfectly clean, stylish, and comfortable. If the weather hadn't cooperated, there was plenty of fun inside with games, puzzles, books, and a turntable with an eclectic selection of albums. The back deck (with a private outdoor shower) offers great views, and the fire pit under a big maple tree gave us lots of yard time as well.

I appreciate all the extra little touches that Ellen left for us that made the stay even better. She anticipated what we would need as guest and are so appreciative of her skills as a host!!! Also, the home was beautiful!!! The decor was tasteful, classy, so well done and made you feel like you were at home not a stranger’s house. The beds were super comfortable and we slept so well and the fire pit made the stay one to remember!!
This was the perfect stay for a quick getaway with my friend after a very stressful week, and I appreciated its dog-friendly (even though I didn’t take my furbaby) it’s nice to know I’ve found I can bring her with for a wonderful vacation. Definitely planning on coming back!! Lovely home, great location and a wonderful host!!"

Stayed a few nights","We had tickets for the Pats/Packers game this past weekend and we were trying to find a good spot to stay for a couple days. Sheboygan isn’t necessarily close to Green Bay, but it made sense based on the ridiculous rates for stays up by the stadium. Ellen was great from the first time we touched base upon booking. She gave a great recommendation for using the Packers Discovery Bus charter the day of the game (great call!!), and she made sure the fire pit had plenty of wood available to use (which we were so excited about but didn’t end up making a fire!). Check in was easy, the area is quiet, and everything inside had a modern feel while respecting the original character of the home. Zero complaints whatsoever, we would highly recommend booking with Ellen if you are in town. Many thanks Ellen, and although we probably won’t be in Sheboygan again for a while (Pats play there once every 8 years), we would def book again. Thank you"

It's nice that the new Slo Food Market has a coffeeshop and delicious, and we also tried the John Michael Kohler Art Center Cafe for the first time, and liked that, too (always love the museum). The weather was weird, so we didn't bring bikes, but rentable scooters popped up on April 1st, and we had a great time riding those to 3 Sheeps Brewery (our favorite drinks were the version of The Wolf with coffee, chocolate, and vanilla, and the Strawberry Guava sour)"

It was the perfect location for walking and enjoying what the downtown had to offer, and the Elbow Room was very comfortable when we needed to come back and relax."

Stayed a few nights","Being our first time to Sheboygan, we didn’t know what to expect in the middle of Winter. What did we get? An amazing getaway weekend that we left feeling recharged and rested after a holiday weekend. The hosts were great and we are happy with our stay. The location is literally smack in the middle of everything you would want within reach - restaurants, groceries, coffee, and who would wanna miss out on FreakToyz! That place is a can’t miss! While it was 10 degrees on the first night, the warm coziness of the space melted that frozen thoughts away! For those looking to hike and explore, the Lighthouse and state parks are just a short drive away and the countryside is gorgeous! Harry’s Diner was a blast from the 50’s and their team are really welcoming! We are now thinking about coming back for Summer and try surfing Lake Michigan!"

I LOVED the alcove where the bed is - so so so cozy! And, this is the MOST COMFORTABLE BED I’ve ever had in an Airbnb or hotel. Being downtown was great, access to lots of restaurants. I would definitely stay again."

Stayed a few nights","I stayed in the ""Elbow"" at the Surf House for a 6 days. It was a great, walkable location for my daily trips to the Kohler Art Center. Jill was a very friendly and responsive host, the apartment was clean and comfortable. The only slight issue is that later in the night I could hear the bass line of the music being played at the bar next door, but I was able to block that out by turning the fan on when I went to bed. If, like me, you're a light sleeper, the fan is a good fix.
I'd definitely stay there again. It's a wonderful location, especially if you're on foot as I was."

Stayed a few nights","This is a second floor apartment on 8th street above the surf shop. Make sure to have some coffee and a keto donut at the Whisk bakery nearby.
This is an over 100 year old building with three apartments recently put on the second floor. The build out is relatively economical and there's a note on the refrigerator asking you to take out your trash and take the sheets off your bed when you leave.
I enjoyed the sleeping alcove and was able to get the apartment very dark which helped me sleep better. The wi-fi has a very bright light in it, so bring a piece of black tape to cover it up if you like to sleep in a dark room.
For a modest additional feel the host may be willing to let additional small children stay there and supply an air mattress and additional bedding, so ask for that if that is something you might want.
I would certainly stay here again or recommend it to family or friends."

The host reached out to us about the wifi being slow and gave us info on how to try a different account.
There were books to read, surfing picture type books and board games, and a wooden puzzle to keep you entertained after returning from a day of exploring.
The hosts have a folder with various restaurants and some activities you can do.
It is located right on 8th street which you can find a lot of things to do. Lots of fabulous restaurants, coffee places, and bars.
The SSH is located right next the Sly's, a very busy bar but we never were distributed by noise.
I would highly recommend SSH for your next visit to Sheboygan!!!!"

If you are hoping to sit back and watch a movie, the layout of the apartment and wifi connection made that difficult.

Stayed a few nights","Loved it! Perfect main street location for anyone hoping to bike or walk around town, especially by the lakefront. Great food and coffee available nearby at field to fork (easy to get menu items made vegan) and slo food market (if you want to cook yourself). Also shoutout to being close to z spot (great coffeeshop) and paradigm (great coffeeshop with vegan food and entertainment), which I didn't get to stop at this time, but loved when I lived in the area. Easy bike ride to a new favorite this trip--3 sheeps brewing's new location! Excellent craft beer. Easy walk to superior discount liquors, where I always stock up when I'm in town, because they have lower prices and some craft beers that aren't sold in Minnesota. Stopped at the new John Michael Kohler Arts Preserve on this trip, and highly recommend checking that out, along with the even closer original location, and several art pieces placed along the same street as this Airbnb (all free!). Overall, this Airbnb had the perfect location and a cute style, and I will probably rent this or one of their adjoining units if available next time I'm in town. We parked the car in the provided lot (which is also the greyhound station!) and didn't need to use it the whole trip."

Stayed a few nights","Quaint apartment close to downtown, restaurants, shops, and Lake Michigan. Great price! When we had a question the host responded immediately. She also gave us recommendations on a great place to eat. I would definitely stay again.
We forgot to return the parking pass, which was my fault, and unfortunately she had to charge me $75 replacement fee. I did not mind. It was an honest mistake. So if you stay at this property, don’t forget to turn in your parking pass, LOL!"

The apartment has everything you need, as well as a bunch of helpful information when you have tough choices to make about where to eat out (there are a lot of great places!). Although small, the hosts use the space incredibly well - it actually felt spacious. There is a noise warning - we heard a bit, but slept soundly both nights."

Stayed a few nights","The apartment did not meet our expectations. There were extra rules that needed to be followed that were not addressed prior to us booking. More transparency for future guests is ideal. Host was clear that place needed to be left ""as it was found"" upon departure and one could not wear shoes in the apartment, with this request, we expected a clean apartment. Spider webs behind the fridge, under the bed/couch and on the ceiling. Dusty areas around the apartment that were immediately addresed with host. Host was quick to respond and gave us the option of sending the cleaning crew to rectify this issue which we did not take. Host reimbursed 1/2 of the cleaning fee, but we honestly believe that when a cleaning fee is being charged and a special request to guests advises to leave the apartment ""clean"" so cleaning crew ""can focus on a deep cleaning"" after you depart and prepare place for the upcoming guests. One would expect the apartment to be ready for your stay. Host stated this was uncommon, but the dust and spider webs were a result of weeks if not months of not conducting a deep cleaning. Moreover, we encountered 2 incidences where a mid-size group of teenagers were hanging around in the alley smoking weed. Alley wich leads to the parking lot. This was also addressed with host who took immediate action and had teenagers removed from the alley. Furthermore, prior to booking, we were aware that there are a few bars/restaurants around and loud music will definetely be present, what we didn't expect was for the noise to be present until 5:30 a.m. One night, noise turned into an argument which resulted in a tv being thrown out of an apartment and landed in the alley. Moreover, sofa bed was extremely uncomfortable and hard. Additionally, wifi was super slow. Watching a movie on netflix was difficult due to poor internet signal. We didn't cancel because we were not going to get reimbursed due to the cancellation policy in place. In a more positive note, a variety of restaurants, stores and bars are within walking distance and lake is within driving distance. Overall, our personal experience was not a good one and are aware that there are things that cannot be controlled by the host, but we do hope that host takes into consideration our feedback to make an overall positive experience for future guests."

Bedroom and shower are small (as pictured). Dispenser for Aveda products in shower is another nice feature. The window AC unit worked great (for outdoor temps in the 70s when we were there) and they also provide a good-sized fan that we didn’t need.

We popped back in several times just to drop off leftovers or purchases. The kitchen was well laid out and stocked with basic utensils for when we didn’t want to eat out. Living and dining areas are small but very cozy and have everything you’d need. We are already planning our next trip to Sheboygan and SSH will be our first choice for accommodations!

Although the weather did not cooperate, the Elbow offered the perfect oasis for our time in town.
The space is decorated with a classy, trendy vibe and cleverly laid out. It may seem small in pics but feels very spacious and welcoming.
The location is absolutely perfect for any lake or river activities you may have planned. There are many restaurants and pubs within walking distance. The space also includes a parking pass so if you have a vehicle, it’s easily accessed for a drive up the lakefront or a quick jaunt into Milwaukee.
Very pleased with the space and hosts."

It had basically everything one could need, but we did restock the salt from the kitchen and the bathroom airfreshener as they were both out. There also was no extra toilet paper, just the one roll (we didn't need more then that, but a backup would have been nice just in case). The sleeping nook looks small when you are standing in front of it, but there was plenty of room when you were in there laying down, even my 6 foot tall husband agreed. We would definatly stay again, great central location!!"

Stayed a few nights",We loved our stay at the Sheboygan foodie flat. You can tell that the place is though fully put together. If we are ever in the area we will absolutely stay again. We loved checking out the local restaurants and the beaches. Kohler Andre State Park was beautiful. Definitely the best Airbnb I have stayed in.

Kim's place was clean, the decor was fresh and inviting and she even had snacks and fresh water upon check-in with a very sweet handwritten card. The area was quiet and not far from restaurants or the lake. I would definitely stay here again."

Stayed one night","The Sheoygan Foodie Flat was a fantastic find! We were able to slip away for a quick overnight before heading to Kohler Water Spa the next day and checking into this flat was the perfect start to a lovely Anniversary getaway.
It is clear that Kim and Jason take great pride in investing in a space that is inviting and decorated like a an HGTV magazine, not to mention EXTREMELY clean!!! It has literally everything, including stocked snacks and healthy breakfast options to enjoy a relaxing morning. Not to mention the wide variety of coffee to jump start the day!
Kim was so friendly and helpful, even leaving a personalized note wishing us a happy anniversary upon arrival. She was also available for Restaurant recommendations after we checked out!
I only wish we could have stayed longer to experience even more of what the Foodie Flat offered! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a place to relax and be close to all that Shebogan and Kohler offer!"

Stayed a few nights","A+ stay!
Kim and Jason were just the most welcoming hosts ever! Their place was super comfortable and welcoming. The place was pristine and so cutely decorated. We felt right at home and had everything needed!
The apartment was well stocked with everything you'd need. We also appreciated the snack welcome box with excellent chocolate, and stocked fridge with fresh fruit, butter, and milk. We bought some coffee for the drip machine but ended up using the Keurig pods provided because they were so convenient.
The beds were comfy and the shower was really nice. Having laundry in the unit was super convenient. We stayed during some of the hottest days in Sheboygan, over 90 degrees, and we were still very comfortable in the unit.
Kim and Jason were just the best. Super friendly and great communication. I really appreciated their local food recommendations (and second getting the mozzeralla al forno at Trattoria Stefano!)
My husband already stated how we have to go back and stay again!"

As happened in December, Jeremy had gone in to start the heat, and turn on a few lights, knowing I'd be arriving in the dark. And, he had double checked the Keurig was working, as I'd contacted him in December when I was having trouble with it - only because I hadn't put enough water into the reservoir! I highly recommend Jeremy and this place."

The condo was nice and clean and had everything you need. The beach bag was a nice touch and came in handy to carry all your things to the beach.
My only suggestion would be bring a white noise maker in case you have noisy neighbors upstairs. You can hear everything if they are loud."

So many touches like- leaving us snacks and notes of ideas of local things to do.
We rented kayaks nearby, heavenly.
We already plan to come back next summer!
The shower was to die!
Minor issues: the a/c is a window unit in one of the bedrooms. Ceiling fans in every room and screen doors every direction for cross breeze, early July we were fine.

The downtown is just a few minutes away by car. We enjoyed the meals we had there as well (Il Ritrovo and Field to Fork). We walked around the downtown after both meals, was very kind of our host to recommend that area. We also stopped in 3 sheep’s brewery which was a good time maybe a 10 or so minute drive past the downtown.

Stayed with kids","Our young family of 4 had a lovely week in this unit, which we used as a base for laid-back beach/playground/eating explorations around Sheboygan, as well as for easy access to the IndyCar race days at Road America. The unit is charmingly decorated, extremely well stocked, an easy walk/drive to everything in town, and very clean. Our host was communicative and clear before and during the stay, and the check-in binder was very helpful. The king size bed was super comfortable. We loved waking up to the views and sounds of the lake just steps away and watching happy park & beachgoers enjoy the area during the evenings. There were little touches to make sure our two young boys were included and comfortable, too. The heat/air-conditioning in the unit took a bit of figuring out - the week we were there went from unseasonably cool to record heat - and we had to experiment with the non-centralized units a bit, but it worked out. Thank you for a wonderful ""home"" for our first vacation in 3 years!"

Stayed a few nights","Great affordable place with a nice beach for your backyard. Listen to the waves as you lay in bed. Wake up to breathtaking sunrises over the lake. A nice usable kitchen made it easy to cook all our own meals. The park next door has nice grills for cooking out right on the lakeshore. The house is only 10 min from Kohler-Andre park with beautiful hikes. Easy parking, easy check in/check out. Lisa was very accommodating and super quick to respond, but also not at all intrusive. The house was very clean and we felt comfortable and safe, even during Covid. I would definitely stay here again."

The beds and pillows are very comfy and the linens were fantastic. The bathroom was well stocked with many extra towels and the kitchen was well equipped. I felt like I moved into my second home. They even had beach chairs and beach towels available for use. Very impressed. You can see the lake from every window and hear the waves if you open the windows. We would love to come back here in the future."

She was also available with a quick response if we had any questions. I already miss hearing the sounds of the lake from my bedroom at night. I would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed with kids","This is a beautiful place to stay! First, everything is so clean and well prepared. Kitchen and bathroom is fully stocked, there are games big TV that you can relax and enjoy with your family! Bed is so comfy and comforter is clean and warm-I checked the label so I can buy the same one XD
Enough extra blankets and pillows are in the closet.
They have a strong wifi, I had no problem working and streaming Netfilx there.
View is amazing. You can see lake right at the window, beautiful and peaceful scenery. Beach is in walking distance, like 2 minutes away, my daughter went there few times a day to play with sand. Soft, beautiful sand. Weather was little cold for play outside, I will book here again during the summer so we can spend more time at the beach.
It was perfect weekend getaway.
Jesse was the nicest host ever. She helped me so much, we had little trouble with our car and she went extra mile and beyond. She answered all the questions in second, recommended me a good auto repair places. I bothered her a lot because I don't have anybody but her and she was so friendly and nice.
One of the best Airbnb stay ever!"

Stayed a few nights","This place was exactly what we were looking for three of us on a mother-daughter get away. It suited us perfectly! The amenities exceeded our expectations. Everything we needed, we were able to find, making our stay very convenient and refreshing. In each room, it was evident that the hosts have VERY thoughtfully prepared their property to anticipate and accommodate the needs of the guests. Jesse was very responsive and so gracious to accommodate a few extra needs and special requests from us, which was above and beyond what she would have needed to do. The condo is very clearly well maintained and cared for. Even in the winter, while we weren't able to take full advantage of the beach and lake access, the views of the lake were still so breathtaking.
I'm so glad we chose this place - we have no regrets, and would book again in a heartbeat. It couldn't have been a more comfortable stay. The ONLY downer of our stay was that we had to leave! We would love to come back next time we're in the Sheboygan area.
I will note that while there are many perks of staying in a ground level unit, it does come the trade off of footsteps and muffled voices from above. For us it was not too distracting or bothersome, and it certainly wasn't constant - just something to be aware of for someone who may be more sensitive to that."

Stayed about a week","Waves of Happiness is a perfect name for this Airbnb! The unit it self was great...clean- newly renovated- loaded with everything you need for a home away from home! And decorated very ""beachy""...Also literally just minutes from many points of interest in Sheboygan. Communication was fast and excellent! The location was wonderful; very quiet street. LOVE LOVE LOVED being so close to the water. This was our first time to one of the Great Lakes and it felt, looked and sounded exactly like we were at the ocean! Great water views from both the front and back porches! Beach chairs were provided...the water was too cold (for us anyway) in October to swim. But we got our feet wet and took a nap on the beach several times. Enjoyed our coffee and the waves every morning on the back porch. The bedroom with the queen bed has a glass door that goes to the back porch...I discovered on our last day that it also has a ""roll away"" screen!!! Would not hesitate to stay at here again! Sheboygan is a very neat town with lots of history. THANK YOU Jesse and Brenda!!!"

The Airbnb itself was super clean and comfortable. Jesse and Brenda provided us with tons of suggestions and were easy to get ahold of. The bed was super comfortable and the fridge was stocked with local treats, including some dog biscuits from a nearby pet store!
We LOVED the proximity to the beaches and took advantage of that basically every day. They weren’t crowded and the hosts provided us with beach chairs and mats. We also sat on the porch every morning and enjoyed the lake sounds with coffee.
Coming from Chicago, we found Sheboygan to be quaint and quiet but a lovely way to reconnect with nature and each other.
We will absolutely be coming back!"

Stayed over a week","My first long term stay was at Stephanie’s place. I chose it for the location, ability to work remotely, and affordability. Stephanie put a lot of thought into making the place warm and welcoming for guests. In addition to normal amenities, there was a washer and dryer with detergent and dryer sheets, loads of kitchen supplies, plenty of storage space, and a private outdoor patio. The location was great with plenty of walkable restaurants and a couple grocery markets. I enjoyed Delano park many afternoons. It’s ~15 min walk, but I drove to maximize time walking with the lake view. It’s also an easy day drip to Door County or Milwaukee. This is next to the fire station, so I heard sirens maybe once a day which isn’t bad especially being in a city. The steps coming up to the apartment were a bit shallow/steep which made it a little harder when carrying things, but they are indoors and there’s a handrail. The parking lot was convenient. Stephanie was very responsive. Would recommend!"

The clever combination of the old and the new really resonated with me! The bed was super-comfy, I LOVED having a separate office, and -- even though the weather wasn't particularly cooperative, the balcony was an extra added attraction. Having Stephanie downstairs at the MiniMocha Play Cafe was another plus: I could just walk in the door (take your shoes off!!) to talk with her about any questions, concerns or compliments (lots of those!!)"

Gorgeous vintage details like high ceilings, wood floors, arched doorways. Love the potbelly stove in the living room. TV in both the bedroom and living room. The outdoor area with table and chairs is a nice touch. The kitchen has a full sized refrigerator, rangetop, microwave, toaster, toaster oven and kitchen conveniences.

Stayed a few nights","reviews are pretty straight forward ""did you get what you paid for"" OR a simple fill in the blanks of Y/N.
this is really BOTH. getting what you paid for. Absolutely YES. knowing all about the History of a Wonderful town of Sheboygan NO. Not until you step inside this amazing place with wonderful FACT and artifacts of the History of this wonderful Building so tastefully set to the TIME when things were, the way they were!!! you can feel the vibe right when you press unlock on the keypad, the decor was set Back in time with an amazing rustic feel for what really was. Great Job on feeling the Home with the times. beautiful place, neat setting and awesome walkabout places to go and see and rest the feet in a nice place to eat. Truely an amazing overnight stay for 2. Thank You"

Stayed a few nights","Stephanie is extremely sweet and helpful. This is by far the nicest AirBnB I've ever stayed in, not for the size but for the thoughtfulness Stephanie put into the space. There was heated floors in the bathroom, the bed was AMAZING, super soft and adjustable and it has a massage feature. Loved the shower and it made me rethink my upcoming bathroom reno. The apt is centrally located in Sheboygan so it's 2 blocks from all the best restaurants in town. The space is great for a couple and maybe 1 small child. If I come back to Sheboygan I would definitely stay here."

Stayed a few nights","We booked our stay to do an Executive Retreat & celebrate the end of 2022 for our small business. This space has absolutely everything you need to relax away from home and work if you need to: comfy bed, extremely clean space, well stocked kitchen (there’s even a Keurig!), good wifi, a mini Bluetooth speaker, a printer, they really thought of everything!
We also love that it’s within walking distance to the lake, Stefano’s, and the new SloFood market which has a great upscale selection of wine, cheese, meats, chocolates and lots of easy to take home food.
I hope to return in the summer when it’s swimming weather. Sheboygan beaches are beautiful.
Last, I also loved the interior design of the space. I wouldn’t mind living in a home decorated like this. The heated floor in the bathroom is my new obsession for my future home."

Both ends of the unit have a lot of natural light. The rooftop patio is a really cool feature that sets this apart from similar rentals. Most importantly, Stephanie has clearly put a lot of thought and effort into making it a positive experience for visitors. Nicely equipped, maintained and clean. I'd absolutely stay here again and am even more likely to visit the area knowing this unit is available."

The bedding, blankets, towels are all first rate. The bathroom is so beautifully Art Deco designed, I have asked her to share with us the materials she used as we are in the process of building and I want my guest baths to look like hers! The shower is a spa experience, the outdoor patio and deck the ultimate space to unwind, and you’ll find bits of history and nostalgia every time you turn around.

You can tell the host had spent a lot of time and care in designing and furnishing the apartment. She was also quick to respond and accommodating. The location is on a quiet street and just down the block from the main drag of shops, restaurants and pubs. The apartment is up a flight of stairs, but didn't have a problem with that, even after a long day of sightseeing and walking. We hope to stay at this Airbnb each time that we visit Sheboygan."
