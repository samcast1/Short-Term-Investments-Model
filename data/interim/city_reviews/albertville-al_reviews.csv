Stayed with a pet","Such a cute cottage! Came in town for a baseball tournament & needed a place that was dog friendly. This place was cozy, super clean and a 3 minute drive to the ballpark. It has the charm of an older home with lots of space and modern amenities. Also walking distance to some great food on Main St. The host was so friendly and responsive. We’d love to stay here if ever in town again. Thanks!"

Stayed a few nights",There were so many things I LOVED about this place. The outdoor shower being my favorite. The next best thing...hearing the birds chirp and the creek rushing by as you wake up in the morning. This was by far one of my favorite stays through Airbnb (I use Airbnb for most of my vacations ) The location was good. I mean you are in the woods so don't expect to right downtown. We went to a neighboring county and had dinner on the lake. Not a bad drive. I would highly recommend this place for a long weekend.

I highly recommend making the small hike down arrowhead trail. It’s a fairly easy hike and the scenery is so worth it. Everything about my experience was 10 out of 10. We can’t wait to come back for a longer stay."

Stayed one night","This was my second visit to Coyote Cabin and I’m already looking forward to returning again! It has everything I look for in a serene escape: privacy, comfortable accommodations, a welcoming host, and endless nature views. Highlights of my stays always include watching the sunrise from bed, enjoying a hot cup of coffee while taking in the nature sights and sounds from the private outdoor shower, and star gazing in the spacious hot tub. We love making a fire in the designated fire pit area by the cabin (also private) and wandering the “Arrowhead Trail” on the property. The cozy outdoor furniture provides a peaceful space to bird watch, do yoga, journal, and make memories with your loved one. We have never have any trouble navigating the short walk to and from the parking area, just a few steps away from the cabin door. Cannot wait for my next relaxing weekend at Coyote!"

We were supposed to go for my birthday this past spring, but we unfortunately had to cancel last minute. I’m SO glad we had the opportunity reschedule this weekend! It was just what we needed. We live 600 miles from each other and this was a perfect way to spend some time together. The cabin is adorable! So remote and quiet with lots of places to hike in the area. We felt right at home, and Christy was an excellent host! We had no trouble checking in and knew what to expect getting on and off the property. We LOVED our stay and will hopefully be back sometime soon! 😊"

Stayed one night","My husband & I stayed at the Hawk’s Nest for our anniversary. It was a unique experience & very peaceful. The view from the balcony overlooking the creek was beautiful & the hot tub was relaxing. We took advantage of the fire pit & charcoal grill as well. The bathroom situation didn’t bother us at all & is easy to use if you read the instructions. If you’re looking for a relaxing getaway surrounded by nature, the Hawk’s Nest is the spot! If you don’t like nature, can’t walk up/down gravel slopes, don’t like outdoor bathrooms or being in the middle of nowhere, this place probably isn’t for you. There is no TV or wifi but the cell phone signal picked up just fine (AT&T & T-Mobile). The arrowhead trail down to the creek was grown up so we didn’t attempt hiking down there but more adventurous couples may enjoy it. The host Christy was accommodating & sweet! Only con: it’s a little pricey for budget travelers."

We woke up early that morning to catch the sunrise it was breathtaking. This is a trip we will definitely be taking again in the future.

We enjoyed the hot tub at night while they danced all around. Outside showers are completely freeing. No one can see you either. The tree house faces sunrise as well so we got to wake up with the sun. After hiking all day, it was the perfect place to relax. 10/10 would recommend to a friend. Beyond stoked to visit again in the cold season."

Stayed a few nights","Nice view but horrible communication from the host and very unprofessional experience that just keeps getting worse since we left….cried the whole way home from embarrassment because of these accusations. Hawks nest was nice until we realized the door malfunctioned and locked us outside with all our belongings in the treehouse and host was not answering any calls or texts so we ended up having to walk up the hill to her residence to get any help with getting the door open. Then hosts husband comes down and inspected the door lock and says it malfunctioned and needed to be reset he continued to mess with it for about ten minutes before providing a Lowe’s card for us and told us how to “break in” and out of the tree house.. we had to sleep in a strange place to us with the door cracked open all night so we wouldn’t get locked inside which ended up happening anyway because getting up in middle of the night I found we had been. my husband had closed the door and it locked me INSIDE the tree house. at this point I’m panicking rather then relaxing. then the table was poorly built with small nails and came loose when I set two drinks on it right before we ate breakfast. We assumed the host already knew it was loose with the lack of proper nails and thought nothing more of it so we put it back in place and sat down to eat. then the morning we’re leaving I woke up to unexpected spotting from my menstrual cycle and I tried to do the best I could with the situation, embarrassed we left the place as clean as we possibly could with given supplies. Then an hour after check out the host requests 300$ for damages and cleanings. I agreed to pay the $150 for the bedding when I privately messaged the host… then to add to the embarrassment I see she blasts us on her business page as if I wasn’t already embarrassed enough… nothing like opening Facebook and first thing to pop up is pictures of your spotting for the public to go and comment of how nasty and gross of a female you are because you have an unexpected period….. this weekend has me traumatized to ever stay in an Airbnb again.
and now we are up to $520 because I didn’t agree with her claim. After I agreed to pay for all bedding expenses.
SO if you want a quite place this is nice but enter expecting to be blamed if anything happens and you won’t be able to get a fast response from your host if something goes wrong. ..if you’re a postpartum woman like myself with irregular cycles make sure to bring your own bedding because there’s no way to clean bedding at the tree house and host will blast you on their Facebook business page (pictures and all) for being a gross female because something natural happed to you."

Funny thing, i booked late night/on a whim & did not read the description, but the primitive-ness was awesome & fun. I was heading for a first visit in Guntersville which was awesome, but this was the first Airbnb option that popped up, fell in love immediately, Very Happy to have booked the visit. Hot tub was nice, place was very clean, everything was Perfect for my 1day stay. Christy was available, very responsive & incredibly kind. She has a 2nd Treehouse available next door, fyi.

Stayed a few nights","My husband & I spent our third anniversary at the Hawk’s Nest and we enjoyed every minute. The space is comfortable (especially the bed) and intimate. We felt as if we were miles and miles away from everyone. Christy thought of everything for the Hawk’s Nest so be sure you only bring the bare necessities. Need body soap, shampoo, conditioner? She has it all ready for you. We loved the outdoor shower and unless someone is coming up the creek, no one will see you. The space is perfect for an intimate stay with your significant other.
For outside entertainment, we went into Gunthersville and fell in love with the town so be sure to check it out. City Harbor in Gunthersville is beautiful. The Gunthersville State Park is worth drive through as well.
All and all, we loved every single thing about the space. My husband and I will be back in the near future. Thank you for hosting us for our anniversary weekend."

There is electricity and heat/ac inside. The toilet seat is chilly if it’s cold out. The tap (well?) water was delicious. Exactly the kind of chill, restorative place we wanted. The guest before us had left a strong perfume smell behind— the host asks you not to use those in the house rules so please, don’t!"

You can expect spectacular views of the creek, looked like a river to us today, but it’s been raining a lot and so the water was rushing, but it sounded wonderful! The outdoor shower gets nice and hot, so even if it was 20 degrees outside, you would be toasty! The bathroom was cleaner than most hotel bathrooms, it smelled fantastic in there. Disinfectant and patchouli spray! The light for the shower is inside the bathroom as well as a plug-in night light if you are half asleep and don’t like turning bright lights on. The hot tub!!! Worked great and the jets were amazing! You can expect nothing short of perfect from Christy! She aims to please, and that she did! We will be back! Thank you again! Happy New year!"

It’s a truly magnificent house. We were wishing we could stay longer. We’d come back for a week just to relax even if we had no other plans in the area, it was so wonderful. More than five stars, all the stars! A+++++ I hope we can come back again another time for a longer stay."

The master suite was comfortable and we slept so well that we didn’t want to leave. We ate dinner close by at two of the suggestions Cam made and both were excellent. Looking forward to visiting again in the future.

From the meticulous and thoughtful furnishings to the awe-inspiring scenery, Birdseye View provides a sanctuary both within the beautiful home and while enjoying the view from the deck. The host goes above and beyond for his guests which is few and far between these days and very much appreciated. Our stay and overall experience was excellent."

The word sublime comes to mind and I don’t recall the last time I’ve described anything as such. I hope to return at least bi-annually. The host, Chris, is the absolute best which heightens the experience. I want to give the BIRDSEYE View 10 stars but the app only allows 5. So, here you go ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️. ~Evette"

Stayed with kids","The overall home was great on the inside. We had issues with the water and it's pressure, neither of the bathroom showers water had heat. The master bath is where we all had to take baths because the other bathroom wouldn't heat all the way. The arrival kind of through us off, because the grass looks as if it hadn't been cut in a few weeks, not to mention it looks as if construction was taking place, old doors where left under the carport.
The inside of the home had been maintained and kept very well, the fact that their wasn't any curtains through the dinning room, living room, and glass patio door area was quite disturbing, especially with me having three daughters and a wife with me.
I tried to contact the owner (Destiny) a few days before about adding an extra day and never heard anything back, that was before we arrived of course. Master shower door had a crack, master bed post under mattress was bent and so was guest bed."

House was clean and free of clutter except for a fireplace insert sitting to the side--looks like it was waiting for an installation to be done in the future :-). The only fault we found was a light switch cover missing in the dining room that left the wiring exposed, but again we expect that was part of some future renovations to be completed. We will definitely be booking again for upcoming baseball tournaments this summer."

Cons: The toilet seat in one of the bathrooms is loose and moves. I’m not sure if the heat in the house works. It was pretty chilly and we ended up using space heaters to warm up. The stopper in one of the bathtubs doesn’t work which was a bummer because we have little kids that needed baths.
Overall we enjoyed our stay and would stay again if we were in the area."

We had six adults but only two double beds. And two twin beds. One only had privacy. The beds are small. Many light bulbs were out so no bed side lamps for reading. Shower downstairs drain is slow to drain out. So might need cleaning. House is super cute and in a great location. I suggest barn doors on addition downstairs and another big bed to help hold more people. House smelled very clean and it was nice to have use of carport

Stayed about a week","Nice and cozy home. Clean and comfortable. 99% as described.
We did have an issue streaming shows on the TV's in the living room and upstairs bedroom. They had problems connecting to the wifi and staying connected. The TV in the downstairs bedroom worked. No antenna for local channels.
There are some cosmetic issues on the interior such as missing grout near the bottom in the shower and popping and peeling paint on a few of the walls. As a handyman I see the paint issues quite often in older homes with plaster walls.
I also noticed the lack of smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. There is an empty mounting ring on the kitchen ceiling that peaked my interest. After searching through the house, I found the detector on the second floor was newer but had a dead battery and the detector on the first floor was a year from expiring and contained no batteries. This is definately a code violation for any short term rental. Something the homeowner should be mindful of."

Group trip","The Turret house was super cute! The neighborhood was friendly and very walkable. There isn’t much “to do” in the town but we had received some recommendations from the neighbors on restaurants to go that were only 10-15 min away in Albertville or Gadsden.
The layout of this house is so unique but worked perfectly for me and my friends. Would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","I stayed here for an extra long weekend-Wednesday thru Sunday- for a baseball tournament with my two teenage kids. We had a fun time in the house and the surrounding area. Very quaint. This neighborhood was quiet, peaceful, beautifully landscaped, and felt super safe. We had trouble getting in at first but Shane was super responsive and got us in quickly.
I feel like the backyard didn’t get much show in the profile as I was so surprised to find such a gem of a patio/deck. Decorated with lights and native plants. My son stayed upstairs in the loft bedroom and loved the air hockey game (we couldn’t get it to turn on but you could still play it) and tv. My daughter nested in the double bedroom and absolutely adored that carriage day bed. We were all cozy in the beds/linens. The only thing I would recommend is if you are staying more than 2 days bring more of your “essentials”-TP, shampoo, body wash. But this was not an issue. I can’t say enough good things about this place. We loved it!!"

Stayed about a week","What a beautiful home. As soon as I walked in, it felt right. I was absolutely
beeming with excitement to explore it. Couldn't get the smile of my face as I was walking through the entire home. Every door I opened was a source of aww. It was absolutely beautiful and kind of whimsical. The house was a great source of peace, so bright and airy. I was able to meditate and do my yoga in complete Zen state. We had everything we needed in this home and some extras that we didn't expect. I chose the room with the bonus space that leads out into the back deck. It was exactly what I needed. I didn't know the effect my trip to Boaz was going to have on me. I came back home with a sense of peace and tranquility. Your home played a big part in it. Thank you for sharing your beautiful home with us. I WILL be staying here again. The only place I want to stay in Boaz"

The decor is modern southern chic with beautiful unique pieces. Very comfortable beds with soft bedding. Clean and smells nice. This home is so huge I got lost a few times. The backyard gas fireplace was a very nice touch. We miscalculated our travel plans and realized we needed to stay an extra night in Alabama and Shane was more than friendly and accommodating accepting us another day. This is the most comfortable I have ever been in a strange place. We will come back here the next time we visit family in Alabama.

The teenager enjoyed having a little private space upstairs. We would definitely stay again! Shane was a very responsive host.

Stayed with kids","Matt's rental was a nice change of pace from the hotels we're used to staying in when traveling for baseball tournaments! The location was not far from Sand Mountain Park where my son's team was playing for the weekend. We were actually closer to the park than most of his teammates, who stayed at a hotel!
The rental is the basement of a house and it was very comfortable and cozy! Everything looked exactly as depicted in the pictures online, so no surprises. The space was clean (spotless), particularly the kitchen and bathroom, and the overall space, though small, was very comfortable and perfect for a travel ball player and his dad! I would recommend this rental for anyone coming to Albertville who is looking for a nice, comfy, cozy, and affordable rental instead of an over-priced hotel room!"

Stayed with kids",For us the traffic noise was terrible. Even at 2 am it sounded like drag racing was taking place. The house smelled musty and there was a lot of spider webs as we walked through the house. This is the first rental in a lot of years that didn’t have a stocked kitchen with appliances and amenities. Having to come through the garage to enter each time was frustrating because the garage door is super loud and even the neighbors have an opinion regarding the noise. Luckily we weren’t at the house for long periods mostly just to sleep. It served the purpose for what we needed.

Older home with some updates - but very functional for our needs. Home was clean, large TVs in all the bedrooms. A couple of squeaky drawers & such - but it’s an older home. Only suggestion I would have is to upgrade the sheets which are pretty worn. We would stay here again for sure."

Not just convenient, Brenda’s home was also comfortable and had everything we needed for our stay. We took advantage of the nice clean linens and the kitchen where we cooked a few meals. We really appreciated all of the special details that made our stay more enjoyable. Next time we are in Albertville for a tournament if available we will absolutely choose to stay at Brenda’s place again. Thank you Brenda!"

Stayed a few nights","Such a great stay and beautiful property! Definitely make sure to read fully the description, it is very clear and explains EVERYTHING that you need to know about the place. The view was beautiful and hearing the creek in the background was peaceful. The grill/fire pit area was such a relaxing area to hangout. Christy was very responsive and even recommended places to go, we brought our four wheeler and visited Buck’s Pocket State Park that had some ORV riding trails and only 30 minutes away! Highly recommend this was a great way to start the New Year!"

Stayed one night","Instrustions were very easy to follow getting in. Bed was comfortable and everything was very clean. Definitely a place to stay during a warmer season. There a nice table and chairs outside but it was far too cold and windy to sit outside and enjoy a meal. Inside had stools but no table. We didnt get to enjoy the trails because it was too dark by the time we got there and i felt it was way too steep and did not want any injures. The next day was rainy and needed to check out before we were able to explore. The hot tub did not feel hot enough, started at 102 but wouldnt go over 97 after being in for maybe 15-20 min. It would have been nice to have stairs to the deck on the hot tub side as it was sooo cold having to walk around the house to get back in. On a nice warm day this would have been great! It is a small space, quiet and peaceful. Very pleased with the quick response from the host. We will definitely keep this place in mind next time we travel during the warmer season!"

Stayed a few nights","We had the best time at Coyotes Cabin! We will definitely be back. I’m hoping to make it an annual trip, if not sooner! The cabin feels like you’re secluded but just minutes away from a wide variety of restaurants. This trip was exactly what we were looking for, if not better. I loved the loft in the mornings for a beautiful view with coffee and a book. The hot tub was so nice, we have considered getting an inflatable one for our home and are officially sold on it after trying out Christys! Christy was a fabulous host, very responsive and helpful. We felt right at home. We will absolutely try out the other cabin next time if this one isn’t available. 10/10 stay and host!"

Only complaint with the whole place was that whatever was used to clean it smelled extremely strong to us and it was requested that we not leave the windows open since there were no screens and they want to avoid bugs. Understandable."

We utilized the grill and had a romantic steak dinner on the porch and then went for a soak in the hot tub! Our honeymoon was our second stay at Coyote Cabin and we will definitely be coming back for another romantic getaway! Thank you for all your hard work in making the perfect little cabin Christy!

Stayed a few nights","What an amazing gem of a property! Christy has done an excellent job communicating and describing this property online. It’s exactly what she says but SO, SO much better! You cannot describe how peaceful and relaxed this property is. We enjoyed the bed downstairs over the loft area but the loft area is cute! We loved the hike down to the private creek. Absolutely worth the hike down and back! Beautiful cool water in the creek. We just sat and talked on the rocks enjoying the scenery! One of our favorites amenities was the private outdoor shower. So relaxing and wonderful to have the comforts of a warm shower but outside to enjoy the nature. I think I could have sat on the deck all day but we hiked into Noccalula Falls, which was breathtakingly gorgeous! Rocky but pretty easy hike to the bottom. The swimming hole there was super fun …can’t wait to take the kids! Lots of things to do see within a 30 mins drive (or less) and lots of good food also!
I cannot recommend this place enough!!"

Stayed a few nights","We had a great time at Christys cabin. If you’re planning activities that’ll require a table top, know there isn’t a coffee table - we made the upstairs loft work for reading and puzzles. We ate breakfast and dinner out on the patio. Pack a pair of outside shoes to wear to the outside shower and hot tub, if you don’t your feet will be dirty by the time you get back inside. The stay was wonderful and everything we hoped for, for our kid free getaway. Christys local recommendations came in handy. A lot of places are closed on Sunday and Monday’s but there’s still plenty open. We checked out Co-Op Brewery & harbor view winery over by City Harbor. In downtown Albertville we are at Local Joes and we also tried Julia’s like Christy recommended."

If u like hiking and the out doors this is it. We are seniors and we made it down to the creek very carefully but we made it and it was perfect. The town is about 10 away and looks of shopping and eatery. I want a week on my next trip.

Stayed one night","This cabin was beautiful! It sits on the bluff which feels like a treehouse from inside. Christy communicated well with us from start to finish. The cabin is laid out nice for a small space and decorated well. Parking was easy and convenient. We also loved the deck with the stunning view! I would strongly suggest reading the fine print extensively and more than once though. My only complaint is that there are zero coverings for the wall of windows facing the deck nor the window over the kitchen sink (this is listed in the listing details but we missed it). We felt a little open and exposed knowing that there were other cabins close by. I could see the cabin next door and their car through the kitchen window so I assumed they could potentially see me. Since it’s all one big open space, we felt like it wasn’t private except in the bathroom where we could shut a door. The sun also rises directly through the wall of windows. It is a gorgeous sun rise through the trees, but we wanted to sleep in and were up at 5:15am due to no way to block the sun at all. Our desire was to stay our night in a place where we could rest and refresh with some extra sleep after a day of driving which unfortunately wasn’t the turnout. I am sad that we won’t be staying here again for this reason. For the price of this cabin, I feel that an option to cover the windows should absolutely be included, no matter how gorgeous the sunrise is."

The inside of the cabin is beautiful, the deck is lovely, and we enjoyed the hot tub as well. We highly recommend. Christy was also a great host in communicating with check in and everything."

Stayed one night","Coyote’s Cabin was the perfect getaway. We were out of town for a wedding at Lake Guntersville and needed a place to stay and decided to stay at Coyote’s Cabin. I’m so glad we did because we enjoyed every second of it.
The inflatable hot tub was great. I did not think an inflatable hot tub would be as good as a regular hot tub but it was!
The cabin is located in a nice neighborhood and not to far from restaurants and stores.
You can see Christy’s house and the other cabin but we still felt like we had plenty of privacy.
The cabin was very clean and decorated so cute.
I thought we would have to hike to get to the cabin but it wasn’t a far walk at all.
Would love to go back and spend more time there. 100% recommend booking it."

It's quiet and peaceful, but from the deck you can hear the sounds of the creek below. The creek is definitely worth the trek down, just wear appropriate shoes. The only problem we had was nothing to do with the host or the cabin itself, we didn't have cell phone service to call her to check in, but she was extremely helpful and got the code to us. It was very nice to be disconnected and just spend time together in a cozy place. Albertville has everything you would need and is nearby. Lake Guntersville is stunning. Our only regret is that we were only there for two nights."

Stayed a few nights","Randomly picked this place coming from Ohio and we glad we did. The place is very clean, no gritty feeling on the floor. The bed is comfortable enough for two people. I'm 6ft tall and it was fine for me. The trek down to the water isn't bad, it's slippery when wet. (we didn't slip at all with sandals and it rained a bit during our stay) The tub was a nice addition, my wife had bubbles going and she loved it. The view was fantastic. Eating outside in the morning with the sun rising before going to scenic destinations my wife planned was great. I didn't expect the area to be as nice as it was. So many things to see all around. Felt it was better than the Smokey Mountains. The caverns nearby seemed better than the Mammoth Caves. not a bunch of people crowded the places. Our 10am appointment in the cathedral caverns, we were the only ones there. The big waterfalls nearby, only ones there. The caves nearby, let a couple rappel down, then had the whole cave to ourselves. Didn't expect any of this really. Such an awesome area with wonderful a wonderful host. Thank you so much"

Stayed one night","Great little place for a pit stop!
We stayed one night and were kinda bummed that the tub outside was for esthetics purpose mainly, it doesn’t have running water and is apparently used for hot Summer day with a water hose! It’s a very small house, tiny bathroom and shower. Be sure to not put the ceiling fan on high because it will make a racket while you sleep and you’ll think it’s something trying to crawl in the house with you! lol
It could have been a little cooler in the house but the air conditioning is a split system that is set at 72 and if you want it turned down the owner has to do it for you. Also, the bed is a full. Very small for me and my 6 foot tall hubby!
Owner of property was prompt in response to questions and check in was a breeze!
The creek was the best part about it, but be warned it’s a treck there and back. Straight down hill getting to it and then straight up hill coming back!
Overall, glad we stayed at house but probably won’t be revisiting."

Stayed a few nights","Christy's cabin is wonderful! It's very private, nestled in the woods with a beautiful deck that overlooks a green valley with a lovely creek at the bottom. The firepit is so comfortable and relaxing. Definitely build yourself a fire and settle in for an evening. The outdoor clawfoot tub was so much fun: we filled it up with bubbles and drank mint juleps in the bath under the trees. So. Much. Fun. The walk down to the beach is steep, but worth it. If you walk upstream a little from the beach there is a big flat rock on the creek that is perfect for laying out and listening to the water while you relax under the trees. The bed is comfy, the view is beautiful.
And, Christy is as gem. We had a problem with one of our vehicles, and she arranged to get us help right to the cabin so that it didn't disturb our weekend at all.
We loved the place. Perfect romantic getaway for a couple!"

The cabin is very clean and Christy provides amenities to make it feel like home. Having no stove wasn’t an issue. The hike up and down to the creek can be a little tricky. Definitely bring tennis shoes or a croc-type shoe if you plan on going down. We ate at Local Joe’s, Fire by the River, grabbed coffee in downtown Albertville (can’t remember the name)... every local we encountered was super friendly! Christy is an amazing host and communication with her is always easy and fast. We have fallen in love with the cabin and already want to come back!

The neighborhood was lovely and quiet. We highly recommend both the home and hosts!!"

Stayed a few nights","This was my second time at Mike’s home, and my wife and I are already considering staying there again to assist with our move to Alabama.
Mike is the kind of host you hope for every time you rent an airbnb. Friendly, responsive, trustworthy. An all around great guy.
Returning to Mike’s home felt so comfortable, and familiar, it felt like returning home almost.
The place is great. It is a pretty big size. The backyard is fantastic for letting your dogs get some exercise or for sitting around in the sun, or just enjoying being outside. Showers work great, beds are comfortable. Tv works great, and the house has everything you could need.
I enjoy Albertville very much, but Mike’s neighborhood is so perfect, as it is away from it all, yet still close to everything.
I highly recommend staying here. It is also a close drive to so many different areas. Huntsville, Guntersville, many state parks, hunting, fishing, hiking, etc."

Stayed with a pet","Brown's Creek Cottage is delightful! Peaceful, comfortable and lovely. The hosts, Larry and Monica, tailored a welcome note to us and messaged us after the check-in time to make sure we were in and settled. The bed was comfortable, the back porch is of real benefit when traveling with a pet. We spent a bit of time each evening on the porch watching our pup Bella take her last outdoor stroll before bed. Each morning, we took her to Civitan Park a couple of blocks away right on the lake, which is gorgeous and peaceful in the mornings. I loved that each bathroom came equipped with body wash, shampoo and conditioner, thoughtfully selected, easily dispensed. It is obvious that these hosts understand that the ""difference"" makes all the difference. Little things are important - from well appointed bathrooms, to having a pot/pan of every size. Browns Creek Cottage is one of the best Airbnb experiences we have ever had and we highly recommend it.

Walking into the house, it was wonderfully clean and everything was organized and ready for my stay. I was there for a longer time, and mid-stay he proactively checked in to make sure I had everything I needed. This was a fishing trip for me, and the place is great for that purpose: close to the boat landing (maybe 3 minutes), and you can pull your rig into the driveway from the alley - no backing up. As an added bonus, it's a quick walk from the house down to the waterfront walking trail, which is a nice feature of this area of Guntersville."

Huge backyard, fenced and great for our little dog to roam and explore. We had everything we need and our host had even left little milkbones treat for our little dog. Nice screened in back porch. Perfect location and its in a peaceful neighborhood. We are definitely coming back. ""Thank You"" to our host and his wife for letting us stay at your cottage."

Stayed with a pet","Came for a weekend girls trip with my daughters and their brother, “Mr Chunks”. The home was lovely and was nicer than we were even expecting. Mr Chunks is an older dog, and the steps out the front door were easy for him to manage. In his younger years, the large fenced in back yard would have been fabulous! The mattresses were very comfortable, and I appreciated the power strip available for easily charging my phone. I enjoyed the fact that I didn’t have to back out of the driveway, but could just pull forward out the alley.
I loved that everything we wanted to do was a short(and beautiful) drive away. We spent most of our time going out to eat, exploring the state park and just sitting and enjoying the lake views…and laughing…lots of laughing.
We plan to come back and bring a few other family members next time. Maybe we’ll even have time to put some puzzles together next time(that were at the house). We kept saying we were going to, but never did.
It was a perfect little get away. Can’t wait to come back."

So close to the Piggly Wiggly, parks, dog park, walking trails, softball fields, basketball/tennis courts.. all those located at the water scenery! Everyone we ran into in town was so nice ! Larry was so nice and helpful! Thank you so much for letting us stay and we can’t wait to come back!!!"

Easy parking with electric for the truck and trailer in a quiet neighborhood. The location is only a couple blocks from the boat ramp and within a few minutes of downtown Guntersville. Larry's communication was outstanding - he was quick to respond, and checked in several times with me during my stay. I had a really nice stay, and would definitely recommend the cottage if you're coming to Guntersville."

There is a dog park, a playground, walking path, fishing pier, lake access, etc all within walking distance. There is a strip mall right across the way as well and the Lodge and state park is a short drive away. Larry and Monica thought of everyone for our stay including the dog. The fenced in back yard and screened in porch were wonderful as well. We hope to return to Guntersville and would definitely book this house again if it is available!"

Stayed a few nights","Larry’s home was perfect for our stay! A nice, updated 50’s style home, reminiscent of grandma’s homestead (without the clutter 😉). The bedrooms were large with wonderfully comfortable beds. The added tv in the master was a nice addition although not used in our case. Access to a large laundry room with supplies was nice also. The kitchen was a little small, but well-equipped. The Keurig with a hand full of samples was easy to operate. There was also a nice little screened porch out back that would’ve been perfect for a coffee quiet time, if only there was time. 😉
Overall, I would highly recommend Larry’s place. His communication was exemplary The best part was that the home was only a block from the magnificent lake with a nice park with tables and a front row seat to a flock of Canadian geese and their chicks.
A side note, my daughter and I came up from Fl to do some hiking post-grad decompression 😁. The first day, we went to Bethel Spring/falling Sink which was a moderate 2mile trail to a lovely waterfall. The second day, we hiked Stephen’s Gap (listed as 1.4miles, but seemed longer). This was extremely challenging and you have to sign a waiver and agree to wear helmets etc, but the cave/waterfall were amazing to see! Both trails were about 30 minutes from the house and the scenery en route was so serene and beautiful as it was accompanied by open fields, wild flowers, livestock and horses. In all, I would give Guntersville a five star rating for a peaceful vacation destination."
