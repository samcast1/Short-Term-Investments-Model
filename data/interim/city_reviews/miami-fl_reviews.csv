Very nicely decorated, very well-equipped kitchen with plenty of capsules for coffee 😉👍The bathroom is small but functional. It feels fast at home. Calle ocho is a quick walk away. Johanna is super friendly. It was a pleasure! Thank you!"

Those who have no problem driving are in good hands here with the price/performance ratio. We felt very comfortable.

Stayed a few nights","We had the opportunity to stay here during a two day spell, and while we had some issues during our stay, we would confidently stay here again.
Location is great - Little Havana has so much to offer, and my wife and I felt like this place was a great access point to great food and culture…we even got to meet the neighborhood cat and chickens!
We had an issue with the AC, as we originally were not able to change the temperature. With a quick note to our host and a switch of some batteries, we were able to figure it out.
We also had an issue with the bathroom: the lights didn’t work, and the light fixture fell and shattered, but with a quick message to Johanna, she immediately offered to refund part of our stay.
All in all, we were provided excellent customer service, and while we had issues, Johanna made it whole and was extremely responsive throughout our stay. Would definitely recommend staying here."

If you like soft beds, you’ll love the queen bed. The futon was a little hard and difficult to sleep on for our daughter, but we knew the second “bed” would be like this and it is no fault of Johanna."

Stayed a few nights","-The place looked great in the pictures and had great comments which I always checked to make a decision to rent a Airbnb, However we did not like this place, when we got there the cigarette smell was awful even though on the rules it says smoking is not allowed we could barely cope with it, the host said it was the previous guests that left the place in bad conditions and with that smell, if that was really the case she should have let us know about the situation so it was our decision if we wanted to stay there still, we were never communicated that the whole place had a excessive cigarette smell.
-Place needs some painting inside.
-The shower needs some good cleaning
-There is a fence outside the place that is falling apart it makes the place feel unsafe.
Host was responsive and help us with the remote not working.
We did not have a good experience here unfortunately."

Stayed one night","Johanna’s Place is clean and cute, and with comfortable bedding. It was perfect for an overnight stay in the Little Havana section of Miami. My wife and I selected her place in part for its proximity to Calle Ocho, and that worked out well. Walking over to the trendy restaurants and bars in the late-afternoon/early evening took just 15 minutes and felt totally safe, despite some stretches of the route being a bit run-down. Being totally new to the area and not knowing ‘the vibe’ of walking off the beaten path later in the evening, we decided to play it easy and safe and opted for a $6 Uber ride back, and that worked out great."

It was a very unpleasant situation, I was only able to access the space and my belongings at 7:00am."

There were a few hiccups however, the mini fridge started leaking and then the kitchen sink faucet popped right off when water was running and got a lot of the kitchenette and floor wet. Johannna was extremely fast at responding and everything was taken care of within minutes of telling them what happened.
Overall, we had a great time. Just wished things were double checked a little more thoroughly.

Stayed a few nights","The listing is as described and is a tidy, compact studio a few blocks away from Calle Ocho in Little Havana. It’s the ideal size for a solo traveler but might be a bit cramped for two (my friend stayed the second night on the futon during a two night stay on our way to a trip overseas). The unit is stocked with essentials (cutlery, linens, etc), but also thoughtful extras (aloe gel, condiments etc) which comes in handy. During our stay, we had a bit of trouble with the digital key entry and it ended up locking us out, but Johanna replied back almost instantaneously and told us how to access an emergency key box located right by the door. She was very responsive throughout the whole booking process and stay. The neighborhood is in Little Havana so we did hear some wild roosters crowing about (they’re a hallmark of the area), but we both had earplugs and this wasn’t really an issue for us. The unit is just close enough to Calle Ocho to be convenient but far enough to not be disruptive."

Parking space was very valuable as spaces on the street would have been hard to come by. It’s a short walk from here to Little Havana, and that was a wonderful outing. And it’s not too far to Bayfront area (but farther than a walk). There was a problem at one point with the electronic lock on the door, but the host took care of it while I was away."

She was very responsive and got back to me right away with any concerns I had, which weren’t many haha. The space is comfortable and has everything you’ll need as a home base. About a 15 min walk from the colorful and lively Calle Ocho and a swift 15 min drive to Miami Beach!
I would recommend staying with Johanna if you’re visiting Miami!"

Although we do not need it also allowed us to be flexible with check-out time.
The place is very well equipped, it has towels, soap, even chairs and umbrellas to take to the beach. Very complete.
The area is super safe and quiet.

All the amenities of home, clean, private and in a fantastic location.
Bed was very comfortable. And cute little touches here and there. Close to all the shopping and restaurants, easy to get in and out of. The keypad was a little tricky at first for the door but easy and convenient to use. Glad not to have to keep track of a key or card!
As to the comments about the neighborhood...I traveled with my adult niece. We found the neighborhood is so cute, and quiet. We had no issues at all with anyone and never felt like we were unsafe being there. We were out in the early morning, and late in the evening.
I would stay here again without hesitation and highly recommend it to anyone visiting the area."

It has everything you need: toaster, microwave, pans, pots, plates, glasses… etc. It has products that come well to cook like oil, salt, etc…
Bed is comfortable bed and so is a sofa bed. Soft, clean towels and linens.
The location is ideal. Look for Calle Ocho walking, it doesn't take any time. Neighborhood with atmosphere and all services nearby: restaurants, supermarkets, points to see. The airport is 14 euros Uber and South Beach is about $18 Uber ride.
If I go back to Miami I will repeat location and house. Recommended."

Hostess - The hostess is amazing. She always responded very quickly and went out of her way to ensure I was comfortable and had everything I needed.
Location - It’s a 5 minute walk from the exciting Calle Ocho and a 10 minute drive from Brickell City Centre. 15 minute drive to South Beach and Wynwood. It’s close to everything. Also about 15 minutes to the nearest beach and the Miami airport.
Safety - the neighborhood is very quiet and I felt safe walking around solo both day and night. I even had some mail delivered there with no issues. You may hear some roosters though!
Studio - The place was very clean, comfortable, and overall practical. I was even able to extend the table to fit my 3 computers so I could work remotely.
This is the best bang for buck spot you’ll get!"

Do not wear white socks cause you will them see how the floors need to be steam cleaned, your socks will be black.
There is a small sitting area you can’t enjoy cause the entire fence is falling apart with nails sticking out and 2x 4 holding it up. Very unsafe.
But overall it’s a cute place just some small things that need to be fixed and corrected."

Stayed a few nights","Wonderful stay at a luxury property for much less than a hotel room would be. The condo was extremely clean, and exactly as described/pictured. The bed was very comfortable and there were tons of extra pillows and towels, plus plenty of dishes/kitchen ware, etc. Having a washer/dryer in the unit was very convenient (although the dryer took a many cycles to actually dry the clothes, so don’t wash anything right before leaving!). The private furnished balcony really set this unit apart from other similar Airbnbs in this neighborhood, and the view was really awesome. You will have to restock coffee pods/TP etc if you’re staying more than a couple days, but there is a 24-hour Walgreens right across the street.
Very smooth check-in and check-out process, very communicative host, and you really do get full access to the entire resort (all the pools and the beach amenities). It was pricey, but we definitely don’t regret it!"

While I appreciated the helpfulness of the concierge, I did feel their presence more than I expected, which detracted a bit from the privacy I usually enjoy with Airbnb stays. Additionally, there were minor issues with some dark spots in the bathroom tile grout.
Overall, it was a delightful retreat, perfect for a relaxing beach vacation. I'd consider returning in the future."

Difficult to find parking in evenings
Bed extremely uncomfortable (mattress too soft & can feel the springs, paper thin sheets, stained comforter)
Zero amenities and overall feels more like a motel than beach airbnb

Stayed a few nights","This stay was in a really lovely, quiet location and so close to the beach. They were very accommodating and allowed us to drop off our luggage early and leave it with them while waiting for our flight. They also offered a late check out which was great. Room was comfortable - comfortable temperature - nice large tvs - just a cute stay with some nice stylish touches. The only thing to make it absolutely perfect would be to have someone on site at all times but truly not a complaint and just a suggestion! Additionally - they left beach chairs for us in our room upon arrival which was super generous. Overall great stay and worth the price. Would stay here again.
It is also quite close to Cafe Sazon which we were obsessed with. Walk here if you can before hitting the beach!
If you’re looking for a relaxed beach stay where you can grab food and drinks and sit at the beach in peace and quiet this is the place. Thank you for a great stay!!"

The building was noisy, neighbors/other tenants were very rowdy, and the fire alarm went off at 8am Friday morning and while I know that was out of the control of the host it was still bothersome. I don’t believe it was worth the price I paid for it per night, kitchen was lacking a few things that would have been useful (like dish soap, a cutting board, and a basic of salt & pepper would have been nice). But overall, it was a good stay."

Stayed a few nights","Absolutely amazing place if you look for something peaceful in Miami Beach but at the same time not far from everything.
The location is very convenient - the beach is just two blocks away, very clean beach and water, plenty of space, very nice boardwalk, volleyball terrains on the beach. All the amenities are also very close - many stores , restaurants, coffee shops etc. There is trolley stop that could be used to go to the South Beach. For those with car - the nearby street parking is free, but on first come first serve basis, so on weekends the spots are almost always occupied, but on weekdays - there is no issue to park. In any case -quite nearby there is a huge outdoor municipal parking lot that does not cost a lot and sometimes is free.
The apartment itself if very clean and convenient. We had two rooms, with the one which is purely for sleeping and another as a hybrid bedroom/living room. Bathroom is convenient as well and air conditioning is powerful and not noisy. I recommend"

Bad mattress, causes back pain.
There is no change of towels, which I think is inadmissible for 8 days. For the price paid, very little delivery. There is no courtesy of coffee or tea at the accommodation.
Parking as listed, and Free ( if you find vacant!!!)
They should put this on the ad.
The host, very polite and helpful, note 10.
Improve the quality of the towels and change of mattresses."

Stayed a few nights","This place a cute stay for my fiancé and I! It was 3-4 blocks from the beach which was awesome! However, the space would be a bit tight for more than 2 people. It also was very loud at night. You could easily hear the neighbors.
The air bnb photos were not very accurate. The air bnb I thought we booked had a separate room with a bed in it; however, the space we got had the bed right as you walked into the front door. No separation from the kitchen and the bed room. Very limited utensils/kitchen supplies in the unit though. Could use a scissors, useable knives, garbage bags, more towels, etc.
Overall, made a great little stay for a couple nights though! The space was nice, clean, and cute!"

Stayed a few nights","Pros:
- The area was very safe and quiet
- Walking distance to plenty of food and to the beach
- Two TVs in the AirBnB
- Bed was comfy and air conditioning worked well
- The host is super friendly, nice and communicates well. He is near the property if you ever need anything
Cons:
- Parking is awful, you need to get lucky to get parking (or there is a parking lot about a block away but you’ll need to pay like $5 to park car overnight)
- The host will charge $15 for extra towels
Overall:
This a nice place to stay, especially for the price. Parking and the extra towels fee are annoying but the AirBnB is still a nice place to stay, especially if you’re downing most of your time on the beach or out exploring and just need a place to sleep for the night."

Parking is plentiful in the day time but you may need to park in a lot nearby after 8 - it is free. we stayed in Unit 10 which was in the back near the cleaning area and trash can are located behind and a little noisy on trash day - might be other units that have a better location - Ernesto was very attentive and friendly. we liked that it had two different codes for security.

Stayed a few nights","I had high expectations after seeing all the five-star reviews, but was left a bit disappointed. The room was much smaller than I thought it would be and it didn’t feel very private either as people would frequently walk past our biggest window which was directly next to the bed. We sunk into the bed and I had to make my own pillow by folding up a blanket because the pillows were extremely over-the-top fluffy. For whatever reason my partner did not get even one good night’s sleep.
The owner approached us several times and though he seemed nice it was clear that his English wasn’t very good and so we were hesitant to share this information anticipating that it likely wouldn’t be understood. Thank you for the effort, but all in all this felt like staying in an expensive hostel."

What's worth the additional attention: (1) the parking lot is on the street (public) and if you arrive after 10:30 pm it's very complicated and difficult to find spots. (2) depending on your neighbor next door or above, if the neighbor speaks loudly or stepping/walking hard you hear the noises or voices. (3) the bathroom box only partially covers the shower area and gets the area (outside the box) very wet after the shower."

Situated 2 blocks off of Collins in a quiet residential area, it was quiet and peaceful yet close to all of the action. Great restaurants, bars, and a beautiful beach within walking distance. Cachito Coffee and Bakery, Burgers and Shakes, and El Grande Rancho were my favorites nearby. 15-20 min Uber to South Beach, Brickell, etc.
The best part about this booking was meeting the property manager Mr. Ernesto. He was kind and very polite and made us feel safe and welcomed. We will definitely book again on our next trip to Miami Beach!"

The place was in a very quiet neighborhood and close to lots of great restaurants and only 2 blocks to the beach. We spent the week walking and biking to mid-beach and to south beach from this location with no problems at all. We had our coffee and breakfast at Sazon and the Argentine bakery across the street daily, and had several of our dinners within walking distance as well. This really was the perfect location for us, and we would highly recommend. The unit was clean, with plenty of supplies. The bed was comfortable and we had everything we needed. The unit was behind a security gate in the courtyard which made us feel extra secure. Thank you so much to our host Ernesto, we will be back for sure!"

Stayed a few nights","I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in Miami! Max was super responsive and handled any need I had during my stay. The condo is spotless, comfy and mirrors the pictures. The floor-to-ceiling windows provide a spectacular view and abundant natural light. Check-in and parking details are concise and require several steps to officially check-in. There’s an active construction site right next to the building that you can see and hear from the condo. Work begins early in the morning (before 7 am) through the evening. The noise didn’t bother my family, but it does obstruct the views and can impact the “vibes” of your stay and sleep. The area is walkable, with various places to eat and socialize. Miami Beach and Wynwood are 30-40 minutes away. There’s a tasty vegan restaurant across the street (in the Connect Four building) that’s open late called The Cocinita. Overall, it was a wonderful and worthwhile stay! Go ahead and book it!"

Group trip","We had an amazing time in Miami thanks to Max and his beautiful, centrally located home in Brickell. Max was incredibly responsive, and ensured my group of friends was safe, and had plenty of amenities and recommendations to choose from. The apartment itself is sizable. For each person to have their own bed, the max would be 4, but we were 5 and slept comfortably. One thing I will say is that there is a bit of construction that makes it noisy outside, but that can easily be solved with some earplugs.
A huge plus is that we were just a short drive to Miami Beach, and to all the major hot spots.
All in all, we had the best time, much in part due to Max and all of his help!"

The layout and decor of the space was great, the bed was very comfortable and cozy (great pillows). The shower was awesome though the bathroom can get steamy as there is no vent and windows don't open (it's a Florida thing, to avoid mold growth in the HVAC). The AC worked perfectly. We loved having a free washer/dryer because we could go home with clean clothes (tip: bring your own detergent pods or plan to buy a bag at the CVS, a five minute walk from the AirBnB).
Small suggestions: include ground coffee/coffee filters for the coffee machine & provide at least salt and pepper and hot sauce. On the other hand, this very sweet host provided eggs, milk, cereal, and a couple canned Starbucks!! Would DEFINITELY stay here again if in Miami!!!"

Stayed a few nights","We had an amazing stay! The location is perfect - tons of restaurants, bars, and shops in walking distance (the Grove has changed a lot since I grew up but I welcome a lot of the new additions). We were grateful that the Airbnb was gated with a parking spot, and we were pleasantly surprised how quiet the nights were despite how close we were to the heart of the Grove. Carlos and his assistants were extremely responsive and proactive at offering services such as RoomBox (we didn’t take advantage of what they had to offer but it was nice to have the option). Also, it was awesome to have access to a washer/dryer as well. We would absolutely stay here again!"

But this place was immaculate. It was super clean and the nice way they have it decorated makes it feel fresh and like you are staying in a high end hotel. The location is also awesome. We really enjoyed being able to just walk into town, especially as parking is such a pain in Coconut Grove. I emailed to ask a question and the hosts replied right away. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"

Stayed about a week","The place was as we expected it to be - nice, clean, comfortable, good location. We arrived in Miami early in the morning and I think 4pm is very late to check-in, so we went to the Biltmore for a night. Carlos did try to arrange an earlier check-in, but we were already at the hotel by then. I also think the policy of no unregistered guests extremely draconian, not even a friend is allowed to drop by for coffee, hmmm. But overall I would recommend this place to others, if they do not mind the isolation."

Two TV's in close proximity with two controls was a bit of a trick to control and finding desired stations was not easy. A single bowl kitchen sink made it hard to wash dishes. Every room area was very clean and fresh.

Host was very accommodating and extremely prompt with response, I couldn’t have asked for a better experience!

There are 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom inside the house and to one side is the third room with its own bathroom however access to this space is on one side of the house, it is a mini independent apartment, eye: to take into account especially if you go with children and want a third bedroom. The pool with very nice temperature and the very nice garden, however you must have a car to get to the tourist areas of Miami. Bring mosquito and bug repellent as there are a lot of bugs around the big garden. Check-in and check-out time is very strict, there is no early check-in, no late check-out. For the price it's a nice house."

Stayed with kids","Ricky and Jose’s place was awesome. We spent most of our time in the lovely oasis in the beautiful spacious backyard with swimming, parrot watching, and in total relaxation mode. The modern house was nicely decorated, and we especially loved the comfy beds and black out shades. We were very central and 20 minutes or less from South Beach, Bal Harbor, Wynwood and more. We took our kids to the seaquarium, found a great little Korean restaurant near by as well as amazing Italian at Osteria. Ricky was very responsive, kind and accommodating. We hope to be back!"

Stayed a few nights","Really, overall the house and hosts were great. We especially enjoyed the pool and backyard and quiet street. Pool was my highlight.
Our challenge was we didn’t realize that the two main bedrooms would be so small. Pretty & comfortable but no room to hang in.
The description was not misleading but we assumed there would be a way to watch in bed like our previous rentals. So if u wanna chill and watch you would need to go to the main room and sit on the pink arm chairs or on the blue couch.
This house is best for teens and couples.
Not ideal for children. No bedroom space for a crib and no bathtub.
The 3rd bedroom (suite) is not attached to main house. Different entrance… so again works for teens or a couple, but not safe for children.
Summary, if you don’t watch in bed, and if you don’t use a tub, and are happy to hang out in main room, this house is perfect!"

However we had three amazing days in this place. Beautiful backyard with parrots and butterflies. Enjoyed the salt water pool and charcoal barbecue every day. The house it self was very modern and well equipped. Richard and Jose did an amazing job to make us feel welcome and did everything they could to sort out the situation described above.

The pool is wonderful with a great sun shelf and the yard is beautifully landscaped with gorgeous palms and flowers everywhere. With the large covered back patio we were able to to sit outside and enjoy the beautiful landscaping even during the occasional rain shower. The home is beautiful and elegant and the beds were incredibly comfy. The hosts responded to questions immediately and went out of the way to make sure we knew where everything was and had what we needed. Neighborhood was quiet and peaceful but we got ubers into downtown Miami easily and it was just a quick ride. We will absolutely be returning!

Not something alot of people would do . The house is exactly as pictured . We loved the pool , the nature surrounding it and the location.

There was so much life in this property, from beautiful plants, butterflies, parrots, we even got to see an iguana passing through. Tall palm trees and coconut trees... this was far beyond my expectation. This property was top 3 of all my experiences with AirBnB.
The hosts were AMAZING!! Very considerate, communication was top tier and nothing but kind from start to finish. Anytime I visit Miami the future, fingers will be crossed that this property is available.
Do I recommend a stay here? The answer is YOU HAVEN'T LIVED UNTIL YOU STAY HERE!!

The beautiful Art covers the walls and the furniture is as comfortable as the beds we slept in. The kitchen is practical and convenient while the dinning area is stunning with windows that allows you to admire the backyard from within. The backyard is probably the highlight to our stay with a heated pool, butterfly sanctuary and hammock that will put you straight to sleep under the Florida sun. Theres so much more but we’ll let you discover it all for yourself. We can’t wait to get back. Oh and I cannot forget to mention how gracious our host were to us, answering our every call and request. We can’t stop thanking them for sharing their homes with us."

Stayed a few nights","My family had a fantastic stay at Ricky and Jose's house! It was the perfect spot for our family of four (though more people could stay comfortably). The pool was so warm and was in such a beautifully maintained backyard. Lots of lounging options around the pool. And we ate breakfast and lunch outside at the table under the tent every day. (Dinner would be great there, too, but we went out to eat.) The beds were very comfortable. The kitchen was very well-equipped and easy to use. Location is great -- just 20 or so minutes to Miami Beach. We also went to the Everglades which is about 30 minutes away and the Miami airport is about 20 (in no traffic). Ricky was very available for questions. Overall it's a fantastic house!"

If you prefer a more private and seamless check-in though you should know when we got inside after a long drive, wanting to just settle in and relax, I could see someone at the front door who was there to give a tour of the place and explain everything. Personally I prefer to read house instructions to make the stay feel private. Apart from that it was great, the hosts were very communicative and kind and made sure everything was all set."

Stayed with kids","The house was impeccably clean and pretty comfortable. The pool and garden are outstanding - beautiful landscaping and a nice large covered area to get out of the sun/rain. We loved the outdoor shower too. One thing that surprised us was the third bedroom and second bath are not connected to the rest of the house - you have to go outside and around to the side of the house to a separate entrance to access them. This didn't cause problems for us, but might for others. Another surprise was that the kitchen countertops are all covered with a clear plastic sheeting to protect them, which we found really unattractive and kind of a pain to work on. The kitchen is moderately well-stocked with pots & pans, etc. The location of the house is not particularly convenient to anything, unfortunately. We were surprised what a project it was to get to a beach - more than once sitting in traffic for 40 minutes to get across the causeway. But if you just want to relax around the pool, this is a great choice!"

Stayed about a week","Richard And Jose’s house is an absolute gem. They are kind and responsive hosts; the house is beautifully designed and very comfortable; and the backyard is just stunning. The covered patio, the fully fenced yard with beautiful tropical plantings, the saltwater pool, the outdoor shower—we loved spending time in this secluded and peaceful outdoor haven, soaking up the sun. The energy of the whole place is very restful and restorative. Also, I know Miami well and I appreciated the location: it’s a quiet street, with friendly neighbors, but you’re a very short and easy drive from culinary and cultural destinations in Wynwood, Little River, Design District, etc. Perfect if you want to be close to a lot of activity but also want to avoid dealing with a lot of city noise and tricky parking. My husband and I have stayed in many different AirBnBs around the world and this is one of the absolute best. I can’t recommend Richard And Jose’s place highly enough."

Stayed over a week","I did not know you can make friends on AirBnb! Ricky was more than our host, he became our friend during our stay and having him around during our stay made our vacation complete. His place is more than perfect for 4, the pictures posted are exactly what you will get! His private back yard is HUGE and the pool is so beautiful. He even has a coconut tree at the back of the yard! I found at his place the coziness from my home and during my 3 weeks stay it truly became my second home. His home description is 100% accurate. I would rate my stay at 6stars but 5stars is max! Thank you Ricky for making our vacation perfect!"

Parking is definitely 1st come 1st serve & it’s a bit tight spaced. We had to ask & pay the hotel next door to park. It wouldn’t have been an issue but other guest parked over the yellow lines. Overall loved our stay.

Stayed a few nights","First issue was the AC, they do not cool the room enough on the third floor. We had to purchase a fan and that barely helped. The owner did send maintenance but these are just old AC units. He also did switch our room, the second room was maybe a couple degrees cooler, luckily we had purchased the fan. Second, there was other people’s hair on the showers. You can notice the showers haven’t been scrubbed. There was mold under the shower mat as well. Third was the sheets and pillow cases have stains on them, very visible yellow stains. There is mold under the sink and everywhere. The space is much smaller than expected. We had a big cockroach in the room which then makes you question is there more roaches anywhere else and makes the stay uneasy. This is not at all like the pictures. The seller did have great communication overall but since I left there has been no further communication on how to resolve this."

Room location is on the back of the house so it's not noisy. You have windows on two walls so ventilation of the room is good and you have enough natural light. I like clean design of the place and perfume smell in the corridors. We always had parking spots available. Host was very responsive and helpful. Location of the building is near bus station. You have a lot of places around where you can eat and drink, gallery and park with weekend market where you can go :) You have iron and hairdryer in the room. And you always have clean towels and other toiletries available."

I guess no noise insulation, which could be disruptive at times. While the area may seem a bit sketchy, we found it to be safe during our stay. However, if you have mobility issues, be aware that navigating the stairs can be a challenge. Room changing might also be a bit tricky, but the staff probably works to accommodate requests. Overall, this hotel is a solid choice if you are not that picky."

Stayed a few nights","Don’t be fooled by the overly edited photos and low pricing. This place was horrible. Dirty lobby and stairs, no elevator, sketchy neighborhood, and super thin walls. Sleeping here feels like you’re in a parking lot next to a highway and train tracks, because you are. The windows and walls are so thin that they might as well be open air. You can hear people in neighboring rooms and CONSTANT traffic, horns, and motorcycles outside. The bathrooms were also old and dirty with stained floors and room smelled musty. I left after the first night of no sleep and booked a vacation rental. Before I checked out, the management agreed to give me a refund then changed their mind after leading me on for 11 days that they were “processing” it. This was the worst hotel experience I’ve ever had in Miami and I’ve been traveling there for ten years. Make sure to check the online reviews for Treehouse Studio Hotel before booking and you’ll see what I mean. Mostly 1-2 star ratings. Avoid at all costs."

It’s an old motel which has been partially renovated but still has a motel vibe. There was a stench in the hallways. The bathroom was not properly cleaned. Not worth the money, could find better options for this price, as well as an accurate description. The location was pretty good. Bianca was very good at commentating and helpful when we needed her, the was the plus side! Side note: they are also offering future discounts at the end of your stay if you leave them a 5 star review, which could be why their reviews are so high."

Stayed a few nights",Super responsive and proactive hosts; checking in throughout the stay and just overall kind and helpful. Room was as shown in pictures. The bed was so comfy. Bathroom was a bit tight but met our needs. We were in a room facing the main road which made it quite noisy so we used a white noise sound on my phone which helped tremendously. The entire building was clean and smelled so good everytime we entered. Location is central to many things and easy to get around. We loved the gym a few blocks down and the ramen spot open until 5am! Will love to return to this stay.

Stayed a few nights","I had an exceptional experience at Mine's Place hosted by Nancie! Right from the start, the communication was outstanding, and Nancie proved to be an incredibly accommodating and welcoming host. The accuracy of the listing was spot-on, capturing the essence of the space perfectly – from the cozy ambiance to the well-appointed amenities. The location of Mine's Place was ideal for my visit, offering easy access to local attractions and conveniences. The space itself was meticulously clean and well-maintained, which made my stay even more comfortable.
Overall, I wholeheartedly recommend Mine's Place to anyone planning a visit to the area. Nancie's hospitality and the charm of the place made my stay memorable. I'm looking forward to returning in the future. Thank you, Nancie, for making my stay so pleasant!"

Stayed a few nights","Check in was extremely easy. The room was just like the photos, clean and plenty of space. Everything you need for a quick stay. There isn't a front desk employee but they are extremely responsive over the Airbnb chat. Didn't have any issues during the stay, everything in my room was fine. The hallways smell a bit musty but it's an old building so that's kind of expected. The AC in my room was great, very cold and you can easily adjust with a remote. Bed was comfortable. The location itself isn't in a tourist hotspot but you're a 10-15 minute drive to busy areas. You can hear a lot of traffic driving by during the daytime. Obviously less noise at night but keep in mind the walls are thin (it's an old building). Don't expect a high end hotel here but it's a good value for your money in Miami."

Stayed a few nights","Bianca was a very responsive host, good communication. This is a 3 story building with 8 rooms on each floor. Our room was located on the 3rd floor towards the main street. Here are the pros & cons you need to be aware off:
Pros:
- Silent mini-split air conditioning in room (negated by noise level coming in from street)
- located close to bus stop for using public transport
- spacious room
Cons:
- No elevator, lugging 2x50 pound suitcases up two floors might not be for everyone
- Single pane windows let all the street noise in unfiltered, it is like sleeping next to the road.
- Bare bones: 2xbath towels, no hand towels or wash cloth, no cutlery, plates, cups or any other kind of dishes, so if you want to use the provided microwave you need to bring your own
- ""window"" in bathroom was a piece of glass without frame, meaning it could not be opened.
- Carpet on staircase very stained/worn down.
- you are being asked to dump your trash in yard container, despite $69 cleaning fee"

We communicated this to Bianca and she proactively provided us a room at The Julia to accommodate us regarding the room we were staying in. She was wonderful and super helpful, even went above and beyond to make our trip better since we didn't sleep much the first night.
My biggest complaint personally would be that the rentals smell like an Abercrombie Fitch store which really irritates my nose. If that's not a problem for ya, I think this is a great place to stay.
Thanks Bianca."

Too bad it wasn't clean when you entered while the cost of cleaning is overly high it's really not worth it.
Furthermore, I was happy with Netflix only the Television is really not in a good place ,I got neck pain .
My son had chosen this place for him it was good (17) but for me he didn't like it.
Furthermore, the location is easy to do with the bus and there is plenty of parking space ."

Stayed a few nights","This was a lovely place to stay for a few days. We enjoyed being there from the beginning, but as we got around and saw more of Miami (and Florida) we realized how special it was. A couple of things to be mindful of: getting in through the gate is a bit tricky the first couple of times because it faces the corner of a busy street. You can hear the traffic from the pool area. The kitchen is on the dark side. But the pluses are many. Despite the previously mentioned noise, we loved being by the pool. The setting is very tranquil. Was nice for swimming, too. The vegetation is tropical, attractive, and sheltering. There are a couple of beautiful cats in residence--friendly ones that like being petted. It's an easy drive from the place to Calle Ocho, and there's a Publix grocery story a few minutes' drive in the other direction (part of a fancy, multistory complex overlooking a canal full of yachts). You can walk one block to a Walgreens, if you need a quart of milk."

Even though there is some road noise, the enclosed backyard feels private and like a little oasis, with a pool and gorgeous plants. Deborah's very friendly cat visited us while we sat outside. Love that there is off-street parking available. It's about a one-mile walk to Calle Ocho, which we felt perfectly safe doing. Would definitely stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","A very lovely place. Parking especially exiting the property is a bit harrowing as you're blindly backing out of property into the street. Bathroom has no window or ventilation exhaust fan...minimally a deodorizing spray should be readily available. It was easier to use Lyft pickup services than to back the truck off of property. Very close to (5 minutes) Little Havana's most popular strip (Calle Ocho). Excellent Cuban food, music and dance places on the strip. The queen size mattress could use updating as it was too soft and wasn't a good sleep for neither me or my girlfriend. A nice place overall!"

Her home was clean, looked just like the photos, and was exactly as described. Beware that the bed is super comfortable - especially after a long night out - and you may not want to get up the next day, I sure didn't! Deborah's place is also centrally located, and getting around the city and surrounding areas with either a ride share or a rental was super convenient. I would book it again and highly recommend it to others looking to feel right at home."

We enjoyed using the heated spa in the evenings and the pool during the daytime as well as having our morning coffee poolside.

Stayed a few nights","Although the place is clean and in a convenient location, I would not recommend it.
The bedroom was hot and smelled like mold. You don’t have access to adjusting the AC, and when I asked the host to turn down the temperature, the host came to our door and suggested tips on how to use the table fan instead of accommodating to our request. This made our stay uncomfortable. I was passing through Miami for a day so it was not worth going to another Airbnb, but I would not recommend this to someone who runs warm or dislikes asking multiple times for requests.
Other than this, the pool was nice and we loved interacting with the two cats outside our home, they were very sweet."

Stayed a few nights","Overall it was a nice stay in Deborah’s place. She is easy to communicate with and kindly helped us and did our laundry as it was almost the end of our US trip we were out of clean t-shirts 😉. She was always there for us. We loved 2 friendly cats that we could pet 🐈
About the studio:
A small molded odor in all parts of the studio.
The kitchen is quite dark as there is a door with a blind to separate it from the private part of the house.
The bathroom is very small.
The bed is very high, as I am not a tall person it wasn't easy to climb on.
The parking place: at the check-in, Deborah’s husband gave us very detailed and a bit rude instructions on how to park our car. We were told not to touch the lawn in any case. Surprisingly in the evening on game days (there is a stadium nearby) we were asked to park on the street which we refused since we had a rented high-end car, while the visitor's (clients) cars were parked on the lawn sic!"

Stayed a few nights","The location was great for where I needed to be. But the fact that they entered the unit without my prior knowledge at least twice marred my entire experience. The first day when I got there I realized that there were no access to channels on the tv. I reached out and husband came, realized that the infinity app wasn't downloaded on it, offered to get it sorted it and I told him then and there that it was ok. He insisted and I said it's not necessary I'll hardly be indoors. He left and messaged that he'd come to fix it and I never responded giving permission to. When I returned later that night, the app was loaded. I said nothing. The next day I saw the wife and I told her that the wifi signal was poor. She said she knew router was broken and a new one was coming in that day. I said ok. Later that day she texted that problem was fixed. I asked if they entered without my permission because it was not necessary. She downplayed it but router in the unit was missing when I returned."

Parking was super easy to access and we loved that it was gated, so our rental car was secure at night.

The location is superb for getting around Miami, with plenty of local restaurants and essentials within walking distance. We drove from Orlando and found the place very easily and felt extremely comfortable that our hire car was safely parked in the gated property! For those unsure of tourists reviews on a location, we were visiting friends that live in Miami and they agreed that it was a superb location and a safe neighbourhood!
The guest house itself has everything you would need and is far superior and much more affordable than any hotel you would find in the city! Unfortunately we just didn’t have time to use the pool or spa as we were too busy during our stay but the area itself was lovely and even just sitting in our garden felt like an escape from the hustle and bustle! A special mention should be made for how comfortable the bed was!
Deborah’s communication was superb from the moment of booking and her recommendations were fantastic - especially the Ball and Chain bar! Check in was simple and whilst we didn’t need anything we felt confident knowing that we could ask anything whether it be advice or an additional request.
We would highly recommend this stay and wouldn’t hesitate to return on our next visit to Miami!"

We had to move after the first night because the mattress is really soft and i had a back problem but he helped us very kindly with everything. The location is close to little havana which is great if you like to dance salsa, and 10min drive from Miami beach.
They have a nice little swimming pool. The room is large and there is a lonely planet about Miami available."

Location was good especially for Little Havana restaurants. One thing I didn’t notice in any other reviews is there is a Roku with access to all the streaming sites you’d need for a night in, and a fan and white noise machine which was great for sleeping. Good hot water and shower pressure. We didn’t use the kitchen much but it was fully equipped. We didn’t hear any noise from the street despite being by a busy road. I would stay again!"

It was great to have easy access to our own pool area especially if we didn't feel like going to the beach and wanted to relax nearby. There was easy access to stores just around the block and everything was neat and tidy. Deborah went above and beyond to make us fee happy. She even lent us her beach umbrella for the few days we stated with her which was incredibly nice of her. I cannot recommend this airbnb enough! I will definitely be coming back when i next visit Miami.

The apartments is private, secure and a. short walk from the Cuban District for great nights out, restaurant and dancing. This home is spotlessly clean and well laid out with all the welcome packs you need, and a bed while is very luxurious, comfortable and a perfect nest to spend the night.
Deborah and family helped with everything on hand to answer questions and offer advice which really added to our stay. Thank you so much Deborah!"

I was in town for a series at marlins park and you cannot ask for a better location. The pool and lounge chairs were an amazing amenity as well. Definitely one of the most comfortable beds I have slept in within air bnb. My flight arrived fairly early and I was able to check in early with ease. All communication with deb was extremely quick. Being in an area where there’s a lot going on, you are tucked away in a location with lots of privacy and amenities.
The room itself stayed pretty cool which was nice after being out in the sun all day. For those people that like a fan, there is one in the room as well. There is also no shortage of outlet/USB space.
I will be back to Deb’s for my next trip to Miami."

The bathroom even has a bathtub if you want to draw yourself a relaxing bath. There’s tv in the room and you can watch Netflix for free. The wifi is fast and reliable. There’s a pool outside with a hot tub - just let Deborah know if you want to use the jacuzzi so they can set it up for you in advance. They respect your privacy and they will stay out of your way unless you need help on anything. Deborah even prepared a portfolio for tourist spot suggestions, restaurants etc. She is friendly and very, very kind - we feel like her own family! She deserves to be a super host!

Stayed a few nights","My fiance and I visited over MDW. We wanted something away from the Miami craziness but also nearby so we can check out the scene. The house itself is beautiful. We had an early flight to MIA/late flight back home and Deborah was very accommodating and held our luggage while we went to explore. She gave us some tips on places nearby. If you're okay with walking, Little Havana is not too far. Uber and Lyft is super affordable to get around. Overall, we paid $4-$10 to get around. This includes going to Miami Beach and Wynwood. The studio itself is very comfortable and cute. Even though the studio is part of the house, Deborah and her family gave us privacy. The pool is perfection. There were days we couldn't make it to the beach so we opted for the pool. We would definitely return back!"

Stayed a few nights",Musty and Damp- but great spot and great host communication. Super friendly staff and great spot with CitiBikes available to ride everywhere.. But yeah. Extremely musty and damp- left clothes and hair smelling. Staff brought in a dehumidifier which helped but the smell is just everywhere so even though they were willing to change our room I don’t think it would have mattered. If you just are looking for a place to lay your head and be outside most of the time and are on a budget this would be a spot for you if you can handle sleeping in an aquarium and loud AC/dehumidifier going constantly. Staff was really great- just the building is musty and damp.

Pro’s:
+ Clean room with a cafe right on the premises.
+ Host was attentive and friendly and stayed in touch with us via the app.
+ AC/ heater worked well.
+ Modern decor with everything well placed.
+ Mini fridge and safe in room
Con’s
- No deadbolt or safety lock on the door to prevent anyone else with the code from entering.
- Entry door gets stuck halfway open and bathroom door struggles to close.
- Shower door leaks water out onto the floor.
- No ice machine anywhere on the premises.
- Tv remote had issues with volume controls not working half of the time. We literally had to unplug the tv twice to get them to work again.
Still a good value but hope to see some repairs in the future."

The entire hotel smelled thick of mildew. Everything was damp. Maybe that’s just because of the location and being so close to the water? Idk but it was overwhelming. The hotel itself tho is very unique. It was clean. Towels and sheets are self serve. No one brings you more. The hosts however were super friendly, checked in consistently and were super helpful. Wouldn’t bring the family here but a cute place for a couple."

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at this Airbnb met our expectations, offering the convenience and comfort typically found in a hotel room. We felt safe throughout our stay, which was a major plus. One of the highlights was definitely the rooftop area, where we enjoyed great views of Miami. It provided a perfect spot for relaxation and taking in the scenery.
The location was good – nestled in a relatively peaceful part of mid-beach, while still granting easy access to the vibrant South Beach area, which is just a short stroll or Uber ride away. Additionally, the beach was incredibly close, requiring no more than a 5-minute walk to reach the sand. This made our beach outings effortless and frequent.
Overall, our stay was great, thanks to the excellent location and responsive hosts."

The hosts were very friendly, communicative, and proactive in making sure we had everything we needed (special shoutout to Bianca who assisted us throughout our stay).
The place is located in the Mid-Beach area so it is far enough away from the chaos of the South Beach area but close enough to get to popular restaurants and bars. There are convenient cafes nearby and Bon Bouquet Cafe is located in the lobby of the building (it just launched on the day we were leaving so we didn't get a chance to try it but it is super convenient for anyone staying here for a quick breakfast/brunch). While there is no direct beach access connected to the property, the beach is easily accessible right across the street. Overall it was a great stay and highly recommended!"

Stayed a few nights","Pros:
- Just 2 min walking distance to bus which will take you to downtown Miami in 30 minutes
- Responsive host. Easy check-in and check-out
- Great neighborhood close to many restaurants and shops
- Proximity to Miami Beach
Cons:
- Small apartment for 2 people. Not viable if there are 2 people with one more kid.
- Biggest problem being walls are not soundproof. One can hear neighbors talking even at regular conversations. For all 4 nights I spent, the neighbors angrily banged the wall and even screamed at us even though we were talking at regular voice level. This was very unsafe. Not suitable for family.
- I stayed for 4 nights, if we request for cleaning, then there is an extra $30 fee per cleaning. The billed $69 cleaning fee is only for one-time before check-in. So it’s a problem for longer stays where we need to pay extra for cleaning.
- Not enough towels and soaps provided in the room. Need to explicitly request for it. But yes, they did provided quickly on request."

It’s only a couple miles from south beach and right across the street from the beach. If you are here for a few days, just Uber because parking is some blocks away. The manager is very responsive and will check in with you on how your liking the air BNB."

Stayed over a week",Great value! I stayed at the Venezia for 22-days and it was a good experience. I would highly recommend them for extended stays of experienced travelers. The value is really great and I felt like they went they extra mile to check in and make sure everything was OK with my stay. The rooftop lounge is a hidden gem and an amenity I came to appreciate a lot more over time. The rooms are comparable to a 3-3.5 star hotel (similiar to a Cambria). The location is perfect. The Venezia ultimately checked a lot more boxes than I expected when I booked my stay - book with confidence. The one critical thing I would mention is if you have sensitive allergies you might want to test out the viability of your stay first as this building is an older building (with a quality face lift) on the canal.

Felt safe even as a 20 year old girl."

The airconditioning installation might be loud in some rooms though.
Good location, far enough from clubs etc to let you sleep, but close enough to reach it with free buses (15mins) leaving from the stop 50m from the hotel or take a long walk (1h).
Good stay!"

Stayed one night","Overall, the staff (Nancy at the front desk) was super friendly and very accommodating. Great location. Was able to walk to the beach and dinner; I also enjoyed sitting on the rooftop to read. The only issue I had was the smell of mildew and mold that was visible on the ceiling of my bathroom and it was very humid/muggy in the room. The air conditioning never really shut off so it was always running. And then there were the not so friendly guests that were also staying at the time that I came in contact with… but the price was decent so I can’t complain too much."

I appreciate the fact that the apartment was well priced and there were no additional payments on checking in as I had with my previous encounters in Miami. It’s in a strategic location - a two minute walk from the beach and great restaurants for fine dining. The views from the rooftop are breathtaking and the ambiance of the entire building is an amazing sight. Definitely would recommend it for anyone looking for a convenient short/long stay for you and your partner while in Miami.

Stayed a few nights","My best friend and I had a great time during our stay. Check-in was flexible (we ultimately arrived earlier than anticipated) and the host was responsive. When we got to our room, we noticed something that did not meet our expectations, and after we brought it to the attention of management, we were able to quickly change rooms and even had an upgraded room. Everyday the host checked in on us in the morning to see if we needed anything which was so nice and helpful. We were also able to get fresh towels easily. The location is great because there is a cafe/convenience store nearby if you need anything and Ubers/Lyfts are affordable. Also during our stay there were contractors looking to make improvements so the building has nice amenities and upgrades. Our bed was also super comfortable. Would recommend for anyone looking for an affordable place for a quick getaway in Miami!"
