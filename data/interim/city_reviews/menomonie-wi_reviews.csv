Stayed one night","This apartment was lovely. The space was larger enough for the 3 of us to spread out. The kitchen was well-stocked and had everything you might need to prepare a meal.
The area around was stunning. It was private and green and we spotted a deer coming out of the forest. The location and grounds were perfect for relaxing.
Everything was great! The only mention I will make is about the very steep steps to enter the unit. We are all physically able but that may be a big challenge for someone with mobility issues."

Stayed a few nights","Beautifully maintained apartment above the shed. The place has a homey hand-built feel and is much larger than I was expecting! The shed is located right on the edge of a pristine woodland that I assume is loaded with deer and other wildlife. If there hadn't been a snowstorm that weekend I would love to have spent lots of time walking around in the forest. Carolyn and Herb were friendly and good communicators that respected my privacy during my stay. I was a little surprised that there was no TV in such a complete apartment, but that actually worked well for my purposes this trip. There are puzzles and games and it would be a terrific retreat for a young family. Thank you for the great stay!"

Stayed one night","The property is in a very peaceful and scenic location, I arrived just before sunset and it was magic! The apartment itself is bigger than I expected, very tastefully arranged and decorated, and most importantly there is ample space for guests' belongings (rare in my experience)! It was a very comforting place to land, after a day of driving; the kitchen has all the tools and accessories to prepare and enjoy a meal, quality cotton bed linens, and a sweet balcony to enjoy your morning coffee and watch the sunrise. I highly recommend a stay here and do hope to visit again sometime!"

The owner lives in the house in front of the garage apartment, but they aren't a problem. I saw him outside a couple times and had a friendly chat each time. This is a super affordable place and very nice place to stay."

Everything is well labeled so you know exactly where to go and even the little qurks were labeled so you didn't have to guess. Puzzles and games for the kids to play were a great plus. My son was excited that the edge pieces were already separated for him. :) definitely a wonderful place to stay. Look forward to staying again in the summer.

There was a bowl for dog water and a few other things that were great to have on hand. The apartment is big and very comfortable. I appreciate being able to have my dogs along. It's above the bar and near the road; I liked the sound of music and people out at night. It was a great weekend; we easily could have stayed longer. Thank you Abbey!"

Having 2 full bathrooms made getting ready in the mornings easier. We really enjoyed the record player and being able to relax in the atrium on the hammocks. We don't smoke, but you couldn't even smell smoke so we loved being able to enjoy that space too!!! Thanks for sharing your place, we will be back!!!"

The kitchen and living room are perfect for hanging out. The master bedroom has a huge bathroom and beautiful lake view. The other 2 bedrooms down the hall share a bathroom with double sink so there’s plenty of room. The 4 season room is an oasis of plants and natural light.
The location is perfect for walking to campus, restaurants and bars. We loved having The Abbey right downstairs. Our host Abbey was very responsive and so easy to communicate with. There’s nothing I would change. We can’t wait to stay here again!"

Stayed with a pet","It’s hard to describe this amazing in-town apartment. The pictures and reviews do not do it justice. It is nothing short of magical , especially when you transition from the barely finished stairwell hallway into what turns out to be a spacious uniquely decorated artsy home. Kind of a step into something out of Architectural Digest, or an art gallery with a skylit hammocked interior courtyard. Wow! You’ll just have to experience it, and we recommend you do! The kitchen is large and well-equipped, as are the bathrooms. The front view of the water is fabulous . The beds are very comfortable. Abby is very responsive and helpful."

Turned out that I didn't actually stay there (long story) but my daughters did, and they enjoyed it very much. They especially loved the wide open spaces, both inside and out. And of course the cleanliness, always a plus. Would definitely recommend this spot!"

The kitchen was well stocked and bathrooms had plenty of towels. Both bedrooms had room darkening curtains and comfy beds. The house is a duplex and in the country. Our favorite part of the property was the deck. The views were beautiful . This property does have a split entry which you can see in the photos. If anyone in your group has mobility challenges this maybe an issue. We enjoyed our stay and I wouldn’t hesitate to reserve this property again.

The only downside of my stay was the windows sweating when it was extremely cold out. I had never experienced that before. Jessica & Ryan quickly provided fans to help alleviate the issue. They also made sure snow was cleared in a timely manner from the driveway. I would definitely return for a future stay if the opportunity arose.
P.S. The gas fireplace is awesome. My favorite part of my stay. 😊"

Stayed a few nights","I wanted a place a little out of the way but close to everywhere that I need to go and this was exactly what I got. I was by myself, but it could easily accommodate a family of 4, and I really recommend this for any guest group from 1-4 people. I really enjoyed being in nature, but I also wanted to have the ability to just ""cocoon"" and relax in the evenings inside. This place was really private which I don't necessarily need, but it was definitely a perk and a preference. The place was wonderfully decorated enough, but not too overwhelming. It really felt hospitable and welcoming which is what I want from an AirBnb. Next time I'm in the general area, I'm hopeful this place is available so that I can stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","This is the second time we have stayed here and we love it! Chris and Theresa make sure you get the instructions to get in and the place is spotless! They have so many extra little things that make it that much more to stay - variety of snacks, little bottles of wine, coffee, individual cereal boxes, and even little pitchers of milk for the cereal! Even though the apartment is above a garage, the garage door isn't loud and won't bother you if they use it. I highly recommend this place if your staying in the Menomonie area. They could get away with charging more for this gem (not that I want them to)!"

The only thing to consider is that the wifi is only strong enough to do extremely basic tasks and was unreliable. If you need to make video calls or upload files etc, you will need to go to a coffee shop down the road.

Stayed one night","Ten out of five stars if I could! This place was adorable, surrounded by lovely and beautiful woods. I could’ve spent days here exploring and just relaxing in this serene little escape. The first night we saw the cutest little owl right outside the patio door sitting in a tree. At first we thought he was fake, until he turned his head and winked at us!
Terri was extremely accommodating and communicative. She made us feel so welcome, even including snacks, cereal, coffee, creamer and sugar, mini wines, and a couple of beers! The bed was super comfortable, and the natural light from the skylights made everything feel even more lovely. The art and unique touches in the studio were fascinating, and we felt immediately at home. Exceptionally positive vibes here in this sweet, quaint space💕
Instructions for check in and check out were clear, and we already booked another visit in April:) Thank you!"

Everything was beautiful and immaculate, thoughtfully supplied and with clear directions/instructions if needed. The feeling of rest and peace, with beautiful light streaming through multiple, private windows indeed explains why this space worked so well originally as an art studio. It made me want to come back again and use it as a writing studio! In addition, it's close enough to the lovely town of Menomonie to easily slip in for shopping or restaurants. A real gem."

Tastefully decorated, it makes clever use of the space available. The window wall in the living room faces the forest behind the property which is a great touch. There is also a small back porch prefect for coffee in the morning. The apartment was spotlessly clean and the hosts left us a thoughtful welcome gift. The apartment is located on the outskirts of Menominee and is convenient to both the city and the trails in the area. The hosts even provide a trail pass. It is quiet, comfortable and relaxing. Be aware that this studio has minimal cooking equipment - no stove or oven. However, I did cook two meals there. Highly recommended."

Stayed a few nights","We have grown to love Menomonie and have stayed often. But this was our first time at Chris and Theresa’s. It was perfect for us. An open loft welcomed us, full of windows and light, with birch and deer out the windows. We lucked out with the January weather and were able to be comfortable out on the nearby Red Cedar River Trail. We prepared some of our meals in the well equipped kitchen and slept soundly on the comfy bed. Many thoughtful touches conveyed hospitality and care. Very quiet and private, which we loved. About 10 minutes from downtown Menomonie. We hope to return soon since it is just over an hour from home."

Stayed a few nights","We've stayed at a few Airbnb's but Chris and Theresa have set the bar at a new level for what our expectations will be in the future for other Airbnb's we stay at. The place was exceptionally clean, was exactly as described and included some unexpected bonuses such as a large snack basket, some beer and wine, half and half for our coffee, cereal and milk for breakfast along with a super bright flashlight and an umbrella. The entire place was decorated very nicely and included some small but important features like a hook right outside the shower for your towel and a nicely organized book with restaurant and attraction options. The view out the family room window is awesome and you feel like you are in the middle of the woods. This is a very secluded place in the country but close to downtown Menomonie and the Red Cedar bike trail. If you're looking for a place to relax and enjoy the local area at a fair price this is the place to stay. You won't be disappointed."

It was immaculately clean, very spacious, beautifully decorated and equipped with everything you could possibly need, as well as the very thoughtful extra touches that made our stay exceptional. There was a special welcoming gift waiting for my husband and me (we were celebrating our anniversary), a very well stocked kitchen with snacks and breakfast items provided, a fabulous king sized bed with skylights overhead and a charming deck with two chairs - just right for our morning tea and coffee amidst the colorful trees.
This wonderful studio is very private, as it is above their extra large detached garage. It also has its own entrance which does not go through the garage, and parking is very convenient.
We had scenic views of the countryside and woods from the many windows, skylights and deck that this apartment offered.
We highly recommend our hosts, Chris and Theresa, as well as their amazing studio apartment to anyone visiting this part of Wisconsin. We truly hope to return some time soon."

Lucette Brewing has delicious wood-fired pizza and is only a few miles down the scenic Cedar River Trail. We took Theresa's suggestion and ate at Jake's Supper Club- excellent food and good service. If you are a cheese lover, the rosemary gouda at Cady Cheese Factory & Shop is yummy. We shared it with family and they loved it too.

My (tiny) complaint is that the futon was covered in some animal hair. I found a lint roller in a closet and cleaned it up, but still, that would be pretty inconvenient to people with allergies. Anyhoo, otherwise things were clean and just great.

We came to visit a sister in Menominie who is in a nursing facility and they allowed us to have meals, play games, and visit inside and outside of their beautiful home with as many as five family members at a time. We will always remember how welcomed we felt and how wonderful it was to have yummy homemade coffee cake, juice, and fresh ground coffee and water bottles set out for us each morning. We can’t wait to book this home again next year!"

She had a lovely breakfast laid out for us in the morning with some AMAZING homemade blueberry coffee cake. It was a unique experience staying in an earthen home, and we had fun taking a walk, with permission, on the roof! I highly recommend this Airbnb experience to anyone looking to stay in the area."

The common areas (kitchen, dining room, living room) added to our ability to move around and stretch out. The full size refrigerator also meant we could grocery shop and did not have to eat every meal out. Be aware the home is in the countryside so you’ll have to drive 10 minutes or so to get to “civilization “ and cellphone reception can be poor. But the scenery is great and all the small surrounding towns were friendly with lots of fun restaurants and wineries. I highly recommend Barb and Don’s home."

Stayed a few nights","The earth-sheltered “Hobbit” home is in a beautifully landscaped setting amid the very picturesque Wisconsin farm country of my youth. Quiet and spacious accommodations in a wonderfully relaxed atmosphere were the perfect retreat for me from a crowded family reunion location. Barb and Don are kind and thoughtful hosts, and wonderful conversationalists. Barb’s coffee cake is to die for(!!) and not to be missed. The bed was very comfortable with what felt like a new mattress, and made up with silky, high thread count sheets. Everything was spotless yet unfussy and comfortingly homey. I was made to feel right at home myself, too. Welcomed to come and go as I wished and I only wish I’d had more time to explore the lovely, flower-filled yard. The vaulted ceiling architecture and enormous dimensions of the kitchen and entryway provided ample ventilation for our times. Fluffy towels and plenty of them, a space for hanging clothes in their own closet, and ample surfaces for luggage made it very easy to quickly unpack and have all my things easy to find—no need to live from my suitcases. Such clean, comfortable and quiet accommodations at such a reasonable price beat any hotel. I won’t hesitate to stay here again should the opportunity present itself!"

The space is incredibly clean, Barb and Don are super nice, and the home is nearby enough to do lots of things in Menomonie while still being out in the country enough to enjoy stretching views and stunning sunsets.

Their inground home was an interesting design and decorated in a stylish and inviting way."

Stayed one night","Barb & Don's Hobbit Home is wonderful. Everything was as nice (or nicer!) than a luxury hotell, scrupulously clean, delightfully decorated, and very welcoming.
This is a private room with a cute little loft space and a bath across the hall, in a separate hallway from the owner's own bed & bath space. The bed was amazingly comfortable, the bathroom full of clean towels and cozy warmth.
We were made to feel very welcome in the living/dining/kitchen/entry area. We arrived quite late in the evening, and the hosts left us a homemade breakfast in the morning.
The highway is quite close but traffic was minimal during the night and it didn't disturb us at all. The cell service is quite weak inside the house, but Barb & Don gave us the wifi password. (We had trouble with the wifi, but I'm confident they would have been able to fix it for us had we asked before we went to bed!)
Our preference is for entirely separate spaces, and yet we fully intend to stay at the Hobbit Home again if we get the chance!"

Some of the Airbnbs say you have access to the kitchen and then it turns out you really don’t. But here we felt comfortable using the kitchen. We really hope we can stay again.

Staying in a hobbit house was fun and once inside could not tell it was built into a hill. The high ceilings and natural light add to the comfort of the home.
We were served home made coffee cake fresh from the oven and i was highly impressed that it was gluten free so i was able to enjoy it was well.
We are looking forward to stay there again."

We kicked our feet up in the cozy sitting area in front of a huge window while reading in the sunshine and watched the birds outside on the feeders. The common area also has a fun game table that we used for work and play.
Our son loved the loft for doing his homework and for sleeping. Our bed was super comfy.
Barb and Don made a delicious breakfast of blueberry muffins, fresh pineapple, coffee, and juice. They were great hosts, and we enjoyed getting to talk with them.
The unique architecture of the earth home-hobbit house added to the excellent experience."

The primary bed is very comfortable. Climbing a straight up ladder into the very low ceiling loft was a challenge for 6'3"" grandson and the sleeping was ok. It was very reasonable in price and the hosts welcomed us into the entire living and kitchen areas. I would easily go there again. Thanks."

Stayed one night","We enjoyed a lovely stay at this welcoming and unique home. We were given helpful directions, a tour of the house, and were offered cookies and conversation. The bathroom and bedroom were cute, cozy, and clean. LOVE the lofted bed, so fun. Very nice to get to know Barb and Don, they were so hospitable. We even enjoyed the much appreciated homemade blueberry coffee cake in the morning. A must-stay for anyone in WI."

Stayed a few nights",The daughter and grand-daughter (who were at the house while the hosts were out of town) were just delightful. We loved the rural setting. Very peaceful. The house is surrounded by fields that were being harvested and the trees of the surrounding countryside were spectacular with fall color. We enjoyed a fire on the outdoor brick patio. The house was quaint and well-maintained. The coffee cake was amazing!! We would definitely stay at the Hobbit House again.

Stayed one night","Barb and Don have such a cute, wonderful home! The room was clean, just the right size, and had an awesome loft! When we woke up, Barb had made us coffee cake, gave us coffee, and grapes. Barb and Don were also extremely understanding and flexible regarding our check in and out time. We got a flat tire on the way up to Wisconsin and so didn't arrive to their place until 2am. Barb was so nice making sure that we were comfortable and all settled in. The next day, she gave us a ride to Eau Claire so we could get an update on our vehicle and made sure we were able to continue our trip before leaving. I would recommend this Airbnb to anyone and everyone!"

The hosts are so welcoming and warm and went above and beyond to make sure we felt at home. Each morning coffee was made and ready for us and breakfast was provided. It was a true bed and breakfast experience! Barb and Don are two of the nicest individuals and created a balance where they would give us our own space but also interacted with us and made sure we had everything we needed. The house is so comfortable and true to the description and photos. My friends and I were in town for a festival in Eau Claire and the location is only about 20 minutes from the town. I highly recommend staying at their home.

The town is not a bustling metropolis of nightlife but it's quaint with a great train museum, antique shop, and a couple of bars.
Once we all arrived we never left the cabin and had a great time with plenty of space inside and out to be separate when needed but together when we wanted.
The neighbors are super nice too."

The location was perfect, just steps away from the lake(literally) and only 10 min from the downtown buzz of Menomonie. The cabin was beautifully decorated and very clean.

There's a dock for guests use, we rented a pontoon from a local recommended by Greg and used the dock to tie the pontoon. The place was exceptionally stocked with kitchen stuff and enough towels and linens for 8 people. The host was very responsive and friendly. We had requested for an extended late check out which agreed instantly. More importantly this place is very affordable and close to twin cities. The lake which I mentioned earlier is a pretty large one so we had real fun in and out the house. We already started to look for dates to come back. Highly highly recommended."

I really think that the pictures don't do the place justice. I felt like it was nicer in person and very cozy! We enjoyed eating at Jake's Super Club. Everyone at Pioneer Grill was super nice and made you feel like a regular local person. Elk Point Resort was also nice. We didn't order the fish but it looked really good.

We chose this location because we were excited to use the kayaks at the dock, but found that the lake was too smelly for us to stomach paddling in, and there was some other difficulties with using the kayaks themselves.
We ended up hanging out on the deck up by the cabin and just enjoying the quiet afternoons here. If you are a birder, this is a great location. We had a lot of beautiful bald eagle sightings.
There's some fun bars nearby if you want to eat out, and a cheese factory if you want to bring home some curds!
We had a relaxing stay."

Stayed with kids","Pictures and description are accurate. Was really nice having two bathrooms on the main floor. The place was spotless. Greg connected us with a pontoon rental from another resident on the lake. (We ended up communicating with the pontoon rental guy through Facebook marketplace- just type in “pontoons for rent on Tainter Lake.” The rates were extremely reasonable. We were able to keep the pontoon right on Greg’s dock. The water was pretty green so we took the kids to a sandbar with the pontoon, where the water was clearer. There are a handful of bars on the lake where you can drive up your pontoon. The cabin and pontoon made for the PERFECT vacation."

Stayed a few nights","What a truly special space. Came here with my girlfriends for a birthday weekend getaway and wow were we blown away. To start, the view of the lake is absolutely beautiful. We spent almost an entire day sitting on the deck and admiring the view in the sunshine. The cabin itself is lovely, spacious, and welcoming. We watched plenty of movies cuddled up on the couches at night. Plenty of bed and couch space for larger groups (we only had 4). The fire pit area is lovely and there is plenty of extra wood to split if you do not bring your own. The neighbors are extremely nice and there were a few extremely sweet neighborhood dogs that hung around and said hello. Menomonie is about a 10 minute drive for anything you need during your stay, and the place is well-stocked with soap, laundry detergent, cleaning products, etc etc. One of my friends even took one of the kayaks out on the lake for a while! Overall, a very welcoming space with amazing energy and at an extremely reasonable price. Everything was wonderful."

Stayed with kids","Greg’s place is great! Wonderful cabin-feel to it. Sits high in Lake Tainter with great views of the lake. Heads up that the lake turns pretty green for about two months in the late summer (some locals told me), and our end of the lake had a pretty strong smell to it. But, it wouldn’t stop us from visiting again! The fishing was good, as the green layer only goes down an inch or two - below that is clear for the fish to see bait. If you enjoy fishing, be sure to hit up Bait On Broadway in Menomonie (about ten minutes away). Great bait shop with super cool owners - who know all the good spots and were very hospitable!
Gregs place had everything we needed. Stocked bathrooms, kitchen, Netflix, a beautiful deck. We loved it!"

In these COVID time cleanliness is super important but in addition we had an infant so it was all too important for us. We couldn't be happier with the way the place was cleaned and organized. Due to the proximity to lake, always expect flies and small bugs around the place so remember to keep the deck door closed as much as possible. The lake is ~70 steps down from the deck, just FYI :) The sunset over the lake was breathtaking as well as the Fall colors in the area. I would love to come back next time."

We did notice a bug problem in the kitchen, particular when there was no lights on, but they tended to scamper quickly and I'm assuming they were inside to escape the temp change outside.
Overall, I recommend Greg's place. It was charming, cozy and a great place."

We loved watching the birds at the feeders and the bald eagles flying right overhead and it was fun for our city-kids to see the sky full of stars. The kitchen had everything we needed for our family of 6 eating three meals a day. We had trouble with the plumbing in the shower one evening and the owners immediately responded and sent out a plumber the next morning to take care of it. We would love to come back.

Group trip","On top of a small hill overlooking frozen lake ( you can ice fish if you’d like ) or just drive on the frozen lake if you haven’t tried it as we did it :)
Clean spacious house with everything you need to feel comfortable and relaxed. Some nice board games too ( we brought our own but some of Greg’s were new to us )
Overall highly recommending this place."

The house was just perfect for our group. The kitchen is very well stocked with pots and pans and many utensils for cooking. Greg has plenty of coffee, pasta, canned food and lots of other food in the house in case you arrive late in the evening.
The auto checkin is convenient.
There are plenty of towels and the beds are comfortable.
We will definitely return!"

Stayed with kids","My husband and I stayed here with our crawling 9 month old. It was fabulous! With a few minor adjustments, the house was baby proof. The view off of the deck is amazing, and the weather was lovely so we spent lots of our time out there. There were lots of steps down to the lake and no access for swimming. We did try to fish, which was fun even if we didn’t catch anything. We loved the availability of DirectTV (we don’t have cable at our house so this was a luxury!) and lots of board games. The location felt in the middle of nowhere, but was only a 15 minute drive to town. We would highly recommend this place!!"

This was nothing like hotels or motels it was private and affordable. I showed pictures to my family and friends they was so amazed and said they would have to definately agree with wanting to come back to the cabin.

Group trip","We stayed in Greg's cabin during a visit to family over the holidays, and it was the perfect home base for our vacation. Since I had not visited in the winter for several years (and my sons never had), I was concerned about the cold--Greg made sure the heat was on and ready for us when we checked in, and also sent a message halfway through our stay to make sure everything was going well. The cabin was well appointed and very comfortable for our family of 5. It's a nice quiet spot, and the view of the lake from the house was lovely--it was too cold to do much outside (for us Texans, anyway), so we appreciated the board games and books when we were relaxing between visits to various relatives. I'm sure it's even better in the summer!"

A very comfortable kitchen/living area was the hub of our stay, with soft couches and blankets to stay cozy around the fireplace as the snow fell outside! The view of the lake is awesome and we hope to return when it's warmer to enjoy it more.
The parking area is on the opposite side of the house from the entrance, so if arriving in the winter months, be prepared to have to walk through the snow. This was not an issue, but was a little confusing as we initially arrived when it was dark outside.
The space was very clean and we were able to find everything we needed easily. We also loved the artwork around the house!"

Stayed a few nights","My two day 'retreat' at Third Mountain was ideal to find focus from my busy Twin Cities urban life. I needed to work remotely, think and write and have strong WiFi for client calls. The Farmhouse - dining room table, salon and even the kitchen table - provided amazing support for this new creative energy. Nature, including green spaces and bird song, drew a literal landscape of relaxation and centeredness. And I slept great, which rarely happens.
Host Andrea created a wonderful home-away-from-home, within an hour's drive of St. Paul. She was very responsive to all my questions so I had the supplies I needed to have a productive professional 'retreat. I can't wait to return this summer!"

The beds and pillows were very comfortable compared to most AirBnBs or hotels, but the sheets were the cheaper microfiber sheets and the fitted sheet popped of the bed multiple times over the two nights. Most of the place was very clean, but the bathroom could have used a better cleaning. I contacted the host and he apologized and set he is usually the one to clean it, but someone else had cleaned if for him after the last guest. I am guessing the hosts may not have been inside since it was cleaned after the last guest. It is a thoughtful touch that they leave some snacks/breakfast items for their guests, but a couple of the items were a week or more past their ""use by"" dates."

Stayed one night","Along a mundane street in a normal small-city neighborhood there is hidden tree-lined lane that leads you to a lovely ridge where upon sits Clint & Nora’s farm. Now these are a farm and cabin in the same sense that a Tiffany lamp is a light and shade. Beautiful, graciously designed, and soul-soothing are good descriptors of the vistas, the cabin, the barn, and yes, even the barnyard. It’s a lively spot with exuberant dogs, sleek horses, and happy-to-meet-you donkeys. Friendly and thoughtful hosts, lovely surroundings - you always remember this sweet little corner of Menomonie!"

The space was comfy and spotless and they even gave us enough stuff in the fridge for four days of breakfasts. We had a severe thunderstorm during our stay, and they were kind enough to check in on us. We definitely would love to visit again!"

The host was extremely responsive for the few times I had to reach out to him. If you’re considering the cottage, do yourself a favor and book it. You will not be disappointed!"

The 1 bedroom cottage has a full kitchen, dining table, comfy living room with tv and fireplace, 3/4 bath and comfy queen bed in a separate bedroom. The large bedroom window is a great view of a horse and two donkeys who provide a charming natural alarm in the morning. The front room window overlooks the beautiful red barns, the chickens and if you look closely you can see a few cats. Everything is beautifully cared for and decorated for the season. Checkin was easy and Clint is available to answer any questions or resolve any issues. We initiated and enjoyed a morning chat to learn more about his spot and to meet his youngest daughter. All in all the two day stay was perfect and highly recommended."

I truly cannot say enough good things about this place!"

After our race, we came back and relaxed on the couches by the fire place. We enjoyed looking out the big front window at the beautifully landscaped farm and animals. It was so cozy! The kitchen was awesome for cooking, the bed was super comfy, and eveverything was so nice and clean. We would stay again for sure!"

It's a beautiful farm, convenient location to downtown/ UW-Stout. Comfortable and warm. The host was super nice and accommodating, and left food + coffee out for me in the kitchen which was super helpful since I arrived mid-day after an early morning flight and was heading to a meeting at the university. Def recommended! There are 2 Lyft drivers in town who are also SUPER nice."

Stayed a few nights","This airbnb home was perfect for us. It had everything we needed , including a washer and dryer and an electric fire place. The location is idyllic on top of a hill on the property of the cutest Wisconsin farm surrounded by horses, donkeys, dogs and cattle and within the city limits.
It was very clean and had excellent air quality. The mattress was on the softer side, but it appeared that one could remove the topper to have it firmer.
Plenty of drawer space was an extra bonus.
The refrigerator was stocked full of amenities, fresh fruit and breakfast items and our host was quick to respond to anything we needed extra.
We certainly will return.
Thank you!"

Stayed a few nights","Where to start? We are already trying to find excuses to go back to Menomonie again just so we can stay with Clint and Nora! From the minute Clint met us at the door to our place with shovel in hand (they were getting another 6"" of snow when we arrived!) to the treats left for us in the fridge, we felt so at home in the guest house. It was warm, cozy, and so very clean. The bed was extremely comfortable and the whole house just felt like home away from home. The location was perfect for us (close to our event in town) but still gave you that feeling that you were well out into the country surrounded by beautiful farmland. Even the family dogs were there to greet us and say goodbye as we came and went from our place. Clint was also very responsive to all of our questions and even though we were pretty self-sufficient, I felt assured that Clint and Nora would have been there for us. We have stayed at many BnB properties, and this one ranks right up at the top for us."

Stayed with kids","Exceeded our expectations.
The cabin is charming, cozy, clean, and comfortable. It is built right on the waters edge. The wrap around deck offers beautiful views of the bay on Tainter Lake. Feels like a private retreat.
The dock was in great condition with Adirondack chairs to sit, relax and enjoy the peaceful view. A bonus - we threw in fishing lines and caught bass right off the dock.
The lake was very quiet - aka peaceful. Caveat, we stayed in September, not the summer months.
The beds were both very comfortable which is very important to us. There was a view of the lake from the master bedroom looking out sliding glass doors. Bonus!
The kitchen is large with everything (cooking utensils) you would need to cook if you choose to do so.
They have a game cabinet in the living room filled with a wide variety of games. We spent the evening playing games we had not played in many years. It was wonderful."

The cabin is very nicely decorated with lots of kitschy Wisconsin touches. You can sit on the deck and watch birds in the massive tree that overhangs the porch. Jake's Supper Club is a great nearby option for dinner. Robb is a lovely host and even though he lives on the property in the main house up above, you still feel like you have lots of privacy. When were surprised to get homemade cookies, fresh sourdough bread, and a bottle of local wine when we arrived. Highly recommend. We will definitely be back.

We are 60 years old and had no problem, but I wouldn't want to navigate them with a child or any leg/ ankle injury. This was probably the only thing that I would want to warn anyone about.

Looks good on the surface but things need to be addressed. 2 stove burners didn't work, most of the wooden stools are coming apart and 1 we didn't trust to sit on. 1 kitchen blind was broken and 1 missing a panel. Grill had mold growing inside..eewww and the hot tub needs to be cleaned, maybe water changed. It gave off a scent of sunscreen and sweat. Biggest let down was the jacuzzi tub not working, maybe we missed that note somewhere. Oh, and sitting on the couch made my allergies go nuts. I was fine everywhere else, just not on the couch. If you plan on using the Keurig you'd better like French Roast and only that. And that occasional knocking sound? I think it's a Pex water line in the ceiling that's not secured so it bangs against the sheetrock.
It's a cure little place but it's gotten some water and tear. Maybe the group before us was partying hard, maybe the caretaker isn't paying close attention. A for concept, C- for execution."

Couch inside is comfy and record player was a fun touch- lots of games to choose from too! Having hot chocolate, popcorn and coffee on hand for us to enjoy were great amenities as well. Grill could have used some cleaning, but everything else was spotless with a good abundance of both indoor and outdoor towels. Having bug spray provided was a really great perk. Prompt responses to a few questions I had during our stay made me feel taken care of.. Nice place!"

A few things to note: the river is pretty to look at from a distance, but not a great dock to sit on. The sleeping arrangements are one bedroom and then a large area, so if your group will need to be able to spread out and have privacy, it might not be a great option. Overall, wonderful!"

A lovely view of the water from the back of the home. And, on a personal note, since my husband and I had recently divorced but both wanted to spend time with our son, having one bedroom in the main house and one bedroom over the garage was ideal. Plenty of private space for the two of us adults to each have, separately, plus a great loft for our three kids to sleep in and a common area for all of us to hang out. Lots of outdoor seating as well, plus a delightful hammock and hot tub for more relaxation. A great investment."

It was a bit difficult to find as we realized the address took you to a different spot depending on what app you use. However, follow the directions listed by the host and you will be just fine!
Host was EXTREMELY helpful and so kind to us leading up to our trip. We did not worry about a single thing as Heidi was proactive in communicating - even sending out an extra list of amenities so we didn’t have to guess as to what to pack!
The separate apartment area is perfect to give a special place away from the main house.
BOOK HERE! You will not be disappointed!"

It was very clean and lots of amenities. Directions were very clear. The extra room above the garage smelled strong of moth balls.

The place is impeccably kept, clean, cozy and has anything you could think to need- including a hot tub with a view! Our questions before and during the stay were answered very quickly. The apartment above the garage was as well appointed as the rest of the place, including a kitchenette, bathroom with shower, and tv! Just make sure to note that it is not connected to the rest of the cabin- just a couple steps outside, which is really no big deal, unless you don’t like being alone/separated! It did end up being a little chilly in there, and when we asked about the thermostat the property caretaker popped over within an hour to check it out and bring a space heater, just in case. It was a great stay and we highly recommend this place for a cozy winter weekend, or longer!"

Whether you are staying by yourself, family, a business retreat or writing a book where peace and quiet are necessary.....this Airbnb requires stars that go above and beyond a 5 star rating. Heidi and Tom have made this a place of refuge away from the hustle and bustle of life. The Christmas Tree....lights on the banister and lit deers in the yard....it is a place of special feelings and emotions that rush in its serenity. I will return many times to this special place. I give it a rating of 10 out of a possible 5. Oh! Wait! I forgot to mention the whirlpool that feels just right while sipping a beverage....... Michael"

Only thing we were disappointed about was that in the listing photos, there was a close-up photo of a kitchen drawer full of snacks, but all we could find was a lonely pk of micro popcorn. Since they included the image of snacks, we anticipated them being there so we didn't stop and grab any on our way, and we already got there pretty late at night.

I enjoyed a morning cup of coffee at the kitchen table while a sweet little deer just outside the patio doors and I stared each other down - how special!! The river was beautiful as well and we enjoyed hearing the activity of passing boats, and later just listening to the birds, trees, and water. SO relaxing! Heidi went above and beyond hosting our visit and made sure we had everything we could ever ask for - and more!! From spotlessly clean everything - to those SO-appreciated touches like shampoo, conditioner, shower gel - - and more!!.

It was easily the most well-stocked kitchen area in an AirBnB which made for fun meal-making. We stayed in the cabin the entirety of our time, so if you want a place to suffice without needing to go out and about, this will absolutely do! The cold weather allowed us to enjoy the fire, the many cozy blankets, and the heated floors. Our dogs enjoyed walks through the tree-lined streets, and the humans also enjoyed time surrounded by nature without schedules. Heidi was quick in communication and has included several thoughtful items throughout the house. Of note, the house itself is one bedroom with two beds in a loft area. The third bedroom is not included in the price though is indicated on the listing. If this setup works for your group, don’t hesitate to book this location!"

Our group of ladies really appreciated all of the extra touches. Comfortable mattresses, cozy blankets and pillows, electric blankets, the robes and slippers for the hot tub, I could go on and on. Heidi really thought of everything for a better than home away from home luxury experience. Our group will be back, hopefully in the fall!"

Stayed with a pet","Heidi has thought of everything to make your stay enjoyable at the Chalet. We enjoyed the hot tub every day. I appreciated the robe and the fuzzy flip flops because it was cold out!! She provides toiletries (lotion, shampoo and conditioner)and paper products ( paper towels, etc) for your use. There are plenty of blankets and pillows. The radiant floor heat was super cozy. While there we walked part of the Red Cedar Trail, went to the movie theatre, toured University of Wisconsin Eau Claire, and ate out at the local sushi place. It was a very relaxing spring break. Keep in mind that the futon is quite hard and small, even for our 12 year old. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Luxe Chalet to anyone. It's decorated very tastefully!!!"

Stayed a few nights","This place is a perfect piece of heaven!
We have stayed with Heidi and Tom before 😊
They have put so much thought into every little detail… Once you get settled in this home… You never want to leave. My sister and friends made some wonderful memories… waking up in the morning and looking at the beautiful scenery with a wonderful cup of coffee. Gathering around the large round table perfect for visiting,
Sitting in the hot tub drinking mimosas and feeling the refreshing brisk air.
Sharing the large couch and foot stool watching a movie all snuggled in with soft plush blankets.
The laughter while listening to music on the TV and playing silly games to get to know each other and spend quality time.
Every time I stay at The Luxe I feel more refreshed and balanced.
I’m thankful that Tom and Heidi are sharing their beautiful home. ❤️
I definitely will be back time and time again🥰"

Stayed one night","If you’re on the fence about booking here, just do it. It was amazing. A true oasis. As an interracial couple, this was the least racist little town we’ve ever visited. Really cute shops in town. Make sure to go to the Waterfront Bar & Grill and sit on the deck, the view is amazing. There is nothing bad to say about this place, the only things a little iffy were the beds are kind of stiff and the hot tub top was a struggle to open. Both things that don’t really matter. Don’t come here if you want to swim, I brought a kayak though and the lake was beautiful. Just has a lot of algae. This place is totally worth it. They have this fancy trash can that opens by a motion sensor that blew my mind."

The outdoor space is sizable and the hosts have multiple seating areas set up. The hot tub was a huge plus and the highlight for our kids. The house is well stocked and filled with thoughtful touches and amenities galore. We appreciated the bath bombs, robes, nightlights, k-cups, wagon for loading/unloading, plentiful pillows and blankets, shower products, and multiple power strips! There is lots of attention to detail, it made it so easy to settle right in and start enjoying ourselves. Even our pup was instantly relaxed. The house is an easy drive into Menominee. We enjoyed takeout from Lucette Brewery and highly recommend the farmers market; but honestly it’s tempting to stay put and just enjoy the house."

The river was perfect and serene for the paddle boards we brought, but the river had too much algae this time of year (late summer) for swimming. (The algae is not the hosts' fault at all.) Very short drive to downtown Menomonie and a few walking trails."

There was even condiments and spices provided. The only thing I couldn't find was a strainer for pasta (but Im sure it was there and I missed it because they literally thought of everything!). We even saw 20 wild turkeys in the front yard. You'll love this little slice of heaven!"

Stayed a few nights","Heidi’s directions to the getaway were spot on and The Luxe Chalet was brimming withTLC! Full of thoughtful, beautiful appointments, their home is well furnished with every little thing you might need. We took full advantage of the luxurious hot tub and decided to sleep in the upper loft so we could talk late into the morning hours, each in our own comfy bed. There is plenty of spaces for quiet conversations…it was difficult to decide where to sit…fire pit…porch…hot tub…hammock…or just lounge in the living room listening to music. The large dining room table was utilized to do some creating together, but I can imagine dinners full of laughter as well. A fully equipped kitchen offered the ability to have morning coffee while watching the river laze it’s way by us and then make breakfast using up to date fixtures. We loved how even the laundry was made adorable as the chirping machines informed us their cycles were complete.
Last, but not least, be sure to check out their recommendations from cafes to supper club … if you can bear to tear yourself away from the space; that is.
We are already planning to return to enjoy fall colors, heated floors and a roaring fireplace! Thank you Super Hosts, Heidi and Tom, we are blessed you decided to share your home. We recommend this property to those needing cozy gatherings and romantic getaways. And do it soon before the owners decide THEY should take full advantage of this gem for themselves!"

Heidi and Tom have thought of everything—from a wagon by the front door to assist in carting in your belongings to enough plush robes for an army. The thoughtful touches are endless. And that in floor heating... In this year of no travel (meaning no warm weather vacation to make winter bearable), staying at the chalet was enough to bolster my spirits. Seriously. Looking out at the gorgeous, snow-dusted pines with truly warm feet was restorative. Additionally, this was hands down the best stocked, most functional kitchen I have ever encountered in a rental. I mean, the knives were actually sharp. That never happens. I implore you to stay here. You will not be disappointed."

They shared details about the home and recommendations for other items we may want to bring ourselves. Unfortunately, my wife and I had a personal issue that prevented our stay from occurring, but this is where Heidi & Tom's hospitality really shined through. They were very responsive and incredibly accommodating - they didn't need to be as flexible as they were but my wife and I really appreciated this.

Stayed a few nights","The house is smaller, but it is super cute. The stairs down to the hot tub we're very steep, but manageable for my wife and I who are in our 40s. I would be concerned for anyone with mobility issues getting up and down those stairs. The hot tub was totally worth climbing down the stairs though!
The kitchen was stocked with everything you need to cook food and a nice bonus was that there was a Keurig with plenty of pods available for use.
We were able to log in and watch a movie on the TV in the living room, it was a nice touch that we didn't have to sign into any of our own accounts to watch.
Eating in the dining room with the windows right over the lake made it feel like we were on a houseboat.
Overall, this was a very good experience and we will definitely try to make it back in the future. This is one of the best airbnbs we've ever stayed in."

Stayed with a pet","We were a group of four ladies on a weekend girls trip plus one dog. The cabin was cozy and exactly what we were looking for in a relaxing getaway. The building is right on the lake/river and sitting on the dock was so peaceful! We did not get a chance to try the fire pit out, even though the weather was perfect for it. The kitchen had all the cooking utensils, so you only need to bring food. The place had been cleaned thoroughly before check-in and the hot-tub was prepped for us! Jake's Supper Club is very close and a recommend from our group for lovely dinner out. The four of us were able to manage the space just fine, but felt this location is ideal for 3 people. The stairs have a bit of a tight turn on them to get up to the bedrooms. If your dog is like mine and hates stairs and vinyl plank floors, plan on them hanging out on the main level for your stay. Heidi is a great host. Very friendly and responsive. We would consider staying here again!"

Stayed a few nights","1rst off I want to point out that Heidi is a great host, answers calls & messages right away, very friendly. I misread the instructions on getting the key to unlock the door.I called and she walked me through it and made sure I got it. The house is quite cute but I have to be very honest, it is not for people with any physical impairments. My husband has breathing issues and hip/ back issues. All steps/ stairs in this place are wicked. Especially the ones going down to the lower level where you go out to the dock and where the hot tub is, his main perks of picking this place were for fishing and the hot tub. Photos do not show how steep these steps are. I even messaged about how far it was to fish due to us getting up there in age. Nothing was mentioned about the steps that go to the level to get to the dock. I am in pretty good physical shape and even I had issues with them. I see in other reviews that the house was not clean. It was clean as far as minor but cleaning staff left alot"

Decor and furniture were a little dated and we would have liked something a little more modern, however that may be your style! Privacy was also limited due to neighbors living VERY close and they were always outside. There were limited curtains and some blinds seemed like they would break if we tried to close them. The drains in the bathroom (sink and shower) were extremely slow draining.
Heidi was super responsive and a very kind host! She even let us know while we were out that the internet was out. Overall the stay was pleasant, these are just some items I wish we would’ve knew before booking."

Downtown Menomonie is about a 10 minute drive.

The hot tub right on the river is definitely a highlight!
If you are a person who is not good with stairs, this may not be the right place for you because there are two sets of steep narrow stairs. But if you have good mobility, the three different levels are a cool way to get different perspectives on the river.
It was cold when we were here, but if I come back in the summer, I think all the cute little patios and outdoor chairs would be a wonderful place to hang out.
There are some cute small touches, like a dog bed and water bowl for your furry friends."

Brilliantly, Heidi put a hot tub in this space, and put some cozy lighting and furniture in the area, meaning we could close the door and enjoy the hot tub inside if it was too cold out, or open it and enjoy being in a hot tub right on the river. The house had an interesting build plan, and was one of the most unique places I've stayed. There was a saloon close by where we spent a fair amount of time playing pool and darts, and chatting with the friendly bar tender.
Loved this place. Would absolutely stay again."

The main floor is all tiled, so bring your slippers and be careful not to drop anything. Bring an extra blanket if you like to snuggle on the couch.
Word to the wise: wash your dishes before using. Guests are supposed to clean their own dishes before leaving, but many of the dishes I pulled out to use were covered in coffee stains, some type of oily substance, burnt on food, or otherwise dried food.
Nice ottomans in the living room for extra lounging comfort. A few classic games stocked.
Plenty of soaps, towels, and TP. Great value."

Stayed a few nights","This cabin was a delightful get-away. I needed a quiet place to sit, look at the water, and read a book, and this was the perfect place to do it. The cabin has a funky layout and good character, but this does not distract from the home-like charm. So many places have a sterile, hotel-like blandness to them, but this cabin retains a better character. I found lounging on the couch, sitting on the dock, soaking in the hot tub, and even lingering in bed, to all be incredibly cozy and relaxing. Situated right on the water, the dock is a great place to sit.
In late summer/autumn, the algal blooms in the lake are pretty intense, so no getting in the water. There are a couple of great places to eat an easy walk or short drive away (Jake's Supper Club and Pioneer Grill and Saloon) - the walleye was insanely delicious. Menomonie was a brief drive away for additional food, supply, and entertainment/diversion options.
Heidi was an incredible host. She was incredibly communicative and responsive. Her husband was willing to make the drive to help me out when I had some difficulties, although thankfully I did not end up needing them to put themselves out.
I am so grateful to have stumbled on their listing and to have worked out the opportunity to stay for my little retreat. I sincerely hope I get to again."

Stayed a few nights","This house is too dang cute. It has an interesting layout with a boathouse feel and I was into it! The photos are accurate to the look. I wish we had more time to enjoy the outdoor seating area but the weather was questionable, so we just spent every night in the hot tub (awww - lol). The bed we slept in was comfortable which doesn't always happen at an airbnb. The wifi was fast which is important if your working from here. The location was near Red Cedar State Trail only a few minutes (drive or bike) away which also happens to be next to a brewery with yummy pizza (recommended by Heidi). You're also only an hour from Minneapolis - worth the drive to Minnehaha Falls Park. Heidi was stellar to work with - answered all the questions, gave local tips (fun supper club in walking distance), and made some adjustments to accommodate us which we appreciated greatly. Would recommend and come back again."

The bed was very comfy, and everything felt clean . We traveled to Brewing Projekt , Lucette (great beer and amazing pizza!), and the leinie lodge breweries . Great spot for beer enthusiasts !"

Stayed a few nights",Heidi’s place is beautiful right on the lake! It is very clean and has a secluded feel to it because it is so quiet and relaxing. The hot tub was a great feature it opens out right onto the lake which was so peaceful. The beds were very comfortable. Heidi was very responsive and took care of any needs we had while we were there! I hope to come back again in the summer when there are boats on the lake. Recommend this host and Airbnb to all!!

Suggestions, needs to be more modernized. Less is more. There is a lot of random decor, some a bit odd? It felt very out dated.
We liked the location. Close to town to do some shopping & such."

Group trip","This home is cute, quiet, and private. The home was tidy and the dock on the water was great. Lots of games were available plus a great outdoor couch. The upstairs got very warm during the night so I would recommend fans. The water by the home has a lot of algae this time of year so be careful with pets. Heidi was very responsive when we had questions and provided us K-Cups for the coffee maker!"

Stayed about a week","We loved Heidi's home. The location on the river to the lake was perfect, and the deck right on the water was in constant use by us during our weeks stay, as was the hot tub conveniently located in the boat house area right on the lake too. The area was super quiet, and we barely saw anyone else the whole time we were there, except for the boats going by. It was the perfect space to unwind, and we will surely be back at some point in the future. Well appointed kitchen, amazing fast WiFi, and cable TV. Highly recommended, although be aware that as described the stairs are very steep to the basement/dock area (pretty much a ladder), and the outside walkway down to the dock is very uneven with no handrail, but that certainly didn't detract from our amazing experience. Heidi was super responsive to all our questions as well."

Group trip",Staying at Heidi’s rental was great! The location was beautiful and we had a really nice family weekend. We had 6 people and it never felt crowded. The hot tub got a lot of use and it was really convenient to be able to dock our boat right at the house. Highly recommend this rental and if we are ever back in the area we will definitely book again!!

We appreciated that the kitchen was well stocked with cooking essentials. Definitely check out Jakes Supper Club for great food and drinks. This was the perfect getaway from the city.
