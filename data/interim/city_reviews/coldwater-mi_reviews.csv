It’s a very busy road to cross to get down to the lake so that would be the only downfall. Dawn was a great host!"

Stayed with a pet","I can't say enough about how wonderful this place was for us. We really needed a week to disconnect and unwind. We found it here. The view from. The front porch with morning coffee was serene and beautiful. And at sunset it was just as wonderful.
Dawn was very prompt in communications and very helpful and accommodating. She even offered us the use of a paddle boat that wasn't included with the rental.
We did rent the pontoon for a couple days and it was so nice to be out on the lake. Especially in the evening as the sun set.
I would highly recommend this place for anyone that wants a relaxing stress free vacation."

Stayed over a week","This was my home away from home for two weeks while I teleworked on a big project and visited with my elderly father in the evenings. Clean, cozy, well-equipped and amazing communication. There was always a great breeze off the lake and with the windows all open and ceiling fans it stayed lovely - I ran the living room air conditioner a total of about 2 hours in 2 weeks in July. It’s nothing fancy - but everything you need."

Stayed with a pet","Jake's place was the perfect spot for our 1st little family vacation.
Dawn was super attentive, just a text away. Always great to get an email from her wishing us great times at the lake, things to do and especially asking if we needed anything.
Jake's place has its own private beach in which my great nephew & 100lb dog had to go at least twice a day.
kayaking was great.. came across a beautiful lilly pad patch blooming & growing.
the new deck is a great added feature. we spent more time there than inside. it has a perfect view of Plesant lake from the deck. 4th of July fireworks from the deck, were amazing. we didn't have to go anywhere to see them.
I'll definitely be looking for Jake's place for my next MI trip.
Thanks Jake 🙂🙃🙂🙃"

The decorated tree was a most welcome surprise and helped us celebrate the season; its cool snowman theme was all that we saw of the white stuff, given the unseasonable warm weather! The Archers were well-prepared hosts who literally went the extra mile(s): when the electronic lock was on the fritz, they were able to let us in immediately by remote and then drove out at night in the foggy rain to fix it."

Stayed with kids","Our family of 6 adults and 3 children under 8 found this a perfect place for our annual long weekend. The house was amazing and very comfortable for all of us to relax, sleep well, play games and prepare our meals in a well planned kitchen. The easy access to the lake and dock was a big plus for the fishers who could just drop a line off the dock. The pontoon boat was more perfect than the weather, but we used it daily and was the highlight for the family.
Archer was an exceptional host. We have many years of rental experience and I have never felt so prepared and welcomed as we were in this beautiful home. The attention to detail in each room was appreciated (chargers, usb ports, quality kitchen wares, bath essentials, tvs, ceiling fans, linens, laundry room).
We would love to return to this home and will highly recommend to family and friends."

Beautiful, well-kept home with so many amenities.  My grandchildren loved all of the board games, air hockey, ping pong...  The host was kind and responsive.  The place was very clean, and the linens and beds comfortable. We enjoyed the huge deck which has ample seating, a jacuzzi and a grill.  We had a memorable stay and would love to stay there again.

Stayed with kids","This was the perfect place for us to spend a lovely Christmas weekend. We felt right at home and so welcome in this beautiful home by the lake.
Firstly, the owner of the home was extremely helpful and communicative. We felt like a friend was welcoming us to share their home over the holidays. We also had to make some adjustments to our travel plans due to a snow storm. Shiloh was very accommodative of our change in plans. The home is even lovelier than the pictures. It has all the essentials ( and more!) and we did not have to step out even once to buy anything that was missing over our 3 day stay.
The home was clean and comfortable. Our kids had a great time playing ping pong, air hockey etc in the basement. The sight of a lit Christmas tree against the backdrop of a frozen snow covered lake was the perfect way to spend our weekend get away with friends. Thank you Shiloh and family for welcoming us into your home. We hope to be back again in summer."

Stayed with kids","Absolutely fantastic lake get away. Location on the lake is perfect for the view and awesome sunsets. The house is spotless and very well appointed. There is plenty of room for our family inside, but we spent most of our time on the multi-tiered deck and on the water. Our visit was during the week and the lake was very quiet. There were times when we pretty much had the lake to ourselves for tubing and fishing.
Host communication is by far the best of any rental experience I've had. They made sure we had everything we needed from booking to check-out. They even went above and beyond to help fix an issue with the tube we brought with us.
You will not be disappointed in Archer Lake House. We'll be back for sure!"

Group trip","We did a lot of research for our stay and actually we had reserved another place before our stay with Archer. The place we initially reserved got canceled due to some water heater issues and we were disappointed but not anymore since if that did not happen we might have missed the interaction with an amazing host like Archer and a beautiful home. From the time we booked house all the details were provided, since we were new to the place, we did not know all the details around and Archer provided us with every information. Archer even looked up places for us and checked on us periodically from checkin until checkout and was very kind. Coming to the house, it’s a beautiful lake house, The house was very clean and very well maintained with everything you need provided. The rooms are very spacious and very cozy and the master had a really nice shower that a lot of the girls in our group really liked. I was also told about some new upgrades coming to the house soon. The weather was not very good on our first day but we never felt the need to go out and find something’s to do as we were allowed to use everything in the house including some of their pedal and paddle boats, ping pong table etc. During all my stay with Airbnb I have either had a great house or a great host, in our stay at this lake house we got a chance to stay at a beautiful home and interacted with even more beautiful hosts. Really happy to have greeted this way and nothing but just nice things to say about the house and the host. Do visit this place as we would be thinking about it again as well to go back sometime again in the future."

He had kayaks and paddle boards and other things for the lake that he let us use. Lane made himself available to us for anything we needed. He also had firewood and fire pits for the kids to make s’mores. We were going to rent the pontoon boat, but we unfortunately had bad luck with the weather. Luckily, there are many things to do with the kids in town nearby. The adventure zone had a lot for the kids to do and there are several great restaurants in town. The lake house is very comfortable and is set up with everything you could need. We will definitely plan on coming back and staying here again. Great memories with the family."

Group trip",Lane was great to work with. We had way more vehicles than an average guest would have and Lane helped with plenty of parking and even provided extra extension cords for us to charge our boat batteries. Just an all around good guy!

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I needed last minute reservations for a weekend getaway and came across this listing late in the day. Lane was quick to respond and confirm our booking. We were met with freshly baked cookies and a beautiful view of the lake. The weekend was fantastic. Lane even rented us a pontoon for the following day even though it meant he had to drag it out after dark, (bring your Northern Pike gear, the lakes got nice ones) . And was still kind enough to show me around the lake quick and loan me a fishing pole as I hadnt thought to bring one. He truly went above and beyond to accommodate our stay. Cant leave a nice enough review. The view of the sunset from the cabin is amazing also. Just an all around great experience."

Stayed with kids","Lane and Kim were great hosts, especially as the trip was a last minute decision on our part to go. They were very quick to respond to our questions and accommodating to requests. There was a little confusion in regards to boat rental availability but I think that was due more to our late decision to book a place for the weekend and not hosts fault (and Lane was kind enough to accommodate us on his time as well). Overall enjoyed the place and weekend and look forward to coming back soon"

Stayed with kids","Such an amazing home on the lake with so many extra amenities!! My favorite Airbnb/VRBO rental. Three bedrooms as you walk in and another on the walk out to pool level. They let us drive around to back lower level to load near kitchen. Fire pit, pool, pontoon/kayak options. Plenty of seating in kitchen area and plenty of plates, plastic ware and silverware/pots & pans for large families. Close to Walmart, playground, ice-cream and putty golf. Weather was gorgeous and the well-maintained home was such a blessing for our family gathering. We had 3 couples and 3 toddlers. Highly recommend!! Mary was very helpful and kept in touch as much or little as needed."

Great for families- lots of space and activities. The house was very well taken care of with super comfortable beds and furniture. The pool was pristine and heated to such a comfortable temperature that we spent every morning in the pool! We rented the boat and had such a nice time enjoying the water! Bring your fishing pools and your sunscreen! We will definitely come back here!

Nice big lake for swimming, boating, fishing, etc. feeds into a few other lakes or rivers also. (Except for the tornado sirens going off a few times in one night, we had a real good time.) golf course down the road, adventure golf and go karts w/in 5 miles, aqua adventure park close by and only a short drive to town if you forgot anything.

The place itself is extremely comfortable, we’ll appointed, and has fun little extras unseen at any other place we’ve stayed(I.e. paddle boat, kayaks, etc.) we could tell as soon as we walked in, this cottage has the comforts the owner would want themselves.
Property is private and offers all the tranquility you could want, nestled into a relaxing backdrop of birds, trees, and lake access. Close to local shops and cuisine, as well as big box stores for any shopping and entertainment you have in mind. Walmart, nature hikes, to the drive-in theater all right around the corner, giving you everything you need plus unique experiences around Coldwater. Five stars all around!
Tony is a great host and is extremely communicative. We can’t wait to see them again and go back!"

The shower was a challenge for us. It is tiny. It serves the purpose but be ready to stand still and move very little. It was not easy for my husband who is 6’2”.
The view makes up for everything else."

Stayed a few nights","I was needing to escape the pressures of regular life for a few days and was looking for a place to relax, on very short notice. I came across Tony's cottage, which looked perfect for my needs, including the price. Tony responded to my inquiry within an hour, and was, thankfully, able to accommodate me and my dog on such short notice.
Tony was there to greet me when I arrived, and he made sure I knew where things were and that I had everything I needed. He's very friendly and did a great job at being very available when/if I needed him, while still being very respectful of my need for solitude.
The cottage was everything I expected, and more. The pictures don't really do the inside justice, as the main rooms were much larger than I expected, especially the gorgeous sunroom facing the lake. When inside, I spent nearly all my time in there, including sleeping on the day bed so I could have the view of the beautiful lake as soon as I woke up. The bed in the master bedroom looked really comfortable, even if I didn't sleep in it. The place can easily sleep 7 or 8. It was also nice to have a fully functioning kitchen, and a washing machine and dryer, even though I didn't need to use it.
Outdoors, there's a really nice, large lawn, keeping neighbors not too close together. When I was there in early March, I had complete privacy. There was only 1 other occupied cottage on the same road. The lake was nearly all melted and I saw several geese and ducks on the water, as well as a couple swans. There is a lot of outdoor seating available, my favorite being the swing from the tree.
I really hope to spend more time at the cottage when it warms up. It looks like a great swim spot and I would love to put that kayak to use! I also just love the sounds of crickets and frogs at night, so I need to come back for that! It's the best thing to fall asleep to IMO, and makes for a really restful sleep.
Thanks again, Tony!"

Stayed a few nights","Maybe good for others, but we would have been better off getting a hotel in town. Stayed for a formal event which made it worse because we couldn’t iron anything or blow dry our hair for styling. Upstairs room with the single large bed was freezing. If staying here, make sure you pack an ironing board (just the board- they have an iron), blow dryer, and personal heater if you plan on sleeping upstairs."

The house did not have air conditioning, which is advertised, but even with bringing our own box fans, I was still hot on the top floor of the house.
The house was clean and Robertina was a fantastic host, but I do feel that the nightly rate along with the cleaning fee was a bit high for what the house actually is."

Stayed a few nights","My son graduated from Trine University on May 4, 2024 at 10 a.m. and we were coming from 3 hours away. Staying at the Seaglass Cottage in Coldwater was perfect for our graduation needs. We used the grill to grill steaks on Friday evening, we had enough space for all to sleep, and it was only 20 easy, minutes away from campus. This graduation was extra special as my son was a part of the senior class of 2020 and never had a high school graduation. Thank you for helping us to celebrate his college graduation! It's a great place for Trine families to stay, when visiting their students!"

Group trip","It was a 5-star experience for our staycation near Coldwater lake over the Christmas eve weekend. Great place, away from daily noises. In fact we believe there should be more photos of the walking deck area in the website. That’s a pretty nice place to chill in the evening. You guys should advertise it better!!
The Coldwater lake is a pristine water body with calm neighborhood. The amenities were really nice. We got almost everything we looked for in the kitchen and other rooms.
The only suggestions from our side will be:
1. Adding one or two more chairs/stools to sit in the dining space or living area.
2. A dishwashing liquid and kitchen-top cleaner for the kitchen.
Overall we had a great stay and a fulfilling vacation!"

Stayed a few nights",Oh this was a nice surprise. The kitchen area was much bigger than we expected and had everything we needed. There were 2 washer and dryers which made it easy for us to keep up with laundry. Most places that we stay have laundry features but they are so tiny that our family of 4 can only wash a few outfits at a time. We easily fit everything at one go. The beds were comfy and the place was super clean. It was very cold so we didn't spend too much time on the patio but those few moments were beautiful. There was a cute little fire pit area outside. We were close to Coldwater Lake so we were able to wake up early and head to the lake for a nice sunrise jog.

Stayed about a week","The property is as described and the pictures are showing the property as is but some updates definitely need to be done. The property is about 20 minutes driving from Coldwater, not a huge issue but be mindful if you want some nightlife, there’s none near to the house and it’s a long drive on very dark country roads. The kitchen was well equipped. Washer and dryer there too so that was a plus. Some ambient noise and another neighbour constantly crossing the property but not later at night that I was aware of. Personally, I felt very isolated at the house and would hesitate to recommend but if that’s your thing then this property is perfect."

The only minor downside was the location, as the house wasn’t super private and neighbors would occasionally have loud music while cooking out or something similar. Otherwise, house was fairly tidy and comfy to stay in!
Overall, I would definitely book with Seaglass again, though if I needed to be in cold water again the location would be on a consideration list but not a for sure yes."

Group trip",This place was exactly as described and perfect for our weekend! We have a family cottage on the next street over and we will be renting this place again for weekends that are crowded over there! Most of the things needed are in the unit and it was a very comfortable home away from home. The dock availability for the boat was so convenient and made the lake so accessible! Coldwater Lake is one of my favorite places in the world and finding this gem just made it better!!

We were able to launch kayaks from the canal, but preferred to go from the lake launch due to the murkiness of the canal. Good sized deck. Beds comfortable. Air conditioning works. Decent sized side-lawn for some outdoor games."

Stayed a few nights","This home is in a great location and has plenty of room. It would have been perfect for our needs traveling with two of our teen youth group from church. Unfortunately, our stay did not go as well as we'd hoped due to there being no hot water, no way to keep the hot water heater or gas stove pilots on, and a lack of cleanliness (there was food crumbs on the dishes and the kitchen floor and a soda bottle and dirty mop on the deck as we entered the home. The hosts are super hosts and are great at responding so I don't fault them at all, just whomever is managing the property for them. Also, if you like your privacy, be advised that there is no door between the master bedroom and bathroom, only a nearly sheer curtain hanging on a rod that does not give any real privacy."

Stayed one night","The cottage is cute but could be cleaner and more comfortable. There were stains on the bedsheets and the bathrooms, especially the jacuzzi, could have been cleaner. The mattresses were comfortable except for the bunk beds, which were extremely soft and worn out. Halfway through the night, we stripped the sheets and slept on the floor. It was not relaxing at all.
The house is still worth it for value since I imagine you might pay more for a small, dingy cabin. There are also thoughtful touches throughout the house. However, two members of our party, including myself, were not satisfied because of the bunk beds."

Within 20 minutes they had sent over a neighbor with a spar key to let us in. The house was stocked with everything we needed to prepare dinner, the grill was very handy, and there was enough wood for a fire. We spent the evening playing card games and having dinner on the patio. The view of the lake was an amazing added extra to our relaxing weekend. We are saving this place and will be back many many more times."

We stay in Coldwater every year for Christmas and have paid up to twice as much per day for dingy, unkempt, dated old cabins.

It was not an issue for us, but nice to know they were aware. Dock was perfect for our pontoon to leave overnight and boat launch is super close. The home is beautiful with plenty of space.

Throughout our stay, we were impressed by how responsive you were to any questions or requests we had. Your attention to detail and willingness to go above and beyond to ensure our comfort and enjoyment truly set you apart as exceptional hosts.
As for the cottage itself, we cannot say enough good things about it. They had everything we could have possibly needed for a relaxing and enjoyable weekend getaway.
Overall, we highly recommend your cottage to anyone looking for a peaceful and rejuvenating retreat. Thank you again for your warm hospitality!"

Stayed a few nights","This was my first experience with Air BNB. It went very smooth and the place was clean and neat. I loved that there were games available, we brought our own but was great to see some there. Appreciate that there were coffee filters for the coffee pot because I totally forgot to buy some! There were also any kitchen essentials you may need as well. The cottage is decorated super cute and the space was adequate. My only concern would be that the shower is very small, it's just what it is in a smaller cottage not a complaint as much as a warning if you're a larger person that may be an issue for some folks. Treva was awesome in response to my emails and I would stay there again without hesitation. Thank you so much for such a beautiful place to stay!"

We’ve never stayed at an Airbnb yet and was a little skeptical at first but once we got there that all blew out the window ! This was like a home away from home …. We live in an apartment and have never had a yard so this was soooo much fun ! Would definitely stay here again and plan to come back as a vacation !

Then relaxing by the fire pit with drinks in the evening. Great spot and we will definitely be back! Thanks Ralph and Treva for a great vacation!"
