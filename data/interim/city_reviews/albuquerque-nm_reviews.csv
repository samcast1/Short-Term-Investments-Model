Stayed a few nights","Cute little room with attached bathroom that was great for a few nights stay. The house is very near to all the shops you need and easy to get on the highways and main streets. The bed is very soft so just something to be aware of if you prefer a firm bed, but I was able to get comfortable and slept well thanks to the noise machine!"

Stayed a few nights","Incredibly gracious hosts and a quaint space that makes the most of every inch without feeling cluttered. Lovely and bright and oh so comfortable. I had to leave early for a family emergency and they were very helpful.
FYI, the entrance is on the side (I didn't realize that), so you'll have to walk across graveled pathway with your bags. But it also makes for a private space. Also, as listed, the pups can get a bit vocal in the mornings, but quiet down after not too long.
Recommend and would happily stay again."

Its pet friendly and we only heard the dogs once as we were leaving, but nothing when we arrived late in the evening. Communication is great and there are lots of eating options a short walk or frove away in Nob Hill.
Little touches like toiletries were and a dog bowl with fresh water are just a few things to make guests feel welcome. We would recommend this space."

Check in and check out was easy and the owner was flexible with check in time for me which I appreciated. You do hear some noises from the main house as the Airbnb is basically a separated back bedroom and bathroom of the main house, but the noises didn’t bother me and were not overly frequent or loud. Overall I would stay again for a short trip. Thank you!"

Stayed one night","Great communication with Kayleigh who went outside as I was a bit confused if I was in the proper location. I appreciated the tea, lotion, and love lavender scented products. Space is small and compact, definitely more of a space to rest up on travels. I enjoyed the decor which is primarily why I chose this air bnb. The shower had piping hot water which I need and appreciated. The temperature drops and bed/pillows were comfy. The sunlight comes in so beautifully and lights up the room. I'm a sensitive sleeper and could hear feet shuffling, cabinets opening and closing, etc in the main part of the house. About a 10 minute drive to Hotel Albuquerque and Sawmill Market where there is an abundance of food options."

I loved the quality of the products that she offered and the local products available to purchase are a bonus too. We arrived after dark but had no trouble finding our way in. It was really a perfect spot to stay. I have a few Aibnbs and took away some great ideas as Kayleigh clearly cares about her guests and their experience and has set this small space really well!

Even in the small space there was everything we could need. The space was clean and cozy. Parking on the street was easy and Kayleigh's communication was great. Would definitely stay here again!"

We had everything we needed for our night and got a great night’s sleep after a long day of driving. Kayleigh communicated well and we could tell she spent time making the beautiful space for guests. The whole experience was what I hope for when booking Airbnb stays—safe, quiet, clean, and comfortable. Definitely book this as the price is a steal! :)"

Stayed one night","Albuquerque Drivers Review: Be prepared. Holy moly! Let me start by saying New Mexico has some insane drivers. I’m sure there’s tons of fender benders daily being so fast and reckless. Driving in a packed car moving from Oregon to Texas was really scary with the sun setting where it’s right in your eyes and an already limited view due to packed car. I’ve lived in LA, Arizona, the PNW, and never seen anything like this. Reminded me of being in a taxi in New York.
Airbnb Review: Small space that’s maximized very well. Aesthetically pleasing as there were a series of home decor/design moments throughout the space which makes it appealing. Good for 1 person or a couple. It felt small just me and my two cats. Mattress nice and soft. Don’t drink bathroom sink water. I make chamomile tea at night and had to dump the water and use some I brought. The only note I would give is that the saw dust/mulch is easier to walk on than those rocks on the side path to the Airbnb unit for travelers who are likely lugging items. There were a couple times I was worried I’d roll my ankle. Also wheeled luggage would be easier to roll on the saw dust mulch than rocks plus it would also emphasize the path giving contrast to the main rocked area."

Stayed with a pet","Loved the location and ease of this small guest suite! Kayleigh was a wonderful Airbnb host as she was very communicative leading up to and during the stay. The guest suite was immaculately clean and I appreciated the small touches such as being able to purchase NM special chocolates, cactus soap, NM print masks, etc.
One thing to note as a heads up is that I was able to hear sounds and thumps from the main house (3am and early AM), but Kayleigh did mention that the night of my stay was the exception because their new puppy was adjusting to their home that night. Another heads up is that the thermostat is located in the main house, so in order to change the temp, you can reach out to Kayleigh. It was a very toasty 69 degrees but they had a ceiling fan."

Stayed one night","Mary went the extra mile to make our stay A+. The room and her home had everything an Airbnb guest could need or want. We appreciated her flexibility, particularly with us arriving late at night and allowing for a late check out so we could take a quick nap after waking early to attend the balloon fiesta. We would have no reservations about recommending Mary’s place to a friend visiting Albuquerque!"

Stayed a few nights","Mary and her cats were a joy to stay with! There were no other guests while I visited and Mary was away on a trip for several of the days, so I had a nice time to myself chilling out with the animals. The room was lovely and you are given free range of the house (including the kitchen and spacious backyard/patio), which is very nice. The only thing I'd gotten confused about from the photos was thinking there was a private patio entrance - both rooms can only be accessed through the main house. The location is very quiet and peaceful, but it's best if you have car access because the neighborhood is a bit of a distance to any amenities and getting a ride share on the west side of ABQ can be challenging. Mary was a lovely and responsive host and her pets were extremely friendly as well!"

Stayed a few nights","I had such a great stay at Mary's place. Staying with her was like staying with a long-time friend. She greeted me in driveway on arrival and gave tour of the place while going over what I shall expect during my stay. Her amazing kitty cats also joined in for the tour. The room was equipped with comfy bed, tv, desk, chair, a couple fans for those hot summer days, though not needed as here home was perfect temperature and a mini fridge. The bathroom was superb as it included a jacuzzi tub as well. Her home was beautifully decorated throughout, including the backyard and patio. Mary is really a super host, whose hospitality goes above and beyond. The details of providing a mini coffee bar, setting aside a shelf in kitchen refrigerator for guests, and setting out little dishes of snacks and mini candies definitely did not go unnoticed. My favorite part of stay was the conversations Mary and I shared out on back patio. I highly recommend Mary's place if visiting New Mexico."

Stayed a few nights","My stay at Mary's was beyond enjoyable. Mary is a absolutely lovely person that truly made me feel welcome and invited into her home. From the moment I entered her home, I felt as if I have lived there for years. Thoughtful details such as a complete coffee bar and snacks in several places throughout the home helped make her home stand out. Mary's home is located in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood that that is conveniently located close to the airport. When here, be sure to enjoy a cup of coffee under the gazebo while watching a sunrise and listening to the birds. The rate that is charged to stay is beyond reasonable and one would be truly missing an amazing deal if passing up on her home. Thank you again, Mary, for a wonderful first time in Albuquerque."

Cons: One of the cats, the really friendly one, likes to gently gnaw on human toes. He doesn’t break the skin. It tickles more than anything else. So if you’re ticklish, you might want to be sure to wear closed-toed shoes when you hang out in the public part of the house."

Group trip","We looked for a place for us to get away for the long weekend and this beautiful home did not disappoint. The kids enjoyed themselves so much they had plenty to do, there was a game room, as well as a pool table, and more fun games for them and the adults to enjoy. The house was very spacious for four families we had more than enough room, we didn’t not feel like we were in each other’s space. The backyard looked just the pictures, we had so much space for plenty of activities. We really enjoyed the house and would rent again in we had the chance to."

Stayed one night","Actually our stay was good and I would recommend this AirBnB. But we had to wait for our check-in as the AirBnB was not ready even though we could book it “immediately”. This can be improved. The host offered us to stay in one of her other two AirBnBs, but we did not want to change as these would have been not as quiet as this one according to their reviews. We would have expected the AirBnB to be ready if the option to immediately book it is activated. Also Netflix was not working and the host unfortunately did not respond to our request to fix the issue. All in all, the AirBnB is located in a really nice neighborhood and we liked to stay there."

It is convenient to both the I-40 and I-25 freeways but the neighborhood is a collection of post WWII homes ranging from small to quite large. It was a pleasant area to walk in day or night time. Its a very comfortable home for the two of us with a roomy bedroom and nice living room eating area. It was like staying at a friends home, not like some places which are completely furnished with Ikea stuff. Nice oriental rugs on floors, comfortable, nice older furniture. A small kitchen and bathroom but more than adequate for our needs."

I have requested a full refund from Airbnb. The casita is gorgeous and was clean with interesting art/ location, plentiful hot water and a comfy bed BUT I did not appreciate hunting for the welcome book without success so looking online and finding it mostly out of date. Kitchen- food on crockery/no hand towel or tea towel or cloth to wipe surfaces. No info about what to recycle/ several pans need to be removed as the non stick surface is badly damaged. No tea and chipped mugs. No plugs for kitchen sinks. Bedroom- couldn't use main light as remote was missing/ box of dead cockroaches in cupboard- need clearing and dirty washing removing/ sheets incorrect size for bed. Terrible and inconsistent wifi. Bathroom- no hand towels or bath cleaner/cloth. Generic communication before and after visit. Initial responses to my concerns then nothing"

Stayed a few nights","The location of this Airbnb was fantastic, close to the Old Town and downtown Albuquerque. The casita was in the back yard of the owner’s house; this owner seemed to be a different person than the host. There was a nice fountain in the courtyard but the patio seemed a bit disheveled and it was unclear what parts were ours to use. It would have been nice to have dish towels and luggage racks. Also, the sheets on the bed were not the right size for the bed which was really annoying; we like to make the bed each day and have our space neat and this bedding made it difficult. This could be very easily remedied.
Overall we enjoyed our stay."

We are too young to rent a car, so the fact that this place is walkable made our stay very easy. We especially loved how the kitchen is fully equipped with plenty of cooking materials and appliances. The people who live in the main house are friendly, and so is Lupa the dog. Lacy's place has everything you need for a lovely getaway to Albuquerque. I would highly recommend it to anyone, and I will surely stay again if I ever return to Albuquerque."

Stayed a few nights","Aesthetically the place was nice, but almost everything to do with the plumbing was bad. I paid 300$ for two nights and the hot shower handle fell off, the toilet wouldn’t flush I had to fix it myself by adjusting the chain length inside, the shower head was not putting out water and fell off, I had to stand under it while it dripped on my head. And the kitchen sink is clogged with something which made it hard to do dishes. I was a place to bring my girlfriend to, but I would have been embarrassed so I didn’t. Id rather have gone somewhere else that had working parts for plumbing than stay somewhere aesthetic. It was difficult to get ahold of Lacy as she never answered the phone out of the three times I called. She was slow to respond with text messaging. And when she did respond, she just asked for photos but did not bother to fix the components. She later offered me another place but it was too late in the day and I had plans. I asked if I could get a credit and was offered 5% off. ☹️"

Stayed a few nights","All in all, we had a nice stay in the casita.. The location is excellent - it's in a lovely and coveted neighborhood in ABQ and was easily walkable to a variety of restaurants, coffee shops, and bars. The space itself was bright and quiet with some nice decorations. Lacy was very proactive with communication and on more than one occasion checked in to see how things were going. There were a few things, though, that didn't quite live up to the expectations I had based on the photos, description, and especially price (I'm from ABQ and have stayed in several airbnbs around town while visiting family). The biggest one was the bed - we stayed for a week and had a terrible time sleeping. I realize mattresses are a very subjective thing, but both my partner and I found the bed to be extremely firm (hard, really) and we tossed and turned on it every night. The photos make the space seem nicer and more polished, wherein reality things felt a little shabby. Overall, though, a good spot."

Had some very heavy rains the first night and there was a water leak in the ceiling that saturated part of the couch. You will find some small bugs in the house and the cleaning staff left a lot to be desired in the bathroom. Perhaps that was a one time issue; overall a good place to stay in Albuquerque"

The little casita is well equipped if you wish to make a few meals, the bed is super comfortable.

Stayed a few nights","Lacy manages the Airbnb properties and she is friendly. The casita itself was cute and the location is good. However, the casita is in the backyard steps from the owners' house, so there is very little privacy. In addition, the female owner was unfriendly and unwelcoming. The owners had out of town guests parked in the spot reserved for the Airbnb casita guest. The check-in process was confusing, particularly in the dark. A nice thing to do would be to leave an outdoor light on when you know you have a single female arriving late at night. I won't be giving these owners any business in the future unfortunately."

Stayed with kids","Stayed for a few days during the Balloon Fiesta. It was about 15 minutes from the fiesta field, about 10 minutes from Old town & other sites. Nearby chain restaurants & grocery stores. Great location as far as getting around the city!
The house was clean, tidy, & without clutter. Located in a small neighborhood, we didn't see hardly anyone out and about - a few barking dogs at night, but inside the bedrooms it was quiet enough for sleeping. Mattresses & pillows were a bit flat/squishy & the bed frames were squeaky - but everything was clean.
Appreciated that the house came with the essentials (soaps, paper products, etc) along with water bottles and candy to greet us! It was nice to have access to the two stall garage to be able to park the cars. Would appreciate another couch or some chairs for additional seating in the living room. Serge was easy and quick to respond. Was accommodating to let us check in a bit early! Overall Serge's place worked out well and we'd stay there again."

Stayed over a week","This place is fantastic! I would definitely recommend staying here!
Serge and Karyna are wonderful hosts. The place was clean and smelled lovely when we arrived. They thoughtfully included a few snacks, a helpful handbook, and every single essential we needed for our stay. I'm talking laundry needs, dishwashing needs, cleaning needs, plenty of TP, and paper towels, plenty of shampoo, soap, conditioner, plenty of towels, hangers, blankets and pillows. Just...everything! It immediately put us at ease, feeling cared for and carefree!
Communication with Serge and Karyna was smooth and easy. Any issues or questions I had were immediately addressed and answered by the hosts.
The place is spacious and airy. I had no idea how much I enjoyed a roof window/skylight until I stayed here (don't worry - they aren't in the bedroom in case you like to sleep in a bit like me!). It filled the space with sunlight during the day which was so cozy. Each room was pleasantly decorated and plenty big. There was just 2 of us staying in this house during our trip, but it could very reasonably hold a small group without feeling like you are on top of one another.
10/10 would recommend."

It was clear that host John cares a lot about the happiness of his guests. Each morning we found a newspaper on the doorstep, and sometimes a little something from the garden. We only used one of the bedrooms, but the bed was very comfortable. Also the kitchen was very well stocked with everything we needed to enjoy cooking at home during our 2wk stay. We would definitely stay here again whenever our family members can not accommodate us at their home. 5 stars!"

The host called to check in day of check in- we were checked in on when we arrived and made sure we got in okay! There were ZERO issues that arose while staying there and everything was clean, all we could think of needing was provided(dishes/pots/cleaning supplies/ shampoos/conditioners/extra pillows and so on), spacious, gorgeous house, serene landscape, and exactly how it was described!!

The property is on a fruit orchard (cherries and apples) and if you are fortunate enough to visit during harvest time, John will visit with you as he pulls samples off the nearest tree (we were there at cherry time) for you to enjoy.
This awesome place was actually his home (he lives next door) and is completely furnished and decorated as though he still lives there!
Oh and don’t be surprised if he delivers a half dozen eggs from his chickens along with some veggies from his garden each morning plus today’s ABQ newspaper!
Don’t overlook this great stay!"

I just loved the farm-like setting and felt so at peace and away from the city, yet only 15 minutes away from the places that we came to visit. This is probably the first Air BnB where I have stayed (and we've stayed in many) where I choose to drive home and enjoy the property whenever I could. :-) I just loved drinking a cup of tea on the porch in the afternoon, with views of the cherry trees, chickens and farm land. There was so much peace and quiet, and we would certainly love to stay here again if we return to ABQ. Thanks!"

Stayed with a pet","My family and I enjoyed this place a lot. We traveled with our dogs a teen and a kiddo. It was exactly as described, very clean and full of great vibes! We got surprised that although being very close to other houses, you cannot hear a peep - at least that was our experience during our stay from Thursday to Monday.
The place had all that we needed, and we felt right at home in it. We enjoyed the fact that the house was located just a few miles from parks, museums, The Breaking Bad Store LOL! And some other amazing places.
The host is very responsive, and easy to deal with.
Overall, we highly recommend it, and we hope to come back soon!"

Secluded mountain home in a small neighborhood. Upscale amenities. Comfortable and peaceful. Ashlee and Janosnhave spared no expense. The patio was my favorite just being surrounded by the Sandia mountains (ancient home of the Sandia Indian tribe). Evening cocktails on the patio and morning coffee outside were just what the doctor ordered. We cooked six dinners and went out one night. Her local recommendations are spot on!
It felt like home and we fell in love with Albuquerque and New Mexico. This is the perfect base for exploring the region yet we were always eager to return to the house. We have sun, wind and snow all in our week here. Nature lovers will appreciate this majestic home in the mountains. And you’re 20-25 minutes from everything you need in town.
We can’t wait to come back and stay here and explore more!"

We hiked the la luz trail just a 2 min drive up the road. It's views are amazing too.
We got 4 inches of snow the next day and hiked the la luz again in the falling snow. Beautiful! ( a very short hike). Had trouble getting back up the first hill in the snow and had to get out and push. But later in the morning snow plows cleared the roads. Very nice!
Such a beautiful place to stay! Will do it again sometime!"

Day weekend and it was perfect! Cabin is AMAZING! Rustic and charming with all the amenities you’d want. Gas fireplace, wrap around deck, kitchen with all the necessities. Gerardo is a great host and checked in to make sure our arrival was smooth. Cabin is equipped w/ pet door that leads to a fully enclosed dog run, so no worries about pets running off or protection from wildlife. Would highly recommend to tourists and locals alike. Perfect, much needed getaway. Love that travel didn’t eat up our time, but really felt like I was able to escape. Can’t wait to return. Secret’s out! I hope it’s available when we want to come back!

Stayed a few nights","The cabin is the second house on a dead end street in the woods - quiet and peaceful. It was very clean and had everything we needed. Gerardo kept in touch in case we needed anything.
Since rentals all come stocked differently, this isn’t a negative but for cooking there was just salt, pepper, and coffee pods. Best to bring anything else with you.
Also thinking this is just the way it is in the area in the winter but the water pressure was pretty low to the point that both showers couldn’t run at the same time. Not a big deal for the two of us but thought it was worth mentioning.
We loved sitting by the fire and watching the snow and going out to see the stars at night. The deck areas would be lovely in the summer."

If you plan on cooking, there is salt, pepper, and some kind of chicken spice but otherwise you’ve got to get your own. Also plan on getting your own sugar. We left our breakfast tea and some gluten-free pasta for the next guest. Refrigerator was clean and did not smell."

In town for three days, we wanted a walkable neighborhood, easy access to highways AND nature: Balloon Fiesta; birding: Sandra Crest & Rio Grande Nature Center; proximity to good food. Dan’s place checked all the boxes.
Moreover, the loft’s cleanliness, design, functionality/layout, amenities, artwork, and colorful and comfy furniture made for a lively and easy stay. After a few days on the road, we appreciated a real fridge and W/D. Loved the rooftop patio too.
Dan was a friendly, responsive host. Checking in/out remotely was a breeze. Great being next door to UNM too. All good — looking forward to “next time!”"

Stayed a few nights","We had a great time at Dan's place—what was particularly great about it is that it seemed like just about everything we wanted to do was super easy to get to. And parking at the place was a breeze—there were several available parking spots, and we never had a problem.
There's a great little coffee shop just a few blocks away, and a Walgreen's across the street, and a local grocery store pretty nearby. Lots of great restaurants as well.
The space was lovely, and having access to the rooftop patio was a nice bonus: we watched a beautiful sunset there one night.
Dan was very supportive and responsive, and often would send little check-in messages unprompted throughout our stay, which we appreciated.
The value was incredible—most of the other places we were looking at wouldn't have been quite as conveniently located, and were a significant increase in price, so it was nice to be able to feel like we got fabulous value out of the place.
Thanks to Dan for being a great host."

Kitchen and cupboards were stocked with what you’d need. Dan was very responsive and had great recommendations. Location was wonderful, as was parking. We got to walk to restaurants, entertainment, etc. The Nob Hill area is a great place to stay. Bed was firm and surprisingly comfy for a Murphy bed. Overall, good value."

Upon arrival, Kevin was very nice to greet us. The guesthouse was very clean with lots of teas, kcups and plenty of water bottles.
The living room does not have a TV, but it was perfectly fine as we had our phones and plenty of interesting books to read. I enjoyed browsing the books. I wished I had more time here so I could just sit and read.
The loved how there's so much natural light in the house. The half moon window in the living room allow a gorgeous view of the desert hills in the neighborhood. It was breath taking.
The memory foam mattress was very comfortable. My favorite part was the bedding. OMG. The genuine goosedown comforter and bed linens were so soft. It felt like I was snuggling on a cloud.

Stayed a few nights","This stay was absolute perfection! From the location to the communication to the coziness - it was wonderful. Everything was clean and tidy when we arrived and Kevin was super responsive when we had questions or needed suggestions. They were available if needed, but honored our space and privacy. The location is perfect because it’s in a quiet, beautiful, secluded area, but close enough to town to run out for a last minute pizza or two! Need something to read? Your options are endless. We appreciated the cookies and beverages that welcomed us, as well as all the outlets and charging stations for our devices. The beds and pillows were comfy, and the coffee options were plenty.
One word of warning - Google maps is very inaccurate in the area, so have another option ready! (Obviously not their fault, but I thought it’s worth mentioning!)
Look no further for a place to stay because you won’t find one better than this. They set the BnB bar high!"

Stayed one night","THE BEST AIRBNB WE HAVE EVER STAYED IN. Everything was literally spotless. The level of cleanliness was absolutely superior to all other hotels and airbnb’s I have ever stayed in. The mattress was THE MOST AMAZING mattress I have ever slept on. The pillows were definitely high quality as well. No cheap mattress or $10 pillows here!! My husband and I were blown away at the level of comfort that was provided and the level of pristine condition that everything was in. The hosts were very helpful, kind, understanding, respectful, and hospitable. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. It was the absolute perfect destination after a long day of driving. Drinking water was provided which was so nice!!! As well as a coffee and tea area, and a mini fridge. All of our needs were met, and our expectations were truly exceeded. If you’re in New Mexico, you MUST stay here!!!!! You will not regret it!!!!"

Stayed a few nights","Absolutely loved this place!
My husband and I drove over 8 hours and Kevin's place was perfect after the long drive! it was quiet at night and the bed was exactly what we needed. My husband was in an accident a few years back in which his L2 vertebrae was crushed and replaced with a titanium cage. He will forever have back pain, but the bed at Kevin's place is similar to the one we have at home and it helps lessen his back pain. There were also black-out curtains in the bedroom which was great because we are on the night shift schedule, and we didn't change our schedule for the trip, so we were able to get to sleep quickly.
The view from the living area is amazing! There is coffee and tea and a desk area for laptop and working. There is a great variety of books as well. If we were staying longer, we would've definitely been reading from their selection. Kevin and his wife were so kind to us and were prompt in answering any questions! We cannot wait to stay here again!"

Towels and bedding are of excellent quality. Shower has removable handle and overhead adjustable rain shower. Host filled the fridge with water (a must have at this elevation) and coffee/ tea choices were top notch. I was torn between reading one of the stellar book choices or watching a movie on the state of the art television. Parking is located so close to the door and neighborhood is the best in Albuquerque.

The all glass window view was spectacular. There are no blinds or curtains impeding the amazing sunsets. That also makes for some bright sunlight at certain times of the day. The neighborhood is so quiet. It feels like you're so far away from town, but it's actually a short car ride. My husband and I would definitely stay here again on our next visit to Albuquerque.

There were endless details we loved, include cactus plants everywhere, smart lighting, the most comfortable beds, local magazines for more options for recreation, a fantastic hot tub (that also offered a view to sunsets!), and hiking just outside the door. The ONLY negative we experienced was that we had to leave. Our daughters, ages 11 and 13, loved having their own space. Trey was immediately responsive from time of booking to time of exit. His communication was so great that he felt like an old friend. This home was an absolute gem, and it made for an epic spring break getaway for our family.

My family and I enjoyed a magical weekend there with much laughter throughout the day graced by restful sleep at night. It was simply wonderful to wander into the kitchen every morning and nestle into one of the seating areas for coffee with whomever woke up next. And then in the afternoon to drive into town (15 minutes away) for lunch out or alternatively hiking the hillsides around the house. The house is conveniently located, in a very relaxing setting and everyone in our party remarked how they would happily live in Trey's house. We will definitely stay there again should the opportunity arise."

Although you can see highway 40 and the trucks rolling down the road, their was no sound from the traffic. We enjoyed early January and the snow was beautiful. The pictures do not do the home justice!
Trey checked in often, answered all questions and provided good information for check in and out. The home is a ""Smart Home"" so we struggled with the lighting for a minute or two but then figured it out. The layout of the home offers privacy for more than one couple or a family but still has an open, expansive feeling. All of the appliances were top notch and easy to use.
The location, on the outskirts of Albuquerque, allowed us to travel to many beautiful places !
We hope to return and enjoy this Airbnb again as it is one of our favorites!
Thanks Trey for everything!

- His house is very well designed where you have space for group activities but also secluded rooms for some quite time.
- The hot tub, and outdoor space made it pretty special. The property is in the mountains, which made surrounding very scenic. We also got to see a family of deer.
- House has a lot of books and a really good reading space. It also has a very good entertainment system.

Stayed a few nights","The best AirBnB we have ever stayed in - home and host.
We wish we could give more stars.
Beds, pillows, and furniture comfy. Hot tub and fire pit cozy. This beautiful home was easy to settle into. If you can peel away from the local New Mexican restaurants, you'll find the kitchen complete with anything you need to cook at this home away from home. Excellent wifi and office for remote work. Spacious for a family with teens to spread out. The home gets lots of beautiful light. If you're morning light sensitive, bring a sleep mask :)
An intangible - our teens are neuro-spicy (one ADHD & one Autistic). This home was GREAT for helping them feel at ease and met all their sensory/ comfort needs.
Trey was super helpful in finding food and entertainment. His Balloon Fiesta advice was sage. He always went the extra mile (including helping guide me to the best brewery and wrote a lovely note to welcome us). He even shipped our forgotten items to us!
Definitely a warm and kind host."

Group trip","This was absolutely one of the best Airbnbs I have ever stayed at.
To start off, I was very paranoid about staying at this place because it seemed too good to be true. The pictures were absolutely stunning and the listing only had 1 review. I even went so far as to message the 1 review and converse back and forth with them to see if this was a legit listing. When we arrived, I knew that I had made the right decision.
This house was gorgeous and the pictures didn’t do it justice. Trey was absolutely the best host I’ve ever communicated with. He was attentive and simply has designed an amazing home.
While there were a few hiccups with the lock situation, Trey was able to help IMMEDIATELY. I’ve had digital lock issues before at hotels though so I would never fault Trey for this.
The space is magnificent and so inviting for multiple guests. You can’t beat the location either. Nestled against the foothills you feel like you’re in a different oasis.
You will not be disappointed."

The home itself is stunning, yet comfortable with modern smart home features. The incredible picture windows look out over the beautiful mountains. The outdoor space is beautiful as well and we enjoyed some steaks on the grill and having our morning coffee on the porch.
The beds are some of the most comfortable I’ve slept on with luxury linens to boot! The master bathroom is phenomenal with its spa like shower and tub.
I loved the gas stove in the kitchen and fixing a nightcap using Trey’s craft cocktail area.
My husband appreciated the office to get work done while traveling and the WiFi was strong and reliable.

There are several nice restaurants and shops in the area and a grocery store right down the street. Waking up to a mountain view is also incomparable."

The home itself was a sanctuary of peace and rest. We were also within minutes to walking trails, which was great for our dog, Josie. All the amenities for a long stay were provided, and the hosts were always quick to respond with any needs that came up. We would 100% recommend this home to anyone coming to the Albuquerque area, and we hope to stay again someday. Thank you to our hosts!"

The private fenced yard with green grass was an absolute dream for her to run and feel right at home. Step inside and you marvel at how beautifully the historic qualities of this old Bridge house merge with modern furnishings, stunning art, ultra luxe bedrooms, linens and the coziest living room. We made some wonderful meals in the fully equipped kitchen and also enjoyed some of the fantastic restaurants and wine tastings just minutes down the road. Communicating with Leah was a breeze and there is no doubt that we'll be booking again for our next trip!! A GEM! HIGHLY RECOMMEND A++"

Great choice for a family with energetic boys who need to be outside in a fenced in yard (would be perfect if you wanted to bring your pet along too). Relaxing by the fire pit in the evenings was a wonderful way to end the day. All needed amenities were provided- the robes and snacks were a nice touch. Leah was so helpful and responsive- especially after we forgot our phone chargers in the master bedroom. Will be planning to stay here again for our annual trip.

From start to finish, our hosts were incredibly kind and accommodating, ensuring that our trip was as enjoyable as possible.
The location of the casita was perfect. Nestled in the beautiful village of Corrales, we were able to enjoy the tranquility and natural beauty of the area while still being within easy reach of Albuquerque. It was the perfect balance of peacefulness and convenience.
If you're looking for an authentic, cozy, and welcoming place to stay in Corrales while exploring Albuquerque, we highly recommend Leah's place. It's always a fantastic feeling to be greated by a very warm and welcoming host. A charming and homely atmosphere, made for a truly delightful experience. We would love to visit again in the future."

Stayed about a week","Leah's place is a fantastic spot when looking to stay in the Corrales/Rio Rancho area. The home was very comfortable and clean. You can tell that she has paid attention to the finer details to ensure a great stay for her guests. The beds are comfortable, towels are fluffy and soft, the living room is cozy and quiet. The home sits right next to the major road running through Corrales so there is regular traffic, but the home's walls are thick and do a great job of muting most of the road noise. Getting a solid night's rest was not an issue if you're a light sleeper like myself.
Overall, don't hesitate to stay here. Leah was communicative, the home is fantastic, and you're close to everything that you might need during your time in Corrales."

The house is well insulated, warm. Kitchen is well stuffed as well. Knifes are sharp, pots and pans pleasure to cook in. Amazing fenced garden, best in the area. Our dogs loved it and so did we. Great location, very peaceful, right on the trail along Corrales. Close to many trails around Albuquerque. Good restaurants. Our only struggle was that it is not walkable, especially important if you are with dogs. The host does not advertise it as such, so it’s not a complaint, just sharing in case important to someone reading this review. We could take our dogs in the morning onto the trail, but after sunset there wasn’t anywhere to go as most of the streets are dead ends.
Many thanks to our wonderful hosts for being very receptive and accommodating."

The whole house was well appointed with all the amenities you would need in the kitchen, including spices, oil for cooking, coffee, etc. and the bathroom also had all the essentials you might need, even an extra toothbrush if you happened to leave yours behind!

Communications with Leah were a piece of cake and she was always quick to respond.
Corrales is a perfect location if you want to be situated between Albuquerque and Santa Fe and prefer to stay out of touristy areas. The village is fantastic - terrific breweries, wineries, and restaurants are minutes away by car, the locals are extremely friendly and welcoming, and every convenience from Albertson's to Target is just up the road.

I was fortunate enough to stay there for two nights while attending the magical 50th Albuquerque International Balloon Festival. The home has a wonderful history and is as charming and beautiful as can be, with antiques galore and gorgeous artwork throughout. The bed I slept in was extremely comfortable with high quality linens. There were snacks in the kitchen, along with a welcome note and gift awaiting my arrival. I had my small dog with me and she loved the fenced-in yard with lush green grass (a rarity in the Southwest)! Communication was prompt, helpful and friendly, you couldn’t ask for better hosts! The property is well-located in beautiful Corrales, close to all that Albuquerque has to offer and plenty of its own special places to try. This is a rare find and I hope to return sometime soon."

Stayed a few nights","The Bridge House is excellent in every single way! The interior is beautifully decorated with a perfect combination of historic charm and modern updates, not to mention it was extremely clean! My husband had to work a full day during our stay and he was very happy with the wireless speed and desk accommodations. The location provides a quick and easy drive to Albuquerque and Rio Rancho, but you will never want to leave the views from the patios and the relaxing, peaceful atmosphere that the Village of Corrales offers! We can't wait to stay again and again!"

Stayed with kids","Book this AirBnB immediately! It’s so lovely, spacious, and unique — it’s what I hope for when booking AirBnBs. There are thoughtful touches everywhere — kids cups/plates in the kitchen, games and books in the living room, extra blankets, pillows, and linens, a welcome packets with recommendations for local spots, etc.
Corrales is adorable and this is perfectly located. We loved our stay!"

Stayed with kids","This is an adorable old-style authentically New Mexican adobe house. My family and I loved staying here. The host, Leah, had great communication leading up to the trip and during our stay. The added detail of snacks in the kitchen and a few toiletries in the bathroom were a really nice touch. The beds were super comfortable and the sheets were like butter. The house is very comfortable, clean and beautiful. Loved the decor. The location was close enough to Albuquerque, yet felt like you were a bit more out in the country. You could see donkeys across the street and vineyards. My family and I also appreciated reading through the house manual which detailed places to eat as well as the interesting history of the house and the city of Corrales. I would highly recommend this place to anyone! My family and I plan to stay here again the next time we come to visit our relatives in Albuquerque."

We used it for a bridal party to get ready and it was so much better than anything else we would have found!

Stayed with a pet",11 out of 10! This house is so special and there are many unique and interesting features about the house and furnishings. It was very spacious and comfortable and we really appreciated the cute little enclosed private yard. The local restaurant recommendations were helpful and our dinner at Indigo Crow was delicious! The location felt private but was also very convenient to food and groceries. There are wineries close by and we were able to get lots of fresh items at the Sunday morning Growers Market just a mile away. It was our first time visiting Albuquerque and our stay here made it extra memorable. Thank you Leah and Jason!

Since it was just one night we did not need much except for a bed and a shower before a long flight. Unfortunately, the shower was terrible - almost no water pressure and the water stayed stuck in the bathtub. Also no soap for washing your hands in the sink.
Other than that the place was clean and the night was quiet even though we shared the house with other people."

Very easy rude from the airport and I was given a power point with photos prior to my check in that helped make accessing my place a complete breeze! I would hands down stay here again (I was sad to leave!) and will be recommending to friends and family.! All the staff that I met on the grounds wee friendly and welcoming.

Stayed a few nights","The host(s) are all kind, cooperative and willing to answer questions. Their location is safe, secure and restful. I'll definitely look to them again in the future.
The instructions are a bit verbose. As a semi-professional writer, there's a lot of ""please read"" followed by ""also really important"". I can't even be mad, though because anyone who doesn't want to sift through all of that can simply message them directly and they'll take care of you promptly!
I'm glad I stayed here and give full credit to the host/co-hosts for not just ""getting me through"" my visit but making it convenient, efficient and positive.
Thank you."

Stayed a few nights","Great, cost efficient stay at this gated community right next to the Sunport Airport. It's listed as a microhotel, which is a great way to describe it. It's a mix between a hotel and a hostel. Each unit has multiple rooms with their own key code locks on the door handle to enter. You also need a key code to get into the community and into the unit itself. There are a lot of shared community items in the kitchen and free coffee. It was fairly clean, although a bit of clutter in the kitchen given that many guests seem to leave behind a lot of food without marking it as sharable and forget to do their dishes. I would suggest a once a month deep clean just to clear it and to get some of the harder to reach parts in the house/rooms. Can't beat this for the price though."

There is no kitchen, or even a microwave or even a table to sit at. The was a flimsy barn door that was locked and separated us from the rest of the house. It did not provide us with much security, privacy or sound control. I was woken up both nights we stayed there (at 1:30 and 2 am) from people on the other side of the door. We could clearly hear conversations, dogs walking around, a microwave, etc."

Stayed a few nights","The good:
This host is very quick to respond. Place was really clean. The Bathroom has been upgraded.
The neighborhood is nice. No loud parties or music at night. I felt safe here.
There is porch seating overlooking the street, which was nice in the evening.
There is an electric tea kettle, a keurig, mugs, spoons, and coffee/tea provided by the host.
The neutral:
""Filtered water"" means a pitcher filter in the fridge. You refill it from the bathtub.
You can hear the host and her dog through the doors and walls.
If you are using the sofa as a bed, there is not much seating.
The bad:
The electrical outlets all are worn, so its impossible to charge a device here. Plus, there is the safety issue of worn outlets sparking.
One window in the living room has only a sheer curtain on it (faces windows of host home and neighbor), and the front window has semi-sheers. No shades/blinds under either one. Felt really weird at night, especially for sleeping in the living room."

Her communication was much better than mine, and I felt taken care of in a nice clean place. While I meant to book for a few days, I mistakenly choose one, which resulted in a misunderstanding of checkout time. Meg was gracious to allow a rebooking with discounted cleaning, however, I was not up for the mandatory new app fees. I would definitely book again, preferably not while driving or working on the roof, to make life easier for everyone."

They added a nice touch in the room with a bunch of pamphlets on places to visit or eat if you've never been and I appreciated that especially since I had no clue what to do aside from my own original reason for visiting. They were also nice enough to let my friend and I go back and stay for a few hours because we had no place to go and our train was delayed. Super hospitable couple and if I go back to Albuquerque I definitely plan on booking with them again :)

From face wash, to body wash and shampoo/conditioner, a phone charger, cold beverages and more. I felt extremely welcomed and well taken care of. I’d 100% stay again if I ever find myself in ABQ!"

She and her fiance were flexible and were willing to pick me up from the train station and drop me off at the airport on snowy roads — totally worth the extra $15 as it saved me a lot of trouble with travel logistics. Also Truffle is a super sweet dog, and the linens are soft!"

Yo should definitely considering booking this place if you are in the Albuquerque area.

Stayed one night","Meg's place is the front section of their home. There is a large living room with TV and a comfy couch as well as a refrigerator where Meg provides drinks of various types. A curtain divides the AirBnB section from their living quarters. in addition to the living room, you have access to a private full bathroom and a large bedroom. The neighborhood is quiet. Restaurants on Central Avenue are about 10 blocks away.
Meg has a dog, Truffles. Truffles if very laid back and friendly and sleeps a lot.
Overall I had a good stay at Meg's place. I didn't meet Meg but spoke briefly with her partner. It's a fine place to stay on a business trip to Albuquerque."

Stayed a few nights","This is not a place I would come back to. The bed was very uncomfortable (we could feel springs poking through in any position) and we were surprised at the lack of attention to detail. For example, when we arrived at night the porch light was off and the living room light couldn't be turned on, the bathroom was not very clean (ring around the toilet bowl, spots on the mirror), and one of our hosts ran a coffee grinder or blender at 1am. On the bright side, Meg and Volk were very responsive to texts and Volk was very personable and helpful when we met him. They kindly left the porch and living room lights on the second night, left us filtered water and glasses, and had refreshments on offer. Their dog was also very sweet."
