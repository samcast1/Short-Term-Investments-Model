Stayed with kids","The community is quiet and peaceful as you pull up to a beautiful Airbnb. Check-in was simple and the house was cllean, well decorated, and spacious. It was perfect for our weekend trip. Julie checked in before during and after our trip which was very thoughtful. Shops were just around the corner and it's only 30 mins to Huntsville for more attractions. The kitchen was stocked with everything we needed to cook. Check out instructions were simple. We would definitely come back."

Stayed one night","I really enjoyed my stay! Cute little place and was very clean. Mandy answered a few questions I had, before I booked, very quickly and efficiently and she was on her game wishing me safe travels and providing me the entry code before check in so I didn't have to wait for a response. My best friend and I had a very peaceful and pleasant girls night out and the house was sufficiently furnished with extra throw blankets and all kitchen supplies needed to make our own dinner instead of having to go out. I would definitely recommend this house and host and will possibly be booking again in the future!"

Stayed a few nights","Mandy’s place is fantastic for My father and I. We have stayed here before and had another great experience :) It’s like new condition, super clean, and easy to get to. It’s Walking distance (5mins) to downtown with great boutique stores, restaurant, as well as other shopping centers. Moe’s BBQ is a nice big open place with large bar, eclectic industrial building, pool tables, shuffleboard, arcades and fantastic Nachos! The Frieghthouse Restaurant is very fine too, extra tasty food! Only thing that would make Mandy’s place better is if there were a grab railing at the shower and a handrail going into the residence. Older people or people with disabilities may have trouble in these spots. Thanks Mandy!"

The house is a good size for a small group. There is not a dining room table but plenty of space to spread out. A nice kitchen. Very clean all around. New appliances. Very comfortable. We will probably try to stay there again and would recommend it for a longer stay. Thanks Mandy!

The place itself was really amazing and nice, a bit overpriced for me but really good, well equipped and clean. it's really good for a family of 4-5 people and have all you need to feel at home :)"

It had lots of supplies in the kitchen, including lots of coffee. I didn't love the queen size bed. But I'm a bit finicky about my bed. A memory foam topper on it would had made it just right. Mandy had great communication and even gave us a couple suggestions for supper. We went to the train restaurant in town and it was WONDERFUL! We would definitely stay at Mandy's place again.

The only dislike I had was the doors had windows that were uncovered, but it was a easy fix! I would recommend anyone to stay and I would come again! Thanks for everything."

Stayed with a pet","From my experience I wasn't satisfied with Alot.. The TVs only worked for the first couple of hours after we arrived. never there after... there were a few k cups of coffee but no Suger/ no cream.. there wasn't but a couple of ice in a tray with the other one empty..The other Air BNB's I have had the pleasure of staying in had complementary coffee. cream, sugar. and a few snacks and the basics you may need to cook etc.. But there were none of that.. Then I cleaned up and took all my towels facecloths. & striped the beds. put everything in the laundry room just like I was told to do by the Host... not sure why I was charged a cleaning fee!! After I was gone I received a text and was informed that there was damage to a comforter as well as 2 missing blankets... SMH.. And I know for absolutely certain not to be true.. there were only 1 blanket and it was just thrown at the bottom of the bed and I never used it . It along with everything else was placed in the laundry.. so no TV nor wifi."

Stayed with a pet","What a wonderful house! I thoroughly enjoyed this lovely haven during my week long visit The decor was inviting, fresh and modern, the bedding luxuriously comfortable & there were thoughtful touches like a spa-quality robe in each closet, coffee, oatmeal & condiments in the kitchen & toiletries in the bathroom.
The back porch was a lovely space to work on my laptop or to be outside with my granddaughters while they played.
The checkout “to do’s” were refreshingly reasonable. I have stayed at Airbnb’s that had me working HARD cleaning, etc. before checking out & had decided that I was just going to go back to staying at hotels. Luckily, I had trouble finding a hotel room as it was graduation week for Wallace State (my daughter& her husband both graduated & I was so happy to be there to celebrate with them!)
Beth clearly cares that her guests have a lovely, comfortable home away from home during their stay. I look forward to staying here again."

Stayed with kids","My daughter and I were in Decatur for a four-day softball tournament and decided to rent this bungalow as opposed to a hotel and we are so happy we did. We arrived an hour early because we didn’t really know how long it was going to take us to drive to Decatur. Beth was so accommodating and allowed us to check in a little early with just a “short notice” request. We were a little concerned when we arrived because the house is located in an urban area (we are two women traveling together alone) but we felt very safe while we were there at the bungalow. The location is so convenient! We were 3 miles from Wilson Morgan Softball Complex. 1 mile from the nearest Walmart neighborhood market, gas stations, fast food, and restaurants. Also, Beth has mastered the art of “special touches”. From the laundry detergent to the travel size essentials you may have forgotten, the house has all you need for a few days stay. The added bonus was how adorable the home is decorated. I hope to stay here again for the next softball tournament in Decatur. One side note, there is not an ice maker in the fridge at the home so if this important to you as we LOVE ice in our drinks prepare to bring a cooler. Other than that it was PERFECT for a mom and daughter duo. (Dad did get to come later for a bit too)."

Stayed with a pet","The place was awesome, cute little couples getaway. Everything was clean, easy access. I am in a wheelchair and was able to get around inside the house really well. The only issues I personally had was the seat in the shower was nice it just had the shelf expanding out over the seat. Everything else in the bathroom was nice. My husband had to carry my wheelchair up the stairs to the porch. I am able to walk short distances so it worked for us. I only say this about the handicap issue so that the next handicap person knows what they may need to bring. Justin and his cohost were awesome. We booked for 3 nights, liked the place so well that we extended our stay an extra night and the transition was very easy. The home is even pet friendly, they had snacks for the dogs in there, food and water bowls, and even bags for poop pick up."

Frog Stomp was on several acres of well-marked wooded trails with plenty of gorgeous native plants. So peaceful and serene! The cottage itself was adorable and comfortable. I ended up spending less on my own private, dog-friendly cottage in beautiful surroundings than I would have spent on an urban hotel room on an asphalt jungle! I frequently travel from my home town of Cincinnati, Ohio to New Orleans on business. Frog Stomp is halfway between the two, and I plan to make this the first of many stays!"

We were very happy with the amenities and the peaceful wooded surroundings. As stated in the description, there are other airbnb's on the property so there may be other people within close proximity of the cabin as there were when we were there.

Stayed with a pet",We stopped to stay for the night as we traveled from Michigan to Florida with our 2 dogs. There was another family staying in the main house so the area wasn’t completely private but we had no issues with sharing the yard as it’s very large and some walkable trails for the dogs to stretch their legs. There were personal touches to the house to include muffins and eggs to help ourselves to. It was very peaceful and seen some tiny frogs and lightening bugs out in the evening. This was the perfect spot for us to stay with our dogs to rest up from a long drive.

It’s close enough to the metro area to be convenient but far enough away to be quiet and peaceful. If you’re going to the Wheeler NWR it’s especially convenient. I have stayed here several times and it’s always my first choice. This time, I needed to add an extra night literally at the last minute and they were so quick to respond and accommodate. I headed out this morning for birding with a yummy blueberry muffin and freshly boiled eggs from their chickens. Highly recommend!"

Stayed with a pet","Justin and Jessie need to write a manual on how to rent an abode. They thought of everything to make a short stay extremely comfortable. The binder of information was amazing. The little touches of shower soaps, clear ice, extra pillows, comfortable bed, fresh eggs, and huge blueberry muffins were amazing. I have to say the quarter stick of butter was so greatly appreciated.
This rental was a great place to unwind after a long day on the road. Love the front porch rocking chairs, very peaceful surroundings, and just the right amount of amenities for a relaxing evening before hitting the road again the next day with I65 being close by for easy access. Wish we could have stayed longer."

Stayed with a pet",Frog Stomp is such a cute little cottage. Our family of 3 stayed for a night on each way traveling to and from Florida. The cottage was perfect for us because we have 2 dogs and we were able to have a nice quiet place to sleep for the night. Hotels can be noisy and that is hard when dogs are staying with you. We enjoyed walking the trail through the woods with our dogs after our very long days in the car. The place was clean and comfy and we would recommend it to anyone. Our only issue was that we couldn’t stay longer. We will definitely try to stay again if we are traveling through again.

Stayed one night","The Frog Stomp House is WONDERFUL! Immaculate & charming. Perfect for our overnight stay on our way home from vacation. Delicious fresh muffins and farm fresh eggs were waiting upon our arrival! Keurig coffee maker and lots of pods provided the perfectbreakfast with the HUGE delicious muffins the next morning. Serene & quiet surroundings, comfortable bed and pillows were much appreciated. This cabin has everything you need: washer & dryer, spacious modern bathroom, kitchen, eating area and TV. The price is much better than area options and I promise you won't be disappointed! Justin communicated with us easily and his wife was kind and responsive as well. You are missing out if you don't stay here!"

Fresh eggs from the family chickens awaited us in the fridge along with homemade blueberry muffins!! The hosts were amazing!!

Stayed one night","We previously stayed here, and Stephanie has continuously enhanced the experience. The basic home is a wonder- beautiful floors that are well-polished, tin plate backdrops over the kitchen and the beds are comfy and posh!
The location is perfect for Decatur. The city is a vibrant river town with all sorts of activities that are within walking or driving distance. Family-owned restaurants and shops dot Highway 31, just a few streets away. The area has wonderful nature preserves, several parks, interesting architecture, and an easy pace. This location allows quick access and quick return.
Stephanie responds quickly, even going so far as to respond after-dark when I had some question appt amenities.
This small home has a big heart, with luxurious and functional appointments, room for us to “share” Christmas with our local grandkids, and a big front porch on which to enjoy a sunset, even a cold one!"

There were many food options nearby, which was super convenient, but our favorite was Currents, the adorable little coffee shop that’s open late and practically right behind their place. We got a late, tasty dinner from there when we arrived. The Airbnb was very spacious, and the beds were comfy! We pulled right up to the back door to unload, which was super convenient with having little ones and critters, plus all of their stuff. Getting into a hotel room would have not been nearly as easy as this was! This was very convenient and comfy and we would stay again if we pass through in the future!"

Stayed with a pet","This is a cute, old, two-bedroom house that has been completely remodeled - very nicely, I might add - with nice furnishings and everything we needed for a layover on our trip up I-65. It is a short and easy drive from the highway and in a mixed commercial / residential area that is convenient to shopping and restaurants yet quiet at night. There’s a train yard a few blocks away but we never heard any noise from it. The bed was really comfortable and we had a restful sleep. The single floor layout was perfect for our elderly pup who has started having trouble with mobility. We just helped her up the handful of stairs to the porch and she took it from there.
The owners were very accessible, responding quickly to our texts and they offered to help with any issues, though we had none."

They were very thoughtful in the things they provided like K cups for the keurig (if keurig is not your thing theres a great coffee shop literally out the door!) Also soaps and bodywashes if you forgot yours. Great communication and helpful suggestions for meals. I would love to see Whisk'd cafe added for a breakfast suggestion (everything we got there was great).
We did not do any cooking while we were there, as this was a quick overnight so we could hike in Bankhead, so i cannot speak on how the kitchen was stocked. There was sufficient seating in the living room for the 4 of us. But if youre planning on eating there, there was just a pub height table with 2 chairs for dining. Id also like to add the beds were both extremely comfortable!
Thank you again for sharing your lovely home with us!"

Stayed one night","The home is a jewel, and the tasteful upgrades really are nice. We loved the stay, and will stay again when we're in town: our son has a small cottage a few blocks east, so it was so convenient to restaurants and everything. We loved the wonderful mix of classic and new (the kitchen and bathroom fittings for example, and the old room keys!). It's just beautiful inside, and it was a cozy place for us to have the kids visit Sunday afternoon and celebrate Christmas. Our small dog went for walks outside and she loved the large clover-like ferns we walked through and all the greenery, so unlike many hotels. The furniture was comfy, and the front bedroom bed was just luxurious! Sam & Stephanie were just wonderful to set us up on short notice, too!
We hope to stay again every time we visit Decatur. The combination of historic architecture, simple elegance and comfort, and excellent price-point make this a wonderful option to hotels where it's more difficult to bring our family dog. Highly recommended, just bring your luggage and anything with which you'd stock the refrigerator. Sam & Stephanie have taken care of the rest."

Stayed a few nights",Cute house that has clearly been renovated recently and shows some signs of still being a work in progress. Stephanie was quick with information. Beds were comfy. Kitchen is not fully stocked so I would suggest seeing the couple of things there before doing a grocery run. There is a very strong cat urine oder throughout. No reaction from the person allergic to cat dander but the smell is very strong at times.

The house was super clean, stocked with all the necessities (plus a fab coffee bar and cold drinks in the fridge!) you can think of. The mattresses are very firm if this matters to you (not a complaint, but I like to know this info before booking) and there are plenty of pillows and blankets. We didn't have time to try the grill that was on the back patio, but it's a nice option. The house was convenient to the Princess Theater as well as local shopping and restaurants.

Being able to park our car in the garage was an added bonus. We greatly appreciated the complimentary sodas, water, coffee, and granola bars - especially after a long day of travel. I’m afraid it spoiled us a bit … we are now at our next Airbnb, and my husband is comparing it to Ahmad’s place. Ha! You cannot compare. :) Would definitely stay again. Thank you."

Stayed over a week","Ahmad’s home was super comfortable and pristine. My husband & I travel a lot. I’m a germ a phobia so I’m quick to start cleaning, but when I walked in I relaxed. I completely forgot to pull out the Clorox wipes that’s always my first job on move.
Absolutely thrilled to relax. This home provided us with a comfy environment of super soft blankets & pillows in every room. We stayed 2 weeks to care for my autistic brother who had surgery and required a relaxing place to recover. This was ideal. We were able to spread out in this beautiful home. Wonderful T.V.s in every room allowed for privacy to escape when needed.
Our stay was like we were in our own home. We loved the Outstanding decor and character in every room. Super nice that Ahmad spent the money necessary to provide quality amenities that gives one great respect and appreciation.
I have to mention the coffee bar is fabulous but this owner goes even further by stocking some snacks and drinks. Thankful ❤️"

Stayed with a pet","The cottage was immaculate, and the bed was really comfortable. It is a peaceful setting and a perfectly appointed little cottage studio. The owners have two labs that like to greet you when you drive in so I would drive slowly and look out for their warm greeting. The female will usually be carrying her ""baby"" around to show you. It's adorable. The sofa reclines so look for the pull cord on the side of the seat cushion. I didn't realize at first. I traveled solo and felt safe at all times. Since this is a rural setting there is no corner store but it's really only a short drive to pick up things you need. The tv in the living room is small so that would be my only suggestion to improve this perfect place although it's certainly no reason to not return. I hope to return. A note for anyone with heavy luggage there is no paved path to the cottage so you will have to roll luggage carefully. I'm an over packer so there's that. All in all I loved the cottage house."

I now know my next house has to have a covered porch as I never missed a day sitting out and enjoying all the wonderful sounds coming off the pond. It's the most relaxed I've been in awhile. Would gladly stay again should I ever return to the area."

During days when the scorching heat of August forced people inside for relief, sitting on the porch provided pleasant comfort in the mornings. Set in the shade of numerous trees, the porch offered gentle breezes to keep me cool as I sat in the quiet surrounding the Yellow House.
This hostess pays attention to every detail. This was definitely a wonderful experience as my very first stay at an Airbnb."

We came down for a festival filled weekend and had an absolute blast all weekend. Not only was the home affordable but it is also fully furnished with everything you could need, and some things that you forgot you needed. For example, when you come in from a late night with Huddle House to eat, and see they didn’t put ketchup in your bag. Open the fridge and waalaaa— there is your ketchup. Thank you Leah and Ben for allowing us to stay on your property! We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and are 100% sure where we will be staying next time we are in the area!"

The cottage is beautiful and so cozy and comfortable. Reeve's Peach Farm is a very nice place to visit that is close by the cottage. We also explored the Huntsville area during our stay at the cottage. We really enjoyed Monte Sano State Park and its beautiful overlook and the Hunstville Botanical Gardens were also very nice. Everything at the cottage was very clean and in good order at a great price. Book a stay at this one, it is fabulous!"

Stayed over a week","Over the past year I have been staying in Airbnb’s a month at time, while on a personal sabbatical. Looking to push my one month standard, I stayed at Leah and Ben’s cottage for four months. The cottage is cozy and charming, and provided the perfect relaxing lake view for lots of thinking and reading time. With the wood blinds pulled all the way up (which I highly recommend) it reminded of being on a houseboat. For a ‘kid’ that has spent most of his life in the suburbs I found the country life very appealing. Leah and Ben’s place offers a unique setting that is hard to duplicate. If the quiet country life is calling (which it def was me), Leah and Ben’s is an excellent place to answer that call. There’s even a couple of very friendly Labs that will be very excited to meet you."

Every morning you want to side on the porch that over looks the pond and drink coffee, taking in the quiet morning and nature stirring to life. I was able to see a great blue heron standing in the pond. The home was well supplied with plates, pans, flatware, and plenty of entertainment. Leah had a binder full of local restaurants, and local spots it check out. The cathedral cavern's caught me eye and worth the trip. Thank you Leah for the peaceful and quiet stay. If I'm ever back in Alabama, your place is where I'm staying."

We were there for little less than a week for a fishing tournament, the location is secluded yet close enough to places for food/groceries. Just have to highlight how clean it was (and I’ve stayed at many Airbnbs). Also I love natural light, and there were so many windows and it had wooden shutters so if you wanted absolute privacy it was one string pull away. Super neat spot, highly recommend to anyone looking for a place in the area."

Stayed with kids","This was the perfect place to stay for our son’s soccer tournament at Jack Allen Rec complex. The home is well decorated and stocked and was super clean. More than enough space plus some. Checkin/checkout were super easy. We
Loved having a garage to park the car in.
The only issue we had didn’t have anything to do with this property but rather the neighbor. They had dogs that barked loudly and for an extended period of time. One night around 4:30 am and one time around 12:30 am. Something to consider for light sleepers.
We can’t say enough great things about this home Or the host. It was super convenient for what we needed. The property is stocked with everything you needed and a lot of extra touches. For us in particular the snacks and bottled waters were a huge hit as we were there for very active sporting events and it was hot.
Would 100% recommend to anyone else looking for a place in the area."

Stayed with a pet","Sammy & Grace were as responsive as any host I have stayed with. We noticed the refrigerator wasn't cooling despite checking GFIs and plug. The maintenance man was literally at the door before i received a text from the Hosts saying he was on the way.
The on-suite bathroom was a bit smaller than expected, but the main bathroom was more than ample to handle our family.
Quiet neighborhood, but you must try Country Tacos; authentic mexican fare!!!"

We had three teenagers with us and between the games provided and the pool table they were never board. Our fur baby loved the HUGE yard to run around in! If it wasnt for the rain when we were there we would have enjoyed using the grill and fire pit. Next time. Instructions from the hosts were extremely detailed and easy to follow for checking in and out. Will for sure stay with them again!

Stayed one night","The home was beautifully decorated. However, it had spider webs all over the walls. It was pitch black (no lighting) to walk up to door to get in. The carpets were stained and dirty. It was three ladies staying there, we had a business meeting the next morning. We drove in straight from work and arrived at 1:30 in the morning. After a 8 hour drive, sadly we did not feel safe and didn’t feel like the home was clean. We left shortly after arrival (2 something in the morning) to find a hotel. We messaged the owners and were argued with that they didn’t have time to clean the carpets due to a quick turnaround (not our fault) and that the lights were indeed on outside when we arrived. I assure you they were not we had to use our lights on our phones to get to the front door. The owners refused money back, but offered one free night with a two night stay. We didn’t feel safe there the first time, I definitely will not go back. Also, this was a first time using Air BNB and it was a horrible experience."

If you’d like to go anywhere, you’d only have to drive for a couple of minutes, so the location is very convenient. If you have kids, this air bnb has a kids room with VERY comfortable beds, a table full of toys they can play with, and a baby carrier. The backyard is also huge, so they could also run around and play outside. You will never feel more at home than here, and I would love to come here again."

Stayed a few nights","The location is good, close to everything. It is like Fall right now there so the driveway was full of leaves and muck as well as the walkway to the backdoor. (A quick run of a leaf blower would of taken care of that). Upon arrival we were told we could check in early because of our flight arrival, than was nice but the cleaning person was there and would be til later in the day, odd. The bedrooms were nice, very comfy. No hand soap or tissues. The kitchen was satisfactory but no dish washer soap available. I don't mind hand washing but no dish drainer or dish sponges to wash with. I know you need mouse traps sometimes but NOT right on the kitchen counter. We couldn't get the heat or air to work so someone came out and the breaker was off outside.. not sure what was going on there.. so we tried to get the gas fireplace to turn on as stated in the description, and was told it isn't functioning right now. I don't think it has worked in a long time due to the several spider webs in the fireplace. In the evening I looked for an Xtra blanket in a hall closet found dirty damp towels and wash cloths. Pretty sure the cleaning person missed that... I looked for an extra towel and behold they were still in the dryer. I usually don't make a big deal about some things and yes I like to be a good host myself so these things bothered me. Bring your own ice too because non available with this fridge."

It was a clean and wonderful place for the out-of-town members of the family to stay, and it provided ample room for preparing and sharing meals and visiting with each other. The pool table and dart board are unusual and fun features. Communication with the hosts was both easy and very clear, and check in/out was super simple. No regrets! We’d absolutely stay here again!"

Group trip","This place is beautiful! Very spacious as well. Great proximity to the main things in town. It is a great value for the price. There is toys and books for the children and that was so great! There were a few things that I suggested to the hosts. Some i feel worth mentioning here JUST as a heads up (hopefully they fix some so just ask before going). There are sticky traps out for bugs and we saw bugs/baby roaches. So they know they are there, guests dont expect that and should be told or it should be remedied. There was no dust pan to sweep up anything that we needed. We swept anyway and wiped up pile with paper towels. Bring hand soap for kitchen and salt if you plan to cook. And you may want to bring more pots and pans, depending on what you are cooking. There is a cook set, and a some utensils. Knives, and can opener. Also bring ice as ice maker isnt hooked up. Had plenty of towels and such like that. There is a nice fenced in yard but no chairs or anything back there at all and you can move any furniture around. Overall is agood place but if they tweaked thiese issues it would be most excellent!"

We had a woman asking us for money when trying to park and go inside the first night. There was a dead mouse in the cupboard but not in a trap. Just dead. Dead bugs in windowsill. Dirty shower.
Decorated cute but very warped and old home. The mattress topper in master bedroom made the bed very comfortable though."

We had easy access to good restaurants, yet still maintained the calm and privacy of a good neighborhood. The inside of the house was pristine, with all of the amenities one could ask for. Even the details of laundry detergent, shampoo/conditioner, creamer/sugar, and ice were provided. The beds and towels were fresh and comfortable, plenty of hot water, and good water pressure in the shower. We stayed for several days, so there was ample room to unpack our clothes and belongings and stay organized (something I really appreciate). We would absolutely seek this place out for a future stay.

We loved that there were two dog crates with blankets and water bowls already set up, which really helped us with our two pups. The coffee bar was wonderful, and the cold drinks in the fridge were a nice and appreciated surprise. Ahmad is wonderful with communication and seems like such a good person. Please read his bio. We love what he is accomplishing for his family! We were so spoiled by his nice home, that the next stop on our trip, though also nice, wasn’t as nice as his place. Haha!

Stayed with a pet","Ahmad was an OUTSTANDING host and by far the most responsive in our experience. The house was very comfy and had everything we needed and then some. It’s a great place for families with plenty of space. The accommodations for pets was above expectations and there is even a little bit to entertain younger kids if you have them. VERY CLEAN and organized and overall a very relaxing stay. The back yard was very relaxing and spacious. Location was not bad either…surrounding area was nice, quiet neighborhood and roughly 25-30 min from Huntsville, the Space and Rocket Center, and other downtown attractions. Too bad it was only 1 night, but we’d definitely be back again!"

Stayed with a pet","Perfect location and just off the beaten path. It felt like we walked into ""home"" which is always a great thing. Extra care was taken with details such as kitchen setup, extra blankets and it was so spacious! Loved the backporch and early morning coffee with the birds and flowers! Super clean, a great price point for families with multiple children and convenient location. We felt safe during our entire stay and Ahmad was very responsive and accommodating. Will definitely stay again!"

Stayed with a pet","Ahmad’s house was absolutely perfect for me and my family’s weekend in Decatur! The location was great. You can tell that he takes pride in the space that he has, and wants his guests to be very comfortable. There were plenty of linens, towels, kitchen accessories that we needed, and the extra touches of coffee, snacks, and drinks were especially appreciated! I would highly recommend Ahmad’s place to anyone, and we plan to stay here again next year when we are in town. Great all around experience!"

Stayed with kids","The house was in a great location! Had an awesome fenced in backyard for the kids and dogs! Plenty of room for the 7 of us that were staying there! Enjoyed the screened in porch for visiting. The BBQ grill worked awesome for us as well! Plenty of parking, as we had a truck with a boat and another vehicle with us! The only con would be in the kitchen, there are not many utensils in the kitchen to use or many pots and pans or containers. Also you would need seasonings or condiments! Other than that, it was great and we plan to return!"

Stayed with kids","This home exceeded our expectations! The host was easy to get in contact with and the property was in great condition. It’s an older house, but very well kept. It was the perfect place for having our kids with us! We didn’t have our dog with us, but it was set up perfectly for that as well! The kids enjoyed playing in the fenced in back yard and with the legos in the room. The little extra touches-such as coffee, water bottles, and granola bars were appreciated! The beds were also comfortable, and plenty of towels were available. We have no complaints! If we need a place to stay in Decatur again, we will remember this one!"

Stayed with a pet","Ahmad’s place felt like staying at family’s house! The house is clean as a whistle & spacious with uplifting decor. Both the house and neighborhood were family friendly; our little one loved the toys provided and snack options so we were very grateful for that touch. The location of the home is surprisingly close to most things in town. The screened in back porch was a huge hit for us. Ahmad is a beyond accommodating host, from giving helpful local barbecue recommendations when we asked, to the very thoughtful touches in the house. We were blessed by our stay here at Ahmad’s house while we visited Decatur. So inviting, so clean & comfy."

Stayed one night","Ahmad’s place was quiet a serene, very homely, thoughtful touches and decors, looks like he went out of the way to maintain. The space squeaky clean. Very comfortable bed. The backyard and screened back porch is very relaxing, I loved the outdoor dove setting. Looks like it can comfortably accommodate company for retreat. Close to point mallard park and downtown Decatur. I would definitely look to book again"

Stayed with a pet","Highly recommend. Check in was easy. Seemed very clean. Lots of thoughtful touches. Snacks, coffee, drinks. The fenced yard was perfect for our pups. They needed a good romp after a long road trip and it was safe and large. He even had two crates available for our dogs to use which we didn’t expect and saved us from having to unload ours. Location seemed convenient for food options. Lots of sleeping options. Ahmad was a great communicator. We did experience any crazy pet fees and he didn’t have a list of crazy cleaning needs. Literally said the cleaning crew would take care of everything. Can’t remember the last Airbnb where that happened. 10/10 experience."

Ahmad had a great set up in the kitchen complete with snacks and beverages that made it easy to unpack, relax and worry about grocery shopping the next day.

Stayed with a pet","This house is set up perfectly for a family with kids and pets. It has a distinctive homey feel to it, and many of our family members commented on how much they liked it. The house was well stocked with towels and linens, and complimentary drinks and coffee/tea. Also very clean which I greatly appreciate. I had one area I thought it lacked it which was the lack of kitchen items like sait:pepper (basic supplies) and really items if you wanted to cook. Other than that it was great!"

Stayed with a pet","We had a wonderful time. Long stay - almost three months. You have everything you needed - inside the home.
Big rooms, very comfortable mattresses .... nice kitchen with everything you need to cook your own meal , patio and fenced backyard that provided us with privacy and safety for our little dog.
Nice neighbourhood - quiet - beautifull big - old trees.
Very decent and fair price that I appreciated very much so - compared to the majority of airbnb owners that overcharged for their homes.
Ahmad is very nice person and responds very fast to your messages - if you need him.
We enjoyed our stay. We felt very comfortable. I do recomend this place - very much so."
