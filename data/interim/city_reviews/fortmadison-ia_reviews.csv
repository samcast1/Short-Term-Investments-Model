Stayed a few nights",Enjoyed my stay greatly. Was in town visiting family for the holidays so didn’t spend much time there but it was comfortable and interesting when I did. Loved the choices of furniture and furnishings and the space was nicely decorated for the Christmas holiday. Access to the space is up a large flight of stairs so it wouldn’t work for anyone with mobility issues. Great exercise for me though! I’m sure I will be back to stay again. Thanks Kumar!

The location is perfect as well!
Kumar went above and beyond as a host. He is quick to respond and is not only professional, but very friendly and welcoming! We will definitely stay again when in the Fort Madison area!"

Stayed a few nights","We stayed here for the Tri-State Rodeo (4 nights). It was a perfect location for us. We loved having this apartment all to ourselves and the extra room that you don’t get with a hotel stay. Everything was as described and the attention to details made it even better. Providing little extras we didn’t expect made our stay even more enjoyable! The beds and furniture were comfortable, the kitchen was cute and well stocked, the layout suited our needs, and the view of the Mississippi River and trains were an added bonus. There wouldn’t be one thing I’d change. Kumar was a perfect host! Very prompt with responses and extremely friendly when we met him in person. I highly recommend this property no matter what the reasons for visiting Ft. Madison are. I’m crossing my fingers we get to return sometime soon! Thank you for sharing your home. Well wishes to you and your family!"

Stayed a few nights","We absolutely loved our stay! They went well above and beyond any hosts we have stayed with! We were welcomed with a thank you card and cookies, the fridge was well stocked with the necessities (not at all expected, but so beneficial), they had an excess of toiletries for us to use if needed, and they even went as far as to provide some basic medications (DayQuil, NyQuil, ibuprofen) for the unexpected complications that sometimes come. Truly fantastic hosts, with the most stunning accommodations! This place is amazing! Don’t hesitate to book!"

Stayed one night","Excellent Airbnb. The location and house are simple and unassuming, but the inside is elegantly decorated and very comfortable. I especially appreciated the comfortable bed and pillow, and the towels. And the carpet is amazing luxurious!!! I was grateful that the location was a little further from the train than others. In fact, the expensive hotel is right next to the train station and they hear the train horn all day and night. But in Jon’s location, it’s a gentle faraway sound. Check-in was super easy, and Jon was remarkably responsive, replying in less than a minute! And he was very flexible when I made a mistake with my reservation. I highly recommend Jon’s property."

The home is quaint and decorated nicely and would be perfect for a couple’s getaway or a place to have a get together with board games and record player and also karaoke and books to read. The neighborhood is safe and near a park and down the road from restaurants and grocery store. It was clean and smelled nice. Tabetha was very responsive and let me check in early which I really appreciated! Price is also very fair! 10/10 recommend!

My kids loved the karaoke machine, record player, board games, and coloring book. The house was very clean and the host was very clear with her instructions. The only complaint is I wish there was more sleeping space. The daybed on the porch was a bit chilly for December so our 2 kids slept on the couch and the air mattress. We knew this from the description before booking and it worked just fine for us, just wish there could somehow be a little more space! :) Thanks for the great stay!"

Stayed about a week","We chose Fleetwood Inn for our combined anniversary trip and writing retreat. Our decision was based on location, price, and the fact that it had an actual dedicated workspace, unlike some listings that claim this and you have a dining table and hard wooden chair. This place had 2 desks, making it perfect.
The space was so comfortable, making it possible to get good rest and stay productive. The living room was nice and cozy with lamps and throws. The desks were great, with comfortable chairs. I loved the fully furnished kitchen, making it easy to cook on our extended stay.
A day or so after we arrived, Tabetha checked in with us via text to see if all was well.
Thank you for giving us a comfortable space to (almost) finish our books!"

The home is so quaint with its original floors and built-ins, but it also has the benefit of some amazing decorating. I felt like I was back in the 70s with the (somewhat) hippy decor and a functional turntable! I grew up in the area and have lots of family nearby, so it was nice to be able to host my siblings for some wonderful late-night talks around the intimate dining table.
I would definitely stay at the Fleetwood Inn again!"

Stayed a few nights","I had a great stay with Melissa! She was kind and thoughtful and had great communication. One thing I feel obligated to mention is that there is a house rule posted in the apartment (but not on here) that threatens a $200 fine and/or eviction for having food or beverages anywhere other than the kitchen. If enjoying a coffee on the couch - or eating the supplied popcorn while watching a movie - is important to you, this may not be a great fit. There is a table in the kitchen to eat at. Having said that, everything else was great."

Stayed a few nights","Nice place to stay if in the Ft. Madison area. The place was very clean with all the things you would like to have when you check in. The only downside was with the large air conditioning unit in the bedroom that actually put off more heat in the room than cool air. I got a better night sleep with the unit off. Not sure why it ran so hot. The living room was cool and a very nice place to relax. I didn't get a chance to work out so I didn't use the Boflex machine. The only complaint about check in was that I was never notified from Airbnb with the code for entry when 5pm rolled around. They contact me for everything but never did at 5pm when I was waiting to check in.
Ft. Madison is a great place if you are a train enthusiast. Only a little over a mile from the depot."

As expected, the place was in pristine condition, but David has thought of all the little extra details that make a stay more enjoyable! We rested very well on the very comfortable bed, were grateful for tons of extra towels and blankets. We enjoyed the essential oil diffuser, the foosball table and the great assortment of tv channels and movies. We appreciated the large assortment of coffee, tea and snack items. The view was breathtaking! My husband was able to work remotely with the super-fast wifi. When we are in the area again we will not hesitate to book again!"

The view of the sunrise over the Mississippi river were incredible from the family room area as well as the outdoor sitting area.
Seriously, they thought of every amenity to make our stay comfortable!!!
Thank you, we will stay again when visiting our family in Keokuk.

It is quite steep preventing many vehicle traffic in winter weather. Also they have dogs. If you aren’t a dog person you should look elsewhere. Very nice! Would definitely stay again! Loved it!"

Stayed with a pet","David was very nice and his place was just what we needed. The location was stunning! (Mississippi River just across the street). We were a bit taken aback at the amount of noise we initially heard above us (footsteps) when we first arrived, but this issue quickly abated after about 30 minutes, or less and was never heard again for the rest of our stay. The place was quiet, clean and had plenty of movies (DVDs) to choose from along with what looked like a fantastic sound system (we never ended up using it). Outside of a microwave there was no other kitchen appliance that could heat/cook food which was not mentioned in the “About this space.” The closest restaurant was several miles away, so we were very grateful that we brought our own food. Our puppy loved the yard and patio! The queen bed was very comfortable, however, we did have issues with the air purifier we were using for white noise (a strange buzzing woke us up around 2 am and I couldn’t figure out where it was emanating from)"

The place is so nice and relaxing for adults, with a beautiful river view, but also fun for the kids with a PS3 gaming system, a foosball table that brought lots of fun for all of us, a large cabinet full of family board/card games, and hundreds of movies to choose from with theatre surround sound and a comfy couch (complete with popcorn and hot chocolate or coffee provided by the hosts, which is so thoughtful of them). The main bedroom was so cozy and comfortable, complete with a ceiling fan (I love a ceiling fan to sleep to). The other bedroom has 4 twin beds which was great for kids, they loved that space! We actually spent more time hanging out at the house than we thought we would just because it was so nice and offered us so much entertainment. Definitely received FIVE STARS from us AND it will be a place we come back to again for sure! :) Thanks David!"

Stayed a few nights","We found this location to be perfect while visiting the Keokuk and surrounding areas. The Tree of Life guest suite is amazing. we spent many hours on patio overlooking the River...so very peaceful. The hummingbirds visited everyday and evening. The suite is well stocked with snacks, coffee and teas, along with complimentary water. There are enough games, movies and books if you want to make your visit a soulful retreat. Honestly, we could have chilled right there all day and been so content. We were traveling on thru to northern MN so hauled our motorcycle and trailer and David and Tammy worked with us to park on their property. The road up to their home is rocked and steep and recommended for very experienced riders. We will definitely stay here again when in the area. Comfortable beds, immaculate home, lots of perks, and great communication by the hosts."

The living area and bar area were very nice with a fancy home theater system and foosball table. There are so many movies available to choose from!

Would definitely return to stay here if we travel to the area again. Thanks!"

The sunrise view was spectacular. My wife loved being able to do some early-morning yoga facing the river. I loved being able to run 10K out and back along the bank of the Mississippi at sunrise (it's roughly 3 miles straight south into historic Keokuk). My kids were fascinated by the river frogs. If we're ever back in the area, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.
While you're here, make sure you check out ""The Lost Canvas Coffee"" in Keokuk - truly a local gem! Also visit ""Stan's Pastry Shop,"" which is just up the block from Lost Canvas - amazing donuts, and surprisingly inexpensive!"

We visit Keokuk for rock hunting so we haven't spent much time in town . Dr Getwells is a great place for dinner. We can't wait to come back and would recommend this home for you and your family to stay in a million times over.

The outside gardens are gorgeous and the backyard has a view of the Mississippi. There are two parks for kids to play within 5 minutes. The hosts were extremely gracious, allowing us to drop our stuff off early and head over to Nauvoo for an evening show. The guest area is clean with plenty of beds and lots of games, books, foosball table, and huge couch and entertainment system.
Wifi was available and worked for everything but video calls. Cell service was spotty for us, but good enough for texts. The only downside is the kitchen area is just a wet bar. They provided plenty of disposable and washable dishes and snacks! There was a hot water kettle, mini fridge, microwave, and small sink. Just don't plan to cook any big meals and you'll have everything you need."

There is a huge backyard, with views of river MIssissipi and it is really good. Only thing to consider for family with kids is that there is non provision for a gas/stove or electric heater, so you have to plan for 3 meal a day . There are not too many options around in local Keokuk apart from an Italian restaurant Angelini's . We travelled 22 miles to have dinner at a Japanese place - Simple Table by Hitomi. So plan your meals accordingly . Otherwise the place iis a steal !!!"

There’s a private entrance and designated parking area. It all feels very secluded and peaceful. Our family was visiting nearby sites at Nauvoo, IL so we didn’t spend a lot of time hanging out. But we played some games and watched a movie. Had a great time. The wifi connection wasn’t great, but they mentioned that in advance, so we expected it and it wasn’t a big deal for us.

Otherwise, conveniences like snacks and coffee were provided which was really nice!"

Stayed over a week","I highly, highly recommend staying with David and Tammy. I was stationed in Keokuk for over 2 months for work. We have had very early mornings and late nigh, and this place was a much appreciated retreat from work. If you are an early riser, grab a coffee and watch the sunrise over the river--it is beautiful. I can't speak about the twin beds, but the queen bed was very comfortable. When staying during the cold winter months, the gas fireplace and the bathroom heater were a welcome treat. There are more movies, games, and books than you could ever get through, so you won't be bored. I wasn't able to enjoy the yard much in the winter, but it is huge and also beautiful. There is a small kitchenette area and a well stocked pantry with granola bars, coffee, hot chocolate, etc. Unfortunately, my work schedule and Covid meant that I didn't get to know David and Tammy as well as I could have, but they were very accommodating and attentive hosts. Again, I would highly recommend staying here."

And for rail fans this is a must stay for any Midwest road trip. A mainline crossing over the Mississippi for BSNF there is a never ending parade of traffic to watch with front row seats. Definitely a stopover for my future road trips. For non rail fans traveling with children they will be thrilled with this Thomas the Tank Engine adventure come to life."

Stayed a few nights","A+ Rebecca's apartment was clean w/ a wide open floor plan. The Murphy bed was comfortable w/ plenty of pillows. I was there during the hottest part of the year and even though they had central air conditioning, they also had a window unit that kept the apartment very comfortable and kept the noise of the trains at bay. She offers ear plugs, but they weren't necessary. The kitchen is well equipped. My grandkids, 5 and 8, said it was the best sleep over ever!!! The t.v. has lots of options and was easy to use. The bathroom is large and the shower has good water pressure. There was no shampoo or soap, and I had not brought any with me on the plane, so I went to Walgreens and bought some travel sizes. The bathroom is large enough to accommodate a table to set a travel bag/clothing on, as there is no room on the small single basin sink. Rebecca was receptive to suggestions of a table and soaps for future tenants. I will be staying here again at future family visits."

Stayed a few nights","This Studio is the perfect stay for any railfans, and non-railfans. The high ceilings with large windows provide a great view of the railroad station, park, river and trains. You can pull up a chair and watch trains all day through the windows, enjoy the view from the lawn chairs in the courtyard, or take a short walk to the train station.
For non-railfans, the brick facade and new windows block most of the sound so you shouldn't be bothered by outside noise. We barely noticed the trains and traffic for the majority of the stay.
The place is also conveniently located near the downtown area with access to several restaurants, grocery stores and small town shopping. Rebecca responded to all our messages within minutes and was very accommodating to our needs. The space was well stocked with everything we needed.
The Studio is on the second floor and is accessed via stairs. There is no elevator. For us this was fine, but could be an issue for others.
We had a great stay and would recommend this place to anyone."

I'm a light sleeper and had no problems. The bathroom is roomy with a shower that could easily fit two people.
Last, and most important, is Rebecca herself. She did a great job communicating back and forth with me. While I didn't need anything during my stay, I knew she'd take care of any issues that might of come up. The perfect host."

Group trip","Kim’s space was very clean with two bedrooms and a bathroom. The bedrooms had large beds, at least Queens, maybe Kings in both rooms. There were two pull out/convertible bed-couches that could accommodate two people per couch as well. The beds were made with clean sheets and plenty of pillows. The pull out couches had sheets and pillows available in storage. The bathroom was stocked with toilet paper, shampoo and conditioner and body wash. There were plenty of towels for all of us for showering and hand towels and face towels as well. The kitchen was very clean with flatware and silverware and essential seasonings for cooking. The Airbnb had a brand new deck out back with a breath taking view of the Mississippi River. Awesome spot to visit and I would highly recommend! Thank you, Kim!!
One thing I want to add is that in the house there were off limits type areas- one was a room off of one of the bedrooms with a keypad to enter, and stairs up to an attic with off limits notes on them."

Stayed a few nights","I was looking for a quiet haven, to 'catch my breath' prior to a surgery.
After okaying an early check-in for me, I easily found this mint green cottage, nestled in green grass, a blooming tree & a blueblue sky. I saw an eagle defending its catch, a fox dashing thru a field, birdsong everywhere - it was spectacular. I enjoyed it so much, I asked to stay another night & Kim graciously worked it out with me.
Recommend without reservation - for smaller groups (1-5) -
Give yourself a break ~ go to the river for a few days"

Stayed with kids","If you are looking for a peaceful, quiet retreat with about the best scenery, this is the place. Be aware, this is rural and along the Mississippi, which I would say is totally awesome. The down side is there are bugs-nothing too disturbing. While the house is older, it is definitely neat and tidy. The washer/dryer are a total plus. At this point, the kitchen has just the very basic of necessities, although it did have enough plates, cups, and silverware for our party of 8. Outside amenities are awesome-gas grill (used it and it worked great), fire pit with wood, and gas fire pit (used it and it worked great). If you've got any questions about what the house has, message Kim because she is ultra responsive. Lastly, nothing can beat the view here! We spent a lot of time just sitting out on the deck, watching the river and wildlife. Thanks Kim for giving us a place to create family memories to last a lifetime!"

We came to this area of Illinois to visit Nauvoo, and though it was a short drive to nauvoo, we loved being out of the way and in the quiet, beautiful neighborhood Kim’s house is in.

Stayed with kids","beautiful view. one night we just sat and watched the river by the fire on the deck. very peaceful. the area seemed a little sketchy driving to the house at night, but in the daytime didn't seem to bad and it is rural Illinois so can't complain. we were not bothered by the train at all as someone else mentions. it is pretty far away. inside was very clean, beds were comfortable... the pullout couch beds are uncomfortable as expected. we had a blow up mattress so used that instead haha. there is no dishwasher, so we kinda wished there was at least a disposal, but we knew that going in also, so no suprise. overall great place to stay when our family visited nauvoo. the new deck and view of the river really set this apart."

Turtles, fish, frogs, geese, squirrels, ducks, deer, and birds of many feathers, barges, boats, and mighty friendly neighbors as well! Highly recommend you build a fire and stay awhile!!

It was clean and comfortable with well thought out amenities. The bed was very comfy. We spent wonderful evenings that we will treasure on the lovely patio with the fire pit watching the barges and the birds, squirrels, turtles, geese, jumping fish and seeing our first fireflies. The neighborhood has many well kept quaint homes and travel RVs but is a bit colorful also having some boarded up or unkempt homes and trailers. There is a train that is far enough away as to not be excessively loud but runs frequently day and night. It didn't bother us but be aware if you are extra sensitive to noise."

The place was nice, but keep in mind it is a farm home, so not top of the line, but it was perfect for what we wanted. Parking is a little tricky when a certain vehicle needed out early or first. (we had 5!)
The house was clean and fully equipped with kitchen and bathroom items, and the mattresses we used were firm and comfortable.
Jordan worked with our schedule and we really appreciated that!
We would stay again, and would recommend!"

Home was spacious and slept all 7 of us with ease with beds to spare. 2 bathrooms were helpful.
Appliances were great. Well equipped kitchen and bathrooms, with toiletries supplied.
We all loved the old school Nintendo and enjoyed challenging each other.
Check out instructions were clear and easy to follow.
This was everyone's fave place to stay so far on our travels.

It was comfortable, plenty of beds and a lot of extra things including 2 pack and plays, crock pot and an infant table seat. It was close enough and far enough for plenty of privacy but not too far. It was also close to another city with more options than Nauvoo. We came and it was over 90 degrees with high humidity. The a/c had a little bit of a hard time keeping up but there were plenty of fans to help out. Rooms are a little small but they are set up well. Each room has a small dresser. I liked that their rules were simple and their check out instructions were easy to follow. Overall great place!"

Stayed with kids","Overall we had a good stay. Honestly I had to warm up to the place. But it grew on me. Part if it may have been that we had just come from an immaculate airbnb in Iowa, and this felt like a step down. We enjoyed the living and dining area, kitchen was fine, grateful for laundry. Kids liked Super Nintendo and 2 tweens loved the loft areas. Country location was nice and very close to Fort Madison for groceries.
Negatives:
Several outlets didn't work; we discovered wiring errors but talked with host who promised to repair.
Musty, dusty smell in bedroom off dining area. I couldn't get it to air out and couldn't sleep in there though it was supposed to be my room.
Master bedroom slopes downward, and since the bed is against the far wall you sleep with your head slightly downhill. Also creates tripping hazard into bathroom.
I grew up in old farmhouse, so used to vintage and country; in my opinion the whole place needs a deep clean.
Killed several bugs: spiders, ants, cockroaches."

Stayed with kids","When we first arrived there was no power to the house due to a large storm. Jordan got us a couple flashlights and a lantern to use for the night and offered a refund if the power remained off and we chose to go elsewhere. Luckily, the power came back on the next day and we were able to complete our stay! Jordan even gave us a discount for the first night due to the inconvenience. It was a cute home with plenty of room for my sister’s family and my family to stay comfortably. There are two large steps from the living room and two bunk rooms up to the kitchen/dining and bathrooms so we had to adjust sleeping arrangements for my elderly mother to be closer to the bathrooms without having to navigate the steps. Jordan was very responsive with any issues we had and there was everything you might need easily available and accessible in the home. We cooked our meals and ate around the large dining table. It was a quick, easy drive into Nauvoo to all the historical sites. Great stay!!"

A little outside of town but close enough that it doesn't take any time to get to what you are actually there to see. We arrived, literally minutes after a tornado blew through town. Knocked the power out to the entire region. Jordan went out to the house and checked everything before we arrived. He called and let us know the power was out but the house was okay. Kept us up to date on the restoration of the power and made sure we had what we needed until the power was restored. After power was back on everything was great. Kids player a little old school game console and puzzles. They had a few board games as well. Plenty of dishes for everyone as well."

It needs a deep spring cleaning. Window sills were dirty and had bugs on them. Kitchen cabinets are dingy looking and dusty. Now that there is nicer weather, cleaning off the benches on the front porch would have been helpful so I could have sat and had a cup of coffee on the porch. I understand wanting to keep cleaning costs down but I had to make beds up for my kids and strip beds too. Just a lot when we traveled to attend a funeral and had to be out at a certain time. Overall, it was a helpful find on short notice. Just needs a little more TLC."

It was also a little further than we realized, requiring a 10 minute drive through corn fields. Just make sure you triple check that the location works for your group."

Stayed with kids","This house is adorable, family friendly and cozy. Out in the middle of no where with a big yard and lots of room to hang out. The beds were very comfortable and the feeling in the house was so homey. I’ve never stayed somewhere away from home that felt so comfortable and “homey”. The kitchen table is huge! Four bedrooms and two full baths. Living room is very big and has two couches to hang out in.
Not many amenities, so bring everything you need. We did appreciate the shampoo and body wash that was available, as well as utensils for cooking. We were able to make all our own meals.
The location is pretty far away from anything. We loved being away from busyness, but if you’re looking for places to go know that there’s not much conveniently close. Nauvoo has a couple small places to eat and the tourist locations. Fort Madison doesn’t have many options, but has a lot more than Nauvoo - however, you have to pay a $2 toll to get back to the house. Burlington is only 1/2 hour away (same $2 toll to go there) and offered lots of things to do and places to eat.
Would highly recommend this home for a get away to be in a quiet space, and/or have a big group to house. This house was more than enough for the price!!"

Group trip",The dinning room and living room area are spacious. The sleeping bed spaces were as expected however there is limited spots available to hold luggage or bags in the rooms. The temperature gauge looked new but would fluctuate 4-5 degrees which was an annoyance. A little difficulty with the driveway and adjusting the shower temperatures. The price was right even though it was a 15 minute drive on rough roads to get to Nauvoo.

Jordan was a great host and always a quick response. A storm the night before we arrived blew out the router (which he communicated) and Jordan came out personally and hooked up an old router so we at least had spotty internet during our stay. This place is about 15 min. away from Nauvoo, but worth the drive."

Would be happy to stay there again. Only warning: Both showers need the mixing valves repaired/replaced; they currently offer 2 temps: scalding & cold, with minutes of fiddling needed to get anything in-between. Those were painful (literally); everything else about the place was fantastic!"

Stayed with kids","As soon as we set foot in this house, we wanted to come back again! Our kids were thrilled with the lofts and bunk-beds. I loved the cute porch and country cottage feel. Our children saw fireflies for the first time, a highly anticipated event. Kitchen was clean and functional, well-stocked with dishes for kids and adults. I used the laundry facilities with no problem. My only unfulfilled wishes would have been for it to be a bit closer to Historic Nauvoo (but considering how great the house is, 10 min drive isn't so bad), and slightly better water pressure. We will definitely be back, and hopefully bring more family with us, as the 3 acre lot lends itsself to tent-sleeping for family reunions. Thank you, Jordan, for providing the highlight of our short visit to Nauvoo!"

The bed was quite comfortable (we only used one of the bedrooms). A nice selection of beverages and snacks. Christopher was very easy to communicate with. For years when we returned to Burlington, we stayed in one of the large hotels in town so we could invite our small nieces and nephews over to swim--they are all older now and we will never go back!

The building feels grand and stately and the modern renovations beautifully blend the past with the present. The kitchen was bold and pristine. The master bedroom was large and inviting while the bunkbeds in the second bedroom were a smash hit with our kiddo. Christopher was a wonderful, proactive host, calling us the morning of our scheduled check-in to ensure we had all the necessary information regarding house entry, cleaners, etc. When we make future trips back to Burlington to visit family and friends, this place will most certainly be tops on our list for places to stay."

The bunk beds are spacious, so it was almost a bit of a bummer we didn't put them to use. The hosts were great and super responsive; if we come back, we'll definitely stay here again. Importantly, the primary bed mattress was very comfortable and huge. 10/10 :)"

the host was super helpful, texting us that he was available by phone if needed. they also left a few recommendations for places to eat nearby which we used.
we were able to bring our dog, which is something we always appreciate, and the nearness to downtown allowed us to walk him down to some of the recommended eateries.
Note that there was so washclothes so bring your own, but all other linens were provided and cleaner than any other hotel or ABnB I've ever been too!

I guess I didn’t really pay too much attention into what it looked like as I just read the reviews and knew it’d be good…but seeing it in person was just.. wow!! This Airbnb checks all the boxes…. Location was great, spacious, super clean, decorated and styled up amazingly… it was funky, fresh, and creative. The shower had perfect water pressure… the kitchen had everything that one would need..and the recommendations of nearby sports were great. I’d definitely go back !"

My wife came with me this time and loved all of the design elements and we both felt at home, as we worked from here for a few days. Would stay again if still available when we need to go back next year. Thanks!"

Stayed a few nights","We recently had the pleasure of staying at a charming Boho loft-style Airbnb the peacock loft in Burlington, Iowa, and it was an absolute delight. From the moment we stepped through the door, we were captivated by the unique blend of Bohemian and industrial design elements that created a warm and inviting atmosphere.
The loft was impeccably clean and beautifully decorated, with an abundance of plants, eclectic artwork, and cozy textiles that gave it a distinct Boho vibe. The open-concept layout made the space feel incredibly spacious, and the large windows allowed for plenty of natural light to flood in.
The bedroom was a true haven of relaxation, with a comfortable queen-size bed adorned with plush linens and an array of colorful throw pillows. The combination of exposed brick walls and dreamy light fixtures created a cozy and dreamy ambiance that made it hard to leave each morning. Our stay was such a delightful and memorable experience!"

we didn't use the kitchen or shower but both looked lovely.
definitely a ""magazine worthy"" apartment.
super quiet space- never heard a sound.
a quick drive to restaurants (or a 15ish minute walk).

As someone who likes to play with photography and fashion, it was fun to take breaks on work to “play”. I especially enjoyed all the coats that can be used as props. Don’t worry about time of day or lighting. The Peacock Loft as great picture worthy vibes morning, noon, and night!
I also loved all of the extras including the record player and books. Jamming out to some chill music or lounging on the big comfy couch with an inspiring book was just what I needed.
I took a few of Brandy’s recommendations and checked out some shops. I loved Original Cyns and Beancounter Coffee. I had brought my own meals as I eat AIP/Paleo (gluten, dairy, grain free) but I’m positive I could have gotten a fresh clean meal close by. Definitely will continue to come back!"

Stayed a few nights","Amazing loft, artsy and yet cozy and warm. Perfect for hanging out and feeling relaxed as well as inspired. The town of Burlington is in the process of transformation and desperately needs revitalization.
The area where the loft is located felt old and tired and in much need of some care and vibrancy. The feeling is that the residents accept the decline and can’t find a way to fight back and regain their community.
We never felt unsafe, but the loft was definitely an unexpected gem in the middle of a neighborhood in decline. But we took a chance and loved it. The downtown area had little stores, coffee shops, restaurants and an art center, plenty to check out on a weekend. All the places we ate were great.
Overall we had an awesome time and we hope that the Peacock Loft is part of a renaissance for this town of long history."

Stayed with a pet","Staying at Brandi’s loft was fantastic! It was open, clean, the design was amazing, and there were so many amenities. We will definitely be back to stay when we want an overnight in Burlington. The bed is incredibly comfy and so is the couch.
A few things to note:
- the stairs are steep and there is a bit of an angle at the top
- our dogs did okay but you do need to go slow
- I found it easier to leave the top door open when we went out for quick bathroom breaks so they didn’t lose momentum as the landing is on the smaller side
- it was raining so they did get a little slippery, but the railing is very sturdy
- there isn’t a ton of room for your dogs to easily go to the bathroom right outside the door, but we just walked across the street and up for less than 5 minutes to the park
- the street is used/can be busy but not “city” busy
- there is roadwork happening so it can be sort of loud if you’re a light sleeper, but we didn’t find any issues with this"

Stayed a few nights","The Peacock Loft was simply amazing! I haven’t been to Burlington (and SE Iowa in general) in many years so when I planned the trip I was surprised to see such a great place right in the center of Burlington.
The decor is really nice and there is SO much space! Brandy has lots of amenities in the place and there is a fun but comfortable vibe there. The pictures are very accurate and the location is really close to everything. Checking in and out was super easy and Brandy was very responsive. Wifi was very good, I had to connect my work laptop once for a video conference and it was perfect. And off-street parking was available.
Downtown Burlington has so many interesting local shops and restaurants (Weird Harold’s records, The Som, Bean Counter Coffee…) as well as a beautiful riverfront and Snake Alley! I was there early in the week but it appears more happens downtown Thursday-Saturday.
Highly recommend and can’t wait to return!!!"

We’ve stayed at other Airbnb’s that our friends have chose but this is our first Airbnb we’ve rented and it exceeded all the others we’ve ever been to. Even one’s down here in FL!!! 😁 The attention to detail was awesome, even down to the littlest things you may not think you need on your stay. Loved the vibes!

The city of Burlington also offers fun places to go. And has an interesting history. There is a guide book in the loft that has lots of info about what to do and where to go.

Loved, loved, loved the location on the Mississippi! We couldn’t stop watching it and taking pictures. Loved all of the water birds—Canadian Geese and their babies, Sea Gulls, Blue Herons, Pelicans, and even a Bald Eagle! So peaceful and relaxing.
My sister already mentioned it to a friend whose family is planning a future trip to the area. We would definitely seek to stay there again, if we return to the area.

Stayed with kids","This is a well appointed, comfortable home.
There are major downsides if you are looking for a quiet place. The trains are out of this world; literally the main line from Chicago to the west....dozens of trains per day..... DOZENS. The tracks are adjacent to the back yard and there are multiple crossing points in town that the horn happy conductors take great pride in laying on the horn all night and day. When there's no train...which is literally every few minutes, the rooster next door crows non stop.
if these things don't matter, it's a nice view overlooking the Mississippi River and the sunsets are beautiful.
WiFi and internet worked perfectly, Netflix was no issue.
The BBQ out back worked well and the garage has been converted to a games room which is nice.
Overall it's a nice spot if you are a train lover."

Stayed a few nights","Great location if you are staying in a hotel in Ft Madison. Bridge toll is currently free.
River views and sunsets are amazing from this property.
Single beds were very comfortable the Queen was a bit more firm than we like.
So many extras like soap, shampoo, spices, pan spray, paper towels, and tp was provided. It made trips into FM less necessary. There is also a Dollar General in town for the basics. Loved the cupboard with extra unopened food to share. Was a lifesaver to have some Raman noodles for my hungry son. We left some noodles to go with the spaghetti sauce that was already there for the next guest.
This was the most well equipped Airbnb I have stayed in (other than the one in Kenya that came with a chef, lol). Very nice home will rent again."

The neighborhood felt safe and walkable. The house is very well restored and maintained and has a lot of charm, with vintage and antique period-type decor throughout, while also offering modern conveniences and comforts. The rooms are spacious with high ceilings. The architecture of the home is beautiful, like stepping back in time. The home can be a destination in itself!

Very comfortable beds with excellent linens and pillows. Nice TV's with easy access to major streaming services. Good wifi and private spaces for occasional work calls if needed. Jeri was very responsive to some minor maintenance issues during our stay.
Excellent appliances, large fridge freezer, large freezer and nice washer/dryer. Kitchen had almost everything we needed. Many small appliances and gadgets, spices, etc, but we could not find a blender.
Property is in a nice quiet part of Fort Madison. Train noise was noticeable in the King bedroom in front of the house, but not enough to keep me awake. Ear plugs and white noise generator were available, but neither my wife or I used them and no one at the back of the house was bothered.

The beds and linens were incredibly comfortable. The kitchen was well-stocked with gadgets, pans, etc. so everything we needed was there.
The house itself was perfect for multiple families to stay. The photos were helpful in determining sleeping arrangements ahead of time. There was an incredible amount of space to spread out, relax, and not get in each others’ way. It is a very elaborate house, with multiple stairwells and living spaces, so the kids dubbed it “the maze house.” It was big enough for the kids to have plenty of space to play hide and seek."

House needs work. Main electrical breaker tripped four times in a week
Dishwasher overflowed onto kitchen floor twice. One real garbage can for a group of 10 for a week is inadequate. The pantry picture led us to believe there were two refrigerators but discovered one to be a full size freezer which was too much freezer space and insufficient refrigerator space.
Overall, loads of potential but not quite great yet."

Stayed with kids","GREaT historic home! We all had a blast living in the past for a few nights. Yes, it’s an old home and with that comes some creaks and groans. Currently, only one half bath and one bedroom lock. My kids and parents found it very uncomfortable that none of the other rooms came with locks. The master bedroom door doesn’t latch, not a big deal for us. Bring shampoo and conditioner and body wash as there’s only one small set in the house. And be aware that the train is extremely loud and will wake you up multiple times at night (only those in the master luckily). Just bring some earplugs. Otherwise, the house was extremely comfortable and we really enjoyed the historic aspect, with the large rooms, and maze-like configuration. Super easy to get to historic Nauvoo across the river and there’s an Aldi’s grocery store across from the park in the front of the house. It was super easy to cook here as the kitchen is fully stocked. We would definitely stay here again! Just beautiful!"

Stayed with kids","While there are some renovations still being completed on this house, they shouldn't have any noticable impact on your stay as long as you do not mind space heaters in the bedrooms.
I was excited about having the opportunity to stay in a Victorian home during my visit with family during Thanksgiving, and the photos were quite appealing. I can safely say the interior of the house is even more impressive than in the photos. I was hoping to give my brother's family a special treat by choosing this location, and was quite successful. It was very satisfying seeing how much they enjoyed the house. Their kiddos especially. This location has a perfect atmosphere for Thanksgiving and Christmas get togethers.
We had a group of 7, and never felt crowded. The check-in process went smoothly, and there was nothing unreasonable with the check out. The host is very responsive to messages. The kitchen is well stocked with appliances, and cooking implements. I truly felt like we could have made anything we could have wanted.
The surrounding community where the house is located is an older area. There are sections of well maintained homes, and others that are not. Once the exterior renovations to this house are complete it will be one of the best ones in it's immediate vicinity. We never felt unsafe. Just an old mid-west town."

Many light bulbs were burnt out and the front door wouldn't lock. Overall, it met our needs for the weekend."

Stayed a few nights","Our family had the privilege of spending our Thanksgiving at Miss Victoria's - T.L. Porter House in Burlington, Iowa, and it was an experience we will cherish forever.
From the moment we arrived, we were captivated by the charm and elegance of the house. The space is not only stunningly beautiful but also incredibly welcoming and comfortable, making it the perfect setting for our family gathering of 25 members. Each room is thoughtfully decorated, blending historic charm with modern comforts, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere.
The house was impeccably clean, and every amenity we could have wished for was provided. The kitchen was a dream to cook in, spacious and well-equipped, which made preparing our Thanksgiving feast not just easy but enjoyable.
The bedrooms were cozy and comfortable, ensuring a good night's sleep for all our family members. The communal areas, including the living and dining rooms, were perfect for our large group.
We will be back for sure! Thank you!!"

The views of the Mississippi River were fantastic! The town of Burlington is very historic and we loved walking around looking at all the old buildings. We also loved driving around and looking at the Victorian homes.
Fort Madison was also great!

The house itself was charming and tastefully decorated. Every corner was thoughtfully designed, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere. The attention to detail was evident, and we truly felt at home during our stay.
One of the highlights of our trip was undoubtedly the stunning view of the Mississippi River from the property. It was breathtaking to wake up to such a picturesque sight each morning. We spent hours enjoying the view from the comfortable seating areas both indoors and outdoors."

Stayed with kids","This property was exactly what was described. The building is older and there’s a definite stale cigarette smell in the hall, but the actual apartment is clean and doesn’t have the same smell.
The laundry is located just outside the room in the hall. We were there for two weeks, and I only saw one other tenant use it. It was a shared, token operated machine, but the host helped provide tokens, which we greatly appreciated.
It was a tight fit for 6 people, but we knew it would be when we booked it. The hardest part was sharing a bathroom.
The beds were very comfortable, which was a huge benefit.
The host was very communicative and helpful. He bent over backward to help us when we accidentally locked our key inside. Overall, it was a good value, just as described. If you want a perfect new place with no issues, you’ll have to pay more. But this property was clean and comfortable."

Stayed with kids","Our family reserved Sam's place for a family trip to Nauvoo. We were very comfortable. the kitchen/dining area was a little tight for the 6 of us, but the pictures portray that, so it wasn't a surprise. Sam left plenty of laundry tokens for us to use the washer/dryer, which was very helpful. We were staying here when the damaging durecho blew through, which impacted the Wi-Fi. That was a bummer, but out of anyone's control to get fixed right away. when it was time for us to check out, another bad-looking storm was heading our way. Sam was flexible enough to let us stay a little past checkout time so that we didn't have to be driving in the worst of the storm. we really appreciated that after our storm trauma the day before!"

It is a share common space with the rest of the building. And the bed room with the bunk beds doesn’t have a door on it. I’m assuming to keep the cold air flowing through the whole apartment. And you have to keep the other bedroom door open to cool down the bedroom since there is not vents in there . great town and nice security for the apartment. I would definitely stay again

The kitchen was great for all of our meal needs and Sam provided everything we needed to make our stay as pleasant as possible. He responded quickly to questions I had and had clear concise instructions to follow for our stay. I would recommend you stay here in a heartbeat.

The space worked well for our family to visit Nauvoo for way less money than if we stayed across the river. It is not a luxury apartment by any means, but was clean and functional and a great value. Just ignore the common entryway to the building (it smelled kind of musty and seemed to be under renovation when we were there) and the actual apartment is much better. Kitchen and kitchen table are tight for more than four people, but we fit seven comfortably in beds. Trains do go by at night a few blocks away if that bothers you, it didn’t bother us. You also may have to wait at the drawbridge to cross the river occasionally, but we thought that was cool to watch."

He bent over backwards to make sure we were as comfortable as possible, even with our crazy schedule. The location was much closer than places like Keokuk, which made it SO convenient. Only bit of advice we'd offer - make sure you know when the barge is coming through the bridge so you can prepare in advance for the delay. Without the delay it's 15-20 minutes to old town Nauvoo. With the delay, it's about 30. So, even with the delay, it's quicker than driving in from Keokuk or Burlington."

Stayed a few nights","This is a wonderfully cozy house and not in terms that realtors normally use to just describe a small space, because along with having plenty of space, this house does have a very cozy atmosphere with plenty of places to relax or interact with family and friends. Very clean, easy checking! We will definitely be staying here again. Best value for the money of any Airbnb in Ft. Madison hands down!"

The only things I didn't like were that I had to walk down the stairs sideways so I didn't fall. I almost did, the first time coming down them. And the ice maker and water dispenser on the fridge didn't work. Otherwise a good place."

Stayed with a pet","Jessica's place was a quiet space in a lovely town. We stayed there on the way to visit family up north and so we just needed a quiet, peaceful space to lay our heads although Jessica's place certainly is stocked for if you need more - especially well prepared if you are traveling with children! The arrangement of both bedrooms wasn't a problem for us but was a little tricky with our disabled dog. (Thankfully Jessica was quick to answer our questions and a baby gate was built in so safety was never an issue.)"

I really enjoyed my stay it was exactly what was posted. I would stay again.

House was very clean and well maintained, except the ceiling fan in the main bedroom. I wish i had paid better attention to the reviews before i booked, it was right next to a trainyard with trains blowing through regularly. Not a huge deal for me but could bother a lot of people. The neighbors are odd, one was up running power tools for about an hour and a half at 1-2 AM one night. Like chop saws and power sanders. I was glad to see the host had security cameras and was very particular about door locks."

Group trip","It is difficult to find good, inexpensive accommodations in Nauvoo during the summer tourist season unless you have booked early. Ft. Maddison is 20 min from Nauvoo with inexpensive but generally poor accommodations. This home is nicely renovated but in a run-down neighborhood close to the very busy rail line mentioned by others. However, all 7 adults in our party were very comfortable. Access with a unique code was simple and quick. The kitchen sink faucet was causing a significant leak under the sink. The friendly neighbor, who Jessica uses for support, tried to help. We thought it was loose connections but soon realized the mixing valve in the faucet had failed. We improvised a solution to catch the leak and the next day Jessica and her husband drove one hour from their location and replaced the faucet. Our four nights at Jessica's was enjoyable with our ladies cooking up a storm in the well-equipped kitchen. Thank you Jessica - all of us would stay again."

Stayed a few nights","Too expensive for an old house with super hard mattresses, constant loud trains and very steep stairs. No way to completely close the master bedroom curtains- letting in lots of morning light. Temp gage locked at 70 degrees and won’t go lower. Terrible for a hot July. There was a 2nd AC in the window upstairs but it was warmer than we wanted even at night.
Overpriced! I felt like I overpaid by a lot. Owner was responsive to get new sheets for the bed at 10pm from the attic but it was obvious they were not changed recently - hair and nail clippings in the bed. Kitchen floors need cleaned better- turned my feet dark grey. Location is central to town but neighbors are very close and noisy. No problems with communication but almost $500 is too much for 3 nights."

Stayed a few nights","Jessica was easy to communicate with and we had no issues finding the place. It was very clean and had the basics supplied. I wish we had read the reviews before booking. The houses on the block are rundown with junk in the yards. Trains do sound their horns and could be heard while awake but none woke us up. There are no end tables or table lamps. This made watching TV or reading a bit challenging. There aren't any knives other than butter knives so if you planned to do any serious cooking, you can't. There was cereal as others mentioned but it was stale because it was not in an air tight container and there wasn't any milk. However, there were English muffins for breakfast. We weren't aware that both bedrooms were on the 2nd level and the stairs were shallow and steep and the baby gait at the top is a trip hazard. The king bed is for people who like a very firm mattress. We slept on the full sized bed the second night which was more comfortable. Overall, it was a decent place."

Stayed with a pet","Jessica was a fine communicator and ultimately because we did NOT stay, she agreed to refund all except airbnb fees. We were greeted in front by an overly friendly and curious neighbor's bulldog (who jumped on me repeatedly) and a small grandchild who explained, ""she'd been in the house because her gran was the cleaner and there were toys; did we have kids? ""
We did not expect a listing in such a run-down location, homes with patched walls and boarded windows on either side. One neighbor was busy using a power tool on a fence project (we could hear that inside the house.) The train went by while we were there and it was quite loud inside. The home is older. Interior stairs didn't feel secure and near top of stairs there's a gap that would allow a small pet to fall through to the lower level. The pet/child gate at the top of the stairs was concerning as a tripping hazard. While there were interior pictures, they didn't give a full picture of the home or neighborhood safety/reality."

Stayed with a pet","The neighborhood was quiet. We were in town for a wedding and spending time with out of town family. Jessica provided clear instructions for the home, it was clean, and what I loved most was the extra things that I may have needed during our stay. Being a Mama, sometimes a child needs more to do than their own toys. There was toys for my littles to play with up and downstairs. There were extra covers, pillows, blow up mattress, dog crate if needed (we had our own), and towels for us. (First time I have experienced having more towels) My family had enough space and thankful that it felt like home for a week. Not only did she provide extra food, seasonings in the kitchen, she also provided soap, toilet paper, pads if needed, a kiddy potty, just above and beyond. We felt truly like guests in her home. We felt very taken care of. Her communication was on point, and easy directions in caring for the home. When we visit Iowa again, we will book with her again! Thank you!"

It was nice to have children's toys and items especially the baby gate for the stairs. However, a couple child locks were broken to cabinets that contained cleaners or glass. The king bed was comfortable. During our stay the trains ran at all hours of the night and day. The house is 1 block away from the closest train. If you aren't used to train horns, bring earplugs!"

The $75 in various fees was kinda high, because the place was not very clean. My kid got really dirty crawling all around. Also the breakfast included was like, 2 boxes of half empty cereal. I strongly recommend bringing your own. Also heads up – beware the toll bridge, if you get stuck on one side while the bridge is disconnected for a ship, you'll be there a while."

Stayed over a week","I enjoyed staying at Jessica's place for 2 months with my dog. It's dog friendly and has a nice backyard. I don't have kids but if I did there were lots of nice things for kids to use like a toddler play set and a trampoline for the older kids. The bed was comfy, the kitchen was nice, and there was consistent and fast internet for people who might do a little working from home. The in-house laundry was really nice too.
You can hear the train from everywhere in Fort Madison, this stay included. I slept with earplugs and it was just fine. I would recommend this for a long term rental for a single individual or a family."

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed our stay in Jessica's home. The neighborhood isn't the best in town but we felt safe, especially with the nice next door neighbor sitting on her porch. The trains didn't bother us all that much and the house contains lots of nice touches. It's an older house but clean and well cared for. The steps are indeed steep so a bit challenging for anyone not steady on their feet. There's not much privacy in the loft bedroom either so probably a better choice for some than others. Jessica provided lots of food, paper products and coffee so we felt well cared for. A good choice for our needs."

You should be aware that the trains do run at all hours, however we didn't have a problem sleeping through that noise. Also be aware that the stairs are very steep. And the washer and dryer are nice but be sure to bring your own laundry detergent. Overall, a nice affordable place."

Grocery stores nearby as well as Hall’s ice cream/Dairy Queen. As for the trains, Jessica was transparent and let everyone know about the noise. It wasn’t a surprise.

No cable that we could find; only Netflix and amazon on our personal accounts. We stayed only one night so the overall cost was too much given the industrial neighborhood and trains. There were several areas in the house that were not clean. Had we had access to pictures of the neighboring homes and surroundings we would not have stayed there.

The two bathrooms met our needs. The bedrooms had plenty of room both upstairs, though the stairs are a little narrow front to back when going down (take your time and you're fine). The two beds are opposite ends of comfortable one on the more stiff side and the other softer (depends on what you like).
