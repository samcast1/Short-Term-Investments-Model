Stayed with kids","The family and I had a great weekend get-away staying at the cabin. The cabin was very clean and cozy, and had all the amenities one could ask for, with the exception of Wi-Fi, but we knew that going in. Got good cell reception, so was still able to stream some football on the iPad. We enjoyed walking the trails and taking in the sheer beauty of the property. The kids enjoyed volleyball, badminton, bags, card games out on the screened-in porch, s’mores and hotdogs over the fire pit, and curling up and watching DVDs next to the wood-burning stove. Overall a wonderful and relaxing time. Highly recommend."

Stayed with kids","“Welcome home” is a phrase that best describes our visit to Ernie & Mindy’s Timberhaven Getaways.
This review will also serve as a review for our cabin experience during the same time period last year.
Our experience begins with waking up to a peaceful nature-scape, walking the dew-kissed woods (early bird gets the worm), and watching a variety of birds chirping, knocking, humming. The occasional friendly cat and frog can also be found enjoying the company of guests. Be sure to setup the hammock and take time to swing as part of your morning relaxation routine.
For those guests who want to meet the hosts, you will find the Adkins family to be caring, generous, and godly. Do not hesitate to reach out to them for anything you may need, or cannot seem to find, and they will provide an accommodation. We endeared our cabin hosts during our first visit and cannot imagine the Log Cabin In The Woods without them."

Group trip",My five sisters and I had a great vacay at this cabin in the woods. This place is such a gem! The screened in porch was amazing for some early morning bird watching. The red headed woodpeckers were everywhere and we really enjoyed watching and hearing them! We loved the coffee options and the hosts were so great and responsive when I was in need of a birthday candle and playing cards (both were delivered to the cabin). The whole property is so beautiful and the hike to the lake was fun! I couldn’t say enough great things about this place.

Stayed with kids","The Cabin and surrounding area are beautiful and provided everything needed for our time away from home. The quiet setting was what we were looking for and the Cabin in the Woods did not disappoint. While sitting on the front porch swing and rocking chairs, we were able to enjoy the mornings drinking tea while listening to the birds and the faint sound of the train in the distance. The Cabin is far enough away from the crowds, yet close enough to town to find nearly anything you need. The beds were very comfortable and the bathroom well stocked with nice towels and wash cloths. The kitchen has everything you need to cook and the table was large enough to fit 4 adults and a child without any problems. Although we did not have the time to enjoy a fire in the evenings, the Cabin does have a nice area with comfortable benches to provide the perfect ending to the day. Overall, we found this Cabin to be everything we were looking for during our stay and highly recommend it for anyone looking for some quiet time away from home."

Ernie and Mindy were very friendly and when we needed something they were there immediately. The bathroom and kitchen functioned well and are stylish too. Beds were quite comfortable. AC is strong! Our stay was too short to enjoy everything about this place. If we need to stay in Newton again we won't hesitate to book this place. We wish it was closer to our home!"

Ernie and Mindy were incredibly kind - they answered all of our questions within an hour or two, they left us a nice gift basket of treats when we arrived, and they even went above and beyond to mail us some belongings we had accidentally left behind. The cabin itself was in great shape with plenty of the necessities to make it an excellent getaway. This cabin will absolutely be at the top of our list for places to stay when we start looking for where we're going next year."

Many acres of mature woods surround the cabin to make you feel like you are a world away. Nice updates throughout including a beautiful tile shower, AC, sound system, & Comfortable beds. Be prepared for about 2 miles of gravel road and no tv and no internet. Close to town if you want to venture out for some activities. We loved the fire pit with comfortable benches even though it was too rainy to make a fire. Lovely setting and a lovely place for rest and relaxation. We would definitely go back !!"

Stayed with kids","If you’re seeking a beautiful, quiet, relaxing setting and cabin, plus exceptional hospitality, this is just the place. Even during a chilly week in early October, we made good use of the outdoor amenities - fire pit, grill, covered porch and a second screened-in porch, plus miles of trails through fields and woods. The walk to the pond was especially nice, with a sweet bench for sitting to gaze at the water.
Ernie and Mindy were delightful hosts - generous and attentive without being intrusive.
We were reuniting with our son and his family for the first time in almost a year due to COVID-19. We drove a camper from Washington, and they drove from Chicago. We slept in the camper but shared lots of outdoor time together. Everybody loved it, including the toddler, and the many outdoor amenities helped us follow safe practices.
So glad we found this place."

The beds were very comfortable, the kitchen had even more supplies than we expected, the bathroom was gorgeous, and they even had a welcome basket with snacks and beverages when we arrived. We played badminton, volleyball, and cornhole with our kids, which we all loved. The fire pit was perfect for making smores and sitting around while enjoying some drinks.
A huge storm rolled through during the second day of our stay, knocking out electricity and causing quite a bit of damage to the property. They checked in on us often, making sure we were safe and ensuring we had everything we needed in the unexpected turn of events. They're just super friendly, awesome people!
We hope to come again soon to enjoy the trails and serene setting. It's a great place to relax and reconnect!"

Stayed with kids","My family had a delightful time at Mindy and Ernie’s cabin. The cabin is completely charming and very clean, and the surrounding property is so beautiful. We enjoyed hiking the trails every day. The screened in porch was perfect for eating dinner and having morning coffee. We could listen to the sounds of nature without having to endure insects at the same time. We had a great time playing cornhole, volleyball, and badminton with each other. The fire pit was fantastic in the evenings. We had everything we needed while we were there, plus we were happy to have the amenities of a beautiful bathroom and air conditioning!
Shortly after we arrived, Mindy drove up as we were outside playing cornhole. She wanted to make sure we had everything we needed and to let us know that we could text if there was anything at all that we needed. On the final morning we were there, my husband took a couple of our kids to the pond to fish. They asked Ernie if they were on the right track as they passed by, and he explained how to get there. A little while later, he rode down on a four wheeler to make sure they were heading in the right direction. It’s that kind of thing that helps add to the experience. We felt that Mindy and Ernie genuinely wanted us to feel at home and enjoy our time there. We are so grateful that they are willing to share their property and would highly recommend their cabin to anyone who wants to unplug and be close to nature, while still enjoying modern amenities! Our kids (12, 9, and 7) did not miss tv or wifi at all, and they have made us promise that we will go back again some day and stay longer next time. None of us were ready to leave! Thank you, Mindy and Ernie, for a wonderful getaway!"

We enjoyed our campfire, playing games on the screened-in porch, and sitting on the swing together for quiet moments. We are already hoping for a return visit in the fall and/or winter, because our kids were disappointed we didn't use the wood burning stove -- in the heat of July. :) I highly recommend Mindy & Ernie's cabin!"

We stayed at the larger of the two cabins this time and it was just as relaxing as the first stay (at the smaller cabin). We spent quality family time together playing games - roasting marshmallows. We were also able to see wildlife - birds at the feeders, squirrels chasing each other, deer out in the field and in the timber - we even walked the trails out to the pond to sit and relax (caught a couple bullheads and a snapping turtle the first stay :)). We highly recommend this place!"

The only warning I have is that the gravel road in has LOTS of potholes so be sure to watch the road. However, if you there at the right time, you will be serenaded by frogs along the road to keep you entertained as you take your time. :D"

Stayed with a pet","Collins-“A short country drive to Anywhere”
We were traveling with a 3 month old and a dog, which is already stressful enough so we needed the PERFECT spot to relax for 7 days. Our main destination was for Ames but Brett’s place had everything we needed.
Before we arrived Brett made sure to contact us via air bnb. He greeted us and gave us local recommendations.
The beds were comfortable, the water was nice and hot, and the people were friendly.
Ames was 30 minutes away but it was a straight shot on the hwy so it felt much closer than it sounds. It was also a beautiful drive.
This spot is only a few houses down from the Sweet Oaks Cafe. I highly recommend going there for a coffee with biscuits and gravy before you start your day. TRY THE CHEESECAKE.
I’ve never been to Iowa but this was a delightful surprise. You can watch a beautiful Iowan sunrise/sunset through the glass back door from the comfort of the couch.
This stay was better than any hotel. Just go ahead and BOOK IT!!"

This gave me and my adult children a much better place to stay together and they loved it as well! The host Brett is super communicative and I felt comfortable calling and asking him questions as needed. This was already a tough trip to place my mom’s ashes with her late husband to rest in peace and the stay here was exactly what I needed. I will stay here again if I come back to see family!"

Upon arrival, the owner greeted us and gave us a detailed run down of the property and nearby surroundings. He even supplied us with ice cream and water bottles to enjoy during our stay. My daughter of course was excited about the ice cream. The area is very quiet/ peaceful. It’s true country living. The sunsets are breathtaking and can be viewed from the back of the house. This place was clean and felt comfortable. The owner is right next door, so if you have any issues he is there to assist. If you were to ask would I stay again, the answer would be, for sure."

Stayed with a pet","Nice small town! Brett is a very friendly guy when he came over to introduce himself (lives next door) there are some things lacking on this property to make it a 5 Star rating. Here are the positive things.
Comfortable beds, snacks & water provided. Here are the negative things, upon arriving it had dirty floors ( crumbs), also counters & one of the comforters even had crumbs. I think that is what ultimately led to the severe ant infestation. Dirty refrigerator & freezer. The bathroom seemed clean but I had to tighten up the toliet seat as it was swaying back & fourth. The air condition in the living room doesn’t work. He said to leave both bedroom doors open so that the unit would stay cold. We wanted to hang outside but we’re uncomfortable to do so since the son lives literally in the backyard of the house. Had that been mentioned in the listing we would not have booked. The Wi-Fi code had been recently updated but not noted, had to call to get the code. Beds are small."

He welcomed us when we arrived and answered all our questions and as well he was not intrusive and stopped by once more a few days later. The airbnb is just the right size with all amenities needed for a airbnb away from home.
Only negative is if your coming for work or a event this is a great airbnb ,but I would not recommend this for a vacation since the town is only 500 people with not more attractions nearby."

He knew we were coming in late and he went as far as putting food in the house so we could eat if we were not able to get any. What an amazing person. Thanks m"

Stayed about a week",This house was just what my dog and I needed for accommodations while visiting family in the Ankeny area. Super comfortable with everything needed. After a few days on the road I was in need of a couple nights of good sleep. Very comfortable beds. a great shower and everything needed to put together a meal helped me to recharge my batteries. Located within easy access to highways and interstates in central Iowa area. I would highly recommend staying at Brett’s house.

Stayed a few nights","Without a doubt; guests will be AWAY from BIG CITY life but within reasonable access to ""IT"" with Des Moines being (at least) half hour away
i didn't personally meet the host (road tired and crabby i was) but the host called me to give me the low down of WHERE TO FIND WHAT and unlock the front door
the house is simple and provides all the basics (bathroom is a bit cramped)
the fridge was somewhat stocked with food and water so i could go into limbo for a few days.
beds are comfy; there are two HUGE garbage and recycle bind just outside the door
if you seek being able to access BIG CITY but calm down to farming community (the road where the house is PRETTY BUSY)
I went out on a limb renting this house but at the risk of dealing with a scuzzy hotel of unknown variables...ID rather be ALONE than in a questionable hotel that'll leave me questioning WHETHER OR NOT I'LL SEE ""TOMORROW""
Being this far AWAY also makes me appreciate ""the busy"" of civilization"

He went above and beyond to ensure we had an exceptional stay. If you're not familiar with Midwest hospitality, you will experience it here. If you're looking for the hustle and bustle of the city, you won't find it here. However, if you're looking for a peaceful experience that still gives you easy access to Des Moines, Ames, etc., this is the place you need to be. You won't be disappointed with your stay here."

Stayed with kids","This place is so perfect! Brett is very friendly and responsive! He’s always messaged me back promptly. Being my first Airbnb, I didn’t know what to expect, Brett definitely goes above and beyond. There were adequate linens, fully stocked kitchen appliances, and to my surprise, there was some food stocked and even the medicine cabinet was stocked with toiletries you may have forgotten! I thought that was awesome and thoughtful! We didn’t use it but there is a washer and dryer perfect for a longer stay. The two bedrooms were perfect, giving us privacy that a hotel can’t provide for the price! I enjoyed the fire place, it really put the heat out! The really cool thing, is that the furniture moves easily, so if you had an air mattress, it would be an easy set up for extra sleepers. There were ample outlets in every room. Cleaning supplies under the sink. A folding table, chairs, games and an ironing board in the closet. There is a smart tv which was awesome, we just logged in with our accounts and was able to stream movies! Oh and the cutest of all, we’re the candy dishes that were set out! I certainly recommend this to everyone and will definitely stay here again!!"

Down to the immediate response times to having the house stocked with goodies to snack on! The place is brand spanking new so the fresh smell of ""just built house"" puts your mind at ease for wondering about the cleanliness. The host lives close by so if anything is needed hes just a second away! The host wore a mask at all times when we were greeted and also had plenty of masks fully stocked for their guests! Safety was a definite priority! The kitchen was stocked with every cooking item needed for an evening in or if you feel like going out Brett has plenty of great recommendations! Dont forget not to make plans on Mondays though, Brett brings by dishes from the local restaurants so dinner is on him that night! Brett set the bar so high for us and now we dont know how we will stay anywhere else! Lol. Thanks guys!!"

Lara’s daughter let our little 2 year old great-granddaughter ‘help’ her do the chores! It is a rather unique place with ducks, rabbits, and chickens. Our little one can now crow like a real rooster!
The beds are comfortable, the refrigerator is spotless, the washer and dryer are huge, the views are lovely, the walking paths are well kept, no traffic, very peaceful setting!
Since we had 2 littles with us, it was nice to have the play area complete with new swings! We spent some time, everyday, playing outside.
There are lots of various birds that congregate in the beautiful trees that grace the big yard of this unique farmhouse.
It really is a Happy Valley!!"

Plenty of bedroom options to choose from for our group. The house is within easy driving distance to Ames which was our main reason for staying in the area. I just wish we had more time to explore the trails or try some local places in State Center. Lara was a delight! Very responsive to any questions ahead of our stay and we enjoyed getting to chat with her for a bit while we were there. I think we will definitely try to come back again on a weekend that isn't already so busy with college graduation activities!

The host was lovely, responsive and kind. The farmhouse was rustic, but had modern upgrades and there was ample space. The land had gorgeous views of the valley (there aren’t many valleys in Iowa, so this was quite a treat). I would recommend bringing hiking shoes so you can enjoy the trails. We will be back!"

Sad we didn't have a chance to deop into Clark's Bar. Next time!"

When I arrived, I found a plain and simple entrance, and when I opened the door (with an outstanding touchscreen lock), I found the interior as clean, spacious, shiny new, comfortable and welcoming as I could ever want. And at such a reasonable price. Highly recommend!!!"

No complaints - we are already talking about when we can visit again! Pete was a great communicator and graciously allowed us to check out a little late so we could squeeze in one more round of golf.

We all had enough space to ourselves, had plenty of entertaining areas to be in.
The pool was awesome, daughter almost was hit in the head with a ball in pool, luckily she was not :) The pool house worked great so we could stay outside without being wet and having to go inside at all :)
Kitchen was fully stocked and we were able to make lots of our meals there just fine.
I can't thank Pete enough for being so quick with his responses.
I would suggest better toilet paper or for anyone traveling to maybe bring their own ;)
Thanks so much, would love to go back with my grandkids and husband someday!"

Stayed with kids","This home has it all! We had 11 people (5 kids ranging in age from 8-14) stay. Half the group loves to golf and half loves to swim. This house was perfect. Many, many hours were spent in the heated pool (including swims after dinner). The pool was HUGE. There was a pool house with a bathroom for easy (wet) potty breaks. The pool house had a screened in porch that we were able to feed hungry/wet kids in (without bringing them into the main house). When the kids needed a swim break they played badminton and volleyball with the net that's next to the pool. The golfers were able to golf anytime day or evening by taking the cart (that comes with the house rental) and starting wherever there was room on the course (there was always plenty of room). It was delightful to be able to play a few holes and then go back to the house as needed. We cooked meals and there was plenty of cooking pots/pans/knives and serving ware for all. This property was great."

Berny’s place was a huge hit, especially with our dog, Winston. Berny was out of town at the beginning of our stay, so her husband Mac filled in a little bit. He brought us firewood when we were low, and was a hoot and a half. Other than that, they left us alone for the weekend to connect and hang out. The trail around the lake is beautiful! Would 100% recommend and hope to return again :-)"

Berny has decorated the cottage in a very cute attractive decor. We loved the fact we could sit out on the deck anytime of day and just relax. You have neighbors next door but still feel like your own private spot. It was great to have laundry facilities right in the house.
You can walk along the lake on a rustic trail which was great! I can imagine in summer it is a bit busier. Would be great to do a little fishing or canoeing.
The kitchen is well stocked as far as utensils and cookware. Really nice to have a keurig coffee maker and k-cups supplied.
The beds are comfortable and the bathrooms were spotless.
All in all we fully enjoyed our weekend respite in the cottage in the pines. I can see us coming back again to stay."

Even down to little coffee creamers! So thoughtful! The outdoor patio is a perfect place to read or relax as you face the trees and hear birds sing. This is sure to be your next favorite place!

There were plenty of shampoos, conditioners, and lotions; the kitchen was well stocked with water (regular and sparkling) and light snacks. The cottage was also decorated so nicely for Christmas - I'm an antique junkie (and Mona owns an antique store), so all of the decorations really warmed my soul. I never expected to have a desire to come back to Iowa (I'm a city girl), but The Cottage On The Edge has definitely made me want to return!"

I really appreciated all the switches being marked to easily turn on/off lights. There were snacks on the counter, wine to enjoy, cold water in the fridge. She had the bathroom stocked with amenities so one didn’t need to bring items. She has a guide to local things. The cottage is spotless. I enjoyed the patio and proximity to paved paths to explore. I look forward to returning again. I may even bring my husband! Thank you for a pleasant stay!!"

They have kitchen supplies if you want to bring food to cook. The pictures are exactly what you get. They even lay out areas you can visit in Iowa. We are pretty picky people, and we do not have any complaints. The host's truly have a gift for this, because they've thoroughly thought of everything. Will definitely book again."

Stayed a few nights","It was EXACTLY what we needed, and we didn't know it! We wanted a last-minute weekend getaway that was relatively close to Boone, IA because we wanted to go on the Boone Scenic Valley Railroad Train Ride and go through Ledges State Park. We were also planning on going on the High Trestle Bike Trail, but we never ended up going because just down the hill from the bnb was the Chichaqua Bottoms Bike Trail! We could have stayed at the place longer, to ride the trail to Bondurant. Though we didn't go there, we went to Baxter where they had a coffee shop and so many parks for a small town, one of which was very nice. As track and field fans we appreciated their new track as well! The barn was SO comfy especially with the beds! As a person with special dietary needs, the kitchen was well equipped to cook the meals I needed, i especially loved the electric hot water kettle. Joyce was also so nice to show us the rest of the barn and tell us a little bit about the land that we love!"

I would love to return next spring/summer to continue to enjoy the prairie restoration and see the progress. I had my coffee and breakfast outside every morning with my binoculars in hand and did some fantastic bird watching. I am a Minnesota Naturalist certified in the Prairies and Potholes region, I really commend Joyce & Family on their commitment to return the land back to prairie and create a wonderful home for the diverse creatures and animals who live outside on their land. Overall, this place really is a treasure and you won’t regret staying here."

Each of the bedrooms were large enough to accommodate our luggage without feeling cramped and offers beds that are very comfortable. The linens and blankets provided were just like being at home. There are several spaces to relax both inside and outside of the house. Each offers its own comfort depending on what you are desiring. The lake is an added bonus.

Stayed with kids","After having a horrific experience at a different rental (not AirBnB), we needed last-minute accommodations for 6 people which was a long shot- I was devastated because I planned to cook and have access to a house.
Despite this bad luck, I was able to quickly book this amazing lake house in a pinch, and we were so lucky. This is likely the cleanest Air BnB that I have ever stayed. It's stocked with all the essentials like pots, pans, oil, seasonings, condiments, dish soap, detergent pods, trash bags, paper towels, makeup remover, board games, etc. The view is absolutely beautiful. The walk the lake is short. There is a dining table outdoors and a bonfire in the front yard. The owners even stopped by to water the plants and saw my husband and son struggling to get the fire started and helped them get it started! Even the firewood is provided. There is a picnic basket. The lakr is a hidden treasure. I kayaked the entire lake and saw incredible wildlife
Great Air BnB- would stay again."

Group trip",A very comfortable home filled with fun and beautiful decor... a great space for our 6 adults. Loved the large dining room table--perfect for meals and card games! A special touch to look out the large picture windows and see the flower beds and bird feeders--with lots of birds visiting! Private and quiet setting with the lake close by for a leisurely boat ride. Thoroughly enjoyed our time there! Would suggest a 2nd bathroom in possible future plans but it really wasn't a problem with the one--large and well stocked. Thank you for your hospitality!

Group trip","Five of my high school girlfriends and I rented this property for a summer reunion. The house looked exactly like the pictures but you have to be there to experience the ambience! Julie was so easy to communicate with and responded quickly to every inquiry. The beds were so comfortable that everyone got a good nights sleep after long days of talking, playing cards and eating. The kitchen was perfect for cooking as it had all the cookware and utensils we needed...although admittedly the first night we had Pagliai's Pizza from Grinnell. The view of Rock Creek Lake from the outdoor patio and from the sun room was breathtaking, especially the sunset. I would highly recommend renting this property. Thanks Julie!"

Stayed with kids","One of the best AirBnBs we’ve stayed at! Julie was incredibly responsive, both in terms of reaching out ahead of time and answering questions while we were there. The kitchen had everything we needed and more- an assortment of nice pans, steamer, grater and more tools you don’t usually see at other AirBnBs, not to mention a grill. The home was beautifully and thoughtfully decorated, true to pictures, with lots of natural light. We loved sitting in the living room overlooking the lake enjoying our coffee in the morning and unwinding in the evening and enjoying dinners on the back patio. We had 3 generations together and Julie’s thoughtful additions made bringing our baby easy- a modern Fisher Price crib in the master with room darkening curtains, a monitor, an IKEA high chair with a wipeable floor mat, and blocks that our baby and toddler both enjoyed. Thanks Julie for the lovely lake stay!"

We came to attened the Tulip Festival in Pella and had the added bonus of a beautiful home and location away from the crowds; and with a short drive! We plan to come back to enjoy the lake and other quaint towns we did not have time to enjoy during our stay.
Julie was an amazing host! I honestly felt like we were friends or family after communicating with her. She was very pleasant and helpful!
The house was stunning with an open view in almost every room with all the windows!! We loved watching the lake, lightening at night, and all the wild life during the day. It was certainly an amazing trip and stay!"

Group trip","Julie has an amazing property! The view is fantastic, you can see it from the dining room table as well. There are trails around the lake, and they are just steps away from the backyard.
There is tons of seating for reading and hanging out.
She has all the necessities for the kitchen, including a lot of basic spices and oils. Very helpful for our group, which cooks a lot of meals. She has the home beautifully decorated, and a lot of it was season specific, so I assume she changes stuff out each season. We loved the curb appeal of pumpkins in the landscaping.
Julie is very prompt with communications and helped with anything extra we needed (firewood, etc)
I highly recommend this property, I think it would be beautiful to stay at in any season."

Stayed a few nights","We had a simply wonderful stay at what we may call our Iowa lake house, and we hope to stay again! The house feels so spacious and the picture windows make it a haven for enjoying nature from inside if the weather demands. We found the location to be a delightful surprise after finding it last minute. There were great options for how to enjoy the area, including pontoon boats, kayaking, hiking, and visiting the nearby towns of Grinnell and Newton. We had a wonderful, relaxing stay. The stars at night were stunning. For bird lovers, the picture windows allow for resting and watching the birds visit the trees and birdfeeder. Although the property isn't directly on the waterfront, the water is a short 1 minute walk down the road and is viewable from the house constantly. The trees and wildflowers provide a nice buffer from the public lakefront, which was quiet and not very busy at all. We would definitely recommend this home to others."

Stayed a few nights","This was an absolutely perfect spot for a romantic Christmas getaway. We had a wonderful time. Beautiful, cozy, well-appointed space.
We were there during the bomb cyclone blizzard of 2022. If we had arrived earlier and been able to stay later it would have been an idyllic snowed in vacation. As it was, Jillynn’s husband and son went to heroic measures to make sure we got there after we got stuck in a snowbank on our drive in, and went to even more heroic measures to dig my car out of drifting snow during our second evening. I’m very grateful for their trouble and regretful that I put them through that; I certainly had no right to expect that. I took a risk given the weather and I’m glad it turned out all right.
And it still was an idyllic vacation! Given the outcome — we got there safely and left when we needed to — I’m very happy with everything. I think I do have to sound the warning about the difficulty of getting there in snow, and the possibility of drifting once you’re there."

Although I don’t eat eggs it was the most adorable touch of having fresh farm eggs waiting in the fridge upon our arrival.

We maxed out the occupancy with 5 adults and 2 kiddos. Everyone had a nice place to sleep but it was a challenge finding somewhere for everyone to sit to watch a movie. Thats really my only complaint. This was a great place to stay."

A great fully equipped kitchen, beautiful bath, heated concrete floors, comfortable beds and furniture made our stay most pleasant. We also enjoyed the peaceful farmstead with kittens, ducks, and peacocks! A great firepit, though wind prevented us from using it. I would highly recommend the Henhouse to others!"

The friendly hosts have thought of everything you might need and more. The accommodations are a perfect blend of luxury and nature - all the comforts of home and soft and beautifully decorated furnishings.
A few features that we really enjoyed were the comfortable outdoor seating around a firepit (which we hope to use on a return visit!), acres of quiet farmland, entertaining farm animals, very hospitable hosts, and delicious local food options.
This is more than a place to stay. It is a place where you can find space to reimagine a different way of life that is more connected with the land."

Saw bald eagles and all kinds of other birds. Very private and secluded we did not see anyone else the entire weekend. Check in and communication was excellent and we were met at check by Mindy to go over the property. The House has large primary bedroom and 2 smaller bedrooms upstairs with a another semi private bedroom in basement. House is an older house but the surrounding 320 acres are stunning .

If you like tranquility and willing to drive on gravel roads to get there, this is the perfect home! The pond on the property is well stocked and we were able to catch and release multiple fish! We also got in a nice workout by taking a beautiful hike around the pond. Ample bedding and towels and multiple places to gather as a family in the home (e.g., basement family room, living room with wood burning stove, and an amazing master suite)."

Stayed a few nights","I stayed at Brett’s place with a group of 6 people and 5 dogs for my first trip to Iowa hunting pheasants. We wanted to hunt wild Iowa roosters, and we were not disappointed. Brett and his wife did a great job explaining the properties we were allowed to hunt and the pheasants were there. Our dogs got to learn about hunting wild birds and not just the planted chickens you get at some other outfitters.
The home itself was spacious and clean and had everything you could have needed. It was a great space to relax after a days hunt.
I was able to call Brett with any issues and he was quick address them.
My group has already planned a return trip!"

We enjoyed sitting out on the patio every evening and watching the deer down by the lake , the turkeys meandering around and the occasional hackle of pheasants. Plenty of room for a family get together, we teased Brett we only used 1/4 of the house with just the two of us, But we wanted a nice place to just relax and enjoy the country. This definitely provided that and we enjoyed the Amana Colonies less than a 1/2 hour away. Brett was great at meeting us and was easy to communicate with."

My only two pet peeves-
1. the mattresses are basically concrete. You may want to bring a bed-roll cushion if you require a bit of softness.
2. I wish the lightbulbs could be changed to warm/yellow light. Almost all bulbs in the house were fluorescent “daylight” bulbs. Very harsh, especially considering how cozy the overall space is.
Overall, 10/10, can’t wait to visit again."

We had fires 🔥 every night, and enjoyed pontoon rides on the lake. The house is on hills, so it’s a walk to get up and down. I didn’t have any problem myself, but handicap accessible people may. The best part about our vacation is that our dogs were able to run free !! No worry about any neighbors… just always FREEEEE!! Definitely a place to try out! Gorgeous house! Great host too!"

Stayed a few nights","The property was amazing. The house itself was a bit dated (kind of like going back in time to the late 80s/early 90s), but everything in the home were in perfect working order. The kitchen was fully equipped and had a large refrigerator, microwave and stove. It was an open concept and made the living space on the first floor very open. The living room has a log stove which came in very useful - it was a treat to have a nice fire going when it was rainy outside. The bedrooms and bathrooms were well appointed including a jacuzzi tub in the Master. The only thing to remember is bath soap is not provided, so be sure to bring your own. The basement was a dream come true for our youngest son as he could watch tv, play games and play ping-pong as well. Movie night was always a big hit!
We had complete privacy (unless you count the cows) which was fantastic. While some hosts may claim privacy, you can find neighbors much closer than you expected. Here - the only person we saw was the caretaker Roger (and he was an absolute gem!) The nearest town was about 20 minutes away, so if you forget anything you do have a chance to grab it - just be aware you will be driving at least 40 minutes round trip. There is no internet access on the property as described, however when we needed it, we were able to use our phone hotspot....most of the time.
The outdoors was even better than the house! The lake was freshly stocked with fish (although most we caught were on the small side) and we were able to take the pontoon boat out around the lake to see turtles, deer, cows, various waterfowl and hawks. We were able to hike around the lake and even take our .22 long rifle to do some target shooting. The deck came with an outdoor firepit along with wood for guest use, which was an amazing touch by the host.
We were very excited to get here and even more impressed when we did. We would recommend this spot to anyone looking for a quiet get away and are looking forward to our next visit!"

Stayed a few nights","You might not think Brooklyn, IA has much to offer and you may be right depending what you’re looking for. However, this house had everything to offer that we needed for a cousins + spouses weekend away. There are 4 private bedrooms and I believe accommodations for a few more if your group was larger.
Plenty of amenities like fridge and freezer space, grill, kitchen basics and more, no shortage of patio lounging space, everything needed to enjoy a fire, lots of yard space to get some competitive games of bags or Beersbee going, and more that we didn’t have time to enjoy. The pedal boats and red neck yacht (pontoon) were perfect touches to enjoy some time on the pond which is bigger than large. The cows mooing in the background always seemed to be perfectly timed.
The house and the pond are a fair distance down a decent hill but not insurmountable by any means, just be ready to work off that extra bit of pasta salad you ate. If you are sensitive to gravel, staying off the beaten path might not be for you but if you looking for a reason to prompt a car wash, go for it and enjoy the privacy this property offers.
Brett was a fantastic host. Always prompt in his replies as our trip date neared, punctual to meet us at the house for check in, informative showing us around the property and making sure we knew where everything was.
Thanks for the hospitality! Would stay again!"

Beyond the classy home, the pontoon boat, fire pits, patio , upper deck and wonderful hosts, Walnut Creek offers peaceful seclusion enhanced with breathtaking views of nature, sunsets and the Iowa countryside. We stay at different AirBnB's in natural settings once a month. And at each, we always plan on traveling to area wineries or small town attractions. But after arriving at Walnut Creek, we had no desire to leave. The fact that we booked it in October on our first day there, tells how impressed we were with every aspect of the resort. Brett is truly a super host and he and his wing man Roger made our stay a memorable one. Can't wait to return."

We were all excited about doing some fishing, and were not disappointed...in total we caught over 100 fish, including bass, catfish, bullheads, and bluegill! The kids liked fishing from the dock or even the shoreline, and of course, fishing from the boat was super fun as well. Brett and his wife were very hospitable and welcoming.

Group trip","The property was absolutely breath-taking. If you are an outdoors person this is definitely the place t o stay in Eastern Iowa. I had leased the lodge (best way to describe the feel of the place) to have a family celebration for my daughter's graduation from U of I, but those plans were changed due to COVID 19. I kept the booking because even though the live commencement had been cancelled, I still had to move her home from Iowa City.
The property is on over 300 acres of pristine land that has its on private Lake and surrounded by beautiful Hills and Woodlands. The area is an outdoor enthusiast dream. The private Lake has excellent fishing with large catfish and bass as well as bluegill and crappie.
The main attraction would probably be all the Wild game as I saw several pheasants quail and deer. There was also skeet shooting available but I only fish as I'm not a hunter but I was very happy with the amount of fish I hauled in over two days. The house itself is beautiful with a huge master suite and three other bedrooms all nice enough you satisfied to keep all my guess. I really want to thank Brett who personally made sure everything in our stay was perfect he came out to the house when we couldn't get them pontoon boat to start and fixed it immediately and was sure to point out all the amenities which I could not list in this blog I've been to many Airbnb's but this is one of my very favorites.
The actual house is fantastic with 4 bedrooms and bathrooms. The master suite is particularly wonderful, I would guess-tamate that including the sitting room it is around 1500 square feet. House has open floor-plan with plenty of space for 8-10 people to hang out. The house would be the high-light of most AIRBNB, but the surrounding property was my personal favorite, as I am an out-doors type person and this was a perfect fit. The only negative I would mention is having to drive a couple of miles on dirt/gravel roads to get to the property and it had rained. If you have AWD vehicle you will be fine. We have a RAV4 and we had no issues.
I really want to thank Brett who personally made sure everything in our stay was perfect.
