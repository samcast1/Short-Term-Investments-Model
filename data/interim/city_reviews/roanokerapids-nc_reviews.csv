Went to AirBNB on a whim and was SO lucky to find this place still available for the night! Deborah made the reservation process easy and gave us the door code so we could let ourselves in since we knew we would arrive late. The layout was great for our family with two teenage boys: One master with a queen sized bed, two bedrooms with two twin beds each."

Well, I guess you could bring it to an hotel, but here yo can actually play it in peace. :D On the way back out to the main highway I stopped and took a picture of some big cotton fields. Nice down-to-earth friendly folks. This is a great affordable clean place to reset between destinations. I plan to be back many more times! All the very best!"

If you're an astronomer, bring your telescope because the sky is very clear and free of contamination from smog or city lights. Gail & Jon are very nice folks too. Everything I needed. Feels like a mini vacation in the middle of a business trip. If you're into yoga or Pilates, bring your mat. Plenty of spots on the property where you can exercise outdoors and in nature. This is the 3rd time I'm here."

My children had a blast feeding the animals. We got to check on them everyday. They have a cute trail on the property, perfect for morning or evening strolls. The outdoor kitchen worked great for us. We actually received some fresh eggs from the host that we used for breakfast. The outdoor shower is a life saver on a hot day.
We got to visit the gift shop. They have a really cool concept, self sufficient farm, both creative people. Just overall a good time.

Stayed one night","I wish we could have spent several days here instead of just one night! I was a little worried since the bathhouse isn't attached to the cabin but it wasn't an issue at all. The bathhouse was probably the nicest detached bathroom/shower I've ever been in and the cabin was extremely comfy. Too comfy actually- we completely over slept and woke up 10 min before checkout. But they were so nice about it and still gave us a 40 min tour of their property and the different things they do to be self sustainable.
I would HIGHLY recommend!"

Highly recommend reading the local recommendations for food and activities as well - Medoc mountain, the cryptozoology museum, Lynch's BBQ, etc. make good nearby destinations.
Thanks for a lovely stay!"

Not only was it cozy and cute butwe learned a lot. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to other travelers."

I didn’t get a chance to meet Gail but I did speak to her husband John both mornings and he is a very nice man. The cabin and bathhouse are very nicely built.
One of the chicken pens is situated fairly close to the cabin. If you are not familiar with Roosters be prepared to wake up to his crowing at the crack of dawn….I have them myself so it was a normally part of my day that I love.
Very cute place, would definitely stay here again."

The location is extremely well kept and fairly quiet for it being so near a road. The roosters will wake you up early if you need it too haha. The whole cabin is so quaint and stocked with many appliances. We only stayed for a rest stop but it was memorable and pleasant."

This place is a slice of heaven. The hosts of this property, Jonathan and Gail are the most kind-hearted people. They welcome you like family. During my stay, I gained so much knowledge on the farm from the both of them.
I honestly had a hard time leaving!!!!
I found so much peace & serenity walking the property. The best hosts hands down. I have now been able to stop talking about my visit since leaving. I will 100% be back.
The space had everything one could need and then some!
Such a warm, loving couple.
You have got to stop at the store and check out the amazing jewelry, gnomes and wooden cutting boards by both Jonathan, Gail, and Denise. I have received so many compliments on my earring made by Denise!
Such an amazingly refreshing stay. A very special one i will always remember!!!
There is so much more I could add but you should just experiencing it for yourself!! It will be blessed!
So much gratitude to you!"

Gail was extremely kind and accommodating when I needed to make last-minute changes to plans. I briefly ran into both Gail and Johnathan during my stay, and they were very friendly and helpful when I asked for good trails or restaurant recommendations nearby.

Stayed a few nights","We very much enjoyed Gail and Jon’s hospitality during our stay. We spent time hiking the local state park and visiting some restaurants in Littleton and Halifax, North Carolina. Really enjoyed living on a farm for a few days, and the hosts both took time to explain all the features and functionality of the facility. We were impressed with the large group fire pit area along with covered seating, ice maker and cooking facilities nearby. The farm was nicely decorated for Christmas and bathroom facilities were warm and cozy, including lots of toiletry supplies in case you forgot to bring yours. John and Gail have a wonderful home made artisan shop that we took advantage of – purchased some necklaces for the kids and a cutting board for home. We enjoyed lots of good conversation and felt right at home in this cozy beautiful cabin, with comfortable furniture and reliable light and heat. Heard Owls too. We will definitely visit again, and encourage others to do the same! Seasons, greetings!"

Staying at a place like this is exactly the kinda thing we needed! Checked in around 3 and was entertained, had time to relax and rest, and got to check out local restaurants recommended by John. The storefront is a must check out, i got some amazing earrings made by Gale and a one of kind cutting board made by John! :) Also ask for a bonfire, you won’t regret it. I’ll be back, and telling everyone I know about this place. Thanks guys! See you next time :)"

My wife and I arrived a little later then we hope but none the less John Gail’s husband came out to greet us and make sure we knew were to go as well as the amenities the property offered as we unfortunately did not part take in all the amenities they had to offer however they were very fun If you have kids,feeding chickens and rabbits etc. Our cabin the “sunflower” cabin was ideal for what my wife were looking for the cabin was toasty warm and had all amenities needed inside the cabin and out however at the time it was very dry out so we were not able to have a fire by the cabin but the property does have a communal fire pit which John was able to lite as well as provide fire wood for our stay. Overall our experience with Gail ad John was nothing short of amazing and warm these two have done an amazing job with the dream and we look forward to coming back. Thank you Gail and John for the warm hospitality"

If you stay here definitely ask for the farm tour, there is a $45 fee for a one hour overview of the homestead… worth it! I learned about rain water harvesting, gardening, growing meat rabbits and canning… even how to store canned goods!
The little farm store is a must! Definitely stop in and buy the pain balm. Everything is made by Gail and inexpensive.
Overall this place is a super unique, educational, clean airbnb! I just wish I could have stayed longer. Next time I will definitely utilize the fire pit and I’m taking an art class with Gail (the host!) she is a brilliant artist!
Thank you Gail and John! We will be back!"

i appreciated the poop bags but as a responsible pet owner i had my own and was afreaid to let me pets do anything there.

Stayed with kids","This house was a great place to stay for a night on our way to Maryland. It was very clean and we had a super easy check in/out process. The hosts were very informative, though it felt like all the messages were scheduled or copy/pasted as I messaged a few times and never actually got a response specific to my messages. Everything about this place was good but I don’t think it was worth the price we paid to stay there - for almost $200 for the night with added Airbnb fees etc ($120ish without fees) I had higher expectations for quality of bedding, towels, kitchen amenities, furniture. It’s a cute, clean place, but a bit pricey for what you get."

If you want a place to unwind from a long road trip of from living in a city this is perfect. Piggly wiggly supermarket 3 minutes away. Only thing is that the washing machine wouldn’t start.

We had a great time spinding time on the lake swimming and going down the slide. Also did some fishing in the canoe and kayak catching a few bass. Tje host made it easy to access the house and answered any questions and were available for us. We would definitely recommend this house!

Just have to make sure you take everything you want to have at the water down with you when you go, because you don’t want to go back and forth from the house a lot of times. You will be worn out!

We were grateful for how clean and accessible the house was upon our arrival. There is plenty to do at the house, including fishing off the dock, kayaking, spending time on the large deck soaking in the view, grilling, fire pit, etc. Inside, they have many board games, dvds, comfortable beds, and efficient air condition units. We were all a little sad to leave. This was a trip to remember and we are already thinking about when we can visit next! Thank you to the hosts for always responding promptly to our questions.

Stayed a few nights","We had a great stay! It was, by far, our favorite Airbnb rental so far. You’ll have everything you need and more while staying at this quiet lake house with a view. The home is clean and is decorated with a nice lake/outdoorsy theme. Amenities above and beyond are provided - we really loved all the decking, grill, washer and dryer (lol), kayaks, extra bedding, and stocked kitchen. The location is secluded, peaceful, and has a fantastic lake view. We saw (and heard) a huge variety of birds - an osprey even hung out on the swing bench. FYI: to get to the dock there is a dirt/gravel path and then wooden stairs. The dock area can get very sunny, so be prepared (hats, sunblock). There is a Food Lion grocery store about 12 minutes away for any necessities. If you’re deciding on whether or not to stay here - do it! You won’t regret it (you’ll love it!)."

Stayed with kids","We GREATLY enjoyed our stay at the Weekend Hooker! Sam and Jeremy’s lake home was both clean and simple. We didn’t need to look for things, had everything we needed, and nothing that we didn’t need. No clutter was very relaxing!
We loved that the beds were made up and ready for us, the bathrooms were well stocked with clean towels; washcloths, and toilet paper, and we enjoyed full access to the deck, grill, and dock.
Sam and Jeremy answered every message and question very quickly, thoroughly, and with excitement. Their guide within the Airbnb app gave great information about the local region as well.
We see why Sam and Jeremy are super hosts! We truly had a very relaxing and comfortable week enjoying swimming in the lake, fishing from the dock and from our boat which we were able to keep on their dock, relaxing in the swing, grilling on the deck, and playing cards. While there was a TV and DVD available we didn’t even need to turn it on. What a great first Airbnb experience for us . We highly recommend Weekend Hooker and plan on returning!"

Stayed with a pet","We enjoyed the stay at The Weekend Hooker very much. My family is six (and our dog) came here to celebrate my mother's 81st birthday.
The fire pit, decks and grill were such a pleasure for us! The overhanging trees made us feel quite secluded. The little touches of having dog treats, human treats and games was great. The indoor gas fireplace was more than ample heat and lovely to look at. While chatting by the fire, we played a game of ""how many ducks are in this room"" based on the decor (spoiler alert, it's 87).
A couple of things to note, as is clear in the description and photos: the bedroom is an upper loft with two queen beds and a circular staircase to the first floor (mom happily slept on the couch). The walk to the water is a lovely 200 steps. We knew mom wouldn't be able to do it, but the rest of us were fine (and more fit when we left than when we arrived, haha).
It was a great trip, we had the best communication with the host that we've ever had with Airbnb. looking forward to returning!"

From toys, movies, and board games for the kids to a fully stocked kitchen and a usable laundry room for this mama and a wonderful outside grilling space for my husband! The home was in impeccable condition and everything was very clean and well decorated. We love to fish so we were so delighted to only have to buy a little bait as everything else we needed was provided for us! When they say dog friendly they mean it! My pup was greeted with treats, toys, food/water bowls and her very own linens so she could still enjoy couch cuddles with the kids! I could write a book on this place but instead I encourage you to visit and see this special you place for yourself! We’ve found our “place” for sure and we will definitely be back!!! ❤️❤️❤️"

Stayed with a pet","Such a great relaxing stay. Had everything you needed and communication was a1!DoorDash worked there, couple things available during the day (the area itself shuts down early). No blinds/curtains on windows so not as much privacy as some may want, blinds only in bathroom but … there’s only one neighbor so unless there’s an issue … you shouldn’t really Cross paths or have anyone outside your windows/doors. Don’t forget your house slippers, carpet only upstairs where you’ll sleep. The fire-pit outside is excellent, you may have to buy wood at a local store. Can’t forget the dog amenities, that was truly appreciated! (Dog bowls, toys, snacks, towels, blankets). My dog Xena had a ball. These types of stays are definitely more enjoyable for us during the summer so we plan on returning, maybe with a few friends. So worth the trip! And very thankful for the price. It’s somewhere I can see us going to at least yearly, it’s added to my air BNB finds/gems. The view alone won us!

The house is private, clean and spacious with comfortable beds. We didnt use the kitchen for cooking but it seemed to be well stocked with supplies. The coffee and oatmeal was a nice touch.

Owners have provided lots of extras! Lake toys, dog blankets and toys, games etc.. Samantha was an excellent communicator & went out of her way to accommodate our needs. The beds upstairs are comfortable. It worked for our guys & would work for families but the open concept may not work for couples. We hope to rent this home again in hunting season or definitely in the summer!"

Stayed a few nights","This home and location has everything you need for a relaxing and memorable getaway. Literally everything we needed and wanted was right there, so we never even left the property during our 4 night stay except for walks along the road with our pooch. Based on the beautiful pictures online, we had packed food in case we decided to eat in, and Samantha and Jeremy had breakfast snacks and plenty of coffee - the one thing I had forgotten. Communication was fast and pleasant from booking to checking out, and they have created a wonderful getaway, even providing everything the dog needed too. They are SUPERHOSTS in every sense of the word, and we are so happy to have found their place. The mattresses were comfortable and shower had good pressure - 2 very nice details you don't always get or expect. The views from the decks and the dock were so serene and peaceful, we spent most of our time outside soaking it all in. One of the most enjoyable and restorative vacations we've had in a long time!"

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at this house could not have been any better. The hosts were on top of everything from the beginning, and were always easy to reach. They provided detailed info about the house and our stay, but answered any questions we had quickly. The house itself was super cute, and had more than enough space for our party of 4 (plus 2 doggies). We had great weather, so we spent way more time on the home's 2 story deck, than actually in the home, but that's just another plus! The loft has a deck off of it that made sleeping with the door open (screen door shut!), so much more comfortable given the breeze. The view from both of the decks was beautiful and the space was very private. Waterfront, with a huge dock that we were able to spread out on. There honestly isn't anything negative to say about this home, and we'd definitely return!"

Stayed a few nights","Had a fantastic few days together on our “babymoon” before the arrival of our first daughter! The dogs enjoyed the lake so much and it was so quiet. We didn’t see another human while on the property—only the forest critters like birds, fish, frogs, a snake, and a praying mantis bid us goodbye as we were packing up. Really needed a good reset in nature and this is perfect for nature lovers.
Hosts Jeremy/Samantha were so sweet and generous with their amenities for us and the doggies and even some gifts for baby Liana when she arrives to the world. There was plenty of space indoors and outdoors for us and our 3 pups and we enjoyed our time from eating breakfast on the deck as the sun rose, splashing in the lake, trying our luck at fishing, playing board games, playing horseshoes outside, watching/streaming movies on the tv (we brought a laptop and hdmi cord and the hotspot wifi was plenty strong to watch!), and exploring the great outdoors. You can’t go wrong with this place if you love nature with some comforts of back home!"

We have a family of 5 and we all fit comfortably into the cabin/house. The Weekend Hooker offers a great view of the lake, with a great dock for your boat, a huge deck, fire pit, horse shoe pit and many other amenities. All you need to bring other than clothing and personal items is food. Everything else is provided. There is over 150 DVD's for you to utilize if you are into staying indoors. I rated them 5 stars because that is the highest rating I could give. I will stay at the Weekend Hooker again, and yes i would recommend this place to friends and family!!!!!!!"

This place is just as the pictures describe-- a beautiful lake view from a fabulous series of decks offering a great outdoor space, including a fire pit and hike down to the dock. Your hosts are super attentive and want you to enjoy your stay- there are lots of good recommendations of things to do and see. We hiked in Medoc Mountain State Park and the Roanoke Rapids Trail, in addition to driving to historic Halifax and venturing out onto the lake in the canoe and kayaks."

First of all Samantha was so fast at responding ( i mean literally within minutes I would get a message back) but that was just the icing on top of a great place. The place is really private. There is one neighbor but never even knew they were there. They made the place SO cozy. A super comfortable living room with a nice fire place and an awesome view. The loft was so cozy too, but the main feature of the house was a multilayer deck in the back of the house that would be perfect for the summer. There was comfortable patio furniture on each level, which would have been great for entertaining. there was horseshoes set up outside a nice relaxing swing that looked over the lake . There was also full access to the lake just steps away.
The best part for me was it was dog friendly. the pups had a great time and they even provided blankets, bowls, and toys.
I cant wait to stay there again.

Wanted a trip out of town (we live a few hours away) and was able to get up there, and spend a quiet weekend, while it seems like on maps you’re close to a lot of other people, it didn’t really feel that way because oh where the house sits. A beautiful bridge is within sight you
Can go under and access the main lake.
Took paddle boards out myself and enjoyed the calm of their secluded arm of the lake, but if you were motorized, you’re still *very close* to the main lake.
Definitely not walkable to a store or anything like that, but didn’t expect it, they left us a cute note to welcome us and were very responsive. We had a couple friends with us and enjoyed using the fire pit out back as well before sunset. Didn’t even see that many people on the lake, but there are some barking dogs on the other side of the lake.
Kitchen was clean, was able to make our small dinner. Steps were a little steep on the stairs but otherwise no complaints."

The home is a few minutes walk to the main street, where we found the Trophy Room bar where we were able to unwind a bit and have a drink or two with some of the very friendly locals. Glenn was very responsive and her home was clean and comfortable."

Glenn was great to work with and I can't wait to go back and try their restaurant."

Regrettably, we were unable to peruse the area due to time constraints. We did pass some of the highlighted places on the way in. Our later check-in prevented our meeting Glenn in person, which was a disappointment as he appears to be very enthusiastic of the area amd community.
The cottage reflects the atmosphere of the locale. We are hoping to be able to visit again and take time for exploration."

Stayed with a pet","This quaint cottage in historical Halifax is a treasure. We arrived in a cold spell and found the place pleasantly warm and cozy. Loved the location, quiet, peaceful, clean. The big back yard was a plus for our pup to get a little exercise; and he enjoyed seeing the many deer back there in the morning. Our bed was wonderful. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed the original features of this place that have been well preserved by Glenn. Felt like living in a piece of history and we love that. The modern touches ( the microwave and coffee pot made a great breakfast) were nice, too. The second bedroom would be super for a family with kids. And a walk or drive around nearby town is fantastic. So much packed into this little place. We will be returning."

Glenn is thoughtful in how the house is set up and makes it very comfortable for the guests! It is always very clean. There is also a large back yard for the pups to run around in. We initially picked it because it was an easy off/on to I-95. The town has a lot of history and a great restaurant the Hen and the Hog. We will be back again next year!

The town was quiet at night, making it the perfect, peaceful stay...a great way to recharge before the second half of our trip. The Hen & The Hog restaurant was fantastic. The staff was so friendly, and they accommodated dietary restrictions well. Also, possibly the smoothest Old Fashioned and the tastiest flourless chocolate cake I've had! The cottage offered a charming step back in time, but updated with modern luxuries, like comfortable mattresses and locally-roasted ground coffee. The cleanliness and organization was particularly outstanding."

Glenn left us some bottles of water in the fridge and some locally bagged coffee.

Stayed with a pet","This is a gem of a house in a gem of an historic town. The Halifax Resolves, a precursor to the Declaration of Independence, were adopted here. There are lots of nicely restored historic buildings and some beauties just waiting to be taken on as a project. Glenn has created a very welcoming space with lots of nice touches, such as antiques, the table set for a meal, a new bag of coffee next to the coffee maker and a fresh sponge next to the sink. The backyard is very large and our dog loved it. The were thrilled the house still has the feel of a vintage property. It is all on one level and easy to access. The floors are a little uneven, as might be expected, but could be an issue for some. N.B. If I had read the listing more carefully, I might have realized there is no stove. There is a microwave and toaster oven, as well as a slow cooker. We were only there for one night, but we enjoyed a couple of walks around the town. Glenn is a very responsive host. We hope to be back one day."

Stayed a few nights","*Communication is terrible*
Very little responses after you book. After that you're on your own.
Instructions on how to get in the house were not on air bnb and I had to ask..
Because i came from NY late i didn't have a tour or anything but that was not an issue at all. Its pretty much self-explanatory inside.
Cold water didn't work and wasn't fixed until days after I got there. Not a big deal but I had to buy bottled water to drink.
This place is nice. However, its in the middle of nowhere and meant for short stays given the location.
* I felt like I was living in the country ghetto.*
The red couch had multiple springs that were stabbing me.. they need to throw that thing out and get a new one.
** They have a mandatory cleaning service WEEKLY.** Someone comes in and cleans or whatever. I didn't get any response on the details and I asked if that was necessary and he said yes because he already paid her. I asked if she could come there when im off work since I only work 3 days a week. NO response... i don't want someone touching my personal belongings or washing my 300$ comforter that can't be machine washed..
I ended up leaving my reservation early due to work circumstances. So I still don't know what exactly the cleaner does when she cleans. I didnt get clear instructions on what she does. Trash removal? Vacuuming? I just don't know what else she would be doing. I think its unnecessary and uncomfortable when I can't lock my things up when she's there.
**In a nut shell.. this was the worst airbnb I've ever been to and worse communication by far. **"

The host were very flexible because I was traveling from a few states away and arrived late. I would definitely stay again."

It’s not the mountains and the property doesn’t really have trails etc. And that drive to town is 20ish minutes. The decor is on POINT! Very impressed with the decor. Outside space is vast. However, there was no firewood (no biggie…we assumed there would be) and the string lights didn’t work (don’t know if owner is aware). Overall, I’d go back for a night or two. It’s quiet and the stars are amazing l!"

Master bed was comfy, the outside light only shone of the side of the house with no windows and there was nearly no traffic. We were disappointed with the cleanliness however: kitchen counters had food spills, mirrors were splattered with toothpaste, hair in sink, etc. With a deep clean, this would be the perfect gem!"

The house itself is beautiful and comfortable. It looks small outside but feels big inside. One bed was softer and the other pretty firm. I had the firm one, which I didn’t love, but was fine for one night.
We liked the place so much that we are trying to come up with excuses to go back! We were only there the night so we didn’t get to enjoy it long. It is by far our favorite house on our road-trip so far. It’s set a pretty high bar for the rest of our accommodations.

We almost extended our vacation by a day just so that we could enjoy the place for longer than the 14 hours (minus 8 for sleep) we were there so that we could take full advantage of the awesome back yard area (firepit, games, outdoor TV). What a beautiful setting, too, with large cottonfields across the street and trees everywhere -- no other houses in sight. If we ever do another trip down 95 I know where we'll be staying!"

We were on a long road trip from Boston to Florida with two kids and two dogs. Needless to say, we wanted space, quiet and to relax. Jessica and David’s place was perfect. We’re out in the country far enough that we could really see the stars, the house is beautiful, and the outdoor space is perfectly curated with outdoor tv, darts and a fire pit.
We were so pleasantly surprised that we wish we had more days to stay.
I will also note that you are out by yourself with very little around. So - we were thrilled when we rolled the dice on one of the hosts recommendations for dinner and it was very good.
All in all, we will go back if we’re ever in the area."

The hosts never answered any of our messages, even asking about the surprise fish in the house plant bowl, but luckily we never needed anything major. Once we realized they did not respond we did not send any more communication except letting them know when we checked out.
Mobility Awareness: There is no clear path leading from the back pad area to the grass yard through the rocks. Steady yourself or get a hand to help you over them. They can shift and be slick."

Pristine clean, spacious, peaceful, great western themes, and comfortable. The back porch had a great firepit, string lights, dart board and set a great environment. Hats off to the hosts who went to great lengths on every detail of the house from spacious showers, awesome coffee station, to spacious kitchen. Even the rocking chairs on the front porch were a brilliant ending to my morning coffee as I saw a deer across an open field grazing while I sipped on my 1st cup of coffee this morning.

so first of all.... THE SCENERY! Wide Open spaces all around! You'll drive down a long dirt road (cause who doesn't love that!!!) and then BAM! THIS big, beautiful white house!!!
It's just stunning! The landscaping and pebble-lined walkway just give you that feeling that you're about to encounter something special!
OPEN THE DOOR.... Beautiful decor! I MEAN GORGEOUS! Huge OPEN floor plan and the most BEAUTIFUL KITCHEN stocked with EVERYTHING one would need to cook the perfect meal! The BACK YARD would probably be my favorite! HUMONGOUS FIRE-PIT beyond the beautifully paved patio! AND A BIG SCREEN TV ! OUTSIDE! This place is just SO SO special. I could go on! PLEASE CHECK IT OUT! You will not be disappointed!!!!!!"

Stayed one night","You definitely want to book here!
I can't speak highly enough of this place. We absolutely loved our stay here. Everything was clean, there was every amenity we needed, there was a super cozy living room, there were board games and WiFi, and a grill and fire pit outback (and even a dart board and a huge TV!). It was the perfect place to spend our afternoon/evening. I'd even rent this place to literally just hang out there for the weekend as a getaway from home.
The only ""cons"" were the beds- the spring mattresses had us tossing and turning, but I wouldn't let that stop me from going back. Maybe I'd bring my mattress topper and my own pillows or something. I also wasn't a fan of the Betta bowl on the counter; I've been a pet care provider for about 12 years and I always hate to see pets with outdated care (Betta's need full tanks and filters like every other fish!).
All that being said, I would return here a million times as a halfway point to spend time with my parents!"

Stayed one night","Great little big little getaway, the full moon and the starts are amazing, while sitting next to the warmth of the fire pit. This little house is beautifully decorated with Western and Country theme with a touch of industrial. We felt at home the minute we arrived. The details in the home gave the perfect finishing touch. Keep in mind that the house is about 70 ft off of the road so you will have cars passing by, and if you are staying on a weekend during hunting season, there is a group of hunters that will park across the street to hunt in the hunting club land near by. We went to a local barbecue place, brought it back and enjoyed dinner around the fire pit. Some may think that the price point after additional fees might be a bit high but the house is immaculately decorated and it's a perfect seclusion getaway, and if that's what matters to you then this place is perfect! The only thing missing is a hot tub to soak in under the stars."

The bedrooms are comfy and spacious. You really get a lot of bang for your buck here. The only complaint we had is the proximity of the house to the road. The house is maybe 50 yards off of the road and therefore feels a little bit more exposed to the road than other houses in the area. Overall this is a great place to get away and experience nature."

I didn’t realize how close the lake is to the house! The view is breathtaking and relaxing! My husband woke up the next morning at 5:45AM looking for me and of course I was by the lake! I was setting up a cozy bon fire to enjoy breakfast around. I saw fisherman on the lake as the steam fog engulfed their surroundings. I got beautiful pictures! The house was very tidy and cozy. Blankets and bed were so soft and comfortable. The kitchen was fully stocked and we were welcomed with snacks, bottled water and a card upon arrival. We will keep this place on our list to revisit in the future."

Renee was an amazing host that was there when we needed her and to check in to make sure we had everything we needed. Communication was excellent all around! Details of the house that she provided was exact and she allowed us to know where things were - even the volume button on the side of the remote! lol.

I most enjoyed sitting out back on the screened in porch and deck overlooking the lake. Renee was an exceptional host and provided all of the amenities that I needed. I will definitely book this home again in the near future.

Stayed with a pet","This host was so informative and very kind. This place was absolutely perfect for me as I was stopping through with my small dog on my way back to New Jersey from Georgia. I didn’t need the 3 bedrooms since it was just me, but it was a comfortably sized house for one person to not be too scared alone 😅.
The yard is so spacious for my dog to potty and stretch her legs. They even provide a few doggie bags which was thoughtful. I always have my own but it was a nice extra touch.
I stayed in the room on the first floor right next to the driveway so that I could be near my car (which was packed to the brim) in case of an emergency.
The kitchen is the equivalent to what you’d expect at a hotel that offers a continental breakfast. Equipped with the basics of disposable materials, coffee machine, microwave, and fridge.
The linen was laid out perfectly upstairs and the shower was so nice and hot. Everything was great. Thanks again!"

Group trip",Everything went ok until our bed frame collapsed at 1:30AM. Both of us could have been injured as our heads ended up under the headboard. We had great difficulty getting our bodies out of this situation. We ended up sliding the mattress down the steps and putting it on the floor in the den to sleep. One of the persons has a back problem and was very uncomfortable. The worse part was not getting any kind of a response from the owners when I reported the incidence. Needless to say we will not be staying at broken bed air bnb again.

It is conveniently located within walking distance of the lovely little shops and eateries in Littleton, NC. We loved the layout and the kitchen was perfect for light snacks and meals. The only drawback for us (at 70 years old) was having only one bathroom on the second floor. However, we made it work and it is still, overall, a lovely place to stay. We do plan to return.
There is also a nice deck and barbecue grill in the backyard. Parking is a breeze with a wide driveway next to the house. A great value for the price!"

Stayed with kids","Overall the stay was fine. It was supposed to be my husband, daughter and I for a work event he had going on, but I ended up having something come up so it was just him. He arrived a little early so I messaged to see if he could check in, I also sent the photos of the exterior damage like Gavin had asked. I never got a response from anyone. I got automated messages about check out towards the end of the stay, but never did I get a message from someone on the other end. The stay itself was fine he said other than the house could use a mirror downstairs as well and that it is not very private- very out in the open, but otherwise it was fine. Glad he didn’t have any issues since we were unable to reach the host. As a host myself, I try to be very responsive to guests knowing that this is an important aspect of the hosting process."

Minimal kitchen which was made clear, but only paper plates and plastic eating utensil dispensers on the wall. My biggest problem was that the queen bed was on the first floor, but the only bathroom was on the second floor. I would have liked to have known the bathroom was upstairs. Just be aware. If was fine for a short stay."

Stayed with a pet","House was clean and comfortable and had everything we needed for a short stay. Check-in was easy. Gavin provided lots of helpful information. Loved that the place was pet friendly, and the grassy area outside was perfect for our dog to run around. This was the first airbnb I've stayed at (and there have been many) that provided paper plates and plastic utensils instead of actual dishware. I think having coffee mugs, plates, wine glasses, etc. (and also a sponge, dish soap, and a kitchen towel to help keep the place clean) would greatly enhance the experience. Also, I found the kitchenette area and the shower to be quite dark. Other than that, the place worked out well for an overnight stay, and I would book again if I'm in the area!"

Very clean and the host, Gavin is so communicative. We got tips about where to eat and things to do in the area before arrival. The place is quiet and easily accessible. Our son left his bag and Gavin was great about letting us know and arranging for us to get the bag back. We did not bring our dog this trip but will in the future. The place was pet friendly but did not smell like it was a home with pets. The home has one bathroom which worked for 3 males and a female. We will definitely stay again! Do try the new Mexican restaurant just down the street. The steak asada fries were delicious and it stays open until 10! Great place, great host."

Stayed a few nights",Awesome from start to finish! House is adorable! Totally spotless! You were great right from the start with all the info of the neighborhood but when we walked in and saw the mints and dog treats even the extra leash by the backdoor I thought that was so very thoughtful and I didnt even bring my fur babies! House is private and set back but right in the middle of everything! We will be back for sure thank you so much for sharing your home 💜🦋

The kitchen cupboards were labeled so things were easy to find. We appreciated the tea and coffee station set up for us to be able to take a hot beverage with us in the morning. There was even some treats for our dog which was very thoughtful. Gavin was very response when we had questions.

I was grateful to find this lovely place. From the constant communication with Gavin who was very descriptive on where everything was. It was 2 mins from my family which I loved they even mentioned using the place when other family visits. Overall very accommodating and everything you need in one place. If you need something to do Gavin will give you the rundown of the town events. Endless knowledge was a definite bonus. We definitely will be visit again 💖"

Gavin provided us with local information about the town we were staying in, and his home was set up well with towels, soaps, as well as a Keurig. The beds were comfy and we were so glad to be able to bring our pups with . It's a nice area and I loved being close to nature ( I saw some deer run by in the early a.m.) We would definitely stay here again and really appreciate how informative Gavin was !"

The owners have included thoughtful touches throughout to make you feel like a true guest. The place is spacious and was spotless. It was so clean that you wouldn’t have known they allow pets. As other reviewers have noted, the only bathroom is upstairs and it’s small, but we didn’t mind. The location wasn’t quite as situated in the neighborhood as we thought. Otherwise, everything was well represented, and check-in/check-out was a breeze. I gave it 4 stars on value, but I assume our price reflected that we visited during the high season at nearby Lake Gaston. Very good stay overall, and we will likely return."

I enjoyed the cleanliness, the wood floors, the simple style of furnishing, the fluffy towels, and big back yard and deck. If you are staying long, bring a hotplate or a grill. As well as pots and pans, plates and bowls, spatulas, serving spoons etc. And if you don't like to cook, don't fret bc there are a couple nice restaurants within 1 minute of driving/3 minute walk. The restaurants have bubbly staff and everyone I met in Littleton treated me like a friendly neighbor. This area has a very special local history so go out, meet the locals, and enjoy the upcoming lake season!"

The entire unit is immaculately clean and the use of high quality disposable utensils, including coffee cups and dishes, minimizes the risk of transmitting bacteria. Sanitizing products, including, wipes and hand cleaners, are also readily available. Not only did the unit exceed our discriminating standards for cleanliness, but everything else was five star - including high end comfortable beds and furniture and fluffy towels. Finally, the unit is easy to find and in a quiet area. Our host was great - very accommodating and attentive to our needs. We know Super Hosts work hard to achieve their rating and we appreciated the personal attention, such as texts to inform us of places to eat and shop. Way to go Gavin! Thanks for making your rental available to us. Ray and Debby"

So, didnt  alert him of other concerns- none he could resolve then,anyway.
As Airbnb hosts & as guests ourselves, below reflects OUR  PREFERENCES for guests' ease/comfort. Most future guests may find L's house meets their needs.Others may benefit from our notes BELOW:
No guest guide for suggestions, 'where stuff is', POI, use of roku/appliances.   
the  2023  reviews  re: unfinished queen room/full bath still unresolved. A work-in-progess, as is the pleated plastic ill sliding door to bedr; +both toilet seats wobble.
a syrupy overpowering  scent.  Found/removed plug-ins in each room, opened doors;still evident when we left 
 
Old clumped leaves/oak 'worms' covered deck/furniture, despite brisk winds.
L-room lacks lamps  at either end of either of the two sofas. Only overhead-same w/ kitchen/dining table.Soft lighting more inviting!"

Stayed with kids",We travelled from Rochester NY to Myrtle Beach and chose here to stay on way down instead of a hotel. It’s was perfect for our family. We have three young kids and the huge fenced in backyard was a hit! After 9.5 hours in the car- they got to run around and we got to sit on the deck and relax. My 2.5 year old loved the little tent and blocks in the children’s room. We very much appreciated the coffee and waters.

Stayed with a pet","The house is in a quiet and safe-feeling neighborhood. There is a large fenced-in backyard that would be great if you're traveling with dogs. You can tell that a lot of work was put into this house, but like other reviewers have said it feels a little unfinished. Especially the back bedroom. For example, the paint job is really splotchy and there is no baseboard / floor moulding so you can see the space between the wall and the floor. There were a few other minor things like that. Those things aside, the hosts did a great job decorating and the bed was comfy and clean. A tip for the door lock keypad: First press the bottom right area where the # sign is and the keypad will light up. then type in your code and press # again."

Room for growth: Feels like full bath and back bedroom are partway through being remodeled. Keyless lock has a delay after each number is pressed making getting in a bit of a challenge but not impossible.
ALSO, and I hesitate to put this because it could happen to any of us and hopefully will be quickly resolved, there was a very active and very loud critter in the walls and ceiling of the home that woke us up early in the morning. I’m hoping Leslie and Brian will be able to resolve that soon.
Overall, we’re grateful this property is available for the area!"

Check in was completely flexible, communication was very clear and punctual, and all the amenities were amazing. There’s plenty of hot water to be able to actually draw yourself a bath, heaters galore in each of the room, and they were Vene thoughtful enough to turn on the lights for us when we let them know we’d be checking in late.
We stayed cozy through our trip, and let our pups roam the yard. There’s lots of space and plenty to keep yourselves entertained, and lots of incentive to relax and unwind.
My only complaint is that I could t stay longer!
10/10 recommend and I would absolutely go back!"

Stayed with a pet","We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Harrell’s cabin. We live at the beach and went for some much needed quiet time in the country. The location is private, very little traffic, yet only a few minutes drive to town. We didn’t need any assistance during our stay, but the hosts are right up the road. The bed was very comfortable. Great fire pit which we used every night. Beautifully decorated for the season. The outdoor lights on the back porch and around the fire pit allow you to enjoy the outdoors into the night. Nice bed swing on the back porch. Variety of coffees and teas available. Very pet friendly with bowls and toys available. Our dog enjoyed her stay as well with plenty of room to run and play. We will stay again in the future. Thank you for your hospitality!"

Stayed a few nights","Jessica and David’s cabin was just lovely. Very private which I appreciated, seamless checkin and the bathroom tub is glorious! I also had a minor wifi issue (literally just needed to unplug and plug but I’m not tech savvy and was attempting on the incorrect device). And Jess and David were super response in spite of the fact that it was late at night. The bed was very comfortable which is always worth noting in my book. There’s not much around closeby but I was just looking for a quiet private space and drove about 30-45 minutes to find some light hiking trails so it worked great for me. Would recommend!"

Stayed with a pet","I can’t say enough good things about this charming cabin cottage. Don’t hesitate to book it! We were driving from south Florida to NWPA and booked it very last minute with our dogs, because we were initially just going to stay at a hotel overnight, but after 12 hours in the car, we wanted our dogs to be able to stretch their legs and run a bit off lead. This home was perfect! The back porch was so charming and the swing was comfy. I only wish we could’ve stayed longer.
We got in at 8pm and left by 6am, but the dogs had a blast doing zoomies in the sizable living space and outside, before going to bed. When I had a question, I felt bad texting after 8pm, but they got back to me right away without hesitation. If I’m ever in that part of Virginia for a couple of days, I hope to stay there again. It’s simply lovely. Thank you for letting us stay!"

The floor is in need of a serious deep clean as well.
They have all the accommodations for a five-star locale but the grime just needs to be dealt with.
.
One last thing that Might be disgusting is the request that when you leave to put the garbage in the garbage pail, no problem, but when I opened the garbage pail there were other bags of garbage there it smelled of maggots and seemed as though the garbage hadn’t been removed in weeks.
Other than that, we like the place. Jessica and David were very helpful being available for questions."

Stayed with a pet","We absolutely loved the Cabin! It was so relaxing, we felt right at home. The cabin was so open and airy.
We loved the yard too! There was so much room for our dogs to run and the road is quiet with not much traffic.
We can’t wait to come back again when it is warmer to enjoy the back porch!
We were so relaxed when we left. It truly is a special little gem.😃"

Stayed with a pet","Feels peaceful and serene. Very cozy vibes. Love the outdoor covered porch and snuggled in the swing with my guitar for a couple hours/ perfect weather for the cabin!
I’ve stayed a few times. Perfect for my southbound travels just off I95 in VA. Next time maybe I’ll light up the fire pit…. My traveling Animals LOVE this place."

Stayed with a pet","Thanks for hosting us! Pros were comfy beds, great kitchen and bathroom, and place all to ourselves. Cons were bed sheets had not been washed, we arrived at night so there were a lot of dark roads when getting to the airbnb, it’s located not too far from a jail, and broken blinds did not allow for privacy."

Stayed with a pet","My stay was great, place was clean, dog friendly and quaint. I did not have time to enjoy the fire pit but it looked very relaxing.
A little further out from the interstate than I expected, but that added to the charm.
Restaurant or stores are not very close, which also added to the adventure.
Wish I had more time, great stay and my dogs loved it."

Stayed a few nights","Beautiful, calm, quiet. Fire pit was wonderful. Warm bathroom was amazing in the cold weather. It wasn’t nearly as clean as we expected, and the cabin didn’t keep much heat inside, but the location made it very much worth it. Owners responded quickly and were very polite. Definitely want to come back in warmer weather."

Stayed with a pet","Jessica and David's place is a hidden gem. We arrived at night, so it was dark as we drove off 95 toward's their cabin. When we woke up we found it quiet and tucked away near the local church. There wasn't any neighbors within view so we had our privacy. Our pup (which Jessica and David allowed) had a fun sniffari in the backyard. The cabin is great for a family with two huge beds side by side and a large open area to lounge around in and chat. We would stop and stay here again if the need arose."
