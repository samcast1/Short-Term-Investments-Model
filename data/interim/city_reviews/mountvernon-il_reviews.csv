Stayed a few nights","Wildwood felt like a home away from home. The property is a stunner with a full deck, fire pit, and lake. The home itself is in immaculate condition. The bedroom accommodations were spacious and private. Jensena was a fantastic host who even had pizza and drinks waiting for us upon arrival. This is definitely one of my favorite air bnb’s. We look forward to another stay when we come home to visit. Five stars!"

The mark this place left on our hearts.. will be forever. The peace and serenity that was felt throughout the whole place ... it's all around. Jen, is a GREAT host- the house had everything you could imagine- she left snacks, drinks, s'mores basket for us! Her daughter also left some space related toys bc we were up for the eclipse. I don't have one negative thing to say! Thank you Jen for everything!"

Stayed a few nights","Jensena’s cabin was just as pictured and described. The rooms are very spacious and clean. There was a welcome basket upon arrival which was a nice surprise and the house is well stocked with the essentials. Fishing poles and kayaks provided added entertainment for the pond and the fire pit was lovely in the evening. Jensena responded quickly to any questions we had and was extremely helpful when we had a medical issue on the first day there. The area around the cabin is private and quiet. We saw several deer, turtles, herons and fish while we were at the cabin. It was a very nice relaxing week. We would definitely stay again if in the area."

Add in the strolling turkeys and grazing deer. And then the special event of the 17-year cicadas. I cannot wait to return for another visit. Truly a special place with a wonderful host.

Stayed with a pet","After two grueling Days on the road from Florida with two senior chihuahuas I arrived at a different Airbnb only to find it was occupied by somebody else. Due to my situation I needed to find someplace to stay quickly, the Main Street Bungalow was a last minute reservation for me and a blessing in disguise! The furnishings in the home are tasteful and my bed and bedding extremely comfortable. Ryan was never intrusive and addressed my needs immediately and at my convenience, I was feeling a little spoiled. I felt safe in the home and the location was near lots of places for shopping and great places to eat out. I personally love all things vintage and this home was no exception. Take a chance with Ryan at the Main Street Bungalow, you will not be disappointed!"

Stayed with kids","Overall, rating this an okay stay could be considered generous. I think we may have just had a series of mishaps that just soured the experience a little for us but i'm not sure. The more I think about this space and our experience the more I wonder if I am just being overly kind. I'm not sure that my experience is a reflection of the usual happenings here but as a super host myself, I owe it to future guests to report my experience so here we go.
The host has you enter through the back door, which is fine but it was pouring rain so we had to traipse through the muddy, wet grass (with a newborn) so just be prepared for that especially in snowy or rainy weather. There is no path...just grass. Kitchen has very little counterspace, so most food prep will have to be done on the kitchen table. We didn't stay long enough to cook, but something I noticed. Huge pantry off the kitchen appeared to have some fun stuff in it like (if I remember correctly) a crockpot, large roasting pan and coffee maker (among other things). Speaking of coffee...there was none. We found a canister that had a few coffee grounds in it. It certainly smelled like coffee....had evidence of coffee grounds in the past...just no coffee in it currently. Apparently coffee isn't listed as an amenity which is weird since there is coffee filters and creamer and sugar packets. Anyway, coffee places nearby...or bring your own grounds.
Speaking of kitchen...there was like 6 pieces of mouse poop in the kitchen sink and one right next to the sponge. I brought this to the host's attention. To his credit, he offered to send a cleaner over right away who could clean the kitchen as well as bring us more towels since I pointed out there were only 2 bath towels despite there being 3 adults and a baby booked for the night. I declined the cleaner as it was 11 pm and my sister (with her newborn) were already in bed after our long day of travel. I decided to let him bring the towels because he was only 5 minutes away and was trying to make it right and I felt bad. Upong arrival with clean towels, host was very apologetic, sincere and kind, which I really appreciated. However, we discovered the next morning, after three days of travel, we were unable to use the towels our host brought as the Airbnb did not provide shower gel, shampoo or conditioner (which I normally travel with but of course I forgot on this trip)....so I *guess* it's not his fault, however rough for us after 3 days of not showering.
Sheets in one bedroom were pilly and, therefore, rough like sandpaper. I was going to sleep on the futon, but discovered I ""couldn't"" because the house manual requested I only do so with the sheets and bedding provided. Spare bedding was suppose to be in drawers under the queen bed but were nowhere to be seen. My 42-yo self ended up sleeping in the bed with my 72-yo mom. Good thing we like each other. Probably worked out okay because both the living room couch and the futon would not have been comfortable overnight unless you are under 100 lbs.
I don't know....maybe I screwed this one up. Maybe I didn't pay close enough attention to things like the $100 cleaning fee WHICH IS RIDICULOUSLY HIGH. Maybe I should have done a street view of the area first to see if the area was sketchy. Perhaps I should have checked amenities to see if they would have the BASIC stuff a hotel would have like shampoo, conditioner and coffee. As an Airbnb Superhost myself, I feel like I should take the blame for all of my many mistakes in choosing this location. But then again, maybe they could just do better. I dunno. You decide. For me? 10/10 would not stay again. Too many things went wrong. Cost was excessive for what it was. Location 5/10. Thank god it was only one measly night."

My husband loved the comfortable beds and he’s picky. 😆 The checkout procedures were very easy and simple. One of the least things you have to do which I love.
You have to go to the Farmhouse for breakfast/lunch. They have some yummy things. ☺️"

While there are train tracks nearby, I did not find this to be a disruption. I sleep with a bedside fan and never noticed the trains at night. The bed I slept in was very comfortable, and the place was very clean. Would definitely recommend this location to others."

Stayed one night","I played a gig at the Granada Theatre and this was the absolute perfect location to be able to run back and forth to change and then at the end of the night, I didn’t have to drive really far to get back — it was literally a 60 second drive! Super clean, great decor, really comfy bed - just be ready for the trains that go through all night. I was tired enough that they didn’t keep me up, but if that kind of thing bothers you, they were super kind and actually provided ear plugs! Highly recommend!!!"

I would suggest to parents of light sleepers to bring some sort of white noise because a train runs very close blowing the horn. The host actually thought of that and provided ear plugs if needed. We are not light sleepers, so were not bothered at all, but it may have kept my kids up when they were little."

The decor was thoughtful and they included some considerate extras, like a full Brita pitcher and toiletries. The bed was comfy and we didn’t have any issues with noise or light (admittedly, we were really sleepy after a 16 hour drive!) I can’t comment on the local area since it was a very quick overnight, but it seemed walkable to some cute parts of downtown Mt Vernon. Overall, highly recommend."

Stayed with a pet","Just a short jog from the freeway and close enough to town for supplies. Rosemary and family provided all the basic necessities (tp, paper towels, handsoaps) which is very helpful when traveling across the country. The house is large, yard is even bigger, and set away from the roadway. Very private despite being on a state high way. Beds are comfortable! The house was clean and had all we needed for the evening. The driveway has plenty of space for trailers and turning around."

Upstairs living and dining room with bonus downstairs ( only a few steps ) living and dining area. Close to town but just far enough away to be peaceful. Well stocked for our visit with a few thoughtful extras. Will stay again next time we visit. Yard was well kept. Everyone loved it. Rosemary always replied immediately to my couple questions.

It was so lovely to drink coffee on the bench and look at the water!

We had purchased a house and ran into some issues with the closing and she was understanding and accommodating to the changing needs they surrounded it. We had to make a change to the dates twice and she understood and worked with us through both of them. She responded to every message that was sent quickly and politely, but more important to us personably. Truly a great host and would recommend to anyone going through the area."

Stayed with a pet","We stayed here overnight on a roadtrip, but we would have enjoyed staying longer with a bigger group. The grounds were gorgeous with a lovely front and back yard--my mom's dog LOVED it. The house itself was immaculate, nicely decorated (even if not to my taste) with a great layout for a family. Check-in and check-out was a breeze.
A couple of things to note:
- There is no TV. The listing does not claim there is, just be aware.
- The driveway is a bit difficult to find when driving at night since it is off of a highway with cars driving at relatively high speeds. (You couldn't hear cars from the house, thankfully.) The house number is on a mailbox next to a dirt/gravel road. It would be helpful if they were larger or lit up somehow.
- The balcony door from one of the bedrooms is locked. This was a bummer for me since the balcony was a major draw for me, and I chose both this property and my bedroom for access to it.
Overall great though! Recommended."

They had small trails, a Hammock area by the trails, a pond with fish you can feed, and a fire pit area among many other things - those are just the things we participated in! Although the cabin is on their property, it feels private. We were there on a Sunday, but if you go any other day they have a community of farm stores and farm eaterys around them to enjoy. They also had so many amenities to make us feel comfortable and cozy. You can tell they put a lot of love into the place. I would stay again if I we come back through the area!"

Great thought was put into making the guest feel comfortable and relaxed by what’s provided and available: indoor cooking, outdoor cooking everything except the food is there. Nice creature comforts, personal touches everywhere.
Not to mention everything in the cabin is pristine, crafted beautifully and enjoyable to spend time in.
April was the epitome of a great host! Definitely going back."

The tiny kitchen is well-equipped with everything needed to prepare simple meals. Privacy is afforded by the way the cabin is positioned, even though it is on the owners' property. Easy to be outside at the grill or fire ring or on the deck while being out-of-sight. Roomy fishing dock is only steps away, with all you need to fish or kayak. It is a very quiet & peaceful country setting. There is also a walking trail on-site & worth the time. April & Brian are excellent hosts, friendly & responsive. Highly recommend this unique site!"

April and Brian's house is close enough that they could help if we had needed anything, but far enough away that the cabin was very private. The cabin itself was absolutely perfect. Everything was extremely clean, and the rustic decor was delightful. It felt so cozy. The cabin had everything you could need and then some. The pond was so fun. We fed the turtles and fish and then in the morning, we went fishing and caught catfish and another smaller type of fish. We chose this cabin to celebrate our fifth wedding anniversary, and it did not disappoint! Thanks to April for the recommendation of Seasoning Bistro for our anniversary dinner. It is located in Benton, only about fifteen minutes away. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was delightful. We would definitely recommend this place, and hope we are able to come back!"

I enjoyed fishing in the catch & release pond, walking through the trails on their property, visiting Rend lake not too far away, and making smores by the outdoor fireplace. When I arrived, the cabin was very clean, the linens smelled good and the bed was comfortable. It's a nice little cabin for a weekend getaway from the city. Their small cabin doesn't feel cramped, and the kitchenette and full bathroom fit perfectly. There is an on-demand hot water heater that works well. It even has good wifi if you find yourself needing to do some work. They provided a few snacks and drinks in the mini-fridge.
I got to meet April & Brian when I arrived- they were very friendly and made me feel very welcomed. It was easy to communicate with them and they made sure I had everything I needed. I felt very rested after my trip. This was probably my favorite Airbnb stay so far. I hope I can go back & visit!"

It’s in good proximity to Rend Lake if you’re looking to take advantage of the area. The small cabin and setting were well-described in April’s listing and photos true. It was spotlessly cleaned with thoughtful touches from April like snacks, water/soda, an assortment of flavored coffee creamer and even a few toiletries if you’ve forgotten something. The bed was extremely comfortable for a good night’s sleep. We enjoyed walking the trails winding throughout the property which Brian maintains. We spent our evenings on the dock and had fun feeding the catfish. We have AT&T cell service and had no issues with wireless and I was able to send and receive texts inside by stepping to the front of the cabin. April and Brian will respect your privacy if you wish for seclusion but we were happy to to meet them. They are conscientious and the nicest people. You can’t go wrong with the Lilypad Cabin!"

Stayed with a pet","My family of eight were looking for a place to stay near my family and near Rend Lake. We found this place on Airbnb and found it to be nice and affordable. When we pulled up, we loved that it was on a dead end street. It was super peaceful outside. There was patio furniture and a basketball hoop set up outside. Check-in was very easy and super intuitive. When we entered the home, we were so impressed with the space. The home is very nice outside, but gorgeous inside and has plenty of room for our large family. The living room has a huge sectional that is so comfortable and a large flatscreen prepared. There were kids toys that my children were occupied with as we unpacked. The jetted tub in the bathroom was a nice touch. The kitchen was prepared with everything we needed to make dinner and have coffee in the morning. Overall, I would highly recommend this Airbnb. Kristofer was very kind and accommodating. We will recommend to friends and family. Thank you!!"

The house had lots of historic pictures and was furnished with many neat things. Fantastic game room with a pool table. The main bedroom and bathrooms are very nice and roomy and on each end of the house, so if you shared the house with another couple, it would be private sleeping areas. Mt Vernon had their fall festival on and it was walking distance to downtown. St Louis is only an hour away. The trains were not an issue for us. We would definitely stay again."

Stayed a few nights","We really loved the house a lot and had a wonderful stay. We appreciated the off-street parking and entry to the house was smooth. The space in there is great, it felt secure, the neighborhood was quiet for the most part, and there are some other gorgeous old houses in the neighborhood, too, that were fun to see. Bottled water, chips, pint of ice cream, and lotion/hair care products were a nice touch along with a handwritten welcome note when we arrived. The retro look and feel of the place was very charming! All the photos and pictures on the walls were SO interesting and the lighting was cozy and warm. We played pool and also chess and checkers. :) Bathrooms were great, beds were comfortable, pillows were just right, and sheets were nice and soft. Trains weren't loud enough to bother us. Nothing to sit on in the back room/porch area or outside, though, so anyone wanting to rent this in fair weather might want to bring some lawn chairs with them because there are some great spaces inside and out for enjoying the weather. I wanted to pack up the whole house, bring it home with me, and live in it! lol I would love to know who the original owners were and what they did for a living because that place would've been pretty upscale back when it was built. Wonderful, well-thought-out floor plan and solid, quality construction. Thank you for opening up this beautiful home and for a great AirBnB experience, Ryan!"

Stayed one night","If your planning on staying here, let me be honest, you get what you booked. 3 rooms, 2 bathrooms, and a extremely spacious house. But if I’m being completely honest the price is not worth it. Compared to the other places we’ve stayed it is quite expensive. One of our bathrooms showers wouldn’t drain, and there was a little confusion in the checking out process, but other than that the place was okay. The check in process went smooth, but we thought they could have provided a few more essentials, soap, larger bath towels, etc. considering the price."

Super thankful we could take our dogs with, they enjoyed roaming around the house a little. Honestly the tiny house is so tiny it wasn’t very practical having a German Shepard taking up so much room!!
Looking forward to booking again and spending more time on Rend Lake!"

Stayed a few nights","This stay is certainly cozy, and I have very few negative things to say about it! The hosts were very proactive in responding to my needs and concerns while I was at the stay. It’s a cozy, modern cabin !
There is, however, an elephant in the room that certainly tainted my stay. Apparently, the shower drain was not installed with a trap. This meant that for the first two days of my stay, sewer gases were free to enter the Airbnb. As the listing suggests, this is a tiny home, which meant that the gases were able to quickly accumulate. I left for work in the morning, and upon my return, was hit with a much-less-than-refreshing odor in the space. This oversight is not only a health hazard, it’s against IL plumbing code and it’s just downright unpleasant.
That being said, the hosts truly turned the situation around. They were very apologetic, & had a plumber on site just a few hours after I reported the smell. They went above and beyond following the incident, offering a night free. Nice!"

Stayed one night","Justin and Crystal have performed an act of design magic by placing a full menu of conveniences in a tiny home’s small footprint. The interior layout is efficient without any element of crowding. Indeed, their space reminds me of the Black family’s residence in Harry Potter where the building appears much smaller on the outside than the reality inside. As a carpenter, I found the natural finish of the tongue and groove walls completely enchanting.
In their pursuit of perfect hospitality, Justin and Crystal stocked the mini-fridge with bottled water and creamer pods while a snack basket offers with an assortment of treats to entertain many palettes.
Singles and couples should consider a stay especially if a visit to nearby Rend Lake is in their itinerary. Light sleepers should note however that traffic noise increases in the morning and a nearby rail line features the rumbling of periodic freight trains."

Stayed with kids","Rented this place because it was big and had great reviews. Was not small child friendly. The place was really dirty, could see where you walked on the dirt on the floor. My child was covered in dirt from just playing in the living room. A lot of bugs, not bugs like roaches, just regular bugs that you’d like to keep outside and not in your bedroom. Hairs left behind in the showers and tubs. Cleaning supplies and mouse traps left in places my toddler could and did easily get too. On top of this it was 87 and the a/c could not cool the house until around 10 at night. Would never rent this place again"

Stayed one night",We stayed one night after a long day of driving. We had plenty of space to spread out and everyone had their own beds. Some are definitely meant for younger children (bunk beds) vs adults but since we only had four adults it worked out fine. Just a heads up if your group is all adults. Martha is proactive with communicating. There is a great area for kids to play in the basement which would be great if traveling with young kids. Fully stocked kitchen for those wanting to prepare meals there.

Stayed with a pet","If you're looking for a cutesy/high quality place to vacation, this is not what you're looking for. The house seemed lived in(wet/used towels still hanging up in the bathroom. Fridge/freezer stocked with open food items-not just condiments). The basement is still under construction. Most of the outlets in the basement bedroom didn't work. Cleanliness seemed to focus only on the kitchen and toilet (minor mold found in two areas).
However, if you are simply looking for a place to sleep with enough space for the whole family (including pets), this place is ideal!
I think the price tag reflects a cutesy/high quality vacation, not a large space to sleep. With that in mind, I'd say it's overpriced."

It is a rural area, but town center was 10 minutes away. She even took care to have the porch and walkways shoveled after a snow storm. She has WiFi and good beds. The big chair in front of the fire place is the best place for a good book and a nap. :)"

Stayed with kids","Rosemary’s house was the perfect place for a meeting of family. My niece, her young children and my two nephews had a wonderful time. The children played their hearts out inside and outside without electronic distractions. The home is beautifully decorated, has so much room, the furniture is tasteful and comfortable. We lacked for nothing. I would recommend this home to anyone. I hope we can meet there again for a longer period next year."

Group trip","Home was large which is why we booked it to use for family during my daughter's wedding. All in all, we had a good stay. Due to the heat the first day, my daughter had to get a hotel room to make sure that she was cool enough to sleep for the remaining days in Mount Vernon.
Pros: Large space with plenty of room, comfortable beds, nice amenities and extras, reliable wi-fi, easy to get to/convenient location for us. Decorated cute. Nice new back patio and grill. Rosemary was a wonderful hostess and communicated well before and during our stay.
Cons: Cooling could not keep up during hot/humid stay. Cooled down overnight, but during the 100 degree days it was 75-78 although stat was set to 68. No TVs :( Traffic noise from the highway was loud starting at 5:30am, so bring a sleep machine or fan.
Rosemary responded quickly when we told her that the home would not cool down after we arrived. She arranged for an HVAC guy to service the unit on the second morning. Very responsive!"

Group trip","The house was clean and decorated nicely. The kitchen is stocked with coffee, condiments, and everything you would need to cook with. There are plenty of towels in the bathrooms however the hot water was an issue, only 1 person was able to shower the morning we were leaving, and 2 hours after they showered we still did not have hot water. I did make her aware after we checked out, there was nothing really that could have been done that morning. Hopefully, they will fix that problem. An oddity to me was there are absolutely no TVs in this residence. Not something I would have even thought to look at on amenities, I have never been in a house with no tv. If you are only planning to sleep there is no big deal, but I had 5 people waiting there for a wedding all day with not a lot to do. Also, be mindful that if you are traveling with pets, they are welcome as stated in her ad but there is an additional fee. I did not see that mentioned in the ad and I missed it when booking."

Stayed one night","We stopped for one night on a road trip and this house was perfect for that purpose. This was so much better for our family of four (with two large teens) than a hotel.
Rosemary was very communicative the day of our trip. As noted on the listing, they are working on the landscaping. That wasn’t an issue for us. The home is much more spacious than it appears. Plenty of room for a large group. Kitchen was well stocked. It’s on a main road but the street wasn’t very busy and traffic died down around bedtime. We slept well."

Stayed with a pet",We had a quick overnight here on our way to see our son in Georgia. This was a wonderful house to stop at with my extended family and relax for a bit after a long day on the road! Plenty of space for everyone to have their own comfortable bed! And even a few nice surprises left in the fridge and cupboards for us! We would definitely recommend this house and would have enjoyed it for a longer stay as well.

Group trip","Rosemary’s place was perfect for our group of 8. The home was clean and cozy, beds were comfy, and the open kitchen-living room floor plan offered plenty of space for our group to hang out. The kitchen was thoughtfully stocked with everything we needed for making breakfast at home, including coffee and eggs and bacon in the fridge! Rosemary was quick to respond to any questions, and was upfront about the ongoing work they’re doing in the backyard, leaving that space unavailable for use at the moment. Everyone in our group agreed that we would absolutely stay here again!"
