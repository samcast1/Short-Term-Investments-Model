Stayed with kids","10 ⭐️!! Jeff’s place was SO clean (a huge plus for me), beds were comfortable & you literally feel right at home. This house is laid out perfectly to where everyone has their own space to stretch out or get ready. Our family couldn’t stop complimenting the 70’s charm this space holds. We were in town for basketball tournaments & couldn’t ask for a more convenient place to stay. 15 minutes to Tullahoma one way & 8 minutes the other for Shelbyville. The communication & hospitality was great & Jeff even let us know in advance that the house would be good for early check-in if we desired! There was a cute little breakfast/lunch spot right below the house, & also an icecream shop that we walked to with the kids one afternoon! If we’re ever in town again, we will be staying here again. I can’t think of one complaint! I will also be checking out his other listings for future possible travels. 😊 Thank you Jeff!!"

All of the beds were comfortable and we had everything that we could have possibly needed and more! We were in town for an AAU tournament in Shelbyville and were able to rest before and in between games so that our girls felt wonderful. I was amazed at how clean this house was and even felt a little sad to go back to my own home. LOL! We will definitely be back if ever need a place to stay in this area.

Stayed a few nights","Jeff's home was nice. Very clean and orderly. One of the few short-term rental homes available in the town of Shelbyville.
The neighborhood was quiet. Mid-century modern architecture. The house had a very homey feel it was more like a rustic cabin.
The house had a lot of history and interesting items which gave it character.
The beds were very comfortable and the utilities worked well. The cable and Wi-Fi was satisfactory, which was a plus because Shelbyville has limited access to cell signals and internet sources.
The home had all of the necessary utilities fridge, washer / dryer, and multiple televisions.
Jeff lives next door and was responsive and attentive. All in all the stay went quite well."

The house is neat, clean and well stocked.
It is somewhat a step back in time to the 70's, but in a nice way.
The beds are comfortable and the yard is spectacular.
The screened in back porch/game room came in very handy since it rained a lot while we were there.
When we are next in the area, we will first seek out Jeff and this home."

Group trip","The Sycamore House is located in a very quiet neighborhood. We enjoy taking walks - and the surrounding roads were quiet and flat. The house is also located very close to the amenities of Shelbyville - restaurants, groceries, shopping, Walmart, and the Celebration Walking Horse facilities. It is about 30 minutes to Murfreesboro, and another 30 minutes to Nashville. The house has 2 large common rooms, a dining room, and a kitchen (with a peninsula and 4 high top chairs) in the center of the house. Toward the back is a large sunroom, complete with a fireplace and an attached bathroom with sink/toilet/shower stall. To the left side of the house is the garage (we did not use it) and 2 bedrooms - sharing a bathroom that had a double sink, a tub/shower AND a separate shower stall. To the right side of the house is the master bedroom with a changing area - including a sink and counter space; a separate sink/toilet/tub-shower; and also a large closet. The house is very well maintained, with a rustic retro-70s look and feel. Appliances are older - but worked just fine. The wifi worked great, and the 2 TVs had Roku (which we found challenging at first, but we figured it out!)... During our visit, both the heat and the air conditioning worked fine. We would highly recommend the Sycamore House - and would stay there again!"

A nice large basket filled with snacks and goodies were left there for me and very much appreciated. Also, coffee is provided and two ice cold bottled waters in the fridge. The setting is beautiful out in the country. I enjoyed hearing the birds singing, owls hooting, and cows mooing! Such a nice respite from the city. I wasn’t sure I had done the lock right, so Travis came over to check the door and make sure I was locked in for the night. I really appreciated that."

The house is very well laid out and every space is used to it’s maximum potential. They provided snacks, coffee and water for our convenience. Every time we turned around there was something else we noticed they thought about to make our stay more enjoyable.
The tiny house was decorated so lovely. Very much in style and so cozy and inspiring. It was just beautiful.
This was our first stay at an air B&B and it was a wonderful experience."

They included a basket of treats: oatmeal for breakfast plus snack packs, popcorn and beverage selection. It was a very comfortable and quiet country setting yet close to restaurants and local attractions. We would definitely recommend a stay."

The kitchenette was gorgeous with an amazing coffee maker that was a pleasure to use when we woke up the next morning. Travis and Lindsey had a basket stocked with snacks, oatmeal and coffee which was highly appreciated and made our stay so much more enjoyable. The mini fridge had a few waters and a selection of fizzy drinks to enjoy! The bathroom was so cozy and the shower was so refreshing and relaxing to clean up in. I have got to say, the bed that is in this tiny house is possibly the most comfortable bed my fiancé and I have ever slept in! Not to mention that the sheets and blankets were so adorable and smelled amazing. There is also a window unit that worked perfectly, and I was so grateful for that since I get hot at night. All in all, this was a 5 star stay and we loved it. I would recommend this to anyone."

The space was fine for two people, exceptionally clean, and they included additional amenities which were not listed. When we arrived we met Lindsey outside and she was very friendly and helpful, and made herself available for anything we may need, but the home was well stocked and we needed nothing. Check-in and check-out were both very easy. We attend an annual family reunion every summer in Shelbyville and intend to reserve the home again, assuming it is available."

My teenage daughter had a volleyball tournament for the weekend and this place was perfect! The price was a spectacular deal. I paid less for this house than I would have for the hotel with two queen beds. All of the information I needed was sent to me prior to the date of our reservation. Check-in was super simple. Every detail was outlined on how to get in and out of the house, what the expectations were for staying there, and how to check out. The place is much bigger than it looks on the Internet. It is a quaint beautiful place and very well kept! Even the neighbors were super friendly!
I highly recommend this beautiful place if you are heading to Wartrace.

There were small details that 99% of other Airbnbs wouldn’t think to include. We loved the little riddles to find toys and the little things hidden around the house for the kids to find. Everyone felt right at home and the historic house was spotless and redone incredibly. Such a beautiful area and peaceful little town and we wish we could’ve stayed longer than one night! Will definitely be back if we are ever in the area and will recommend to anyone who might be traveling to or near Wartrace. Thank you for a wonderful stay!"

The house was very well furnished. The beds were super comfortable and everyone slept great. The kitchen was well stocked and we had everything we needed including a Keurig and regular coffee pot, coffee, creamer, sugar, and spices! The game room is full of fun games to play with young and old alike including a pool table. We spent the day visiting downtown Wartrace and Bell Buckle. Ate lunch at Chabbi's Sweet's and Eats and it was delicious. Chris was very responsive to any questions I had. It was bitterly cold and would have loved to have gotten to spend a little time hanging out on the front porch or at the fire pit. We will definitely be staying here again sometime."

Stayed over a week","This was my second, multi-week stay at Leonard’s over the past year. I came back because the accommodations, pricing and overall customer service is outstanding. The location is in a quiet neighborhood relatively close to downtown. My own private space was in a loft above a detached garage. I had all the comforts of home and found that Leonard struck a great balance of allowing me space to come and go while also making himself available for any questions or respond to feedback I might have. I’ll come back to Shelbyville a couple more times for my project and hope to stay here for those trips too."

Stayed a few nights","First note that I only review with all honesty, nothing inflated. That said, I was more than happy with Leonard's place. It was all that was stated to be, and more.
When I pulled up late, weary after hours on the road, the lights were on and it was super easy to unload and relax. The space was very welcoming and spotlessly clean-yay! This is not always the case and one can never really know what to expect when staying somewhere new (I do always read reviews). But I was pleasantly surprised to find that my expectations were exceeded!
This may be described within the listing as ""no frills"", but that's not actually true. I feel that when a space is extra clean, extra cozy, extra comfortable and *quiet*, that sends it over the top; Leonard's place really did that for me, and I was super happy to have landed there.
An additional note; it is never easy for me to just relax, settle in, and get a good night's sleep; but I slept like a baby! I will certainly be returning!"

We were greeted by their incredibly friendly and welcoming pups, but not before driving through grazing and lounging Alpacas. This apartment is within 15/20 minutes of the Jack Daniel and Nearest Green distilleries (which I recommend), but far enough out that you get the country and woodsy feel. 10/10 would stay again."

Stayed one night","I'd give this one six stars if I could. One of the best AirBnB experiences I've ever had. Clean, spacious, private, and comfortable living space--essentially a fully finished mother-in-law suite above the host's semi-detached carriage house. It shares a portico with the main residence but no walls, so you don't have to worry about noise or being too loud. Great bed, lots of extra pillows and blankets if you need them; excellent bathroom, luxury towels, and, best of all, your own tankless water heater. Every amenity you could want. And alpacas! We loved getting up in the morning and taking a walk down to the stream to see the alpacas. So cute. Will absolutely be booking this place again if I'm in this part of Tennessee again. Lovely."

It was fun to see the animals. The landscape was beautiful with a stream running in front of the property. It was gated, and we felt extremely safe. It was close to Jack Daniels Distillery and loved the towns that were close, Tullahoma and Bell Buckle. We also loved visiting Rutledge Waterfall. It was awesome. It was a relaxing stay. We would definitely recommend this place to anyone. The only thing that could be a problem for someone who can't climb stairs was it is over a garage. But, it was not a problem for us. We thank Robbie for the great place.

My stay only brought me here for one night, but it was the best sleep I have had in probably 20 years...not sure if it was the bed or the quiet, probably both! I cannot forget to mention this; the sheets and towels smelled so incredibly clean and fresh!
In the evening, Shannon took me with to feed the Alpacas and patiently answered the million questions I had about raising Alpacas. Thanks Shannon! I would highly recommend staying here. I even say, go out of your way - its worth it! I also will say that I really appreciate no cleaning fees. I hope everyone respects their home and they can continue to provide that perk! Thank you again!

This farm was so beautiful! From the loft we stayed in to the property and ofcourse the animals. Although there are alpacas everywhere, there is not manure all over and no smells of animals (we wouldnt care either way but this may be a concern for others). We loved being greeted by Murphy the dog every morning! We checked out Rutledge Falls which is about a 20 minute drive and it was breath taking! We swam in the water right under the falls. Robbie and his family were so welcoming and kind. The drive way is very steep but is nicely paved. The water pressure was wonderful, bed was comfortable and we had everything we needed. We wish we could have stayed longer and definitely will be back! What a neat experience for anyone"

They are the epitome of southern hospitality! You feel as if you are at your home away from home! The surroundings are beyond beautiful, and their cooking is so delicious!! The food comes from their garden and is wholesome and full of flavor! My children and I went horseback riding across the 44 acres and took in the majestic views. You can help Jerry collect the chickens’ eggs and feed the horses (which we did)! We also enjoyed a fire pit on the very cold nights, and were treated to s’mores along with great conversation! We brought along our dogs, who had a blast being off the leash the entire time! The guest house has every amenity you could need, and was furnished beautifully with farmhouse decor! Blythe and Jerry are the sweetest people you will ever meet and make your stay an absolute slice of heaven!!"

We were able to pick and eat straight from gardens. Our children loved the pool, horses and chickens. We already booked a return!"

The house itself was thoughtfully equipped, providing ample entertainment options for our family, including air hockey, a pool table, and a relaxing hot tub. The layout, though unique, proved to be quite functional, with a master bathroom on one side and two additional bedrooms on the opposite end of the house. Without a doubt, we'll be returning for future visits. Highly recommended!"

Was even able to get us checked in a few hours early. I will definitely be coming back to home in the near future!

Can't say enough about how comfortable the beds were. The host was absolutely amazing. The hot tub with the fire pit on the back porch was just absolutely perfect. This will be our go to Destination every time we come to the Shelbyville area to visit family. Absolute 5 stars

Stayed with kids","Russ was an amazing host. He was extremely responsive, nice, and knowledgeable. The house was in great condition. It has a very private covered back patio area with a jacuzzi that was used by our littles a ton. He even had someone come make sure that all of the chemicals were balanced before use. The sleeping accommodations were perfect, as they were all memory foam beds that slept great. The game room was awesome for watching football and relaxing while playing a game of pool or some air hockey. I'd say all in all probably the most enjoyable stay away from home that I have ever had. Great Host, Great House, Great for families. I will absolutely be booking this house for my family when they come into town."

Stayed one night","What a great place to stay! I was in town visiting family, and this place was a great getaway. My family lives in Shelbyville, but this was like having a vacation for the entire family, even though we were only 10 minutes away!
The layout of the house pulls you toward the fun areas, so it was easy to enjoy the different spaces.
The kitchen was well stocked with utensils and everything was clean. We appreciated that there was coffee stocked as well!
The hot tub had clear instructions, and my nephew had a blast after we pullled him in!
The game room was definitely our favorite spot. The air hockey table was great for the littles, and we played pool for hours.
Would definitely recommend."

Gina was so prompt with her responses and even offered to take the time to turn the heat on for us as she knew we were going to be getting there later in the evening. They gave us a wonderful tour around their property in the morning and let us get to spend some time around their three beautiful horses.

First of all the drive in is GORGEOUS! Lewisburg looks to be a very equestrian are so the whole way there you're really seeing some of the most beautiful homes and horses; its just a dream if yiu love horses.
The apartment itself was so beautiful 😍 and something super fun is the windows that look into the horse barn from inside the apartment. The fact that everything runs on well water was so amazing. My hair and skin were SO GRATEFUL for how soft the water was in the shower. As well as I'm just a country girl who appreciates well water.
Mr. Gina and her Husband were just very pleasant and acomidating people and my stay was so comfortable and relaxing its definitely on the top of my list for places I wouod love to return to just for the fun of staying there. 😊"

Stayed with a pet","Gina and her husband were very easy to get ahold of and very pleasant to speak with. The unit is as described and pictured, clean, and has all the necessities. I had incorrectly assumed that there was a bunch of units just based on the size of the front of the barn, but the rest of the barn is just that- a barn- so I saw no one other than the hosts (and only saw them in passing) so it was a very peaceful stay. There is a Dollar General maybe a mile from the property, and a gas station a bit beyond that, so there are the basics close by, and everything else is an easy 8 minute drive away. If you are in search of an easy, safe, and friendly spot, this will perfectly suit your needs. Thank you Gina and Randall!"

The cozy farm-life atmosphere was a fantastic spot to stay during my 12-weeks. I already miss it! Lori is so gracious and genuine and undoubtedly, the hostess with the mostess! She always goes above and beyond with her attention to detail as well as thoughtful amenities to make the stay exceptional. Lori is a woman of many talents with incredible cooking skills, amazing on-site yoga classes, and has immense knowledge of the surrounding area with recommendations on fantastic local spots. It is evident that they genuinely cared about my comfort and well-being during my stay. I would most definitely recommend this place for a quiet and peaceful place to relax with great hospitality.

The hosts were very hospitable, accommodating and overall wonderful people. Lori is a great yoga instructor offering classes downstairs in her yoga studio. I took full advantage of that! Peloton was a terrific addition as I got to sample what it had to offer. The internet speeds were fantastic with no interruptions - perfect for a remote worker like myself. Download speed was up to 80 Mbps and upload between 10 and 15 Mbps. The place is definitely small, but I was able to make full meals in the kitchenette. The water pressure in the shower was by far the best I have experienced and I miss it already :)
Last, but not least, the sunrises are the best I have ever seen. Book their place just for that!"

The space (studio size) is cozy, perfect for the solo traveler or someone who is relocating to a new state (like myself). It has all the amenities you could ask for, including a nice kitchenette, mini bookshelves, and smart TV! The view here is also quite breathtaking. You’ll be able to witness the most gorgeous sunrises and dazzling stars right outside the front door. :)
Lori and Bill are some of the sweetest hosts I have ever met. They exude warmth and hospitality. I’ve enjoyed getting to know them (their fur babies too!) and being invited to family dinners, community gatherings and more. I’ve also been given eggs right off the farm…what a treat!
If you’re looking for a taste of life in the country, look no further. You’ll love it here. The environment, the space, and your gracious hosts. Great overall value.
Thank you, Lori and Bill, for everything. You are a blessing!"

The location is lovely and restful with a beautiful view. This was easily the best air bnb visit I have ever had, and I have stayed in many. The amenities are extremely convenient, she had thought of everything! The bed is comfortable and the temperature of the studio was adjustable based on preference. highly recommend."

They went above and beyond what any host has ever done for me. They are genuinely kind human beings. I worked from home and the internet was spectacular. They views you will get from the bunker are breath taking. you will wake up to a beautiful sunrise in your front door and a breathe taking sunset just about every evening towards the back of the bunker. I have two fur babies that are my life and they fit right in with her little ones and even Bruno the horse. If you are an animal lover, this is the place to be. If you want to be treated like family..this is your spot. Thanks Guys."

Stayed about a week","This was the best airbnb stay we have ever had! The space was adorable with plenty of storage space. Lori was so accommodating. She brought us over a pet hair vacuum, an electric water boiler, coffee pods, water bottles, the whole 9 yards. Lori and her husband Billy had us over for burgers one night. The burgers were delicious and they are simply fantastic company. We probably overstayed our welcome chit-chatting into the night. Billy invited us stargazing in the backyard one night. He is very knowledgeable about the cosmos and it was such a fun night. Lori's 3 dogs were very friendly and welcoming to our pup. Our 1 year old pup and her 1 year old pup played hard for hours everyday in their fenced-in yard. The bed had a super comfortable mattress topper on it. We slept so well! They had some restaurant and local park/hiking suggestions for us, which was very helpful. The sunrises were stunning and I really enjoyed watching her horse and her neighbors horses out grazing in the field. She has chickens too and they are soooo cute! Sadly my pup went after one of them. Luckily, the chicken was okay. I was careful not to let him out of my reach after that. We truly could not have had a better time staying at Lori's. You'll love it here."

Lori and her husband went out of their way to make sure I was happy with everything. They also offered many suggestions for places to visit in town and answered any of my question.

Its also well stocked with coffee and tea and the things that go with it, what a bonus! Everything was just starting to bloom while we were there so it doesnt look quite like the photos as i believe those were taken in the summer but it is still an adorable place, very quaint! Just the right kind of space for 2 people to be comfortable. I highly recommend the Hilltop Bed & Breakfast Cottage for your stay in Shelbyville.

outside, the seating was filthy. we are outdoors people and used to sitting out. I cleaned the rocker so my wife could sit out. the dinette (outside) was in the same condition.
all of the gardens are overgrown and weedy. we are gardeners. we understand the commitment it takes to maintain them and the exterior pictures were part of the reason we booked this property."

No other problems in the 8 weeks I was there. The driveway is lined with flowers and there is a charming sunroom at the rear. Walk in shower with great water pressure. Instant hot water.

Stayed with kids","The home is rustic, cozy, with a beautiful location. The kitchen had everything we could have thought of ever needing. The beds were amazingly comfortable and we loved the gas fireplaces, as well as access to the grill. Josh and Jenny were extremely responsive when the power went out; they got us back up and running quickly until the power came back. The piano turned out to be an unexpected addition for our grandson - he loved it! Thank you so much for everything!!"

Stayed with kids",We had a wonderfully relaxing stay. Justin and Lauren have done an amazing job at providing everything needed for a relaxing time away. Our kids loved the play area and all the area to run around. The porch swing was perfect to sit and relax after dinner. Comfortable beds are a must for us and we were not disappointed. We will definitely be back. Hosts are super responsive and left a nice list of local attractions. We also liked the fact that the check out list was super reasonable. Thank you!

Stayed a few nights","This house was a great place to stay. It was out in the country and was very relaxing. We enjoyed the firepit and the screened in porch. Our grandchildren enjoyed the swing set. Excellent choice for a place to stay near Shelbyville, Tullahoma and Lynchburg."

Stayed a few nights",Love this property! The house was newly renovated with super cool historic value added! The beds were very comfortable and rooms very spacious. We spent a short weekend here with our two kids; went boating on Tim’s Ford lake which was just under 30mins drive. Great restaurant on the marina too. The home’s patio has a grill and a cool fire-pit which we used both nights - just remember to bring your own firewood or the gas station 5mins down the road sells some. My kids loved all the warm and clean blankets provided on the property. We will be back soon!

Stayed a few nights","Melissa’s home is comfortable, cozy, and very clean. The home was very quiet. The location is outside of town but close enough that Door Dash still delivers.
I would stay again if I was in the area.
Although, I didn’t meet Melissa she is fast to answer questions and has a helpful pamphlet full of information about things in the home.
Check in and out was simple and fast.
Thanks again Melissa."
