Stayed a few nights","The HotHouse and SweatShop were an amazing combination for my weekend stay with my newly wed wife and I. The first thing that caught our eye when we entered the house was the amazing card, champagne and chocolates from the host! The house was everything and more. We explored and used every amenity to include the hot tub, jacuzzi tub in the house and the SweatShop had everything we desired and so much more. This weekend allowed us to not only unwind and enjoy our mini honeymoon, but also allowed us to explore and do things we only dreamed of. We are ready to plan our second trip back to this amazing combo place in the middle of nowhere! Thank you for a wonderful weekend stay at your place and highly recommend this to all looking to get away and enjoy trying things outside the norm and trying what your wildest dreams and desires want and need! Lance and Jackie!"

Stayed a few nights","I have no words to describe our experience at Juliana and Mike’s place. My wife and I are in shock at how much fun we had spending our first wedding anniversary here. We are also equally depressed that we have to go back to reality when spending two days in sexy PARADISE. The place was SPOTLESS, everything was labeled clearly for our use, the bed was amazingly comfortable, the hot tub was steamy in more ways than one 😍😍 And don’t get us started on the sweatshop… Had us seeing stars as we left that place each night!!! You CANNOT come here without renting The Sweatshop!!!!! We had trouble deciding where to spend time, we just kept going back and forth. They also were amazing and left us some champagne and chocolates for our anniversary! They had basic condiments and seasonings as well if you are too busy to leave the house for food 😋 We are already making plans to come back. 10/10 experience!!! Thank you guys soooo much!"

Stayed a few nights","My advice… BOOK NOW!!! This place was an absolute dream! A romantic wonderland! My husband and I traveled here specifically for this place and it exceeded expectations! The Hot House was so incredibly inviting and relaxing. Plenty of space to enjoy each other! The property is extremely private so we felt comfortable no matter where we spent our time. Juliana was incredibly amazing! She always responded to our questions within an hour and was extremely helpful and friendly. The Hot House was amazing on its own but without spoiling any surprises, The SWEATSHOP was the icing on the cake! We were here all week and were so sad to leave! We have had so many people asking for the information to book and we’ll recommend this property every single time! Already planning to come back at least once a year! It’s just that good and I promise there’s no place else that is like this or better than this! Our only complain is that we didn’t book to stay longer! Don’t walk, RUN to book this place!!! ❤️"

The amount of thought that went into EVERY aspect of this place was Super Impressive to say the least. Very Clean and organized. Questions and request were answered quickly. The Entire Experience was a Home Run. Bravo Juliana and Mike. We will be back often.

I adored the bathtub 😍 the hot tub was peaceful and you could even see the TV from it so that was nice. An unexpected but nice bonus was the espresso maker. Being able to make good coffee was definitely a huge bonus

Stayed one night","My partner and I absolutely loved staying at Juliana and Michael’s place. I booked for a post - valentine’s day surprise and we were blown away. It was the only house in sight, with woods and trees surrounding - made for a very private and peaceful location! ;)
The place was squeaky clean & had so many, fun surprises scattered around. The bed was the most comfortable bed i’ve ever slept in.
Make sure to utilize the mounts scattered around!! We had so much fun making movies! The attention to detail is simply perfect and we were in awe with the ambiance of the place.
DO NOT MISS OUT ON THE SWEATSHOP!! This was an incredibly surreal experience. We loved being able to act on our fantasies and try new things we wouldn’t be able to try otherwise. It is 110% worth it!
Overall, our favorite parts were talking by the fire pit, relaxing in the pool with some drinking games & music, and ending the night with a fun soak in the tub. We can’t wait to return soon! <3"

Stayed one night","My wife and I decided to have a little getaway for Valentine’s Day - away from the kids, work, etc. We have been together 15 years, married 6, and have always been a bit spicy but wanted to take it to the next level. This place was IT… Between the hot tub, pole, tub for two, and comfortable bed at the Hothouse to the absolutely mind blowing Sweatshop… we had a blast. We tried every single thing offered between the two places and spent HOURS with each other. Love and passion was absolutely rediscovered here and we left feeling even more connected to each other. Juliana thought of everything - from the decor of both places, to the amenities, to the little details like lots and lots of towels, placement of things, etc. If you’re looking for something new, or a place to test out desires, that is it. Highly recommend the space and the host! We WILL be back!"

The house was absolutely beautiful and the sweatshop had tons of different things to try out. I mentioned when booking it was a mini getaway for his birthday and they even left a birthday card and chocolates for him 😊 We’ll definitely be returning!

The house is clean with lots of surprises to find all around. There is a nice area outside to hang out even though it was too cold out this time for that so we just kept going between the two spaces.
We cannot wait to go back!"

We went there to celebrate our anniversary and we love everything about this place. They had champagne and chocolates waiting for us and rose petals everywhere when we arrived. We were there for three nights and we didn't have to go out anywhere. From the hot tub to the big screen TV, the grill, and the coffee!! They help us with everything we need and even give us tips on how to use some of the amenities of the place. Everything was clean, the kitchen was fully prepared for our cooking needs. The sweatshop is amazing. Super clean and with everything you need to have fun with your partner. We can't wait to go back. Also, the location is so beautiful and peaceful!

Everything was as described but we were in awe of how much thought went into the decor, we kept finding little things we hadn't seen at first glance and loved the attention to detail. It felt like our own little slice of heaven. The Sweat Shop had everything we could have asked for and more! It was so much fun to get to spend quality time with my wife and just enjoy all of each other in absolutely solitude and no distractions. We will be booking here again in the future."

I would 100% recommend to also rent the sweat shop. It is literally 2 feet from the house and super private. The host came and showed us around and explained everything to us, it was super fun to explore all of that in our own privacy, as we have never been in an adults only space like that and it was worth every dollar.
Both owners were fantastic at communication and extremely responsive. We will definitely be back! Thank you for hosting us!"

Juliana is great with responding if you do have any questions or concerns! My partner and I had a WONDERFUL stay. We didn’t leave the property once we arrived and still didn’t get to enjoy everything we wanted to do while we were there since there is so much to enjoy. From soaking in the jacuzzi, to lounging in the living/bedroom. The house is great and relaxing. Everything is clean and nice. The upkeep of everything is solid. Definitely do the add-on, very worth it! If you’re on the fence about staying here, do it! It is soooo worth it. My partner and I will for sure be back!!"

The host really thought of everything and made it so easy to use the house and everything it had to offer. The bathroom is incredible and there was tons of space and more than you can even get into in just one night. We will definitely be back!

Stayed a few nights","This place was great this has to be simply the best experience I’ve ever had in couples travel. Juliana is super friendly and don’t get me started on the dungeon. Ask her about the dungeon you won’t be disappointed! We had a blast folks kept asking us where it was we told no one lol wanted to keep this as our special place can’t wait to revisit this property. I had fun shooting some hoops, grilling, cooking, out doors all the land there it’s so quiet and peaceful no neighbors or noise my favorite was the hot tub out back and the golden throne to handle you business in the beautiful bathroom I also love the luxury of the patio set up and front porch over all 10 stars man you won’t be disappointed here. I tried to add additional two nights but it was already booked days ago I waited to late availability here is limited because it’s new but becoming high demand! It’s worth every penny she charged, it was a great time for a great couple of nights! Have fun be sure2leave her ur feedback."

Stayed one night","Juliana was a wonderful and responsive host! Tbh I was a little hesitant about booking this more pricey location, but it actually turned out to be a sparkling gem in the sea of mediocre, over-priced Airbnb’s and was worth every cent!. The way that Juliana turned such an unlikely place into a sexy and elegant playground for adults with just every detail imaginable blew my mind! The pics on the listing just cannot do justice for the amount of creativity and attention to detail Juliana brought to bring this fun filled attraction to life. One of my absolute fave features- there are two light switches in the house “party” and “neon”, flip the switch and hello! The place is transformed for the perfect party atmosphere. <3"

The place was squeaky clean, decorated nicely and the host was quick at responding when we had questions! The bed was so comfy(the pillows were AMAZING) and the robes provided were so plush and nice! I felt like a queen! The tub was so nice to relax and take a long hot bubble bath while watching a movie! The place is incredibly secluded and you will not worry about anyone watching while you enjoy the awesome hot tub! I’d 10/10 recommend this place to any couple I know looking to reconnect and enjoy your significant other and having some HOT fun😍"

The bathtub and shower are perfect for 2 and the robes and slippers were a really nice touch. I feel like it's the perfect place to get in touch with all things sexy and fulfill your fantasies, whatever they may be. We'll definitely be back!"

But… there is also a hot tub and a pole to dance on if you are feeling it. The coffee in the morning after a late night was perfect. 5 stars for sure."

Stayed about a week","Stayed at Bradley’s tiny home for a week. What a lovely tiny home this was. It is as pictured, I was amazed by the space utilization and how everything I needed was just at a arm’s reach. They even provided coffee pods which is rare at Airbnbs these days. They have so many storage space, I was surprised at how thoughtfully this space wasbuilt. I didnt even have to use all storage units. They even have a closet space.
All in all its lovely.
There isn’t much to do around the area. I was a bit worried about safety but the home is inside a gated property and felt completely safe, didnt have any issues at all. I drove back few times pretty late at night and felt completely safe. So if you feel the area seems sketchy while driving there, you wont have to worry about it.
The only issue I had was with the internet. It is pretty slow and was spotty every day. Had issues streaming movies and even when attending online meetings. Besides this everything else was great. Would stay again"

I have stayed in quite a few tiny houses and the set up inside has been one of my favorite. Like the comfortable living area to chill and read or watch TV and really appreciated the long counter space as well as storage in the back to hide the luggage clutter.
I will definitely be back if I need to visit Jax again."

The only issue I saw was the ladder to access the sleeping loft was pretty difficult, and I can see that being a problem for some guests depending on their physical ability, but thats is part of the tiny house experience. Otherwise the place was very night and well designed and Bradly was an awesome host with almost immediate responses to messages."

From the option of two different bathrooms and two different televisions toThe amazing interior of the house this was definitely an enjoyable stay for my wife and I. I even left with the key by accident and he was . understanding and polite and allowed me ample time to bring the key back instead of charging me. Definitely hope to stay again

Bradley was nice enough to give us a mini tour of all three, and it's quite the setup he's creating! Love the interconnected outdoor space, and if the koi pond actually comes together it'll really be something special.
He was very responsive and communicative throughout, and even accepted a groceries delivery for us (and packed it away) before we arrived without a problem. Not that I'm wanting to set overly high expectations for other guests.
Thanks a lot Bradley! If you're ever in Australia, hopefully we'll be able to host you in *our* tiny house one day."

It had everything we needed to prepare a full dinner, w/ a patio space that was great... especially with the access to the backyard space ( which itself is lovely).

Stayed with kids","Bradley’s tiny house is awesome! It’s very clean and very comfortable. We felt at home. You can tell a lot of time and effort was put into this tiny house. It’s creatively decorated and has an relaxing vibe. You feel like you are staying in a tiny beach house next to the ocean. My 6 year old son with sensory issues loved the moving blue lights on the porch. Out of our two week vacation he was the most relaxed staying in the tiny house, it made for a relaxing time for me. I only wish I had booked it for longer. My 8 year old who is gifted was fascinated with the construction and design of the tiny home. My son enjoyed looking at all of the treasures that tell a story. It was a great place to unplug.
I appreciated the camera and heavy duty locks on the door as I was traveling alone with my two sons. I felt very safe. Bradley greeted us shortly after we arrived. He was very prompt in response to any questions I had. He was very professional and down to earth. We enjoyed our time so much that my boys want to come back again next year. Our stay in Bradley’s home far exceeded my expectations!
Thank you!"

We left most of the lights off the whole time we were there to make a cave away from the harsh sunlight of Jacksonville. The neighborhood is pleasant and walkable and there are tons of nice restaurants and shops very close by.
We received several emails about getting in and amenities and anything I messaged got a response almost immediately. Very satisfied with the stay."

I booked it as a surprise for my wife and the atmosphere as you enter the room took her breath away. It really was surreal. Sights, sounds,, lighting, smelled amazing. Highly recommend and WILL be back if we’re in the area again. All airbnb hosts should aspire to be like this. True experience."

Stayed a few nights","Whimsical, Majestic,Peaceful!!! Those are the words to describe Nancy and Ron’s place. Not only was Nancy and Ron proactive and effectively responsive; they provided a sense of security. The modern day chic and harmonious decor made this place a home away from home and a environment to step away from life in. Everything looks as described in the pictures but seeing it in person gives you a feeling that’s closure to nature and peace. This made my stay in Jacksonville one to remember.
Moral of the story BOOK NOW, you will not regret it. I’ll be returning and thank you Nancy and Ron!!!"

My parents who are in their mid 60’s stayed in the main house and I stayed in this gem. It was great for us to be so close but have our privacy. The drive to the Mayo Clinic was about a twenty minute drive and staying in such a magical room was the peace and tranquility I needed for such a stressful time. I will definitely be back each time I need to visit!

Ethan was super responsive to our messages, even proactively reaching out and asking if there was anything he could do to improve our stay.

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I stayed at Ethan’s place while down from Ohio visiting our family in Jacksonville. Upon arrival we were pleasantly surprised by how clean the home was. I grew up in the area and I knew the houses were just built, but I expected to see at least a little sign of use and there was none. The house still had a smell like it was brand new. Ethan and his family went out of their way to make sure anyone staying there had all the things they could need incase anyone forgot something or incase they ran out and needed items they couldn’t find or didn’t want to have to spend money on. There’s also a guest book previous guests have signed stating where they were from, their favorite memories and giving recommendations of different places to visit while in town. You definitely get your moneys worth staying at Ethan’s place and next time we come down to Jacksonville if it’s available we will definitely be booking with him again."

Stayed a few nights","I truly enjoyed my two-night stay at Vicky and Marvin's place! They were so friendly and kind, I wished I had more time to spend with them. The room was comfortable and the bathroom was spotless. Communication was exceptional. The room is well-equipped with plenty of places to plug in devices, a great TV, and a little desk where I was able to work. Centrally located with lots of great restaurants within a few miles in either direction. I recommend Brewers Pizza and Ten Zushi. No matter where you decide to eat, you will enjoy your stay here!"

The place had just about every amenity that you could ever want and the hosts were extremely thoughtful with the room layout. The room couldn't have been cleaner, it was immaculate. The room was extremely comfortable, the bed was amazing, and the fan did an excellent job. There was plenty of lighting and it led to a very homey vibe.
On top of that, the wifi was excellent and plenty fast for any kind of work (I rely on wifi for work and it was great for me). There was also a desk which was actually useful and usable.
Overall, we had an amazing stay and we highly recommend you also stay here! We have been to many, many Airbnbs and this one is top-notch!"

It was a quiet stay and everything we needed and more. Vicky went above and beyond even before we checked in. We had arrived to the area a day early majority of hotels were booked or wanted $400 a night. Vicky helped me find one as soon as I messaged her. The extra things she puts out for you in the room is super sweet and a nice treat. Would absolutely book again!! Thanks again!!

Stayed about a week","Vicky and Marvin were probably the most hospitable hosts I have ever encountered. They really do want you to make yourself at home. I really appreciated being able to freely use what I needed, especially the washer and dryer. They both have such good spirits and the room is warm (in feel, not temperature) and comfortable. Everything was as pictured, clean and the decor inspired a sense of positivity. It is quiet and peaceful and they really made sure not to make noise when they thought I might be asleep. I also appreciate how understanding and flexible they are. I had some changes to my itinerary and they were very accommodating. Vicky asked how the temperature was to make sure that I was comfortable and said I could adjust it. That was thoughtful. They are very friendly and I enjoyed speaking with both of them. They also gave me my space and I knew when I was in the room that I would have my privacy and not be disturbed. I felt very comfortable keeping to myself to take care of what I needed and also welcome to interact. Everything is spelled out in the check-in instructions and Vicky is very communicative. Parking is convenient. I look forward to my return."

Stayed about a week","my husband and i had the pleasure of staying at casa de mi padre while i recovered from a specialized medical procedure. while our visit to jax wasn't a fun one, this airbnb's comfort (tricked out recliners!) and homey touches (makeup wipes by the bed!) provided some much needed ease and lightness. jc was the perfect host and proactively reached out to help us strategize post-surgery sleeping spots since it's a split level, which was really touching.
the only nit i can pick is that, since it's a newer building, noises from the neighborhood and nearby expressway were a touch loud. (and we're from chicago!) but we also came during what turned out to be bike week at daytona, so it's def not the airbnb's fault lol.
i can imagine this spot is perfect for families, or for anyone looking for a truly hospitable experience. i'll be thinking fondly of casa de mi padre!"

The home looked just like the pictures and was very clean and nicely decorated with lots of special touches. It was like home away from home. Kitchen was well equipped and bathrooms were stocked with pretty much everything you need. She truly has thought of most basic needs for a comfortable stay.

JC even left sparklers for the kids and 4 toothbrushes in the bathroom along with other items that not many hosts think of! Trust me you will not be disappointed! I wasn’t going to visit Florida next year as we do every year, but we are thinking of coming back just to stay here! You did your father proud JC! Amazing!"

JC does the extras that make you feel welcome and special (little welcome note, small gift items good for watching golf, small waters, etc). JC communicated well and proactively.

The interior design is a thing of beauty, with stunning woodwork and metalwork that showcase Jason's mastery of his craft. Attention to detail is evident in every corner of the space, right down to the carefully-painted frosted glass doors of the bathroom.
Located in a peaceful and quiet suburb just a few minutes outside the City of Jax, this unit is a great option for those looking for a serene getaway. Overall, I highly recommend the Captain's Quarter to anyone visiting the Jacksonville area."

Jason had no hesitation to welcome us so late and even offered a late check out if needed. The captains quarters was spotless, and no details overlooked. I love the Little touches of decorations and the kitchen being fully stocked. The bed was extremely comfortable. We loved walking in the neighborhood and to the coffee shop. Even though we only stayed one night, everything was so perfect! I highly recommend staying here and hope to return."

Stayed with a pet","The neighborhood is very walkable and our parking space was good. Unfortunately, we did not leave very high marks for Jason’s place and this is why: The photos make it look like this is a cozy place but we didn’t find it to be. The stairs are precarious and without tread on the steps it is dangerous. The photos don’t make it obvious that this is a garage with garage door tracks on the ceiling and they are low. My husband is 6’4 , he ducked his head a lot while downstairs. The shower doors are not secure and the shower as a whole wasn’t good, the water went hot and cold the entire shower time. I would say that the place was clean but the cheapest amenities were used i.e. coffee, toilet paper, soap etc. The air conditioning and heat worked well but overall the bad out weighed the good."

The living area was really comfortable, and although it was an experience to have a spiral staircase, it kept our little dogs downstairs where they belonged. It was just charming. The bedroom and bath area were tranquil. Well supplied kitchen, and very good instructions for wifi. I would check for availability here first if I need a place to stay in the Jacksonville area."

The location is in a great neighborhood, close to everything one may need (food, groceries, shops, restaurants) and centrally located, making Jacksonville exploration easy and convenient. The quarters were immaculate, well-designed and as beautiful as the photos. The place is stocked with all you need for daily life, including a vacuum and mini iron (I was very impressed by these two items). The bed and bedding was super comfy; upstairs was like being in a luxurious treehouse, with vaulted ceilings and windows looking out onto lush greenery. I especially appreciated the off-street parking between the guest house and main house - it couldn't be more secure. Jason was readily available, super helpful and wonderfully accommodating. I would highly recommend his place and would definitely stay here again."

We wish we'd had more time to spend with him as he has vast knowledge about Jacksonville. The location is close to anything you'll need (coffee/bagel shop in walking distance, grocery store the other direction). Jason was also very welcoming to our dog. If you have large dogs it could be a tight fit depending on how energetic they are. Also tough for them to navigate the spiral staircase (although Jason is working on an external staircase). Our dog sleeps downstairs at home so had no issue staying downstairs. If you have a dog recommend you speak with Jason about it!"

It was wonderful to be able to stop for a nice breakfast as I took the dog on his morning walk to Fishweir or Boone Park through lovely neighborhoods. The house itself is well designed, comfortable, and comes with everything you need for your stay. I loved having access to the W/D each week! It was great to have the privacy and quiet of a house, but a place near easy entertainment. Captain Jason even had recommendations for fun dog parks around town. My dog and I enjoyed our stay immensely and will be back! Thanks Captain Jason!"

The apartment is perfectly laid out to have a comfortable stay, you have everything you need, well equipped kitchen, large TV space to eat and work. The decor is very stylish, it has a large garden, and our pet enjoys it very much. Jason is very friendly and is always attentive to help you, he has many recommendations on what to do locally, if you go on Christmas, don't miss St. Agustín and if you like the sweet, don't miss out on mixed feelings. We loved everything, highly recommended!! We hope to go back! Thank you captain!!"

We were within walking distance of a couple restaurants including Bagel Love, and had a dedicated parking spot. Our host was very responsive to our needs. At one point there was a thunderstorm and the power went out briefly and then the internet was down. He had it fixed very quickly. We were also glad to have on site laundry accessible at the main house via the back door. Of note, the spiral staircase was hard for our small dog to navigate so we did carry him up and down. It was close to NAS Jacksonville where I was working and an easy commute. We would recommend for a couple or individual for extended stay."

The airbnb itself was beautiful. On the outside it looks like a quaint white house, but the inside is thoughtfully and tastefully decorated. Everything was clean and organized—looked just like the pics (besides the extra decor—rose petals, candles, etc). The setup is perfect for two people. The backyard is great as well and having the private pool with cabanas is relaxing. Highly recommend and would book again if I’m back in JAX!"

Stayed one night","If you need a place to stay in Jacksonville select Marianna’s place. The location is near downtown in a trendy area with lots of restaurants and shops. We loved the beautiful houses in the neighborhood . The house is unbelievable! It’s so beautifully decorated. I was most amazed at the extra touches Marianna does. There were snacks and drinks (water and some pop) in the refrigerator. There was a great selection of coffee and tea. The bathroom had all toiletries you would need: toothbrushes, suntan lotion, toothpaste, etc. The bed is so comfortable and the bathroom is gorgeous! We took pictures of it and texted them to our kids because the bathroom was so impressive. The weather did not cooperate so we did not use the outdoor area but it is so pretty and relaxing.
Mariana was easy to contact and answered our questions right away. I hope to be back in Jacksonville so we can stay at her place again . I thought the rental price was very resonable."

She made my second stay just as wonderful as the first time. It was my birthday and she made so special by leaving me a bottle of delicious wine, snacks, water, and soda products. Her place is super clean, peaceful, and the decor is beautiful. The soaker tub is relaxing and the ambiance is unmatched. The neighborhood is safe and there were no issues with parking. The pool is always beautiful. Her place is a gem. There are ample delicious eateries and restaurants in the area. Book her place. You will not be disappointed. I promise.

Marianna shines as a host! She is super responsive, she wants you to be comfortable and enjoy every minute of your stay. Last year, we gave her a small suggestion of making a door that was kind of loud quieter and she had the improvement made right away and we were pumped to come back this year to a truly perfect house with a quiet door. She goes out of her way - best Air BNB host we have ever had. This year, we accidentally broke an item and she was super kind about the incident and just wanted to make sure we were okay (which we were.)
The living room, bedroom and bathroom are all super cute, comfy and well-stocked.
We splurged for pool heat this year and using the pool made the trip PERFECT for us.
I am always telling people about this listing. Book away and enjoy the nicest little Air BNB ever! We will be back!"

This home was very beautiful and inviting and it is definitely a place I felt I could escape too for a few days to forget all my worries, the lack of a place to cook honestly made me feel happier having too cook is a daily stressor for me personally the pool area is gorgeous but it’s definitely better at night it’s not the most private pool in the world with the over look from next door but still a nice spot to sit and relax, the bathroom was the cherry on top for me really with the beautiful tub and how you can just sink and watch tv and wash away all your worries 10/10 I will be back here"

Stayed a few nights",We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves on our stay. The first impression from the outside and the neighborhood was quiet and quaint. Marianna has outdone herself on the decor and amenities. Every second it felt luxurious and yet like home. The pool is a welcomed place to relax into the evening with beautiful ambience after a nice day out. The tub was honestly a place I never wanted to leave. It was sooo peaceful. The provided bath bomb and bath-salts felt like a true pampering. The shower was even better with the amazing tile work and overhead rain head. We cannot wait to comeback and experience this special getaway and Marianna’s warm hospitality.

Stayed a few nights","I'm going to be completely transparent. My husband and I were going through a rough patch. I booked this for his birthday in hopes we could rekindle what was lost. This house was so peaceful and allowed us to just love on each other without needing anything. 1st night, ordered a pizza, talked, stayed in the pool and the next day was more relaxing, woke up and immediately spent time by the pool. We needed this and this stay made it easier for us to reconnect. We are rebooking for my birthday because we loved it so much."

We chose this home for a little stay-cation and we left feeling refreshed, rejuvenated, and inspired by our weekend. The attention to detail in this particular home deserves a round of applause. It is so modern with the most charming vintage details. It was so nice to see that they had re-purposed parts of the original home in their remodel. I truly feel that they have thought of EVERYTHING. Most airbnbs come with the bare minimum... not this home. Marianna has made it SO EASY for you to have a worry-free stay. Our entire experience was absolutely incredible and we definitely plan on returning. THANK YOU MARIANNA!"

I love how the bedroom door leads straight to a beautiful private pool area. It’s everything you need down to the bathroom essentials even the kitchen. For the ladies that need a vanity for make up, she’s got you set! Pictures do no justice. BOOK this gorgeous home and see for yourself!

The place was very clean, modern, had everything we needed to feel at home. Marianna was able to decorate for the special occasion! The bathroom was stunning! The pool was an amazing! The only thing was the VERY spotty wifi connection but we figured to just use one tv at a time or connect our hotspot from our phone to the tv. The location was a little off putting at first glance but we were never bothered and felt safe! An easy location for Uber eats to find us as well lots of options! Also the St. John’s town center is only about 15mins away with a strip of restaurants & a great time! I definitely recommend Marianna’s place to everyone! We will be staying again soon!

Aside from the incredible decor and spa like vibe, there is nothing that the super host has not thought of. It rained during our stay (umbrellas on standby). Scuffed my dress shoes (a full shoe polish kit by the front door!). I ate some spicy shrimp and did not have any antacid tablets (Antacid tablets in the drawer!!!). Complimentary light snacks and hydration available. It’s almost like if the Zen Garden didn’t have it, you didn’t need it! This place checks all the boxes and never disappoints. Within short walking distance of a very delicious eatery. Host incredibly responsive and personable. We are already looking forward to another stay!!"

Her home is not only beautiful but you can tell that she really loves what she does and wants to make sure that her guests enjoy every moment in her home. Me and my husband came on our wedding night and Mariana had a beautiful set up for us when we arrived: balloons, roses, petals, candles, a bath set up and more. Her communication was perfect too. Always responding quick. We had no issues while at her home. An extra thing that I love was how STOCKED her home was. She had games, water, ice, coffee and tea, plenty of towels, sunscreen, makeup removing wipes, a sewing kit, aloe gel for sun burns, and so much more. Anything you could possible need during a stay was already there! Me and my husband can’t wait to come back again."

I loved her instructions and recommendations which improved my stay. She's a gem and one of the best host I have came across. Her place is beautiful. I can't say enough as to how beautiful her place is. You have to see it. It was better than the photos. The decor is beautiful, the bed is super comfy, and home is filled with unique touches, amenities and extras I did not expect. I felt as if I was in an upscale hotel, but with much more to offer. It's a great couple's retreat or a solo traveler self-care refuge. The pool was a bonus. I still would have booked this place without a pool. The neighborhood is diverse, peaceful, and close to cafes and restaurants. I felt very safe. I will book again and again. I am so happy to find this gem. Thank you so much Marianna."

Stayed a few nights","Very nice home with almost every need met.
We were treated with a bottle of wine upon arrival and softly playing jazz - nice touch!
The rain style shower was like being in the Amazon Rain Forest. Peaceful and relaxing!
Typically we bring our own linens and pillows - this trip they stayed packed away as the sheets and pillows wrapped around us softly and comfortable.
Complementary bath robes to wear to the private pool set in a tropical paradise right downtown Jacksonville.
The only thing lacking was an outdoor grill.
If you find yourself traveling to Jax,FLA - stay here!"

Stayed one night","Much like the other reviews I can imagine are on here for Marianna’s listing, this place was an oasis away from home. We unfortunately only got one night and a day and half in this beautiful bungalow. Marianna and her team supplied us with things like music playing upon our entrance and security on the outside of the home for our safety. The neighborhood was quiet and hide away from the hustle and bustle but if that keeps you from wanting to pick this place, don’t! It may not be sandy beaches but the private pool will satisfy that, no sand in all your stuff and plenty of shade if needed. The stay was even granted with refreshments in the fridge and reusable ice in the freezer! The bedroom had some of the softest sheets me and my husband have ever slept in and the bathroom… well you gotta see it for yourself! immaculate, very well thought out… i actually thought there wasn’t a toilet at first because it is a little private area in the corner of the bathroom! forgot your soaps or bubble bath foams… no worries Marianna even left us items for the bubble bath! We 100% recommend this beautiful bungalow and look forward to coming back very soon for a longer stay!"

The house was very spacious, wonderful neighborhood and it felt like home! Chanda had absolutely everything we needed for a home away from home! So much so we didn’t have to reach out to Chanda at all! We had no issues! The only time l had to reach out was concerning check out. Our town had just had horrific storms so we didn’t have power so Chanda allowed us a very extended late check out! Chanda was absolutely awesome! I definitely recommend Chanda’s home and having her as a host! We will definitely rent with her again!"

Group trip","“ Feels like home” is the first thing my cousin said when he and his family walked in. As soon as the door opens you are greeted with calming fragrance (I have a thing for how homes smell) and beautiful decor. This is a true family oriented property with a space for kids in the front, a space for teenagers in the media room and relaxing outdoor space for adults. Everything is clean and in working order. The host is the sweetest, she is professional, responsive and flexible. If I could give more than 5 stars I would. We will definitely be reserving this home again, the next time we have family in town. Don’t hesitate, book this home, you will be glad you did!"

Stayed with kids",Chanda’s place was outstanding and much bigger and better than the pictures portrayed it to be. The neighborhood was quiet and well maintained. You could smell the cleanliness as soon as you opened the door. The keyless entry was very easy due to the in depth instructions. We didn’t cook at the property because we were visiting family but everything you need for preparing meals was provided. I stayed with my two boys. They both enjoyed the game system in the theater room along with the game room provided. Beds slept well for all of us. My favorite was the soaking tub after a long day and the nice stand up shower in the master. Plenty of space for larger families as well. The home was very well appointed. Chanda communicated well before and after the trip and was available if needed during the stay. Close to the interstate as well. We will definitely look into staying here again in the future.

Chanda was very helpful from the very first inquiry to the end. Checkin went very smooth. The house was clean and everything was in place. Their ice machine wasn't working but she had ice waiting when we got there. Also, she got us a few bottles of wine (Which I enjoyed because they are my favorite lol). At the last minute I asked for late checkout and she allowed us to stay a little longer. That was very helpful since the night before we didn't do much cleaning after the party. This home also has an outdoor space which is screened in. So we didn't have to worry about any bugs in this Florida heat. All in all I would definitely go through her again. If you are coming to Florida I definitely recommend her. It's worth the money!!"

Stayed over a week","If I could give this 10 stars I would! What a beautiful home. The pictures are good but the house is better. We had an extended stay while we were waiting for construction to finish. It was a stressful time for us. We arrived at the house to find a beautiful basket which was so thoughtful. When I sat down on the sectional in the living room I thought I might never get up. I might have shed a few tears when I left because I will miss it that much. The home is very elegant but so comfortable. The neighborhood is quiet and lovely. You could not ask for a better host. She was such a pleasure. If you are coming to Jacksonville and this house is available, you need to stay here."

Stayed a few nights","If I could give Chanda a rating of #10 instead of a #5 I would. First let's start with the house; Not only was it HUGE, but it was beautiful, and immaculate. Chanda's hospitality and professionalism was awesome, I mean AWESOME!!!!..Before I showed up to the home I mentioned to Chanda that I was coming to Jacksonville to celebrate my birthday...So you can Imagine how surprised I was when I saw two bottles of wine in a beautiful wrapped basket,with two ballons that said Happy Birthday, along with two gift cards, one for Winn Dixie and the other for a restaurant called Cubbys which was less then 5 minutes. away. Thank You so much Chanda for everything."

Stayed a few nights","The host is the most responsive of all the hosts I've had in the past. Self check-in was super easy. The beds were very clean, and so were the toilets. I liked that it was cheaper than a hotel and yet, my adult son could have his own bedroom. There were many towels, soaps, shampoo, and conditioner available. They decorated the place nicely. My son's bathroom had been renovated recently and was very pretty. The only thing, and i dont think it's the host's fault, is that you could tell it's a rental. Some of the doors were damaged (paint missing from people'ssuitcases I assume), the outside chairs were... tired, and the lamp shade was broken. I think a lot of it is that too many guests dont take care of a rental. Overall, I was glad I rented this place since it was clean and had a private space for my son."

Stayed a few nights","You know when you see your place anything to yourself, “ there is no way that is as beautiful as it looks”, well let me tell you it is. As soon as I walked in and took a look around I am really message Jorge told her how beautiful is home was. If this was a standard of Airbnb could be solid fives everywhere. The only reason I put four is there a little snafu with checking in and that was more just a communication aspect of it, yet at the same time I did you rather last minute booking, so I imagine anyone else will be smooth sailing. Jorge has multiple properties and I plan to stay at every single one if I get a chance even after I move here I would just love the opportunity Jorge thanks for the amazing day"

Stayed a few nights","Starting with the positive; the place is cozily and thoughtfully decorated. I think it’s a great deal for the price point & it’s a good place to rest your head at night. Biggest pet peeve was that every night I had to park around the corner, carrying groceries, etc because parking spots were always occupied across the street. Also, I questioned the host if he would allow my family members to be my guest or even come inside, to which his response is that he normally “doesn’t allow more than 2 inside the apartment,” and notes that it is very small. Upon reading the house rules, guests are not allowed, not even for one hour otherwise the reservation will be cancelled and not refunded, being monitored by external cameras…so, they take that pretty seriously around here! Wi-Fi is pretty unstable as it keeps alternating between the various networks nearby and has trouble connecting. Another thing worth nothing is that check out time is before 10AM. Bathroom could use some remodeling."

When brought to the hosts attention he responded with “that’s to bad” & a very defensive paragraph about all the properties he owns and basically saying my feelings weren’t valid & didn’t even ask what had happened. It was so bad we didn’t even stay till the last night. You can also tell how bad of a host jorge is by the way he responds to negative (but true) reviews !!!"

However this unit let me down a bit…! A little more work needed on the unit…
Bathroom light flickered something seriously haunted… The paint was peeling super bad especially on bathroom door… The sofa was light gray yet noticeably dirty to the point we didn’t want to socialize in that area..!
Floors in this unit wasn’t up to par as those I’ve had the pleasure of prior… Definitely not my favorite unit… Photos are better than the unit is in person…"

The host offered to help out on a refund of the cleaning since nothing was touched just need to verify. Never received a refund on the cleaning sent several messages no response. I stated that, I wasn’t going to leave a negative review but felt the need since the host never kept his word. Lesson learned you pay for what you get."

Stayed a few nights","The cleaning chemical smell on arrival was so strong it gave me a headache that lingered into the next day. Had to kill a roach in between the shower curtains. The louvered door into the closet area to the back door had heavy thick, dust in between each crack. The ceiling tiles in front of bathroom and bedroom are falling down to the point you can see the duct work, & very dusty. The doors and windows have a LOT of layers of paint on them, & the noise outside is very well heard since they do not seal. This is an apartment that is accessed by a hallway, which is accessed by all tenants in the building that is three stories. This particular one is on the ground floor. I would not recommend this place to anyone since I expect for every place I stay out of town to at least be the same quality of the house I live in. This was not a safe place for anyone in my opinion! Just not a good experience for me. Hosts were attentive and available, but I didn’t need them for anything."

Stayed a few nights","I think it's necessary to leave honest reviews so I'm gonna be detailed here. The hosts were lovely and very helpful and responsive. The location was decent and the bedroom (we appreciated the black-out curtains!) and living room are reflected well in the listing's photos.
However, in the case of this listing, ""historic"" just means old (ie a lot of stuff crudely patched or painted over a million times). The lighting was super dim everywhere and, though the mattress was pretty comfortable, the bed frame didn't feel very sturdy. I also think the frequencies from other apts' remotes messed with the lights (same fixtures) because the light in the living room kept turning off. There was also a weird smell coming from the fridge and a generally moldy smell in the kitchen/dining room combo... which probably has something to do with the cockroaches we saw. We saw three during our three-day stay, one of which was the biggest cockroach we've ever seen. We ended up sleeping with the dining/living room lights on to keep the roaches in hiding (we only saw them in or around the kitchen).
Overall, it's an ok place to stay if you're gonna be there to just bathe and sleep like we were. Idk, maybe we visited on a bad weekend."

Stayed a few nights","This is a gorgeous little spot. I get what some people are saying about feeling unsafe in the neighborhood but I suspect they’re people with not as much experience with cities. If you’ve ever been to Long Beach in California it’s the same vibe. I didn’t feel unsafe at all (5’2 woman) and there weren’t people standing around. Especially for the money, this was an awesome spot for a weekend. Looks exactly like the photos and all hosts got back to us within a few minutes. Would definitely come again!"

Stayed a few nights","This apartment is perfect for a getaway! It’s so simple, boho, a total vibe. It’s location is close to downtown, main attractions, mom and pop shops, coffee shops, etc. My wife and I really enjoyed our stay, and didn’t want to leave.
One of our favorite things was discovering that the backdoor lead to a backyard that is lit up at night, so cute.
Jorge was very quick on communication. Neighbors are quiet and friendly. Highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","My boyfriend and I came to Jacksonville for my birthday! I wanted to relax and be a beach bum and that’s exactly what I got! We went to Atlantic beach which is about a 30 minute ride out (about the same for Neptune and Jacksonville beaches) however this Airbnb is located to lots of activities near downtown Jacksonville: trinket Shops, a local weekend market, restaurants, a mural walk, some museums , a bookstore and more! If you’re looking for a cute and cozy place for you and your partner to escape for a weekend, I HIGHLY recommend this Airbnb!"

Stayed a few nights","Jorge is a fantastic host; he’s great with communication and answered all my questions within 10mins. The Airbnb is beautiful; it looks EXACTLY like the pictures. I was on a business trip so I needed internet access and the wifi was terrible from the bedroom some moments it worked, then some moments I couldn't open google. For the best wifi connection, I had to be in the living room for service. The only thing is, it’s in a sketchy neighborhood. I had an Uber driver cancel the trip because they didn’t want to pick me up due to location.
Upon booking, I told Jorge that I’d be checking into his Airbnb at 7 pm due to me having a late flight and asked if I could check out at 4 pm on my last day due to my flight being late. He told me no. He stated that check-out is at 10 AM, and I’d have to pay for another night if I wanted to check out that late."

Stayed a few nights","I would definitely tame expectations for this place. The photos are beautiful and it is definitely well-decorated for the modern/boho vibe, however, this is a really old historic building and it shows.
The neighborhood is rough - there are some nice homes sprinkled in and you can tell it's a gentrified neighborhood. I wouldn't feel safe walking by myself because up a block was this gas station that had questionable activities and people there. Despite that, it is a quiet neighborhood and the building itself is quiet at night.
Upon entry, we noticed that it heavily smelled like bug spray but thankfully no bugs our entire stay. The place is really homey and chic, which was appreciated. The AC was also at a very comfortable temperature and was lovely throughout our stay.
The bathroom could use some work. The tub in the shower had a big dip in the center of it and felt as if you were sinking. There was black mold along the caulking of the tub and didn't seem very clean. The ceiling in the hallway between the bathroom and bedroom had some sort of water damage or something...looked like it was falling apart.
The bedroom was spacious and the bed was ok. The wifi is extremely spotty and I would get bumped on and off using it in bed. Really appreciated the ceiling fan though as I love sleeping with a fan at night.
Overall, wasn't a horrible stay but it also wasn't the best. Jorge and his team were extremely responsive and I appreciated the detailed communication and information that was given. They rectified a minor issue upon check-in very quickly so thank you for that! I think with a little more work, the place could be really nice."

Stayed a few nights","I really enjoyed my stay! It’s a cute apartment great for 1-2 people no more than that. The area is slowly building up, so keep that in mind. There are quite a bit of restaurants and shops near by. The Airbnb is 30min from Neptune Beach, 40 min from Amelia Island, 5 min from the Riverwalk and Downtown. I travelled alone and felt safe in the Airbnb. Jorge abs Stephanie were extremely helpful and responsive!"

Stayed over a week","The apartment is a very well decorated space in a historic building. The hosts have done a great job of making it feel cozy and comfortable. Overall a nice place and location; very walkable to the shops on Main, or Silkie's around the corner. ... Only one gripe: the wifi was unreliable, specifically for doing remote work and taking Zoom meetings (basic checking email, etc. was fine)."

The check in process was super easy and Jorge was always very responsive. They gave great recommendations for local food choices too! Street parking is the only thing available however we never had an issue finding a spot. Can’t beat the proximity to downtown. The area surrounding the neighborhood looked a bit rough but we had no issues nor felt unsafe. Overall excellent value and cute space for a weekend getaway.

Stayed one night","It's a perfectly fine spot. Jorge had good coffee, nice breakfast snacks, and plenty of cookware in the kitchen. The house is comfy and nicely decorated and has a good layout. The neighborhood is pleasant, though just a few blocks away from less developed areas. All of the houses around the block are very nice looking, old historic houses with good lighting at night.
Parking was easy, we were always able to park near the apartment. In winter months, the heat doesn't get back to the bedroom very efficiently but it wasn't too bad. There's a space heater in the closet in case you need it, but only one blanket provided. Overall it's a nice space for a reasonable price and we enjoyed our stay."
