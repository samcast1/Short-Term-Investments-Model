Stayed with kids","We enjoyed 4 nights in Vincennes at this home away from home. A great size for a small family - cozy space, and everything we needed. Visiting in spring, the weather could vary from cool to very warm and we really appreciated Andrea checking in to see if the temp in the space was comfortable. We had a great spring break trip here. Grateful to Andrea for having us!"

Stayed about a week","We thoroughly felt at home at Angie's place. It was well stocked in the kitchen and VERY clean! Beds were comfortable, lots of towels, and extra blankets for TV viewing. The enclosed front porch was a nice extra as a place to relax. Parking off the street was convenient. My only concern is that there are a few very steep steps at the front door - would not be handicap accessible if needed. Thanks for everything, Angie!!! We would definitely stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","Perfect central spot for what we needed. It is very much an old office converted, And there are things that are “officy”- but Andrea made sure to include everything you could need and it is very comfortable . Plus I had to work so the desk area was very useful. The laundry mat down the street was a little father than I hoped, but it was still close enough to allow me to do a load. Ladies, bathroom lighting for makeup is perfection. Mommas, Instacart does deliver but not many drivers. Recommend using Walmart delivery instead. It was very fast!! If we’re ever driving back thru, we’d love to stay again"

Stayed a few nights","This home was very spacious, clean and comfortable. The open kitchen, dining and living room were welcoming and suitable for family or multiple guests. There was a nice sized deck for relaxing, a beautiful tree for natural shade and a spa (did not use the spa, so not sure it worked, but I imagine it would be great!). There was also a BBQ that we did not check out, but it was available. When I had a question I texted the host (they left their contact number for us), and the response was right away. I even had to call early on a Saturday morning and the host was very helpful and pleasant.
This location is a good deal for the money. Note that 2 of the 4 bedrooms have 2 twin beds in each- so suitable for children, not adults. I would stay there again."

Stayed a few nights","This has an absolutely terrific set up for a tiny house. I have stayed in many tiny houses, but very few have a washer and dryer. I absolutely love the Set up. I am thinking fall and spring are some of the best times to stay here as there’s a good little light available for grilling, using a fire pit, and a picnic bench with a nice park only a few steps away. Sue is fantastic and literally right there if you needed her. They did a great job with this place. Please note that it is not a cabin, like you would think of In the middle of nowhere on top of a Mountain, ￼It’s simply a play on words. It is set up like a cabin, but it is a tiny house in the middle of a country town. That is perfect… Absolutely perfect.￼ Thank you, Sue, and Charlie for being so hospitable. I’ll be back.￼"

Stayed a few nights","Sue was very friendly and responsive. We had a great weekend, as we were not looking for local attractions. We just planned to be in a secluded cabin and go to the off road park. The place was nice but just know it is a fixed up shed and is on a street corner with old mobile homes behind it. The other reviews, the word 'entire' in the description and the price made it seem like we were renting a full size cabin that was more secluded. Again, the Carousel Cabin is a nice little place for a single or young couple for a weekend and Sue was a very good host."

They quickly became family to me! Their warmth, kindness, and generosity were out of this world! Sue and Charlie would always make sure I got my packages of books for school and Sue brought over many hot meals! I also got a tour of the town and great recommendations for places to eat! Being away from the city was so peaceful and just what I needed. Sue and Charlie made me feel right at home from day one! For me it was an unforgettable experience and the best air B&B hosts I have ever had! Sue and Charlie are amazing people and I’m sure going to miss staying there! They went above and beyond in meeting expectations and provided a cozy, quiet, and peaceful place to stay! I can’t say enough about how wonderful they are and my stay was! I hope to come back soon! To anyone looking for a great stay, look no further! This is a stellar stay!"

Our only complaints were that the beds weren’t very comfortable and the furniture was sparse—could have used a proper coffee table and a full-length mirror. Overall, it suited our needs and was a more affordable option than the local hotels."

Stayed a few nights","Nice, but small- which we knew. Beds were comfy- plenty of pillows/blankets; kitchen was well stocked with items needed. Bathroom is tiny, bathtub was tough to get into for a few of us elderly, and there were no safety bars; but it was clean, and we managed.
Visit the park across the street, it’s beautiful and a nice view from the front porch. It’s a nice walk. The house is convenient to everything in Vincennes.
We found that loading and unloading from the back porch was much easier for us. And it was convenient…and we felt that it was safer for our car so it wasn’t parked on the street.
Some suggestions for owner: 1. some sort of table for eating on- msybe a coffee table that pulls up to table height; 2. Full length mirror somewhere ;3. Written instructions inside the house for check out.
Overall, nice place, we would stay again. Thank you!"

Stayed one night","I came to Vincennes on 4/20/23 for an event at Vincennes Univ for my son. My late husband's 80 yr old Aunt came w/me. After a full day of traveling, an evening of visiting & exploring, & rain storms coming in, we decided to skip stay the night rather than drive 3.5 hours back home. I called the hotel I usually stay at but the few rooms left were far more costly than usual, as were all other hotels. I finally remembered Airbnb but since it was now 10pm, I wasn't sure I'd get a response. I was pleasantly surprised Vince & his local manager responded very quickly. DJ met us there & assisted my Aunt w/the stairs & me w/our luggage. We enjoyed chatting w/him while we settled in. Note: Beds on the firmer side comfy w/lots of cozy pillows & blankets! Shower has great water pressure! Basement has lots usable space. Only wish: Front porch chairs to enjoy that stunning view of the Monument!! We 100% loved our stay! I hope to bring my kids & grands to explore Vincennes & stay your other home!"

The vaulted ceiling, industrial brick walls and metal window frames made this a unique place to spend the night.
Sound and light carried throughout the space, because there are walls to divide the rooms but no traditional plaster ceilings covering each room.
Despite this, I would stay there again. It was calming and homey- a plus with children in tow! The accommodations were very clean and comfortable."

Group trip","The location matched the host's description and our expectations.
Being a loft space, privacy is lessened compared to a more traditional residence--the room walls do not reach the building's roof, so sound carries throughout the entire space. This isn't an issue if you know what to expect, but some folks who signed the guestbook apparently did not anticipate this when booking.
We stayed during a spectacular total solar eclipse in the city, and this space provided a location that was easily walkable to the main community celebration and to some of the local restaurants and shops. The shortage of lodging in the area for the event drove up prices for accommodations, but this listing offered a relatively reasonable value compared to other nearby options.
The host was very friendly, and her responses to any questions we had were prompt and helpful.
This was our first Airbnb stay, and we can only hope that future bookings will be as smooth and pleasant as Jessica helped make this one."

Group trip","Excellent place to stay in Washington. Very spacious and very affordable. Highly recommend.
Only caveat's:
It is a loft as described, and the walls do not go all the way to the ceiling. Thus sound travels and this includes Bathrooms. They do include some white noise machines and that did help. But be aware of this.
Parking can be tricky in that you can park in front of the place, but you may be the only car on the road. I didn't feel comfortable being the only car parked there, so I parked on the side of the building. However, I had to move first thing Monday morning so that i wasn't in the way of the work trailers parked there.
Finally, the master bed/bathroom does not have a door between the bathroom and the bedroom. So be aware of that.
Overall though a wonderful stay and I'd definitely stay there again."

We notified the owner and he came out immediately and told us everything working fine and that no one else had complained. We went to bed and, in the morning, we tried again to fill the tub. The hot water ran out before the tub was half full. There were dozens of dead flies and one cockroach. There were 2 gas fireplaces but neither worked. This place has so much unreached potential."

Group trip","Overall our stay worked and was fine.
I appreciated: Shane’s responsiveness, super easy check-in, plenty of towels, toiletries if you need them, hangers in the closet, nice carpet, extra blankets, heat and ac work quickly,
Could be better:
-One of the bedrooms did not have a door (open to the kitchen) and made it annoying and loud and less private for the person sleeping there.
-The only bathroom is in between two of the bedrooms so if you have to pee in the night you have to go through someone’s room to get to it.
-There was an annoying and somewhat loud banging/popping sound that came through the air vents intermittently (even through the night).
-There was no dishwasher and only one mug (but plenty of regular drinking glasses).
Things to note:
- The area of town is shabby (as is most of the town) but we didn’t have any issues.
-Some of the doors didn’t close/open well.
-The curtains are not opaque, so bring an eye mask if you need a dark room."

Stayed one night","What an amazing place, Teresa's listing reminds you of why you choose Airbnb's over hotels. The smell you are welcomed with when walking in lets you know that this place is going to be clean - and it delivers. Everything is spotless, attention to detail in literally everything. The room has everything you could need plus more. I was so thankful to open the fridge and find a cold water in there, with snacks upon entering as well. It was peaceful and quiet (in the room, the lobby, and outside). Bed was comfy and a basket of varying types (thankyou) of blankets helped create a cozy vibe. Teresa was extremely kind and double checked to make sure I got the check in details - she radiates positivity. If I had anything negative to say about Teresa's place, it would only be so no one else booked it up hahah. Truly perfect, thank you!!"

It is in an urban/city location with parking lots nearby, but the outside is nicely decorated and an attractive library is across the street. A bonus is the amazing donut shop a 2 minute walk away.

Teresa was an excellent hostess and has such a sweet heart. Honestly I wish I could have paid more for how much I was accommodated for.
Even though, if you want to do something around the area is limited. If I ever had to stay a night somewhere this would definitely be the first spot I would look for in the area.

We were able to allow our pup to wander around the land while we sat and took in the scenery. The deck and outdoor lights created the best ambiance. The inside of the house was spotless and up to date, which is especially impressive in a rural location. The amenities, decorations, thoughtful touches (snacks AND wine!), and the communication were all top notch. We were even able to go to the Farmer's Market on Saturday, which was a great experience all on its own. Our stay exceeded our expectations. I hope to stay here again in the future and I would 100% recommend it to friends and family."

A small fenced in area out back would be marvelous since its pet friendly.
TV in bedroom. The tv reception was poor.
There maybe some lights out in kitchen and living room."

Most of the store’s /restaurants were closed by the time we Checked in, so that was kind of disappointing . We did go to impressed coffee and it was super affordable and a cute place. We actually just enjoyed the place! The beds were comfortable and everything was clean! Lots of nice touches in the place, we loved that the coffee was provided and all the fixings! :) Candace was on top of the communication and even let us know we could take out time and not rush for check out! We would definitely stay here again! Our teens loved the place!!"

Stayed a few nights","This location was unique and had a special flair to it. Very cool modern farmhouse décor, multi-level and open, gave the feeling of being ""connected"" to those staying, but had areas for privacy as well. Eclectic. Kitchen was well stocked, everything was very clean and not cluttered. Bed's were comfortable. Air conditioning was great and really needed during the heatwave! The ""master bedroom"" was missing AC, but they did provide fans and it turned out just fine. One note, there are stairs, so if there is a guest who cannot go up and down stairs (i.e. uses a walker), this is not the place for them.
I would definitely stay here again, the host was very pleasant and as mentioned, the interior was really special. One other note- the entrance if through an alley and returning alone at night was a little discerning. That said, the alley was well lit and I wont feel that way my next stay, just calling it out."

It could have been a huge mess but DJ moved us down the road to another house for the last night so it all worked out great. He was extremely understanding and willing to get it worked out for us even though I’m the one that messed up my dates! Highly recommend staying at any of the houses they offer!

For the price I paid here to house my crew, I would have had to pay double or more for multiple hotel rooms were you have to walk up and own stairs, share space with people you don’t know, etc. Here, we were able to get off work and relax. My wife came and cooked meals so I was able to save money on eating out too. We had a very nice stay."

Stayed about a week","My family and I loved our week long stay at this beautiful Airbnb in Vincennes, IN. The location is right on a main road, but in a peaceful rural area. I enjoyed seeing rabbits and American robins during the day and numerous sparkling stars in the sky above at night. My aunt especially enjoyed the kitchen. We ended up cooking at home each day instead of eating out at a restaurant because the space really does feel like a home away from home. My family was also impressed by the amenities, which really exceeded our expectations. There was plenty of cookware, dinnerware, and linens. And most importantly, COFFEE! The weather was cold during our stay, so there being plenty of extra cozy blankets was a huge plus.
Vince truly is an excellent host. It's like he anticipated everything we'd need, so I didn't have to contact him during our stay with any concerns or questions. If available, I would like to stay at this property again. Thank you."

The sun room is the crowning glory, with a view that is calming and restful. I watched a squirrel on the play equipment and thought he'd go down the slide, but he didn't. That was the only disappointment of our stay!
We would most probably rent again when visiting family in Vincennes.

Stayed a few nights","It was our first time booking on Airbnb and it couldn’t have been better. We were in for a golf tournament and some r&r. The house was literally 2 blocks from the 3rd tee box and right down the road from everything else that was needed. Kaylee allowed us to use our portable gas grill (used in the driveway away from the house), and we ate great home cooked meals like we were at home. We really enjoyed our stay and would stay again."

The house is simple but comfortable and clean. And Kaylee was an excellent host - quick to communicate with us and answer our questions. The house is on a busy road and there is some traffic noise. If you are a light sleeper, pack ear plugs. We always travel with earplugs so it was no bother to us. This home is a great value and served us very well."

The kitchen, family rooms/TV room, and master bedroom are the most wonderful places for family together if you have a big group. Very spacious. The basement is huge. The beds are great, but the noise level of the heating and air-conditioning unit is very loud. The family that was going to sleep down there ended up sleeping upstairs. However, it would be a great area for playing games, and let kids runoff steam. My family enjoyed this place very much."

We also heard loud mufflers throughout the night and a nearby bar blared music until 3am. That being said, the house was plenty spacious and clean.

Each space was carefully decorated with small resting areas away from the main living area. Perfect for group and family travel as it provides quiet areas for people to rest and relax.
The beds were EXCEPTIONALLY comfortable. The best I've experienced in nearly 10 years of using AirBnB.
Naomi was very responsive to any questions or comments and I enjoyed our limited interaction.
Definitely a treasure for the town of Washington and the surrounding Knox and Daviess counties.
P. S. We ate breakfast everyday at Benjy's and were never disappointed."

Stayed a few nights","This house has been remodeled, and still has that “new house” smell that makes you feel like you’re the first to stay-which we loved! The builder went above and beyond with the updates, and the decor is very inviting and modern. The beds were very comfy, and the open floor plan lent itself well for family time. The house was spotless!"

Stayed one night","Grace's Downtown Loft Apartment is better than the description.
While it is described as two bedroom, 2 bath, the apartment is roomy! With bedrooms on opposite ends of a long hall, all sleep perfectly.
It is an renovated old building when you walk in, but trust me, keep walking!
The decor is industrial (open beam ceiling) meets country chic (adorable chalk painted retro outside/modern inside refrigerator), meets glam (gorgeous lighting and massive clawfoot soaking tub). Her style is impeccable.
No worries if you forgot something because Grace certainly did not. There are plenty of closets with hangers, a filtered water pitcher, a basket of hair clips by the soaking tub, 3 types of hair curling irons, clothes iron and steamer, a variety of book genres, comfy sofas and beds, lots of towels, and new kitchen appliances.
There is plenty of parking nearby. The ability to carry your luggage up a high staircase is a must.
I'll no longer select the Hampton. Grace is truly a super host!"
