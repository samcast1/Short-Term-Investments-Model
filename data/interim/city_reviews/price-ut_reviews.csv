Stayed with kids","I can't say enough good about Sarah's place. We will definitely stay here again -- we're already dreaming about our next happy stay. Sarah's place was just what we were looking for, somewhere quiet and secluded where we could just relax as a family. We watched movies, played games, did a puzzle, went on walks, enjoyed evenings around the outdoor fire, cooked meals and ate together at the large dining room table. Heating/cooling was responsive and comfortable. The beds were incredibly comfortable and Sarah has all the amenities we needed. She was a fantastic host, so flexible, communicative, and hospitable. This is a gem!!! Also, some others have mentioned the train. It is not very loud. No horn blowing, just a low and quiet rumble if everything is very quiet. I wouldn't let it stop you from booking. It certainly wasn't an issue for us. Thank you, Sarah, for a wonderful stay! We loved every minute and appreciate your hospitality so much!"

Stayed with kids","We were pretty excited to find this place. My mom rented it the week before only to find out it is the house my grandfather built around 1950. A lot has changed, but it's still the house we spent many nights in growing up. Sarah has done a wonderful job updating it (as it was definitely needed) while still keeping with the old charm. Since it's winter, the orchard isn't growing, but I'd love to see it again in the summer.
If we have any reason to come back, I will definitely try to book here again just for the personal nostalgia ❤️."

We worked remotely all week, and the space and wi-fi was exactly what we needed. Kitchen is well stocked and the views from the windows toward the canyon are beautiful!! Overall it was just what we needed and we'll definitely bookmark it as a stay to return to in the future. And - for anyone concerned about the trains mentioned in the description: the train tracks are very close by as described, but we never found the passing trains bothersome. They were never louder than maybe a big car driving by. In a way it was a fun little detail of the environment!"

Stayed one night","This place was huge and very nice and clean! Very private even though it’s attached to some sort of workshop or something, but we never saw anyone else. I will say that the lighting was very harsh in almost every room and there was no way to use less lighting or dim the lights. It was either all or nothing and some of the lights didn’t have covers which made them more harsh. No window coverings either so it kinda has a fishbowl feeling. Outside has benches which would have been nice to sit on for morning coffee but none of them had cushions on them so we couldn’t sit outside. We loved the Bose stereo in the kitchen (haven’t seen one since the 90s) and loved rocking out to the NKOTB cd! Overall it was a safe and clean place to stay. Another tip-bring your own coffee and drinking water."

Stayed one night","This house is beautiful and cozy. The three of us felt very comfortable. We made a lovely dinner and found the kitchen to be well suited to our cooking needs. The house is right off of the highway so there is some highway and train noise, but the view of the mountains is wonderful and the sitting area in the backyard looks over a beautiful old orchard. The flat screen tv doesn't have any components other than a cable to connect to your computer so you won't be able to watch anything unless you bring a lap top, but this wasn't an issue for us. All in all we had a wonderful stay and Sarah was so responsive when we needed help trouble shooting something. This is a great place to stop and have a cozy evening or two."

Stayed with kids","Home was very clean aside from dishes in the dishwasher and the shower hadn't been cleaned. Couch and beds were very comfortable and its very spacious. Kitchen was well equipped. A backdoor was left open when I arrived so the house was extremely cold and it took almost 6 hours to get back up to 70°. It is located on a very noisy and busy road with traffic driving past after midnight on weekdays. The outside of the home seems to be under construction still with a work truck and trailer parked there, ladders and tools outside the doors, and a missing gutter system that left us with lots of ice. There was a bag of salt on the porch but it was empty. Based on the inside, I'm sure this house is going to be very nice to stay at when the remodel is finished. It was comfortable for our stay and we would stay again."

It would be wonderful for having a family stay here as the kitchen, living room and the bedrooms were all quite large. It was a very easy check-in process with the door code I was given. The place looks just like the photos. When I showed up the drive way was shoveled as well. One thing I was a little confused about was there was just a bunch of old food in the fridge. I’m not exactly sure what that was about but it was still very clean and had everything you would need to cook and clean. I would highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","It was an honor, to stay at Sarah's home, traveling from San Diego, Ca, to visit our son, dor 4 days, who lives and work in Helper. It was great experience to stay at Sarah's home. We truly appreciate how She accommodated us with our last minute booking, the home is located near Helper main street, and close to Price. Sarah's home is private and, located on a acres of open land. We enjoyed nice view of the mountains, and the stars were absolutely gorgeous. We loved the spacious rooms, and the beautiful layout of the bathroom. This place had all the amenities, and kept nice and warm for those 15 degree nights. My family will definitely stay here again. We are also exited to see the amazing things you continue to do with your home, and land.
Thank you,

Stayed a few nights","What a pleasant home to stumble across near Helper, Utah. It was much larger than my husband and I needed, but for the price we couldn't beat it. The home is a beautiful multi story home with a private hot tub, large beautiful kitchen with a great living space. it would be much better suited for a family or multiple couples. The town of Helper is less than 1.5 miles from this place with a wonderful coffee shop and a restaurant called Balance Rock.
The bedrooms are located upstairs and in the finished basement. There are 3 bedrooms upstairs with 2 bathrooms and washer/ dryer in one. The 2 other bedrooms were in the finished basement with another bathroom. When the owners are completed with upgrades, there will be a full bath on the main level of the home. The stairs going to the upper floor are not for the faint of heart for sure so make sure you are aware of that.
This was truly a beautiful home and great place to stay! Owners were very easy to get a hold of it needed. GREAT PLACE!"

Stayed with a pet","Nice place, Mike responds fast and answers questions. It’s a nice place. Like most of the houses in the area, it’s an older home with small rooms, but it has been really nicely updated with modern finishes and they did a nice job squeezing amenities and fun art and decor into the small spaces. We were there on some really cold nights but the house was warm and comfortable, and it was nice having extra warm blankets available. Really appreciated the dog door to the dog run, that is handy for middle of the night potty breaks.
The house has one bedroom on the main level and two in the basement. We were traveling with my stubborn elderly parents who don’t get around very well, but who insisted on taking one of the basement bedrooms. They had difficulty navigating the steep stairs. That’s not a problem with the house, just something to be aware of depending on who is in your group."

We took the dogs for a nice walk around the neighborhood and enjoyed the views of the surrounding mountains. We enjoyed some of the food items that previous guests had left and Michael generously said we could eat.
Overall, we enjoyed staying here and would be happy to stay again."

We had to circle the neighborhood to find the carport to park, but that could've easily been a Maps error. Other than that, it was very easy to get to! Inside, there were a lot of pretty decorative pieces that we've never seen before, and the art was gorgeous. We were able to wash our clothes downstairs with full laundry supplies, and my little chihuahua got to use a doggy door for the first time! I also like how the doggy door had a cover so our cats couldn't escape. The host was very accommodating and even offered to mail us our hoodies we left behind. 10/10 would recommend this place for a comfortable quiet stay."

Helper is an adorable town that’s really attempting to attract us adventuresome, off the beaten path type of people. We arrived and departed by train which we highly recommend as a means of travel. Everything is centrally located and within easy walking distance to whatever secrets of this fab town you want to discover. We found a great spot to hike just walking toward the cliffs surrounding the town and following the narrow dirt roads (4wheeler or fire roads?) Also followed the river walk to it’s end. Would certainly stay again! Thank you for such a lovely stay!"

Stayed with a pet","Everything was great about the house. There is plenty of space, it is close to downtown and the highway and it was comfortable. It was easy to find and park. The issue we had with the property pertains it being dog friendly. The ""yard"" is not accessible from the actual home. There is a very small doggy door that goes out there, but there is no other way to get to the yard without going through the open driveway. It was a bit tough to deal with two dogs going to the yard without a good way to get there, especially in the middle of the night. Other than that detail, it was an easy experience."

I’m pretty sure they roll up the sidewalks then and you can’t find anything! To the end, though, having a little bit of food in the house from the host was so welcome, and so appreciated!

It was especially nice that he has a a smart TV in the living room and a cable ready one down stairs that offers Roku. A nice patio on the side and Sun flower around the side and Mountains all around. There was a toy closet for the kids. There was a park near by for swimming and to sit or eat lunch. I would give Michael 's place a 10.

The decor is interesting and I wish I had spent more time taking photos. The kitchen was so well stocked and everything was really clean. The host was great about sharing information and responding to questions. The photos don’t do justice to how lovely the house is! I genuinely hope to stay here again the next time I’m in Utah.

Stayed with a pet","Notable: fenced in yard. Mini split air conditioner in both bedrooms for total climate control where you sleep - I can’t say I’ve ever been spoiled in that way by an airbnb. A significant investment on Janis’s part for sure. Immaculately clean.
But that’s just the start of it!
What a gem of a place. It is almost difficult to believe the level of care put into this home. When you see the front yard you will know exactly what I mean. Enter and it just keeps getting better!
Janis accommodated us last minute with amazing communication. Beautifully decorated and generously supplied. High quality linens/bedding/finishing - everything definitely seems like family heirloom type, so homey and a breath of fresh air from the Amazon catalog. Truly feels like a home, not a hotel, and definitely not a flip.
Clearly she has invested significant expense and forethought into her place and we are lucky she shared it with us. Top 3 I’ve ever stayed in, at any price range!
Thank you!"

We had booths at the arts festival so didn't spend much actual time in the house, but it was lovely to come home to at the end of a long day and just relax. We really appreciated the snacks and cold water when we arrived and the fresh made banana bread was a special treat. The beds were comfortable and such a lovely yard! It sounds funny but the shower was lovely and tall! My son is 6'5"" so he appreciated that! I loved the peace and quiet and the trains made me feel at home. We definitely look forward to staying there again!"

They even lent me a ratchet strap when they saw I broke a buckle packing down my gear to depart. Best of all, there were parties on the counter from a local bakery. I'm staying there again on my way back through the area and rearranged my trip a bit so that I could have a little more time here and check out the town.
You'll love this place, it's better then the ad makes it seem."

There is a park and playground almost across the road, a very short walk from the house. The next door neighbors were quiet and friendly. The train does blow its horn as it passes through town, even if it's the middle of the night, but the tracks right by the house didn't lead to much noise."

We loved seeing the trains, especially getting to watch the California Zephyr go by every morning and evening. VERY fast Wifi (100mb down/100mb up) with a dedicated router in the house for a strong signal. Janis was a lovely host and gave us clear check-in instructions, checked in with us to make sure everything was going well, and was very accomodating in allowing my husband's parents to come hang out with us at the house.

She knew when we wanted to have a conversation. She knew when we wanted to be left alone. She completely followed our lead. The beds are extremely comfortable. She is totally honest about the fact that there are trains out the back room. The front bed room is very quiet. I am a very light sleeper and slept greatAll three nights that I was there. The house has so many sweet touches. The kitchen is fully stocked. She offers treats and a warm welcome note. She was available literally all of the time to answer my many questions.There is an excellent washing machine, dryer, and a big close line outside. There is a sweet hummingbird theme throughout the house and real hummingbirds outside the house. Helper is a really fun town and worthwhile exploring. Janice knows a lot about helper. She is totally accommodating with anything that we needed."

Stayed over a week","We stayed here for two weeks. The price is fantastic and the house is very cozy, private, clean and comfortable. Helper is a unique little town with a lot of history we did not know about. We enjoyed being part of community and staying at Janis’ house made the whole stay very comfortable. All her small touches made it feel like home. Recommend for anyone seeking a place to stay for just a night or two or for a long-term rental. It’s a great spot!"

Stayed a few nights","The house was super clean and cute. Janis left us a welcome note and treat. You could tell she thought of all of the details. She also had room fresheners in the closets There were small conditioners, soaps, and shampoos. The front bedroom has a bed that is automatic and rolls up. There are televisions in both bedrooms and living room. Each bedroom has it’s own climate controls. Janis was very responsive and helpful. She had clear instructions and an information binder. I would totally stay here again."

Stayed a few nights",We had such a wonderful stay! Janis is a very thoughtful host and we felt very welcome there. We brought our dogs with us and the yard in the back was perfect. We loved walking them through the town and along the river (they even did okay on the swinging bridge!). Helper is such a cute town! We would definitely recommend staying here.

Stayed a few nights","Really enjoyed our stay in this little gem of a house! So many thoughtful touches that made us feel very comfortable and at home without actually feeling like we were sleeping in someone else's house. Loved all the info about local attractions, food places, etc. Views are lovely at sunrise and sunset. Janis was a wonderful host, very communicative & really went above and beyond. Bedding & towels were soft & smelled fresh and really appreciated the functional kitchen (groceries not included!) Although we didn't use the coffee maker (main street has the CUTEST most tasty coffee shop) we appreciated the availability. Will definitely stay here again!"

Bed was extremely comfortable. Parking easy. Conveniently located on the main street of Helper. My only feedback is that it was a little challenging to find at night but we did appreciate the motion sensor lights. Would stay again for sure!

This space was able to handle our tired bones after a 9-hour drive. Thanks to the coffee provided in the morning, we started out on the right foot to push forward the next day.
The property owners are easy to talk to and very kind. I would recommend staying here for a quick stop or to stay and play a while."

Stayed one night","Great value in Helper, Utah. My friend and I stayed here during an Amtrak layover and it was exactly what we needed—a clean, safe space to sleep in for a couple hours. It exceeded our expectations and beyond what is pictured, it even had a portable electric stove and basic seasonings. We didn't use it because we weren't there for a long time, but were impressed they were available. I also appreciated the ability to adjust the temperature of the room.
Everything was spotless, including the bathroom which was similarly well-stocked with bath gel, shampoo, conditioner, and towels. There's a space heater in there too which we didn't use, but again, appreciated. Although we had a small issue, the hosts were quick to reply despite the late hour with a reasonable explanation."

It was very easy to find and we settled in immediately and had a great stay! My kids especially loved petting and playing with the 3 resident cats on the property. :) And Helper was a super cute little town that was fun to walk around after a long car ride. As a mother traveling solo with her two kids, security and ease and comfort are all priorities and Lita’s place checked all the boxes! Thank you for hosting us so last minute!"

Prefer it over Price. Made spur of the moment reservation to avoid camping in poor weather. Was just in for the evening to connect with our son who was in Price for work. Lita was very helpful when the lock on our camper froze buy getting out her hairdryer! Thank you

If Tim and Lita knew they’d be unavailable for the evening, things should have been double checked. One KCup for the keurig is not coffee. There were no paper towels in the kitchen or hand towel in the bathroom.
Otherwise, it was excellent to have a comfortable king sized bed.
We got no personal communication via the Airbnb app at all. They should have told us before our reservation they’d be at a concert and unavailable to assist."

It just has so many thoughtful features that most studio airbnbs don't offer (i.e., a desk, armoire, AC, full-size fridge, etc.) It's a fantastic value for everything it offers.
It's also surprisingly quiet (even though it's right on main street), and we felt really safe the whole time. We also fell in love with the little town of Helper! Definitely take a stroll down the street if you have time.
We were also fortunate enough to have met Lita, and she was super friendly and helpful throughout our stay!"

Stayed one night","We got super lucky that Lita & Tim’s place happened to be available as we were approaching Helper, UT and feeling like we needed to stay overnight somewhere on our road trip from Vail, CO to SLC, UT. We booked instantly and received clear check in instructions within seconds.
We were met by Lita when we arrived and she was hospitable, kind and down to earth. The “loft feel” space was extremely clean, really cute and everything we needed!
For dinner, we took a short walk to Balance Rock Eatery & Pub (Lita’s recommendation) and it was delicious, quick, fresh and the service was great!
We slept soundly in the most comfortable bed. The place was quiet and dark and with the windows open the temperature inside was perfect (Mid September). We slept so comfortably in fact, we slept in. I’d say that’s a great indicator of a perfect place to rest your noggin on a road trip through Helper!
The coffee that was provided was delicious and loading in and out was easy because the driveway pulls you up right outside the front door!
Truly, for sleepy road trippers who want a seamless overnight stay, you can’t go wrong staying here!
We’d love to stay here again when we travel through. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

The room is dark with the curtains closed so daytime naps are nice. The bed is sooo comfy and the shower pressure is excellent, as is temperature control, nice and hot! Definitely a very clean stop. I especially enjoyed saying hi to their cat on our way to the car after checking out. Loved this stay!"

We were very happy with our stay. No WiFi is advertised, so don’t be surprised by this. We wish there would have been satellite tv, but it wasn’t a deal breaker. That’s not why we visited; it just would have been nice after a long day hiking to sit back and watch a movie with the kids.
The house is very neat and clean and exactly as advertised in the listing. We would definitely stay here if we come through Price again."

Living room seating was comfortable and the kitchen had (bare) essentials. You get what you pay for."

Stayed over a week","The place was very nice, pretty clean, and the hosts were great and easy to communicate with! I wish it was a little bit more clear that there is no wifi, especially for a longer stay, that would have made the stay better and more worth the money. Other than the lack of wifi though, the stay was very enjoyable."

Stayed with kids","This was a great spot for the price we paid, although the taxes and fees were over 100% the room rate, which is steep.
The home has plenty of room for 1-4 guests. The kitchen is well equipped with just about any appliance and utensil you may need. Restroom was well stocked with quality towels and soaps.
Unfortunately the mattress in the back room is one of those memory foams and I ended up sinking into it when lying on it; it be nice if the mattress offered more support. Guests also cannot control the temperature of the home, and it did get a little too warm at night."
