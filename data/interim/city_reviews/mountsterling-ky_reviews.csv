Group trip",Amanda is very welcoming and responsive. The place is accurately described and has lots of space. The farm fresh eggs and cookies were a nice surprise and we enjoyed playing pool in the evenings. For large groups the extra refrigerators will be handy. Thanks for sharing your place with us!

Lots of space, plenty of things to do and very clean. Amanda & Bill were wonderful top notch hosts. We enjoyed the chocolate chip cookies and farm fresh eggs. I highly recommend! This place will be at the top of our list the next time we visit Winchester."

And of course, we love feeding the baby calf. We had a blast and looking forward to our return. Will be glad to recommend this farm for a fantastic place to stay. Thanks again."

Stayed with kids","If you’re reading this review trying to decide if you want to stay at Amanda’s place, do it! Her hospitality was top shelf. So many little touches that makes you feel right at home. Amanda communicated with us often and made sure we had everything we needed. We had 10 people and plenty of room. The house has great farmhouse cozy charm with a lot of history to read about and see in photos. This is the best airbnb stay we’ve ever had. I would definitely recommend and will be back. Thanks Amanda!"

The antiques provoked stories about ancestors. We didn’t even turn on a television. Very relaxing time amongst 4 generations. Sadly, our visit was very short. Thank you for the cookies and card, both made us smile!"

The house was very clean and had everything we needed plus more. The kitchen was fully equipped and we loved playing games on the large table in the dining room. I can't say enough about Amanda the host. She was so flexible as our group size changed, and set up the beds in a perfect way to accommodate our group. She put fresh eggs from the farm in the fridge for us and even set out snacks for us to take on our hike. She looked up restaurants, and was extremely helpful. This house was wonderful and Amanda was the best host I've ever had with an Airbnb. I would stay here again in a second."

Stayed about a week","Our family had an outstanding time at this farm. I loved that the home was clean. You can tell they want to offer the best experience by tending to a guest needs with extra touches throughout the home.
Throughout the home you can learn the history of the area. As animal lovers we loved having a chance to pet the friendly, tame farm animals.
For breakfast we were able to purchase farm fresh eggs and it added to experience of staying at the farm.
This home was so conveniently located to all the places we wanted to visit. I loved that Lexington was 30mins away.
My favorite part of Winchester was the downtown. The local coffee shops were fantastic, the restaurant offered outstanding food and the farmers market on Saturday was so cultivating. We purchased local honey and vegetables that we used in our meals.
The hosts definitely made us feel welcome."

Amanda responded right away, and gave us time when deciding if we needed to extend our stay. She also answered at least 20 questions for me, which made the planning process easier. She left fresh baked cookies that everyone enjoyed after a hard day. She allowed us to meet the pastor at her house which made us feel more comfortable during such an emotional time. The house was clean and great for kids, with lots to do. My family will never forget their kindness towards us and plan to book in the future."

She went above and beyond to make us feel welcome.
We had a very large group, with 9 children, and had plenty of space and comfortable sleeping arrangements.
Amanda baked us fresh chocolate chip cookies (her grandmother's recipe) and provided fresh eggs from the farm.
She and her husband were very friendly. We totally
felt at home.
The property and home were well maintained, and we enjoyed outdoor time around a bon-fire that her husband so graciously put together for us.
I only wish our group could have had time to tour the farm."

Stayed with kids","Our family with 2 school aged kids and my dad thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Bill & Amanda's farm, and learned a few things about cattle farming (and caring for chickens or a very smart donkey named Midnight).. Amanda is the best host we've ever met, so thoughtful at every step of the way, including things you would not have expected to be offered (but some of which have been mentioned in other reviews). If you have kids and an ability to spend a night on their farm in the heart of Kentucky Bluegrass (so close to UK campus, Keeneland or the Red River Gorge area), do it, you will thank yourself and your kids will remember this experience for a long time!"

Group trip","Bill and Amanda truly have a gift for hospitality! They are the most accommodating Airbnb hosts we've ever stayed with, hands down! There are so many personal touches they put into our stay that we felt like we were going and staying with family. We arrived to a personalized note welcoming us with homemade cookies and banana bread baked from Grandma's recipe along with locally famous bottled drinks in the fridge which were tasty! Our daughter really wanted to do some farm work and Amanda was very flexible letting our daughter help feed the cows and chickens. Amanda and Bill also set up a game for our kids that had them make their own little poster board with their names splattered in paint on it. The farmhouse was very clean and well stocked and the beds we're comfortable. We picked this location because it is right in the middle of Noah's ark and Red River Gorge.
I cannot recommend Bill and Amanda's farmhouse highly enough!"

Stayed with kids","Our family had SUCH a great time at Franklin Ridge Farm! Amanda and Bill are super kind, generous and thoughtful hosts. Their home is clean, comfortable, (esp. the beds!), and stocked with everything we could possibly need. On top of that they provided so many special extras, such as fresh eggs & baked goods, snacks, and toys & games for our little ones. What made our stay MOST memorable was the way they took the time to show us all around their farm. The time we spent getting to ""help"" with the animals is something we will always remember,(kids & adults). We had hoped for nice accommodations while in town for a graduation, but we came away with so much more. If we ever make it back to KY I would definitely love to stay here again!! (judy)"

Group trip","I loved everything about this place! Amanda had left us a friendly welcome letter along with delicious refreshments and then came over to say hello. I’ve decided the best way to describe the home is like a hands-on museum for adults instead of children. History was everywhere, and Amanda had left notes of explanation all along the way. Want to play a game? The ones from my childhood were in the game cabinet. Want to play the piano? An old shape note hymnal is sitting there waiting for you. While the history is all around you, the modern conveniences are as well. I was pleasantly pleased to discover this farm home wasn’t far out in the country as I had anticipated but was very close to places to eat and shop. I would be glad to return someday!"

Group trip","5 Star AirBNB in my book! Do not pass by the chance to stay here! We had to book our stay the same day and Amanda was on top of things and communicated immediately. As soon as we got there, we felt at home and overwhelmed by how much Amanda went over the top to make us feel so. There were warm cookies waiting for us, fresh farm eggs, snacks, drinks in the fridge, a notecard on the table! That night, she brought us over fresh baked banana bread..the best we've ever had. We bottle fed the calves and Amanda took us for a tour of the farm on her Polaris...truly and adventure alongside of an amazing AirBnb stay. The house was clean, filled with lovely family history pieces to look at and had everything we needed. We slept well! Our only regret is that we could only stay one night! There's a great Italian restaurant close by and Winchester is a cool town to walk around in! There aren't many shops, but it was a great experience. It's about 1/2hr to hiking near Red River Gorge, and if I could do it over, I would choose to stay here and commute to the attractions over staying in Slade. Thanks again Amanda and Bill!"

Amanda does everything she can to make you feel at home. Some of the thoughtful gestures included home baked goods, fresh farm eggs, soft towels, and games and activities. The antiques and history are so interesting in the home, but the highlight was getting to see the farm and to feed the calves.

The house itself is quite spacious and comfortable. It has plenty of kid activities for both inside and outside. Definitely need to watch younger kids in the home as there are many breakable antiques, though that wasn’t too big a challenge.
Overall we had a great time here and would definitely return. We would recommend the farm to anyone who enjoys animals and especially travelers with kids."

Stayed a few nights","Amanda’s home was lovely! A preserved family home full of vintage items and antiques. Amanda was a wonderful host — very communicative prior to our arrival, had everything ready for check-in (including a “welcome table” with water and snacks. Way above and beyond!) Everything was clean, comfortable, and spacious (could easily sleep a group.) We loved having our morning coffee on the beautiful front porch and making breakfast in the well-stocked kitchen. It was an easy 20-30min to everything we wanted to do in Lexington."

Stayed a few nights","Our family of 4 stayed at Amanda’s place for a long weekend vacation, and it was fantastic. There are several rooms in the house to hang out in, so we had plenty of room to spend time together, and also to have space apart for downtime. The location was perfect for hiking at Natural Bridge State Park and visiting the zip line course at Boone Creek. There’s also a nice disc golf course right down the road.
The kitchen was fully equipped with everything we needed. Amanda provided incredible hospitality and amenities with a snack/breakfast stash including homemade banana bread, chocolate chip cookies, and farm-fresh eggs! The fridge was also stocked with a few different bottled drinks, including locally made soda Ale-8-1, a new fave.
Amanda was also incredibly generous to give us a tour of the farm and to introduce us to a baby calf that had been born just that morning! Amanda is very thoughtful and went the extra mile to add delightful and interesting touches to our stay.
All-in-all a great place to stay with a family, see the local attractions, and learn a little about farm life."

Stayed a few nights","Amanda and Bill are the most amazing hosts! The location is in the country, yet super close to town. We really enjoyed sitting outside in the evenings on both the front and back porches.
The personal touches they added made our stay that much better. The farm fresh eggs were incredible! We had them for breakfast every day! Not to mention the homemade cookies and bread! Beds were very comfortable and the bathrooms had every amenity you could need! The sheets and towels were so soft and fluffy!
We will certainly by staying with Amada and Bill anytime we are visiting in Winchester. Could not ask for better hosts!"

Group trip","My family needed to place to stay for my niece’s wedding in Paris, KY. It is a real working cow farm so there were cows and chickens! This was a great location in relation to Paris as it took us maybe 20 min to get to downtown Paris. It was also convenient for one of my sisters to meet us for the afternoon to visit and change clothes prior to the wedding. It was very clean and efficient. The hosts were close by not in the house. They were very hospitable with notes and refreshments (homemade cookies and fresh eggs from the chickens!). It is located in what felt like the country. That was okay for us. The only downside was a storm came through and the cable/internet was out. We didn’t necessarily need it but some of the men were sad not to able able to watch golf.
To it sum up… good location for our purposes. Very clean with white sheets/towels. We all got a good night’s sleep (3 beds) and super friendly/responsive hosts.
Would stay again if we needed to."

Stayed with kids","Amazing farm stay getaway from the city! Amanda greated us with warm, fresh-baked banana bread and cookies. Then so many more treats inside—fresh fruit assortment, hot cocoa, oatmeal, popcorn, cereal bars, assortment of herbal teas and keurig coffee options. Also, bottled water, juices, and my kids’ favorite, bottles of local sodas. On top of all of that, she left us over a dozen fresh eggs from her on-property chickens. We somehow ate ALL of those, and asked to buy some to take home. Amanda tried to just give us an entire flat, but we insisted she let us pay her. The kitchen is better stocked than mine at home. Just so many extra things you don’t typically get at airbnbs. We were out hiking, so missed the opportunity to ride along for evening chores, but our boys had a blast helping to feed the cattle in the morning. She had a little campfire built for us, but we were too tired after hiking to enjoy. The home was spacious, very clean, easy to find, and there is a lot to explore within. I wish we had stayed longer, but now we have a reason to come back! Highly recommend escaping the city and staying here."

Stayed over a week","What a great place to stay! My husband and a couple guys were working in the area for several weeks so we rented the farm house instead of a hotel. The property was easy to find and the views were amazing! Check in was super simple. Amanda responded immediately to answer any questions and provided LOTS of extras, which were greatly appreciated. She is very caring and so friendly and truly was the best host we have ever encountered. The house had everything the guys could have needed. The beds were comfy, the bedrooms were spacious, the kitchen was well stocked and there was plenty of room to park. The first day there was a problem with the coffee maker and as soon as it was mentioned Amanda went out and purchased a brand new Keurig and even purchased coffee for them for their troubles...now that’s what we’d call superb service. Amanda and her husband, Bill, are hosts that want their guests to feel like family and it showed!"

Stayed one night","The room is situated amongst other rooms in a old 1 level motel. The other rooms are occupied by full time residents. Inside the space, it smelled like smoke enough to offend a non-smoker’s nose. It was clean for the most part, but the bathroom sink had what looked like old spit in it and the bed was lacking a fitted sheet, only a mattress protector. In our opinion, we thought it was odd that a man offered to show us how to turn off lights, like another previous guest stated, without our request. The host should include that in all the instructions already printed out. Aside from that, it is pretty much what you would get out of a cheap hotel anywhere else."

Stayed a few nights","We didn't need anything at Brigitte's place except to shower and sleep. We were there to attend a weekend event several miles away. That said, it was MUCH more comfortable than staying in a hotel/motel. Although we didn't use the kitchen or laundry it was there should we have needed it. The full sized refrigerator was handy in that we could put our sodas/water in it overnight and refreeze our ice packs nightly. We also brought leftover (Impellizeri's) pizza with us from Louisville and had it for breakfast the following morning. We used the microwave to reheat pizza but probably should have used a skillet on the stovetop. Ain't hindsight great?
Sherry did turn on the TV for a while and it was nice to watch from a couch instead of sitting on a motel bed.
Even in high end hotels I can usually hear goings on outside. This place was extremely quiet.
So; was it a good choice. Overwhelmingly YES.
Thank you, Brigitte, for providing us a peaceful/quiet/nice place to crash for the weekend"

The wood rafters inside have character and history all to themselves. I loved the stay here, and each day I found another thing to love about this place. I would lease this as an apartment long term. Amazing."

There is pretty much nothing walkable from the apartment, unless you need a lawyer (close to the courthouse) or a woman's dress (several dress shops downtown, oddly). The downtown area could be awesome, lots of old buildings and history. Unfortunately, just not much going on downtown. We really just wanted a decent restaurant to be able to walk to. The apartment itself was great. If you have a reason to stay in Mount Sterling, I would definitely recommend this place."

You enter the guesthouse though a private patio around back. There is outdoor seating, a gas grill and a fire pit just steps away . (host provided wood and filled with kindling each day after use). Host also mowed paths in the back property for a leisurely stroll through the butterfly field. There is a butterfly identification guide in the guest book that you can take with you to help you identify what you find. There is also a bench in the field so you can just sit awhile if you wish. Now for the house, it was very nicely furnished, maintained and clean. The shower is huge and just beautiful. I can’t say enough about this property. This was our best stay yet!"

Very tasteful decorating, good quality furniture, hand painted watercolor pictures throughout, and a wonderful sleep number bed. The surroundings were so spacious and peaceful. We loved how they had walking paths mowed all around their back property so we could walk our dog and enjoy the fresh country air!"

The host was extremely accommodating, even allowing us to spend an extra night at the last minute😉 This place was clean and decorated so nicely with all the amenities you would need. The washer and dryer are a major plus, as well as the mowed trails you can walk through in the beautiful back yard. We enjoying grilling on the back patio as well. This is a must stay if you’re looking for privacy and relaxation. I would definitely stay here again in the future 🙂"

There are plenty of windows, so there is plenty of natural sun light. It is a very comfortable place to stay
for one night or one month.
The grounds around are very well cared for, and makes sitting on the patio very relaxing.

Stayed a few nights","The space was exceptionally clean and beautiful. It looked like it belonged in a magazine or could be a model home for a development. I never saw the hosts in person, but Jamie was fast to respond to any questions I had over Airbnb messaging. We had a perfect stay. The location is private and romantic. There are places outside to relax, a butterfly garden, and even paths cut into the acreage you can meander. Jamie has multiple paintings from a WV artist also decorating the walls, which are available for purchase- so, you can take some of Jamie's excellent taste home!
FYI- there are quiet hours from 10 pm during the week or 11 pm on weekends. Don't come here to party, this is a guest house on someone's property.
There is a full kitchen. You could absolutely cook your own meals. You could even make cookies. There is a washer and dryer. You could easily and happily live here with the thought and care that went into everything."

The nearest town is Winchester which has a few cute restaurants including a brewery and distillery. No wifi or cable so prepare to unwind and bring a good book!

Stayed a few nights","The host was incredibly responsive any time I had a question! The Airbnb is closer to their home than I had expected, but there are no windows facing the owner’s home, so it really feels like you have great privacy! They were so willing to share their land, so it is a great place to take your dog!
The owner remembered that I had mentioned we were traveling for my birthday and left a note saying happy birthday. So thoughtful!"

Stayed a few nights","This is an excellent place to go to really get away and leave the ""public"" for a bit. Perfect for 1 or 2 people (futon in living room such a great ""2nd bedroom"") to just relax and reboot.
We brought our own groceries to cook during our entire stay. But, various stores are no more than 15 or 20 minutes away. The kitchen has basic cookware - we easily were able to make full dinners.
We brought a wifi hotspot to catch up on some work and to use our Netflix. But, for rainy days, the dvd player works great - we brought movies we had not watched in years. The tv does not have cable, but it clearly has good reception of plenty of local channels, etc.
We walked the paths on the property with our dogs every day. We have two beagles and a herding mix - they LOVED sniffing every last inch of the property. We also found it easy to drive to Slade, KY to go to Red River Gorge area to hike. Plus, there's a great dog park in Lexington (Jacobson Park). It's a 30 minute drive, but it was worth it to let them run for a few hours.
All in all.. a great stay, and we would love to visit again. Perfect getaway for sure!"

Upon our arrival, the location, beautiful country landscape and amenities EXCEEDED our expectations!! During these trying times of the COVID-19 pandemic, my husband and I were a little skeptical to travel. The Escape gave us a much needed reason to getaway, the occasion having been our sons small wedding & reception (of course, practicing the COVID guidelines) gave us the unconditional excuse to venture out. The space was thoroughly Immaculate and the amenities were thoughtfully provided. We are so pleased, and so very thankful that our minds were rested on just enjoying our son & daughter in-laws celebration! We are truly grateful to Jamie & Steve for a spectacular welcoming & stay!!! Awesome host!!!
Thank you, Be well and God bless!!!
We Would MOST DEFINITELY come back to visit again!!!"

The host has thought of every little detail to make your stay perfect . We were shocked with the detail that was put into the space . Natural bridge state park is only like 20 min from there , we felt that we were close enough to everything thing else and at the end of the day hiking we had our own private oasis to come home to . Their place is very panoramic space with lots of birds and butterflies , The owner also has a beautiful butterfly garden that was very active . If your looking to hike natural bridge park , slade area , clay county area and others close by I think you can’t go wrong by staying here . They are Just a couple of miles from bluegrass highway which will take you to all the the sites you want to see."

Stayed with kids","To say Carol is thoughtful is an understatement. And I should also say the pictures do not do this home justice.
Had I stayed here before doing kitchen and bathroom renovations this past summer, I would have copied David and Carol’s selections. The home is absolutely beautiful. They have kept the historical charm while choosing updated appliances and features throughout. I joined my husband almost weekly on work trips pre-Covid, so I’ve stayed in a fair share of hotels and Air B&Bs. This is hands down the most pristine place I have ever stayed.
Anything one would need in a kitchen is provided. There are handmade coasters and extra blankets throughout the house. Extra plugs and charging stations in bedrooms, guides to local attractions, fresh flowers, homemade coffee cake, a welcome sign at the entry, and a hooded baby towel and baby bath for our toddler to use are just some of the thoughtful touches that greeted us. We had the pleasure of meeting Carol the morning we checked out, and she is an absolute delight. I could’ve chatted with her for hours!
Whether you’re coming to Mount Sterling or a neighboring city, you will be so happy you chose this rental. We can’t wait for our next stay!!!"

You could not go wrong by planning your stay here! And, if you're kind to the home, there could be some delicious home baked treats in store as well."

Many thanks to Carol and David for giving us so many wonderful memories to take with us on our new journey."

Stayed a few nights","We had a WONDERFUL stay 💜 The house was exactly as pictured (super clean, spacious for my bf and I, and peaceful- no noise, quiet area), and felt private (entire 1 story house to ourselves). To our suprise the house had a lot of personal touches (tons of hand crafted/sewn pieces and a beautiful painting that was local artist for sale). We also were greeted with sweet notes throughout (chalk board message welcoming us, homemade vegan coffee cake with a sweet note, and eggs with sweet note) and tons of local artisan stuff for us to use/try (free!)- soap, chocolate, local soda, and flower bouquet (smelled beautiful 💜). This location is also close to the Red River Gorge and Lexington (we love local breweries). Carol gaves us a LOT of suggestions for local breweries and restaurants, which was helpful (helped us save time on researching options). We had an amazing time and felt so welcome 💜💜 Thank you 💜💜 We will def come back and would recommend this place to others 💜💜"

I wish we could have stayed longer. Definitely interested in coming back to explore the Red River gorge area and other parks nearby. Highly recommend!

Stayed a few nights","This house was beautiful and absolutely perfect! It was recently remodeled with attention given to every detail. It felt as comfortable as home and was sparkling clean! The owner, Carol, is unbelievably thoughtful and went out of her way to make our stay better than we imagined it would be. You won’t find a better host, and you won’t want for anything here. We enjoyed all the homemade treats, local delights, personalized notes, suggestions on locations to visit, and how much time she spent preparing the house was for our arrival. We fell in love with Mount Sterling and cannot wait to visit again. As much as we selfishly want this to remain a well-kept secret, we highly recommend staying here. It will definitely exceed your expectations."

The beds were extremely comfortable. After a long day, coming “home” to water and local soda in the fridge, and local candy before bed was spectacular. We also found local coffee, eggs, and coffee cake for breakfast. Everything was perfection. We are trying to come up with excuses to return to Mt Sterling to return to our paradise."

Stayed one night","Hello, Dolly! This place is cute, fun, and quaint. The photos match the place perfectly on the inside. The bed is comfy, and the other rooms throughout the house were practical and clean; a place where a few people can really relax and spread out. I'd love to know the history of this little place. If only the walls could talk! It being tucked up in between a plaza and a grim funeral home made it tough to spot at first. The only thing it needs is a general sprucing up on the exterior. I love mapping small towns on my bike and on foot. My wife and I had a lovely stroll around the square of Mt. Sterling. The place is vibrant with one-off businesses, and it's loaded with history. I popped into the community arts center two doors down and was given an impromptu tour by two young staff. What a cool project for a rural town. I'd love to return sometime to hit up the bowling alley. Until then, Godspeed to Jordan and all those inhabiting and caring for a genuinely valuable USA town!"

Stayed a few nights","Stay in the Dolly Dumpster at your own risk. This Airbnb uses a traditional key. It is unsafe because other guests could have copied it. It was made of very thin aluminum and broke in the door. A handyman and locksmith finally got me in. But I did not have a key for the remaining day and a half of my stay. This meant I had to leave the door unlocked when leaving. I was told by the host, to take my personal items to my car when leaving. This did nothing for my personal safety.
Additionally, the house is run down and dirty. Very stained mattress. Yard is very tall. Junk at back door, broken chair , window screens. The glass in the front door is broken. Literal, duct tape on the ceiling holding light fixture in place.
The hosts were very unresponsive. House is next door to the funeral home which was convenient to me. I asked for early check in and never got a response. And, the owners delivered the key to me at 1:25 am on the day of check out. Airbnb should be ashamed for this."

It is so cute and cozy! The weather was colder than I’d planned, but there are so many blankets that I just shut the doors and nested up.

I hope the price point remains relatively the same bc I feel like it’s expensive enough for what it is and where it’s located. I’ve paid basically the same price for a bigger airbnb in Lexington, and there is way more competition in Lex. Overall, it was great and we’d visit again! We never communicated with Jordan, but Marc was responsive. I wld add Kleenex tissues (had none,) more towels for guests (only 2 bath towels 😳,) and since so many candles are left out for guests to use, a lighter would’ve been handy for us non smokers 😝 (we couldn’t utilize them!) Thanks for a fun place to stay for my 41st birthday! 🎉"

I was very excited to check out all of the places they recommended but unfortunately most all local places are closed on Sunday.

Night quieted for us but we did debate on whether to stay over the traffic. Seen reviews speaking of quiet but in our experience that’s the only negative. We didn’t use the kitchen or dining room the home is very old and has a lot of old features that’s been polished to look better. It was a neat stay for an overnight fun decorated place.

Pink is my favorite color, so I loved all of the pink all over the place. We loved listening to Dolly on the record player, and reading the back of the album with the Coat of Many Colors made me cry. The location was great as well--within walking distance from one of our favorite restaurants, Tomato & Flames."

Stayed one night","We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at ""The Dolly"" and were impressed with the whimsical homage to Ms. Parton in which the home is thematically decorated. As we were on our way, the hosts notified us that (very warm) day that their central air conditioning had malfunctioned, but they went out of their way to install a window unit in the bedroom so that we could have a comfortable night's sleep, which we did, and we appreciated their efforts. We loved hanging out on the front porch that evening, as well as our walk into and around the nearby town center. We'd fully recommend a stay here, especially if you're looking for a unique perspective."

Stayed with kids","This place is so cute. It’s really a hidden gem! Booked it on a whim and it was perfect. Convenient location to major retailers and food chains as well as a couple Amish markets, but the best part is this house is on a road surrounded by local businesses. So many cute little boutiques, antiques, and fun finds. There’s a restaurant within walking distance that features live bands.
The house sits off the street so it’s nice and quiet. It’s colorful and fun decor, that makes such a charming and cheery place to stay. We found the hosts were super responsive to our questions and were so polite. I did bring my kids- a 6 yr old and a toddler. The 6 yr old thought she was in a dream but the one year old kept going after all the treasures around the house so we had to put a lot of things up and away.
10/10 would recommend this house if you want a quiet get away to a small town with charm. It’s close to Winchester and Lexington, if you want a “bigger” night out. And 30-40 min to the RRG if you want to see some nature."

Spacious enough to bring our grandkids with us to visit our KY family, great yard area for family hangouts, kids, or for the dog to romp around. The horse fence is electric, so take caution along side the driveway area. And it's close to any adventures we're inclined to do.
Well stocked kitchen supplies to cook meals, comfortable living room and bed (we only used the master bedroom), and spacious dining area for family meals.
Riki the Barn Cat was great company on the front porch as well!"

The homes were exactly what we needed for a great trip and being able to make memories by staying together, versus separate hotel rooms, made that happen! Everything was clean, cozy and the space meet all of our needs. Robin went above and beyond by checking in several times to make sure we were comfortable. The scenery was gorgeous, relaxing and the horses that live just behind the home were friendly and greeted us along side of the driveway several times. We had a few special requests and Robin was very accommodating about each. The kitchen was well stocked, the beds were comfortable and toiletries were even available. The venue for our event was just a mile away, making it even more convenient. I highly recommend staying here on this peaceful country homestead!"

The ONLY constructive criticism I offer (and the only thing keeping this from being a 5-star review all around) is the mattress in the master bedroom. That desperately needs to be replaced. It was old and pretty uncomfortable. I would suggest mattress covers (under the bottom sheet) as well. The other two beds were great. That main one though definitely needs a new mattress!"

My daughter and I enjoyed the guided tour of the property provided by Axel the sweetheart German shepherd, interacting with the horses and chickens, and eating fresh raspberries from the garden. Highly recommend for anyone looking to reset and recenter away from city/people. Cindy was a very hospitable host and was on-hand to handle any of our needs."

Stayed a few nights","This was THE best place we've ever stayed for our little family reunion. We wanted some place off the beaten path and this place was perfect! Cindy made us feel at home and like family. We made several short trips to nearby attractions but honestly just enjoyed being at Cindy's place so much we ended up just staying there more than anticipated.
We loved waking up to the roosters and seeing the horses everyday. Axel, the German Shepard, was an amazing gentle giant. We left our GSDs at home and thoroughly enjoyed Axel. He literally took us on guided walks around the property.
Cindy was very warm and friendly and went out of her way to make us feel right at home.
In short we had a great time and really enjoyed this place. And honestly it is only a short drive to any of the attractions around like the Ark Encounter or the cave kayaking and Natural Bridge park."

Stayed with kids",The place itself is fine. I messed up the reservation and the cost increased considerably. The water was very cold in the shower. We used the sink. There are two small dogs that barked and growled at us but never came close enough to bite. The kitchen wasn’t the cleanest but the decor was cute in the place. The real issue was the feeling of being constantly watched. It was just very odd and I guess being in the barn her husband had to come up very often. It didn’t feel right and I don’t think I can use Airbnb again after it occurred.

The apartment was clean and as described in the listing, with anything we could have needed (except WiFi, as noted in the listing). Cindy was a wonderful host — even before we arrived she let me know that she had double checked that it would be warm enough for us (it was), and she offered many times to let her know if we needed anything else. I enjoyed reading the history of the farm and the area, and hope very much to be able to return for another visit!"

Very comfortable bed, little extras like cookies and farm fresh eggs, and the washer/dryer all made for a comfortable. I only occasionally heard a cow moo from the house (which didn't bother me at all), and seeing the calves barely 20 feet from the house was a good way to start and end the day. If you want to stay in a place that feels like someone's guest house (as opposed to a cheap flip that was only bought to use as a rental), this is your place."

The best part was the opportunity to visit with Amanda and her husband, Bill! They shared the history of their farm! Like many farms, theirs is unique, like most small family farms still in operation today.
They recommended driving to Red River Gorge, which was a super idea! We checked it out as we traveled the scenic Gorge and spent most of our day there enjoying every minute!
Will stay again if the opportunity to travel through the area presents itself!!
Nugget: Amanda’s banana bread is FABULOUS as well as her chocolate chip cookies!! NICE surprise!

Stayed one night","The Cozy Cottage was amazing and peaceful. It is just what it is in the description... cozy. Great place to stay for 1 or 2 people. The time taken to make sure your stay feels like home is unreal. One of the best I've been to when it comes to those touches Breakfast was provided, snacks, drinks, her baked goods that were her grandma's recipe, a personal card to welcome you into the cottage, etc. Check in was as easy as it gets and communication was never lacking. Bed was comfy and the environment super quiet and peaceful. I would recommend anyone stay here."

Stayed with kids","Bill and Amanda are a spectacular host and hostess. The property is very private but very conveniently located to many sites (Red River Gorge, Lexington, Frankfurt, ...etc.). They were very responsive with emails. Check-in was a breeze, as they were outside waiting for us. The guesthouse on the working farm is well-decorated with farm-style furniture from the past. Wi-fi was great. A/C was great. Beds were comfy. Shower was great. There were even some baked goods prepared for us on arrival. Very clean. They also went out of their way to show us around the farm on two occasions. Great hospitality and great memories for my son and I."
