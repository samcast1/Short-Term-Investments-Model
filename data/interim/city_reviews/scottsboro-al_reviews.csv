Stayed a few nights","We had a wonderful stay in Guntersville. The house was amazing and the location is perfect with easy access to the lake and surrounding stores and restaurants. I wish I could say the same for the fish and the weather, but we ended up with a couple monster catfish and some quality time on the water. I highly recommend this location."

The dock is well maintained and is perfect for keeping your boat tie up at and to sit out and relax. The city park landing is only a ten minute walk from the house if you want to keep your boat at the house and go get your vehicle at the landing. Cannot recommend this place enough!

The dock is so big and relaxing with chairs and rockers. It was wonderful to wake up and look out the kitchen windows at the glistening lake.
-The guest house has a keurig with coffee to choose from
-plenty of garbage bags
-washer and dryer with soap (we washed our dirty laundry so we wouldn’t have to worry with it when we got home)
-kitchen has dawn to wash dishes
-the beds were sooooo comfortable!

Getting up in the morning, watching the sunrise while sitting on the dock looking out over the lake, makes for an incredible way to enjoy a cup of coffee. She is quick to respond to any questions or information when needed. This is the second time I have stayed at the cottage, and intend to book it in the future if available. The accommodation provides all of the amenities needed for a relaxing stay. If you’re in the area...this is definitely a place that should be at the top of your list.

Stayed over a week","I stayed here almost a month, first fishing a tournament and then fun fishing the rest of the time. The location is superb, only minutes from the Scottsboro boat landing and close to anything else you want in Scottsboro. Quiet neighborhood, beautiful waterfront property. We took advantage of the large dock (great view!) to tie up the boat many evenings, but there is plenty of vehice and trailer parking area too. The small house was clean, well-maintained and had everything needed for a pleasant stay, including good Internet and TV, hot showers, and a washer and dryer. Joanna's communication was excellent - she responded quickly to questions and is a friendly person who cares about her guests. If you want a place to really enjoy all that Guntersville Lake and Scottsboro has to offer, I can highly recommend staying here."

My husband and I particularly enjoyed the full kitchen and dishes provided. There was a beautiful view of the lake, boat house and dock from nearly any angle in the space. There seems to be a family of otters that stays near the dock in the evenings, and I saw several of their cute faces swimming around. There are several shops nearby (gas stations, fast foods, piggly wiggly) so that you don't have to drive to far for the necessities should you wish not to. Overall, definitely a space I would recommend to my family and friends."

The views were absolutely beautiful. The lake was quiet and peaceful. The location is also super close to grocery stores and restaurants, 5-10 minutes max. There is a nice bonus to this place, which we really enjoyed too!"

The ONLY thing this place is missing is a fireplace or fire pit otherwise it’s pretty perfect.

Needs improvement: There was not enough furniture. For example, there needs to be an island or something in the kitchen, so we just moved the table from the dining room to the kitchen to have more work room. One of the bedrooms did not even have an end table, so we moved a chair in there. The lake was a marsh. Both swings were in very bad shape, could not use."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I stayed at David and Joyce's cabin while celebrating our anniversary. They've done an excellent job creating a comfortable, serene atmosphere. The area is very quiet and peaceful and the cabin was clean and well equipped. The bed we slept in was SO comfortable I didn't want to get out of it. The screened porch overlooking the water was perfect! We went during the winter months, but it seems to be built well and sealed so insects won't bother you while you enjoy the outdoor air. There's a fire pit and outdoor swing. You may be able to find fallen branches for firewood, but if not, there's a house at the beginning of the neighborhood that sells bundles of wood for $5. 10/10 would recommend this beautiful home to couples or a small group looking for a relaxing getaway.
The only ""con"" we noticed is you can't fish from the property because there are tall reeds. Other than that, it's perfect!
Thank y'all for sharing your home! We look forward to a stay again in the future!"

Although the weather turned cold on us and we were not able to spend time out on the screened-in porch (the gem of this place), we could still enjoy the beauty outside by looking out through the double sliding glass doors. It is a great place to relax, but there is plenty to do in the area. David provided the right amount of communication, checked-in on us to make sure everything was going well, and was available should anything be needed. We highly recommend this place, as well as David and Joyce as hosts, and will consider again when back in the area."

Stayed a few nights","Our getaway to Getaway Cay was just what we needed to get away!!! The cabin sits on the downward slope of the hill. there is limited traffic and the neighboring houses are blocked by trees. The view is to a quiet cove of Lake Guntersville. It's between Guntersville and Scottsboro, so easy access to nearby restaurants and shopping in either town. The pictures are exactly what to expect - they just don't do justice to the peace and tranquility around - where the only sounds are nature.
This is a new venture for them and there is currently not a washer/dryer in the home - which was totally fine for me, I had no intentions of doing ""normal"" housework! There are hook-ups, so it may be in the works. There also appeared to be an electric smoker on site, but we didn't use it.
My only suggestion for out of town guests (which has nothing to do with David or Joyce or anything in their control) is pick up your own water and ice. We are definitely not accustomed to the water in the area."

All was well-stocked and charmingly decorated. The hosts made us feel at home and were very responsive. Went to the state park to swim and you must try the brand new Pizza Ed in the town of Guntersville. Some say its the best pizza in AL. All around, a great place to relax and to venture out for a lake getaway. --DJD"

Inside, there is plenty of seating in the living room. The four bedrooms were comfortable and each one had its own TV. Both bathrooms have hotel style dispensers in the shower filled with shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel.
The kitchen was well stocked with dishes, silverware, and pots/pans. Walmart and Publix are very close for groceries. There are also restaurants nearby."

We immediately felt at home and welcomed, we loved our stay and would highly recommended a stay at Jose lovely home thats nestled in the trees, very peaceful. We also found Scottsboro very welcoming and easy to navigate. We loved KC's BBQ at the Marina, best Brisket we have ever had!!. Also, try 50 Taters for the best Southern Home cooked food around!!. If you love Wildlife, Water and Trees, this beautiful city has it in spades!!!. This is truly a Fishermans or Womans Paradise and this house is close to everything."

He also lived close by which gave us peace of mind if anything was to go wrong. There was a friendly puppy that lived next door that greeted us upon arrive then went back home. So adorable! The neighborhood was busy but not wasn’t down our street. It was quiet and I felt safe. If we ever come back for fishing we will definitely want to stay here again. This cozy place definitely made our stay amazing!"

Stayed a few nights","The host gets five stars and furniture was extremely nice and comfortable but, steps going up to bed, bath, etc. were extremely deep steps with no handrail. The kitchen had no way to cook anything except for a small toaster oven. There were no pots, pans, etc. there is grill outside upstairs and a very small microwave downstairs. I went and purchased a hot plate so I could cook breakfast. You couldn’t stay more than a couple of nights because the refrigerator/freezer is extremely small. You couldn’t store a bag of ice in the freezer part. Host might consider buying a two burner hot plate and pots and pans upstairs, installing handrails, and possibly putting a larger refrigerator downstairs while keeping the small one upstairs. Again, the host definitely deserves a five star rating! He was responsive and very flexible with our check-in, and any other requests. Location is great, convenient to boat ramps, and has a covered place for our boat with electrical."

The covered/attached carport/boatport was great to park the boat under for a heavy overnight rainstorm. The private/locked boat ramp was much better than expected. Very well taken care of and zero traffic from other boaters. Guntersville ramps can be very busy any day of the week and the private ramp made our stay so much easier than it could have been. 5 stars from us and we look forward to staying here again."

We loved waking up to the views each morning and will definitely book with Paul again if we are ever in the area.

The path down to the dock could use some work and it is on a pretty big hill, so keep that in mind if you're going to spend lots of time on the dock as we did. The dock is awesome, but could also use a little TLC. Don't plan to swim from the dock as there is lots of seaweed. But great for fishing and kayaking from. Loved the quiet neighborhood the house is in, perfect for long walks. Paul is super responsive."

Location was great and plenty of windows in the house to enjoy the view!
There was also loads of common space with ample seating so if you do have a big group there is plenty of space to gather.
The house was also surprisingly quiet! If you were in one area of thw house, it was difficult to hear any noise from other parts of the house which is perfect when you have some who are early to bed and others who like to stay up and socialize.
Lastly, since it is a lake stay, i have to mention the fishing lol
We like to fish but we are just worm/bobber kinda people who fish entirely for fun. We caught plenty of fish off the dock (mostly little ones bc of our hook/bait combos)! We even had a total novice in our group who caught a fish. Great place for experienced fishermen as well as novices or little ones.
We had a very nice relaxing week here! :)"

This is the 5th year that we’ve been down to Guntersville at the first of February and have stayed at AirBNb’s every time. This was the best place that we’ve stayed so far. Traditionally the fishing has been awesome this year not so much. Regardless the house was great. We parked two bass boats in the driveway and could have easily parked three possibly even four. There was an outlet nearby to charge the boats (75’ extension cord). The sunrise off the dock and back porch was awesome!"

Group trip","Paul was very responsive to my texts. The house is big, we had plenty of space. The kitchen was well stocked with dished and there were plenty of towels and wash cloths. It was 90 plus degrees out and the air conditioning on the main level would not keep up. It was 78 degrees most of the time. The lower level and the upper level keep cooler. The drive way and the path to the water was loose rock and it was difficult to walk down without feeling like you were going to fall. The landscape and grass were overgrown and needed cut also. This is not a place to plan to hang out in the water to swim or
sun bathe. The water around is full of grass and weeds. Good for fishing I hear, but be had to go out in the main lake to swim. Overall we still had a good time, but we would not have picked this place of we had known about the water conditions."

Sunsets were amazing over the water."

Group trip","Paul’s lake house is very spacious and comfortable. We had 12 people in our group and there was plenty of room to all spread out at all times. The sunsets and sunrises are beautiful on the water. It is peaceful and quiet and a very nice and safe location. The house is very close to a grocery store, restaurants, Starbucks and other stores! The boathouse was great to have to keep our bass boat out of the rain while tied to the dock. The pool table and shuffle board table are very nice and there are a lot of TVs with great channels and viewing options. The kitchen is well appointed and there are a lot of misc extra supplies everywhere in the house like garbage bags, bandaids, soaps, spices, etc.
Paul was very quick to respond for any questions, help etc.
Overall I recommend this rental and hope to get a chance to stay here again!"

Group trip","Our stay was excellent! Paul and Heather were amazing hosts and very attentive. They got back with me in a timely manner any time I had a question. Couldn’t have asked for better host.
The house!!! The house was amazing. It’s huge! We were not cramped at all. It was very well stocked with everything you
Could possibly need. Dishes galore, stock pot, crock pot, utensils, coffee pots, plenty of storage for your own food in the kitchen. The kitchen had it all! The living room had lots of seating for the whole family. The family room had more living room seating with tv, another dining table (or game table), pool table, shuffle board and a bar area. Bathrooms came fully stocked with towels (so many towels you won’t run out), hand soap and toilet paper. Bedrooms had all the linens and every room had a tv with every streaming service available. There were cleaning supplies available for us to use. TWO sets of washer/dryer units to keep up with laundry. Wi-Fi was great with a strong connection. Cell phone signal was also great. Boat dock had plenty of room for several boats and plenty of space to bring chairs down for everyone. The screened in porch was also amazing to hang out on. Lots of patio furniture to sit on. We didn’t use the grill but it was available. Boat launch was literally in the neighborhood. Lake views from the house were beautiful. Lake access in the back yard. We will definitely return to Paul and Heathers amazing home.
You won’t be disappointed, for sure! Thank you guys for the wonderful week. We were not ready to come back to Ohio! See y’all again soon!"

Good communication w owner. Very prompt in his responses. We made good use of the pool table all week. Good location, close to grocery, places to eat. Only bummer for us was that the littles weren’t able to swim off the pier because the water was a little yucky, but I know Guntersville Lake is like that in places at different times of the year. Definitely would rent again!"

Just down the road from stores, food, gas, etc. And yet it did feel secluded. Tv also had multiple streaming services which is a nice touch. I felt like we got a week’s worth of rest in 2.5 days.

The bedrooms were clean, and bathrooms were equipped with toiletries! Even the kitchen had stuff for dishwashing and garbage bags. So grateful to have found this place. Just. A few minutes from a free local park with a splash pad, minutes from a Walmart and a few eateries. We attended a wedding on a huge lake while there and it was only 8 minutes away which was perfect.

Group trip","This place was really nice and clean. The pool had leaves in it i guess because its cold they didn't take them out because they thought people wouldn't use it. One of the bedrooms in is the basement with no bathroom. The room with the single bed is thru the master bedroom which is also connected to one of the bathrooms bring ya own soap because he provided hotel size soap. One of the bedrooms in the basement it is really big and can hold a couple air mattresses if u needed to use them. The back door in the kitchen that leads to the pool/backyard does have stairs. My only negative was that I cleaned up really good and I still received a message that I didn't so my only thing to other renters would be to take a video when u leave so u have proof that you didn't leave it the way the ""cleaning crew"" said u did"

Stayed a few nights","As others have said the photos don't do this home justice. It's one of the cleanest places we have stayed. The appliances are all brand new. Couches and beds are super comfortable and the AC is amazing. I did save the best for the last....The Pool!!!! The backyard is huge and the pool is perfect. We loved that our pups were able to run around the perfectly manicured grass in a fenced in yard while we swam. We spent an entire day in and around the pool, the grill was great for our steaks. The basement was an added bonus! We hope to return!"

Shane also provided extras like cooking utensils, paper towels, hand soap, extra towels etc. Making the space super functional for the family! The downstairs space with a tv was great for the kids while the adults could relax upstairs. Thanks again Shane!"

There was plenty of nice seating in the pool area and the pool was very clean and well maintained. Shane responded quickly and thoroughly to any questions we had. The only item to note, is that there are stairs to get down to the pool. Not a negative, just a note for future renters. We would love to stay again. Home, hospitality and pool were all top notch!

Group trip","Beautiful home. Beautiful Layout. Great location. Needs more attention to detail (decorations and cleaning).
Could be cleaner.
One door loose on garbage cabinet in kitchen (offered to come fix over the weekend. we were leaving on Sat morn. they were already off when we arrived. very aggravating since we used it a lot)
One loose drawer in kitchen
Lots of cobwebs
No dish detergent in kitchen
No furniture in bedrooms besides beds, except two little tables beside the beds. (no chest of drawers, no dressers)
Door knobs to the outside very complicated
Walls need painting or touched up. lots of scrapes on the walls
Overall this place would definitely be worth the money if it had good cleaning, painting, and cabinets fixed, more furniture in the bedrooms. Attention to detail!! Dish detergent, Kleenex in bathroom, a few decorations."

Stayed a few nights","We had a getaway with my sister and her husband. There was plenty of room for the 4 of us. The bedding and linens were very comfy. The view of the lake is lovely. We had takeout from KC’s by the lake that was very good. The whole house, inside and out, was navigable for my disabled husband. However, the house needs some attention - deep clean, paint refreshing throughout, cobwebs on lighting fixtures and fan, grimy windows which look out onto the lake, stained coverlets and towels, doorknobs on doors that are very loose, kitchen drawers that drop down when you open them. The upholstery on porch furniture was stained and the porch needed to be swept. Be advised you’ll need to bring shampoo, conditioner and shower gel. (As a co owner of an air bnb myself, I found this to be rather stingy for the price we paid.) I had high hopes for this getaway. Just didn’t deliver."

Would suggest a few more items to stock kitchen. Not a problem for us because we were only there for a short trip passing through and ate out at local restaurants that we enjoyed. We loved the covered boat house deck and all loved swimming in the lake to cool off and relax for a day. A little repair needed to the walk way to the boathouse, but I’m sure the lake weather is hard on everything. Very easy to check in. We arrived a little later than expected due to car issues, but were able to get our vehicle into a local shop (Carter Automotive) and have never had such wonderful service. They got us in immediately and solved our issue easily. Neighbor was also very nice and offered his assistance. Would definitely come back and would love to explore this beautiful community more."

Group trip","Beautiful, peaceful, memory maker vacation! The house is just as pictured. We had a wonderful time fishing from the boat house deck and kayaking. Communication with the owner was fantastic. Super quick responses and he made sure we had everything we needed before arrival. Great WiFi so I could work remote some and the teens could steam their shows. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook a couple nights. Highly recommend Joe’s pizza and Toro’s Mexican cantina but do not recommend The Docks (although great location on the water, service was slow (waited over an hour after we ordered) and the food was nothing special yet pricey. Now back to the house review - yes, you should go, book now! It was amazing and so relaxing and peaceful. We loved everything about it."

The house is right off the highway so it’s very convenient to town and the marinas but it is also a little loud if you want to take your coffee on the porch. Down by the lake is peaceful and serene with great views.

It’s an easy stroll down to the boat house where there is plenty of covered and open space to congregate and enjoy hanging out and playing in the lake or watching the rain come in and enjoying the nice breeze. The cove where the house is tucked into is plenty large enough to play around on kayaks or jet skis and not be on the rougher main lake area with other lake traffic. As the owner, Thomas was super to deal with! He was very quick to respond and if any issue arose, he was very quick to take care of fixing it. He was extremely accommodating and was very invested in making our time there as enjoyable as we had hoped. I would absolutely rent this property again and hope to again in the future!"

Enjoyed being only a mile from the boat ramp and having use of one slip in the boat house was a huge plus. Thomas as a host will go the extra mile to ensure his clients are happy and satisfied.

We had a family event and it was fantastic. The dock has some parts that need repaired but kids just made sure they were careful. The only bad part was it rained all day on saturday and although we tried not to park on the shared driveway, we had about 10 vehicles and visitors in and out so much , we tracked clay on the porches and driveway and that was an issue. So future visitors please do your best to not get the porches or driveways muddy! Thomas was a wonderful host and communicated well with me. We will definitely stay again! Gorgeous property and neighbors are great!"

The boat house was great for playing in the water and watching the sunset. The water is quiet and peaceful and perfect for kayaking and swimming. We had such a wonderful time in this home and would definitely stay here again!

Thomas communicated very quickly with all of my questions. Will definitely stay here again.

The homeowners was very nice and was very responsive if we needed anything. The neighborhood was very quite and laid back.

It is clear that Ashtin has tried to think of everything. She is also proactive and called us in advance about an apparent issue that cropped up and what she did about it.
Check in is easy and you are presented in a notebook with clear laminated instructions about everything.
Just remember it is a ""tiny"" house and any issues that would arise in any such dwelling should not be perceived as negatives. It is a great value for the price for short 2 night stay.

The host was very friendly, and she asked early on in the stay if there was anything I needed to let her know right away. There was nothing that needed attention though.

The place was beautiful and very well thought out. There were tons of books and games and a smart TV. The beds were very comfortable as well. And the pillows were nice. That's my biggest pet peeve about some places are old pillows, but they were fresh and fluffy and spotless at Brianna's. The only thing I want to point out for future guests is if you have a very large husband, he might not fit in the shower. I don't want to say this as a negative, because this is a very nice Airbnb, but as someone with a large husband who wasn't with me, I know he would have not fit, and would have wanted to know that ahead of time. That aside, though this is in a great neighborhood, it feels very private, has tons of space, is clean and comfortable, parking was easy, and I highly recommend!!"

I'm coming back to Scottsboro in the future, and this is where I plan on staying. This place is the best."

We live on a lake in Minnesota and have the same vibe happening in our home (the view here is much better) It was a much needed stop after hotels on our way down and have a taste of home. We had a dog visit while our son was on the dock fishing and he was such a honey and a welcomed surprise. The only thing that would make this experience any better would be for it to have a fire pit and/ or hot tub. It was absolutely fantastic! Thank you for hosting!

And Mrs. Jeana takes good care of you while you are there and is happy to help you find your way around and point you to local attractions and such.
It’s just a great place to get away for some quiet time for yourself, for working out of town or to travel with the family since there are all kinds of outdoor adventure type stuff to see and do that are fun for all ages. And the price is more than fair. I WILL be staying here again for sure. Highly recommend!!!"

Cons: A few things that we notice when we stayed there was there were VERY many flies in the room. (Luckily, it didn’t buzz.) That was a bit shocking seeing so many flies within the room. Also, there was a slight odor within the room.
Overall, a very simple, quick and easy place to crash for a night. We didn’t get to meet the host personally."

She also fell in love with the bulldogs.
Bonus: whether you like a hot shower or a cold shower, you’re covered. The hot water is hot and the cold water is cold. Exactly what you need after some wearisome traveling."

Stayed one night","The room was exactly like the picture. Jeanna is a fun, warm, and welcoming host who provided a relaxed atmosphere for her guests. I wish I could have explored the surrounding area and chatted with Jeanna and the other guests longer, but I had a 7 hour drive ahead of me. But if I ever find myself in northeast Alabama again I'll definitely be stopping at her place."

Group trip","This place was a wonderful home base for a weekend of hiking in Northern Alabama. The neighborhood was peaceful and private but still close to town. The place was spacious, clean, and comfortable.
There were a few minor things to note, none of which cause significant issue:
* Oven temperature was way off
* Sliding Glass Door to the back patio was very hard to open and close
* Fridge Door opened on the wrong side
Overall we had a great time and would highly recommend."

Stayed a few nights","Our recent stay in Scottsboro, AL, was simply delightful! This charming Airbnb truly felt like our ""home away from home.""
The home itself was a gem – spotlessly clean and thoughtfully decorated. While there were three bedrooms to choose from, we couldn't resist the allure of the master bedroom, where we enjoyed the coziest and most restful sleep. The attention to detail in every room made us feel like we were staying in a boutique hotel, with all the comforts of home.
The neighborhood was peaceful, and we always felt safe. It's conveniently located, and the home looked exactly as it does in the photos.
In short, if you're looking for a wonderful Airbnb experience in Scottsboro, look no further. We wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking a warm and welcoming home away from home. This place is a true gem, and we can't wait to return!

Carol was very helpful in pointing out things to do while in the area before we even reserved. We went for a relaxing vacation with another couple to just hang out and play games. We were not disappointed. There were lots of game choices and a nice dining room table to play on. The location was pretty centralized to restaurants and nature exploring. I would recommend Carol's place for any length of stay and look forward to staying here again.

I would highly recommend their place for your fishing trip as it is only 10 minute drive to Goose Pond Colony which is where we typically launch. The house is also very conveniently located to restaurants, gas and other conveniences (3-5 minutes). I definitely plan to stay here again in the future.
