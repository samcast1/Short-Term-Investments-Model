Stayed a few nights","Quiet neighborhood, kinda walkable. This met our needs for our weekend visit to Barber Motorsports, only 25 minutes away. We’d prefer more privacy, but enjoyed the clean space, full kitchen, and hot showers. Jacob was very responsive, although we had everything we needed. GPS does not take you to building, so follow Jacob’s directions. Excellent option, and within our budget."

Stayed a few nights","As a young introverted woman, I appreciated Jacob’s approach - no fluff and clear instructions. He left me alone unless I reached out. And when I did reach out , he was responsive and helpful!
Now for the place, it was spotless, which I always appreciate. Neighbors were quiet and the neighborhood was pleasant and clean. Great location.
If I return to Birmingham Ill definitely see if this place is available again!"

Stayed about a week","A wonderful place to stay. Jacob has done an amazing job decorating and caring for this charming apartment, in a single brick house converted into a couple BNB’s. The neighborhood is quiet, hilly, with charming houses among large trees, providing a home-like feeling. Inside, the many windows brighten everything, the wood floors are beautiful, white paint and trim add to the bright, airy feeling. All the accoutrements and utensils are well chosen, from the kitchen to the bathroom. There’s a wonderful six burner gas stove, a dishwasher, and a washer and drier all in the kitchen. The bed is awesome, with great sheets and pillows, and a desk, where I'm working now, that is beautiful with a chair that fits perfectly. Everything is also incredibly clean! Everything outstanding. It's one of the best places I've ever stayed, and I've traveled a lot. I will definitely return to this charming home-away-from-home the next time I am in Birmingham. Thank you, Jacob!"

Stayed over a week","Jacob’s place was good overall for the time of my stay.
He was not completely honest in his listing about the parking location, which ended up being on the street by the curb along the listed apartment, with him telling me of this on the day of my check in. I also had a bit of trouble trying to check in because the lock instructions were not clear, and had to figure it out in the cold ~30 degree rainy weather.
Upon entrance, there was a noticeable pet smell, dusty air vents, and the couch had pet hair. The bedroom shares a wall and closet with one of the other units, so I never actually felt alone or had any quiet time because everything can be heard, including the pets barking, walking, and yelping just in the room next to yours, so a noise machine would be advisable.
Overall, you get what you paid for. The kitchen was well stocked, and it is a cute, small apartment for a comfortable stay after cleaning it up and getting some noise machines set up."

Stayed a few nights","We loved staying at Jacobs apartment. It was in a wonderful location with kind neighbors (especially those across the street). The neighborhood is extremely safe, friendly and walkable. We went on an evening stroll with my three month old and felt completely safe. You are located minutes away from cute coffee shops and restaurants in Avondale. Saturday there was a farmers market right by The Red Cat coffee shop. We booked last minute and Jacob was extremely understanding when we had a situation come up where we thought we were unable to come. He also responds nearly immediately which I so appreciate.
Contrary to the listing the apartment is NOT upstairs. I missed it on the listing and was worried because my father has bad knees. It is the apartment just below the stairs. It was clean and hit all of our necessities. We'll be staying again when we come to Birmingham."

Stayed a few nights","A+++. Wonderful place, wonderful stay, and very accommodating and responsive host. The interior design and comfort of this place for two is outstanding. Josh had the place set up with plenty of amenities. A great place if you just want to chill or if you want to walk around and sample some great restaurants. We went to a concert at the BJCC and it was such a nice day we walked from the place to and back. The parking is very easy, as is access, comfort and safety. Highly recommend if you’re staying In Birmingham! Loved it!"

Stayed a few nights","Superb Airbnb stay. This place had every possible thing you could need (washer/dryer, dishwasher, hand-held vac, lint roller, etc.), plus lots of little extras (snacks, an honor-system bar, chocolate!). The space is modern, clean, and spacious and I fell in love with the area-- especially the amazing Sloss Furnace National Historic Landmark. Josh was responsive and kind when I had some user-error getting in (the # comes BEFORE the entry code! :). It was the best all-around Airbnb stay I've had in over a decade. I wish there were more true gems like this one."

They’ve created magic in an Airbnb and thought about their guests in every way imaginable. Stop looking. This is the one for you!"

Stayed a few nights","I am from Birmingham, I lived there my whole life until about 8 years ago when I moved to Bay Minette, Alabama. My mom and dad still live in Birmingham so I come home quite often. Usually I stay at an Air BnB in McCalla because I bring my furbabies sometimes.But this trip the wife and I decided we wanted to have a “kid free” weekend 🤣😂 so I have always wanted to show her the beauty of Birmingham, ESPECIALLY at night with all the lights and I scrolled across this lovely loft. I was amazed at the price and booked it immediately. Josh was very quick to send me a very friendly and welcoming message and also made sure I knew how to get in and everything. He was very prompt in his responses no matter what I bothered him with and the loft itself is IMMACULATE!! It is BY FAR my most favorite place to stay when I come home
without the furbabies and I look forward to staying here in the future. 10 out of 10 💯💯💯 I would recommend this beautiful loft to ANYONE that is planning on visiting."

It is conveniently located near the best restaurants and activities! A lot are within walking distance & you can save so much money getting around all while sight seeing, having a great time, eating and drinking good! As soon as I opened the door, I immediately felt the self-care space of peace I needed! Josh & Dominic are the best host! I’ve never stayed somewhere that was beautiful, comfortable & convenient all on the inside and also had all inclusive options (minus the full course meals lol) of snacks, cooking utensils, supplies like seasonings, coffee, tea, laundry unit & supplies, games, a nice little bar… the list can go on & on! It’s perfect for solo self care time & I also recommend this spot for intimate quality time for couples or good friends!
I can’t wait to come back!!!"

Stayed a few nights","HISTORIC LOFT IN DOWNTOWN BHAM WITH COBBLESTONE STREETS AND TRAINS.
This place is a pure treasure! There's truly nothing like a stay that's loaded with history. The loft also felt much bigger than I imagined. Included with this unit ~large secure-well lit parking lot right behind the building.....you can see your vehicle from the loft windows. Upon check in~there's a key provided for front & back door of the actual building. Convenient elevator to Josh's Loft. Clean, well equipped, coffee, sugar, cold creamer, great linens and high end glassware. Josh has a chalkboard on the wall with a list of restaurants, bars, places of interest. I feel this area is revitalizing and safe. You can't go wrong here....500+ ""five star ratings"" says it all. OMGosh I LOVED the trains! Thanks for hosting us Josh."

Impressed with the decor and the amenities. Ever my detail was really taken care of ..even unexpected details. Such as multiple places to charge devices .. an honor bar (an amazing addition )… welcome chocolates and snacks .. coffee pods .. the roll down room divider..perfect blockout curtains … nightlights … a great board with recommendations for sightseeing and restaurants …everything was so well placed and thoughtfully curated . The area is great and so walkable . The checkout process was equally descriptive and easy to follow . If we come back to the area we will stay here and we will recommend it to others as well."

Although we didn’t spend much time there, we definitely enjoyed our stay. Everything was incredibly clean and I felt super comfy and at home. I’m used to living next to a train so that was not an issue at all, but I liked that there was a noise-maker to help with that. It felt homey and peaceful, and they truly thought of everything. I loved every extra detail and care taken to help guests enjoy their stay. The check-in description and pictures were helpful and we got in and out with ease. If I ever need to book a stay in Birmingham again, this is what I’ll choose!"

Another great feature was how they provided a list of recommended restaurants, bars and other entertainment. The area is downtown and we were there during the weekend where it can be very lively outside into the late evening but because the apartment building is located a building behind the main street, it provided privacy and seclusion from the noise.
Josh was also super responsive and helpful. We look forward to staying here again."

I had a bit of trouble getting in, but as it turned out that was entirely my fault (I tried to use the key pad on the front door of the building instead of the call box to the right, as the very thorough instructions had indicated). I called Josh and he immediately got me straightened out and he was otherwise very responsive. Others have commented on the nearby train; I am a very light sleeper and wasn’t bothered at all so don’t let this deter you. I would definitely recommend this place; probably the best AirBnB I have stayed in."

Stayed a few nights","Words won't do this wonderful historic loft justice and we would have to say it is one of the best AirBnB's we have stayed in around the world. Prime location with free parking, great blackout curtains, a very comfy bed and all the little touches add to the charm. We didn't need to use the white noise machine as we have lived near train tracks before. We found the trains to be a non-issue and hardly noticed them passing. The communication and checkin procedures were the most detailed, which takes any stress out of arriving. Would definitely recommend, and if we ever venture back to Birmingham we would be booking it again.
Birmingham is absolutely charming, and the loft is the perfect spot to call home base while you explore the city!"

Stayed a few nights","This was probably one of the best AirBnBs I’ve ever stayed at. Booked for Furnace Fest 2022 (A lot of AirBnB’s got cancelled for Furnace Fest attendees a few days before the festival but this one did not cancel on me!) The studio was adorable, the bed was so comfie! They have a BAR in the studio (yes a BAR with alcohol and mixers and sodas!,) Keurig coffee maker with pods and sugar and creamer, brita water container and extra water bottles, snacks! They supply almost everything you need in the bathroom (even toothbrushes and loofahs!) The white noise maker made me sleep so good (can’t even hear the train with it on or even without it on.) The studio was so close to Sloss Furnaces, we could walk to the festival. Tons of cute little bars and restaurants to walk to. Quiet safe little part of town and you get a free pas to the parking lot next door but it’s only $4 a day so that was cool for extra vehicle. The only downfall is it’s already booked for Furnace Fest 2023!"

I would ABSOLUTELY stay there again. The host even let me keep my bag there until much later in the day so I could enjoy Birmingham without lugging it around.

Literally everything - from the actual studio space which was absolutely lovely, to the detailed directions/instructions and local recommendations provided by Josh + Dominic (not to mention, the charming extra touches/treats left for us, which made it feel like a luxurious hotel stay) - was perfect. The loft is conveniently located in the heart of historic downtown Bham and within walking distance of the main city hub (and just a quick 10 min Uber ride to Mountain Brook, where my partner and I attended a wedding). The building is super safe/private/secure and even includes a gated parking lot, which was a godsend. I cannot rave enough about the hosts, Josh and Dominic- Communication was excellent (they responded within minutes to any questions we had), and they are literally the consummate hosts- We encountered a travel mishap on the morning we were checking out, and they couldn’t have been more gracious, helpful and understanding. If I could give our experience + the hosts a million stars, I would. Can’t recommend this place enough!"

Parking is fairly easy and plenty of space to choose from."

Stayed a few nights","This place was so nice, super clean, bed was so comfortable, they have a ""honor bar"" inside with alcohol and mixers ready to go. As I'm sure most of you are aware, this is located next to the train tracks. I'm personally a light sleeper and didn't know it ran multiple times during the night. They have a white noise machine and double pane windows which pretty much blocks out all noise. But like I said, I'm a very light sleeper and it just didn't work."

It was easy to find. The location felt secure and safe. It was exactly as pictured, and was super clean with lots of natural light and plenty of space. We specifically chose it for the king bed and we were not disappointed. The memory foam mattress and light, cozy duvet made our stay SO comfortable.
We ate dinner at the Outback Steakhouse on the next block over, and then walked the half mile to the Alabama Theater for a show. We felt perfectly safe walking back even at 10:30pm. It's a well lit, well maintained area.
We had everything we needed for a fabulous stay. Did I mention the bed was super comfortable? And our host checked in with us on the app to make sure everything was ok, so I felt like if we had needed anything he was ready to help.
Next time we need a place to stay in Birmingham, I won't even need to look at other options - this is our place!"

Sadly I lost my vehicle in a tornado that hit PCB in January. So I made this an opportunity to take a mini vacation. I had always wanted to visit Birmingham so made the best of it. I had never been so was not sure where exactly to go, I just knew I didn't want to be right downtown. I am so glad I chose this spot! I will be back!!
The Unit was larger than I expected. Even though the property grounds is shared with several other units it felt very private. Parking was easy on the street right in front of the property. Neighborhood felt safe for me to walk around. Highland park was just blocks away. Loved walking the neighborhood with my Koda each morning.
We took a short trip to the Oak Mountain State Park which was so beautiful. I am looking forward to coming back down in late summer/fall!"

The place was super cute with great personal touches and nice products for us to use, including some nice snacks and beverages. It was unusually cold in Birmingham when we stayed and we were cold inside the home since the heating was taking time given the rareness of below freezing weather. Emma was kind enough to give us their best heater and was checking in with us to see if we were ok, which was much appreciated.
The area is residential and quiet with parks around and it was quite pleasant. We rested well given the peacefulness and the amazingly comfortable bed. Thanks so much to the hostesses!"

Stayed a few nights","This is by far one of the best Airbnb stays I've ever had. I think I said out loud to myself several times ""is this real?"" For the price and location, I kept expecting there to be a catch. Everything just felt so comfortable. I was in town for a sad occasion, so the amenities and comfort really helped ease things for me. The shower was spacious and modern, and the entire bathroom was well appointed. I wasn't awake in the living space for long, but it was always a peaceful place to come back to and had everything I needed, and more. I really appreciated the snacks and tea. Getting in late after a full day of flying was exhausting, so I definitely needed those. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable, and there was plenty of space in the bedroom to move around. I come back to B'ham to see family and friends fairly often, so I really hope to stay here again. Felt like home away from home. Thanks for everything!"

Stayed with kids","We just finished a year of traveling through four different countries in Europe and Central America, and have stayed in so many amazing airbnbs - but this was by far our FAVORITE STAY! Our son didn’t want to leave! It is so antiquated and cozy (the entire house has so much charm) close proximity to stores and parks! The outdoor space is really lovely and fun for kids! The BED IS AMAZING! Amazing! We had a much-needed incredible sleep. I also cannot get over all the thoughtful details - the apartment uses non-toxic soaps, and has many zero waste/conscious products - which we so appreciate. The towels and bedding were so soft. There are a plethora of little gestures that really made this stay so special for us. My husband said we can come to Birmingham and explore more just because of this sweet apartment. Also love that they take pets! Host and staff are really kind, great communication! Can’t say enough wonderful things. We will be back!"

The common areas were well kept and well lit, made for great sitting areas in the evening. The neighborhood was full of friendly people. Emma was a wonderful host who responded very timely. She allowed me to extend my stay when my flight plans changed. I recommend this property for anyone visiting Birmingham!"

Stayed a few nights","We loved our stay at Eden BRae! The grounds were beautiful and picturesque. The home was stunning and location was great. The bed and couch were super comfortable! I will say that there wasn’t much natural light in unit 3. While there were a lot of windows, the large windows are pretty much covered with blinds that you cannot really adjust. We also could hear the family staying above us as they walked around and ran up and down the stairs outside our window but that is to be expected staying at a multi-unit rental. If you are planning on spending a lot of your time exploring the city and not indoors or sleeping in, the lack of natural light and neighboring guests are not a problem. But worth noting depending on your vacation plans. We plan to come back!"

Her eye for detail and forethought in making guests feel pampered and comfortable is incredible.
The bed, and linens, were high quality and very comfortable. The shower was Amazing. The French press coffee pot was an added bonus.
The quality of the amenities Emma offers is unmatched by any Airbnb I've ever stayed at - and I have stayed at many. The outside is perfect for relaxing, napping or sipping a glass of wine. The photos do not do it justice. We were so pleasantly surprised.
My daughter and I did this trip to celebrate my birthday and Mother's Day and we cannot wait to go back.
If you're in Birmingham, this is the place to stay. You will not be disappointed, I promise."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I were in Birmingham to attend a reunion of our college classmates as well as to visit my two brothers, one of whom lives just up the street from Eden Brae and the other a very short distance away. Our reunion was held at the Clubhouse on Highland which was literally just down the street a few blocks. All of this made Eden Brae a perfect location! We loved staying in Apt 3 ! It matched the description and was in fact even nicer, we thought, in person. It was quiet, comfortable and lovely in every way. Our check in was super easy! Emma is a great hostess and communicates extremely well and makes sure you have all the instructions needed. We slept soundly- the linens are fabulous. The plush towels in the bathroom give a feeling of luxury. The lotions, soaps, shampoos and room fresheners are great and a real treat to indulge in after a long day. We both appreciated and enjoyed the delicious snacks and teas that were thoughtfully provided. Definitely will return!"

Immaculately clean, tastefully decorated, thoughtfully organized. Folks, she left stuffed animals and books for children in case one should stay here, snacks and breakfast options, SPOTLESS space. Amazing bed, blackout shades and a responsive thermostat. The shower alone would be reason enough to stay here. Beautifully tended grounds, lots of privacy, peaceful and safe. Professional, punctual, proactive hostess.

Stayed with kids","The Edenbrae apartment had top-notch quality amenities (soups/shampoos, coffees, beverages, snacks and breakfast basics). The grounds were also a lovely part of the experience if you make the most of it. The swings, hammocks and fountains were wonderous. The outdoor dining area was a great atmosphere and set-up to have a lovely and memorable meal. The host's guidebook (accessible through the Airbnb reservation) has lots of closeby recommendations with annotations. The design of the apartment itself had a bit of an odd mix of large, spacious spaces and tighter, cozier ones. The shower is the biggest I’ve ever seen. The bedroom had some large floor space in addition to the king sized and single bed. The kitchenette however was quite tight. The paint scheme was also a bit dim when compared to the beauty created outside on the grounds."

Better quality furniture and amenities than we have found in most (if not all) other AirBnBs. Very professional, yet accommodating and comfortable. Little touches I appreciated most were the variety of pillow densities on the bed, dog treats on the shelf, and the cleanliness of the hammocks and swings outside."

Stayed one night","Honestly, this stay was rough. I think Emma and Vanessa are trying to do something good, and I wanna support that, but a lot of things were bad.
Started with a misdirect in pricing, adding $20 for each guest, a bait & switch I’ve never seen on Airbnb for just a 2nd guest. Continued with the overwhelmingly long house rules they send upon booking, which left us stressed that they were gonna fine us for any issue, and also feeling a bit unsafe wondering who the heck else is staying on the property that has necessitated this diligence. Then the door was unlocked upon arrival— extra unsettling since every light was off. Had to enter the unit and fish for a light switch before we could tell if someone was inside. The place was also freezing cold. All of which had us on edge for the start of the stay.
Also, the rooms are nowhere near as bright and warm as the highly edited photos. The walls are painted very muted cool tones that make the space feel grim, especially at night. The bed and the sofa bed are both covered in a drab white blanket that looks like a motel 6. A book on rape on the bookshelf finishes the depressing vibe.
Lastly, the setup makes for limited functionality. The only table is a narrow bar behind the couch, which leaves two people with anything more than one plate each nervous about knocking food onto the one nice piece of furniture. The TV faces 90 degrees away from said couch and you can’t rotate it. There’s no dishwasher (which I should’ve noticed, but merits mention in the description since that’s rare these days) and the dish drainer in the sink means you’re splashing clean dishes while washing a dirty one.
Just a lot of improvements needed to match what’s presented in pics and make it feel welcoming.
On the positive, the big colorful shower was a nice way to start the day and the front yard of the building is beautiful."

It’s the perfect amount of space for one or two guests, and even has a great comfy day bead and couch if you needed more than the king sized super comfy bed!
The space is the perfect little getaway for a week/weekend of fun out on the town in Birmingham. It was super clean and neat, and the vibe/aesthetic/style of the little apartment was PERFECT! So cute and cozy. Emma was fantastic in giving us all the necessary info we could possibly need in our welcome message, so we really didn’t have any questions. It was conveniently located and the space was perfect for what we needed. Oh, and the tea provided was delicious and I LOVED the lotion in the bathroom.
All in all, GREAT spot to stay for a time in Birmingham. We’ll definitely be back!"

One checked in, I was almost late to my event 5mins away because I didn’t want to leave the space. Gate card was provided for easy in and out access during my trip which was so convenient(definitely added to the safety factor). Came back “home”, watched tv, took an amazing shower and passed out in a bed that seemed to have swallowed me. There was no windows in the bedroom and I loved it. I slept like a rock. I loved everything about this space and I’ll definitely book again in my next trip to the city. Thank you all for an amazing experience. Cheers"

Loft had a modern look and was located in a good central location; close to a lot of restaurants (one was right next door) and stores. There were a few things that could be updated or fixed (old toilet seat/ towel rack in bathroom was loose so it would pop out) but it was nothing major that would’ve impacted my decision to stay here. Very quiet once inside. We are very pleased with our stay.

Exposed wires and torn down walls literally outside the door and also the other side of the wall is full construction, and the fire alarm went off twice, at 8 and 9am. Also loud yelling contractors on the outside patio starting at 8am making the outside awkward. I guess give it time maybe? Or just update the listing."

We contacted property management but no one answered. We knocked on the door and immediately the lady responded. Oh yeah, the card keys are located on the bike rack. Weird but ok. It would’ve been nice to have instructions for guests checking in. Airbnb had obstructed views, small room, and full size bed. Not worth $227.31. Check out some of the properties downtown instead."

Stayed one night","LOVED this place. Tripp expertly decorated this cozy gem in the middle of a quiet neighborhood. Not fussy...it's modern, but with warmth. The view to the backyard's natural setting gives you the feeling you are in the woods. The inside had plenty of space for our overnight stay. (Really, I would have stayed a week if I had time.) There is a sweet little kitchenette with enough supplies to accommodate. Tripp communicated well throughout. He quickly responded to all my needs. No problems at all with the temperature in the apartment...he will move it to whatever you want, even if it's just 1 degree difference. Stay here!"

Stayed with kids","Great location and a great space. I'd say it has a minimalist feel with all the necessities for daily needs! We were traveling with a 1 year old and sometimes spaces like these are a headache because they aren't baby proof but this space was safe for him. Our only complaint was that we arrived late at night (notified the host of this early the day of check in) and it didn't seem like the heat was on (we stayed in February). As the guest you do not have access to the thermostat. Contacted the host to have the heat turned on/up so we could go to sleep after a long day of travel, they were responsive however it was still very cold through the night and didn't seem like it warmed up much at all. I slept our son in a layered sweat suit to stay warm. I contacted the host again in the morning to ask if it could be turned up again and even after this it was still cold. We used a small space heater provided by the host the rest of our time to avoid having to message them daily about the heat."

Stayed with kids","My daughter had a track meet in Birmingham so decided to get an airbnb outside in Hoover because heard it was safe and being alone with children I choose there, location was awesome felt very friendly and right at home kinda suburban feel. I was nervous about it being apart of someone's house but once there it feels private. The entire apartment was cute and homey. comfortable bed. My kids slept on the couch and said the pull out was comfortable as well. There was a huge mall about 3 miles away so we did some Christmas shopping and had a great time. Also highly recommend Habaneros Mexican Grill. Super friendly waiters incrediblely fast service and a fun decorated atmosphere. Next track meet will definitely stay again especially for the price."

It took us a minute to figure out which door to enter because two had code access and it was dark so we didn't realize one was for the garage. We appreciated little touches like floor lamps, throw blankets, water bottles, and to go coffee cups. The space has potential but a couple things need attention. It felt ""staying at a friend's house"" clean. Overall it worked great for the night."

Stayed a few nights","We had an amazing stay in Birmingham! This place is beautifully constructed with real hardwood floors, exposed brick, high ceilings, and well designed with comfortable furnishings, kitchen, bathroom and laundry amenities. The beds and linens were of very good quality -- sturdy and clean. This place is the real deal for those with discerning taste. The surrounding amenities were plentiful -- there is a nearby food hall across the street and a grocery within a 6-min drive. The Historic 4th Avenue Business District, National Park site of the AG Gaston Motel, BHAM Institute of Civil Rights, the Historic 6th Street Baptist Church, Lyric, Carver and Alabama Theaters are all nearby! We felt right at home and weren't quite ready to leave because we loved this place so much. The hosts were extremely responsive and friendly. Also, the car garage was perfect so you don't have to pay for parking on the street or in the adjacent lot. If I could make this my home in Birmingham, hands-down, I would"

The loft was true to the photos (I think it was even nicer than it looks in the listing), had a well appointed kitchen and very comfortable bed. Neighborhood is very walkable and other areas of interest a short drive away. One extremely minor note for light sleepers considering this rental is that this loft is right above the garage and the door opening is quite noisy from within the unit; with only four spots it did not open often, obviously it is a brief noise when it happens, and it did not impact our enjoyment of this otherwise fantastic property. We would stay here again if we return to Birmingham."

There is extra measures to ensure the bedrooms are quiet which was very appreciated."

Stayed a few nights","we stayed here for three nights, three of us, in town for Furnace Fest. we were flying in from San Francisco, Seattle, and Orlando, site unseen, as none of us had been to Birmingham before. This place is a massive two bedroom loft in the heart of downtown. everything is new and clean. the kitchen and dining room are huge and well equipped. you're less than a block to great coffee, great ramen and sushi and some really fun bars and restaurants within a 5-10 minute walk. it's also about a 5 minute walk to campus and only slightly further to the Publix. One of us rented a car but since it wasn't practical to drive back and forth to the Fest, it just stayed in the really nice garage space downstairs. if it was a 15-minute Uber ride to the Fest or even to the airport it was a long time. 10/10 this was a great deal."

This loft is conveniently located near good restaurants and sites of interest. Parking in the garage below the building was safe and convenient.

There is so much space & well built, so sound does not travel from the spread out bedrooms to the front room. It is thoughtfully decorated & the Alabama sign right out the front windows is perfection. We felt the location was unbeatable. Not only is the place beautiful & clean, but the hosts were quick to respond & very accommodating! We will absolutely be back & highly recommend!"

We typically rent an AirBNB with the thought of leaving to do stuff, however, we stayed in these cons night.
To be honest- one of my favorite places I have stayed.

Group trip","My family stayed at Tres' Airbnb for 4 nights and we very much enjoyed this home. It was the perfect size for the five of us! The neighborhood is very peaceful and we all felt safe.
There were a few minor things I wish we had readily available such as pot holders and small dressers in the master bedroom and one of the bedrooms and the closet hanging system needed to be tightened. The AC unit could not completely keep up with the heat by nighttime, however we did stay on one of the hottest weeks and there were fans in the closets that we were able to take out and use at night which were helpful.
We still very much enjoyed our stay! Tres provided toilet paper to start the stay, coffee pods and creamers, laundry detergent and even soap, shampoo and conditioner in the bathrooms along with makeup remover wipes. It was very thoughtful! I do want to point out that we didn't reach out to Tres, so he did not know we experienced minor issues.
100% would stay here again!"

Stayed with kids","Perfectly sized home for our family getaway. It was well stocked with necessities, the kitchen was perfect for cooking in & also had little extras that we appreciated! We loved the keyless entry and it was such a nice surprise that it had Smart TVs with excellent WiFi. Highly recommend this Air BNB and we are already talking about our next stay at this home!"

Stayed with a pet","We would absolutely stay again! Tres provided us with so much information before we even arrived at the house and from the moment we got there he was so helpful with everything. The house is really clean and provides all necessary amenities. He provided more than enough coffee and creamers, which is an added bonus for us. We traveled with our two dogs and the yard was big enough to walk them around and have plenty of outside time. We recommend Tres’s place to anyone looking to stay in the Birmingham area."

Stayed with kids",This cute house is in a safe neighborhood. It was comfortable for our family. Not far from Walmart and lots of different places to eat. Only a couple things that would make our stay better would be nicer pillows and towels. They are on the very cheap side.

Stayed with a pet","Home is very nicely remodeled with a lovely kitchen, bathrooms, and comfy beds. Space is clean and uncluttered. We were out and about during our stay, but the house has games, a fireplace and fire pit, and would be nice for staying in with family, too. Tres is a kind and responsive host and was flexible with a late check-in.
The air conditioning wasn’t working on a hot day, but that certainly wasn’t in the host’s control and he was responsive and having it fixed the day we checked out.
Thanks for a nice stay, Tres!"

Stayed a few nights","This was a great place right outside of Birmingham. The house was perfect for a short vacation. We stayed for three nights. The neighborhood was super quiet and served as a great jumping off point to visit Oak Mountain State Park, Noccalula Falls, Cheaha State Park and many other great places. The host is super responsive and will take good care of you."

Group trip","This home was exactly as pictured. Spotlessly clean, spacious, relaxing fireplace, and included small amenities (plenty of coffee pods and creamer, shampoo & conditioner, laundry detergent) that made a world of difference to us. Ease of entry, clear communication, and overall superb experience and only a few of the many reasons we would return!"

Stayed with a pet","This 'cottage' was a great fit for a mature couple as a long-stay for home renovation work. The open kitchen / living / dining is plenty spacious for a couple or small family. We were familiar with the neighborhood and knew it would be safe and quiet. Streaming TV had every choice imaginable and smaller units in two bedrooms nice touch. The WIFI connection was great quality as I continued my work-from-home seamlessly on the dining table - using the breakfast bar for meals. Kitchen had all the needs for a short-stay and most for a long-stay. Two decent-sized bathrooms with spotless fixtures. Washer and dryer a plus! Excellent communication from start to finish. Quality owner shows!
This is a long-established neighborhood (early to bed, church next door) and may not be best fit for a particular renter's plans. Just saying ..."

The electric fireplace was a hit and the kids loved making it a different color each day. Can’t wait to stay there again in our next trip to Gardendale"

Stayed a few nights","This is a great rental! I stayed here with my spouse and parents while we were in town to visit my daughter and her family. The proximity to Birmingham allowed us to enjoy some attractions, but we were able to retreat to the cozy house at the end of the day. You immediately feel at home when you come in to the unit. The open floor plan allows for everyone talk while you are in the kitchen and living room areas. The fireplace added warmth and charm to the space. If you are looking to cook, the kitchen has everything you would need. The bedrooms were spacious and had very nice linens. The beds were very comfortable too.
I know we will book this unit again. The owner was very responsive and helpful, even leaving lights on for our evening check in. If you are looking for a place to stay in Gardendale, this is it!"
