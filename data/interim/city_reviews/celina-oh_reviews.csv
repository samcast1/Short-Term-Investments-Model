Stayed with kids","This is a 10-star property to make other Airbnb hosts look like amateurs! Very well appointed and accommodating with clear attention to providing guests a home away from home. The property is so complete it gives the impression the hosts actually live there and gave us the keys while they were out.
Comfortable and quiet. Board games and puzzles. Hot tub and fire pit. Complete kitchen with washer and dryer. Clean and organized. Walking paths and lake. All exceeding expectations.
The best compliment is that we were there four days and our teenagers wanted to stay longer."

Stayed a few nights","I have stayed in several Airbnb’s and have to say this has been my favorite stay. My husband and I drove through the area once while I was working and had always talked about returning for a long weekend visit.
I booked the Cottonwood Cottage and the host reached out promptly. I was given instructions on how to reach location ( I did get a little mixed up at first, but found my way), and there was a binder in the home with details about the home as well as the surrounding city.
Not only was the home immaculately clean, but the beds were the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The host also provided items that you don’t tend to see in these types of units. There were plenty of cleaning supplies, make up remover wipes, some condiments and spices for cooking, and plenty of linens and back up items, such as paper towels and toilet paper.
Additionally, the property was adorable and decorated nicely. I definitely plan to return!"

Stayed a few nights","Quaint cottage just off the lake, was updated and clean. Well-stocked kitchen. Sofa was very comfy with a large smart TV in living room. My kids really liked the bunkbeds.
The hot tub was great, felt nice even though it was cold outside. We went off-season, so didn't do anything on the water and it was rainy so couldn't use the firepit either. Short drive to St. Mary's or Celina. I'm pretty sure we'll be back in the summer so we can enjoy other outdoor activities."

The place was extremely clean and literally steps away from the marina if you had a boat to enter the water. Would recommend 100% for anyone needing a relaxing and peaceful location for family or friends! If we make it back to the area, we will definitely be back!"

Stayed with kids","Took a gamble on 220 Lakeland and boy did it pay off! We carefully selected this property in order to have an unobstructed view of the April 8th total solar eclipse. The location did not disappoint. We met a few of the neighbors and everyone was very kind, one gentleman even allowed our daughter to take his kayak onto the lake. The surroundings were so peaceful and calm which made it easy to unwind while we were there. The beds were comfortable and the whole place was well appointed. We spent most of our time playing in the yard though. The lawn is immaculate! We travel with various sports gear and really enjoyed playing catch barefoot in the backyard. The only suggestion I have would be to supply some items that would encourage future guests to unplug and take advantage of the outdoor areas beyond the spacious patio. If kayaks were an option, we definitely would have put them to good use!"

Stayed one night","We booked a short overnight stay just to get away. The apartment was easy to locate, but the entrance took a few minutes to find on the building since there were a few possibilities.
Inside, it was VERY clean with all of the amenities that were listed. Decor was sparse, nothing on the walls, so it appeared more sterile vs ""homey"". Floor lamps or table lamps in the living room. All that was available was the recessed lighting in the ceiling, which made it VERY bright for relaxing or watching a movie.
The beds were clean and had several pillows. The mattresses were on the firm side (in our opinion). Nice blankets on the bed for comfort.
We enjoyed our brief stay and would recommend it to others. ❤️"

Stayed a few nights","It was a great place to stay. We were there for a wedding, so we pretty much used this as a place to sleep. It is clean and comfortable. And right in the center of town, but very quiet. There were a few bugs to work out, such as no closets or hooks for our wedding clothes. Steph is working on this. Furniture they ordered months ago has not come in yet. We had that same problem last fall. Also the elevator was not opening when we pushed the button on the ground floor. I had to walk up the stairs to send the elevator to the first floor so my daughter could get in. Steph says she also is working on getting that repaired. We would definitely stay there when we visit family again. It is a very nice place."

Beds were comfortable and kitchen was well stocked with pots and pans and dishes. The neighbor across the street had a litter of kittens that would cat around in their own yard and were a lot of fun to watch from the front door. I would definitely stay here again."

The home itself was beautiful and and even had a small game room which was perfect when our niece visited. the dinning table is large with enough space for 5 or 6 people and was great for playing cards. The chairs were hard to move and struggled to roll however the home itself was beautiful and the beds were comfortable.

Stayed with a pet","Ryan is a great host! His place is as described and squeaky clean. He responded quickly to my stay request and and any questions that I had. We were in town for a family member's birthday that actually lives in the same neighborhood where Ryan's place is located so it made things super convenient. Ryan's place is in a neighborhood setting and is literally a stone's throw from a local bar (which does serve food), a restaurant (open seasonally) and Grand Lake so you'll have plenty to do without having to get into your car. The only thing I would advise anyone that Ryan approves to bring their dog is that the yard is not fully fenced so you'll need to keep that in mind. The fencing is privacy fence in the back and sides, which is great for relaxing on the screen porch but an open fence along the front of the yard and not enclosed by the driveway."

Stayed with a pet","Ryan’s place was perfect for our short stay, as a stop over on the way to our destination. We wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy all the things the house had to offer. One of the bedrooms has a great en suite with nice touches. The location was perfect and felt private, despite being located around other houses and was quiet while we visited in winter. While there was just two of us, the house is large enough to accommodate several people and the layout is not crowded, so there’s plenty of space to spread out. The attached “three seasons” room would be an awesome place to hang out, especially in summer and fall. Ryan had great communication and it was very easy to access the code to get in the door. Thank you for your thoughtfulness in leaving treats for our dog and for hosting us in your lovely home."

The kitchen was stocked well with pots, pans, a griddle, and plenty of plates and silverware. The icemaker does not work and no ice trays were present. The listing is for 6 people but the kitchen table only has 4 chairs and the living room only has 5 seats. The enclosed patio has no furniture, bring chairs. I would revisit this location but would have to bring a few things."

Stayed a few nights","My Mom and I rented this home in Celina for a weekend so we could attend a family reunion. Overall, Ryans place was very nice. It was clean, in a nice area close to the lake, and quiet.
From the check-out cleaning instructions it sounded like there was a washer/dryer in the home, but the host confirmed for us that there is none. If you need to do laundry there is a laundry mat about 15 min away in downtown Celina.
The only real issue we had was that the house was advertised as 3 bedrooms but the 3rd bedroom was locked. My sister (who is 5 months pregnant) was feeling exhausted after the reunion and wanted to lie down. I invited her back to the AirBnB to nap for a bit but the 3rd bedroom was locked. The house was advertised as 3 bedrooms and if I’m being charged for 3 bedrooms, I expect to have access to all 3 rooms for the time I’m renting the home. I did not pop the lock and my pregnant sister ended up napping on the couch."

Had we not been busy at the track everyday this would have been a great little vacay spot for lake time. House was as described. Beds were comfortable we had plenty of towels, etc for our needs. I will warn you of the mosquitoes and gnats outside due to the proximity of the lake so if you plan to be outside at the house a lot you may want to bring mosquito spray this time of year. Overall we would happily stay here again without hesitation."

Group trip",Overall enjoyed our stay. Could tell things had been recently renovated. I'm sure it will be even nicer when they finish decorating. There was some confusion about pricing when we booked and the host asked us to re-book with an extra $30 charge since we had 6 people (which is what the house sleeps?) Not sure why there was extra charge for that. Did allow us to check in early which was appreciated.

Just northwest of the house is a lovely neighborhood to walk in. Check out The James Watson House for excellent dining. Nearby Baker Woods was a pleasant walk. The lake is close, but you have to navigate Market Street and walk a bit west for better access. Celina is a pleasant little town."

Available utensils, fully stocked pots and pans! The little things most places don’t have, Stacey had. I was impressed.

Stayed a few nights","Spotlessly clean, nicely decorated, second floor apartment on Main Street, right in the heart of downtown Celina. You can walk to several bars/restaurants in a minute or less. There is plenty of free parking (on street and in a large municipal parking lot directly across main street.) This is a great location to explore the lake, dine, or enjoy an adult beverage and meet the very pleasant locals. Everything is within easy walking distance.
Located in a historic building (1902?) there are some artifacts, newspaper clippings and photos in the main room, which also boasts a tiny balcony and an absolutely giant bay window overlooking Main Street. Some of the original woodwork is still preserved in the main room, as well.
The bed was quite comfy, and the keyless entry made check-in and access a breeze."

Stayed a few nights","Terry and Cecelia's bungalow was the perfect place for me and my daughter to relax and get some rest during a weekend volleyball tournament. It was conveniently located one house from the lake in a residential area, offering beautiful views and peace and quiet. Unfortunately, I can't speak to the surrounding parks and features because we only had time to visit local restaurants before crashing for bed to rest up for the following day's tournament games.
Each of the rooms had a separate thermostat which was nice for each of our individual comfort levels. They were also kind enough to stock the fridge with bottled water and the cabinet with k-cups for the Keurig.
Only area that needs improvement is the fire stick, which appeared to be outdated and was glitchy and sometimes unresponsive. However, Cecelia dropped what she was doing, dropped off an adapter to connect my phone to the tv and have since upgraded the fire stick so the next visitor doesn't have any issues."

I asked in the early evening if they could add a app to the TV so I could access my You Tube TV account. Cecelia came over within minutes and between the two of us we were able to figure out how to add the app to the TV so we could have the access. Terry & Cecelia were fantastic hosts. If I come to Grand Lake St. Marys for another fishing tournament I will definitely stay there again.

Stayed a few nights","We loved the place. Just the right amount of space that we needed for a weekend. It was close to the race track which made the drive after the race easy.
The pictures are very accurate. We did not cook during our stay but the kitchen was well stocked and would have had anything we needed to cook. The bed in the master bedroom was very comfortable as was the bed in the second bedroom. Wish we could have used the patio but rain kept us from it. The two window air conditioners cooled the bungalow nicely.
We are already looking to reserve it for next year's race weekend."

The only real issue we found was that the lake apparently is very polluted (all the locals told us) so it is used way more as a fishing lake than a swimming lake. The hosts were communicative and helped with all of our questions. We loved it and will be returning! Such an awesome trip!!!"

Parking is at a premium, so if you plan on bringing a boat you will need to make arrangements to dock or park it somewhere. The owners can help you with places. Will definitely stay here if we return to Celina. Close to downtown and other places of interest.We give this property the highest rating we can."

The house is well stocked and supplied and for coffee aficionados, you have your choice of a Keurig or a Mr. Coffee machine. We came home after long days, and truly felt at home.

Tip for anyone staying with more than 2 people - the hot water in the shower runs out after about 30 minutes. So take breaks in between showers.

Stayed one night","Excellent, CLEAN, little home, centrally located to everything. The kitchen was very well stocked, although we didn't use it ( who wants to cook when you are on a 1 day/night ""vacation""?? Not me). The bed was very comfortable, so was the couch apparently, because that's where my husband slept, and he was snoring, so that's where I left him. 😌
I was pleased to see the shower had 4 full size bottles of shampoo/ conditioner, and body wash. The towels were soft, not thin and scratchy like some places have. There was a drawer with a hair dryer, first aid kit, even makeup wipes. The neighborhood was cute, and quiet. Considering we came on the very last weekend of October, we weren't able to get out on the water, but we drooled looking at the pontoon boat parked just beyond the sliding glass doors. Clearly, the hubs and I will return in warmer weather, and if they're lucky, we might bring the kids.😃"

They quickly got back to me on any questions and, the house being located just 1 mile from finishline right on the route, they cheered me on, kept my family company and even took some pics and videos for me! like that is just awesome. they totally didn't have to do that but that's just what extremely hospitable people do and they were nothing short of it. If you plan on doing that event at anytime. I definitely recommend it as it is so close and right on the route! And you may have extra cheerleaders 😊"

We were in town with the heatwave and the window air conditioners kept it comfortable along with fan. The house has plenty of kitchen necessities (silverware, dishes, pots and pans). There is a washer and dryer available also. This place served as a good home base to come back to after day trips."

Stayed a few nights",Communication and check in was quick and easy. The home is so cute and clean. The location is amazing and quiet. Just a short walk to lakeside and a beautiful view. It is close to any shopping that is needed. Flowers on table at arrival was an a wonderful touch. I would definitely stay again in future.

They provided a lot of recommendations on where to go and what to eat in the area. All of their instructions were clear and understandable and provided an enjoyable experience. Jaxson and Tia were the sweetest dog greeters. Would definitely recommend for a trip for a little R&R.

Stayed a few nights","We came into the area to visit family who don't have extra space for us to stay with them for a week. Terry and Cece's place was a great place to get away and relax in a very nice, quiet home. We live in a large metropolitan city, and being out of that environment was much needed. Terry and Cece's place was exactly what we needed.
The home was very clean and well-equipped. We were there for 6 nights, and had everything we needed amenity-wise to have a very nice stay. We had a chance to meet Terry and Cece and spend a little time chatting with them (they live next door). They are both very kind, welcoming, and hospitable people. They even shared fresh vegetables with us from their garden. It was very nice. They have two cute little dogs that make the place even more welcoming and sweet.
The house is situated at the end of a quiet street with a view of the lake. There are many stores and restaurants nearby, so every need was met. We didn't get out on the water, but that wasn't part of our plan so it's OK. We did go to the state park on the lake (about a 10 minute drive down route 703), and enjoyed walks, runs, and a picnic in the park by the lake. We would highly recommend staying here if you are coming into the Celina area."

It is located right off main street with food and more then one coffee option within walking distance. We were sadly to busy to easy the lake but you can also walk there as well!

Stayed with kids","We enjoyed Steph's property during our stay for a family member's wedding in Celina. Apparently, the property is an old mansion built in 1908, separated into multiple apartment units and common spaces. We stayed in Apt #3. Although the property is being renovated, we were not at all disturbed. What has been renovated looks amazing, with modern features. The apartment was decorated extremely well, and we were pleasantly surprised by the architectural features and abundance of space. Our 12 yo son loved the TV consoles with electric fireplaces in every bedroom -- what a fantastic choice! The trendy gray/white color palette was perfect, and the beds were comfy. AC is via window units with remote controls, but they worked extremely well and kept us cool without problem. I couldn't tell if the property still relied on radiator heat, but there was a radiator in nearly every room, which does date the space a tad; we hardly noticed them, though. We appreciated the color-coordinated baskets in each room, which we used for dirty clothes before replacing with our linens when we left. Steph left a bottle of wine, sodas, waters, and snacks out for us, which was a nice touch. Just note that the wine is red but sweet. There was a well-appointed laundry room and a lobby of sorts, as well. The location was central to everywhere we needed to go. This really was a great space!
There were a few things missing that would have made the experience better and more convenient: A coffeemaker and an iron on premises, although there was an ironing board. To us, these amenities are standard, but going back to the listing, I saw that they are not listed. Such an easy thing to overlook when making a booking because these amenities are rather standard across Airbnbs and hotels, at least in the US. Hopefully, Steph makes the small investment to provide those for future guests. Also, the entry hall is extremely dark at night (and a bit spooky, especially with doors that have no door knobs). Again, the space is being renovated. We left the light on once when we were away at night, but we thought that a hall light with motion-sensor would be better.
Overall, we would happily stay at this property again! Our friends and family in the area had no idea that the property existed, but we raved on about it and recommended they consider this option when they have family come to town. Once we confirm our holiday plans, we'll be sure to look to this listing for availability. Thanks for a wonderful stay, Steph!"

I wish the beds were not rock hard - for those who have bad backs - however, we still slept so sound ! It was quiet, peaceful and just so so beautiful!

It’s worth noting that no one really goes in the lake due to toxic algae issues, and that some restaurants aren’t open during the week. The pier pictured in one of the photos isn’t available to guests of this condo, which we were bummed about since it’s beautiful!

We didnt need airports or flights so I felt safer. We arrived at the home it was spotless. The view from the living room and kitchen. Absolutely priceless. We loved it so much my group and I decided to look for a place there. We found a great amount of shopping which I did not expect, you can rent a pontoon boat nearby (no jetskis) and a great waterfront restaurant right next door. We used the gas grill to do steaks and crablegs and Lynn had everything we needed. This home is great for family trips, girls getaways, covid getaways and couples. The balcony I could have just slept on. Stay here you will not regret it. The towns people were so friendly too!"

She had a binder full of local information (restaurants, coffee shops, etc) and there were specific instructions for each thing- for example, how to use the different remotes to watch cable/Netflix etc. The view from the back windows and patio is GORGEOUS. I wish we had been able to stay longer! It was a very peaceful and relaxing."

Stayed with kids","Beach Escape #304 is an immaculate condo right on Grand Lake St. Marys. The view is as amazing as it is peaceful. Both my daughter and I saw an Eagle flying, which was very cool. The condo itself is very spacious and had plenty of room for our family of four to spread out and not be on top of each other. You will not find a more organized rental anywhere; there is literally a place for everything. Lynn has thought of everything one could need. The absolutely only con, as small as it is, would be that the master bed is very firm to sleep on. The unit provided a very relaxing and enjoyable Fall break."

The condo is super clean and has every amenity you could dream of. The decor looks like it was professionally designed and the furniture was very inviting and comfortable. The fire pit and complementary wood made for a fun night making samoores while laughing and telling stories by fire light. Fishing off the dock only steps from your door provided hours of enjoyment for my entire family. We can't wait to return and create many more family memories.

We had our own two-bedroom house, with a fully stocked kitchen (Keurig machine and complimentary coffee a big plus!) and a full-sized washer and dryer combo in a separate laundry room. The laundry room even has a utility sink! The living room boasts comfortable furniture and a big screen TV with numerous cable channels. Cable TV is also in both bedrooms. The rainhead shower was wonderful, and plentiful hot water was never an issue for the three of us staying there. We were so grateful to have such a nice place to come back to for relaxing after long, full days visiting relatives in nearby Indiana. The beds were very comfortable. For those who are light sleepers like me, turn on your white noise app at night. I slept very well. Highly recommend breakfast at The Fountain down the street (nice walk too) to make your stay complete. Friendly, communicative host. Looking forward to staying at Stacey's place again!"

The location is also convenient to the major stores or restaurants if you would need. We mainly stayed in and cooked and there were plenty of dishes and cooking utensils to use. The couches have been updated and are very comfortable. The beds and linens were comfortable as well. Overall this was a nice stay and we would return again in the future.

This is a cute house and perfect for us for the weekend. Aside from previously mentioned noise from traffic, we would definitely stay here again. In addition, dinner Friday night at Bella’s was great!"

There is a soaker tub that I didn't notice in the photos either. Also, Celina is such a cute, quaint little town. The lake is beautiful and practically across the street (bring bug repellent because... lake). There wasn't much space to walk the dog as it is a busy street, but I threw him in the car, drove less than a mile to a beautiful lakeside park. I would highly recommend this place and would stay here again in a heartbeat."

There are tools in the kitchen for those who like to cook while traveling and the kitchen is very clean and updated. The rest of the house is in the same condition. The bed in the back bedroom was especially comfortable! As mentioned in other reviews, the house is on a main thoroughfare and traffic can be quite busy during the day but quiets down after around 10pm. Overall, I was very happy with my stay in Stacey's place!"

She had breakfast bars and cereals available and K-cups for the Keurig, which was nice since we don’t have one at home. The home is very clean and comfortable. We didn’t spend much time there as we were there for our granddaughter’s grad party; so we didn’t do any cooking, but there seemed to be everything available to cook with if you wanted to. This is the second time we’ve stayed and we look forward to staying there again in the future."

Stacey had a notebook out for us with maps and information for local businesses. Good parking right next to the house, walking distance to fast food places. The other comments posted are quite true, there is a lot of noise from the main street where you enter. One of the bedrooms is right by Celina's main street and we heard cars/traffic all night."

Stayed a few nights","This was our second stay with Stacey. The Market Street Inn is perfect as a base For us while visiting family nearby. We really appreciate how clean the house always is. The kitchen is very nicely equipped. Has ample dishes and dining space for 6-8 people which came in very handy for hosting a couple of meals for nearby family. Beds are comfortable, with good quality linens. As others have noted, the front bedroom gets a good deal of traffic noise until late in the evening, but earplugs and white noise app helped quite a bit. Stacey is very responsive to any inquiries - we requested to stay over an extra night at the last minute and she graciously and quickly agreed. All in all, a very good place to stay in Celina, and very good value! Will definitely return on future visits. Thanks Stacey!"

Stayed with kids","We really enjoyed our first airbnb! It is on a main street, which we also enjoyed. I was able to run to the park and back for 2 miles in the am. We also took advantage of the Wendy's across the street and delivery pizza for our busy schedule. The traffic dies down around 11pm and it didn't bother us much. Knowing where the house was located, I expected it. The house is spotless. Everything was perfect for us. We liked it so much that we hope that our friends will rent Staceys other house next year and we will return! I hope that I have just as good of luck the next time that I stay at an airbnb."

Road noise is really loud in the front bedroom. If you are used to city living, it probably isn't going to be a problem for you. My house is set back from the road and the road I live on is a quiet road with little traffic. I'm not used to hearing traffic. I would still stay here again if in the area but I'd bring a white noise machine or something as it was disrutice for me."

Stayed a few nights","Location, Location, Location. This house sits on Grand Lake St Mary's a short (very short) walk across a small road (very slow if any traffic) finds you sitting in Adirondack chairs enjoying the lake. The sitting area comes with the property and the listing agent was nice enough to share this information with us upon our arrival. Entry was easy and the house was very nice. All amenities listed were present. The large screen TV in the living room was like going to the movies. We used our Netflix membership to watch. There were a few items that would have made our stay a little nicer. 1 a table. There was only a picnic table on the deck so when it was cold we ended up using tv trays and sitting on the floor picnic like when the trays were used. 2. A workspace. I needed to do some work while at the house, internet was great, but with no table and no workspace it was difficult. I ended up standing in the kitchen while working. We would return."
