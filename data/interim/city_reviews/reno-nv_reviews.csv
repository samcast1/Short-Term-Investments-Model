Stayed a few nights","This was one of my top favorite Airbnb stays! The location is perfect! The surroundings were beautiful with lots of roses and a neatly manicured property. The instructions on where to park were clearly marked. There was a fun hanging swing for two by the front door of the suite as well as a little nook on the deck to relax with a meal if desired.
The suite itself is awesome, with lots of cool and enjoyable amenities, such as a fantastic antique-looking gas stove fireplace which was easy to use and perfect for some warmth/to get the chill out when the temperatures dipped low at night and in the early morning. I got a kick out of the heated toilet seat and the toilet light too!
The kitchen was charming, and I admired the shower stall nestled between the bathroom and the laundry room--what a cute design! The bed was fantastic--so comfortable. I slept really well. It was a very quick and easy walk to the hotels/casinos as well as the river walk. I hope to be back!"

Stayed one night","My winning streak with Airbnb continues. This is a terrific little place. I absolutely loved the location, a very short walk from the Truckee River trail on a beautiful, tree-lined street mere blocks from downtown Reno. The place itself is small but it's cozy rather than cramped. Everything was clean and worked well, and communication from the owners was great. There's no television, but who comes to Reno to watch TV? I felt like I got a very good value here. Definitely recommended."

Stayed a few nights","It was nearly a perfect stay. Some small issues, but proactive communication made them ""no problem"". Location and price point perfect for what we needed. No television (maybe that's a feature, not a fault!) and perhaps a little loud (cats outside looking to hook-up, no fault of the airBNB). We'll definitely be back if we're ever in Reno again."

Stayed one night","The neighborhood is beautiful and quiet. Close to the River Walk and many restaurants, bars, and activities.
Bed was very comfortable - I felt like Goldie Locks - not too soft and not too hard - it was just right.
Pillows were very fluffy and cozy. If you prefer a thin pillow I recommend to bring your own.
Easy temperature control and peaceful lighting.
It was a lovely stay."

Stayed one night",Lisa’s suite is clean and has everything a person would need. Comfortable bed. Quiet. Charming. Plenty of blankets and towels/washcloths/hand towels. The water at the bathroom lavatory gets hot right away. Has anyone else mentioned that the toilet seat is heated? Prrrrr. Lisa got back to us right away with any questions we had. The suite is a short walk (3-4 minutes) to the gorgeous river walk. Don’t miss it! And it’s a 5-6 minute ride to the train station. So convenient. We would stay there again.

Stayed one night","An easy walk to the Reno Riverwalk, which is outstanding! We were able to walk to a fine restaurant, and choose to walk the river walk each day.
They have done a great job of taking an old brick rambler and creating a sweet place to stay.
The bath and shower are modest in size, but everything worked well. My wife was appreciating the heated toilet seat, which was new for her."

Thsi will be my first choice on my return trips and hopefully it will be available, would definitley stay here again."

From a pair of cozy robes to ample K-cups to charging ports right at the bed this is a very well stocked and well thought out space. Only thing I didn't notice when booking is there is no TV but honestly the great assortment of reading material (both books and magazines) made that a non-issue! There's even a bluetooth speaker to play music.

Stayed one night","Perfect location for visiting downtown Reno. Located in the block along the Riverwalk just far enough away ( 4-5 blocks) from downtown. I could be in the middle of all the activity in a ten minute walk .The house is a one story remodeled home from the 20’s split into two units. This house is on the corner and the outside of the property is beautiful. Landscaping and lighting is a delight for the eyes.The rear unit is a super cool studio apartment with everything you need. Off street parking right outside your door. A fully equipped kitchen with lots of pantry items. The interior is very nicely decorated. The bed is super comfortable. The bathroom has a shower stall and all the items you could possibly want.Washer//dryer off of the bathroom. The interior(just like the exterior)is so cozy and welcoming. Lisa, the host is nearby and responsive if you have any questions. I would recommend this space to anyone I know who is visiting the area."

Stayed a few nights","In the past few months of traveling, this location had the absolute best customer service. Very quick to respond and very helpful, understanding, and accommodating. This was by far the most professional, yet personable experience I have had. The apartment was beyond adequate and no detail left aside. They have thought of everything. If you are into cooking while traveling, no problem—kitchen is ready to go. The mattress was incredibly comfortable and the linens and pillows were top notch; easily competing with the high end hotels in town—in fact I’d say there is no hotel in town that has this level of comfort. The close washer snd dryer is always appreciated as I definitely needed to do laundry before heading out via plane for my next destination. This place was highly walkable and the river walk was 1 block away. What a great experience. Back to the customer service/hospitality, if your new to hosting, come stay here for a night to experience how it should be done. Thanks!"

Stayed a few nights","The room was just as advertised. It was close to the river and a very nice walk in either direction from the river area . The bed was comfy, the room was very clean, the amenities were nice. Two recliners were provided. It was very quiet. The yard was nicely landscaped with lots of flowers. How nice!
We did have some small issues with the bathroom sink draining and the stopper. It sort-of worked after a lot of tinkering. I suspect that will be addressed before the next guests arrive. The bathroom is quite tiny, as is the shower. There was an odd ""cat lady"" that came by at evening twilight to place small syrofoam bowls filled with food for the neighborhood cats. She placed these bowls under cars in the neighboring parking lot including in the landscaping around the room. This was somewhat entertaining, but not being a cat person, I would be irritated if I actually lived here.
At any rate, I would recommend this room to fellow Airbnbers."

Stayed a few nights","Good value studio.
Pros:
- Quiet
- Good parking spot next to door
- Comfortable bed
- Fireplace stove heater is very nice
- Close to both downtown and midtown. Walk to river.
- Fairly well stocked kitchen
- OK water pressure
Cons:
- You have to take off shoes inside, even though there is no carpeting. Slippers are provided that are too small and result in cold feet. Bring a set of indoor-only warm footwear.
- There is an outdoor light next to the door that shines inside and can be disruptive at night; unscrew it to turn it off.
- No dish washer; you have to do your own dishes.
- The counter bar is very small; Might be tight for two people to eat.
- There is no surface in the bathroom near the sink to place a shaver bag.
- No TV: bring a laptop to stream Netflix"

The actual unit was very charming and had a great vibe both inside and out. Inside, I was greeted with snacks which after a long drive were very needed. It had everything I needed for my short stay but if I was staying longer, it was more than accommodating.
I did interact with Lisa in person and she was very friendly and made sure to answer any questions I had about the space as well as the surrounding area.
If I ever pass through Reno again, I will be sure to stay here as well as recommend it to my friends who may be passing through."

Stayed one night","This place was just as described. Location was great, as it is tucked away on a nice, quiet street, close enough to walk to downtown. A very short walk to the Riverwalk as well.
Parking was a breeze. You get one spot in the driveway right at the front door of the place as well as plenty of street parking available.
Has keypad code entry which is great, quick, and convenient. I had initially received the wrong code which delayed my check in a bit, however my issue was resolved relatively quickly and the rest of my stay was really smooth.
Bedroom was comfy, good size bed with plenty of pillows and blankets, even extra blankets available neatly folded just a few feet away, and the kitchen was on the tiny side but seemed to have just about everything you could need for a relaxing stay.
No television in the room though, so keep that in mind too.
Overall, I'd recommend the place and would totally stay here again."

This was my 2nd stay in an airbnb and I was delighted by the property and amenities. easy to get to the main road and airbnb makes it easy to pay and all aspects of the process.

Stayed one night",Lisa was very attentive to our needs and her home is very unique. We enjoyed the rest there. She had everything ready for us and answered our questions quickly. We will have to go back to talk about the bees as she had a last minute trip so wasn't there to talk. Even though she wasn't there she communicated very well with us. Great stay even with a storm coming in.

Her home is adorned with countless plants, which gives her home a lively and relaxing feel. Talking with her was great for getting to know the area, plus learn about bees. I highly recommend booking here for a hassle free, relaxing stay in Reno with a great hostess.
Side note, never forget to check for ticks. Just like your blood sugar, check and check often; spirochaetes, we don't like'em."

With the plants, paintings, sculptures and art of bees. The beehive is definitely a place to stay. The knowledge she taught me about bees made me realized they are a huge asset to our lives & can help us overcome obstacles we may face. She’s definitely a great teacher and will be huge impact to other lives with the knowledge she knows. I’ll definitely be coming back to Reno. Thank you so much & continue to spread the good aura. 🐝 (:"

It is located in a quiet safe neighborhood & easy to find. My room was cozy & even had an electric ""radiator"" style heater, to make sure I was warm enough. The bed was extremely comfortable, & my stay was peaceful & relaxing, which was welcome after spending the days with my 2 toddler granddaughters. The home was very clean, and Lisa was friendly, welcoming, & helpful. She even had a Christmas gift for me. I visit my children every 3 months, so I hope Lisa's home will be available each time I travel down to see them."

It turns out that I had appendicitis! Although I didn't spend the night there (I spent it at the hospital instead), I did visit Lisa's place, and meet her, so I thought it would still be appropriate to leave a review. I found Lisa to be friendly, open and accommodating! I was particularly pleased that she chose to refund my stay based on my unexpected medical emergency!"

Lisa was such a wonderful and kind host and her place is so lovely and cozy and reminiscent of all the best hippy vibes from Berkeley/San Francisco! Definite plant inspiration for me. She offered me watermelon, honey, and went out of her way to find and lend me a beach chair for my meteor shower event! What more can you ask for from a host? The bedroom was clean and internet was fast for remote working, and apparently pretty soundproof as well since she didn’t hear my meetings (which were pretty loud). If you get to stay here don’t hesitate!
Thank you Lisa for your hospitality and for embodying the spirit of Airbnb hosting!"

Stayed one night","I always seem to find the best airbnbs. Lisa is an exceptional host and just very good at making you feel comfortable.
As for the house and room; very very clean. I actually would say pristine to be definitive. Bathroom and towel closet had everything you need. Shower was warm, hot, and cold no problem but CLEAN as a whistle. Room spacious and perfect size for 1-2 people to be more than comfortable.
Again, everything was clean but most importantly you will feel SAFE and at peace here. Street was wide and safe with plenty of parks and stores around. Enjoy!"

Stayed one night","Lisa is what makes this feel like the home away from home. She has created a beautiful soul warming space and provides you the time and comfort you need. Not only is she a gracious host, but also a loving puppy sitter and there was a party of 4 clicking their nails on the hardwood floor that would come in and visit asking for pets. If you’re looking for a reasonably inexpensive place to stay not far from the casinos (10-15 min drive), look no further. She’s close to a shopping center, shares her fridge and teas and also provides healing services to those with inflammation and migraines. If you’re not allergic to bees, deeply curious about eastern medicine and feel a connection to energy, definitely consider a session with her!"

She’s set up everything to require very little thought in your stay. The beautiful little house is in my favorite of Reno’s neighborhoods, with fun quality restaurants, shopping, & a terrific gym nearby. It’s very safe & quiet, with many trees.

Stayed with a pet","Where do I start ... WE LOVED THIS HOME! When reserving, I was not sure how far away the home was to the Reno-Sparks Convention Center where we needed to be all weekend for volleyball. It was PERFECTLY situated just 15 minutes away in the quietest, most peaceful neighborhood. I have seen the bad review for pets, and I will say that this house had NO signs of being pet friendly - it was deep cleaned, and we had no complaints. We brought our shih tzu, and she loved the backyard! Yes, the home is an older updated home, but we loved the updates and furnishings - very nicely done! The beds were so comfortable, and the kitchen was comfortably stocked. It was a bonus that a beautiful park is one block away!! Michael was an incredible host. HIGHLY RECOMMEND for your Reno stay!"

Stayed a few nights","All in all it’s a very nice, comfortable, and well appointed home. There was a problem with the combination on the front door lock when checking in but Michael answered the phone immediately and sorted it right out. The only negative for me was that there is a lot of super inexpensive furniture and clearly amateurish construction. However, since I wasn’t buying the place or living there, it was probably just more of something that stood out to someone who made his living in construction. The quiet neighborhood is isolated from the hustle and bustle of the downtown area, yet has easy access to all that Reno has to offer."

Stayed with a pet","Michael's Airbnb provided one of the best stays I've ever experienced. In fact, I left Reno with the desire to buy a place nearby.
Its proximity to Lake Tahoe was what drew us in. We were looking for a place near Northstar with plenty of dining and nightlife options. Within a 15-minute drive, we found all-you-can-eat sushi, Los Angeles-tier cocktails, and a coffee shop that rivals what you'd find in San Francisco (think Blue Bottle but reasonably priced).
We also needed a place for our dogs to stay. Reno and Michael's are very dog-friendly. The kitchen has water and dog food bowls, the backyard has a patch of astroturf, and there is plenty of space for our 40-lb Goldendoodle. Down the street, a dog park stretches a quarter mile or so.
We're marking this Airbnb as a favorite and hope to stay here again next year."

Kitchen had plenty of pots, dishware, etc. Plenty of towels without having to do laundry. The neighborhood was very peaceful and well lit.

Stayed one night","This is a nicely remodeled house. It is labeled ""pet friendly"" and we have stayed numerous times in various places that are pet friendly as well with no traces of prior occupants. However, this house should be classified as ""Only for people with pets"" because we came into a residence with so much pet hair all over the house. From sitting on the living room sofa to getting into the beds, our clothes were filled with white pet hair. Reached out to the host and we were told around midnight that a cleaning crew could be provided, at midnight.... or another accommodation, at midnight.... Please beware, only stay here if you are willing and do not mind pet hair. This is not a home for those that want something clear of pet hair on their belongings."

Spent several late nights on the comfy couch watching the big screen tv in the living room, and the kids had their own tv in the bedroom. Loved that it was one level, no one had to haul luggage up any stairs.
Michael went out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed. His level of communication was perfect. Would definitely stay again if we're in Reno."

Very clean and comfy and since the house is in the back of the little development its nice and quiet. But of course, the hosts themselves are amazing and so sweet. If we ever come to Reno again we will be booking their listings!
Some great places to eat nearby:
Dopo Pizza (Best chocolate chip cookies)
Anna’s Taqueria
The Coconut Downtown
Two Chicks (best breakfast!)"

The place also smells really nice, but I can see it potentially being an issue if your sensitive to fragrances. There were also all the dish ware you would likely need, but bring some oil/seasoning if that’s something you’d want if planning to cook.
Thanks for everything, Mari! We’ll definitely come back if we need to be in the area again."

We had trouble booking which turned out to be a problem with Airbnb’s website. Mari was fantastic in helping getting the problem resolved as we were driving through areas with no cell reception.
When we arrived the home was exactly like the pictures, beautiful and modern. Set back from the road in a group of 6 homes meant both privacy and no noise. The area is undergoing a transformation, turning older run down homes into lovely modern homes.

Would stay there again if back in Reno."

Location was convenient. It felt like most of our meeting places for dinner and get togethers around town were all within 10-12 minutes.
We arrived in separate cars and greatly appreciated the free covered parking.
Appreciate the great stay!"

The minute you walk in the front door you can tell this is a labor of love for the host. Beautiful decor and all brand new. Nothing was broken or needing attention to detail because it was all taken care of and helpful notes and directions around the house. Easy covered parking and access made it simple to come and go at ease. Will be staying here again as the spaciousness and amenities were very accommodating as well was the host!

Stayed with kids",This was my first time renting an Airbnb and it was better than I had expected! We came to visit family that live in Reno. It was great to have such a nice home to stay in. Much better value than a hotel and enough room for us to spread out. We enjoyed going places but also enjoyed staying in at the house and just hanging out. The location is in a quiet neighborhood but close to the highway and other attractions. The host communicated in a friendly manor and even checked in (via text) part way through our stay. We had no issues but I’m certain if we had the host would have responded quickly. Hopefully we will be able to rent this house again when we come for our future visits to Reno!

Stayed with a pet","Nicholas’s place has a very playful and relaxing style. We made good use of the modern, well designed kitchen. Everything needed was there except spices, etc. Very comfortable sleeping, although we had to hang blankets in one large window that faced an alley with commercial night lighting. Second smaller bedroom was better in that regard. We had our pup with us, so the fully gated patio was great. It is shared with a business that has occasional visitors enter through this space which wasn’t a problem at all except they keep the entry gate open during business hours. Our pup doesn’t wander, but if someone had a pet with potential for leaving, there’s that. Potty area is a large patch of grass outside of the fenced patio, next to driveway. Worked okay for us. The location was great for walking along the river park, and to get to some restaurants and good beer. Just like a lot of city located places though, homeless folks also hang out in the space. No issues with anyone approaching us."

Plenty of amenities and furnishings that would be a great addition if you have a multi-night stay. Just be aware if you're traveling with pups, that though the patio is fenced in, it's a shared space that is completely paved and isn't a great space to let your dogs out and roam off leash."

Stayed with a pet","Stayed for a week, wifi was good during the week for work, very comfortable space. The unit is standalone, set behind a house that serves as a massage spa and you face that building from the main windows, there are random patrons sharing your walkway and shared patio space, but not a big deal. The unit is clean, a little dark but decorated nicely, owned by a few folks who own a few locations in Reno with the goal to crank out renters. We had an issue with our shower upon arrival and the host had a cleaner come by very quickly. Location is walkable to the river, and about 15-20 minutes walk from Midtown. If you go a few blocks in the opposite direction it gets a little dumpy but easy to avoid. We felt safe and we liked having the riverwalk to jog and walk the dog to. A nice place for a short stay!"

The house is at 5 minute drive from all the casinos and there is a shopping center 7 minutes drive away, with an In n out,Starbucks, Mountain Mike, Chipotle and more. So no struggling to find were to eat. Also we took our kids sledding/tubing to a spot that was a 30min drive from the house and it was amazing the kids had so much fun. So if your traveling with little ones this spots perfect. Master bed room has a king size bed and spear room a queen and they also have a playpin available to use as a crib if you have an infant. They kitchen has all the necessary tools for us to cook breakfast for the kids. We will definitely be booking again."

Stayed about a week","I live on the road in my RV and haven’t been in one place long enough to do some of the more mundane things like washing the van (first wash in 3 months). Other than that I had some custom upgrades done to the RV and needed 7 days in town just in case my outfitter needed extra time. I was able to get a lot of personal things accomplished as well. All in all, a productive week. Still a bit reserved going out in public (bars & restaurants) as long as Covid is circulating. So, this Airbnb was ideally suited for my needs, great kitchen! Personally, I loved the privacy of the unit in back with a wonderful brick courtyard. I didn’t need the extra bedroom but loved having the spacious living room…the internet was much faster than I’m accustomed to on the road and practically used it the whole time I was there. I recommend this Airbnb."

Stayed with a pet","I loved this house SO MUCH!! Everything about my stay was absolutely perfect. From the moment that I walked in, the house was even more beautiful and spacious than expected, and I kinda wished that I didn't have any plans so I could have spent more time enjoying it. I loved the location—a short drive to a bunch of hip restaurants, the furnishings are brand spanking new and gorgeous, the beds and linens were super comfortable, the kitchen was perfectly equipped, and the interior courtyard was ideal for my two dogs to have a safe place to romp for a bit. And Nic was ever the helpful host...making sure I had everything I needed and was readily available. I loved my stay here and will be looking to book again the next time I'm in Reno. Thank you, Nic!!!"

Stayed with a pet","Amazing place to stay!!!! Cannot recommend this highly enough. Super clean, really really well decorated and so comfortable. We absolutely loved our stay here. Really great location, just a couple blocks from the river walk and local coffee shops and restaurants. Felt like coming home. The kitchen has beautiful natural light and the living room and bedrooms are very cozy and inviting. The patio has a fenced yard which was great for our pup. The check in was super easy and Nicolas was very helpful and responsive. Unbelievable value for what you get!! Very clean washer dryer in the basement. If you are looking for a place to stay in Reno, look no further."

Stayed one night","Levi was an incredible host and quick to get back to us if there were any problems (Really the only problem was the power went out a couple of times but it was only related to the wind which is well known in the area!). The Dish was a cute and small house, perfect for 2 people. Date nights for couples (especially with the jacuzzi behind it), or maybe you have a concert to go to and live a bit away from Reno, like my wife and I (we live 50miles away) and you want a quick and easy place to stay. Or even just a weekend away in a relaxing and quiet neighborhood where you dont even have to leave the house. It's very close to Midtown and Downtown where there are so many places for food and romantic or fun activities. I would DEFINITELY recommend Levi and The Dish to anyone!"

I unfortunately got sick at the end of my trip and accidentally left behind some valuables. Jenifer was very understanding and was very pleasant even though I needed her to send me a Fed Ex package with my belongings after my stay (Sorry about that). We would definitely stay here again as we liked the location, property and Jenifer. Thanks for a great stay!"

You’ve got your own bathroom directly across the way from the bedroom. The bed and pillows are out of this world, and I’m not just saying that because of an already fantastic host. 10/10 I’ll definitely be back."

Nice bed and bedding for a good nights sleep. Bathroom is nice and your own to use. The layout of where the bedroom and bathroom is makes for a lot of privacy. Location is excellent and very close (5 minute drive, 15 walking distance) to Peppermill, Atlantis, restaurants and even the movie theater. We will definitely consider staying here again."

My shower was nice and hot and private and the bedroom had my own TV and super comfortable mattress. I slept like a log! He had a beautiful Christmas tree in the living room. It was just great!

All the amenities needed for a short visit and plenty of room for two. Spacious bathroom, comfy bed and everything was super clean. Fun decor theme! The neighborhood was quiet and felt super safe; off-street parking was definitely a plus, though there is plenty of street parking around. James and Jillian were super responsive before and during our stay. We are definitely planning to return!"

Stayed a few nights","I would suggest reading other reviews, as all the information has already been shared by others. I just didn't read it carefully. If you are looking for just a place to spend the night and not spend any time in the room, this is the place. The tenants on the upper level would get noisy sometimes late at night (11pm and after), the walls are paper thin so you hear everything. This is not a high traffic area otherwise it would be much worse. I received clear instructions for check in/out, never had any issues so there was no need to further communicate with my host. There is NO hair dryer so come prepared for that."

Stayed a few nights","Earle and Lorraine were fantastic hosts! Their place was absolutely charming, clean, and perfectly located for our needs. They were incredibly responsive throughout our stay, answering any questions we had quickly and efficiently.
The unit itself offered plenty of amenities and was conveniently located to The Convention Center. The only minor things to note for future guests, (and certainly not dealbreakers for us), were the stairs leading down to the unit, which were a bit long and on the steeper side, and the use of a traditional key instead of a keypad for entry. Unfortunately, one night we used the wrong lock and came back late from volleyball to find we locked ourselves out. Thankfully, Earle and Lorraine were very accommodating and resolved the situation quickly. Their hospitality truly went above and beyond!
Overall, we had a wonderful stay at Earle and Lorraine's place. They are fantastic hosts, and we highly recommend their charming studio."

Stayed over a week","This is someone home not built to be an apartment, hotel or anything else, the walls and ceiling are paper thin so you can hear there washer going all day and night (they usually keep it going all day and pretty late) and their bathroom is located somewhere over the bed so you can hear that too. The water heater isn’t big if someone else decides to take a long shower you have to deal with no hot water.
The fridge is horrible either everything is frozen or your ice cream is melting, no in between. Lot of noise from the apartments nearby, there was graffiti on there hand rail walking down to my front door, then once you got down there the shade covering the fence is peeling back in a few places just felt really trashy. And sorta disgusted me when my friends had to drop me off there. The two host were very understanding and nice and responded in a mannerly time. They provide everything you need to get through your stay."

I really appreciated the option of a washer/dryer set on site, even though I ended up not needing it. The little offerings on the table and complimentary coffee were a nice touch, and I mostly enjoyed the smart TV and apps for my downtime spent in the room. It helped pass the time quite nicely. Room was centrally located to all the places I needed to go, and if I make it back to Reno, I will check for the availability here first. Thank you again for the warm and welcoming accommodations."

The apartments next door were a little loud and I could h hear the people walking around upstairs all the time. I got the place because it was walking distance to Peppermill and it wasn’t expensive. Everything on the inside was nice and clean. He had everything I would have needed if I decided to cook. I would stay there again.

The location was very close to the Peppermill, which is where I was attending a conference, although the neighborhood is a little noisy. It calmed down early for my stay on all but one night, and I would speculate it might have been louder to stay at the hotel. Host communication is good and you can tell they really care. Overall I would recommend (especially if you have things to do nearby), and I would stay here again if I'm ever in Reno in the future."

Stayed one night","Earle’s place was an adequate place to stay in for the one night I was in town.
Location was great for us as we wanted to be near the Convention Center and airport. The neighborhood wasn’t the best, but the unit was inside facing and quiet. I felt safe, but opted to drive instead of walk around the area.
Check in process was a breeze. There are stairs you need to go down to get to the unit.
Inside, the place was very clean and had plenty space for me and my husband. Shower, toilet and sink were a bit small in size. Overall it was a motel/basement vibe, and not in a bad way.
The internet was knocked out during our stay and our Verizon and ATT phone receptions did not work down there either, which meant we couldn’t use their Roku TV or our phones. They did offer to send someone over right away that evening, but we declined since we were only there for a bit.
There was an AC window unit that was pretty loud when it would click on at night and it didn’t work as hard as my husband would’ve like, so we didn’t sleep well even with me having ear plugs. I would recommend keeping the fan on instead of the ac unit for consistent white noise.
It’s unfortunate, but I think if there wasn’t a heat wave and if we had working internet our stay would’ve been more pleasurable, but those were just the circumstances we were given, and I bet this unit would’ve been a great stay otherwise."

It was a short 15 minute walk to the conference center and even closer to the two main hotels (Atlantis and Peppermill), so when I had enough of conferencing I could slip away to this nice, quiet island of comfort and serenity. The hosts were welcoming and attentive and the place was sparkling."

This property is very up dated and clean! The Hosts are amazing! They made sure that they were available if we needed anything at all. We will be renting this property again!

Stayed one night","Great location! 3 min to casinos, comfy bed and everything you need for a short stay. Great communication. There is an Apple
Tree in the parking lot with lots of apples! Great water pressure in the shower. Will be back!"
