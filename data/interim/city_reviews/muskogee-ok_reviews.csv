Stayed with kids","Rebecca was incredible. From the moment we reserved until after we checked out she was responsive and caring. Her instructions and welcome were intentional and specific.
The house was beautifully done. High quality materials, didn’t cut corners. I think it is more beautiful than the pictures show.
We would stay here again in a heartbeat!"

Stayed a few nights","this place is awesome, definitely a steal for the money. it's freshly remodeled and not a single detail was overlooked. We travel all over for work and I can honestly say that this was the nicest home we ever stayed in. Rebecca was an amazing host, good local recommendations that were spot on and made sure all of our needs were met. We will book again when back in town for sure!!!"

Stayed with kids","Overall a good stay - everything was as described and it was a seamless check-in/check-out process. The location was nice and quiet and was exactly what we needed for our stay. We had easy access to the various places we went around town. I would only suggest that a couple of the older mattresses be replaced. Some of us didn't get great sleep from the older mattresses that made a lot of noise. But overall, we would stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","In town for a wedding. Beautiful older home. Felt comfortable and safe. Nice and quiet neighborhood. We will definitely stay here again when in the area.
We couldn’t get coffee pot to work but no biggie we door dashed coffee. Easy access to the everything in Muskogee. Will be recommended to anyone. Clean, safe, comfortable. The master bed was very comfortable.
No bedroom TVs wasn’t a big deal to me but my husband wished there was one."

Stayed a few nights","It was a great place for the price. Only a few things we disliked. walking in, it was kind of a musty smell to the house but it’s an older house so it’s to be expected. Everything was pretty clean. There was only a few stains on the couch and on the rug. The location was great right in the middle of town. Bed was pretty comfortable and clean. It’s advertised to have a coffee bar but the coffee pot was broken. There was no lid to the water Reservoir and they were just a few K cups and out of creamer. I love the farmhouse, charm interior design. They let us check out later, which was appreciated. I definitely would recommend this place for a small family to stay for the weekend while in Muskogee.❤️"

Stayed a few nights","Was not as clean as expected. Particularly the floors and the air vent it the bathroom was covered in dust. Master bed was comfortable, but the other 3 beds were not and creaked terribly with every move. My 70 year old mother ended up sleeping on the couch the second night. Rusty water coming out of tub and bathroom faucet when first turned in. We brushed our teeth with bottled water. Also porch light didn’t work so coming back at night it was very dark outside."

Stayed with kids","There were both pros and cons to staying here.
Pros: The house was nice. It’s a good place to stay. It feels like home. Nice big TV and the coffee pot is awesome.
Cons: towels and wash cloths are on the cheaper side. Very small and kinda rough in texture. Shower water pressure could have been better. The kitchen light didn’t work besides the light above the sink. The porch light didn’t work. The outlets are a bit outdated in some areas and only have 2 prongs vs 3. I put a gallon of milk in the refrigerator and the entire shelf came crashing down. Some mattresses are on the firm side, not bad just not super comfortable.
The big things are done very well and look great. Just a few smaller things that could have been done better or upgraded.
Overall it’s a good stay."

---
The house was clean, tastefully decorated, and appeared freshly remodeled. The TV in the living room was very large and we really felt at home with the extra large dining room table and nice furniture. There was even charcoal for the grill which we used for dinner one evening which was very nice. The main bed was very comfortable.
The bath towels were very small and rough. The kitchen only had wine glasses and no regular cups or glass to drink from. The refrigerator makes a loud humming noise when it's in cooling mode. The light on the front porch doesn't illuminate well, and the light in the dining room was very dim as well. The twin beds were just average. The daybed should only be used by a child as it is very thin and not comfortable for an adult."

Great place to stay as a family, our girls (4 and 8) had ample space to play and they loved the thoughtful books and games placed in one of the rooms, especially The Wonky Donkey book. (Lol!) This house is located in a peaceful and quiet neighborhood with very friendly neighbors and had everything we needed during our stay visiting family. We will be back again!

Stayed with a pet","On a scale of 10, this place rates a 9.99. It's excellent in every way except one tiny thing, and that only applies if you have a bigger dog. The back yard is fully fenced and secure, but's it's on the smaller side. Our dog loves to chase balls, and there just wasn't enough room to do that. There is a great neighborhood to walk in, though, so you and the dog can still stretch and work off energy. Other than that particular comment, this place is perfect."

When we arrived, the only issue we had was with GPS. So, if you have any problems and it looks like it’s sending you the wrong way, Ignore it! You can’t go far because it’s only 2 cul-de-sacs🙂
As soon as you walk in, it is very roomy and cozy! You’ll feel right at home. You’ll appreciate all of the notes Jenni placed out for you. Internet, House Rules and Dining suggestions are placed are posted for your convenience. Love The Coffee Bar!!! If you want to relax outside, you’ll love the backyard🦫🌲🌿🐦‍⬛
No Shoes inside! My sister found out one of-the reasons why! She walked then pranced across the front grass barefoot! 😣 Little stickers in the grass🙈 Don’t want to bring them inside! We laughed about it later😂 I suggest bringing some socks or little slippers to walk around the house.
Overall, this was such a wonderful place to stay! If we ever come back to Muskogee, we would definitely come back to Jenni’s house 🏡"

Jenni went above and beyond to communicate that she was available to assist in any way. the house was very clean and was stocked with any household item you could need.
The outdoor space was great for my dogs, as well as a great spot to relax by the fire pit. The location worked great for my visit and will stay again in the future!"

Stayed with a pet","This was a return visit for us and same as last visit, everything was wonderful. The neighborhood is so peaceful and out of the way but close to amenities. The house was well stocked and so clean. The beds are comfortable and the air works great, especially in these summer months. You will only have to bring yourself, clothes, and food. My husband and I had our vow renewal on the back deck and the games worked well keeping the kids who attended occupied! The neighbors on both sides have dogs, I say this because our dog was interested but the fence helps with separation so there were no issues. The table, fire pit, and hammock are so nice to enjoy on summer evenings. This is such a great place and Jenni is so accommodating! We can’t wait to come back!"

Stayed about a week","This listing is amazing! Jenni is one of the best and made sure all was going as planned. The house was very clean, updated, and well stocked! The amenities were great and there are too many extras to name at this house. I always carry all my necessities but everything I would have needed was there! Literally- you would only need to bring yourself, clothes, and food! The bed was so comfortable and the pillows were amazing after long days! The neighborhood is close to essentials but tucked away and so quiet. The neighbors are friendly. All the neighbors have dogs of all sizes, so if you travel with pets, be aware- but this house had great tall fencing so we had no issues. Our stay was comfortable and I cannot wait to book again! Thank you so much Jenni!
10 of 10 - would absolutely recommend!"

The backyard is perfect; corn hole, a hammock, large back porch with a table and umbrella and a fire pit. There’s a closet with plenty of games, a roku tv in the living room and master bedroom. If you do plan to bring a dog, beware that the houses on each side of the fence have dogs as well (it wasn’t a problem for us, but a heads up for someone it might be). Overall it was a great experience and we will be coming back again. We loved our stay, we were very entertained the whole time while still getting to relax and enjoy our visit! Definitely recommend!"

Group trip","From checking in, all the way to checking out I had an easy and comfortable experience. The check in process for this house is one of the easiest I have seen. The house itself was extremely clean and had top shelf accommodations. The living room was well decorated and gave a lively feeling to the house as a whole. Connected to the living room was the kitchen area. The kitchen area was spacious and gave my friends and I more than enough room to cook meals and eat.
All The bedrooms where crisp and clean. The bedrooms ranged in size but never In quality, all three where great.
My favorite part about my stay was the backyard area. As soon as you walk outside you are greeted with an outside patio with a beautiful table and seats to sit around in. The backyard also had a fire pit and firewood.
After staying at this Air BnB I can confirm that it’s an absolutely gorgeous place to stay and I would recommend it to anyone! ."

Everything was well maintained and very clean. The beds were so comfortable, it even had a king size bed which is hard to come across. It had an awesome coffee bar which was a big hit for our family. The backyard was my favorite spot, with corn hole and a huge jenga game that kept the kids busy. She also had games to entertain us and the kids.

We will definitely return for a longer stay.

Stayed with kids","Indeed the place has a feel of suburb (away from crowd places), yet it very close distant to business (fast food, grocery store, etc).
The facility is a way (10 times) better than a hotel room or even a hotel suit. Why?? Things NOT provided by Hotel: Propane BBQ grill (with wheels), 2 swing sets, domino (table games). 2 lawn chairs with fire pit sits on the open fields, to say the least, for guest's enjoyment.
You will not regret to even just stay (half) a day. You will definitely change your mind and will want to stay 2 x 24 hours. If so, immediately contact the SuperHost, hopefully no one reserves your wish (last minute change) to stay on 2nd nite. SuperHost is very responsive.
it's a family oriented place, handicapped accessible, concrete 2 car parking are so closed to the entrance door. Very convenient. It feels like a 'second house for a get away from home'. it exceeds our expectation. We will come back at stay again in the future.

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I were in town for my high school reunion. I was drawn to Chris's place, as I knew from childhood that the area was lovely and quiet. Add to that the size of the unit - like a decent-sized apartment - and we further knew that we'd likely enjoy our stay there. Boy, did we! Everything was as advertised and easy to navigate. As others have noted, it's a bit tricky to find the first time, but after doing so, we loved the charm of the entry drive. All in all, a beautiful, natural setting.
Chris was quick to respond to the few questions I messaged him about, but never bugged us about anything during our stay. In that regard, silence is golden - and much appreciated. The covered parking was a plus, as the days were still quite warm during this visit. Thanks for that!
All in all, a very fine visit made all the better by our stay at Chris's beautiful unit. I'd recommend the place to anyone and everyone!
Thanks,
Rodger and Barbara"

Host even left muffins out which were absolutely delicious 😋 Even though we got in late and the correct place on the property was a little worrisome to find in the dark (I did not realize there were two driveways on the property-- not a big deal) Christopher responded promptly and was extremely gracious and friendly. Things to keep in mind : be sure to pull the back door firmly and make sure it latches and because of the location it is extremely quiet (which was heaven for us). If total silence is unsettling/hard to sleep with for you, might want to bring a fan or other quiet white noise device to help offset"

It was easy to drive past after dark (and Apple Maps had it pinned at the wrong place), but it was a piece of cake to find after that. It’s in a quiet part of town with plenty of yard space, and the interior is really well decorated. My wife took notes, and we’ll be taking some cues from this place!
The bed was cozy, the appliances all ran like new, and we had no issues with the wifi. Christopher even left out a few snacks on the coffee and kitchen tables that we gladly took advantage of! It’s completely outside of the owner’s control, but cell service inside the house was almost non-existent (we’re on T-Mobile). The wifi made that way less of an issue though!"

Stayed with kids","Christopher perfectly described this guest suite. First of all, I’d like to say he was an honest and responsive host. Check in was not until 3pm, however, Christopher reached out to me several hours prior to our check in time due to his previous guest. He let me know that they had some issues and that they were working on getting everything resolved. However, due to the extra cleanup he had to do as well as our knowledge of the situation, he offered to put us up in a nearby hotel or he would compensate our stay if we chose to still check in. We decided that we would still stay at Honor Heights regardless. None of this affected our check in time. When we arrived, the suite was spotless despite the issues they had had with a previous guest. Christopher sent us our refund and apologized for the situation, which was no fault of his. I’d just like to say that a lot of people would not even be upfront and honest about a mess that a previous person had left. Christopher is an impeccable host!"

Stayed with kids","My Family and I stayed at this property during an overnight stop on a family road trip from Arkansas to Denver. We had to make an unplanned stop due to travel delays from a snow storm leaving Denver. After looking at several hotels in the area we found this rental on the airbnb app and the price, even with all of the fees, was about the same as a hotel. We were extremely pleased with the property, proximity to the turnpike and the neighboorhood. We had covered parking right at the front door and plenty of room for everyone to spread out.
After hours of traffic and being cramped in a car together it was way better than any small hotel room. The property was exceptionally clean and comfortable and had everything a person would need for an even longer stay. Highly recommend!"

The hosts were friendly, responsive, and extremely accommodating. The home was immaculate, and I'm very picky on cleanliness and this was 5-star cleanliness on every level. The home and furnishings were updated and beautiful. Right down the street is a playground and skate park, where the kids and I walked to daily! The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. I recommend visiting AB Coffee House right down the street as well! Thank you Anna and Alissa for sharing your beautiful home with us! We would definitely stay here again!"

Most airbnbs show a lot of wear/tear but this home has been very well cared for. First bedroom was perfect for our kids. They had bins of toys which my kids loved. The privacy fence looks new. My kids loved their cornhole set they had in the outside bin. They had 2 living rooms which were comfortable. The kitchen literally has every single thing one would need to cook a meal. They provided a keurig with kpod coffee. There are a ton of cleaning supplies & laundry detergent for the washing machine. Love the decor! We ate at Charlie’s Chicken (delicious), Subway, & McDonalds. There are more restaurants about 20 minutes away in Muskogee. Harps is the local grocery store & it’s as nice as a Publix. We visited the playground down the street. Very cute area! Very clean! I would stay again!"

Furniture was well spaced for youngsters. Our 3 yr and 9 month old cruised everywhere without concern! Also our tween was very pleased she had her “own area to close the door with starry lights”.
We relaxed, cooked, played games (twister and dominoes were our favs) even watched a little Netflix before bed. Saturday evening on our way back in from visiting family we enjoyed our short drive over to the Garden of Lights in Muskogee.
It felt as though you thought of every little detail and implemented it so delicately soft blankets, pillows, lighting with wireless chargers, and lights/fans with remotes! I could keep going but overall what I am saying is we were just so pleased with the abundance of accommodations provided to meet our family needs that we didn’t necessarily even think about prior to arrival."

Stayed with kids","We were looking to stay somewhere over the holidays with our baby while visiting family. We weren’t looking to be in the home too much, but when we were it would have been nicer had there been a couple of things changed. The neighbors have a very bright pole light stuck to their facia right outside the bedroom window, which with a little one isn’t ideal. There was an issue with roaches while we were there. My husband killed four, one on my plate on the coffee table, two in the kitchen, and one in the bathroom. We didn’t feel good about leaving formula and clean bottles out on the kitchen counter. I think it’s the fact that the home is older and isn’t sealed up incredibly well around plumbing. Overall the cleanliness was actually good. I don’t want anyone to think the cleaning service isn’t doing their job because that wasn’t the issue at all. Some positives were that it’s easy to find and the mini splits work great. Has a lot of dishes and things you may need."

Only downfall we had was we both had to drive to event and driveway was told that it was shared to stay on right side but family who shares the driveway tends to take the driveway which left us to park on the street one night and partially in street the following night. The street luckily is wide and allows room for parked cars , otherwise everything is as described. Home is farther away from main area of town so depending on location of what your visiting area for could be a thought but as for retro and being a cute setup that all is very good."

Stayed a few nights","This small older home is decorated in a cute retro manner but didn’t hide various cleanliness & renovation issues. The living room floor is extremely soft in some areas & laundry room floor slopes. Tiles in bathroom don’t meet the wall near the toilet & there was mold on the floor trim & shower curtain liner. Blinds in bathroom & bedroom were filthy. Toilet flushing was problematic. Outside garbage bin was overflowing. Some kitchen items felt greasy. Bring your own shower toiletries, dish soap, laundry detergent. What was provided was minimal or nonexistent. Only 2 towel sets available for 3 people. Positives: The washer & dryer are very nice, water pressure for showers is perfect, hair dryer is powerful, queen bed is comfortable, & AC units in every room. Neighborhood was relatively quiet & we felt safe. Hosts kindly accommodated a late checkout & responded immediately to all texts. Recommend posting instructions for turning on shower head and location of bedding for sofa."

Stayed one night","This is a great place. If you have an appointment at the Muskogee VA Hospital, this is literally within a 30 second drive. The house appears to be old, so it looks old and smells old. The neighborhood appears to be old too. The floor from the living room into the bedroom is uneven. I asked the owners to consider having it repaired as it could be a safety issue. There are 2 nice smart TV's, one in the living room and one in the bedroom, but no premium streaming channels included, and no way to watch local channels with an antennae. If you are not sure about old pipes, you may want to bring your own water. Be aware that you are asked to take out your own trash too."

Stayed with a pet","Such a cute property with much character. It was conveniently located 10 minutes from downtown and within walking distance to the VA hospital and Palmer Park.
The stackable w/d were great to have.
The long dressing mirror was a plus since I was in Muskogee for business, and I could check my outfit before leaving in the morning.
The abundant supply of Keurig coffee pods was wonderful! (I brought my own ground coffee but forgot the reusable filter.)
Being pet friendly is an automatic 5 stars!! My fur baby traveled with me, and we had great walks on the sidewalk to the park.
The fenced yard was great to have for my dog, but the yard doesn't have a gate.
In my opinion, improvements for future guests would be to have a working porch light for evening returns and in-home instructions of how to work the subscription-based TV (no live local channels) and H/A system.
I will recommend this property to coworkers and look forward to staying here again."

The house is very charming, nestled in a pre/post-war era neighborhood and a lovely walking distance to Honor Heights Park (A must see if you are visiting from out of town). We look forward to using them again."

Stayed with kids",Richard and Becky were absolutely amazing from the first inquiry I sent about staying in their home. This was my first Airbnb experience and Iwill be telling EVERYONE about Richard and Becky. They respond immediately at any time with anything you need or if you have questions. They are such generous and kind spirited people. Not only can you tell that by the interactions you have with them via messages but you can tell that through the vibes you get in their adorable home. I could go on and on about how lovely the interior is decorated but you just HAVE to go check it out yourself. it's modern but retro and.... well just go check it out. it's an adorable home. it's so relaxing and you won't want to leave. we will definitely be back to stay again.

Stayed one night","This is a cute updated vintage house in what seemed to be a nicer area of Muskogee, based on appearances. It's very close the the Castle and the Amish store, two of our favorite places in town. We couldn't get the shower to turn on, but that may just have been us not figuring it out. Loved all the friendly cats outside.
The only major complaint we have was the inability to sleep. It's mentioned in the house rules 3 times to be quiet after 10pm to not upset the neighbors. Yet the neighbors to the left of the house, the side where the bedroom is, blasted music until after 11pm. Then continued to be loud until after 1:23am. Yes, I kept checking the clock because I couldn't sleep. It's like they were sitting next to the window in the driveway. We were gone for hours before bed so it's not like we were noisy first. I think your guests aren't the problem, host.
If not for the neighbors I'd stay here again."

They accommodated us on our first night by allowing us to check in 1 hour before. We were very thankful because we had been on the road for 21+ hours, non stop driving to Muskogee. You can’t go wrong with this stay!"

Stayed a few nights","This little cottage is so cute. Sooo 1950's. The furnishings are replicas but mostly accurate in keeping with the time period. The outside of the house needs some refreshing and curb appeal but the inside is clean and neat as a pin. We have suggested to the host that they get some heavier curtains because the sheer curtains, bright outdoor lights and close neighbors left us feeling exposed. We would definitely stay there again. Be sure to check out the Butterfly Pavillion at Honor Heights Park and we also enjoyed the Oklahoma Aquarium that was about 45 minutes away."

We did have trouble even finding and getting into the house, but thankfully, Richard answered the phone in the middle of the night to help us figure out how to get inside. We loved all the retro touches throughout the place! it definitely added character and Southern charm. Everything was clean and was nice for the couple days that we were there. We were not able to properly take showers though, as the shower head was loose and seemed to not be attached to the tub portion, so that was quite unfortunate. It may be helpful for future guests if the location on Google maps is updated- as it takes you to the wrong house!"

Group trip","This property is AMAZING! The cabin comfortably accommodated my family of 9. There was something for everyone to do to stay occupied. There were games, movies, fishing, trails and so much more. The cabin is so beautiful and clean inside. Nick does extra things to help you feel at home, like the s’mores package, fire wood, propane for the grill, extra grocery items in case you forgot something. We will definitely be staying here again!"

Group trip","This place is fantastic! The host had excellent communication before and after our stay and the house is very well stocked! We really enjoyed the s’mores gear and had a great time around the fire. The bed was very comfortable and there is lots of space.
I can’t say enough about the property either— it rained one night we were there and the next day there was a beautiful stream running down to the pond near by.
I’d absolutely book this again if I’m back in the area!"

Stayed with kids",This place was amazing. It is very secluded and a beautiful property. The cabin was well stocked with everything you need and more. The cabin is very clean and comfortable. My young kids were always entertained with the abundance of toys and activities provided and the enchanted forest pure magic for my 2 young daughters. Communication was very pleasant with Nick and he was great to deal with. We will no doubt be coming back here on a regular basis.

Stayed with kids","WOW!!! What an amazing place to stay. Absolutely everything was the way it was described. Extremely clean and cozy. I highly recommend this place to anyone with kids. My daughters favorite part was the fairy forest. We went through it like 5 times. We saw plenty of wild life like, deer, bald eagle,s snakes, and lizards. We did not want to leave!!! . Also if you want to fish there is a boat ramp that is 8 minutes from the house. We are already planning another trip to nicks house.."

The fire pit was amazing! Nick knows just what you will need! The place is well stocked with everything you might need! We stayed a week and only ate out twice. We found the kitchen to be fully stocked. Our family made some great memories!"

Group trip","This was the best experience with the most communicative host. The entire property is very well maintained and beautiful. The beds were very comfortable with plenty of extra clean linens and there were many many options for activities, both indoor and outdoor. Sitting around the fire pit was the perfect way to end the night. They have thought of everything and provided plenty amenities for their guests. We will definitely be returning!!"

Stayed with kids",Beautiful cabin on 40 acres. Love the old but new look. Comfy beds and lush towels. Lots of indoor and outdoor games. We loved exploring the trails and axe throwing. The evening fire and s’mores were the perfect end to our evenings.

Stayed with kids","Nick’s place was absolutely fantastic for us. It was exactly as described with great trails so we were able to get outside and just relax for a couple of days. They have thought of everything in the cabin and the S’mores setup was the icing on the cake. Nick was proactive and sent us lots of tips which was also wonderful.
The only thing that could be improved is the Wi-Fi… and when you’re just enjoying yourself in nature does it really matter? Probably not!
Great place, highly recommend and hope to be back soon!"

Group trip",Nick couldn’t have been any better from the communication to accommodating our early arrival and being so generous to let us have a late check out without us even asking. The tiny details the place provided that weren’t expected but great to discover was amazing . I’ll be coming back and this will be one of the first airbnbs i would recommend for anybody who asks. Thank you again nick for making our new years unforgettable

Stayed with kids","We had a wonderful stay celebrating Christmas with our family. Nick was prompt and helpful in communicating. It was obvious the hosts had been quite attentive to the details that made our stay very enjoyable. The outdoor space, including the trails, pond and games, provided a great opportunity for the kids to play outside. The adults enjoyed drinking tea on the back porch and we all loved sitting around the campfire roasting marshmallows and sharing stories. The kitchen was very well equipped, allowing us to eat meals at the cabin without hauling much in. Muskogee was close enough to run in for dinner and see the beautiful display at the Garden of Lights. The highlight was being together at the cabin in a space that accommodated comfort and all the things that make vacation so relaxing and special, like long baths, campfires, cozy bedding and beautiful views."

Stayed with kids","My family and I booked Nick’s cabin for a weekend to spend some quality time together and it couldn’t have been more perfect.
The beds alone are worth the reservation, so comfy! We spent every night out by the fire pit (we put a significant dent in the firewood Nick so kindly left us)
We spend hours around that fire, the teenagers even put their phones away to make s’mores and partake in spooky story telling lol. We’re already thinking about planning another trip.
The property is extremely private, you really feel way more secluded than it even is, it was the perfect location. We went into town for some pizzas one night and it only took about 15 to get to the domino’s.
We had plenty to do with all the games Nick left, corn hole, ax throwing, board games inside, and more. I would recommend this to anyone looking for some good rest and beautiful views."

Stayed with kids","What a peaceful getaway! This cabin is just beautiful, surrounded my 40 acres of land. My children spent hours exploring the trails and really enjoyed finding the fairies hidden throughout the forest. Nick was very accommodating and quick to respond to any questions we had. He was even flexible with our check out time which was extremely helpful. The cabin was very clean, the beds were really comfortable and the kitchen was stocked with any appliance you might need as well as kitchen essentials. They even included a little smore pack to enjoy by the fire pit. I highly recommend this cabin if you are looking for a restful retreat not far from OKC. We will definitely be back to stay again."

Stayed one night","The property was more than I imagined it to be. It was such a wonderful escape from the city for the weekend. I always feel like I’m really getting away when it’s dark enough at night to see tons of stars, and that’s what we got. Just the sounds of the frogs in the pond and the crackling of the fire. Hiking the trails and searching for animal tracks in the morning was so much fun. The cabin had everything we needed. I’m always picky about the beds in an Airbnb. These were great. We had a really great time and would definitely stay again."
