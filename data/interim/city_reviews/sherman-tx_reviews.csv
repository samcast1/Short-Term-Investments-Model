Stayed with kids","I took my family to Grayson Grove for a quick getaway to go check out Sherman Texas. Everything that was described in the post was either spot on, or better! Grayson Grove was so enchanting and pleasant, I really can’t say enough about the property I was so impressed. It was beautiful being able to cook in the kitchen and open the blinds to watch the Geese and ducks out on the gorgeous pond, to taking a nice sanctuary stroll on the 30 acres. We didn’t even get to explore the entire property. As far as Amanda, you won’t find a better host. When we arrived I had a few questions and they were answered immediately, instructions were spot on and she even gave us recommendations on where to shop and eat. My family and I are already planning to go back in the summer. This property really does check all the boxes. Can’t wait to go back, and big thanks to Amanda for being a 5 star host!!!!"

Stayed a few nights","Our stay was wonderful. The house was lovely and very well-suited to my family's needs. The entire house was spotless, well-equipped and comfortable. The kitchen and living area were so perfect for cooking and catching up with our kids. It was close enough to the Metroplex that they could easily drive out and spend time with the old folks! The grounds are just pristine - so beautiful to look out of the many windows and see nothing but nature. We were so close to everything we needed, but still out in the country. I'm so appreciative of being able to travel with our pups also. Amanda's place was everything we'd hoped it would be."

Stayed with a pet","The house was great and the property was beautiful! We enjoyed the quiet area and peaceful surroundings. The outdoor patios were wonderful, if the weather had been cooler we would have sat there most of our stay. We enjoyed the indoors with the shuffleboard and movies. The house was able to accommodate us well with enough space to spread out. If we are ever in the area again we would definitely stay again! We may come back in the fall just to enjoy the outdoor space in cooler temperatures."

Group trip",I wanted to stay at a place where we all could spend a lot of time outdoors. I wanted to be able to walk with all of our dogs. Amanda’s place was perfect. The property was secluded and green. Lots of trees and wildflowers. Our dogs loved every minute as did we. The house is very very nice. Lots of windows and light. The hot tub area with the outdoor shower was so convenient to bathe the dogs after they would run through the fields and then head to the ponds. Some really nice touches throughout the house. We are wanting to go back in the fall.

The property was HUGE , spent our mornings fishing in the pond and our evenings exploring the property. We made great use of the fire pit and jacuzzi. If you’d like to get away from the busy city life this is the perfect stop. 11/10 would definitely recommend"

Amanda provided plenty of kitchen utensils, dishes, pots, etc. so that you can have great homemade food.
The house is modern.
Guest should be aware that the wi-fi is slow and doesn’t always work. So, don’t plan on working a lot on your computer.
The water pressure change or shut off if you use the dishwasher.
We loved our stay and will book again."

Stayed a few nights","Me and my family live on the move and we had gotten tired of hotels. Seen this place in Airbnb and figured what the heck it could be nice to settle down in an actual home for a long weekend! Boy were we right and the home was pleasant throughout the only thing that got me was the bathroom behind the laundry area. There was a thick rise on the door threshold that I beaned my toes on. However that aside, it was an awesome experience to stay in a quiet neighborhood and just relax! I hope to stay there again in the future as it was just like walking in to your own home! Thank you tk the team that put that together! You don’t know how appreciative we are!"

We were in town for a softball tournament (a great location to get to the fields), and we appreciated that the air was turned down to be nice and cool on this 105+ weekend. We also appreciated the ice maker. My daughter also liked the basket of goodies. We've stayed at a number of rental homes, and this one was definitely among some of the best."

Stayed with kids","This was probably one of my BEST Air bnb investments!! Seriously. My family needed a place to stay during an out of town work event, and this was perfect. Full kitchen, full bathrooms, ample living/lounge areas, and there were even many amenities for our little ones that we were not expecting, but were a huge blessing, as we did not have room to pack these items before our trip (toys, games, pack n play, baby bathtub, etc.). The home is beautiful, was very clean, and smelled amazing when we arrived. The hosts were very communicative beforehand and during our stay, and very prompt to respond to messages. Again, it was perfect for us and we will absolutely plan to book here again for all of our future stays in the area!"

For those with dogs, the fence is being updated for more privacy. It was about 95% completed when we arrived. Due to the rainy weather + mud, my dog wasn’t able to enjoy the backyard as much but we’re hoping to return soon.
I definitely recommend this place whether you’re traveling solo or with someone, and for its cleanliness especially being pet-friendly."

Stayed with kids",This is 10 out of 10 best of all little tiny house. I would recomment that is look tiny from the outside but inside is look bigger for me and it's beautiful everything in the picture look old but they all new and nice inside. They renew so much stuff inside the house and they have everything you need to cook or have cup of tea every morning.

Communication was quick and I loved the guidebook that gives you all the information you need to know for your stay with some history of the farm and Sherman. Definitely will have this place bookmarked for any future stays in Sherman.

The house was so cute and clean upon our arrival. We were in town to visit our son during his college homecoming and he even let us bring our teenage daughter (slept on a blow-up bed in the living room) so she could see her brother also. After we went out to dinner, David had a bonfire for us so we could enjoy the beautiful, quiet country and family time. We can't wait to return!"

The location feels totally secluded but it's a short hop to the freeway taking you wherever you need. Check-in is easy peasy and the one question we did ask during our stay, David answered super fast. We absolutely recommend Ponder Farm :)"

Stayed with a pet",Nice property to stay for one or two people for a casino trip or someone working in town short term. It has a nice private yard and patio area. Located on a busy highway so there is some road noise and house number is hard to read from the road. If you are coming Hwy 69 North from South of Denison it will be on the left side of the road before you get into Denison. Teresa was very responsive in helping me find the property. Will likely stay again if in the area

She had easy and clear instructions how to get in. The place was beautiful, big bag yard for the doggy that tagged along with me. The description of the place was spot on to what was described, and worth the price. We even had to stay last minute and deal with a family issue, and needed to stay an extra day. Teresa was understanding and allowed us to stay and pay for another night.
Thank you again for everything. We will definitely use your Airbnb if it’s available again when we travel back to Texas."

We stayed at a hotel the night before, upper scale one, this place was cleaner hands down. It is close to the highway, so you will hear traffic. It didn’t bother me personally, but my husband had a little bit of trouble. The only 2 things I would recommend is a king bed and black out curtains to help you sleep in and maybe help with the sound of traffic. We will most definitely stay there again. Thank you for sharing your studio apartment with us."

Stayed a few nights","I had the pleasure of having Balaji as our host for a recent gender reveal party. Balaji was simply outstanding - welcoming, responsive, and ever attentive to our needs, which made our event run smoothly.
The property itself was beyond beautiful. The rooms were spotless and spacious, perfect for accommodating our group comfortably. The highlight was undoubtedly the large open space, complete with a charming gazebo right in the middle - it served as an ideal backdrop for our celebration.
However, one word of advice for future visitors - do check the weather forecast before booking. The property, due to its vast openness, could be subject to winds, which might require some adjustments in your plans.
All in all, I can't recommend Balaji and his property enough. We had a memorable time and hope to return in the future. His commitment to ensuring a great experience for his guests is truly commendable."

Entertainment was also great with TVs offering streaming content in the living areas while bedrooms were kept peacefully quiet.

We got checked in after dark. placed a grocery order with Instacart which delivered the items right to our door step first thing in the morning. we recommend visiting Schulman's, about a 10 minute drive from the property. it's an all-in-one family place- movies, bowling, restaurant, arcade, bar, rock wall, ropes course and ax throwing."

Group trip","This home was perfect for our gathering. Plenty of open space to catch-up with family and friends. We could put the younger children to bed without worrying about them being awaken with the party that goes into the night. There was even a door in the hallway to close off the noise. We liked that the pool table was away from the living room so it was easy to talk without the rowdiness of the pool players. The kitchen had everything we needed, even coffee. Lovely home, clean and inviting. Balaji is a wonderful host. He was very accommodating and helpful. He was quick to respond to any questions we had. We would definitely recommend his home to anyone and stay there again ourselves."

Cherie went as far as making sure my special dietary needs were met and provided alimony milk for my morning protein shake. Unfortunately, I forgot my shaker and did not have a way to mix it. I am sure I could have asked Cherie for a mason jar or something but with only staying 2 nights, it was not necessary. Loved the variety of snacks. Some that I could enjoy too. I will be shopping where she shops after this stay.
I would recommend this Airbnb.

Cherie even offered a complimentary S'mores kit to enjoy in her relaxing backyard fire pit on New Year's Day. We also enjoyed the chocolates and some other goodies in our room. We slept very comfortable and the place was perfect for our 3-night stay while we visited family in Sherman. Thank you, Cherie! We will definitely consider your place again when we return in the summer."

Stayed over a week","I was in Sherman for a few weeks on contract position at a local hospital, hoping to find a nice quiet place to relax after hectic shifts. The carriage house fit the bill perfectly. Cherie gave great directions on how to find the place since it's situated off the main roads, and self check-in was a breeze. The garden outside is positively beautiful, and I already miss walking outside and smelling the amazing 4ft tall flowers (I think they were canna lilies?) that are right by the door.
Cherie truly went out of her way to make the place feel like a home away from home - the decor is modern yet comfortable, and you can really feel how much care she puts into the place. There is a daily cleaning service during the week which was fantastic, amazing snacks provided in a welcome basket, and even though we worked opposite shifts, she let me know how to reach her if I needed anything.
I don't know that I'll ever be in the area again, but I would absolutely stay at the carriage house studio again. Thank you Cherie!"

She also thoughtfully asked about dietary needs and provided gluten-free and dairy-free items for breakfast. The weather was cold the night we came, and she already had the heater going for us upon arrival. We would definitely return to the Carriage House next time we're in town!"

This was my first official Air B and B experience but my daughter who stayed with me here for the first night said “best Air B and B” experience ever (and she has stayed all over the world). The neighborhood is beautiful, safe and charming. Convenient location to Austin College (in fact it’s closer than any of the local hotels). When I return to Sherman, this will definitely be my first choice. Thanks Cherie!!"

The location was stellar (I stayed here 1 month for work, and worked downtown) and the place was extremely clean and quiet. Cherie has a lovely back yard and was a wonderfully accommodating host. As a fisherman,
I also enjoyed being just 10 minutes from Lake Texoma, which is home to some wonderful bass-fishing. I would absolutely stay here again, and plan to the next time I want to fish Texoma."

All appliances were unexpectedly nice. The game room was an impressive set up. My kido couldn't get enough of the pac-man game. This is honestly one of the best airbnb experiences I've had in years. One thing I didn't see mentioned in other reviews is the proximity to an active rail road track. It didn't bother us too much, but if you are a light sleeper you need to bring your earplugs to improve your night."

The screened in patio is a perfect place to relax in the evenings and the grill was perfect for grilling out for the Cowboys game. The house was super clean and spotless and two nights was simply not enough to enjoy it fully. You can tell this place was well thought out by the host. We hope to be back soon!"

Plenty of room, smart TVs everywhere, and an awesome game room. Screened in-patio was really nice (even if it was deathly hot), and the area is quiet (except for the occasional train horn, its rural texas) and great for kids, who loved playing baseball at the nearby park. Really convenient to get to Lake Texoma, Denison, Sherman, Grayson CC and Texoma medical center. Neil is super friendly and professional."

And, when I asked if there was an outdoor grill, Neil noted that there was not one, but that he had planned to get one in the future. However, he went ahead and got the grill prior to our arrival a day or so later, so it was there waiting when we arrived. This was very thoughtful."

We left a day early and would have liked a refund but that didn’t happen.
It was cute, lots of unused space, we froze the first night cause we couldn’t turn the fan off, but all in all it worked out.
No doors on the bedroom. Weird. She provided filtered water and that was important to us. She was kind to us and communicative."

We were in town for a wedding and this location was a perfect home base. We ventured out to a winery, Edge of the Lake, and went to Top Golf in Allen. Both were easy to get to from the rental. Amy checked in with us during our stay. We did not need anything but appreciated her making sure all was well with our stay. We would stay here again."

Even though I was there during a heat wave, I was able to sleep comfortably with ceiling fans and window AC's. I was in town for family reunion and would stay here again if needed.
Hostess does not provide directions or key code until day of check in and depends on Airbnb access/pictures/information for communication so need Airbnb app. I did not have my pin number memorized so was not able to access. Recommend address be located during daylight hours, my gps took me to a different address. Also the apartment access is not on street address side and no light is provided or way to contact hostess until you are in the apartment, then a phone number is made available. Keyed entry for key access so need a light source."

Stayed a few nights","Amy’s place was our first Airbnb experience and she really set the bar for future stays. Check in/out was seamless, our stay quiet and relaxing, and we were close to the activities we were in Sherman to attend (the Sherman Celtic Festival was fabulous!) There are also fab places nearby to dine like the Downtown Grilled Cheese Factory(?) and a gelato place.
Speaking of fabulous, Amy adds unexpected extra touches like banana choc chip bread, eggs, butter and coffee creamer in the frig plus many comforts of home. Thank you!"

The furnace had an issue while we were there, but Amy fixed it within just a few minutes of our notifying her of a problem. The shower does not get super hot, but the tap does.
We would definitely stay again."

Wifi is a little spotty and may need more of a boost to make the place a business travelers option. With four years of Sherman trips in front of us, I'm sure we will be back frequently!"

A bit of a mixup on the front door key but got into the house thru the garage, and Kaylee did call back quickly about the key. Loved the backyard with lots of birds, tree frogs, and star-gazing. There were several feral cats visiting the yard, so anyone bringing a cat should be aware of this. In all a nice house in a great location."

We had plenty of space for all of us and a much better value and comfort than a hotel. Plus, having a garage to unload gear into and store was nice.
The hosts had options for the area, amenities etc but the best part was being welcomed with Christmas lights and a tree.
The hosts also went above and beyond. The coffee maker was acting up. I messaged the host to let them know with no expectation that it be fixed immediately. However, they almost immediately went out and replaced it. So much better to have hot coffee and cocoa when it’s freezing at the ballpark!
We’d definitely book for future stays."

When we arrived the home was stunning just from the outside, and the pictures of the inside of the home, really do no justice. You have to stay here to understand how beautiful and stunning this home is. The rooms were beautiful and very clean, and the kitchen and living room area were great as well.
One of Cynthia's rules is no pets (as there is someone who is very allergic to them). That is very understandable, and I would think that people would respect this rule when staying. Unfortunately, we were unable to enjoy the backyard as there was so much dog hair on all the seating outdoors. I would recommend that you follow all rules regarding no pets, so that others like myself can enjoy the home in its entirety (as it was such a beautiful weekend)
GREAT HOUSE!!"

Was in a very good neighborhood and a good location to get to any restaurants or shopping. Cynthia was a super host. Very communicative and clear on anything she needed to let me know. Any questions I had she was quick to respond. This is a place that I would definitely book again on my next trip to Sherman."

We were in town for a wedding and upon walking into the house, we noticed that it was very clean, comfortable, and inviting! The crib in the master bedroom and the socket protectors were also extra details that we appreciated since we were traveling with a 9 month old. Thank you, Cynthia!"

What makes it even more enjoyable is that the owner is tremendously attentive and kind. Communication about how and what to do are perfectly clear and she is an absolute delight to have as a host. The house is newer, very clean and conveniently located. Highly recommended!"

There were coffee tea and everything we needed to keep us going for the day before we ran for groceries.
Pantry has the basic necessities, enough pots and pans. Kitchen had everything we needed, even stuff to use for grilling. Everything was meticulously thought of.
The rooms were spacious, bed were really comfortable. The back yard was great... my toddler had more than enough space to run around. Neighborhood is very peaceful.
Cyndi was awesome very easy to communicate and have worked with our needs every step of the way. I would definitely stay again if we are around town. I would recommend this place in a heart beat. Thank you for hosting us!"

It is located in the woods, so it feels isolated if your looking for a nice place to escape and be alone. It's surrounded by wildlife, and the place has great windows for viewing the outside. We had a great view of a dear and many types of birds right out our windows.
Dennis was also very accommodating. He knew we were on our honeymoon, so he allowed us to check in early in the day so that we could get all of our things dropped off before the wedding. He was quick to respond and very kind. we hope to come back here many times to celebrate!"

Dennis is a fabulous host. I hope to stay here again soon!

We had our one year old with us, so we definitely had to keep a close eye on her around some of the decor, but it was definitely doable to stay here with a little one. There are plug in fans in the closet in case you come in the middle of a Texas summer. I’m currently 7 months pregnant, so I definitely needed the fans. We explored some of Sherman and Denison too during our stay. Overall it was good experience."

Loved all the thoughtful touches like the iwatch charging stand in the bedroom & Alexa in the living room. TV had all apps & perfect clear picture! The view is amazing from inside & from the deck. We heard the Coyotes at night made it feel like we were camping. We ate at sweetberries Cafe & city Limits both did not disappoint. Last but not least Dennis responded very quick & his decor for the Modern Treehouse is top notch exceeded our expectations : )"

Dennis is the HOST with the MOST and goes above and beyond to make sure his guests have absolutely everything they need. The Treehouse itself is an amazing eclectic collection of art and mid-modern decor with high end finishes, luxurious linens and comfortable seating for a large family or group. The sunsets are unbeatable and the house itself is nestled quietly and privately among the trees. We will DEFINITELY be back! A big THANK YOU to Dennis Teague of The Treehouse!"

Stayed one night","The house is as it seems in the pictures and it’s a delightful mid-century modern with lots of personality and thoughtfulness throughout typical to that design era. The place is decorated very nicely and the area is amazing. I took long walks to both parks and both times felt like it was my personal trek and not a town. Only negative is you can really hear through the walls, especially between bedroom 2 and the bathroom. Typical for the era but strange to get used to again. I will also say it’s not as close to Austin College as I thought. That’s on me - not Dennis. I just didn’t realize how big the town was.
Perhaps I’ll end up with a kid in Sherman and have an excuse to visit again and stay longer."

The two main beds were awesome and the futon and the mat over the sofa were comfy too. Found everything we needed in the kitchen for breakfast (teakettle, coffee maker, baking sheet, frying pans). Dennis has a great host binder with all the details needed for a great stay at this one of a kind house. We were glad for the Brita pitcher as the water here was not to our liking. Recommend 903 and the Downtown Grilled Cheese Company (beautiful pizza with arugula, lovely fresh salad, and yum ""Sherman Bock"".) Stop at McKinney Square on your way back into Dallas."

Kitchen was well stocked with utensils! First place we have stayed that they actually had plenty of silverware and plates for several meals, not just one. Beds are on the firm side and one bed is actually a futon. Bathroom was well supplied with toiletries and towels. Washer and dryer on site was very nice to have! The house is an open concept, so be prepared to hear others in the house especially at night time. This is definitely a house with lots of personality.

Stayed with kids","This place is MAGICAL. We visited in May when the trees were full and the weather’s not too hot yet and it was beyond beautiful. The view of all the trees from the back windows and off the back deck alone is worth the visit. But then you couple that with the absolutely stunningly designed interior and you’ve got a memorable vacation in the bag. The living room space is incredibly inviting, especially at night with all the lights on and both of the bedroom spaces are deluxe. You feel like you’re up in the trees the whole time with the amount of windows and natural light. Came with my kiddos and they loved exploring outside Will definitely come back for an adult’s only weekend to enjoy the silence and perfect spots for contemplation and reading."

Stayed a few nights","This place is by far one of my family's favorite Airbnb stays, and we've been at it since 2014 – staying all over the U.S. I have occasional work in the area and decided to bring my family this time for the week. From the vintage mid-century home itself to the furniture to the setting, it was perfect for our little family of four. Sitting on top of the secluded hill, surrounded by trees, it feels like you're in the woods. The natural light throughout the house is great, especially in the living space, and adds to the experience of being surrounded by nature. These things add to making any stay a nice retreat for us. The beds are comfy, the bathroom is very nice, and the common spaces are more than well-equipped for cooking, dining, relaxing, and even gathering and watching movies. The collection of art throughout the house is a treat in itself. Dennis is a great host and was always on top of communication before and during our stay. We are already planning a second stay as soon as possible!"

The openess of the kitchen, dining, lounge area with the wall of windows was our favorite part of the house. We loved it in winter so springtime there must be glorious. The decor and furnishings are unique & well placed creating a comfortable flow to a great layout. We enjoyed dinner and felt like we were in our own private dining area watching the sunset while pearched in the trees! It didn't bother us but a side note to sensitive sleepers - some road noise exists since there is a road at the very bottom of the hill. The house feels private and the deck is awesome."

There was something unique to look at everywhere you turned. The layout of the house is very unique and creates an ambiance unlike any other place. The host was also very personable. I love privacy when I visit a place as I usually stay at airbnbs to get away from it all. I felt like the host respected that but I also felt very secure knowing there was someone I could call if need be. There are also security cameras on the outside of the property which made me feel really safe as the house is sequestered on top of a hill. Very happy I stayed here and really enjoyed the antique mall just minutes away as well as the drive thru coffee shop just minutes away as well."

You get views of the trees from every area of the house and you can see sunset from either of the bedrooms, kitchen and deck as well. It was so nice to sit outside on the deck and enjoy the sounds of the birds there! Very stylish space yet it still felt cozy. I never felt like 'I can't touch this or that' in Dennis's home. Best sleep I have ever had at any Airbnb or out of any stay away from my own mattress at home. Was a breeze to find the bob, self check in with the keypad at the front door and Dennis is super responsive and helpful! Can't wait to come back! Would not hesitate to recommend a stay here!"

Stayed one night","If David Bowie's aesthetic had a house, this would be it.
Dennis's property takes you so far out of the uncomfortable stuffiness that is Texas into a home so cozy you would think you're in a STRFKR music video. Dennis goes above and beyond with the amenities, not once did we find ourselves twidling our thumbs in boredom. This stay is absolutely my favorite out of any I have ever rented, you better belive we will rent this property again the second we get the oppurtunity!"

Stayed a few nights","This mcm Treehouse in Sherman is a hidden gem! You will immediately feel transported to a lovely treetop escape and you will feel your breath relax upon arrival. The isolation is perfect, the beds, bath and overall beauty is just great. Knowing the history of the house just adds to the charm. The cicadas can be a bit noisy, but geesh, it’s ok because you’re in their treetops!! Herman Baker park, just around the corner, is a great place to get in a mile and 1/2 hike; very safe and north-Texas enjoyable. Dennis is a gracious host; I’m thrilled he shares this lovely spot with Airbnb - I certainly hope to return."

The view of the sunset is epic and the design and style of the decor are magical. The kitchen is well outfitted - we had everything we needed to cook breakfast and dinner. The beds are comfortable and the towels are luxurious. You will feel right at home.
We have wonderful memories of our stay and hope to be able to come back sometime in the not too distant future."

I felt comfortable and safe. Dennis responded to my questions quickly. I am from SoCal...when visiting don't depend accu-weather...I freeze when the temp is below 60. Be prepared for temp changes.

Stayed with kids","There are really no words to describe how far beyond expectations this gorgeous home is.

Dennis, our host, Impressed me from the get go. In True to Texas character, his hospitality is extraordinary and generous. The beds were terrific, Ultra clean, all amenities easily accessible, many needs anticipated with solutions. It is a large, carefully planned functional space, yet beautiful. His mid- century modern décor had no extra flourishes to detract. The place is spare, open and spectacular, focused on the acres of woodland surrounding it. Plus, the art is FABULOUS.

The host’s guide to local eateries, events, etc. is extensive includes many brochures.

Hope he doesn’t change a thing. Why mess with perfection?

The house is surrounded by woods, parks and has miles of hiking trails. Many square miles of nature call for exploration. The back porch is large and juts out high in the canopy. It really does feel like a treehouse. We would have lived out there but it was august in Texas.

ADVICE: The home is entirely safe for children. But young, undisciplined children are dangerous to the beautiful art and fine collectible furniture. Caution: do not bring children under age 5 and they should be well behaved. Otherwise, you’ll be defending the house 24/7 from destruction. I speak from experience.

We plan to stay in the treehouse again, sans children, so Jody (husband) can work on his book."

This home is gorgeous, modern, and strikes the right balance between luxurious and comfortable. There’s ample room to relax on both the front and back patios, which are surrounded by striking greenery. The views from inside truly feel like a treehouse! This is the perfect quiet place to relax and unwind. We loved our stay!"

The beds are incredibly comfortable and you are surrounded by nature in a peaceful setting with an outstanding view plus a deck. It's the perfect escape from the busy aspects of life. I enjoyed relaxing with a glass of wine and a good book in the sitting area. But if you wanted to watch a movie he also has wonderful set up for enjoying a show in the living room. The kitchen has everything you need and every room has incredible natural light. I highly recommend this location! This is a spot for adults not for little kiddos. My husband and two teens loved it and appreciated the art, furniture design and architecture."

The views behind the house were breathtaking. Upon entry into Dennis’s home I was blown away. My favorite thing about my stay, hands down would be the decor! Mid century mod with a blend of New Mexico -tribal vibe. It was so dreamy. I am so thankful I got to experience such beauty!!
