Stayed a few nights","The apartment is attached Elizabeth's home which met the description and more. Trey & Elizabeth are great communicators and offered different options for check-in. Trey gave us a tour of the unit & welcomed us like we were out of town guests in their home. He informed us that he would provide breakfast (famous homemade muffins). I like older homes, so this was a treat for me with tall ceilings, pocket doors, great wifi, & comfortable furniture. Lots of room to relax and enjoy! There were even pictures of their beautiful daughters around the apartment. Coco stopped by a couple of times to check on us to make sure we were good. We felt secure with our hosts next door. This is our go to rental in the Greenwood area!"

Stayed one night","I must say that I am very pleased with our stay at Elizabeth's place. Elizabeth is a fabulous host. The house is inviting, clean and gives a home away from home feel. We usually stay at The Alluvian hotel near by, but boy if i would have known of Elizabeth's place the previous times we visited Greenwood I would have stayed there. The rental is in a lovely part of town..quiet and a safe neighborhood. Her daughter made us a delicious treat that we had for breakfast. I must also add that the bed and pillows were very comfortable. This is something I am highly critical of because I am professional in the lodging industry and travel quite a bit for work...it's a rare find!!"

This place was one of the best we have ever stayed in! Elizabeth was a great host and was easy to communicate with when we had a question. We definitely recommend it and will definitely stay there again if baseball takes us that way in the future.

Stayed about a week","Communication with Elizabeth was excellent. The unit has its own entrance from the main house. Parking is on the side of the unit, an area on the side street. There was sufficient lighting. The unit has high ceilings which make it open and inviting and is as photographed. I booked the unit for one week. During this time the weather was warm but then a cold front moved in. The air conditioning worked well and the heat radiated throughout. The rocker in the bedroom was very comfortable. Snacks & drinks were available. The kitchen allows plenty of area to cook if you do not want to eat out. Elizabeth brought over some hot blueberry muffins that most of the reviews comment on. I agree they were delicious. I would not hesitate to book this unit again should the need arise."

The place is large, clean and make you feel like home. In the bathroom, you are provided with lotion, soap, shampoo and others items that you may need. Off from the bathroom is a large washer and dryer and a walk-in shower. The kitchen has everything needed to cook whatever meal you want. The living room has a flat tv on the wall and a comfortable rocking chair. The bedroom has a large closet and a very comfortable queen size bed. Anyone who is looking for an airbnb, this is one of the best in the U.S., so don't let this one get away. You and your family will have a great experience that will have lasting memories.

Stayed one night","My stay at Elizabeth's place was idyllic! From the communication that accommodated my circumstances on the front end to the follow up afterward - just a breeze! The location was perfect and picturesque with just the right touches to make you feel at home in the MS Delta. The space was so open and roomy with natural light beaming in. The bed was particularly comfortable, with soft sheets and a bedspread that seemed weighted, and I was able to snuggle right in for a much needed sound sleep! The photos really don't do it justice. Additionally - b/c of Covid, I took wipes and spray with me, but it was super clean and I felt completely at ease. When I think about what I would have paid to stay in a box of a room, with no personal touches or feel, compared to what I experienced for this stay, I'm confident in telling anyone that they just must try this out instead. They won't be disappointed!"

Stayed a few nights","QUALITY CARE, ATTENTION AND CONCERN that is genuine. They are legit. Their kindness is only matched by their non-stop generocity. I absolutely love the fact that these two know exactly what they're doing and it is evident in the upkeep of their property and their attention to ensuring you the best possible experience you can have in an Airbnb. Also, it is comforting to know that they are very much on top of all COVID-19 regulations, protocols, etc the works. And whatever you may have heard about the blueberry muffins is the truth. Man they were some kind of good. Simply is you are looking for a championship Airbnb experience, then this is a no-brainer. 6-Stars."

Stayed one night","Elizabeth was an amazing host and her guest house is just as amazing as she is!! I have to admit when I read all the reviews about the blueberry muffins I couldn’t wait to try one. Elizabeth brought them over straight out of the oven and Oh My Goodness,,,I may or may not have eaten more then 1!!! They are worth your stay all by themselves lol. As long as Elizabeth’s place is available when we travel to greenwoood we will not even consider anywhere else!"

Stayed one night","Book it!!!!! This was my first Air BnB experience, and I’m pretty sure all the future ones will lead to disappointment because Elizabeth & Trey do such an amazing job.
The apartment is even cuter than it looks in the online photos! It’s like a 900-1000 sq ft mother-in-law quarters with a cozy living space and kitchen. There is a nice stack of board games. There were bananas, bottled water, coffee/tea, and even some spaghetti noodles and sauce.
They are also the sweetest couple. I saw the other reviews about homemade blueberry muffins, but Elizabeth actually makes HOMEMADE blueberry muffins. There are whole, fresh blueberries in them.
We also asked about directions and she graciously offered to pick us up since she would be out and about herself. We were floored at the above and beyond hospitality!
Upon initially booking the trip, I was originally disappointed the Alluvian Hotel was booked, but after staying with this family, I think we got the better deal.
Everything was perfect, and they are absolutely wonderful."

Stayed one night","Elizabeth was absolutely amazing from the moment she first contacted me. My stay exceeded any expectations I had. Elizabeth and Trey met me as I drove in and helped me park. They both assisted me in getting my luggage in. Fresh blueberry muffins awaited me (I had not had dinner and was very hungry) on the counter as well as snacks and drinks in the fridge. The Apartment was sparkling clean and very spacious. The space was large and comfy with beautiful views. The space contained a stackable washer and dryer hidden away, hair dryer, soaps, etc. in case something was forgotten. Detailed notes, instructions, contact numbers, area tips were all laid out for me. I have severe allergies impacted by strong fragrances. Elizabeth went out of her way to make sure I knew all the cleaners used. I woke up well rested and migraine free. I felt safe in the neighborhood. I will definitely return when back in town. Every little detail was carefully thought out. Here you will find the southern hospitality you read about."

It is in a run down neighborhood. The house is remarkably old and fascinating, but with that comes some mild odors the owners worked to mask with candles and such. There are cats around the property. If you have allergies I would suggest a different place to stay.

The home was vintage and had a great antique look, but had a very bad odor. I assume the odor came from the home being so old. The home odor was my biggest issue.

Stayed a few nights","I can’t say enough good things about Ms. Maggie’s Place. It is a hidden gem. I loved every second of it from the beginning we walked through the door until we left.
We were there for my sons baseball tournament and it was just minutes away. Between games we were able to come back “home” relax and cook/grill.
It was so cozy and comfortable.
Sitting on the front porch brought back many fond childhood memories of sitting on my grandparents front porch.
We can’t wait to come back.
You WILL NOT regret staying here and will want to stay again and again.
Bro. Tony was fabulous too. So kind and available!

The cabin is beautiful, stained, tongue-in-groove with a nice, well stocked kitchen and all the comforts of a nice cabin/home.
It sits on a beautiful lot, nice to the water, with LOTS of porch space, outdoor griddle, fire pit and grill. It's in the country and a good fifteen minute ride to any restaurant. Very peaceful.
Simply put, what you see in the ad is what you get. It strikes a wonderful balance of primitive (location) and modern (solid construction with modern conveniences). Loved the stay and wish it could have been longer."

Stayed a few nights","Daryl’s cabin is set on river way that opens to a lake. The water levels might change the experience some during the summer, but still enjoyable I imagine. As a marker for us, Yazoo River was at 22.1 ft @ Greenwood. We were able to navigate a 18ft canoe down river for a couple of miles with more to be had. If you are any kind of fisherman, this will be a delight. The river is bordered by cypress trees adding to the scenic views. I should note we saw no one else on the water while we were there, which was nice for us. The cabin gives you great access to the water with a small boat landing.
As for the cabin, it was cozy. We brought much of our own stuff, but it seemed well-equipped to hand most any kitchen or leisure tasks. If you are here for the ‘country escape’ or the fishing/water, you’ll be in heaven.
We took our dogs and placed a kennel on the back porch. They had a ball.
We took a bike ride down the county road one morning, which was fun.
The phone coverage is very iffy, but that was nice too. We did not need much, but daryl was very responsive and checked on us one day (I see that as a nice gesture since the cell phone coverage is iffy).
We plan to come back as I hone my fishing skills. :-)
If you are looking for a chill place that offers fishing or kayaking on a peaceful lake/river and don’t mine getting a little dirty at times, book this place. It’s obviously a piece of Daryl, and Daryl is a nice guy that’s down to Earth.
Thx,
Casey and Jay"

There’s a great dock overlooking the lake, fire pit, plenty of solitude and wildlife. The pictures don’t do this cabin justice.

Stayed a few nights","I rented this home searching for peace and quiet and that is exactly what I got. The host is great. I liked that he had kayaks to use so I didn’t have to haul mine down there. Make sure you get directions in advance. The gps with that address took me an hour out of the way. Cell service isn’t good out there which was fine by me. I didn’t have much luck fishing (unless you count trees). The serenity and beauty made up for that. Mosquitoes will be looking forward to your arrival so pack extra bug spray. His house is furnished perfectly, inside and out. He has the most exquisite table in the living room. It truly was a work of art. The decor was perfect for a cabin. I loved the signs. The sheets in the bedroom were nice. I didn’t even have to use the ones I brought with me. The owner had to come meet me because I couldn’t find it. He is a very likable guy with great stories. I went by myself with my dogs. I think this place would be awesome for couples and families too. The fact that he had Direct tv out there was a nice surprise."

Stayed with kids","We had a WONDERFUL stay! It was everything we were looking for and more. We took our baby and two dogs and they were all at home the moment we arrived! The kayaks were great to take out on the lake with the dogs swimming behind. We tugged our baby behind the kayak in his own little boat! We were afraid before arriving that there might be alligators but there weren't and also Daryl said he has never seen one at the cabin. Bring bug spray! For some reason, we got eaten alive. Totally still worth it though.
One thing - Dont follow the GPS directions that AirBNB gives. Just head into Money, MS instead and then follow his directions.
Enjoy!"

Stayed one night",Mr Bill went above and beyond what was expected of him. My arrival time was late as I am a truck driver who needed a place to stay for the night. He very graciously offered to pick me and my son up from where we had to park my truck and trailer. If in the area again I will most certainly be looking to stay with him again and many more times I hope as I’m out that way quit often with the work I do. Thank you again to Mr Bill and his kindness!!!

Bill has a very clean, accomodating space supplied with all the amenities. (Heated floors in the bathroom and bath robes in the closet were a happy plus.) The bed was very comfy (after a Viking Cooking School class about 15-20 minutes away in Greenwood). The hosts were so easy to communicate with. (Thanks Bill for the restaurant recommendation.) We definitely want to go back in the near future to enjoy the pool and the beautiful grounds and anything else we may have missed. Thank you again for your hospitality."

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at this properties pool house was more than sufficient and very comfortable! Plenty of towels, comfortable bedding, kitchen dishes, ice, bath robes, etc., were provided! plenty of seating inside. Very cute and nicely decorated. It feels very homey. Our one time needing communication was promptly available and they were super nice to speak to! The pool is an awesome bonus . We spent our Friday walking downtown Greenwood shops, ate at the Crystal Grill, our Saturday in the pool, and Saturday evening with a Viking cooking class! Great location to stay as an alternative to the Alluvian hotel. My only notation is that the outside area was a tad bit unkept adjacent to the pool and was “junky” and the porch furniture was pretty dirty and could have used a blowing off. It did not affect our stay in a large way - this was our only notable negative. There are also plenty of fans set i’m up so that you may still enjoy the porch in the Southern Delta Summer! this was a huge plus! I would definitely return to this property again& recommend!"

We felt so relaxed as we lounged by the pool & read our books in the oversized hammock in front of the fountain. The house is so tastefully decorated & the bed was extremely comfortable. We slept like babies! The outdoor shower is an extremely cool & unique feature that we very much enjoyed as well. The grounds are immaculately well maintained with a garden bursting with colorful flowers & fruit trees lining the back of the property. We loved taking walks in the evening down by the cypress lined river that runs in front of the main house. There is also a fire pit that Bill provided wood & fire starter for so that we could make s'mores! Our stay there was extremely peaceful & we left there feeling very refreshed.

Love how big and unusual deep it was! Would have preferred it to not have been so murky but understandable it's still early in the year for swimming. The outside shower was delightful and so enjoyable! Makes you want to stay there all day however the hot water does eventually run out. Our weekend went by way to fast! Would love to visit again!

This was the first time I've rented an Airbnb in which the host was on site. I had wondered how the experience might be different, and quickly realized it was in all the best possible ways! Bill greeted us and gave us a tour of the guesthouse. He's put a lot of time and thought into every detail and it shows. Speaking with him was like visiting with an old friend. His place is just as warm and inviting as he is.
A short drive to Greenwood to visit the local shops and restaurants made this location perfect. Bill gave us suggestions on places to eat and visit that were spot on.
If you're looking for a place to stay as a couple, family, or a girl's getaway you've found it! We can't wait to visit again ourselves."

Stayed a few nights","Stayed at this cottage for our annual girls trip. The hosts were out of town but were easily accessible and checked on us to make sure we didn’t have any problems checking in and made several dining suggestions. We ended up just staying in and eating our meals in the guest house. We only ventured out to shop for pottery. The guest house was very nice, clean, comfortable and had everything we needed. We really enjoyed the beautiful pool and sitting on the front porch under the fans. The hosts provided bug spray as mosquitos are bad this time of year. Fresh flowers from the hosts beautiful yard, comfy robes, and big beach towels were nice touches. We had a wonderful and relaxing time. We will definitely be back!"

Driving in was slightly confusing, but that’s no fault of the owners, it’s just tricky to find. The pool was so pretty and the surrounding scenery made for such a picturesque experience. We ate dinner outside and got to see some fireflies dancing around the yard as it got darker! So pretty! Check out the swing across from the house that overlooks the swamp area, it’s so peaceful and pretty. We would definitely come here again!"

Beautiful grounds. Gorgeous space. The AirBnB is a mother-in-law cottage. A beautifully-appointed mother-in-law cottage.
Four of us stayed there. My wife and I stayed in the bedroom. My daughter-in-law and her beaux stayed in the sofa bed. Everyone had a good night’s sleep, and there was plenty of space to not feel as if we were tripping over one another.
We met Bill briefly on the front end. Generations-deep Delta resident. A delightful soul.
This would be an excellent base from which to explore the Mississippi Delta. Highly recommended."

Stayed a few nights","I reply back on email sent
Here a few things I’ll add to the review as well
Nice house, great location, entertainment, games, washer:dryer, nice backyard yo chill with friend n family
I did not like that I was not told about a camera 🎥 in the inside of house as the master I had run across to go to the bathroom so it’s a invading of privacy and I may have not rented it or you books have covered it as you had the one in the den turn around but still could have be on.
I text about closet space as I was there 5 days n had to hang clothes after iron them all closet was locked, front door made of glass not tinted n neighbors can see through they house when they sit on porch so I did not sleep 😴 well, pots n pans was old n dirty-I had to borrow from friends to cook, weather changed could not adjust it, my husband said pit bbq was not cleaned, we have to clean the house before leaving when you charge a fee
We slept things that we did not have.
Overall your booklet n layout is awesome just"

Spotlights in the front of the house shine into the windows and front door and there are no curtains. There was loud music with bass in the neighborhood when we stayed. Consider bringing an eye mask and earplugs if you’re a light sleeper."

Our family of four enjoyed our visit, rested soundly, and felt at home in the quiet and friendly neighborhood. The location was ideal; close to charming downtown Greenwood and just a short drive to some must-visit spots (Drake's BBQ being one!). The house was clean and comfortable and had everything we needed for our three-day stay. The backyard was an oasis, especially in the July Delta heat! A light breeze and the shade in the seating area she's created made it perfectly comfortable, especially in the early mornings and evenings. Our kids super appreciated Connect4 and UNO and it helped them feel welcome and at ease. LaToya was responsive, gracious, and friendly in all our communications. This is a great spot to land and we wouldn't hesitate to stay again or recommend to others!"

Stayed a few nights","I enjoyed my stay, it was peaceful, very clean, and had everything I needed, It was my first time at airbnb, I loved the
fact that I could cook, even wash if needed, I was visiting my Grandmother, and spend most of the day with her.
Overall I will be doing airbnb from now on."
