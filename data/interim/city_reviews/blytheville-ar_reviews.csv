Stayed a few nights","Everythng, kitchen, bedrooms and baths were clean and neat. The entrance code listed on paperwork was outdated but Monte returned my voice message within minutes and the issue was resolved. We rented the house with another couple to be near the path or totality for the April 8th eclipse. This house was perfect for our needs. Plenty of room for several couples. I would recomend this house to anyone wanting to stay in the area."

The home was well appointed with everything we needed: extra blankets, coffee pods, kitchen items. There was plenty of hot water and the house is clean. It is an older home and has older home quirks and charms. But it was very comfortable and spacious. The country setting was peaceful and calming during a hard moment.

They were very impressed at the cleanliness and excess of things that were available. I will definitely be using this place again. Thank you!"

She was so kind about allowing us to book later in the evening/sam day and provided very specific directions for how to find the house. We did not have any trouble getting here whatsoever. Sara has lots of candy, snacks, and drinks provided in the cabin that make it feel cozy and welcoming. I truly have nothing to complain about with this cabin. If we are ever in this area again, we will be sure to book this sunroom. A million times better, safer, and cleaner than a hotel room."

Cons: It was freezing when I came in, to the point I sat in my car for 30 minutes to wait for it to warm up. (The heater does work fine once it’s been turned on for awhile, I ended up cozy). I’m not certain if the value is there considering hotels in the area go for the same price or cheaper. (I don’t intend to be harsh on the hosts, I’m still giving 5 stars. this is just my honest review for fellow travelers)"

Stayed with a pet","The host was very responsive, considering we made a last-minute reservation due to issues with another Airbnb host. The room was very clean and stocked with lots of candy and soda and water. The home is a little out-of-the-way, so it wasn’t super convenient to get to, but we found it just fine. The host has two very friendly dogs that stay outside and during the night they woke us up a few times barking which meant we didn’t get as much sleep as we were hoping for. Also, there are two large windows in the room that don’t have any shades, which meant we couldn’t sleep in because it got so bright in the room. Other than that, everything was fine. The host was very friendly and responsive. I think it would be great for someone who isn’t a light sleeper like myself."

I appreciate that her place is pet friendly. Her dogs were adorable and came over to say hi, just beware of this if your pet doesn’t like to be approached by other animals."

The pond and patio were fun to spend time on. We saw rabbits, frogs, the catfish feeding routine and enjoyed petting their great perinese dogs.
When Sarah learned that we had some special needs for the visit, she was instant in beginning preparations to accommodate us."

Stayed one night","Sarah was very friendly and quick to respond. The morning we left for our trip she made sure to send driving directions, helpful tips, how to flawlessly use the keypad to help ourselves into the sunroom, and what to expect when arriving. The place is nicely decorated, and cute. She made sure everything we may need was stocked and in good taste. Beautiful country scenery. The fur babies were an added addition, however, very very well mannered! There were treats left so that if we wanted to make friends with the pups, we could. Again, they were very mannered. Check out was super easy, just a quick message to let her know we’ve gone. We hope to revisit this place and enjoy the amities we weren’t able to during our stay due to the weather."

Stayed a few nights","The Sunroom is great; exactly what I was looking for. It's somewhat secluded and very peaceful. It's exactly as described and very clean. I especially enjoyed the deep soaker tub (something hotels rarely have) for easing aching muscles. The patio is really nice, and if you want a small fire just walk across the road and use the fire pit/ring next to the pond. I didn't think about it at the time, but I suppose you could build a small fire and roast a few hotdogs and/or marshmallows. The pond is full of catfish and you can feed them or try to catch some from the dock with the included fishing gear (I preferred to just feed them). The Sunroom is just a few minutes from visiting friends/family, shopping, dining, entertainment and Reynold's Park (I think that's still the name) which can be accessed by at least two directions (I used both). Overall, a very pleasant experience and one I recommend."

Stayed one night","The Sunroom is a gem in Paragould located on the route we travel from Kentucky to Texas. It is maybe two miles from the main drag and easy to find. Just my wife and myself were in our party. The Sunroom is not huge but plenty of space for two people that like each other or a couple with one or two children. Spotless, squeaky clean with all amenities and plenty of extras (Keurig coffee maker, soft drinks in the fridge, breakfast food, and a truck full of sweets). Extremely well constructed with a well thought out floor plan, efficient use of space, and a very interesting and tasteful decor. PEACEFUL AND QUIET which is what we were looking for after a long drive from Houston. Clear, timely and friendly communication from Sarah. Everything top notch. Would stay again in a heartbeat if available on our next trip.
Thanks for a great stay. We truly appreciate the effort.

Loved it it was so cute and the interior design as cute. Wouldn’t recommend bringing frozen food it’s got a compartment abt big enough for an ice tray but not for frozen food. Host were very friendly and helpful. My large dog love all the land and my small one loved to bask in the sun 10/10 would recommend for couples who appreciate peace and quiet and nature. Only abt 10 mins from a gas station and Walmart along with some other restaurants.lovely place !

The bathroom and kitchen were stocked with items that we found to be a nice touch to the place. Even the doggos had a treat! The yard was more than large enough for our pups to run around in and they even played with Sarah's dogs (who were extremely friendly to both dogs and humans). Overall, we loved our stay and would recommend Sarah's to anyone!"

They were very helpful and kind (even when I accidentally parked on their lawn!) The unit was very clean, stocked with snacks and spacious. But the best part of this stay is the sweet, friendly dogs hanging out on the property. The dogs were eager for pets and head scratches but also veryyy chill with me and my dog. I'd definitely stay here again as a pit stop on my road trip home."

Stayed a few nights","Several aspects of this rental didn’t meet expectations, and I offer the following comments in a constructive spirit in hopes that conditions improve as a result. I would have expressed them directly to Sarah, but she was out of town. (In fact, I saw no one at all on the premises for the entirety of my stay.) First off, the positives: The remote setting is peaceful and quiet; even the very inquisitive, super affectionate resident dogs were –thankfully– “bark free”. The compact rental unit was tidy (with the exception of the toilet bowl, which was streaked and obviously had not been cleaned, and a bucket littered with cigarette butts between the two patio chairs on the small outdoor seating area next to the front door). The Keurig capsule coffee machine was in fine working order, but most other aspects of the kitchenette were sadly deficient. Here is an inventory: There was no flatware or eating implements save for a small wicker basket with plastic forks and spoons – no knife of any sort. The drawer labeled “Utensils” contained only scissors and one plastic spoon. No bottle opener or corkscrew. No bowls at all, no plates except for small and flimsy paper plates and a few larger plastic ones that warped and cracked when heating up take-out food in the microwave. For drinking, there was a solitary tall water glass (but four coffee mugs). Some of the missing elements were puzzling: Breakfast cereal and milk were provided, but there were no bowls. Is the guest supposed to use a coffee mug and a plastic spoon to eat the cereal? The small kitchen sink did have dish soap, but no sponge or dish towel. In other respects, there were no hooks to hang clothing or wet items (rather awkward given the heavy rains on both days of my stay), although the unit was adorned with several Christian crosses inscribed with Bible verses. The only potential clothes storage options were a heavy metal bar with one hanger perched precariously under the AC unit and directly above the bed; there was a bureau at the foot of the bed, but the top three drawers were stuffed with extra bedding. As to the bed itself, the mattress was adequate, but the all-polyester sheets were uncomfortable, and the bottom sheet was riddled with pilling. Finally, the Wi-Fi signal was weak (the router must have been in the main house next door): It worked, albeit quite slowly, on my iPad, but not at all on my PC laptop. If Sarah opts to resolve these issues, The Sunroom would be a much more satisfying retreat space."

It smelled nice, it’s newly renovated, clean, simple but all the necessities! Bed was comfy and it was quiet.
After a walk around the pond we met some of the family pups and they were all well behaved, friendly and wanted belly rubs! Thor got to make some friends before we got back on the road!
Finding these little gems have made our road trips even better!

The outdoor area is a beautiful park like setting & very well maintained. There’s a private stocked pond available for fishing which our family thoroughly enjoyed during our stay. The pictures online do not compare to seeing it in person. Home sits just behind a well maintained ranch which had miniature horses & other animals. During fishing we were greeted by them & had so much fun interacting with them. This home is absolutely amazing & so tastefully decorated for a true county cabin theme. Extremely clean & wonderful amenities inside. The huge open area shower was so relaxing & the smart toilet was an added bonus! PERFECT!! We will definitely be returning & highly recommend!!

We appreciated the fresh eggs and the fact that they had spices to be able to cook in the house. The property is amazing and had lots of room for our dog to roam. We highly recommend Deanna’s home. Communication with her was amazing as well and she was very flexible with our stay."

Watching the cranes and the geese near the pond. I live on a 10 acre property, so I felt so much at home here. Deanna was considerate and responsive.

Deanna was awesome. She and Frankie were so personable, yet not intrusive. There's a reason she's a SuperHost.The farm fresh eggs in the fridge were a nice touch.
On the wedding day, we were gone around 10 hours and they made sure our little Molly (Malti-poo) was taken out for a walk several times, and loved on her, which she loves. We don't use Air BNB's often in this area, but we will probably come back, just to spend more time on the property, resting and enjoying the scenery. And, next time, I'm bringing my fishing tackle!!!"

Farm fresh eggs were a plus and we had a good morning greeting from their beautiful husky who was taking a morning stroll. We had a 12 yo with us, so felt uncomfortable staying right in the heart of Memphis, but a quick 40 minute drive from the air bnb to Memphis made for a perfect location. The host reached out before we got there asking if we would like them to set up the blow up mattress for our third guest and they had the mattress made and neat for us. Bottled waters in the fridge were also awesome. They have board games and the bed was very comfortable. Can’t say enough positive things about this stay. Will 100% be back."

There were plenty of towels in the bathroom, throw blankets in the living room, and extra bedding in the closet. The screened in back porch is an awesome place to sit and read and listen to the sounds of nature - minimal noise pollution and lots of cricket sounds! The pond (which I did not expect to enjoy as much as I did!) is stocked with several types of fish, and anyone who wants to will be able to catch something! Deanna was amazingly responsive and accommodating. There was a basket of fresh eggs from their chickens in the fridge when I arrived, and trust me when I say you haven’t had eggs until you’ve had farm fresh eggs. Expectations met and exceeded for sure!"

The place had everything needed to enjoy our stay. Very relaxing location in the country. Perfect for escaping the hustle and bustle of the big city but, close enough to get out and enjoy what Memphis has to offer. Several small towns nearby for dining out/groceries. This was by far our favorite Airbnb experience: the location, the hosts, the home and the little touches around the place to make us feel at home. There’s a small pond to relax by or the small screened in porch (we enjoyed our breakfast there each day). They have some chickens you can visit. They even brush some eggs our first day there! We hope to return someday for a longer stay and bring our daughter with. Can’t say enough good things about this experience."

Stayed with kids","Friendly, responsive host. The stay does have a private drive, but beware of bottoming out (Mazda3 bottomed out every time). The location is what it is and we wouldn’t recommend this part of Tennessee in general but in our situation, it’s where we needed to be and this stay was more than sufficient. The home is secure feeling and is a simple uncluttered space.
It should also be noted that the entry and exit is controlled by a third party app. If you are unable to load another app to your phone or don’t have your phone charged/available/etc you will not be able to enter or exit without the host overriding (which naturally, you wouldn’t be able to notify them if you have no phone charged or available). There is no key or keypad available as an alternative and to lock when leaving you must also use the app.
Overall, for having to travel to a less than desirable part of the state, this stay definitely made the experience better, it’s quiet, feels safe, quite clean and friendly host."

Stayed about a week","A relaxing stay in a new town during training week at a new job. The cozy cottage was a joy to come ""home"" to. The host left some coffee and creamers to get through our first day, which was much appreciated. The neighbors are nice and the neighborhood is older and quaint. We were able to walk to church on Sunday. The kitchen was nicely setup so we could enjoy our own home cooked meals. The hosts were very responsive to our needs. We had car trouble one day and I forgot to lock the front door. I called them and they were able to lock it remotely. Tip: Bring a hair dryer, if you need one."

Only caution I would give is that the driveway and street parking is a tighter fit than expected. If you are driving a car it will be fine but we were driving our truck and it was a tight squeeze. It was fine! Just took some maneuvering."

Every amenity is provided you could wish for- the only complaint I had was the stash of Hershey bars in a dish welcoming me when I entered every day. That was NOT conducive to a diet!!! The bed literally made me melt- I always went right to sleep. The bathtub is nice and deep- wish I had more time off between shift to soak more! Best host too! Also was available to answer the simplest of questions- checking in was a breeze, all you need is a cell phone! A hidden gem for sure! STAY HERE IF YOU COME TO DYERSBURG!"

When we showed up, the TV was on and we were wondering if we were in the wrong house lol. There were also some stuff left behind. One of the plates left out had crumbs on them and there were makeup eyebrow supplies in the kitchen. There was also some unwashed stains on our bedsheets. It seemed like someone stayed at that place and we walked into the place right after it was used. Overall the house is nice but there could definitely be improvements to the cleaning."

Stayed with a pet","Gloria’s house was great for our intended use. Myself and two friends were on a purpose driven trip to Arkansas and that was to duck hunt. We had a few questions for Gloria before our trip and she was more than willing to answer our questions and even continually checked in during our trip. We did not do any exploring while we were there which is what drove my 4 star review for location. The only amenities that we explored were the grocery store and gas stations so I can’t speak on amenities. The Kroger grocery store was excellent and had absolutely everything we needed. All in all Gloria was a great host and the house was newly renovated, we enjoyed our stay. Gloria also had basic kitchen necessities in the kitchen for cooking, as well as a charcoal grill to use, which we used several nights while we were there. The washer and dryer were excellent to have as well. We were running ahead of schedule on our way out to stay and Gloria was more than willing to let us check in early!"

Stayed with kids","let me preface this by saying, I didn't stay at the home. the listing was inaccurate, it was no longer active. I reached out to Gloria 2 hours before arriving to get the code to access the rental, to which she never responded. I was 5 minutes from the place when I was finally able to get in contact with air bnb, who was easily able to speak to her when she ignored my calls and texts. they informed me the listing wasn't *supposed to* be active. I had to find a quick cheap hotel at 10pm as I was out $300 and had a long trip. once in the hotel, she texted back to me saying ""I'm sorry but I don't have any listings"", making me feel gaslit and enforcing she had just been completely avoiding my messages."

We found the rental to be even better than expected. Very clean and smelled so nice. Kellie had thought of everything. It is located outside of town which made it so quiet. She and her husband told us that the cicadas had arrived. We actually enjoyed listening to them. But the rental is so tight that we never heard them inside. The bed was soooooo comfortable. We made the decision to always stay there if it’s available when we visit Paragould. We stayed three nights.

She couldn'tget it to work either so she flagged her husband down as he was mowing the yard. He was just finishing so came right over & got it working. He made sure we knew how to turn it on and get the stations we wanted. They are a very sweet couple. We will be back!

Very nice amenities and squeaky clean!! The driveway was a little hard to find since the map took us to the main house, but finding it was easy enough after realizing the mistake. The bed was a little soft for our taste, but the rest of the stay was top notch!"

If you don't like dogs- I would be hesitant to book because she has several that roam the property- we are dog people and did not mind. If you need a quick place to stay- this is perfect but we wish there was a little more privacy overall on the property."

My only real problem is that the driveway is a bigger deal than the listing makes it sound like. Small vehicles would have trouble. I was in a Yukon XL. A VERY large SUV, and the length meant that I scraped when pulling out unless I cut the tires very sharply.
Nice place and convenient! Taxi’s run in this area with enough heads up."

I cooked all my meals in the full kitchen. All pots, pans, plates, cups and utensils provided, just bring your own food and oil for cooking. Walmart and Aldi nearby if you forget anything. Visited Crowley Ridge State Park (only 15 minutes away) and ambled down a couple short hiking trails. The hosts are very friendly, respond promptly, and give you your privacy while making it clear that they’re happy to help if you need anything. I would be happy to stay here again!"

Stayed one night","Kellie has an amzingly cozy, clean, and beautifully designed guesthouse with plenty of emenities for a couple on a romantic getaway or if you want to just get away from the hotels and city for the night. It's all gorgeously updated and she even has spices for cooking and coffee for the mornings. Thank you Kellie for the warm welcome and all of your help!"
