We brought along my dog and the side yard was plenty for him to do his business. The furniture was comfortable and the beds were great also. It’s also in a great location so we never had to drive more than a few minutes to get to where we wanted to go. I would absolutely come back!

Stayed with a pet","I was visiting Lafayette as the place I grew up 60+ years ago. This home is in a perfect location to explore Lafayette and the surroundings area. Very clean. Has fenced backyard space, if you are bringing a dog. There is also a nice area to walk your dog around with grass. The location is very safe and excellent grocery shopping is very close. The bed is comfortable and the kitchen has a large refrigerator, stove, oven, microwave. The washer and dryer are great. There were 2 of us and our dog. Didn't need to use the 2nd bedroom which is upstairs with a bath. Jay is very responsive and takes care of your requests very quickly.
A great stay. I would recommend to anyone visiting Lafayette."

If you are heading to Lafayette for work or play, I can't recommend a better place to stay. I travel for work and am there for about 2 weeks a month. The apt is situated in what I find to be the best area in Lafayette with shopping, restaurants and coffee within a 5-10 minute walk.
The place is immaculate, furnished tastefully, with serene colors and lovely accents. The kitchen is highly functional and a coffeemaker on hand is a plus! Jay is accessible, responds quickly to any questions and offers loads of helpful suggestions on food, drink, and local attractions. Of the various types and levels of accommodation I have tried in Lafayette, this is my hands down favorite!"

Beds and furniture throughout the house was very comfortable and the house was pristine. Wi-Fi was great and he even had Roku so we could watch streaming shows. We spent a lot of time on the back porch. It’s covered and soooo nice. We started every day there and determined our agenda for the day. Then in the evenings, we would sit out there and chat and chill out. I had to check work emails and the Wi-Fi allowed me to log into my virtual desktop. Believe it or not, that’s not always the case!! Would absolutely come back!!!"

The home itself is older, but inside the house there are refurbishments made. I’d loved the master bedroom, the mattress was very comfortable. The television has all the online channels you need. The pool was heated, that was a nice touch. We do think the pool needs some attention. The kitchen has everything you need: enough utensils, basic condiments. Contact with Louis was quick and easy."

We did have an issue with the pool not being very clean but very quickly realized that was not due to lack of maintenance but more the number of trees in the area (we had lots of leaves dropping on us as we swam). The shading the trees provided was amazing in the afternoon so well worth the extra effort in cleaning them out of the pool in the summer!
Absolutely would book again!
Perfect for a family with kids and dogs. Our dogs are a bit bigger than usually allowed many but Louis was very kind to let us stay and we had almost zero issues. There are many squirrels in the area (only small issue we had with our dogs) so if you have extremely prey driven dogs maybe not the best choice but our two 60-70 lb dogs had a great time!"

Stayed one night","House is old dirty and roach infested with pet scents. We had a dirty pool and broken locks upon arrival and the back door doesn’t close and left us at risk all night with my kids inside. We killed one roach at night in the kitchen and we woke up to 6 all over the house mainly in the kitchen leaving my kids screaming in horror. Light bulbs burned out all over, floor was dirty closets full of garbage and clutter and pantry fridge and freezer had half eaten items inside. Furniture was broken in bedrooms and bathroom door doesn’t close. Gnats in the bathtub we didn’t use. Booked 12 days and left first morning and the owner was in the garage asking how long we will take to leave making it awkward. Super nasty experience do not stay here."

Just be aware that although the backyard is fenced, there is no fence directly around the pool. Backyard would be great for dogs! The heater was not working on the hot tub, but I'm sure the host will see to it. Just ask if it's fixed if it means that much to you. it's summer in Louisiana...the water was warm. Lol."

I would highly recommend this property to people with kids or animals he was very accepting of us bringing our dogs but we decided to not bring them last minute. kids loved the property mostly due to the pool, again Louis contacted me but this time with a call to walk me through the process of turning on the hot tub another great feature. Beds are very comfortable and house was very clean. Property is well worth the money and you will not be disappointed, thank you so much Louis can't wait to stay again"

Stayed with a pet","I booked the place solely for the pool I never used 😂. It looked just like the pictures. It also appeared to have steam coming from it. Being a cooler night, I’m assuming it was heated though I never checked. (It was a long travel day). The house smelled like dog but it wasn’t unbearable. It was prominent though, if you’re sensitive to that. It was a quick trip just to rest my eyes so I didn’t get to test the beds as I fell asleep on the couch. It was very comfortable. The house was very roomy, bigger than I expected. The house isn’t hard to find but it doesn’t have any numbers to identify it. I reached out and Louis responded almost instantly. I was very pleased with the response time, shocked almost at how fast! The location was very quiet too. I slept well here which is always an important outcome. Overall, the stay served it’s purpose."

Stayed with a pet","Louis had a very clean house and was quick to respond. There were a few issues that were a problem with our stay. There was no toilet paper in the entire house. Louis said he would send some over, which he did, but we weren't sure how long we could wait, being 5 people that just came off a 16 hour drive, so we went out to buy our own. We only had a few hours to swim before bedtime and leaving the next morning. Unfortunately, going out for the toilet paper took half our swim time. We also couldn't get the hot tub to turn on. We didn't have instructions. We think we understood it, but we kept getting an error message, that when looked up online, meant the filter system needed cleaning or another possible maintenance issue. We didn't message Louis because at this time it was 11PM, so we called it a night. There were also some very small ants in the master bathroom around the toilet seat area. There were no towel racks in the master bathroom, but mounts where they were supposed to be. These were minor things to me since we wanted to swim and only had a few hours there for the one night we stayed. I would probably stay there again since the backyard and porch were nice and relaxing and we needed the yard for the dog. Also, beds were extremely comfortable and check in was super easy. Hopefully, toilet paper will not be an issues again and the hot tub will get cleaned/fixed."

Stayed one night",Erika’s place was great! It was cold when we checked in and Erika turned on the heat for us before we got to the property so that was a great personal touch. The house was beautifully decorated for Christmas and I loved Erika’s personal touches with the Christmas decor. I make work trips frequently to Lafayette and plan on adding Erika’s place to my list of places to stay.

Stayed a few nights","We were disappointed with the housing. It's very beautiful, clean and in a quiet area. But it's not convenient, or really comfortable. There were no plates or bowls for meals and breakfasts. No support to put your belongings in the bedroom and bathrooms (decor everywhere). The mattress was very hard (yet we like firm mattresses) and the pillows really very big and hard. The absence of curtains woke us up early but if you're used to it wouldn't be a problem."

My husband sat on the cute deck outside In the morning. If we have another chance to visit Lafayette, Erika’s space will be our first choice!"

The AC unit is higher upper on the wall and so there were spots that were hotter than others like the bathroom and the far side of the bed that was under the AC. But that is a minor thing.

It's in an older sub-division in what I would call a diverse neighborhood. I appreciate that. It has a frige, microwave, and Keurig coffee maker. The small bathroom has a stand up shower stall. The double bed is comfortable and faces a TV with Netflix and many other viewing options. Erika was very friendly and showed me around the building and it's features. Overall, I give her an A+ for a job well done and keeping the place in good shape. I highly recommend it!"

From the walkway to the gate, to the little patio area filled with adorable twinkle lights to the wonderfully comfy bed and spotless, well decorated & appointed interior, she has thought of everything! I hope I passed muster as a guest, becauseI will want to stay here every time I come back to Lafayette."

Stayed with a pet","Overall our stay was good here. The unit has a private garage to park your vehicle in, which was kinda nice. Upon arriving the unit was clean and smelt clean when walking in. We were traveling with puppies, so the fenced in backyard was an added treat. One thing to note is that the thermostat for the HVAC unit is upstairs outside the master bedroom. It took us a while to find it. The unit had everything we needed and the host communicated effectively. We would stay here again if our travels ever bring us back to the area."

She was so kind and went out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed for our stay. Their place was spotless and there was lots of natural light filtering in through the windows which was a nice surprise. We cooked a lovely dinner and listened to Jazz for a great night in. It wasn't hard to channel vacation vibes here, it was perfect. Great location, beds, big bathrooms, and open floor plan. The desk and cute little reading nook was an added bonus too. We would totally stay here again!"

I enjoyed reading the storybooks to my daughter, the wonderful water temp in the soaking tub/shower, and the very comfortable beds. The kitchen is equipped with all of the essentials and the wifi worked great! I would only recommend placing a tv in the downstairs bedroom and fix the upstairs bathroom door. Overall, we had a perfect stay. I have definitely found my new spot when visiting Lafayette."

Stayed a few nights","Diana's place exceeded my expections, by a long shot! Located very conveniently to the airport, the two story space was impeccably clean and quite modern. There was more than enough space for 4 or more guests, and the neighborhood was quiet. The king size bed upstairs was VERY comfortable, and there were extra blankets, etc. available if needed. The kitchen cabinets were fully stocked with anything appliances/utensils you might need to prepare your own meals. There was also a garage available to park your car securely. I was in town to attend a funeral, so I didn't spend much time at the condo, but Diana easily accommodated my last-minute booking.
Suffice it to say, I'd recommend Diana's place to anyone visiting the Lafayette area who'd like to relax in a modern, upscale environment. ;)"

Stayed with kids","Nice place, not nice host!
We have evacuated from a HUGE hurricane that destroyed our city. We accidentally left my sons favorite jersey in the dryer and she text us letting us know her house cleaner would be throwing it out. Upon arrival there was dog hair all on the upstairs floor. My pants were covered in it when unpacking my clothes. They did not have a remote and advised “the precious guest must have stolen it” and said we could buy a new one... then we we left they accused US of stealing their Alexa! So clearly it is a trend to blame their guests on stealing items—may need to check with the house cleaner on that. We went through A LOT with our city being destroyed and this was the least empathetic person I came in contact with. Also, if you like a gift basket upon arrival (aren’t they so fun and special?) you will not get that here. I have stayed at TONS of air bnb and have NEVER had an issue. Hosts are always SO KIND like you’re literally their guest! You won’t get that here.
So again, super nice and cute place, but hostess was far from hospitable!"

Stayed a few nights","I’ll start by saying I’m 57 and have a bad spine and have about decided Airbnb is a young person’s game we’ll be trading for a boring hotel room with much more reliable mattress. However, if you’re healthy, this is a dream spot for Festival International in April! (We stayed Thurs through Sunday. I’ll say the queen mattress in the guest room was not too bad so fortunately I slept there) The place was huge, with great acoustics for streaming music on our wireless speaker, but mostly we enjoyed sitting bar stools up in the bay window for fantastic people watching/impromptu parades that went by. It was so nice to be able to break up the day on Saturday with lunch and respite from the sun in the room, as well as indoor plumbing. The furniture is vintage, which adds to the charm of the place, but isn’t particularly comfortable-probably would be fine for most though. NOTE: There is a refrigerator but NO FREEZER. Coffee is a drip with cone shaped filter. (We were told pod)"

Stayed a few nights","This is a huge, loft-style condo, right in the center of downtown, and right in the middle of everything. The front room is huge - combo living room / open kitchen. The master bedroom is huge with large bathroom with both jacuzzi tub and tiled shower, and double sink. The second bedroom is small but adequate. And the second bath is off the hallway and small but adequate with a tub/shower.
This is a one story walk up (a 2 story building), so be aware of that. The condo is over a bar/restaurant (not operating at the time of my visit), so you don't need to worry about disturbing anyone downstairs. You are in the heart off downtown, and it can be noisy at night when people are out partying, so not good for early to bed types.
There were a few maintenance issues, but I'm sure the owner is taking care of those. The place is very clean, freshly painted, beautiful old wood floors, lovely brick walls. Huge windows. Lots of light. I would rent it again!"

The location is fantastic—just a short walk from the ULL campus, which made it incredibly convenient for all the orientation activities. The neighborhood is lovely and peaceful, adding to the overall pleasant atmosphere of our visit.
Inside, the house is beautifully decorated with a perfect blend of modern amenities and historical touches. Each room is spacious and well-appointed, ensuring we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay.

Stayed a few nights","We are on a 2 month road trip and so far this was our favorite place. We loved that this house retained so much of its character and charm but had nice clean modern bathrooms. The house is beautifully decorated, extremely comfortable and has anything you would need and was close to anything we wanted. It became a joke that anything we input to Google maps was always a 4 minute drive from the house.
You can’t do any better than this place in Lafayette"

This house was incredible for all of our aesthetic needs. The kitchen has so much character- it was a dream to create food content in. We had some talent come in and out of the house and all remarked on how adorable it is.
Aside from a photoshoot, I think this place would be great for locals to book for Mardi Gras, Festivals Acadiens et Créoles and Festival Internationale. Walking distance to Downtown shopping and restaurants! Great location.
Our host was communicative and cared about our comfort. 10/10"

You can hear the train in the morning blowing it’s whistle. That’s a signature of Cajun country. The bayou well it’s just down the street. And that music. My god that music it reminds me of Cajun country.

I chose it for his proximity to the Amtrak station and now it will be my go to in the future. I requested to book at the last minute for a Sunday night stay and Teresa was very accommodating; messaging right away and answering any questions that I had. I think what I most loved about the place is the urban decor and that every detail is well thought of. You'll get a variety of cookware, a full kitchen, snacks, towels, bath supplies, coffee, earplugs... you name it, it has it. My stay on a Sunday night was quiet and peaceful, and I felt safe from the moment I arrived. Also a variety of restaurants are conveniently in walking distance. To sum up, I enjoyed my short stay and I can't wait to come back!"

Stayed with kids","Lovely place, as shown. Not really in the vibe of town, decor a little cold and not very themed in Lafayette. Nice location. The host communicates well but it's a bit of a copy and paste. It feels like there's a big machine behind. It's not someone who rents their living space. This is the public Airbnb. The building was built to collect live in series and you can feel it. All apartments are rented to tourists. I wouldn't be surprised if it was built especially for that. So less authentic experience that takes advantage of a platform that helps avoid the regulations of the hospitality industry. But we have what's shown for the price."

It was very convenient in downtown and we were able to walk everywhere. Even though it was very close to everything, it was very quiet and felt very private too.
Teresa our host was fantastic with everything. She was very good about giving clear instructions and was very prompt.
We would highly recommend this place and will definitely return! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

The only small inconvenience would be the surprising noisy internet box and the vibrations of the air conditioning of neighbors who reason in the bedroom. But thankfully everything calms down in the evening and that doesn't stop you from relaxing."

We had everything we needed and more including a full kitchen.
Great location in Downtown - we walked almost everywhere and had plenty of choices for cafes/restaurants/bars even on a quiet Sunday.
Teresa was easy to communicate with and gave clear instructions for check in and check out.
Would recommend!"

When we arrived there is a parking lot right next to the gate to get into the building, with a nice sitting area and a fire pit. The build is secure, just make sure you have your keys on you at all times, the doors lock behind you (I liked this a lot, being that the property is downtown). It can get a little noisey during the day inside the building because there are 4-5 other units, but at night it was perfectly quiet and we had no problems. I would absolutely stay here again. Teresa is an awesome host and is very responsive. Everything was very clean and she provided additional things like water bottles, granola bars, etc. 10/10 would recommend!"

The spaciousness of the unit exceeded our expectations. With three bedrooms, we had plenty of room to relax and unwind after long days of house hunting. The well-designed common areas, including the amazing deck, allowed us to spend quality time together as a family.
The tasteful decor was a standout feature. The interior design added elegance and warmth to the space, creating a welcoming atmosphere. We especially enjoyed the back porch with its beautiful tree, providing a peaceful spot to savor our morning coffee or unwind in the evening.
We will definitely return for future trips. Highly recommended!"

We loved the alligators on the sheets and the cajun themed rug at the entrance. We appreciated the kitchen and the washer dryer, especially because we're traveling for a few weeks.
Everywhere we wanted to visit, including local restaurants were easily accessible.
We enjoyed the patio and recorded so many beautiful birds during our stay.
We were able to extend our stay for a couple of days, thanks to our host. We appreciated the close and timely communication. This was one of the best Airbnb experiences we've ever had.
We plan on coming back in the Spring and hope we're able to stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","We were in Lafayette for the funeral of a family member. We had responsibilities that required us to be in town for a full week. Stella's Studio was very comfortable and welcoming and perfect for the two of us during our extended stay. The owners did a great job of creating a safe and comfortable place to stay. It was far above any hotel in Lafayette, and the studio arrangment gave us flexibility for relaxed meals in rather than eating out at restaurants for every meal. Comfortable furniture helped us relax in the evening without having to sit on a bed on an office chair such as we might expect in a hotel. The washer/dryer was a blessing as it relieved us of having to worry about running out of clean clothes as we went about our duties of closing out the home of the deceased loved one. Although this was a trip involving duties, we still have relatives in Lafayette, and we will certainly look to Stella's for accommodations on our more leisurely trips in the future."

This a great staycation or even if you are coming from out of town because it is very close to downtown! It feels like a fairytale. I think I might book again tonight! ❤️ thanks so much Stella! You are truly a Superhost!

I enjoyed my stay so much that I actually added an extra day. Everything was as described, even better. So much beautiful natural light comes through as well! And, the neighborhood is as walkable as everyone described and close to a lot of activities, while still being in a very safe and cute area.
Had some of the best nights of sleep on the beds, and the living room and couch area were great for movie nights. There were so many small, excellent and hospitable touches all around. Truly, this was a five-star experience. Will be back again!"

Stayed over a week","I came to Louisiana for a 2 week work project and stayed at Stella's studio home. There is a pin pad for locking/unlocking the door which I love because I never had to worry about losing a key or wondering where I put it.
The studio is bigger than you think but not too big for 1 person. When I arrived there was a welcome gift bag full of goodies and she knew I was coming from AZ and had Louisiana chips and Arizona Tea waiting for me. (also a bottle of wine!)
I had everything I needed for my stay: plenty of towels, a fully stocked kitchen, washer/dryer & cleaning supplies. I brought my Firestick but I didn't need it because there is a Roku Tv where I could download my own apps and they automatically delete upon checkout. (what a great idea!)
I was working 12 hour days and coming back to Stella's Studio felt like coming home. It was quiet and comfortable. Much better than a hotel room. If I ever find myself in LA again I will be staying here!"

Everything was clean, and since it was a last minute trip (I’m allergic to most detergents and lavender) Dana offered to bring over sheets washed in unscented detergent - but when I got there it was already unscented, so it was perfect! We walked the backyard and looked at the plants and Dana was kind enough to answer our questions about them. There is one firmer bed, and one softer bed- I chose the softer one and it was so comfortable!!"

Stayed a few nights","Four of us stayed here for Festival International, and it was the perfect base camp for quiet time and rest in between our time at Festival activities downtown. We appreciated the very quiet neighborhood and clean, open space in the living room and kitchen area to eat and socialize. All was as advertised."

Stayed a few nights","The home is situated in a quiet, older neighborhood. It was within 10 minutes of the Children's Museum of Acadiana and the Parc Sans Souci, both of which we thoroughly enjoyed."

Stayed a few nights","I can’t say enough wonderful things about our experience! The house was SO CLEAN, which is a big deal to me. As soon as I walked in the door, I was met with the smell of fresh and clean! It’s an older house that has been updated and the updates are perfect. I felt right at home. The neighborhood was so quiet and I never felt unsafe. It was perfect for us and we 100% would stay here again! The only thing I would say is maybe some extra shampoo because I forgot mine and we shared between both bathrooms. That’s it, that’s the only complaint I have and I wouldn’t even call it a complaint lol :)"

Stayed a few nights",The house had enough space for my needs. Felix resolved an issue quickly. I felt the need to wash all items before use because they were sticky or dusty to the touch. Home was comfortable and quiet.

Stayed a few nights","The home is located in a fairly well maintained ethnically diverse neighborhood. As a solo female traveler, I found the house to look exactly like the pictures – was very clean, peaceful and quiet. I slept like a baby. The backyard and patio area were divine. I spent the majority of my time out there. All it needed was a hammock to complete the tranquil vibe. Felix was quick with his responses and I would rent again if in the area."

Stayed with kids",We enjoyed our stay. The house was very clean and we did get to check in early. The yard is real nice. We enjoyed the covered patio a lot. The only problem I had was the refrigerator. It never got cold the whole weekend. Hopefully a new fridge is in the future.

Stayed over a week","I can't say enough about how great our stay was. We were in town working for a few months. Felix response was faster than anyone I have EVER spoke with EVERYTIME I messaged him. Worked with our schedule and allowed me to modify my reservation however we needed. Home was comfortable and had everything we needed. Extremely comfortable, peaceful neighborhood. He kept the grass cut and the trash picked up. If every place I ever have to rent was this great, life would be so much easier. Definitely can't say enough good things! Wonderful people to rent from! Thanks again!!"
