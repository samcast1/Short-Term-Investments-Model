Stayed a few nights","We have stayed at several Airbnbs and the Blue House on Main is one of the nicest! Very clean, beautifully decorated, comfortable beds, and so homey. Tina has the bathroom well stocked with anything you would need. She even has a snack basket in the kitchen with a good variety of snacks. This is something you don’t see at a lot of airbnbs. If you choose to stay here you won’t be disappointed!"

Stayed with kids","We decided last minute to book a stay since we were traveling to a wedding a few hours away from home with a 6 month old. I'm so happy we found the Blue House on Main. The location was extremely convenient, we went back to the house between the ceremony and reception so baby could take a tiny nap and get a break before dinner and dancing. Tina left great instructions for getting into the home and the home came with everything we needed and more. Feels like a luxurious stay beautifully finished and decorated. If we ever need a place to stay in Maryville again, we will definitely be back."

The home is located within walking distance of downtown restaurants and bars. Would definitely recommend to those needing a place to stay in Maryville.

If someone had forgotten something, the house had it! We were worried about rain at one point and saw that there were three umbrellas available if needed. Hair dryer, curling irons, snacks, condiments, coffee this house had it all. The beds were super comfy and the sheets smelled great! I highly recommend this place. It has one full bathroom and a half bath that worked just fine for our group of 6, but if you were staying here longer, you may run into showering issues. I would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed with a pet","This home is even more lovely in person. We are relocating from Alaska to the east coast and were looking for somewhere other than another chain hotel, to stay along the way. I’m so grateful for this beautiful stay. This home is extremely clean, reasonably priced, gorgeously decorated, in a safe area, and was the perfect home away from home for our family. If we are ever in the area again, we will without a doubt, stay here again.
The hostess even went out of her way to send someone with a can opener while I was cooking dinner, because the one that had been on site must have been removed by a previous guest. Even though it was no big deal to us, she insisted she wanted our stay to be comfortable-and it sure was.
Lastly I wanted to mention that the parking at the rear of the property was spacious enough for our full size SUV and 10’ cargo trailer which was also important to us.
Thank you for the wonderful stay."

Tons of room for our family of 5 (including three little boys). The house is wonderfully decorated and stocked full of every imaginable amenity. We have stayed at AirBNBs all over the world, and this was among the best."

The house is in a great location, easy to find and it was very clean. Lots of natural lighting, my son said they had the comfiest couch ever and the beds were perfect. We all felt at ease and were able to relax while we stayed in this house. The location is very close to campus and Main Street is close by, which makes driving around pretty easy. The house has AC and it worked perfectly to cool us off from the ""sticky heat"" my kids aren't used to yet. I highly recommend this listing to anyone looking for a place to stay in Maryville and will absolutely book again in the future if I need to. Thank you Josh!"

I was in town for work and it was a great location, but Ronda didn’t tell me that there was a boil order for town, and I drank the water. She completely disregarded my safety.
I will never stay at Ronda’s place even though I regularly travel to this beautiful area for work."

Stayed a few nights","Celebrating my daughters NWMSU graduation - this loft was absolutely perfect! The location, the space, the kitchen, the ease of loading in and out! We had a caterer and the space was ideal for it. Plenty of places to sit, relax, visit, eat! Everyone who came by loved the loft! The beds, towels, furniture - all wonderful! And we must take a moment for the master shower! <3 They were very communicative and accommodating to us! We shopped, ate, visited the bars and the weather cooperated enough that we enjoyed the deck and outdoor spaces. Would recommend and rebook with no hesitation!!
The ONLY thing I would definitely make sure either gets updated or discussed with the dog groomer downstairs - it definitely said they were closed on Friday in the booking. Those dogs barked constantly from 8am - 8pm Friday. It was pretty bad - especially with our grad party being Friday. So, they are not just grooming, they are boarding dogs while no one is there. Bring earplugs!"

We visit Maryville at least 2x/year and always look for one of their properties to stay in (and sad when they're already booked!). Without a doubt, the best accommodations and hosts in and around Maryville. Can't wait for our next visit!"

As others noted the loft is above a dog groomers, it did smell slightly of dog shampoo and the pups were pretty noisey but we are early risers and it wasnt a bother. Just know going in that the groomers below is open a few days during the week and dogs are going to be dogs!
10/10 would recommend and we would certainly stay there again!"

Stephanie was very quick to respond to any messages I sent and Maryville itself was a cute little town. A little heads up.. The loft itself is located above a dog groomer that is open like 3 days a week. We were there for one of their open mornings and you could clearly hear every bark through the floor from the time they opened til they closed. We're early risers so it didn't bother us..And the beautiful loft more than made up for it. The little balcony off the master bedroom gave a super cute view to a fountain and the town below. And there's a full backyard with a firetable, grill and comfy seating that I wish we wouldve had more time to utilize. Would love to stay here again and definitely recommend this loft to any and everyone. Thanks again! ❤️"

We have stayed at numerous Airbnb's across the states and this was our absolute favorite! The inside is decorated so cute, stocked with all you would need, and immaculately clean. The little court yard and balcony off the master bedroom are an added bonus! The location couldn't be any better. It is right on the square and within walking distance of so many cute shops and places to eat. One of our favorite parts was the double shower in the master bathroom. So relaxing and fun!

The sun rising behind us as we headed west, lit up the recently cut fields in a golden hue. We arrived to this place at dark and left at dawn. We had everything we could ever need including snacks, toiletries, etc. Bathroom was great- warm and powerful shower. We slept great in the comfortable bed. Our dogs did great there and we all relaxed. The dogs loved the yard and we could walk them around on their leash after a long car ride. In fact, the entire place felt comfortable. We will be back in February for the snow geese migration."

My daughters and I were traveling back to Texas from Iowa and we were looking for a safe pet friendly hotel… this exceeded that with a beautiful, large spacious apartment. All the amenities you could think of, from q-tips and other bathroom toiletries, to a variety of coffees/sugars/creams, snacks in the kitchen that I thought were so thoughtful! If I’m ever traveling through again I would happily drive out of the way just to stay again. It’s so refreshing to see someone take so much care with the space they’re providing to others and have such thoughtful touches added to their places."

Lake with beach and fishing docks, golf course, and occasionally golf balls🤣..all good. Overall excellent cottage.."

Stayed a few nights","The place was clean and worked out for a place to sleep while my wife and I were visiting our daughter in Maryville.
It would have been nice to have a hair dryer and the coffee pot provided was something I had never seen before. An inexpensive automatic drip coffee maker would have been much better.
Also was tricky getting up and down from the sleeping loft but that's more age related.
Overall my wife and I made it work but probably would not stay there a 2nd time."

Stayed a few nights",I am from Burlington Junction so know the area well. The house was hard to find at night since it is down a gravel drive behind the main house. Mike was so helpful and responsive when I had trouble working the lock as well as guiding me to the house. The house is cute and the mattresses are both very comfortable. Perfect for two people. The spiral stairs are a bit scary for tall people but a great way to maximize space. Overall a great experience.

Stayed a few nights","I was visiting my kiddo at school and didn't need anything fancy. These things might not bother some people but it was just several smallish things that made the stay annoying.
Upon arrival the house temp was 59 degrees. It was freezing cold and took a while to get to a comfortable temp. The main living room picture on the listing shows a picture of an actual sofa and the listing says it's a pull out sofa. It's actually a futon, which isn't the same thing. The futon was not comfy even for a college student.
There was no body soap as listed and we didn't bring any since it showed it was provided.
The shower doesn't work very well. Screaming loud and only half the water comes out of the showerhead.
There is an overpowering floral smell with so many plug in fresheners throughout the house. I don't get headaches but I had one all weekend even though I unplugged them all.
The bed sheet on the queen bed was put on sideways. Again, nothing crazy but just annoying."

Stayed a few nights",We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Maryville! The townhouse was easy to find on a main street near the downtown but in a quiet neighborhood. It was beautifully decorated and set up in a way that gave us plenty of space and was impeccably clean. The bathroom is small but has a great tub/shower with lots of hot water and good water pressure. The kitchen was well equipped and we enjoyed sitting at the dining table for our in-house meals. Best for us was that it was within walking distance of the downtown where there are several good restaurants and a brew pub. We could also walk to the courthouse and the Nodaway County Historical Society where we were doing genealogy research. Kelsey was very prompt and wonderfully friendly in all of my communications with her. We would definitely choose to stay here again and highly recommend it to others.

They did a really nice job rehabbing and redecorating an old home, but some finishes fell a little short for comfort (very uneven floor in kitchen, very dim light in the bathroom, no frills ""extras"" like shampoo and soap, no dishwasher). Cute place that I'd recommend for a short stay though!"

Stayed with kids","Upon check in the cleaning person was leaving yet when we got in the home there was left over food in the refrigerator, cabinets, and the freezer. The freezer had sticky brown stuff in it, there was also dirty dishes in the oven, dirty looking cups in the cabinet and there was a left over coffee pod in the coffee maker and when we opened it there was fruit Flys or Nats that flew out. There was also some mold in the coffee maker and the bathroom trash was full. We had to also have an exterminator come the second day we were there due to ants and other bugs. The host did have a quick response and the cleaning lady came back fast to correct the issues as well as the exterminator was quick to show up. The floors are also pretty uneven, the washer and dryer are down in the cellar, we didn't wash any clothes as there was a mold or wet wood odor down there. They do have kids toys, a pack and play, and a booster highchair that straps to the dining room chairs. Overall it was an okay experience after most of the issues were fixed."

Keep in mind that all bedrooms are up classic wooden steps - caution for our older parents that stayed and avoid stocking feet. With that in mind, the wooden stairs are part of the charm.
Food had been left in the trash by the cleaners, but the hosts were very responsive and offered to deliver sprays for smell.
We would stay here again based on the charm of the home and responsive, friendly communication with Jordan. Also great that we could do a single night stay for a Thursday game."

They were very open in their descriptions about the house being older, so the house does have some chipping paint, like on the porch and windows, but I never felt like that made it feel dirty or uncomfortable. It was so clean and decorated nicely, with nice linens, that the stuff they noted didn’t even really affect our comfort. It is a very cool old house and we felt very comfortable and had everything we needed."

The house is exactly as described. The ensuites with each bedroom is a huge plus - in addition to the guest bath off the kitchen. We watched a couple of movies on the couch with 5 people and our dog at our feet. Lots of space.
A couple of very minor things to consider is that, while there are bars of soap provided, remember to bring shampoo, lotion and other necessities like coffee grounds for the coffee maker. Plus, the space around the pool table is a bit limited, so the host has provided shorter cues.
Overall, cute little town and we'll be back soon!"

Stayed a few nights","I stayed in The Loft while working in Maryville and loved it. It is as nice as it appears in the pictures. It is on Main St with a great view of downtown. The bedroom is in the back part so it is wonderfully quiet. There is a good restaurant a very short walk to the south. I would definitely stay here again. Stephanie and Kent likely have this somewhere in the info but (maybe because I am a health care provider so I think about this), I did want to remind people with mobility difficulties, this is a Loft, and you need to be able to climb a moderately long flight of stairs to reach it."

And our favorite football player #57 came over and visited. We had plenty of space to visit. It was -degrees outside and our place stayed warm. Stephanie is great with communication any and everything you need. You could barely hear the axe throwing happening.

Stayed a few nights","We were in town visiting for a wedding at Something Borrowed, this was a really great location for that purpose as it’s only 2 blocks away! I spent some time reminiscing of my old college days when I lived next door (now the park) and enjoyed being so close to the square.
The loft was perfect for the 2 of us, and had everything we needed for a few nights stay and even had extras like Keurig pods, blow dryer, q-Tips, shampoo and body wash etc.
Decor was really cute (gotta love IKEA!) and the bed was VERY comfortable. No issues whatsoever. Easily recommend to others and we will definitely be back!"

When checking in you feel safe with multiple measures of security. When meeting the owners they were super accommodating. One can feel they want the future of Maryville to thrive with local businesses that accommodate students,parents and those traveling for work. After searching thoroughly these are the best short term rental options in the city. Would recommend to others and return ourselves."

The hours I needed a place to stay were 7am till about 1030pm. When I say last min I mean last min I messaged Stephanie at maybe 1 or 2am and before my shift was over at 7am she messaged me and told me she could accommodate me and immediately excepted my reservation 😭😭.. I was sooo tired I couldn’t even see straight!! The place is so beautiful and well kept. It’s squeaky clean and looks exactly like the photos. I will definitely will be staying with her again should I catch a shift out that way ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Stayed with kids","It’s hard to find a place to stay in this town (that’s not a hotel), and this house was perfect. It was the only option with multiple bedrooms and TWO bathrooms. Fully functional, well appointed kitchen with lots of k-cup options ;) (hope we weren’t too greedy - it was so nice to have hot drinks when it’s so cold outside). Two nice living rooms (one upstairs and one in basement) which allowed kids to get some space. The house was definitely family friends and we appreciate that. Also, my personal favorite was the bedding was super soft and they even had foam pillow options which is rare. Zaida was very responsive and thoughtful; she even offer to have the snow shoveled for us!"

The backyard and deck is really nice to sit for a drink in the evening or coffee in the morning the host was responsive and flexible. We didn’t cook there so I can not comment on kitchen equipment. We also did not use the TV, therefore I cannot comment on that either. Nice place, safe neighborhood. We would definitely book again."
