Stayed one night","Absolutely beautiful surroundings, comfy bed and room with pastoral views, lovely host and family, absolutely clean & quiet, yummy fresh eggs right from the chickens for breakfast with great coffee in the morning, and the goats are adorable! You can get there really quick from 83, but I came from the west on amazing backroads from Dresden to their place. It was magical. I’m allergic to dogs but I was fine—their 11 “puppy dogs” are hypoallergenic, super well-behaved, very quiet and clean, stayed out of my room, and were darling. Can’t wait to go back!"

The host was very communicative and provided very clear directions for everything. We loved all the amenities provided and there were lots of things that other places don’t usually have like lots of cookware, spices, bathroom supplies, plenty of blankets, pillows and towels if needed. For the same price as a hotel room in the area you can have a whole place to yourself. Will definitely stay again when in the Zanesville area!"

Kellie had a terrific list of really fun and interesting places to visit in her guidebook. We hit lots of them. We loved having our coffee on the big, private deck and a nice campfire in the side yard fire pit. This is absolutely the most comfortable Airbnb we've stayed at so far!! A real gem!"

It is a peaceful location. Kellie was extremely accommodating and helpful, providing us with all the information we needed and being available to answer any questions we had. We will definitely stay at Kellie’s cottage when we are in Zanesville next!"

You can spend your whole stay inside looking at small personal touches and playing indoor activities, or spend it outside with plenty of options from the hot tub, fishing, exploring the property, or a fire by the pond. Gregory is a great host, with plenty of local recommendations, and very responsive. There is no details missed with fishing gear, firewood, anything you would possibly need readily available at the cabin. Can’t wait until our next stay."

The attention to detail was nothing short of amazing and the Christmas decor was fabulous! There was even an elf in the shelf hidden in our closet and a lovely card and little gift bags with mugs and hot cocoa for our family of 4! The OSU decor was a bonus (I’m a Buckeye!) and Greg and his wife Erin answered all of our questions promptly. The town of Cambridge is adorable around Christmas and we made a wonderful memory. Can’t say enough positive things about this place.

We fished the fully stocked pond and was not disappointed. It should be noted that there is a significant slope from the cabin to the dock making it difficult for some older people. Would recommend steps for easier accessibility. We saw foxes, deer, and heard lots of bull frogs during our stay. Defiantly recommend this cabin and look forward to staying there in the future."

Stayed a few nights","Great location relative to downtown Cambridge. Guests should know that ground floor bedroom is right on the street. If you're a light sleeper or might be woken up by street noise/ light this probably isn't the place for you. Blackout curtains would certainly help. Unit is large (significantly larger than a nearby hotel option) and has lots of character. We appreciated the seasonal decor but the snow covered steps/sidewalk and frozen shower pipes (shower would not drain during our entire stay) certainly detracted from the experience. The host informed us over the phone that with the with the warmer weather coming later that the pipes were likely to thaw and that a handyman would come by to check the pipes after we left. Great for the plumbing, not great if you've driven 300+miles and are hoping to take a shower during your stay. Would consider staying again, but perhaps in warmer weather."

(for this particular suite, enter the code and hit the LOCK button, since there is no “unlock” button) Our only regret is we wished we could have stayed longer.

Stayed a few nights","We had seen the picture on AirBnB of this Downton Abbey Suite, but when we opened the door and walked in - we were still ""wow'd"". My husband and I were travelling for 2.5 weeks staying in 5 different areas - and this was our 3rd of 5 stays. We rotate between historic hotels and AirBnBs and it was awesome to find an AirBnB that was also historical. Carol has paid attention to the details that matter when you are in a home away from home. The linens and towels are top notch (and plenty of towels). She left us two delicious blueberry muffins from the local Kennedy's bakery, Great instructions for accessing the WiFi and cable TV. A large kitchen trash can. Coffee and individual creamers - just nice touches like that. The location was perfect with just a block or two to walk to several different dining options (although we had a kitchen, so we did cook for ourselves one night). This is a safe neighborhood. We had a small issue when entering the code to get into the apartment when we first arrived. I called her number and she responded immediately and we were in (we had to pull the door snug toward us as the lock was catching - no big deal). We also called her when we left to let her know and she was right there. There is so much to do and see in this area - and you can't go wrong with this place. Very special! We don't normally vacation in the same place twice, but if we are ever back in Cambridge - we'll be staying here."

Stayed one night","This place was great for five college students needing a cheap place to stay for one night. However, it wasn’t until the day of the check in that we were informed of the steep hill and the need for 4WD. Luckily we had one car able to get up the hill, but the other car had to be left at the bottom, and we had to walk the luggage up the hill. We feel that it definitely needs to be stressed in the description that you may not be able to stay here if you don’t have a car able to get up extremely steep, unpaved, and bumpy hills. Once inside, we found multiple bugs in each room, and when making dinner, the dishes had to be washed out before we used them due to visible debris. Other than that, the house fit the description and we had a great time, just slightly put off by the hill and bugs."

The kitchen was well equipped and there were a ton of fresh towels and washcloths. It was a great luxury to have a washer and dryer. Kelly has a binder with local businesses. We tried Theo’s restaurant and it was great. So great, we ended up returning 4 times. I enjoyed a hot bamboo massage at Zona’s spa. The owner was great and the price was so reasonable. The beds were super comfortable. It was really a great time. I don’t want to leave out the driveway that is mentioned in so many of the reviews. We did not find it difficult at all.

I kept a steady pace and took the u-turn wide right and had no problems. I had to go past the drive way and come in from the other direction. It was absolutely worth the scary adventure!

Stayed with kids","Our family of six so enjoyed our time at Kelly's cabin. It was clean and actually even nicer than we expected from the pictures. It was very quiet even the road down at the bottom of the hill there is very little to no traffic. Salt Fork State Park was fairly close by and our family was able to go out for several different hikes. Cambridge town was very cute and we enjoyed going and seeing the different Christmas displays and Christmas lights at the courthouse. We have four kids ranging from 8 months to 9 years old and the place accommodated us well. There was no Wi-Fi and for us this was great! We enjoyed playing games, cooking, doing puzzles, exploring the property, watching a movie :-).
When Kelly tells you that you need four-wheel drive we would highly recommend that! We had issues getting up the driveway with our Honda Odyssey the first night with the snow and ice. The last day we made it all the way up to the cabin. We did get a little bit of damage under the front of the van."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I are from the flatland of North west Ohio. We like going to mountainous areas on vacation. It is true the driveway is a challenge. Our first trio up it was not graceful. We did make it. We have a Ford Explorer. It has all wheel drive. We have not had it very long. We are not used to all wheel drive. We also are inexperienced with that type of terrain. It got easier the more times we went up the driveway. The trick is to not stop while going up the driveway. Another trick is not turn sharp at the turn midway. Go almost into the grass and then turn. The gem is what awaits you after you conquer the driveway. The cabin is in a quiet and peaceful area. It is clean and has many extras. Salt Fork State Park is not that far away. It well kept. We went hiking there two different days. The town of Cambridge is really nice as well.
All in all, if given the chance we would go back."

Beds were comfortable and kitchen had all you needed with plates, cups, pans, pots, coffee maker, etc. The porch is great and very relaxing. Grill had plenty of charcoal and lighter fluid. Fire pit well stocked with wood. No bug issues at all. Plenty of hot water for all showers (5 people). Lovely relaxing location . 4wd or Awd very recommended to navigate driveway. No problems experienced the entire time we were there. We all discussed and agree we will be coming back for another stay. This southern Ohio region is beautiful and the scenery is exceptional. Kelly made sure all was good with us. Outstanding!"

Stayed with kids","The cabin was quiet and isolated as described. Kelly was very communicative and did reach out to ask how everything was.
However, the cabin itself was not what we expected. There were many bugs (between me and my wife we killed at least 15 and found several more dead moths on window sills etc). Millipedes, spiders, stink bugs, etc.
The cabin also had a very strong order that smelled almost like trying to cover up a smell. We had to wash everything we brought with us to remove the smell.
Before we booked we had chatted with the host and she said the cabin sustained damage from a storm but repairs would be completed a month before our stay. When we stayed the ceiling was half painted, there were cracks in the drywall and molding was missing in a couple rooms. I'm not sure if this was related to storm damage or not.
Additionally, we briefly tried to turn on the TV/DVD player and found the TV didn't work. The picture color was distorted and the TV did not have working sound.
We had to leave our stay early for personal reasons, and Kelly did offer us a refund, however we did not cancel our last day and I don't think it's fair to deny the host our rental when we left unexpectedly early.
Kelly did ask during our stay if everything was ok with the cabin, however we didn't explain the issues. There was nothing anyone could reasonably do to fix a dirty, smelly bug filled cabin in a day. I did tell her the TV wasn't working, but she had no comment on that."

Stayed a few nights","We were running ahead of schedule and asked if our Air Bnb would be ready a half hour early. Kelly said she was in Texas and her daughter was cleaning and would let me know when it was ready. Check-in time is listed as 3:00 but she did not let me know it was ready until 3:32. All other properties we have stayed in gave us the lockbox code for the key 24 hours ahead of time, but it wasn't until I asked for it that morning that it was provided to us (I like to know ahead of check-in in case I don't have signal, etc.).
Prior to booking, I read reviews and many stated 4-wheel drive is necessary to get up the driveway. We do not have a vehicle with that ability so we I messaged Kelly to ask if that really was needed and she said it was not. Then when she responded to my question about the lockbox code, she said she recommends 4 wheel drive. Getting up the driveway was a pretty scary experience, and I should have listened to the reviews. It's very steep, has a couple sharp turns, and has several ruts. I wasn't sure if we were going to make it up. Coming downhill was easier, but we scraped the bottom of our car. From that point on we just parked at the bottom of the driveway and walked up and down.
Underneath the porch there were old mattresses, several bags of trash, and other junk. The walkway to the door was blocked by a pile of firewood that had fallen over. The home has a wrap-around porch which was the only thing we actually enjoyed about the property. Although the porch table was filthy and we had to clean it off. There was a cooler on the porch full of rain water and a wheelbarrow by the fire pit was also full of rain water.
Inside, there were bugs everywhere we looked. The floor, walls, ceiling, curtains, furniture, etc. Mostly millipedes but also ants, stink bugs, and other insects. I live in the country so I'm used to some bugs getting in, but this was disgusting. We wore shoes the entire time because we were stepping on a bug every time we turned around. The walls had paint peeling off, cobwebs on ceiling fans, there were food particles in the sink, the master bedroom closet door was falling apart, there was hair in the bathroom sink, shower, and floor, black spots on the inside of the shower curtain (likely mold), a moth and other bugs in the dryer, and the place was all-over dirty and not kept up with well.
Upon opening the fridge we found a case of beer with an empty bottle, and a lunch bag of tuna pouches and a container of leftover hamburgers. There was also a pasta strainer in the freezer(?).
I have sensitivities to fragrances so I requested room sprays and air freshener plug-ins not to be used, as well as our sheets and towels washed in free & clear detergent. As far as I could tell, our sheets and some of the towels were (some still had fragrance), but there were four air-wick plug-ins throughout the house, which was irritating.
At this point, we were looking for other Air Bnb's or VRBO's to stay in. Unfortunately for us there were none available in the area that short of notice, and we would have left to stay in a hotel, had it not been for the cooler of food we brought that needed to be kept refrigerated.
The burners on the stove are very uneven, which made cooking frustrating, but doable. Some of the cooking utensils definitely should be replaced, for instance there was a plastic spoon that had pieces of plastic coming off, and a pot with the coating scratched up. There were enough utensils/cooking equipment for what I needed, but none of it was great quality and it was a pretty random assortment. The coffee maker was also dirty and had old grounds in it, and the kitchen trash can still had trash in it.
The bed was decently comfortable, but when I stripped the bed before we left, I found a ton of little hairs at the foot of the fitted sheet.
Maybe this was just a one-off because of the other good reviews, but we didn't feel like we could relax at all because of the unkemptness of the home and property. We tried to spend as little time as possible at the home and have never been so relieved to check-out. I do not take leaving negative reviews lightly as I truly try to see things in a positive light and help hosts out by leaving good reviews, but we did not enjoy our stay and can't believe we paid money to stay here. I would not recommend this Air Bnb to anyone."

Stayed with kids","Arrived around 10:30 pm, March 17. The spring peepers were making a wonderful noise across the road. Wish we would have had more time to spend lounging around there; beautiful setting. 4 wheel drive is recommended. It rained Friday and we struggled a bit to get up the driveway, but we made it in our full size Chevy van."

The kids moaned the entire way home that they wanted to go back to the cabin!! None of us wanted to leave!!! Thank you, again, Alissa!

Stayed a few nights","Quiet, seclusion, nature's beauty. We LOVED not having internet or cell service. We had a lovely valley view where we watched an incredible lightning show in the evening and watched butterflies and birds during the day. The sounds of crickets, birds and frogs filled the air. The cabin was spotless and comfortable. The screened porch allowed us to enjoy the nature without getting mosquito bites. I hated to leave this place and would highly recommend it."

Only negative is no WiFi. Phone service was a little spotty at times also.
But if you want to just get away and relax. I highly recommend it."

She has books and movies and board (& video) games for use. Outside charcoal grill and full kitchen. Wonderful.
The place has well water so if you don't like the taste, plan to bring water.
We will definitely visit again."

She provided firewood (I ended up forgetting a lighter the first night the second night I was too tired from hiking so we didn’t actually build a fire) but there is a wonderful space to do so. Everything was clean and thoughtfully designed.

Stayed a few nights","This review is not for Alissa, she already knows we loved staying in the cabin. This is for anyone thinking of staying here. This place is great. The cabin has the necessities and is super-clean. But the setting!! That's what is so amazing. Most of the 4 days we were there, it rained, but sitting on the screened-in porch with a cup of coffee, & a good book, it didn't even matter. We watched the birds at the feeder, listened to the sounds of the natural world, and just relaxed. One night, we had a bonfire, and as night fell, we looked around and realized that the *only* light we could see was from our cabin, and our fire. No other houses. No headlights. Heavenly. Then we heard coyotes in the distance, and saw glow worms in the grass, twinkling like lightning bugs!!
I think fewer than 10 cars drove by on any given day we were there. This is the perfect place to unplug, re-set, and enjoy the land. Thanks for everything, Alissa!!"

Stayed a few nights","When I made the reservation for the Valley View cabin, I (mistakenly) assumed I'd be able to use my mobile phone's data plan during my stay. ""Even your sister who lives in the Tetons has service at her cabin"", I said. This turned out to be a very erroneous assumption on my part--that's how remote the location of Alissa's cabin is. If I had a dollar for every time I mistakenly assumed something...anyway, as a result I was ""forced"" (albeit surprisingly and blissfully so) to unplug and enjoy the books I'd brought, as well as my surroundings. This cabin is beautifully and thoughtfully decorated and has everything you need for some time ""off the grid."" The VERY nearby state park has tons of hiking trails that are easy to find and well blazed. Even someone like me who is usually terrible at reading maps (though not so much anymore, as a result of this weekend!) can find their way. At the cabin, the biodiversity of the surrounding wildlife is impressive. As I sat on the screened in front porch and watched the sunset on Saturday, I also watched a red and green hummingbird make a serendipitous appearance. In sum, I was able to leave Alissa's cabin with a deep sense of gratitude and peace--which is exactly what I'd wanted."

Stayed a few nights","First off, let me say Alissa's cabin is beautiful. Perfectly secluded and tastefully decorated. Comfortable and homey. We had a great time during our stay.
Secondly, I must give praise where praise is due. Due to a complete misunderstanding on my part, the cabin needed an a/c window unit installed when we arrived about 7pm on Friday. The weather was more humid and hotter than expected. It was late Friday evening when I called Alissa about the issue. In less than 10 mins she was at the door and 15 mins more she was done with installing a very nice a/c window unit. This goes to show the amount of pride Alissa has in her cabin and the level to which Alissa is a completely selfless airbnb owner.
We had a terrific time in the cabin and, if in the area, we will definitely be back!"

The internet & TV worked well, we made several meals in the kitchen, did laundry, and there is a nice little sunporch on the back that our kids claimed as their own for playing in."

Group trip","My friends and I recently stayed at an Airbnb that left us with mixed feelings. The house itself was impressively roomy, providing ample space for our group. However, our overall experience was tinged with an unsettling vibe, as the place bore an uncanny resemblance to a funeral home.
The spaciousness of the house was undoubtedly a plus, offering us comfort and freedom to move around. Unfortunately, the décor and ambiance were reminiscent of a place with a more solemn purposed. Medicine cabinets, large mirror, wide basement stairs and antique furniture added to the eerie atmosphere. One peculiar feature that stood out was a mini surgical sink tucked away in one of the bedrooms. While it may appeal to some as a unique touch, for us, it contributed to the unsettling undertones of the house. It felt out of place and left us questioning the design choices.
Despite the creepy vibes, the Airbnb was clean, and the host was accommodating."

Stayed with a pet","The home and yard felt safe for both human and dogs (something hotels often fail). Truly large enough home to comfortably hold the 6 people it can sleep, including availability of extra bathroom facilities. Two large flat-screen smart TVs, good Wi-Fi. Car port facilitates loading/unloading car in bad weather. Large mowed lawn area to enjoy, wish we had more time to enjoy outdoor fire pit.
Labeled as out of order: dish washer and wood burning stove.
Outdated electrical: difficult to find accessible grounded AC outlets (several outlets had ""cheater plug"" adapters, no GFI plug in bathrooms. Bedroom ceiling fans turn off when light turned off for the night (and only one chain on ceiling fan, to turn off the fan when light stays on). Would have been nice to use ceiling fan in dark room over night.
However, we made do with the outdated electrical, and everything else was fine. We hope to stay there again."

Stayed with kids","Book this stay!!!
The home, the yard, the neighborhood, the area, the host-all of it made our experience so much fun.
The house- There is so much space. You can spread out so much or all gather in the living space.
Stocked with everything you need in the kitchen if you want to cook.
Coffee area all set up to go!
There are also guidebooks left for you so you can plan any/everything during your stay.
The yard and neighborhood- The yard is gorgeous. So much room for the kids to run around and we took full advantage of the whole yard, basketball hoop, front porch area, and picnic table. The neighborhood is adorable and quite a few neighbors waved bye to us as we were leaving.
The area- You are tucked away on a quiet street but you can get to the historic Cambridge downtown area in minutes.
We loved McKenna’s Market, Kennedy’s Bakery, and Ladders Coffee. City Park and Parkside Tasty Treat ice cream shop are a must if you have kids.
The host- Cindy is the best. Quick to respond, helpful, and so sweet.
If you want a small town, quiet, laid back visit but still have plenty of things to do a short drive away, then this is your home base.
If you just want to be lazy and enjoy coffee on the front porch all week, then this is also your stay.
We will make it a point to look for this home if we do another cross country tour."

I walked around in white socks the entire time we were there and my socks were never once dirty or dingy. I’ve not found many Airbnb’s that clean. The rooms were very spacious and the playroom/toy nook in the upstairs was perfect for our four kids along with the foosball table and the basketball arcade game in the basement. If you’re debating on whether to stay or not, just book it! You will not be disappointed. We plan to stay again sometime next summer so we can utilize the in-ground pool. Brian was very responsive and a great host. We’re looking forward to our next stay!"

The pool was perfect for some very hot, sunny days and we could all gather and eat our meals in the huge, beautiful and well stocked kitchen.
They had so much more than any other vacation home we’ve ever stayed - we didn’t have to want for anything!
Thank you so much for such an amazing stay - we are already looking for future dates to return!"

It’s not a great place if you’re over 5’5”, the shower is extremely small, as well as the toilet. The bed frame was annoying and hard to move out of the way from, constantly stubbing toes. The rugs under the beds are nice, however I stepped on a small screw which obviously hurt. It really is a charming place, just dated. Even smells like grandma’s house."

Stayed with kids","We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this Airbnb in New Concord, Ohio. The apartment was cozy, clean, and well appointed. The fire pit was amazing, and the swing set was very enjoyable for our grandchildren. The deck in the back had a great, peaceful view, and the sunrises were beautifully viewed from the larger of the two bedrooms’ window. Linda is absolutely precious and enjoyable to visit with!!! We feel we’ve made a friend for life and hope to use the Airbnb again when needed!!!"

The furniture was super comfortable, the bed was super comfortable, and it was overall such a homey vibe and we loved it. l have to say - this stay was 10000% better because of the dog….she was literally the friendliest dog ever and we frequently went back out to get our pets in when she was outside. We loved her so much!!! The outside in general was so incredibly relaxing. Beautiful trail and land overall and we absolutely loved hanging out in the hot tub and making a fire in the little fire pit. Super cute market across the street was so close it was walkable and we just loved our experience. We can’t wait to come back here ❤️"

Stayed with a pet","Extremely relaxing place. All that it looks like and more . The dog, Willow, was such a lovely addition that it was hard to say good bye. She is a total sweetheart and got along wonderfully with our fur baby. She should be a featured attraction! The location was perfect for us because it was half the distance to Columbus and right between where we live. Excellent local restaurants and the hot tub was relaxing, as was the nature walk right behind the house. The recommendations by Carolyn for food are spot on for whichever type of food you prefer. Highly recommended! 5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Still miss Willow and would like to give her one more belly rub"

The bunker house was spotless and so incredibly welcoming and well decorated. I felt right at home! I loved that I could bring my dog along and she loved running the property with Willow, the official bunker mascot and greeting crew! The location is wonderful, especially if you want to get out and walk the property, make sure you bring your hiking boots! Both Carolyn and Jason were very responsive with any questions or issues that came up. The city of Cambridge has some really cool shops downtown, I thoroughly enjoyed Black Cat Vintage, walking around downtown and checking out random stores, as well as dinner to go from 360 Burger - it was delicious! Absolutely wonderful getaway! Before I was checking out, I was already checking my calendar for dates when I can return again! Thank you, Carolyn and Jason!"

This was a ladt minute escape, from the campground i was staying at. We had Severe storms and multiple tornado warnings expected.
I was very frightened, and when i found the ""BunkHouse"" , i was instantly relieved.
Carolyn worked above and beyond to accommodate my last minute request.
Her home was so welcoming, and unique.
I highly recommend !!!
Thank you do much, Carolyn"

Our favorite feature was definitely the hot tub. The string lights overhead were so pretty too! We also appreciated having the fridge and oven. It was something we didn’t think we’d use but it was so convenient that we made a quick Walmart run and did a little bit of cooking during our stay. We were so grateful that cooking tools were provided.
The property was incredible, very spacious for a studio, and immaculately clean. We would not hesitate to stay again and recommend to others. If you have the opportunity, definitely stay here! 💗
An honorable mention has to be the hosts’ dog, Willow. She is so adorable, incredibly well-trained, and sweet! I miss her already lol!"

They even personalized my stay with a nice touch with a welcome on the butchers paper dispensary. The host have extraordinary and great amenities and the hot tub with the outside lighting was just the relaxing atmosphere I needed. And another huge surprise was in the morning the views were extremely pleasant and just a great start to the day. Your dog is such a ham and so well behaved. And can’t wait to visit again hopefully longer soon. This place is the perfectly priced little getaway.

Stayed about a week","I loved everything about this cute little bunker. The location was great for me and the place was exactly as described on the listing.
Bed was super comfortable. The couch does turn into a futon bed, however I don’t think it would be suitable for an adult. A child would fit nicely on the couch bed.
Even thought the floors are concrete, the bunker stayed nice and warm and cozy!
My only suggestion would be maybe add a full length mirror.
Also, we never could get connected to the Wi-Fi router. The host did offer to help get it connected, but I was just too tired to mess with it so I just used my phone data while there.
Other than that, it was perfect and I will definitely be staying again when I visit my family!
I would recommend this bunker to any single travelers or a couples!
Thanks Carolyn!"

It looks exactly like the pictures they have posted. It is a small clean studio, perfect for our needs. The hot tub was a great way to end a busy day. We did some hiking, kayaking and spent some time at the beach at Salt Fork State Park. There are plenty of restaurants in the area and several small stores if you need to pick something up. It was a very nice place to stay."

My senior dog had fun exploring the lawn. It was nice to have everything on one level at the house as stairs can be a challenge for him. We had a great stay.
After I checked out, Carolyn was even so kind as to let me know I had forgotten something at the house. I was able to go back and pick it up."

There is a long atv trail that branches off into different directions, I strongly encourage exploring each way. It is not a short walk to the fire pit though so make sure you plan ahead if you want to make use of the provided smores supplies. Carolyn was very kind and accommodating of my check-in needs.

So, it was a very pleasant surprise to stay at an Airbnb with a hot tub that works. It was pure bliss to soak in the hot tub after a day of driving. Many thanks!"

Stayed a few nights","Everything was as pictured / described. Easy check in process with the key code door. We slept well in the bed. There were plenty of extra towels, washcloths, and blankets. There is a keurig and a nespresso machine with pods available. The mini xmas tree and small holiday decor gave the place an additional warm touch.
It's basically a studio layout with no real doors (just curtains) separating the bedroom from the living room / kitchen area and the bathroom from the bedroom, which was totally fine for my boyfriend and I, but if you're bunking with anyone you'd feel shy pooping around, that variable may be a problem hahaha.
The shower is tight quarters so if you're a very large person, you may feel cramped, but it's fine for an averaged sized person.
Overall a great stay and definitely plan on booking again when returning to visit family in the future!"

The bunker couldn’t have been cuter, cleaner, or more prepped (filled with hygiene items, toiletries, kitchen supplies, spices, coffee, and snacks!).
The land was amazing which was so great for my dog who just has a small yard back home. Absolutely gorgeous. I reached out about having a time where their beautiful dog was inside so that I could go out with my girl (who tries to start trouble with other dogs) and Carolyn replied almost immediately and was super kind and accommodating by putting her dog inside so we could use the land without stress. I so appreciated it!
Shops, delis, and nature areas around the area were fun to explore and ended with lots of good food! I’m so grateful I decided to do this last minute trip. Thanks for having me, Carolyn and family!"

Carolyn and Jason were excellent host with a welcoming that will make you feel at home. I travel and stay away from home for extended periods of time. The Bunker House has been one of my best experiences and hated to leave. I highly recommend The Bunker House!

Extremely clean home, kind hosts, and the choice of toys from a basket helped out 4 kids be entertained along with the Roku tv. Lived the privacy of a master bed on the 1st floor, and the kids room being upstairs."

Miriam was responsive to our reservation and questions for local recommendations immediately. Check-in process and instructions were clear. And the house was exactly as described and cozy for a friends low-key weekend. And the homemade cookies that greeted us on the kitchen counter were AMAZING!"

We booked during the winter and it was quite warm and cozy. The host was very reliable and responsive to any questions we had. The kitchen was nice and had all the pots/pans/utensils we needed. There is a Dairy Queen within walking distance as well that made it easy for fast food.
I highly recommend Miriam!"

Group trip","We traveled for a two day sporting event, the home was the perfect quick 5 min get away to bounce back and forth. After being stuck in a gym for several hrs it was just like returning home. The home was decorated beautifully and was very clean. Plenty of space for all 6 of us to re-charge after a long day. Love the added touch of the welcome cookies. Would definitely rent again if in the area. Hosts are very responsive and nice."

Stayed with a pet","This house is beautiful and extremely comfortable. It isnt overly crowded and is beautifully decorated. It reallt just feels peaceful there. The porch swing and back porch patio are great places to hang out. There were amazing blueberry muffins waiting for us when we arrived and our fur babies really enjoyed the back yard! Aside from the home just being beautiful, its on a very quiet street and is easily accessible. Miriam was extremely responsive with me and was extremely kind. The biggest plus for me in this home is that the beds were EXTREMELY comfortable!!!! I am always shocked when i stay places because the beds are always hit or miss. My husband and I have back issues and this bed did not irritate our problems at all. I am so thankful for that! Any time I go back to Barnesville, I will be staying here. Thank you, Miriam!"

Stayed a few nights","We spent a nostalgic weekend in Barnesville. Our mother and grandmother grew up in this town and we spent many holidays and summers there. The cottage was perfect for our needs. The host left us fresh cookies, tomatoes and a green pepper. We were thrilled to find out we could buy Hall’s Herb Ham Salad at Riesbeck’s Market Deli. This was a childhood favorite of ours. The beds were very comfortable. The kitchen was stocked with everything you could need, including water bottles in the fridge. The cottage was nicely decorated. The neighborhood was quite and quaint. We will definitely stay here again on our return trips to Barnesville."
