Group trip","I brought my kids for the last hurrah before going back to school and we had a BLAST. France was very awesome and let us use paddle board and kayak. The pier was great for swimming and the water is awesome.
France, thanks for opening your home and allowing us some GREAT memories.

Stayed with kids","We had an amazing week on the lake! I stayed with my extended family of 8 adults, and 3 kids. We loved having large tables inside and out so the whole family could eat together. The kitchen was well equipped with everything we needed, including an extensive spice drawer.
All the furniture and beds were very comfortable and AC on the 2nd floor made it very easy to get a good night's sleep.
It was great having plenty of deck furniture and shady spots to relax with a view of the lake. We enjoyed using both the kayak and paddle board to explore the lake, so much easier than trying to rent from the marina. The water was perfect and super shallow with a sandy bottom--great for the kids to swim and play! There were also 2 drying racks for hanging swim suits and towels that came in very handy.
There are a LOT of stairs from the road to the house which made carrying luggage and groceries difficult. However, we were glad the house was down close to the lake. Hoping to be back in the future!"

The view of Fish Lake and all of the wild life is breathtaking.
Chris and Missy are the perfect hosts and are extremely friendly! We will definitely be back again!"

Fishing was good and we loved the kayaks. Beds are comfortable as well. After a long day in the sun, we loved sitting on the deck over the water and starting a fire. All in all we would definitely come back. On a side note outside of the property. Just know most restaurants are closed on Sunday-Tuesday, so be sure to pack food to cook. Chris was very kind, helpful, and quick to respond."

Stayed a few nights","This trip was very last minute so I was afraid we wouldn’t be able to find a place to stay at all, and then we found this gem! We had so much fun on the kayaks and on the big floaty by the dock. We had a few fires for s’mores and even got to see a beautiful summer storm. The house was clean, cozy, and had all the accommodations listed. Chris lives next door so he came by to introduce himself and bring over a new coffee pot since the old one was cracked during the previous renter’s stay. He was very communicative and overall really wonderful to work with! I hope we can rent this magical little lake house again in the future!"

Stayed a few nights","We named this the Fish Cottage as it is perfectly decorated with all things fish and was so bright and fun! This is a place to relax, enjoy the incredible views day or night, or go out on the water in kayaks. I normally like to unwind at the end of the day by watching TV, and there was a nice TV with firestick that didn’t get used! We didn’t want to burn any daylight or miss out on the cozy fire pit.
There are options for going out for meals but we didn’t want to miss out on staying at the cottage and either eating by the fire or on the back porch with tremendous views at either. We will be back!"

Stayed a few nights","We had a wonderful time at the cottage! Everything was just as described/pictured. It is a quiet, dead-end road/area of the lake. It was a nice area for walking or a run further along the lake past many cute cottages/homes. Our favorite spots were the deck and the screened-in porch, which was a great place for meals and games. We appreciated the kayaks, the inflatable, the deck chairs... all the amenities and lovely decorations. Communication with Chris was terrific. We had 4 adults - me, my husband and a grown son/his wife - and we wouldn't have wanted any more people as the cottage is cozy. The space works well, though, and had everything we needed. The beds were super comfortable. Ceiling fans and screened windows let us enjoy the cooler temperatures with fresh air day and night, but the air conditioner cooled things off in a hurry if needed. S'mores at the fire pit were also a highlight. Fish Lake has beautiful clear water and we enjoy the area. We would love to come and stay here again!"

The view off the deck overlooking clear and beautiful Fish Lake made for a couple days of fun, peaceful relaxation. Taking a morning paddle out on the kayaks was wonderful and the lake was quite warm overall in early July when we visited. Plenty of fun floating off the dock and there's a flat-top grill to use too! (now I want to get one!) Overall a great stay if you want to spend some close time with your friends or family."

Everything you need is already in the cottage. They thought of everything. If I didn’t have to be back to work I would have absolutely stayed one more night .
It’s cute, cozy and comfortable. Definitely one of my most favorite places I’ve ever stayed .
Tucked away from traffic and noise but there’s a store and a DG and a gas station about 7 minutes away . Can’t compliment this place enough . I’m already looking to go back very soon ."

When we told him we wouldn't arrive until after midnight, he made the pull-out bed, and left the lights on for us. Gorgeous scenery, quiet mornings and nights, and a perfect spot to either be in the sun or enjoy the breeze in the shade. This will be our go-to spot for future trips to visit family and friends."

Stayed a few nights","This is a great place for a quiet getaway. Located close enough to Chicago for a quick trip, but far enough away to get away from it all. The cottage is immaculately clean, comfy and well stocked. The host really did think of everything. The deck overlooking the lake is the perfect place to relax with a fire after spending the day in the water (inner tubes & kayaks). The home also has lake access with a pier (bring your boat?). The water off the pier is not deep and crystal clear, perfect for families with younger children. The location is tucked away so prepare for a short drive (15 - 20 minutes) for groceries etc. We totally relaxed and enjoyed ourselves and look forward to visiting again next year."

Enjoyed watching the boaters go by on the lake while sitting on comfy chairs on the deck (under the shade from the oak tree). Played games on the screened in porch. Porch to the deck was only steps away, everything very convenient. Cabin is updated and stylishly decorated. Chris let us know we could check in early and also let us know we could stay later than 11 due to the schedule that day, which we appreciated. We want to return soon. Thank you!"

Chris is a responsive, responsible host. The cottage was lovely with so many cute stylish touches. Beds comfortable. We had a lovely visit. We visited Plumb Lake County Park for some hiking and enjoyed checking out Shipshewana with its cute stores and Amish countryside. I would love to return."

Stayed a few nights","We had a great stay! The cottage is so cute and very comfortable. It’s decorated very nicely with lots of nice little touches that go together beautifully to create a fun, cheerful vibe. Chris and Missy were absolutely perfect hosts - they were available and friendly if we needed anything but gave us plenty of space and privacy. The weather was beautiful the day we arrived and Chris even set up an awesome inflatable raft in case we wanted to use it (it ended up being not quite warm enough but was such a thoughtful and generous thing to do and so appreciated)! The couch and beds were comfortable and we slept great. The cottage had everything we needed. There is no oven but there is a two-burner stovetop, a toaster oven, a microwave, and a grill, plus any utensils one could need, as well as a coffee maker and coffee. They seem to have thought of everything, with a little snack basket set out, information about nearby stores and restaurants, rafts, a bags set, books, and board games. The view is great, we spent most of our time on the deck which is right on the water, and the fall colors were lovely. The sunroom was also very cozy and a great place to eat, color, etc.,
Every aspect of our experience was great, and this place was very nicely and thoughtfully our together. I can definitely see is returning here for future relaxing getaways."

Stayed a few nights",Truly a hidden gem. Like literally. It’s easy to miss a turn so drive carefully and safely especially at night. Love that it’s remote and the lake is a few steps from the cabin! Gorgeous view. Warm and friendly hosts. Hoping to return. ❤️

Stayed a few nights","This is a fantastic find! Such a beautifully decorated place - the pictures do not do it justice! Tons of amenities including kayaks and an awesome propane griddle, puzzles and games, well supplied kitchen, snacks. The beds were so comfortable and sheets smelled nice. And of course the lake - clear and warm water, great deck overlooking the water. Wish I could have stayed longer! Very small place but set up perfectly to make use of the space."

Stayed with kids","Chris and Missy are amazing hosts! The cottage is a perfect getaway for a couple or a family of 4. They went above and beyond making us feel at home! We would definitely stay again! The cottage was very clean, which is extremely important to me. They left little snacks for us and had things for the family to do, such as games, kayaking, and a raft to float on. Chris and Missy were always available should we need anything. They were quick to respond and we enjoyed chatting with them in person too! It was perfect for our family!

The host is very attentive and quick to respond. The lake was great, sand bottoms and great to swim in. The kayaks for use made it extra special! We so enjoyed out stay and cannot wait to come back next year."

This comfortable cottage allows you to swim/kayak on the lake or lounge on the large shaded deck. Hosts have provided everything you’ll need for your stay. This place is great for a couples getaway as well as a family weekend with kids. Neighbors are very friendly & helpful with recommendations for area supplies. Most restaurants are a good 20 minutes away so bring some food with you or cook/grill your own here. We enjoyed our stay & wouldn’t hesitate to come back.

The only thing I need to let people know about is if it's hard for you or anyone in your group to do stairs you probably would want to find a different location. Other than that the place was wonderful with lovely added touches and surprises!

Stayed a few nights","I had the pleasure of staying for six weeks in The Upper Room apartment. I absolutely loved it and was sad to leave. I'll definitely return whenever I can.
The property is very easy to find and looked exactly as pictured. Here are some highlights:
- Streaming services on the tv were top notch.
- Fully equipped kitchen. There were even fancy snacks, and the coffee provided was delicious.
- In-unit laundry with laundry supplies (even laundry sanitizer).
- Ample cleaning supplies
- Spacious shower with very hot water (huge plus for me).
- Super friendly dogs that greeted me after work and were excited to play fetch.
Anthony and Lisa were very responsive and open to suggestions as well. They even brought me a Clorox toilet wand and dropped off extra toilet paper when it was needed, which was the icing on the cake for this experience. They were also flexible with me when I needed to shift my arrival or departure times.
Lastly, I loved the smell from the smoker in the backyard."

The apartment was also fully equipped with everything needed to feel like you are right at home. Since I was in town during winter months working on a construction project, I'd often return dusty from the job site. Having cleaning supplies on hand to be able to tidy up was a huge bonus.
I can't wait to come back to visit. I left feeling like I made new friends!"

After selling our home and quickly needing a place to feel like ""home"" during the transition into our new place, they were quick to respond and eager to help. Their place is easy to find and get in and out of. We had a private entrance and the space was absolutely perfect. The right size for my husband, son, and I to nestle in for a few weeks. I work remotely, so being comfortable where we go is really important to me and I love the sun streaming in the windows while i enjoy my coffee and get my work day going in the morning. Throwing a quick load of wash in mid-morning, and having little else to fuss over. Thanks again Anthony and Lisa... We appreciate you!"

It was very, very clean; very new; stylishly decorated and had everything we needed for a one night's stay while visiting Shipshewana and the RoundBarn Theater in Nappanee (with the new owners, it's definitely worth the trip!). The authentic Italian restaurant in Howe was a great find, and close, too.
The bed/mattress was terrific, super soft sheets, great pillows (I'm extremely picky on this, but was very pleased!) and curtains that helped darken the space for a great night's sleep.
We would definitely recommend this place -- great value and so much better than a hotel -- and would stay here again. Well done!"

Stayed with kids","My two children and I stayed at Scott and Becky’s trailer and it was more wonderful than I could have imagined. We received a warm welcome and was walked through everything we had access to. The lake is breathtaking and the beach area was so clean and lovely with so many different activities. And it’s only steps away from the trailer! The kayaks and paddle boards were very nice and easily accessible. Slides, toys and floating docks. We were even able to use the smaller fishing boat to explore on our own. I have never driven a boat before but Scott helped and make it clear for me so I felt comfortable. It was such a wonderful trip and every single one of my questions/needs/requests were answered immediately. I would 100% recommend and urge anyone (especially families with kids) to stay here. I promise you will be overjoyed by the experience. It was above and beyond anything I could have expected! Scott and his immediate family and grandchildren were so much fun and we will be back!"

Stayed a few nights","I’m making this review in case there’s anyone like me thinking of renting this place out. It was clean and very pretty aesthetically. Although, if you’re looking for a nice private getaway with your significant other, I think you should pass this one by. Becky was very aware of us wanting privacy and was extremely friendly. Scott was someone with good intentions but seemed to have a hard time discerning what a respectable time was, to interact with guests. With the camper being decently close to their house he would come to it several times a day and talk to us. They can very easily see you and what you’re doing from their house. He came and knocked on the door the first night, later in the evening and a lot of the other different interactions felt intrusive. With all that being said, we decided with the lack of privacy and not feeling like we were having a very restful weekend, we left the night before we needed to. To go home and try to rejuvenate from all the different interactions."

It is a gem where you can do a campfire while looking at the lake. The camper/RV was convenient with all the heating, shower, and kitchen. When I had a reservation, I only camped when I had a reservation, and it seemed like there was a little bit of a spoken part. (Whether it was a melting shauer, an electronic blanket, etc.), and the owner's (dong) Mme (sheep) (sheep) people (dong) (Mme (sheep) () people who don't think it was short, so I felt a little more.

Stayed with kids","This place was absolutely great! It is a small camper but our family of four fit well. Scott was quick to respond to any questions we had or things we personally forgot to bring with, he was quick to help us! The kids loved the game garage and my fiancé and I had a great time fishing each night. Although we had a storm knock the power out while there, Scott brought us some candles and lanterns so we could enjoy our board games. Our kids are far apart in age (13&5) and they both had a blast! Thank you for everything! This quiet camper was exactly what this “go go family” needed before the school year begins."

Stayed with kids","We had a wonderful stay at Scott's place, it was just what we needed to end our summer! I have three boys ages 12, 13, and 7 and there were many things for them all to do. It was like being at a summer camp, but on a quiet and peaceful lake that is surrounded by many beautiful farms! On our short stay we fished, kayaked, paddle boarded, swung, swam, slide off the new slide on the beach, trampolined, used the floats, played ladder ball, carpet ball (a fun new game introduced to us), ping pong, and spent quality time relaxing around the fire at night. Scott even let my youngest ride around on his electric John Deer riding toy. Scott provided unlimited firewood for us which was much appreciated. However the highlight of the trip was for sure going out on Scott's one of a kind pontoon boat! This is a must in the warmer months! My boys had so much fun jumping off the platforms, and Scott was so kind to let them take turns driving the boat and even took awesome pictures for us. We also received a beautiful tour of the lake and learned some of the history. The camper was very clean, and although a little tight with 5, with an extra mattress provided, it worked well for our family! There were lots of nice extra touches like coffee and some snacks and water, soap, shampoo and conditioner, and a book with all kinds of information about the area. I am sure the area is absolutely beautiful in the fall too. Scott and his family (especially his sweet and adorable grandkids we got the pleasure of meeting) are warm and wonderful people and you will leave feeling like you made new friends. The value for what you get at Scott's place is unbeatable! My boys asked if we could come back every year. I am sure you will love Scott's place as much as we did. Don't hesitate to book!"

I utilized the kayaks for both a sunset ride and again in the morning. I went on this trip solo and felt super safe on the property. My only regret is not staying more than one night! I will definitely visit again."

Stayed with kids","My husband, 1 year old daughter and I stayed at Scott's Lake Life camper for a 2 night weekend getaway while in town visiting family. We absolutely LOVED it! The host was beyond attentive and hospitable. He was extremely quick with responding to messages or any issue we had. He made sure we had anything and everything we needed our entire stay! The camper was so nice and roomy! Even with our pack and play up at night we had plenty of room to move around! The bed and sofa were super comfortable as well! Overall, we had an amazing time despite not spending much of our days there. The scenery is absolutely beautiful. Our first morning there was pretty chilly so we played carpet ball in the garage just feet from the camper. Such a fun game! Our last morning was beautiful and warm so we enjoyed the relaxing water and fisherman. Wifi is provided on the deck of the hosts home, but at the camper we had no wifi or phone signal and we really enjoyed that! It was great to unplug for a few days! Definitely intend to make it our go to spot when visiting family and are already planning our next stay, hopefully this summer! 10/10 would reccomend!"

Stayed with kids","Our family of four (two little ones) had a blast at Lake Life! The pristine lake is mere steps from the RV, with a campfire ring and an awesome dock just in front. A perfect beach is adjacent, with inviting sand and a super handy launch pad/dock (I made up this term) for the kayaks and paddle board (I've never gotten in and out of kayaks so easily). The RV is comfortable, clean, and complete with all the camping amenities you could want (even coffee filters, wine bottle opener, can opener, a night light, etc etc etc). Is it the Ritz? No, but it is truly perfect. I brought our own blankets, but didn't even bring them out of our car, as the linens and comforters provided were clean, fresh and warm. My kids enjoyed everything about this slice of heaven: the beach, the kayak rides, the unique swings, the giant trampoline, the animals on the neighboring farms, the roaring campfires, the bike trailers, and they even got a such a kick out of sleeping on the full size sofa bed. We did not use the pontoon or other boat on this trip, but did have a great hike in the neighboring trails, and were so taken by the entire experience. We will definitely be back!"

- Several kayaks and paddle boats. They also had couple of others boats.
- kids have options galore to enjoy there time. From trampoline to slides and swings. Scott, the owner of the property was gracious enough to offer bikes and stroller for local exploration.
- Full marks to Scott to keep the guests engaged. He was always available for any help. Took us on fun ride on his pontoon boat shared some interesting tit bits on some local fun options. When we showed some interest in hiking option, Scott and his wife picked up a map for us while on their evening walk. That was a touching jesture. We enjoyed the hiking route that Scott suggested.
All and all a great place. Too bad we only stayed for a day. We will surely revisit next season."

The lake is beautiful and quiet with lots of wildlife; swans, cranes, hawks, fish and other little woodland critters all make an appearance. We used the kayaks and paddle boards and had a blast exploring the lake. We stayed two nights, one of which was rainy, but we had a great time, making a camp fire the first evening. Our host even offered extra time after scheduled checkout to enjoy the lake since one of our two days was rainy. He and his wife were extremely welcoming and available for questions. The country roads are also great for long distance rides; there are quite a few small towns and lakes that can be explored on bike. We had a great time and will be back."

Stayed with kids","Scott was a great host. We enjoyed all that his place had to offer (especially for the kids)

Scott took us on a boat ride around lake. While not a big lake, it was perfect as it was not crowded like other lakes during summer. A funny incident where the pontoon ran out of gas about 100 yards to the shore and Scott was ready to jump into the water, swim to the shore and get some gas. He made one last attempt to tilt the gas tank and the boat got enough gas to get us to shore. It was a lot of fun.
We will be back next year!!"

Using the kayaks at will to enjoy the clear cool water any time I wanted so such a bonus. The natural wildlife in the early morning or later day so beautiful to watch. Fish, birds, frogs, lily pads, etc. Trying SUP for the first time with the Hosts encouragement so cool! The water, oh, so clear and fresh just wonderful. As a female solo traveler I liked having the Hosts nearby and the residential feel of other adults/children along the lake doing their thing made it homey. The camper is cozy and just right for getting rested, cleaned up and out again for more fresh air and beautiful lake life nature adventures. It was also perfect for a late afternoon book reading/nap sesh. I have told several friends to look up this listing and I hope to return myself. Thank you Scott and Becky"

I had my qualms about staying in a camper, especially with two kiddos, but I shouldn't have worried. The camper was just the right size for a family of four and was clean, comfortable, and cozy. Scott and his wife have thought of everything and are great hosts. They went above and beyond even providing local coffee & a basket of snacks. The camper is surrounded by beauty (tons of wildflowers in bloom and a gorgeous lake right in front of your door.) They offer FREE!!! use of the kayaks and paddleboards on site and was so kind to give us a ride on the pontoon, even letting our daughters take turns ""driving"" the boat. Our stay has been the highlight of our summer road trip and we are already talking about returning again on our next visit to Shipshewana.
PROS: easy communication and quick responses, beautiful location central to lots of bigger cities, use of kayaks & paddleboards, swing set, trampoline, beach, garage with games inside, comfortable bed
CONS: None!"

The location is beautiful and quiet, and Scott was more than helpful in giving us access to the waterfront and making sure we got a cozy fire in the evening. He also had great tips on what to do in the area while we were there and let us join him for church on Sunday. We’ll definitely be staying again in the summer!"

The Millers did everything they could to help us enjoy the place, including getting us out on the lake in their Kayaks. This is a great place to stop on way east or west."

Camper was cozy with the five of us in there, but not too small, and the rural area was a nice reprieve from the busyness of city life. The hosts are fantastic, very kind and caring people. Would definitely recommend this place!"

Stayed with kids","Staying at this lakefront Airbnb was an amazing experience that far exceeded what we were expecting. Jeff really took care of us, making sure we had plenty of towels and bedding to make our stay super comfortable. The place was spotless when we arrived, and being right by the lake added such a nice touch to our trip.
One thing that stood out was the farm-fresh eggs they left for us. It was such a thoughtful gesture and made us feel really welcome.
The house itself had everything we needed, from a well-equipped kitchen to cozy furniture. Waking up to the view of the lake each morning was just breathtaking.
Overall, we were blown away by how great this Airbnb was. It was the perfect mix of comfort, cleanliness, and natural beauty. We would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing getaway."

Stayed with kids","It’s a beautiful property. A lake house in MI in March is not the ideal choice for many families. Our family members were coming from 3 different states so the cousins & siblings could spend some time together. The older they get the harder it is to make that happen. Having time to play games, laugh together & make some memories was our goal and we were not disappointed. Jeff was great to work with, very helpful & friendly. Being on the lake with a dock, kayak, and lots of water paraphernalia would make it a fantastic summer vacation spot but we thoroughly enjoyed our less hectic stay in early spring."

Stayed with kids","Jeff's cottage on Klinger Lake is truly a spectacular AirBnB. It's spacious, comfortable, well appointed, super clean (and does NOT reek of air freshener the way some AirBnBs do which is a HUGE PLUS!!!!), and has plenty of bedrooms and lounging space so that the whole family can feel comfortable. We rented over the Thanksgiving holiday and could not have been happier. The kitchen is extremely well stocked with pots, pans, utensils, etc. This location cannot be beat -- in the summer you'll be able to walk to Blind Island Brewery and the Marina. There's ample parking, and a fantastic outdoor porch and screened porch. Jeff was communicative, kind, and helpful. I would 100% recommend this cottage to anyone and everyone!"

we loved the small notes blended into the environment so that just when we had a question, there would be one or more notes artistically blended into the area answering our questions ... kind of like our personal FAQ list.
the property is located in an immaculately landscaped garden-like, perfectly mown lawn. We watched a black squirrel stroll through and listened to birds chirping in the tall trees on the property - the effect was meditative and relaxing. We will return ... thanks Ross and Jennifer"

But the only running water is the bathroom (as listed) so no cooking or really washing of dishes. The bed was comfy but also a little squeaky if you are sensitive to noise, nothing too out of the ordinary. Also give the water in the shower plenty of time to adjust, it can get super hot and adjustments can change the temp drastically.
So grateful for this place of refuge in my hometown where I am now a visitor the past 20 years ♥️"

Stayed one night","This is a beautiful apartment in a quiet, safe residential neighborhood. We give it an enthusiastic 4 stars (where 4 stars is our highest rating). It was nice to have separate rooms for sleeping (in a very comfortable bed) and for hanging out (on comfy furniture) -- and all the rooms, including the bathroom, were nicely furnished and decorated. It was a very calming environment, especially appreciated after our long drive from Ontario. We stayed only one night and wished we could have stayed longer. Especially appreciated the hard copy instructions for making coffee (with two options -- a drip coffeemaker and a French press) -- it took the guesswork out of making a good cup of joe in the morning! Highly recommend!"

I loved the sitting room area - I dislike hotels where the only option is to sit on the bed to read or watch tv. Directions and check-in were spot on. There was more than I needed for a one night stay - mini-fridge, microwave and snacks. These are definitely the hosts with the most. I plan on staying here on my next visit."

Stayed one night","This was the perfect stopover location for our road trip out to Chicago. Easy-to-find, incredibly safe/quiet, and featured all of the little details that go above and beyond what we expected. We didn't get to explore the town at all, but we'll make it back someday and look forward to hopefully staying again!"

The space felt like it was lovingly made for close family members, not strangers passing through. I took a walk through the safe neighborhood with a smile on my face.
I wish I could have stayed longer to enjoy it more!"

Stayed a few nights","This was exactly the quiet retreat that I had hoped for. A bonus for me was that it was only 1 mile to Thurston Woods Village where my elderly mom now lives. I enjoyed the less than 20 min walk there to visit her, through a nice neighborhood with well-kept homes and tree-lined streets. Holly and I met by chance as I returned home one night and she was such a pleasant and kind person. The bed was great, very comfortable and everything was very clean. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend Holly’s place. It is exactly as represented in the photos. The bathroom is across the hall, but I had complete privacy during my stay."

Comfortable and clean accommodations in a quiet location on the edge of town.
The town of Sturgis itself is larger than we anticipated and the downtown looks very interesting and inviting, although we arrived too late in the day to investigate.
Would highly recommend Holly's place as you travel through this area."

The door to the outside had a screen door but we couldn’t get it to open no matter how many times we turned the lock in either direction. My husband and I both found the bed ( a Murphy style) very uncomfortable and hardly slept. There was a lot of extra clean linens in the closet. It’s important to note there is no Tv in the room. Overall it worked fine for what we needed.

Stayed with kids",Overall it wasn't awful but.. my husband was the first one to arrive as I had to work late. When he arrived the front door was wide open and propped open with the nutcracker by the door and the music was really loud. There was left over food in the fridge and the shower was full of hair and clogged. I contacted Sam to make sure someone wasn't still checked in or something and he advised he was just at the home at 1pm and checked everything so that was strange to us. He did offer to come relook at things which we appreciated. Other than that things weren't awful it just wasn't really our vibe. The place was quite dusty and not the cleanest. There are also personal family pictures hanging up on the wall which just was not really our vibe.

Stayed a few nights","Wow! Beautiful home-hard to believe it was better than the pictures-it was! We stayed here as we had a wedding at Twin Gables. It was a 15 minute drive to the venue and it was a great place to stay.
Loved morning coffee on the deck overlooking the water, and then followed that up kayaking with the kayaks in the garage.
We really enjoyed the individual temperature controls in each room. Everyone loved how comfortable the beds were. The kitchen had plenty of cooking supplies.
Host was very responsive when texting/calling and was helpful.
Downside: Reading the departure rules was overwhelming when we had a tight schedule. We always try to leave a BNB as tidy as when we arrive, but to read we had to strip beds and start to wash our linens/towels was not something we typically have to do at a BNB-especially when paying a cleaning fee. However, we happily did so.
We would delightfully stay here again!"

Stayed with kids",We loved our stay - wish the weather was a little warmer but that’s not in anyone’s control. The lake view was peaceful and we were able to enjoy the deck on a warmer afternoon. The best part was the beds; the beds felt like home! It was so nice to finally stay at a place that invested in their mattresses. We find that many places are great but after a long day you want to lay down and get a restful nights sleep and the beds seem to lack but not here! We would definitely rent from them again - all of your basic essentials were there and the finishes just made you feel right at home! Thanks for the great mini vacation!

Great place for the winter, Swiss Valley Ski Resort only being 35 minutes away! and looks like a great place to be in the summer with the nice open deck out the back door over looking the water."

Highly recommend for your stay. It was off season and a cool weekend when we stayed but extremely quiet and loved the views.
