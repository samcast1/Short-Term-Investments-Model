It was a peaceful morning with coffee and a little bass fishing. Will be coming back if in the area or needing a place around Windstar casino.

Stayed a few nights","Absolutely perfect place for our group of 5 ladies. We were in the area to celebrate my daughter's birthday, attend a concert at Winstar Casino and enjoy a quiet weekend. This house was adorable, very comfortable, quiet and close to everything we wanted/needed. We only had 1 negative, missed having Granny's Breakfast casserole. I found out later from Jeffrey, that amenity was stopped after Covid. We were looking forward to it, but had a wonderful breakfast at a recommended place on the square in the downtown Gainesville area! We all agreed that Jeffrey's place was GREAT and highly recommend staying here."

There are enough dishes and equipment to comfortably cook, the cupboards have basic staples well-arranged and easy to find, and the host provided a nice array of snacks, etc. which made our arrival even better (my teenagers approved!).
We found it a relaxing place to come back to after a day of visiting with relatives in the area. The patio is a lovely, calm space for a cup of tea or evening beverage. The neighborhood is nice, quiet and my daughter and I felt comfortable walking down to the nearby grocery store."

Stayed with kids","This place was all we were needing and more. The neighborhood is quiet and felt very safe. The yard is gorgeous. The house says it can hold 8 guests and truly can. So many times a number like that means someone is sleeping on the floor on a mat and half of the people are standing up to eat. Not so in Jeffrey’s home. He thought of everything and had amenities stocked we never knew how much we would appreciate, even a cabinet filled with dishes specifically geared towards kids. And books. So many books. Which our family loves. We’d definitely stay at Jeffrey’s place if we end up in the area again."

We needed lodging and a place to meet each evening after a weekend horsemanship clinic and found this to be a perfect choice. Beautifully decorated, quality furnishings and appointments and a truly home-away-from-home feel.
We thoroughly enjoyed the time we spent before and after our horse clinic each day. Lovely; so much better than having separate rooms at a hotel.
P.S. That morning casserole was a huge hit with our riders!"

He has thought of everything a guest might need . . . from the well-stocked kitchen including water, juices, soft drinks and snacks to the well-stocked bathrooms with an abundance of toiletries and towels.

Stayed with kids","I had a golf event at the Winstar casino which is about 10-15 minutes from this house. It ended up not only being the perfect location, but an exceptional rental as well.
The house, which is in a quiet neighborhood, has every amenity you would need for a short or long stay. Large open kitchen was FULLY stocked with everything needed. Fridge had everything needed to cook and some. The home is very well furnished with comfortable and stylish furniture. Wi-fi is fast. Huge backyard that my kids played in for hours. AC was ice cold. Water was hot instantly. Wide driveway that parks you right at the front door under a carport that provides privacy.
The host was easy to contact and provided us all the info needed for an easy check in.
I highly recommend this house especially for families and groups of people looking for convenience and quiet."

Jeff is very quick with his responses to anything that you might need while staying in the home. We will always stay with Jeff anytime we are traveling north up around the border, he made sure our stay was great, and having this place to stay at over any hotels in the area was a nice treat, we definitely recommend this home to anyone, very affordable price and very, very clean home!

Stayed a few nights","I don't know if all Airbnb hosts go to the lengths that Jeffery does as this was our first Airbnb experience. He has certainly set the bar very high!
I was somewhat trepidatious as I was traveling with my elderly Mom who has some physical limitations and meeting my brother and his wife who has some severe allergies. Jeffery's prompt responses to my questions put my mind at ease.
And once we arrived, WOW! His home is immaculate, more spacious than it appears in the profile photos and is flawlessly appointed with every need anticipated. From the selection of breakfast items (including Grandma's breakfast casserole) and the stocked refrigerator in the kitchen to the ceiling fans AND floor fans in every bedroom, Jeffery has thought of everything. He even had great dining recommendations for our family.
We had a relaxing, easy time enjoying each other's company and the comforts of home away from home. We are already talking about scheduling our next trip to Melody Lane."

The house was perfect for this, especially with one bedroom having double beds for the kids. We also loved the outdoor space, and the school playground directly behind the house was a nice bonus.
The house was nicely decorated without being overdone, and the kitchen is very welcoming with an island with bar stools (we spent a lot of time just hanging out in the kitchen).
Everything we needed was provided in the house, including many coffee choices, water and juice in the fridge, fruit, and homemade breakfast casseroles in the freezer ready to pop into the oven.
I travel to Gainesville quite often and would definitely stay here again."

From the moment we walked in the door, we knew we had made the correct choice in staying with Jeffrey. The house had a fresh smell which was huge for my wife and we were blown away by the decor and work that had been done in the home. There literally was nothing not considered. From breakfast ready in the frig for two days to it also being stocked with water and juice. Snacks and several different coffees were available. Everything you could possibly need was stocked in the kitchen and bathrooms. The house is very clean, great layout and cozy. We enjoyed our stay and will without question stay here again. This is probably the best overnight spot in Gainesville, especially for the value. We all highly recommend Jeffrey's and promise you won't be disappointed."

Stayed one night","There was a train horn all night long and an outside light shined in a bedroom window all night. Curtails could not be adjusted to block it out which made sleeping difficult. Description said “currently” decorated for Christmas. Didn’t realize it was permanently that way. There were so many decorations it made the home feel cluttered. Only one TV in the house. It was in a bedroom and positioned where only one person could see it. Bathrooms only had one towel in each. Two of the three bathrooms did not have toiletries, only hand soap. The paint was peeling off the ceiling and walls. It was clear maintenance is needed. The ice maker was frozen to the fridge and not producing ice. Dining room table was covered with items for sale from the “store”. Drawers and closets were full so very limited space to unpack our stuff. While we understand it is a Victorian style home, furniture was not comfortable for relaxing or social gathering. One positive was all the beds were comfortable and clean."

Stayed one night","We greatly enjoyed our stay at Livier’s historic home, which is as much a museum as a an air b and b. Lots of lovely antique items to admire, but the home is updated enough to include modern comforts. Livier had impeccable communication and the house was ready for us much earlier than we could get there. We had no issues during our stay except that it should be noted that the house is very close to busy train tracks. Might be worth throwing in some foam ear plugs to help dampen overnight train horns and whistles. Overall, this was a unique, convenient, and affordable place for my adult family members to stay while in town for a concert at the Winstar. Because of all the lovely and fragile items on display, I would not recommend this location for families with young children. It is a more formal space. We would definitely stay here again if we returned to the area."

The whole house is gorgeous. The Airbnb was tucked away in a residential private area which my family and friends enjoyed. The house is full of historical unique well preserved things. It felt like we were stepping back in time but still offering us all the amenities that we needed for comfortable stay. The host is friendly and responsive as well. Our experience exceeded our expectations. The place is spacious, cozy and comfortable. We will definitely book at the same place again the next time when we go there for vacation. Highly recommended to anyone."

We were really impressed with the host and all the amenities she left for us. We didn’t walk to the lake but it looked very pretty. The animal life around the area will come visit and that makes it more fun.
I absolutely recommend this rental."

There was water in the fridge and some snacks on the counter when we arrived. The backyard is adorable. Walking distance to several restaurants and shops (about two blocks). Quiet neighbors. You can hear a train in the distance but it’s nothing that keeps you up or is disruptive. There is room for two cars in the driveway and there is also street parking right out front. Really easy to get to—about an hour drive from DFW without traffic. Would stay here again if I’m in Gainesville.

Stayed with kids","Great place to stay while in town for a wedding. The layout was perfect for our family! My brother's family with 2 kids slept in the first two rooms, my parents in the master, and myself (a single) in the back room. There is definitely room to throw a air mattress down in the living room if needed. We had additional family come and visit during the day and it was big enough that everyone could relax comfortably. The place is larger then the pictures imply. The home was very clean and had all the things that we needed (and forgot - i.e. a blow dryer) The washer and dryer was a nice touch and utilized for someone who didn't have time to wash a few clothes before the trip. The location was perfect as well, we walked to a restaurant a couple blocks away for dinner one night. It was also close to the highway, as well as the zoo which we also visited. We feel very fortunate to have found this place and would book again in a heart beat if ever in the area again."

Definitely an unforgettable experience. We hope to come back soon!!!"

Stayed a few nights","Looks just like the photos. We had some crazy storms roll through overnight and they offered us guest bedroom in another Airbnb for the night so we were safe. I will say, this dome is not sealed well so expect an extra amount of bugs. The amount of gnats all over the dome, bedding, and kitchen made our skin crawl. Not sure if they were in excess due to all the rain we have been getting but it was rough.
Hot tub and outdoor shower were great and very relaxing. I expecting the outdoors areas to be a little more put together. The dome was stocked with most the things we needed."

The place was well-thought out from the design to the nice finishes and to the layout of the dome and the area around it. We walked the trails behind the dome and also enjoyed the hot tub. Charles and Laurie were very responsive and thoughtful -- while there wasn't thunderstorms like it was forecasted during our stay, they easily reassured us of a comfortable stay and even the light rain made it a much more relaxing stay. Definitely will come back!"

Our favorite was taking the walk on the trail, there were flashlights, and plus a map provided. We definitely experienced exactly what we needed and expected from this trip.
P.S The outside shower seemed skeptical at first but it was in fact very private, WARM WATER and honestly therapeutic! during my shower a squirrel ran the tree. Hahah.

Stayed one night","I made it a goal to stay in as many unique airbnbs as possible this year and let me tell you, this one is right at the top of my favorites. First off the pictures don’t do it justice. It was almost so beautifully done that I didn’t even want to put my stuff down and ruin the aesthetic! The dome itself is so incredibly unique but yet so homey feeling. At night when all was quiet, you could hear and see every leaf hit the dome, it was this incredibly serene sound almost like asmr. It was nature in surround sound! The amenities were flawless. The hot tub is always my favorite but I fell in love with the outdoor shower and decided my next home will have one. The water’s so hot that it didn’t even matter the exterior temp. Looking up at the lights and stars while you shower was just such an unexpected joy. The dome is tucked away off a quiet country road and private however there’s a six minute drive into a cute little town for great food. 10/10 stars for this immersive nature experience!"

We came to unwind from all the Thanksgiving holiday festivities, and it was the perfect place to relax, decompress, and feel like we were in an elegant, classy home-away-from-home in the midst of a peaceful, beautiful landscape! All the essentials are provided, and it is the perfect place to go ""glamping"" while still feeling like you're staying in a 5-star hotel. The outdoor shower is the perfect touch, and although we stayed here in late fall, we never felt too cold to enjoy the outdoor amenities, including the firepit and hot tub!
Charles and Laurie were in contact with us throughout our stay, and they were proactive in ensuring we had all the information we needed to make our stay comfortable and magnificent! Thank you for building such an amazing get-away on the outskirts of the DFW Metroplex maze! It was an absolutely wonderful experience, and we can't wait to do it again next year!

Charles and Laurie went out of their way to make it special for us and arriving to jazz, sparkling, a sweet note, and rose petals was the perfect touch to set the tone for the entire stay. The place is immaculate and rejuvenating. Nothing beats waking up under the natural light of the sun through the canopy of trees over the dome; it’s incredibly soothing and a great way to start a day. Whether you like hikes, reading (or napping) in the hammock, soaking in the hot tub, or curling up inside with a puzzle, there is something for every mood. This hidden gem will be a true favorite of ours for years to come."

Outdoor shower a brilliant feature, in natural daylight or under the lights at night, for enlivening one's inner bohemian. Although you are aware you're part of a rural neighborhood, it is still able to be a private sanctuary. While all in one space, the bedroom, dining, kitchen, bathroom, and sitting areas are arranged to feel like each their own space apart from the others. Along with the outdoor shower, hot tub, seating/fire pit/grill area, play area, and walking paths in the woods, we felt no need to ""go"" anywhere else for four days. We did use our tokens for ice cream at the family soda shop in Whitesboro when we checked out on the last day!

Stayed a few nights","Sky Dome holds some of the greatest memories we’ve made- just a breathtaking experience! Our honeymoon was here & we booked it again exactly one year later because it’s just that amazing. Charles & Laurie have thought of every little comfort & even provide special luxury touches to make you feel like you’re at an exclusive exotic resort. My wife is an avid Airbnb user and she says the sky dome is in her top 5 stays of all time. I loved the mood lighting, hot tub, outdoor shower, walking path in the trees & mister system for swinging in the hammock. We enjoyed Lovejoys (the restaurant/shop in town owned by the hosts parents) and appreciated the tokens for free ice cream that were left for us in the welcome display upon our arrival. The Sky Dome is private, secluded and quiet. It’s the perfect setting for a peaceful romantic getaway. If you are considering booking DO IT NOW! I also suggest booking a minimum of two nights to be able to really soak it all in. You’ll be glad you did!"

The Sky dome was clean and had all the essentials for cooking. I honestly have nothing even slightly negative to say, they thought of everything. It’s the perfect trip for a couple. We also ventured into town, which was amazing! I love the buildings in an old town. We stopped at Love Joys for ice cream. The owner, or who I think is the owner of Love joys, came out to talk to us. She is a beautiful, kind, caring, and compassionate woman. She made a large impression on us during our stay. We will remember this trip for a lifetime. Thank you Laurie and Charles for creating a safe and relaxing getaway! It was perfect!"

Charles and Laurie were both very kind as is the entire family and their parent’s restaurant in the local town. Instructions were everywhere that covered anything and everything you would need to know. I travel extensively for work and this was by far the cleanest, most beautiful place I have ever been in. It was a delightfully refreshing trip. So many friends and family have asked about our beautiful photos and we have already been recommending this stay! Walk around the backwoods to discover areas and trails that are more than peaceful with beautiful picture worthy pieces of nature. We will definitely be back and try to make it around the fall-winter! Thank you!"

I definitely plan to be back as soon as I can. This is my new go-to for a peaceful, close-enough getaway. The hosts were so sweet and the communication was great.

We’ve been there only one night (my husband’s birthday) but it feels like we had a good long vacation. On the way back to Dallas we stopped in Pilot Point (very authentic place).
BTW Charles and Laurie prepared a little surprise for my husband’s birthday even better than I asked

The location is the type of place you come and stay and don't plan on going out. Just nest in and enjoy the time together with no responsibilities.

As homeschooling parents of four, My wife and I needed a night away and this hit the spot. It rained, even thunder stormed, during a large chunk of the night, but it actually added to the ambiance. The pitter-patter on the dome was relaxing.
The only things I would note: Bring slippers, and note the toilet has little privacy (behind a wall but of course still in the open of the dome) although most couples probably wouldn’t even think much of it."

Beautifully decorated with detailed instructions that left nothing unanswered. From the music drifting down from the sky canopy upon arrival, to the beautiful welcome basket, note and fire pit perfectly set up; the details have not been missed at this property.
The play of light and wind on the canopy and the beauty of waking up with a view of the trees makes this place magical.
The outdoor shower worked perfectly, and the evenings unwinding in the hot tub under the stars added to the charm and uniqueness of this location.
Extremely comfortable bedding and furnishings with all the right touches of luxury, made this truly feel like a 5 star hotel experience.
We look forward to the next time we need to sneak away and recharge."

Stayed one night","Charles and Laurie are amazing host. Incredibly responsive communication, extremely detailed, proactive….they make your stay very convenient and effortless. The place has everything you would need, private surroundings, items designated in appropriate locations, clean and very well thought-out to make your stay comfortable. For example, upon arrival we wanted to spend time outside by the fire using the BBQ for dinner and making s’mores….well, the fire pit was completely set up for us….the only thing we needed to do was light the paper. The place is definitely worth a 5-star rating due to the experience you receive from the host and the complete facility on location. Beautiful place!!!"

Stayed one night","We could hear the Christmas music as we walked up the steps to the dome. To our surprise, there was a lovely note and welcome gift (we were celebrating husband's birthday), Christmas decorations and essential oils being defused. We honestly felt so welcomed! Such a perfect way to step away from all the responsibilities of life and stay someone that feels out of this world.
We loved the outdoor, indoor feel. The outside shower is GORGEOUS and everything is so well done. We used the grill to make dinner and had such a relaxing time.
If you are a light sleeper. bring a sound machine or play white noise from your phone. My husband got woken up by a donkey! So funny. Didn't bother us at all, but you are in the country. Know that this is a dome and the bathroom is sectioned off, it's not a separate room.
There are a couple other residences on the property, but you are completely secluded in your area. Loved the privacy and the quiet. And, yeah, this place was beyond cool. We will be back!"

Stayed a few nights","I can’t begin to describe how perfect the SkyDome was! This stay was exactly what my husband and I were looking for to celebrate our first wedding anniversary. The space was even better in person than the listing shows (if that’s possible)! Our jaws dropped when we walked in! It was secluded and peaceful. Charles and Laurie were great hosts - very responsive and friendly. The space was so thoughtful in how it was presented and decorated, they thought of everything! The bnb had everything we needed for our two night stay. The AC units inside allowed the space to become as warm or cool as you needed and the bed was so cozy with plenty of extra blankets provided, perfect for a cold Texas night. The fire pit, grill, and outdoor seating were perfect. The outdoor shower and hot tub made the space. It was so romantic, we felt like we landed in a 5 star resort in the woods. If you’re thinking about staying here, don’t waste another second - book this space right now! We can’t wait to return."

There's trails to hike, amazing sun rise to view from the dome window and the outdoor shower is a must try even in the cold weather. This place is solid and sturdy! There were 20mph winds outside one night and the dome didnt move even the slightest. You def feel well protected from outdoor elements. if you're looking to get away for a week or weekend check this place out for some much enjoyed R&R"

We could use the outdoor shower and still feel clean, as well as have so many provided amenities like the kitchen tools, coffee and the amazing personal touches when we were celebrating our wedding anniversary!

The lights were a bit complex but the owners had left all of the necessary controls near the lights so it was easy to figure the variety of switches and remote controls out. The kitchen was wonderful with very high quality appliances and just enough cookware and dishes for what ever meals were planned. I would highly recommend it to others.

Stayed a few nights","Y’ALL. This caboose was kind of a dream airbnb for me. If you’re looking for a peaceful getaway, this is it - you will not be disappointed. I read reviews and looked at photos, but all of it was so so much better in person.
I loved drinking my morning coffee on the patio, just watching the horse and goats graze while the wind whipped through the trees and clover. At night I sat out under the string lights and listened to the toads in the pond. I could have happily sat there for hours. As a solo traveler it was a perfect reset for my brain. Work and life can be so stressful but to just sit and listen to nature in such a beautiful setting was everything I needed.
It is well stocked and had even more than I anticipated. They made such good use of the space and it feels so much bigger than it is. You can tell so much love and care was put into the caboose and into making folks feel comfortable and at home.
I can’t wait to come back!"

It is the perfect amount of space for 2 people, was beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean. We both worked from the caboose during the week and had no problems with the wifi. A huge bonus was the outdoor space and we really enjoyed watching the horse and goats roam around the field.

Dave the Horse was our friendly morning visitor which we loved. Our last night there was privy to a series of really bad Thunderstorms, but the caboose was solid protection. Not sure if we'll ever be back to that area of Texas, but if we do, we'd definitely look them up and stay again. This place is perfect for a couples getaway. Thanks guys for making our anniversary trip a win! *****"

I would HIGHLY recommend coming to stay at the caboose! It is a beautifully unique stay! They knew what they were doing with the attention to detail! I liked that they had a wall in heater, that they included a crossing light to the caboose as a porch light that could actually be controlled by a switch. Definitely loved waking in up in the morning and listening to the birds chirp, and looking outside my window to see a beautiful white horse walk around. It was a very relaxing, and peaceful trip.

Stayed a few nights","I'm a handywoman and I also own a janitorial company so when I walk into an Airbnb, I have high expectations of things working properly, the finish out on a home, and cleanliness. Let's start from the beginning. The communication was the best I've had from any Airbnb host. The directions to get to the home, the gate access, how to enter the home were perfect-east to understand, easy to follow. Upon entering the caboose, I immediately felt at home. The smell was refreshing, the clean crisp look allowed me to relax right away. I loved the simplicity. I loved that it wasn't cluttered but yet it offered everything a guest needs. It was a bit cold for us to enjoy the outdoors but I enjoyed looking out the window at the peaceful surroundings, the adorable goats, and the pretty horse. I will definitely return as soon as I'm able to get away again. This place ranks my #1 out of any Airbnb I've been to and I've definitely been to alot of them. Thank you Ashley and Eric for a wonderful stay."

Stayed a few nights","Gosh this place was awesome!! We've stayed in over a dozen cabins, THW's, apartments, etc. This was our first caboose experience. We'd have to rank A&E's Caboose as one of our top stays...The Caboose itself was real cute and the interior was fantastic. They did a great job fixing it up and making it very cozy and convenient for most day to day living. Shower was great, cooking was easy, bed was comfy, temperature control was good, and now we are more appreciative fans of Uriah Heap and David Bowie LP's. It was enjoyable to walk around the semi-wooded property. There was a thing we saw that at first scared us, but upon closer inspection made us laugh, lol. Can't give away the surprise that was wearing a Christmas cap. Feeding the goats, horse, chickens, turkey, and one duck was fun...We visited several breweries and wineries in the area and participated in a craft activity down in McKinney. All in all a great place to stay and wonderful hosts."

Eric and Ashley have an incredibly secluded and cozy stay on the way to or out of the way from wherever you are.
Their attention to detail and hospitality, matched with the seclusion and natural surroundings of the property, work perfectly in tandem with the lovely caboose they refurbished. All the appliances are perfectly suited for the space and everything is very well curated.
Lots of thought and love went into this place.
Open nature in a private setting with the very well behaved farm animals that give you your space but serve to enhance its backdrop.
If you’re looking to get away to nature or stop somewhere to recharge, go see Eric and Ashley.
Absolute super hosts.
You don’t want to miss it."

I really liked that the windows have reflective glass so you don't feel the need to pull the shades in the daytime for privacy or to block out any heat. Everything ran perfectly. Ya might be cautious of falling acorns - I got pelted a few times - ha, but that comes with being in nature. Everything was so nice that I had trouble deciding whether I wanted to spend time inside or outside by the fire pit! Hard choice so I went back and forth often. :) Solo traveler recommended for sure.

Stayed a few nights","Loved every minute from start to finish! Even the drive there was very pretty and Whitesboro is full of horse farms, ranches, and green grass and trees for days! The road leading to the caboose was a tunnel of trees and so pretty too! The turn off was well marked with railroad crossing signs on the trees so you can’t miss it and it helped a lot. The caboose itself is just perfect and so cute. Ashley and Eric did a great job on it and you can tell a lot of hard work and heart went into it. It was super functional and comfortable and I loved the bed and shower! The farm animals are so cute and fun!! I really enjoyed Dave the horse he was so calm and sweet! It’s very peaceful out there and I enjoyed just walking around and taking it all in! Oh I also went paddleboarding at Moss Lake and it was so calm and pretty out there:) Thanks again Ashley snd Eric for being so helpful and kind!! Can’t wait to come back and bring the rest of my fam!"

The fireplace had wood ready next to it and it was clean and secluded. There were horse shoes outside and games inside if you don’t want to play the outside games. We appreciate the time and effort taken to make the caboose feel welcome and safe! 10/10 would recommend to anyone who needs a peaceful getaway!

Stayed a few nights","An amazing stay all around! The owners have done a great job converting this adorable caboose and providing a peaceful, clean, and cozy atmosphere. We loved enjoying the space inside as well as out — patio furniture was so comfortable we spent half our stay just enjoying the breeze and greenery with a good book. Was a little windy for the fire pit, but they made sure we had good logs for it just in case. Farm animals were SO cute and we loved watching the goats and horse roam around with the occasional dog or chicken. Owners were so kind and respectful of our space and time, but we highly recommend saying hello if you see them out and about!! We had a fun chat and got introduced to the animals, really cool people all around and you’ll be happy you did :D Also be sure to look at all the details in the caboose! We kept discovering little things like the dimmable lighting, speaker table, and vinyl records that really made the stay extra special. Can’t recommend this enough!"

Stayed with a pet","The Big Red Barn and Bed at Moo and Bray Farm was wonderful! The barn apartment was easy to find as Shannon gave excellent directions on how to find the property. Shannon had prepared a binder that gave instructions and also local recommendations for things to do and places to eat. The decor in the barn apartment was so unique and fun! My husband and I had a lot of fun reminiscing about some of the decor in the apartment. Everything was clean and tidy and we had all that we needed for a peaceful and very quiet weekend. It rained most of the weekend so we did not get a chance to see the cows, but Shannon did offer a tour Moo and Bray Farm. Definitely a place that is on our ""want to return to"" on Airbnb."

Stayed with a pet","The Moo & Bray is a great place to go for a quiet retreat. It is a very rural ranch setting in beautiful North Texas with highland cattle, donkeys and horses. Very scenic and very peaceful. The animals are all sweet & very friendly.
The bnb is a cute Western themed barndominium with great wifi, perfect for getting work done.
As stated in Shannon’s description, GPS does not really work out there, so follow her directions, they are spot on and will take you right to the bnb. I also had trouble with my cell phone signal that far out, but the wifi is very strong so I used wifi calling to bridge that gap.
Shannon is very friendly and always ready to help. Great place to get away for work or rest!"

As well the pups! You can tell by the way she speaks about them that she adores them. The Big Red Barn is beautiful and fun. It had all the essentials for cooking and relaxing. Shannon's place was the last stop on our trip, and it was definitely worth the wait!!"

I was a little sad… But at soon as I got there I wished I was all alone… Shannon put out super cute valentines decorations and the place is just so neat I fell in love as soon as I walked in the door… The next morning going to feed the animals and talking with Shannon about them was a great addition if you like cozy farm life you will love this spot… I plan to return with a few books and bottles of wine maybe in during fall all by myself and I can’t wait… I grew up in a very small town in east Texas so this was the best thing to me cozy romantic OMG and I almost forgot She had snacks and adult beverages it was really just THE BEST EVER I forgot all about not having a valentine Lol"

The host was attentive and responded so kindly to everything. 10/10 recommend! I hope they make an even bigger place at some point so we can bring friends. If you have well behaved dogs that you cannot leave behind, bring them with you! Best little get away! Our dogs enjoyed meeting the horses, cows, and donkeys. We will come back!"

Our host took us on a tour of the property and we met pigs, horses, Highland cows, alpacas and miniature donkeys. I got to hold a baby donkey!
I enjoyed exploring downtown Gainesville and Whitesboro. We’ll be back! Thank you Shannon and Chris"

Stayed with a pet","The owner was nice and the house was well maintained. However the pictures and listing werent depicted properly. It was much much smaller than we thought. We used a filter to find a place for 4 adults and a dog and this place showed as adequate. However after paying (non refundable) we were sent a message stating that while doable it would be very tight for 4 adults. So we had 2 adults find other accommodations. Glad we did, because when we got there the main bed was suppose to pull out to a king but there was only a single mattress and topper. The 2 of us had to sleep on the single bed. The two lofts were far to small to get into and they had a shared ladder even tho the lofts were across the room from each other. The ceiling in the bathroom was so small we were barely short enough to walk properly. Overall, we were disappointed due to the lack of information and transparency of the size since we paid well over market price for it."

Stayed one night","The entire stay couldn't have been better. The tiny house was quaint and to sit back in the morning enjoying your coffee and watching the horses was relaxing. The horse experience is a must, Melanie is very knowledgeable and her horses are well trained."
