Stayed a few nights","My husband and I booked this for our 2nd anniversary and it was just what we had hoped! It was secluded enough that it felt private, but we didn’t feel isolated away from civilization. Everything looked as described and we even got to enjoy a nice fire on our first night. We would stay here again!"

Only wish I could have enjoyed outside, it was ripe with mosquitos so could barely stay outside like I would have liked to. However, I will go back in the fall, and enjoy it then."

Stayed with a pet","Freda was clean, cozy, and the perfect tiny home for our anniversary trip! The host blew it out of the water with the extra details left (the mosquito wipes, tick spray, and s’more’s kit) especially since we brought our dog along!
We were so pleased with the clean and surprisingly nice bathroom and kitchen that looks just like the pictures. Especially with the provided utensils and items that may have been forgotten at home.
We’ve already recommended these cute getaways and plan on booking again!"

Stayed a few nights","I had wanted to try Getaway Brown County for a year now and was pleased to find listings on AirBNB, a platform I'm familiar with. There was a little lag in communication before checking in, but once I got there, I was very pleased with everything. They really thought of including everything for you - I had packed some seemingly extra items (lighters, a flashlight, first aid kit) and they already had those. It truly was grown-up camping, without needing to set up a tent or share a bathroom/showers with strangers! The roads to the site are gravel, so drive carefully. You're only 20 minutes or so away from Brown County State Park, my husband I spent an afternoon hiking, and the next day enjoying the sounds of the rain from within our cozy cabin. We will definitely be back!"

Stayed one night","It was horrible. I've never seen so many ticks in my life. I removed 50 of them from myself. The cabin was not equipped with internal ventilation. We stayed in a similar tiny house before, and there was ventilation in the main room. This time, we couldn't open the window due to heavy rain. Sleeping was uncomfortable. The air conditioner didn't help."

Stayed a few nights",It was a pretty area. And very quiet. We loved the view. But we wished we could have spent more time outside. Even with using the tick spray that they offered and our own we were still covered in them the second our shoes touched the gravel. Some ticks make sense. But to have coating objects outside makes it a little concerning. The last day of our stay we noticed sawdust material on the phone and light switches and watched little bugs pop in and out of the wall. Overall I’m sure that others stays are great. And we just got a one off fluke experience.

Stayed one night","So much better in person! I was continuously blown away by their thoughtfulness (s’mores and campfire kit, informative signs, other amenities). I would 100% stay again because of this. I found the nature trail with the dog potty station in front and it was a beautiful hike with so many flowers. Extremely dog friendly if I had brought mine. I could tell that they thought of every single scenario and need that each guest would have out there.
The perfect getaway from city life and the reset that I needed. With that nature view from the huge window and the light rain noises, I was able to have a great rest.
Brown County State Park was only 18 mins away, Little Nashville was under 30. I had a blast exploring all the shops."

Stayed a few nights",Just as the pictures show. The little smores kit was so cute and I loved the privacy. We had a little friendly raccoon come visit every night but as soon as we made noise and chased him away it was fine. The firepit and chairs nestled right against the woods was perfect for us to relax and connect. Everything was immaculate but I do recommend spraying because we had those big black ants everywhere but of course it's expected because you are in the wood. We Definitely recommend 👌

Stayed a few nights","5 stars for the Getaway house. 1 star for non-responsive hosts. The Getaway house was perfect, just as shown in photos. Very clean, cozy, beautiful surroundings. Recommend it to anyone wanting a restful and relaxing couple days off the grid. The problem was the hosts don’t respond. We arrived 20min early (240p) for a 3pm check-in. We notified the hosts and asked if we could go into the house a few minutes early (there was no one staying in or cleaning the house). No response. We messaged through the app and texted the phone number listed. No response. We called the number listed. No response. Finally at 305p (5min after check in) we called the main AirBnB line, who tried to contact the hosts. Finally at 330p - 30min after check in - we received two different codes to access the house, which was confusing. Bottom line - definitely stay in the house because it’s awesome but don’t expect the hosts to help you."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I stayed in a Getaway cabin for two nights. Wish we could of stayed longer! My first thought when we got inside the cabin was how clean everything was. I really loved all the extra touches(teas, coffee, bug spray, smores kit, ect.) put into the making the cabin welcoming. The veiw out of the large window was my absolute favorite aspect of the stay. The property was so beautiful as well, really appreciated how far apart each cabin was spaced. There was plenty of dry wood also provided which make our stay that much more relaxing. We will definitely be booking our next weekend away here! Thank you"

The road sign is difficult to see and, initially, I was concerned as there is a property in front that is very ""junkyard"", but once past that, the area that the cabins are in is secluded, beautiful, peaceful and wonderful. Highly recommend!a"

I am however very happy I did not get a spot that required steps to even get to the cabin. I have mobility issues (but I don’t require a full ADA style cabin) and while I am ok with stairs they did not have handrails. So if you have mobility issues make sure to let them know."

Stayed with a pet","The Getaway comes equipped with everything you need and then some! Great care was taken to anticipate needs and meet them. The home was cozy and well-appointed and maximized the outdoor space. We loved the big window and the encouragement to break away from devices to truly disconnect. Our only complaint: the bed was a bit too firm for our liking so we tossed and turned a lot (that’s just a matter of personal preference, though). I’d love an option to select a unit by mattress firmness in future. Also, the ticks were already an issue in early April. Not at all Getaway’s fault, obviously, but be aware and check yourselves and your dogs often!"

Stayed a few nights","For the price of nearly $450 for two nights…… I am fairly disappointed. The listing didn’t say anything about the extra costs for the amenities mentioned in the listing (firewood, boxed water, hot chocolate, s’mores, etc). The stove was still oily from the last guest spraying Pam all over. There were dirty smudges on the bathroom door. The exterior door have oily fingerprints on it. The places is about 120sqft. I don’t think I am expecting unreasonable cleaning standards between guests.
The bed was clean and the place was cute. Definitely wouldn’t do it again for the price."

Stayed with a pet","My significant other and I originally had plans for a different cabin however the cabin we reserved was just not what we were wanting. We found Getaways listing and made a last minute reservation. Getaway was very accommodating and quickly confirmed our reservation. This little camper was pretty perfect for a cozy weekend in nature. Our dogs loved the area and we had plenty of trails and walks to try out. We enjoyed all the amenities it had to offer! The beds do get really hot at night so we had to make sure we set the air on the right temp but other than that, we had a great stay. Our pups even got a special treat. Lastly there were other campers within our view however everyone was very respectful and kept to themselves!"

Stayed with a pet","This is definitely the place to go to to literally 'Getaway' ! It's a tiny cabin tucked into a wooded community of other tiny cabins! The only noise you hear is other guests driving to or from their own cabin! The great outdoors is your living room with nature as your TV!! This is the definition of simple living! The tiny cabin really helps you grow closer with your significant other because there's no room to have any ""space"" lol. My husband and I loved the simplicity of this stay and will be back very frequently!"

I read all of the books provided; even bought one. the space was larger then I expected so I was comfortable with just me. the shower had hot water and good pressure; shampoo conditioner and body wash mounted right inside. I'm a tall plus size woman and the shower head wasn't too low and I was able to shower without being cramped. bathroom wasn't too small either. I love all the storage so not to be cluttered. the outside fit pit and chairs were nice. there was a fire ban when I attended but everything for a fire was provided including a smore kit. Bed was comfortable. Outside was very quiet everyone was respectful of each other privacy. check in was super easy and all cabins were clearly marked and there was a posted map right at the gate just to check before entering. overall was a great experince."

There was a burn ban when we stayed, but the fire pit with lawn chairs would have been a great place to relax by. The kitchenette was well equipped so we were able to cook despite not being able to use the campfire.

Especially in a winter month when there are no leaves on the trees, you can easily see your neighbors. Cabins are quite close to the street and each other. But once you’re inside it still feels private because the big window faces the woods. The cabin is very clean and the design is lovely. It is very small but cozy. Note: There is a county fire ban that looks like it will stay in place until April 12 from what I’ve read online. We were not allowed to have any kind of campfire at all, which was a big disappointment. But obviously not their fault. I think overall this cabin is better for one night than for 2, especially with not being able to make any camp fire. There is a nice hiking trail on the property. Brown County state park trails about 30 mins away."

There was a strong smell, like a cigarette smoke smell and then there was a mouse in the trailer eating the unopened groceries we had. We had to open up the windows and allow it to out. It was almost unbearable."

Something about being in nature is just good for the soul. These cabins are the best airbnb I’ve ever rented. In the description, it says “The cabin has everything that you need & nothing that you don’t need”, and that’s exactly what you’ll find. Getting away from technology and playing cards and being in nature is so healthy. What an iconic idea, we are already booking our next trip. We’re planning on traveling around the country as Getaway has Cabins in many places. Thank you, truly."

Stayed a few nights","We had a great time on our trip! The cabin looks just as described and the amenities were great. We loved the s’mores kits and the fire pit. It was a short drive to everything.
The only mild complaint we had is that the overhead photo on the listing shows longer driveways to the cabins and more privacy than in reality. If you step outside the cabin there is no privacy meaning no privacy at the fire pit. We could see at least 4 other cabins and their occupants when outside. From our big window we could see another cabin and their fire pit and vehicle and could see them turning on and off lights in their cabin at night (we did visit in a winter month so if the trees were full there would likely be less visibility). This did not affect our enjoyment much and we would definitely visit again but we were a little surprised when we arrived because of the pictures in the listing."

Stayed with a pet","Our stay was incredible. The second we walked in, we knew we’d found a spot we’ll return to again and again. The setting and views are incredible, of course, but the amenities are exceptionally thoughtful. We had our dogs with us, and bowls, treats, etc. were provided for our stay; there was even a tie-out attached to the picnic table so they could roam a bit without being off-leash. We had an incredible time.
One note I’ll add for future guests is that the address provided leads you to a sign that says “staff only,” and there are a number of no-trespassing signs associated with a house on the same road. I’m still not quite sure what the setup is there but it made finding the spot initially a little confusing."

Both of us use a C-pap and the way the bed is set up against the end wall it isn't easy to set up the machine for the person sleeping against the wall. Will definitely consider renting from them again.

Not getaways fault just a disclaimer for fellow pet owners to consider. It was every time they went outside we found ticks on her. Other than that place has all you need and is fun. It is very small if small ain’t your thing and cramped then don’t do this one. Otherwise a great time we really enjoyed ourselfs."

But other than that the cabin was well worth it. Didnt like that they are so close together that i can see all of our neighbors but at least we cant look in eachothers windows. The drive in was pretty treacherous and would probably be very difficult for smaller cars, especially in the rain. Overall great experience and only 20mins away from Nashville. Lots of conflicting information about weather the firewood and smores are complimentary. Please make it clear somewhere on the booking site."

We brought our Golden Retriever, and Getaway was so accommodating. They left little dog bowls and doggie bags, which was so thoughtful. We walked the nature path at the back of the property and we loved it! We also hit some trails and shops in Brown County and it was a short 20 minute drive to downtown Nashville.
We even struggled with some snow, getting out of the drive, and their staff was already onsite and came up to offer us traction mats. They were around and available, but not too much in our space.
10/10 would recommend for a private, serene setting."

There was some strange confusion though about provisions (fire wood, coffee, s'mores, etc) inside and at the location. The listing says some things are included, like fire wood and s'mores for example, but when you enter the cabin you will find a list of items that will cost extra. Fire wood and s'mores are on this list. (Unless this is changed by the time you are reading this. which hopefully it is.) That said, I haven't gotten a bill for the items I used, and when I messaged the host they didn't answer my question about if they were included or not. Hopefully this confusion is cleared up before your stay."

Stayed one night","I absolutely LOVED staying here with Getaway. In fact, I loved it so much that I actually booked another night. The team was super responsive and helpful in getting me another night and reimbursing me so I wasn't paying a cleaning fee twice. This tiny house looked EXACTLY like the pictures and the woods were even more stunning in person. They even have a private walking trail, which is nice (though it's made of chunky rocks, not gravel, so bring good shoes). The amenities were great. The only downsides were that they mean it when they say there is a small hot water tank. I only had hot water for about 5 minutes both times I took a shower. The only other thing to warn about (which this is in no way Getaway's fault) is that the property is surrounded by a bunch of private property where people hunt, so you will hear occasional gunshots. Overall however, I had an amazing time and this place was the exact amount of peaceful and loveliness that I needed. Thank you, Getaway."

It offers comfortable beds, a roomy layout, plus the convenience of an in-unit laundry. Jay is also a thoughtful host: I forgot a sweater as I packed up, and when I reached out later, Jay offered to leave it for me to pick up on our way home. We'd be glad to stay here again when we come back for one of Columbus's interesting architectural tours."

Jay was a great host ! with prompt responses and easy to understand, clear answers.
His place was PERFECT for us.
First of all it was very close to where we needed to be (within walking distance).
Secondly it was very comfortable and clean. Making it feel like a home away from home atmosphere.
We are hoping to come again in a few months.
PS: It was wonderful to have things available that we had forgotten ( hand lotion, coffee creamer)
Saving us an early morning run to the store. 😀"

The place is exactly as pictured, and we liked walking to everything. We did wish there was a screen door to let in some fresh air. If you're a light sleeper, bring some earplugs as the trains pass close by at night. La Michoacana for ice cream is also close by, with some fun flavors you'll not find at a DQ.

Stayed over a week","I have been traveling to Seymour for a year for my job. Most of the time I was in Seymour more than I was at home so I wanted somewhere to stay that would make me feel like I was at home. I stayed in 2 of his bnbs but this was my favorite. For part of the year I shared it with another traveler. It has a large bathroom with 2 sinks which was great. It has 2 beds, one a bit more firm while the other is softer, but both great. I really appreciated the full kitchen, a girl can only Door Dash so much so it was great to be able to make food. It was very well supplied with anything you could need. Shawn as a host is great! Communicates very quickly and stays on top of getting you clean towels and sheets. He was very considerate of my work schedule ( night shift) and always asked if it would be a good time to bring something. I’m very happy I found this as my home away from home and would definitely stay again."

Stayed over a week","This space was perfect for an extended stay. I stayed here for 10 weeks and I had almost everything I needed between towels, sheets, and kitchen utensils. My only issue was the kitchen sink sprayer hose didn’t work and the faucet water spewed when you used full pressure. Shawn was very communicative and frequently checked in to see if I needed sheets and towels and general cleaning. It was a bit pricey, even with the extended-stay discount. Other than that, I had no issues. I would recommend this loft to anyone who would want to visit, whether it be a quick weekend trip or a long-term stay."

Stayed one night","Such an unique experience! The place was charming and adorable! Everything was clean. The water pressure/heat was good, plenty of space throughout for three women getting ready for a conference. The beds were a nice surprise. Queen memory foam/therapeutic feel. The beds are med firm with soft feel on top, but no sinking whatsoever. ❤️ Snacks, coffee and water available. Bathroom amenities if needed. The temp was set just right, no adjustment needed and usually one of us is cold while the other is more hot-natured.
The windows in the place allow for natural light in the morning. I am one who likes the room pitch black, and forgot to bring my sleeping mask :/ However, the sunrise and the natural light made everything feel cozy, bright and happy. :) I don’t get to see it often, so it didn’t bother me for one night.
We would love to stay again next year during our conference if there is availability. Host was fast in responding and available for anything we needed or questions we had. Area was safe, and quiet. Plus there is a diner across the street that smelled wonderful when you were outside :)
Def a 5-star experience!"

My only criticism, and I am nitpicking here, is that a few of the uprights on the outdoor stair bannister seemed a little loose. The stairs themselves are fairly new and sturdy, as are the rails, but the spindles did give me pause. Regardless, would definitely stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","This Airbnb was absolutely fabulous: Clean, Easy Check-In, Plenty of room, etc. It has a nice large bathroom with double sinks, comfy beds, great kitchen, etc. Close to everything such as good shopping and restaurants.
A long-time friend and I took a Road Trip to see the Mellencamp mural. There is so much more to see and do in town! We took the Mellencamp driving tour. You may purchase a CD at the Visitor's Center, but check the hours before you go. We made it to town and they were to close in the next ten minutes. The young lady on duty waited for us and was so helpful!!!
We visited the music store next to the mural, purchased t-shirts and visited with the owner for quite some time. Everyone we met in Seymour was so helpful and nice!
We ate @ Vat & Barrel, a local brewery, where both owners visited with us and made us feel so welcome. We had an early brunch @ Larrison's Diner and the food was spot-on. If you like pizza, Seymour Brewing/Pizza Co. was excellent and we highly recommend for a late lunch or dinner.
We highly recommend this property and a visit to Seymour, IN! We had such a great stay!!"

For the most part we were able to walk anywhere from the apt and when we wanted to just hang at the apt it was so nice to sit and watch a bit of Netflix...truly felt like home.
We are hoping to make it back in town sometime...we are definitely looking up Shawn once again.

I would have appreciated knowing before booking. A paved walkway to side of cabin would have been great help. A back step would be a great addition to your cabin. The rains made the getting from car to steps difficult to avoid the mud. We found large bugs in cabin each night of our stay. Not flying bugs but crawling type. Gaps between walls and flooring likely contributed to this problem."

Stayed one night","The visual aesthetics alone make their place worth booking. Property is gorgeous and the newly built cabin is decorated beautifully. It was only two of us but the cabin can perfectly accommodate 4. We arrived at night so we weren’t aware of the creek until we heard it while sitting on the porch the next morning. It is on the other side of the barn; we encourage you to walk to property. Kristy and Austin checked in intermittently to make sure all was well, which was appreciated. Just a few minutes drive outside of downtown, which was pretty in itself. One of my favorite touches was the guest book, where past guests have noted where they came from and info about their stay in the air bnb. PS- hot tub in the works! Can’t wait to be back."

The location provided a nice blend of being close to downtown Madison (and even closer to the hilltop business district) yet out in the country, away from it all. Kristy and Austin were great hosts. One thing to be aware of -- the two-lane road to get to the house is twisty with some sharp turns. So drive carefully!"

With us coming from the TX panhandle, Madison was a 14 hr drive for us and a 10 hr drive for her. But we'd love to go back for the beauty, the attractions and the comfortable accomodation. Enjoyed antique shopping, touring the Lanier Mansion, Clifty State Park, Versailles State Park, and lots of game playing and homecooked meals in the cabin. Thank you Austin and Kristi! You have a true jewel in this cabin and your homestead!!"

I don’t think Darci forgot one detail! Amenities and supplies were above and beyond what I have found at other places we have stayed. Decor was outstanding and it was very clean! We will recommend to our friends and family, if they need a place to stay in Seymour."

You thought of everything and made us feel so welcome. We didn’t want to leave and we are so thankful for making our Christmas 2023 stay such a dream. We would love to come every year for Christmas.

Stayed with kids","The thought and love that has gone into Darci’s place is obvious from the moment we entered. It’s comfortable, beautiful, and immaculate. (Not to mention fun - our teens and tween loved everything from the coffee bar to the spiral stairs)! We came into town after dark, and as we parked on the street below, the lights in the apartment above were shining warmly and a Christmas tree was lit in the window. Everything about our experience communicated welcome.
Check in/out was simple, we felt safe and secure, and our only regret was that we were just there overnight. We would have loved to have had time to explore downtown and relax longer in this lovely space. As book lovers with a couple gluten free members, we were thrilled to see a bookstore with a gluten free cafe right across the street. Alas, both businesses are closed on Sundays, so we missed out on that, but we hope to be back to stay longer when we are traveling through again. Darci is friendly, accommodating, and responsive."

Darci was responsive to my messages both before my trip and throughout my stay, giving me recommendations fitting to my interests. She’s an incredible host.

Positives:
The place was beautiful
There was a fire pit that gave us opportunity to spend time outside.
We could bring 1 of our dogs
The outside porch had a Locked gate
There were plenty of pillows and blankets
There were starter items available such as trash bags, laundry detergent, and dishwashing detergent
Cooking ware was amazing and not perfect
There was a grill that we were able to use
The location was very close to the state park and amazing flea market
Opportunities for improvement:
Noisy at times due to nearby highway - More trees would help w/ sound and did not negatively impact stay.
We brought our dog because site said pet friendly. Unfortunately, a pet charge didn’t populate on the site when booking so did not know until arrival that bringing him required a charge. - but the charge was only $50 and issue was resolved quickly.
Overall - it was beautiful and amazing. Would definitely stay again."

At first, we didn't mind, but then the barking seemed to get worse, and it really put a dent in our peaceful weekend. Our own dog seemed stressed about it and was anxious to leave the property. While the cabin was lovely, and in a good spot for us, we wouldn't choose to stay again."

The barn is beautiful and the property has two other historical buildings Melinda is fixing up. We can't wait to come back and see how wonderful it will be!"

Stayed with a pet","This is a quaint and comfortable stay. The town of our Versailles is nearby and is beautiful with cute places to stop on the Square. Madison is nearby and is a gorgeous town on the Ohio river.
My single complaint is that the Wi-Fi was down and I was not aware of that prior to coming. I had to use a hotspot to connect to the Internet to work. Unfortunately, cell service is not strong and so I could not maintain web conference calls in the Airbnb and ended up having to sit in my car at the Square where I had better service. It would have been helpful to know of this issue prior to the stay. I brought my puppy with me and did not bring his travel crate, as I was not expecting to be away from him, but did end up having to leave him to do a couple of work calls downtown."

She also left muffins and chocolate for us upon arriving. We were so touched and amazed. The place itself is so cozy and inviting and beautifully decorated. It had all the amenities of home. The cookware was top of the line. We loved cooking dinners and eating at the dining table each night. There were book and games to choose from. The beds were comfortable. The kitchen was well stocked. The bedrooms were adorable. It was so nice having a washer and dryer also to use. This place felt so welcoming and cozy. If you find yourself traveling in this area, give yourself a treat and stay here. You will feel right at home!"

Stayed a few nights","Tranquil Terrace was the perfect house for our family get together. The house has a nice layout with plenty of sleeping options, to include air mattresses and toddler mattress. The house has everything you need, and the hosts left hand soap, shampoo, conditioner and body soap in both bathrooms—which rarely do we find in other rentals homes. They also had a first aid kit with band aids (which we needed to use). Also, the kitchen is well equipped to include spices and condiments. We ordered Walmart grocery delivery and had a BBQ one night and then cooked a Sunday brunch. They even had an indoor griddle that we used for pancakes! The most important part of the amenities was the basket of toddler toys that was a game changer for our 2 year old granddaughter. Plus books and games that all of us played every day and evening—unplugged family time! We also used the outdoor fire place which is beautiful. Hands down, the BEST rental we’ve had thru Airbnb! Thank you!"

Michael’s instructions about getting into the home was clear and the process was flawless. There was a manual with helpful information as well and Michael was proactive with giving contact information if we had any issues (which we didn’t). The home was comfortable and had everything we needed. One of us drank coffee and she appreciated the kurig with pods (although she brought her own). The bedrooms allowed us each to have our own space. There was complete privacy in the back and having the sun stream in through the kitchen and living room was cozy on a chilly day. The property sits close to an air field but the small plane traffic was not bothersome. The guests in the front bedrooms had to contend with some street traffic but they were able to fall asleep quickly enough after a full day of excursions. Great stay"

My husband enjoyed using the grill (and we enjoyed that he did too). The master bath was lovely. The open kitchen-dining-living area allowed us to share conversation easily. All of the beds provided a great night’s sleep. The upstairs bonus room was our granddaughter’s favorite place to be! She expended much time and energy going up and down the stairs and was delighted to do so!!
The many things that you take for granted at home were there, which also made it especially comfy and welcoming. There were plenty of linens and pillows. We used the sewing kit and the hot water bottle. The crock pot was a welcome sight. There was also that one drawer in the kitchen with a tape measure, matches, scissors, pencil sharpener and other odds and ends. (We used that too!!)
We will definitely look for Michael’s place in the future!!"

Check in was simple and easy.
Nice assortment of coffees and teas.
We mostly ate out, but i noticed the kitchen was well equipped and had everything needed to prepare a meal.
Only negative. The third bedroom had a daybed/trundle bed setup. Great for kids, but our group was middle to old age. Not very comfortable. I think two twin beds would have worked so well for our group.
We were aware of this set up going in to our weekend, but all other aspects of the house were perfect, so we made do."

There are even toys for children, which our two year old enjoyed. The house is spacious and has an upstairs, baby gated, bonus room. The internet was great and one of us was easily able to work remotely. The showers were wonderful, with plenty of hot water and great water pressure. The kitchen had everything we wanted, and we home cooked most of our meals for the month. I highly recommend this home and we will gladly stay here again whenever we need an Airbnb in this area."

Also loved the kid-friendly things -- high chair, potty seat, toys, games, baby gate, etc! Super handy. I actually forgot to pack our potty seat, so I was way too thrilled to find one in the bathroom lol.

The communication with Michael and his daughter (who helps manage the home) was easy and helpful. This place made us feel right at home. I've described it as feeling like you're staying at your aunt and uncle's house and they're just out of town. We truly felt right at home and peaceful for a few days. I absolutely recommend this place, and will be back if/when I need to stay near Columbus again. It was also 8-12 minutes to anything you could want and need - perfect location. It was also extremely clean; this was the happiest I've been with cleanliness in any airBNB I've ever stayed. 100% recommend -- thank you, Micheal + family!"

The fish tank was also a favorite attraction for our kids!"

Every room was meticulously prepared, with thoughtful touches like tissue boxes conveniently placed throughout the house, ensuring that our needs were always met. The cleanliness of the house, along with the impeccable condition of the furniture and linens, truly exceeded our expectations.
One of the highlights of our stay was the well-equipped kitchen, which made preparing meals a breeze.
Additionally, having access to the garage was a fantastic convenience, especially when it came to packing and unpacking our belongings. It made the entire process so much smoother and more efficient.
Overall, our experience at Maleha's house was absolutely wonderful. We felt right at home from the moment we arrived, and we can't wait to ret"

Stayed one night","Johnathan and Renae went ABOVE and BEYOND to make our stay a great one! I have never left a review as good as the one you are about to see here!
They brought in some TV trays for us since I was concerned that the kitchen table wouldn't be large enough for an elaborate game (it was). I had asked if we needed to pick up creamer before arrival since many places provide the powdered stuff. They got us two types of CoffeMate creamer, a fresh bottle of 2% milk, orange juice and even FRESH apple fritters for the morning!
We were thrilled 😄!
The refrigerator was full of yogurts, fresh fruits, assorted canned drinks, and a little alcohol. The array of breakfast and snacks provided was impressive.
The bathroom had extra toothbrushes and toothpaste, soaps, shampoos, wet wipes...pretty much anything you might need.
Being a shutterbug, I decided to take a bunch of photos for them to add to their listing if they want.
We will definitely stay again!"

First stay we've had that provided toothbrush and toothpaste which is amazing because somehow someone always forgets it at home. Osgood is a small quiet town and it was a treat to stay in the town my mother in law was born and raised. We played the games that were provided and if we needed something the dollar store was in walking distance. We will be back, Johnathan had the best response when we asked about bringing our pets. He understood they were family too and now we have a home away from home 😍."

This house was stocked with EVERYTHING. I would describe this air bnb as better stocked with everything we needed better than our own home. XD This is a great place to stay with kids as the home is super kid friendly. There isn’t much for our kids to get into. Some air bnb properties have been stressful to bring our kids to with decor or a layout that tempts the kids into damaging items. They had a cute little table with toys for our kids and even left little dog bowls and food for our pets that we brought with us. We felt completely comfortable here. Our favorite family-friendly property we’ve stay so far. We will be back!

Stayed about a week","This is the 2nd time Ihave stayed at Jonathan place as I was volunteering for a mountain bike festival at Versailles State Park (hassmerfestival) and the location was very close.
the use if the 2 garage is a big bonus since I could store 4 bicycles and truck inside.
the neighborhood is very quiet and neighbors are respectful.
this is my only choice to stay in this area!
Shopping:
The local meat market Reihls and deli had great ground chuck 80/20 and reasonable price.
Restaurants:
Highly recommend: 1.Crossroads in Versailles and get the tenderloin sandwich. Tenderloin breaded and as big as your head!
2. Wagners in Oldenberg IN. Fried chicken at its best! Fried in cast iron skillets and served family style. Don't expect quick meal as it takes time to get chicken like your grandmother used to make!"

I wish that their coffee shop downstairs was in my neighborhood- I would be there every day. I only share the below cautions to prepare you and I encourage you not to let them turn you off. Great place and great people.
A few cautions.
1) Steep stairs, though even my stair-phobic wife made it with no problem.
2) Noisy trains overnight. I find the train noise soothing, but grew up with it. My family members who are less used to it found it bothersome.
3) Heat needs to be up a bit higher to get into the bedrooms. Leave the doors open for the best circulation."

Stayed a few nights","The apartment above the coffee shop is great! It retains the character of the old building that it is in, while having modern appliances and all of the modern amenities. It is an AMAZING space! It was way larger than I expected, has good parking and easy access, and is in a great spot in downtown Seymour where it's only 5 minute's walk to a few good restaurants. The coffee shop below is also excellent. I can't recommend it enough!"

Be warned Seymour has a train track running through the middle of town and the train runs on schedule with horns blaring quite early.
The space Montika has created is beautiful and I enjoyed my restful evenings there. Thanks!"

Stayed a few nights",My boyfriend and I stayed here while visiting my brother in Seymour. We loved this space. It’s located right above the movie coffee shop in the heart of downtown Seymour. We loved waking up to the smell of coffee and popping down stairs for a complementary drink! The almond milk lattes are to die for . Montica was super sweet and helpful if we had any questions. We’ll absolutely look to stay here again next time we visit.

Stayed a few nights","We are from Massachusetts. When we journey to the Midwest we are always charmed by the historic small towns and the friendliness of the residents. Seymour, Indiana is no exception.
Montica’s Air BandB is somewhat of a time travel…a late 1800s building, floors and windows that resonate with that era. Stand at the front windows and blur your vision a bit. Just like a movie that floats back in time, you will be transported as you imagine the turn of the century here. Sit in the living area and you are mid century modern. Prepare a meal in the kitchen, you are squarely in 2023.
This was the most spacious two bedroom we have seen in our travels. We will return and always feel at home.
Dint miss this opportunity if you are passing through."

Stayed with kids","Such a unique and beautiful apartment. It is very spacious, and well laid out. We were very comfortable and enjoyed hanging out in the main living area. They do have open stairs, but also provided a baby gate. We had our 3 little boys there and did find having our own gate with us as well (the apartment is vintage so the doorways were open to the hallway with the stairs.
It is right above their own coffee shop, and the drinks were great! They were very generous in offering free coffee the next morning. Cute little area, that felt safe, and seems very walkable. Parking was easy."

Stayed a few nights","Airbnb above a coffee shop in downtown Seymour (the town where John Mellencamp is from). Parking is at the rear of the building in the back of a little square park between buildings. The little park has flowers and squirrels. You enter directly into the unit, but take a floor of steps to get to the second floor of the building where the rooms are. Note you do have to be able to walk up steps. Not a problem for us, but might be for some people. You then enter a long hallway that leads to the living room/kitchen. Along the hallway are the bathroom (there is only one), a small laundry area with a washer and dryer, and two bedrooms. In the bathroom is a walk in shower with great water pressure. We all absolutely loved the shower. Both bedrooms had beds with foam mattresses. The kitchen is a full kitchen with microwave, refrigerator/freezer, stove, oven, dishwasher. There is a bootlegger hidden panel in the floor of the kitchen/living room where you might find some liquor."

The attention to detail and a few extras (snacks and coffee) were really appreciated. Initially, I was a little worried the coffee shop downstairs would be loud in the mornings but we could hardly hear it at all. In fact, the smell of coffee in the morning was wonderful! It was nice to hang out with the locals in the morning downstairs and get the 'inside scoop' on the area."

Stayed a few nights","So clean, so convenient, so thoughtfully appointed! This was an A+ experience. Many rental spaces fail to strike the right balance between being well stocked with amenities and pleasing decorations and having sufficient space for the renters' ""stuff."" A kitchen shouldn't be so crammed with cooking/serving gear that there is no space for a renter's groceries, but neither should the cupboards and fridge be bare of helpful supplies. Jennifer's place was frankly perfect. It was cute, comfortable, and accommodating, offering thoughtful supplies and comforts but still leaving plenty of space to enable us to settle in and feel at home. The lighting was good, the beds and bedding comfy, the electric outlets convenient, the window treatments offering good privacy, and the overall feeling very safe and secure. Big thumbs up!

Stayed with kids","Was a great place to explore Columbus and Nashville! If you have toddlers and kids this is a great find, Jennifer has thought of everything from a baby sling, booster seat, kids plates and cups, toy chest, lots of books and games. My kids were entertained the whole time and kept wanting to go back to play at the house! Great indoor playground at The Commons close by and Lucabe has amazing coffee and also a play area for kids that’s 2 min away. We’d definitely stay again if we visit the area!"

The property matches the description exactly, no surprises.
The place is adorable inside and has everything you need.
The kitchen is well stocked to cook meals if you want to.
The bathroom (water pressure, overall condition) was great.
The space was clean and I felt safe and cozy.
The host was friendly and responsive.
You are close to everything (Target, food, gas), but tucked away.
I would absolutely book this place again in the future.
Thank you for sharing your place!"

There are loads of towels and hot water and bedding, the kitchen basics you need, a washer and drier, a little dining nook, and off-street parking in this safe residential neighborhood. Some special touches: TVs in each of the bedrooms, in addition to the big living room TV, and a collection of board games if you prefer not to watch TV. The front porch features a nice porch swing! The street traffic outside is a bit busy at evening rush hour but the rest of the time is light and unobstrusive. We are very glad we stayed in this relaxing home and we recommend it highly."

Stayed with kids","Annette's home was beautiful. We had a great time staying at Otter Ridge with our family. They provided all the amenities and essentials we needed for our stay. This home is in a peaceful setting surrounded by forest where you can relax and enjoy the river behind the house. There was plenty of space for our family to enjoy time together or get some time to themselves. Annette's home is also beautifully decorated, has a great kitchen and the beds were very comfy."

Group trip","Annette was very friendly and easy to communicate, even in the weeks leading up to our stay. Once we were checked in, she was very easily reachable about any questions we had regarding the cabin or the area. There were even more furnishings and amenities than we realized once we got settled in. The cabin is beautiful down to every small detail and all of the windows as well as the setback into the woods give it a really isolated and relaxing feel to the environment. You feel as though you have the entire area to yourself. The creek directly behind the cabin is such a tranquil addition to the relaxation. Drinking coffee early in the morning on the beautiful balcony while listening to the water flow is an unrivaled experience. We stayed at Annette’s cabin while visiting family, and we will most definitely be looking to reserve it again on our next visit."

Group trip","We used this property for our work crew. All of them had very positive thoughts. Here are a few:
""Would definitely stay again and recommend. Amazing house and hospitality. ""
""Clean very nice place. Beds were nice and soft nice TVs she extras snacks plenty of towels.""
""Everything was awesome, you could write a novel on the deck it was so beautiful and peaceful. All the beds and furniture were comfortable, with all the amenities. The owners were incredibly nice and accommodating. I went there for work and am now planning to bring my wife and kids back for a vacation. 5 stars!""
Annette was very easy for us to work with and very accomodating. The place had everything our crew of 8 guys needed. The deck was surely a big hit! The guys appreciated the multiple bathrooms, and abundance of towels. It was a nice change of pace from the hotels they are accustom to; easy to come home after work, clean up, eat, and relax. They hope we have more work in the area!"

Kelly went above and beyond to make sure we were all set for the eclipse and even left us the appropriate eclipse viewing glasses. All the amenities as described in the listing plus more. Kelly was incredibly responsive in all of our communication. There were a number of plug-in room freshener scents that were quite overwhelming for us. If this is something you are sensitive to I'm sure. Kelly would accommodate having them unplugged ahead of time. We had a great long weekend!
It's very obvious that kelly enjoys sharing her own home."

Stayed with a pet","This home is the cutest! It’s smells so good and clean. When you walk in you instantly feel cozy and invited! I would’ve stayed longer if I could but just passing through on a last minute cross country trip. I was traveling with my two dogs. Kelly goes above and beyond! She left treats out for them, a full water bowl, and toys! Her yard was PERFECT! Completely enclosed and private. I love the lights too! We got in at 2am and I didn’t worry about my dogs being wound up from the trip because they were able to run and get all their energy out before we climbed into bed. Room was perfect had everything you need. I think she lives there, but isn’t there when guests stay, and it’s actually nice because there’s a lot of things in the home that make it feel… well like home! I LOVED the decor especially the ones that have sayings from new girl & the office, so cute! Thank you again Kelly for sharing your home, it was perfect!"

When you stay in a persons actual home you’ll find it to be more practical and comfortable, as this one is, because someone lives there. All the amenities needed are available. The backyard is lovely in the evening and after dark. If you are in Greensburg and need a home away from home you can find one here. Thanks for sharing!"
