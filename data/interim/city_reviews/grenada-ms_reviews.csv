Group trip","This place was a perfect get away. We choose to get an air bnb because we were visiting Grenada for Mother's day weekend and the hotels were too expensive. The property sits on a lot of land, plenty of parking, easy check in and they had everything as far as appliances go to entertain or cook meals. Nice seating areas include a garage and a back patio and deck where I spent a lot of time alone when I needed to. It was perfect I will definitely consider staying here whenever I am in Grenada in the future. Thank You Phillip! My family was happy with this place as well. My only compliant is having to leave too soon with the early check out."

Stayed a few nights","The first morning we tried to use the cieling fan in the dining area. It shorted out and tripped the circuit breaker. Tied to the same breaker is the lights to the kitchen and dining areas. It made it difficult to see and cook for 2.5 days of our 3.5 day stay. Granted, this occurred on Sunday, the owner came out that day, checked it, and said he could not fix it. He said he was going to call an electrician but one did not arrive during our stay. We would have rated the stay higher but for this problem. It is a great value, plenty of parking for aur vehicles and boat. I would recommend this to others if the lighting is fixed."

Stayed one night","Adorable cabin surrounded by woods and very close to Hugh White State Park on Grenada Lake. We had a road emergency and needed a place to spend the night at the last minute. It was already pretty late when we booked the cabin and Kristi responded right away. The cabin we originally booked wasn't quite ready for guests, so Kristi asked if it was ok if we took a smaller one. We were fine with that. And they accept pets, which was a big plus for our needs. The cabin was clean and comfortable. It has all the amenities you need whether staying for a night or several days. We would gladly stay there again."

Nice outside area with fire pit and grill, it was to cold to be outside though, but there was a wood burning fireplace inside that we loved. Door between living areas and bedrooms that could be shut for early risers or night owls. Well stocked kitchen if you want to eat in but still close enough to several restaurants. Loved the place."

Stayed a few nights","We were in town to fish the local lakes, and this could not have been a better location for that activity. We met our guide literally across the street each day, and Grenada Lake is just minutes down the road. Nanette's house is ideal for 2-4 people coming to the area for fishing. That's all we did, so I unfortunately can't comment on any other activities. Very comfortable and clean place to stay."

I didn't reach out to host because it wouldn't have changed the outcome of the shower. Second is that there is no way to turn the outside lights off in the courtyard so they shine into the room and light it up. So if you like dark dark rooms this is not one of those. The house was great and the entrance and exit couldn't have been easier."

Stayed a few nights","We booked this place at the last minute and what a find! I drove up from New Orleans for the Ole Miss game and this place was right near the Coffeeville exit. The three bedrooms were clean and spacious and chocolate treats and a selection of creme breads were set out for us. We got in very late on Friday and it was still a very easy check in. The house has a fair amount of land that allows you to enjoy nature and disconnect a bit. It was fun to pet the donkeys and look at the emus next door too.
During my trip I had an allergic reaction to seafood and Ruthie sent over some Benadryl. It was so kind of them. When I told her my son was fascinated with her record player (Ruthie does auctions so the house has neat knickknacks and decorations) she secretly dropped off some albums so he and I could bond over how I used to have to listen to my favorite songs. It was quite fun playing records and singing to Queen.
As far as location it was an easy drive to Oxford and it cut my drive back to New Orleans by an hour going home on Sunday- Giving us more time to enjoy this wonderful little getaway.
I just keep thinking, ugh I hate to write all this good stuff, because when I go back again, the secret will be out and it will be booked! Thank you Ruthie, we had a great time."

I have to admit made hubby drive us to Spencer's Ice Creamry just for a late night Sundae.
Brian and Terie were just across the pond if we needed them but never needed a thing so just a friendly wave to them as we were going and coming. WIFI was great for our Verizon service even under a canopy of trees.

Stayed a few nights","This is a perfect spot for a group wanting to fish or hunt. Very close to boat launch, Hugh White State Park and golf course. Cabin is basic and has just about everything you would need. Two bedrooms upstairs each held a double bed and a single. There is a couch downstairs, but not a sleeper. Host were very friendly and helpful. We rented last-minute. There were coffee and snacks in a basket on the kitchen table. However there was no sugar. There was no cooking oil at the cabin but they brought some right over. They were also helpful when I accidentally locked us out of the cabin! There is a porch swing that looks down over the pond, which I enjoyed in the evenings after a day of fishing.
The only reason I did not give 5 stars were for the following: the lighting, especially in the kitchen need to be brighter. The couch in living room was uncomfortable. There was no wifi (which I knew when I booked). It would be nice to have a TV in the bedroom. Also the double bed was way too small for my husband and I. He ended up sleeping on the single. For a group of guys on a fishing trip, this would not be an issue, but for a couple it would be nice to have had at least a queen-size bed in one of the rooms.
We would rent this place again if we go back to Grenada Lake to fish!
Thanks, Brian for a nice week away!"

Stayed with kids","This was the perfect choice for our family’s getaway to do a little fishing on Grenada and Enid Lake. It’s close to a launch (Piney Woods Landing launch) but close enough that you can still make a trip to town for food or bait. We fell in LOVE with the cabin, which is just simple, rustic, and homey. The kids enjoyed doing a little fishing in the lake next to the cabin and running off some energy on the trail to the lake behind the cabin. If you’re looking for a quiet getaway, this is it."

Stayed a few nights","First let me start off by saying - 2020 has been an unkind year and extremely rough on my family. When searching for a place to stay this Labor Day weekend, I was in search of a place tucked in the woods, away from everything, with the ability to allow me to just disconnect and recharge my soul... that is exactly what I found here.
My family of 5 (3 middle school aged children) and our dog found the perfect little hideaway with Brian's cabin. The second we entered the cabin, we were welcomed with: a basket of snacks, a bookshelf full of games (chicken dominoes was our favorite), and enough privacy and space to really enjoy our time together.
Brian and his wife really took the extra step and went the extra mile in their thoughtfulness - from toiletries to a binder full of local restaurant menus to messages with suggested hiking trails, their hospitality truly was so appreciated and heartfelt.
I especially loved the porch swing, waking up at 6:30 am and sitting outside by myself drinking a cup of coffee while taking it all in - the pure serenity. So needed. So appreciated. So perfect.
Family time consisted of sitting in the dining room table playing Chicken Dominoes, hiking nearby trails, visiting Grenada Lake and just relaxing in the cabin. Spotty service with our cellphone carrier but that's what we were looking for! So needed. So appreciated. So perfect.
The pictures do not give this cabin justice.
Fair warning: make sure to wear your DEET! Doggo came back home with lots of ticks... welp. However, that just comes with the territory.
Can't wait to come back again!"

At night we watched bats and lighting bugs fly around the pond. Cabin is rustic and cozy and has everything you need for a laid back retreat. We enjoyed cooking our owns meals during our stay and the kitchen had everything we needed. We also enjoyed walking the path behind the cabin down to the lake. Would stay again!

Definitely would stay again and recommend to anyone I know wanting to go stay in that area. The welcome basket with coffee and snacks was very nice as was the bin full of ice in the freezer that obviously was made in there own ice maker and left for us, very thoughtful!!"

Close to Lake Grenada & several boat launches within 5 minutes (Piney Woods the closest at 2 miles). The cabin has a well stocked kitchen to make meals if you choose. A small chest freezer to store your catch was a very nice amenity along with a full size washer & dryer. You can tell the owners tried to think of everything to enhance the guest experience. Very large parking area for boats & trucks. Dogwood Golf course & Hugh White State Park 2 minutes away. Town is only 6 miles away. Bait & tackle store provides shiners, minnows & and a place to buy your fishing license. Great water pressure & the A/C was fantastic. The cabin was very comfortable for my husband & I and our best friend. Though fishing was tough due to the recent change in lake water levels, the cabin was perfect for our stay. The owners were very accommodating and allowed an early check in. Don’t hesitate to book your stay today!"

When you go to the house at the Y you will go to the left and then when you get to the 2 cabins at the Y take the left and then you will go to the left again and come to a gravel road. After the first Y our GPS was confused! So hopefully this helps if your GPS does the same as ours! The home was very clean! The air conditioner worked amazing! Didn’t even have to have a fan! Cute little porch if you are a coffee drinker in the mornings, you will 100% enjoy the view!! We will definitely go again and stay!! The owners were very friendly and always responded if needed!"

Stayed with kids","Such a lovely place, such a lovely stay. We sat on the back porch every night and watched the fireflies come out while a whippoorwill sang. Inside the cabin was snug and soundless, and full of the comforting smell of natural cedar on the walls. The Goffs have two cabins positioned at just the perfect angle that even though there were guests at the other cabin, we really couldn’t see or hear each other. We had everything we needed and instructions were clear. Mattresses/bedding feels new and comfortable. Closets have plenty of space; kitchen layout provides plenty of counter space. Bathroom is charming, clean and comfortable. The Goffs were kind, helpful, responsive hosts. It was an absolute wonderful stay. In case you are coming to the lake to hunt or fish, there is an extra chest freezer for your needs as well as a cleaning-table out back. Such a thoughtfully and tastefully laid out cabin. Thank you, Goff family!"

Comfortable bed, large walk-in shower with great water pressure. The coffee, water, and bars were a very nice tough. Kristi’s cabin is perfect for a family of 4 or a couple’s getaway. It is close to walking trails and the lake. Kristi checked in with me a couple of times during my stay to see if I needed anything. A+ new Airbnb hosts! Welcome Kristi and Bill!"

Stayed one night","This cabin was the perfect stop for us as we traveled through to the gulf coast. It was clean, well stocked, and the location was excellent. We only used one bedroom but the bed was very comfortable. Plenty of blankets and throws. Note: The driveway is steep but we had no trouble with our truck. Sara came over after we arrived and reviewed how everything worked, which was appreciated. Very pup friendly! Thanks Sarah!"

Group trip","This cabin is located a short distance from Grenada and a short distance from my favorite boat ramp at Grenada Lake. The cabin is nicely appointed, not a real fancy place, but a nice place for a family gatering, as ours was, or would be a great stay for a hunting or fishing trip. We found it to be very clean and neat. The owner, Sarah, was very accomadating and hospitable. Overall, a very nice place to stay."

Stayed one night","My wife, two dogs and I had a wonderful overnight stay at Sarah’s cabin. We had been traveling across country, towing a trailer and specifically chose places along our route that had decent yard space and a safe place to park our vehicle.
The cabin itself was way more spacious than we expected with a large kitchen and dining area, cool for a very hot summer’s day and super comfortable all around. We immediately sunk into the couches on arrival and appreciated having a tub to soak in before bed. Speaking of beds, there are several to choose from and doors that close off each space for added privacy if you’re staying with a larger group.
Sarah herself was an excellent host, so warm, welcoming and inviting and the type of person that makes you feel like extended family. She stopped by to give us the low down on the cabin, places to take our dogs, where to grab dinner and even gave my wife tips on remote job opportunities, which was unexpected and greatly appreciated. Out of the many places we stayed across the US, this was definitely one of our favorites."

Just little things that you may have forgotten all made it a wonderful stay. Very peaceful and relaxing.

We were there for my sons baseball tournament and it was just minutes away. Between games we were able to come back “home” relax and cook/grill.
It was so cozy and comfortable.
Sitting on the front porch brought back many fond childhood memories of sitting on my grandparents front porch.
We can’t wait to come back.
You WILL NOT regret staying here and will want to stay again and again.

Stayed a few nights","To say the helped me in a “bind” is an understatement! They took me in as a very last minute reservation, even accommodated an early check-in! Lucky for me they had a last minute cancellation.
Incredibly beautiful location, that view from the patio and hammock is gorgeous. In home is extremely tidy and neat. The kitchen and bathroom incredibly well stocked. So thrilled I had to change my plans, and grateful they were able to accommodate. I absolutely hope to stay again when I visit family in the area.
Cannot say enough about this lovely listing and hosts!"

Stayed a few nights","My sister and I plan a trip like this every year and this was one of the best experiences we have ever had. The accommodations and location left nothing to be desired and the host, Theresa, did a wonderful job making us feel at home.
We rented the boat for two days and it was perfect! Very sturdy and the seats were comfortable. We caught close to 20 large mouth bass so, if you love to fish, this is the perfect spot for that as well.
Really cannot say enough nice things about it! If you are looking for the perfect private lake front cabin getaway that feels rustic yet comfortable, look no further!"

Only thing I would say as a caution to others with small littles is there are two stairwells on the main level if you have littles on the move. We managed with a 1 year old though and very thankful Boo allowed us to have her party here."

It does need a serious deep cleaning of the house both inside & outside (on the porch) since so many pictures, what knots, etc. but the main things like bathroom, bedroom, kitchen was clean. There were no closets to hang my clothes in. We loved the multiple porches to relax & cook out. Overall it was a blessing to us & the house itself is very unique. The indoor pool was so much fun!

It is secluded so you have a lot of privacy but still 10 minutes from Walmart. The stairs to the bottom floor of the pool are super cool circular stairs but are very narrow and made to be taken very slowly haha. Overall it was a great experience and we would love to come back. I have had so many people contacting me asking about the place because of my pictures on Facebook. Also the decorations are such a great aesthetic.
WARNING: DO NOT GET IN THE SAUNA WET. That was not made very clear since the instructions are in it and are really small. We we're not aware it was a dry sauna only and getting water in it is a big safety hazard."

The home with set up very nicely with instrument and musical details. We had brought things from home; however, Boo had the house furnished with everything we could have needed. Even though Granada really only has the lake, we were able to still have fun with the pool, sauna, and board games on our rainy trip. Sunday morning we woke up, picked up, packed our things, and locked up before leaving. Check out was super easy! Boo was feeding his dogs at his shop. So, we were able to meet him and tell him thank you for the stay!"

The property is well used.
Ranging over a number of floors, it has some quirky architectural features such as a windowless indoor window in the upstairs bathroom overlooking the 'jacuzzi' (which we couldn't get to work).
The beds were clean and comfy. Nice fluffy clean towels and clean bathrooms.
The kitchen could have been a little cleaner.
If you're attracted to using the pool, perhaps ask the owner to ensure it is clean before you arrive. If you plane to use the sauna/steam room, make sure you ask for instructions on check in."

Stayed one night","Boo Corbett's place in Grenada is one of a kind. Beautiful views of the hilltops of northern Mississippi, great decks, a wrap around porch with a swing, & unique amenities like an indoor pool & sauna in the downstairs apartment. The place was very peaceful, & Boo's two gentle, docile dogs made my Mom lonesome for her own back home. Boo met us, gave us an orientation to the place & its history. Next time we'd have him cook for us, as his photo catalog of his meals he has served make it obvious after his career as a chef cooking is still a passion and gift. (And the best restaurant in town was likely a few stars lose than what we saw in Boo's photo album.) Great, rustic place, peaceful, all the amenities plus some. Thanks Boo."

Stayed over a week","We stayed here for nearly two months for work. If not for this place we never would have been able to complete the project! We needed a comfortable, nice place to stay that could accommodate our dogs, and Boo was such a great host and one of the nicest people we've ever met! Over such a long stay I was surprised that not once did he ever seem to get tired of us or our dogs who can be a little annoying at times. He even barbecued a couple times and made some really awesome food!
The place itself is awesome, plenty of room to relax indoors and out, great patios, fully stocked kitchen, and super comfortable bed. Also, you can't beat the indoor pool! It really was like a home away from home.
I can't recommend this place highly enough, Boo is a great and friendly host, the house was awesome, we had a great time."

Stayed with kids","My family and I attended a concert in Oxford, MS this past weekend and decided to stay somewhere more relaxing so we chose to stay at Mr. Donnie's place in Grenada. It was absolutely gorgeous and we loved every minute we were there. It definitely exceeded expectations! We are already looking forward to visiting again!"

Group trip","Donnie is absolutely the best host I've had on Air BnB. Easy to deal with, nice guy, and Top Tier hospitality! I would highly suggest this house for every user on this app."
