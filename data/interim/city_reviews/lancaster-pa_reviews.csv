Stayed one night","We cannot say enough great things about this cozy little gem in the country! Ruby was instantly welcoming in her online responses and gave us privacy during our time at her place. So many simple, but thoughtful extras to welcome us... fresh apples on the kitchen table, snacks & water in the kitchenette, and bath necessities (soap, shampoo & conditioner, a first aid kit too!). The clip-clop of the Amish neighbors traveling up and down the road was especially sweet! We only stayed one night this time, so we didn't get to spend much time in the beautiful outdoor spaces she's created, but we'll definitely be back! Thank you, Ruby! :)"

Stayed one night","My boyfriend and I booked Ruby’s place to get out of NJ for a night. We had the best time ever. This spot is definitely a hidden gem and we will be back. We travel a lot and we have had some bad pillows, showers, and beds, but not here. Honestly I slept better here than at home and so did my boyfriend. SO comfortable. SO clean. Such friendly, welcoming and inviting hosts. Ruby, John and Bravo (their sweet pup who loves to run around and be happy) have the best spot with the best location. Five plus stars if you are hesitant on booking read my review and book it because you will have the best, relaxing time."

The Wash House has the charm of the old on the outside but renovated and modernized inside. l loved the outdoor seating and the water feature plus a cute bird feeder just outside our window so we could sit still and watch. The bed was very comfortable. We hope to come back.

Ruby's communication was clear, helpful, and timely. The only negative was a bit of cold draft through the rustic door and windows with the December wind, but the heating unit was able to keep up. Would recommend, especially in warmer months when the draft wouldn't matter and the outside patio and fire pit would be more attractive."

Stayed a few nights","I absolutely loved my stay at Ruby’s place! It was a wonderful weekend, hugely due to how cute, cozy, and quaint the property is. I visited in December so the place was decorated with its own Christmas tree and Christmasy bedding - a lovely touch!This place is the perfect size for two people and the space is so well arranged that it feels bigger than it probably is in terms of square feet. The surrounding spaces within the property are great too! There’s a private deck on the backside of the Olde Wash House, fire pit area, and gazebo.
Ruby was a joy and went above and beyond to make my friend and I feel welcome. This is the best Airbnb experience I’ve ever had and highly recommend staying here!"

She knew of this and made sure there was an ottomon in the room for me to put my feet up. She was very friendly and hospitable giving recommendatiins for two weary travelers our first night. The olde wash home is charming clean and surrounded by beautiful amish farm land. And to the very end I realized I left something behind. And Ruby shipped it out to me the next day. Ruby is by far an airbnb superhost. You must book this cute little cottage in your next travels to Lancaster.

The best part is being able to sit outside and watch the sunset and the horses. We were lucky enough to meet Ruby and John and they are the most gracious hosts.
I highly recommend The Olde Wash House. You will love every moment there. We'll be back next year!"

I can't say enough about the lovely little house and all of its personal touch! Ruby has it decorated so nicely. She had snacks, fresh fruit, and water in the fridge. Everything was spotless! The bed was so comfortable, and we slept very well. I wish my mattress at home was as comfy as Ruby's!
Ruby and her husband John are both so friendly too! Their kindness comes straight from the heart, and you can tell that they're so sincere. I honestly have to say that I have never seen two people work so hard, and so continuous in my life! They never stop!
I don't want to omit the lovely yard and grounds, and their Amish neighbors! It was delightful to watch them doing their daily chores. I was truly inspired. I'm running out of space, but I must mention Bravo, their Beautiful Dog! LOVE!"

Stayed one night","Ruby & John were incredibly warm and welcoming - and so was their adorable two-year old dog, Bravo. Sweet Bravo greeted us as soon as we pulled into the driveway with his non-stop wagging tail & huge smile. He's very calm and well-behaved! My sister and I had a wonderful evening and overnight of peace, quiet, and pure rest & relaxation after a long, busy day of visiting friends and family in Wilmington. The Olde Wash House was sooooo comfy!!! It's nestled on John & Ruby's large property of gorgeous trees, shrubs, & blooming flowers. There are many spots here and there to relax outdoors. I enjoyed a cold beer on the west-facing deck behind the Olde Wash House as the sun set behind a huge barn next door. The farm across the road had two or three roan (is that ""blonde"" in horse talk?) horses joyously frolicking in their pasture. The only sound was from merry birds fluttering from tree to tree and the occasional clip-clopping of horses hooves as Amish buggies ambled by. HEAVEN!!"

Ruby & John have created a perfectly landscaped ""welcome"" to Lancaster County. The Olde Wash House is nestled amongst shade trees, perennial gardens, twinkling lights and historic farm houses. The private entry is lovely and the accommodations fabulous! The rooms are decorated beautifully, the bed - so comfortable, the fixtures all new and fit the space well. It really is a charming mix of old & new.
We woke each morning to cows and horses grazing in the fields nearby, and Amish children making their way to school, all while horses & buggies took families down the road. It was peaceful, lovely, and more than we had hoped for.
Ruby & John are thoughtful and kind hosts. It was a pleasure to meet them. We are so grateful for their hospitality and look forward another stay."

It was neat to watch the buggies drive by and hear the clicking of the horses at night. The farm next door had some cows come along the fence line that came over for a visit.

Stayed a few nights","Seeing this place in person exceeded my expectations. The decor, the thoughtfulness behind certain details/accommodations just gave you this “feel at home” kind of vibe.
Kitchen was well stocked with equipment if you’re staying for a longer visit. While it was my first time in Pennsylvania, appreciated the maps and brochures left on the front table. Bed was super comfy and there was plenty of storage space for my clothes in the closet nearby. Ceiling fan above the bed was a surprise but a nice touch for I’m sure the hotter days. Bathroom was clean, and the added sanitary napkin dispenser on the wall is a smart idea. If I had to be picky, not a lot of counter top space in the bathroom so ladies that wear a lot of makeup or who have a lot of skin care products, just an fyi.
Can’t forget about having a private garage in the city was a bonus! Walking distance to plenty of restaurants and shops. Felt safe; neighborhood was quiet.
Overall, would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","Julia's barn air BNB was incredible. It had everything we needed for a perfect weekend away. Everything was incredibly clean, aesthetic, and fostered relaxation and rest. Even though it snowed, they kept the walks clear of snow and ice. Plus, the large window afforded breathtaking views of the falling snow all through the afternoon and evening.
We parked once and didn't have to drive anywhere-- everything was within walking distance. We were just a few blocks from Root and Rachels, two must have stops for bites to eat.
We can't wait to return."

Stayed a few nights","If I could give a more then 5 star review I would, first off I would like to say it’s the cutest place I’ve ever been to, we lived 4.5 hours away so we left early on the morning and hit the market as soon as we got there, it was super fun to visit and got some great food. We then proceeded to walk around and explore before heading to Julia’s place. It is down a small side street which was no problem for us our car fit perfectly fine. And parking in the garage was amazing we fit great. I loved the fact they offered a washer and dryer. It came in handy when we got soaked in the rain. The main living area is just big enough to including everything we need. It was so cozy to. She had everything you could think off. We were even able to cook a full meal. She even offered to walk over when we couldn’t figure out Netflix. Over all this was the most beautiful place we could’ve stayed at and will definitely be recommending it to everybody and maybe even come back next year for our holiday vaca!"

Overall a beautiful place to stay, the photos don't do it justice! I do warn that you may want to bring your smaller vehicle, the alley is very tight and we drove in our older dually truck... It did fit, but definitely takes a skilled driver to get a large vehicle in and out!

The space is comfortable and relaxing. Both of your properties (Little House on Mary and this property) are spot on for travelers. We surely will return!” Having seen the space myself and using AirBnB often for my own travels, this is one of the nicest I’ve ever seen with great design, great space, and a great location (and parking!)."

If you want the best of both worlds: the energy and excitement of the city by day and the quite and tranquility at night.....The Barn on Fox Alley is the place to stay."

John had plenty of seasoned firewood and starter there for the fireplace. It helped to crack the window a little until the flue gets hot when using the fireplace in order to keep smoke from coming back in cabin.
Even though you’re not far from other homes, the cabin felt decently private.
The cabin was clean all around. The bed was comfortable, and the hot tub was a nice bonus.
I’d definitely recommend John’s place to others."

Stayed one night","John's log cabin was truly awesome. From the excellent communication to the easy check-in to the beautiful interior, everything was perfect. Set back off the road for privacy but an easy drive to all the area attractions, the cabin feels like you are stepping back in time but with all the modern goodies (including an amazing coffee maker). The hot tub is incredible, and the fireplace is great for amping up the cozy factor (John even supplies the firewood). All in all, a wonderful stay and can't wait to return."

Stayed one night","Mostly, stay was nice. Home charming, surprisingly spacious (walls angled-obviously. Careful upstairs if you’re tall). Beds comfy. Key lockbox & parking easy. Nice white towels. Hosts fast to respond to messages re: planning what to bring (coffee/creamer/etc). SURPRISES-strong mildew odor upon entry. I got used to it fairly quickly. If you have an allergy, you should know. I later saw other reviews mentioned it too.
Also framed signs re: rules, procedures. One says no food/drink in living areas. If you like coffee in bed or a drink on the couch to watch tv, it’s a no-no.
Bold, though, is the sign of check out rules-not included on listing. Despite the $75 cleaning fee, guests are TOLD (not asked, no please) to take trash to the outside bin, wash/dry/put away dishes, strip beds, reset thermostats.
I am respectful of others’ property. I tidy up when leaving. But I never experienced this as an Airbnb guest or a guest anywhere. Pretty nervy of ppl profiting from a hospitality service."

quiet neighborhood with nice privacy. Home is comfortable and had everything we needed. Our stay was a short 3 day visit . Main reason for our visit was sight and sound theater production of Daniel, which was excellent. Theater is very short drive away. In our brief visit we enjoyed a country drive ,shady maple smorgasbord, Tuesday farmers market, bird in hand bakery,and some relaxation.
Looking foward to a visit in the future."

That being said we were able to get a partial refund but more than that even, they were so kind and communicative leading up to and after receiving our news of cancelling a mere hour or two before check-in. We fully intend to book this listing again in the future when things have settled down for us. I would recommend this listing/host 10 out of 10 times just based on their warm and helpful service over the phone and especially how thoughtful/sincere they were with us after learning of our loss.

Stayed a few nights","This little A frame has a lot going for it with the location, quiet area, and style, but unfortunately, the VERY strong smell of mildew really made my stay not fun. I could smell it on my hair and clothes when I wasn't there and when I got home it took three hair washings to get the smell out. My suitcase, clothes, toiletry bag, etc took more effort to get the smell out. Washing my clothes didn't even work after the first washing. I have put off giving a review, because I don't like to give negative reviews, but I need to tell others. I'm sure the owners have tried to get the smell out because a dehumidifier and air purifier was running constantly. I'm surprised no one else had complained about it until several months prior. 🤔 Sorry, but I could not recommend this place to anyone unless this was resolved."

It’s in such a great location, and absolutely adorable! Nathan and Becky styled this A-frame so well, and it manicured inside and out! The landscape is beautiful, and decor is fantastic! It is kept immaculately, and our stay here was outstanding! Thank you!"

Stayed a few nights","The home was very nicely decorated, but reeks of mold. Instructions for check out said to wash/put away dishes, but no sponge to wash. They were very responsive when I reached out about mold smell and sponge. They offered to refund us if we wanted to leave, but we were only there for two nights. They also told us to leave any dishes in the sink for the cleaners. I feel like they knew about the smell since there were two dehumidifiers already set up. They did not help and were very noisy. Also, there was Christian literature everywhere."

Stayed with kids","We really enjoyed our stay in the A-frame. We have never been inside one, and my daughter thought it was amazing! She loved the loft area and spiral stairs. Everything was clean and so nicely decorated. We enjoyed making breakfast, watching Christmas movies, and sitting in the lounge areas hanging out. The bedroom was very spacious. The location was close to many things we enjoyed. The owners were super responsive.
A few issues/suggestions:
-There was a musty smell on entry but we either got used to it or the dehumidifier took care of it.
-The house felt drafty in some areas so socks or slippers are a good idea for guests to bring.
-I felt that over $100 in fees at the end of checking out was very excessive. I had spent a lot of time researching places and comparing prices and settled on this one. It ended up being TWICE as much as the listing advertised. I was so tired of searching by that point that I booked it anyways, but those cleaning fees should just be included in the cost."

Stayed with kids","This a really cute place in a great location, with lots of nice amenities like a fire pit and grill. About seven minutes to Dutch Wonderland, which is great when your kids need a nap break in the middle of the day. And easy access to downtown Lancaster and other attractions in the area.
The master bedroom is modern and large, complementing an upstairs loft. Given the design of the house, the loft room gets a lot of light in the morning when the sun comes up. So if you’re sensitive to light, the master bedroom downstairs is better for shutting out light. The kitchen is sensibly stocked with the essentials, though it doesn’t have more specialized items like muffin pans (we ended up making muffins in a casserole dish). The washer/dryer is very handy, as were the dehumidifier and extra air conditioning (it was 90+ every day we were there). We would definitely stay again!"

We tried turning down the AC to 60 and it did not work effectively. The couple nights me and my wife stayed we did not get very good rest unfortunately, but it was still a very nice place to stay aside from this and we enjoyed the time we spent during the day! I assume this would be a perfect location in the fall and spring."

All of the main attractions are 10-25 minutes away. Tanger outlets are literally 4 minutes away. Hershey park 35-45 mins away. Downtown is close. Its in a great, well off neighborhood. Seems like it’s not alot of crime in the area at all. Had extra toilet paper and trash bags easily accessible. Lots of towels and wash cloths. Pans, and dishes and appliances readily available. Very clean house. The bed room upstairs may be hard to get to if it’s an older person, or heavy set person. Upstairs probably better for children.

Stayed one night","I was absolutely delighted to return to Martha's for the second time, and I must say, this charming residence truly feels like a home away from home. Its prime location, just a 5-minute stroll from school, makes it an ideal haven for students seeking convenience and comfort. Plus, a bowling alley with a restaurant serving exquisite sangria is just around the corner, providing the perfect spot to unwind with friends. And, if you're fortunate, you'll be greeted by the welcoming committee: a playful and affectionate puppy who loves attention and playtime. This cozy retreat offers everything you need to feel relaxed and at ease, complete with soft linens, plush furnishings, and a well-equipped kitchen that makes cooking a breeze. During our stay, we took full advantage of the beautiful weather and spent some quality time lounging in the patio chairs, soaking up the sun. I've already booked my next stay in a couple of weeks and am eager to make use of the grill and enjoy soaking in the sun!"

Stayed with a pet","I can think of only two items I'd add, if I were making suggestions. I'd add more, but I can't, because Martha's cottage had everything else we needed!
For a smaller cottage, the space was laid out to make use of just about every inch, so it didn't have a small-space feel to it. It was the perfect space for my husband and I to get a much needed break. We both slept like babies in the cozy bed, did NOT want to get out of the FABULOUS shower (I almost made us late checking out because it felt so good), and rather than eat in the living room to watch tv, we just turned it a little and it was perfect for viewing while we enjoyed our dinner at the kitchen counter.
Probably the only down-side was that it was chilly and windy, so it wasn't the best weather to walk across their foot bridge and sit by the stream. We're very much looking forward to another stay so we can do that, as well as enjoying cooking outside on the grill. Loved this place!"

The outside space had a small deck that was nice for sitting and a grill if you needed to grill! The road is busy and can be loud at night at times, but it wasn't a deal breaker and the host's fault.

Stayed one night","It was good for what we needed and better than a hotel. Martha made sure there was a iron at the location after I asked which was great. Few thing off- like the handheld show spout (which we are pretty sure was broken) didn’t work, the bed was below average in comfort, the whole place was cooled by a single window ac unit and no fans, and both my wife and me woke up with scratching throats and runny noses like our allergies were irritated. The only other complaint we had was there was no full length mirror which when you are in town for a wedding is a small thing worth noting. It was overall really clean, the back deck was a nice touch and I would definitely stay there again over a hotel especially at the price."

Stayed with a pet","Martha’s place was the perfect getaway for our first family vacation! Our toddler loved walking around from room to room and snuggling on the couch, and our dog loved roaming for bunnies in the backyard. He even took a quick dip in the creek!
The kitchen was perfect to prepare quick meals in when we didn’t feel like going out, as well as to just sit at the bar and enjoy some snacks!
My husband and I really enjoyed sitting outside on the deck in the evening, sharing in a little quiet and relaxation. The string lights set the best mood!
This was a cozy home away from home. Would recommend to anyone looking to getaway for a few days!"

Stayed with a pet","Martha’s place was absolutely wonderful! It was the perfect landing pad for my crew in the middle of a long road trip. The house was spotless and well appointed. Martha was very responsive to any requests. Being pet-friendly was a huge bonus to us— we brought a long 50 foot leash for our dog and he loved romping around in the field behind the creek after a day in the car. Lancaster is wonderful- highly recommend the downtown area, tons of restaurants and shops, and a very nice dog park as well. My only note just to be aware of us that there is no AC unit in the bedroom (it’s in the main living area), which is totally fine if you keep the door open at night. If you close the door, however, the room gets a little stuffy. We would absolutely stay again!"

All looked the same as in the photos, so pretty, new looking, and spotless. The bed was very comfortable and the shower just perfect. We enjoyed our morning coffee on the little deck out back and even took a walk across their small bridge to check it out. My husband and I felt right at home in this cottage and are happy we found a place we can book for future visits to Lancaster. Oh...did I mention that they are in a great location too?

Martha was very responsive and provided clear instructions before check-in and check-out. The place was very clean and had everything we needed. We were there for less than 24 hours as it was a really quick trip, but we enjoyed our stay. We were even greeted walking out our door in the morning by their absolutely adorable pup. She made our morning...she's the sweetest and friendliest little thing! We only crossed paths briefly with Martha and her husband while leaving and they were very kind."

Stayed a few nights","I was able to find a place to park a couple doors up from the property so that was a great start. The street is busy but the Matilda suite is on the backside of the building and aside from a very occasional ambulance (due to the proximity of the property), it was extremely quiet and peaceful. There is an abundance of natural light from morning to sunset which was absolutely therapeutic. It is roughly a half mile walk to the Central Market, I didn't plan well and there were so many options, so carrying my goods back was a bit of a bear so if you plan to go to the market, bring a back back or cart - it will make things easier. The kitchen had exactly what I needed to make meals and they left some farm fresh eggs and a couple of micro brews as an added treat. Great coffee shops and unique retail shops were an easy 10-20 minute walk depending on where you want to go. The Belvedere Inn was about around the corner and had delicious food and drinks with friendly bartenders. I'll be back!"

Other than that we had a great stay, it was a clean and cozy place! We did end up staying on a night when they were doing street cleaning so we had to park on lime street, it was an okay walk.

This listing is everything it looks to be and more. Before travelling, our expectations were set high based on the description and the photos that are provided - but wow were they ever exceeded.
The location proved to be optimal during our stay as well. We were walking distance from most shops / restaurants that we planned to enjoy, and had no issues finding parking when we needed to drive. A few highlights from our trip were Decades for games / dinner, Sight and Sound theatres, Taylor Chip Cookies, and Landis Family Farm for some fresh cut flowers.
We are confident that this listing will exceed your expectations as well, and serve you wonderfully throughout your stay. It is very clear that the hosts have put significant time and energy into making every aspect of this stay intentional and relaxing."

Stayed a few nights","What a delightful property! The original architecture is amazing (I’m in love with the stairs). Shannon and Rich have created a quiet and cozy getaway that I would recommend in a heartbeat to friends & family.
As others mentioned, there were lots of thoughtful touches, from the bathrobes to the two local beers & small container of eggs in the fridge. It was nice and cool (central AC for the win!) and I loved all of the natural light through the windows. While I didn’t use it, the fact that there was laundry in the basement was huge plus. Everything was incredibly clean, the bed was very comfortable, and the shower is truly the BEST. Seriously.
Shannon & Rich are very responsive, friendly, and helpful (and the welcome guide they created was fantastic!). You can tell they’ve put a lot of time and care into their properties, and I’m very excited to come back and stay again sometime.
Also, I grew up in the country and have lived in many cities (including Lancaster) and this was one of the quietest places I’ve stayed in. There were maybe a few times I heard a car, but it was very rare! I was so happy to come back after a busy day and be in complete silence.
Don’t miss out on this stay—it will be one of your favorites!"

Stayed a few nights","Rich and Shannon have done an absolutely stunning job restoring this old Victorian home. It is conveniently located on Duke Street, one of the main thoroughfares of the city, and this unit is located in the back of the home away from any street noise, and surrounded by greenery. Quick 10 minute walk to Lemon Street Market for groceries, or to other shops in downtown. The balcony is lovely for having morning coffee and breakfast, or an evening meal. The interior is spotlessly clean (I am a tough judge of cleanliness), with all the comforts of home provided and then some! There are so many thoughtful touches (well tended to plants, extra blankets, plush robes, etc.) that truly made our stay more than just another airbnb. The shower head/water pressure is amazing and spa-like. Check-in was easy, and communication with Rich and Shannon was always timely and helpful. For parking, another review suggested trying over by the nearby cemetery, and this worked perfectly for us as well (no permit required, and no time limit). I would without hesitation recommend"

Stayed a few nights","Staying at the Fahnestock House was absolutely lovely! My boyfriend and I rented this space for a little romantic getaway, and it was perfect. The private balcony, bathrobes, and other little touches made this stay exactly what we were looking for. It was also a great location - Rich and Shannon provided a lovely little guidebook showing off all the local hot spots within walking distance to help make our stay in Lancaster really easy to plan. The best part is that all of this came with an affordable price tag, which you don't see often in AirBnB's. This place is truly a gem and I would definitely book here again!"

Rich and Shannon offered a very clean and well put together place that we'd highly recommend if your looking for a place to stay in Lancaster, Pa. The Matilda is in a perfect location to walk to many attractions and points of interest in the area. We found our stay there very peaceful and quiet. The building itself is full of charm, while The Matilda has a way of making you feel like you're walking into your home. If you're looking for a long weekend stay or even longer, we highly recommend you giving The Matilda a try."

Stayed one night","We had a great stay at Rich and Shannon's place. We were just stopping through for one night, at the last minute, and they were vey accommodating! The space was drenched in light, which was very enjoyable, especially during this winter when we are forced to spend way more time indoors. The kitchen is well-equipped, with dishwasher and everything you need to prepare simple meals at home. There is only one TV, in the bedroom, but this was fine for us as we just watched it for a bit before bed. The apartment is in a wonderful location, right in the downtown. There's an organic grocery store a few blocks away to pick up whatever you may need food-wise, and an adorable Swedish candy shop right around the corner. Most things were not open, because it was a Sunday and of course, Covid, but we still enjoyed wandering around the cute town. Parking is a bit complicated, as much of the street parking requires a permit, so make sure to read the instructions provided by Rich and Shannon for where/when you can park safely to avoid getting ticketed. You could hear the other people in the building above you and when guests were coming up or down the stairs, but it was very quiet at night. Overall, we had a great stay and would stay again."

Stayed over a week","It's a beautiful apartment and the hosts are super great but... it has a couple of things that
we didn't like. First of all since it's on a second floor we were told that we may be able to hear footsteps above us, but that was far from true. Not only you can listen to everything other guests do above you, but we had people walking with heels and even 2 kids jumping up and down and galloping above our bedroom when we were trying to sleep. it's not the hosts fault, but I did find this kind of disappointing considering we asked them about the noise. Second thing is since it's located in the city, you can hear cars.That wouldn't be terrible if only people didn't blast their speakers all the time. And there's (Im guessing a neighbor?) a person that plays the LOUDEST music at 8:30 am every.single.day. we stayed for 14 days and that was enough, because it's super super loud. so if you're Looking for an extremely quiet place, this is not it.
Apart from that, the place is cool. Stylish and comfortable, it just wasn't what we were expecting. Most of the problems are NOT the hosts fault, but it did kind of ruined the experience for us."

All furnitures were practically necessary and serving their purpose without taking space in vain. All the decors look blend in to the interior and were arrayed and arranged so well that the original architect if he were alive would’ve complimented Rich and Shannon for their quality renovation/decoration work as well. It was such memorable and comfortable stay that my family wants to visit this place every year to rest.

Stayed a few nights","The Matilda Flat is in a big old house that has all its original details. The ceilings are high and windows large, making the space feel nice and airy. The place is on the back of the building up a flight of stairs, so it’s nice and quiet. The kitchen and bath are recently updated, and the kitchen is fully equipped with pans, utensils, etc. Street parking was pretty easy, but for convenience I bought a week pass to the hospital parking garage around the corner (be aware that it closes at 8pm). Rich and Shannon provided a very thorough guide to the house and the city. Note: If you are physically challenged, you might have difficulty with the building’s beautiful but VERY heavy front door. All in all, a pleasant stay."

Stayed over a week","We had a wonderful stay and would love to give the Matilda flat 10+ stars if we could. The high ceilings and natural light that came from the windows enabled us to relax and take in the peacefulness of Lancaster. The location was amazing - there was a lot you can walk to and when it was too hot to stroll, it was easy to find parking and take off in your car 5 minutes away to the shopping areas and mainstream restaurants. We were 10 min walking distance to Central Market and would often duck out during lunch hours (since we went here to just have a quick getaway from the city!) and pick up local coffee, fresh bread, and lunch meals to take back to the apartment. Rich + Shannon's recommendations outside of the area were also spot on. We had a great time driving to Lancaster's Central Park + enjoyed Pine View Dairy for fresh goods off the farm. Everything was neat, tidy, and thoughtful and Rich + Shannon were always extremely responsive - we're looking forward to another opportunity to stay here again and can't thank the hosts enough for making this such a warm and welcoming experience."

The back dining/living room had windows on three sides and we were worried that it might be cold in February. However, the heater worked perfectly and we were warm throughout - especially when the sun shone in. The kitchen was very new, functional and everything worked. The queen bed was comfortable and the bedroom very quiet. The bedroom had artistic finishes, gloriously high-ceilings and architectural surprises that made it fun. Shower was powerful and there was a luxurious sink in the bathroom. This apartment does have five stairs leading from the bedroom area to the bathroom floor and then the kitchen so one has to be careful. It was a delightful place to stay - a great experience. We hope to be back!"

The soap in the shower is Devine, as is the amazingly comfortable bed. I'm stayed here while moving to Lancaster and this location was walkable to the main restaurants and tourist spots even at below zero. The back apartment I was in was so quiet I felt bad ruining the peace with my sneezes! My friend stayed one night and found the pull out to be more comfortable then her own home. I have no feedback other than be nice and water the plants for the owners when you stay!

Check in is very easy. Shannon is kind, professional and very responsive.
The home was sparkling clean and spacious. The shower and bathroom were great too. The bed was “to die for” comfortable, I loved it and slept well.
The little things matter so much, Rich and Shannon’s binder of Lancaster recommendations is pure gold!!! Because of their recs, I took my colleagues to the Belvedere Inn and Luca for dinner, both hits! I also got takeout at Sa La Thai and saw a documentary at the funky Zoetropolis. Their recs filled my whole trip and I didn’t even get to go to the Axe Throwing bar (!!) and the Lord of the Rings coffee and book shop (!). Pro Tip: Read their binder :)
Rich and Shannon have also put loads of fun books all over the apartment, books that are actually fun to pick up and read for a bit. I read many thoughtful interviews with famous women and enjoyed flipping through 1000 places to see before you die ;)
If you need a nice, quiet, comfortable apartment during your stay in Lancaster, you cannot go wrong with the Matilda apartment. You’ll have a peaceful happy stay with tons of fun places all within walking distance.
Thank you Rich and Shannon!"

It's a few blocks from many antique stores. We walked to the Lancaster Central Market Saturday morning. We enjoyed a dinner at Luca. We were able to walked everywhere from the apartment. The apartment was clean and the bed was very comfortable. We would gladly stay there again.

The space is so convenient to anything you would want to do in downtown Lancaster which is a very walkable city. We found walking south on Duke St being the nicest walking route to most locations. Plan to park your car and explore. The space is huge, very comfortable and inviting!"

Every restaurant we went to had fantastic food, great service and very good prices. The shops were beautiful and welcoming.
However, the house was the best part. The decor is beautiful! We had everything we needed and easily relaxed in the luxurious surroundings. It's going to be very difficult to find a nicer home for next year. We should probably just stay at Renew, again! Thank you, so much, Sarah!"

It's the perfect spot for families or couples for a weekend getaway and everything you hope an Airbnb experience will be: clean, feels like a vacation, has all the amenities and has a host that truly wants you to have a good stay.
10/10!! You'd be crazy not to book!"

Stayed a few nights","The host did amazing job and the cleaning crew did great! The decore was gorgeous and the remodeling of this place has a boho vibe. The location was great overall. There is a parking garage in the back not far from the property but parking out front was no issue. As morning hits you may get woken up by dump trucks or traffic. The master bed has a slight dip in it but it was comfortable. Both larger beds were comfy. The showers has great water pressure and plenty of towels. The main thing that I Would suggest for people who are effected by the heat (like MS or other diseases) be sure to bring extra fans. There is one fan at the house. There are air conditioner units. However, we turned them too 64 and it was still rough. The fan and cooler air at night did help. Master bedroom is on the top floor and harder to cool. Just FYI. otherwise, everything was amazing. I would stay here again and suggest cooler air upstairs and maybe at some point...do decor outback. That would be super cute."

Parking is easy. I was always able to find a spot on the same block as the apartment so I never had to park in the lot.
The smart TV's had all of the popular streaming services installed. I just had to log in and I was able to watch all of my shows, just as if I were at home.
There were plenty of lights and light switches in the home, which is important to me.
I had a great and comfortable time and would definitely stay here again."

We had 6 guests and were all very comfortable with the amount of space. The parking garage was very easy to find and a quick walk away. One thing to note is the stairs are quite steep and a bit slippery to go down, myself and another guest both slipped on them even while holding the railing. It would be helpful if there were some grippers on them. Otherwise everything is absolutely wonderful! Would definitely stay again if visiting the area!"

Stayed one night","You can tell when the hosts are really thoughtful, & this is one of those places. Everything is newly renovated–as nice as a 100+ year old space can be. Street pkg is limited to 2 hrs, but not metered. So u just need to find a spot, which we did within a block or 2 each time. If pkg for > 2 hrs during biz hrs, use the nearby garage or move your car. We just parked on the street. For unloading, we briefly “created” a spot out front, out of the way of traffic, so no one cared. Regarding the stairs, we were a bit concerned by other reviews. But they were “fine”. Would I recommend them to someone with bad knees? No. Were they ok for a couple of days? Yes. Each stair is a little taller, and a little less deep, than a modern stair step, especially to the top floor. We wanted multiple bedrooms and bathrooms, a full kitchen, and a full table, and this place had all those. We had 1 little problem w/ the heat & the host was very responsive, which is all you can ask for. Definitely recommend!!"

Sarah was great with communication, and there were lots of helpful tip lists throughout the house, which was appreciated.
Our only complaints were the road noise at all hours of the night- motorcycles and loud cars revving, and garbage trucks at 5am. If you’re used to living in a city, I imagine it may not be a problem. A sound machine also helped tremendously. We stayed at a place just a street over a few years ago and had no problem with street noise, so perhaps it’s a temporary issue.
We didn’t realize there was no off-street parking, which was a bit inconvenient with three young kids. However, you can occasionally snag a spot out front, or on the side, which is metered. Otherwise the parking garage is super close and it wasn’t a huge issue!"

Group trip","We really enjoyed our stay. We were in town for our daughter’s graduation from F&M. The house is lovely, and the location can’t be beat. We had three people 75+ in age in our group, and we worried about the stairs in this place, particularly since there are no bathrooms on the first floor and all the bedrooms are upstairs. But they did fine with the steep stairs. We helped them, and they took it slow. Overall, this place is wonderful. I’d just be careful with older parents/grandparents that are staying here. But like I said, we managed. We were very happy with our stay."

Only negatives - 1. it's a renovated old row home so the stairs are narrow and steep, bot a big deal but just need to be careful not to trip. 2. No driveway and street parking is permit only, but there is a parking garage very close. For a location in the center of downtown, you can't beat it!"

Stayed a few nights","I found Stephanie's listing while wedding planning since I was getting married at the Barn at Silverstone and I'm so happy I did. There is ample parking for us to have a few cars to load/unload our belongings and prepare for the big say. Stephanie was responsive and proactive before our visit. Not only was she so welcoming and helpful, she keeps a beautiful home and the level of cleanliness is up to my standards. The bed was comfortable, the linens were smooth and clean, the space smelled fresh and fragrant, the AC was on yet well insulated & the amentities were updated. The roomes were dust free and had no odor or mold, which is something I find in airbnbs. It had all of the things I needed to prepare a snack or drink coffee, even providing a whoopie pie for us! The design is also calming and stylish, without being over the top. It felt right at home to refresh myself and have quiet time with my husband amidst the busy weekend. If I want a Lancaster getaway, Stephanie's will be my go!"

The thoughtfulness in having everything ready for her guests is incredible, including detailed kitchen instructions and luggage racks. The location is fantastic. The backyard setup is cute, too. Although we were familiar with the Bird-in-Hand and Strasburg areas, it was great to be able to ask for recommendations for Lancaster City.

I prefer an Airbnb over a hotel and places like this beautiful spot are why. This location is perfect to get to many local attractions. Bird in Hand is literally just down the road and you are also close to many restaurants. The home is perfection. I told my mom is was like a Chip and Joanna type home with all the lovely details, they even left a whoopie pie to snack on. Everything was clean and super comfy. I felt very at home and relaxed. As a busy nurse practitioner I needed this atmosphere. I could even often hear the clip clop of horse and buggies go by and see them from the bedroom window. The owners are super receptive and answer questions quickly, always wonderful!! Another 5/5 location found and when I return I will stay again."

Although it is on a somewhat busy street it is still very quiet. It is in a nice residential neighborhood, and I was able to safely exercise outside. The private back porch was an especially nice place to enjoy my cup of coffee in the morning. The porch included a view of an Amish home and farm.

Apart from the exquisite and cosy house, David was a great host and so was Jim! Jim came over to help right away when I had a request. He made us feel extra special when he came over one morning with a box of strawberries. I've stayed in many Airbnbs in the past but this was the best experience yet. Thank you, David and Jim!"
