It also had the amenities listed and was very clean. The owner also was flexible when I needed to add a tool for a co-worker from work . Location was near highway so easy to get around town .

The Casita is recently updated with charming touches and thoughtful amenities that made my stay very comfortable. The location is quiet and peaceful and yet just a few minutes away from the NMSU campus and many shops and restaurants in the surrounding area.

My mother and sister flew in for the weekend and we had an AMAZING time together at the L.H McCombs winery and bistro and then later that night in the hot tub!! We unfortunately didn’t get a chance to use the fireplace, but hopefully next time. 😊"

Stayed a few nights","The place was exactly as advertised - so beautiful and spacious! Michael was a fantastic and very kind host. The only issue we had was with a very large number of cockroaches both outside and inside. Michael handled this as well as he possibly could have and sent someone to spray immediately. This did result in many dead roaches but we found ourselves then cleaning them up and avoiding the backyard for the rest of the stay as there were still some crawling around. The backyard was the main selling point for us so we were disappointed when we didn't end up wanting to be out there with the bugs. I don't think Michael could have handled this any differently / better, he was great! Just unfortunate luck."

Stayed with a pet","Place is super convenient and close to everything. We felt safe and had no issues with the location. When we went to check-in at 3:45(check-in is at 3), the cleaners were still inside cleaning and said they wouldn’t be done for another 30 minutes. We had driven 9 hours with our dogs and child so this was super inconvenient and unacceptable. I immediately wrote the host and he basically said it’s part of their cleaning and turnover process? What? No. We had to drive around to kill time and when we returned the cleaners left. When they left, they left chairs and barstools all up on the tables and you could definitely tell it had been rushed. I would have been happier if the host had been apologetic but to just brush it off isn’t the way to go."

Stayed with kids","Terrible host and ammenneties experience. We specifically chose this place over others due to the fact that it had a jacuzzi and it was close to Highway. Upon arrival, we noticed that the jacuzzi was extremely dirty and unusable. I wrote the host and sent him pictures.The host replied that it was something that the previous guest did, and since I had such a great deal with the price of his place,it is something that I should deal with and not use it. When I pointed out that the reason why we pay a cleaning fee to book the place is to make sure that we use all the ammenneties. The host got upset and told me to leave. To not be an a-høle and a cry baby. We were traveling with my kids and pulling a moving trailer. Our goal was to put the kids to bed,enjoy the jacuzzi, and rest a few hours to continue with our drive. The host just brushed out the problem,said it was too bad,clean it myself,and said he didn't care who I was.Spoke with Airbnb,and they immediately apologized for his behavior"

Group trip","Hello,
We were so disappointed with this place. Many things in the house didn't work or were damaged to the point one of the bedroom alarm smoke detectors was missing and we have an issue with the smoke alarm going off on us several times making it impossible to be at the house. Luckily wasn't any fire. We couldn't have a good night's sleep due to the poor quality of the bedroom mattresses. AC never reached the temperature that was set up. It was really HOT! and unfortunately hostess never responded to this issue.
Housekeeping of the house could be better. Overall my and my family didn't enjoy our stay in this residence."

and vanities were free of little knick-knacks and decorative accessories. We've rented some places that were so full of the owner's items that we didn't have room to unpack our own things.
We discovered a wonderful restaurant on this trip to Las Cruces : Le Rendez-vous.
An unassuming little place with delicious French-inspired food and pastries and very friendly staff. Highly recommended."

Stayed with kids","Perfect place for our family to stay for a visit to White Sands. The location is a new build and was clean and cozy for our stay. We greatly appreciated the available sleds for playing at White Sands. It was a huge savings compared to park prices.
The rooms were spacious and comfortable for our family of four. I would definitely recommend staying here if you’re in the area."

Stayed one night","I was in the middle of a move from Texas to California that had a few unknowns which didn't allow me to book a place to stay very far in advance. On top of that I was traveling with 3 animals so I knew my options would be limited. Fortunately though I found Carlo's listing the night before I was going to hit the road. The house looked nice, new and clean and they allowed all of my pets to stay for a small pet fee which I was very thankful for.
Carlos was extremely responsive and helpful, he accepted the booking within an hour which put my mind at ease for the long drive I had the next day. The day of he sent out instructions to locate the house and get inside. As mentioned in the listing it is in a new development so my navigation was unable to find it but Carlos gave very clear instructions on how to get there from a known landmark that my nav could find.
I got in pretty late and left early the next day but the house was very clean and exactly as described."

Stayed with a pet","I might be too picky, coming from a big city, the mosquitoes is what made me not love the place, plus the fact that my furry family didn't have much of a place to play outside. The backyard was very small and there are two more houses in the backyard, we were separated from them with a gate, but It didn't feel as private as I would like to feel when I am at home. If you are like me I would recommend you coming in fall or winter when you will not have to deal with the mosquitoes, and don't bring a big dog, the yard is almost ok for a small dog. If you don't have dogs, the place is awesome. The house is a sleeper, It is an ordinary house, when you drive in to it. The parking is another issue, if you have a long car like we do, you will have to park it in between the two cars of the other residents. Once you enter in the house
, the place is ABSOLUTELY astounding, my wife was very impressed with the paintings you have. The furniture was incredible and your kitchen is very ergonomic."

our girls’ trip. We had more than enough room.
The house was very warm and inviting. It was stocked with an enormous amount of amenities. The decor had a modern feel with a Southwestern artfulness. The house was very clean. The large windows in the first living room and Master Bedroom opened up the home. The beds were very comfortable. The pool was perfect for hot days. The best was hanging by the pool watching the sunset.
You have complete privacy. I would guesstimate each house sits on one to one and a half acres. A roadrunner strolled pass me when taking garbage out. A Great Horned Owl surprised us one night while we were sitting on the edge of the pool.
Jorge was a great host. He responded immediately when we had questions. Great communication.

Stayed with kids","Had a magical weeklong stay with our family. Pictures do not do this place justice. Serene setting, absolute immaculate interior. Sunsets that will take your breath away. The pool was an absolute gem. This stay was the most relaxed I have been in years. You will want for nothing at this beautiful home. We had initially planned to take an overnight stay during the trip to Carlsbad, but actually changed our plans because we did not want to leave this property. We had an initial malfunction with air conditioning which was beyond the owners control, but Jorge went above and beyond to address this issue. This will officially be our home away from home in the future. If I could rate more than 5 stars, I would."

The furniture is nice, beds are very comfortable, communication with Jorge was excellent, the pool is great. It felt like we were staying in someone’s nice home more than at a rental. Very nice location for us as well. We’d stay again and I’m sure we will! If you have small children like we do, you’ll need to keep an eye on them as the home is quite ideally set up for adults and older kids."

Ideal location in a great neighborhood. An hour between White Sands National Park and El Paso, a short drive from Old Mesilla Plaza and the Farmer’s Market for local shopping and restaurants.
Host was so nice and personable. We can’t thank Jorge enough for making us feel so welcome in his home that when we were in a pinch (in a state where we knew no one), I felt comfortable enough to call to ask for help. We realized our car battery died just as we were headed to catch our flight at the airport. The hosts’ lovely family came right away and saved us from missing our flight."

Group trip","Our family was in Las Cruces to celebrate our daughter's medical school graduation. We love Las Cruces and this home was the icing on the cake for our stay. When I say ""everything was perfect"", it is an understatement. The home itself is absolutely beautiful with every amenity one could wish for. We have never stayed in a home that was so well furnished from the comfortable beds all the way to the dishes ,platters, and outdoor furnishings. There were even saucer sleds for us to take to White Sands.
Upon arrival, Jorge had a bottle of wine and 2wine glasses set up on the kitchen counter... such a welcoming touch. There were toothbrushes, toothpaste, guest slippers and robes in each room as well.
Jorge was extremely attentive....the coffee maker was not working the first morning we were there , and he had a brand new one on the doorstep by that afternoon ! He also delivered a new iron as the one provided was leaking.
We will definitely return ! Thank you Jorge and Veronica!"

The house is fabulous. Great location just a few minutes away from the Organ Mountains, golf and downtown. The huge lot makes it extremely private. We arrived after dark and thought we may have trouble finding it but Veronica and Jorge have placed beautiful solar lights around the property and we saw their welcome glow as we pulled up. The kitchen is very well furnished. The beds are comfortable. The house is very clean, and the living room and kiva looks like a page out of a magazine showing New Mexican adobe design. We were there in late July and the high was 99 degrees.....sue....it was a ""dry"" heat, but the pool in the walled in, private backyard felt great. The pool area has great a great seating area including a table the is in shade most of the day. As nice as the house is you would be hard pressed to find more accommodating hosts than Veronica and Jorge. They are excellent communicators and make you feel like welcome guests. They are always available should the need arise. Looking for a private oasis with a pool> Rent this place."

The tub was also great!
Love the backyard space as well. Was a tad dissapointed about not being able to use the firepalce outside or inside, but otherwise lovely stay. I understand the reasons they don't want folks using that today (high winds, safety....)

EXCEPT it has very poor lighting in the open design living room, dining room and kitchen. I'm old and the night vision is going, so I may be biased. Every other room is well lit so I don't know why these ceiling lights have such weak wattage lights in this large space. Definitely worth overlooking this issue to stay here."

I only wished I were able to enjoy it more. The home was immaculate and had every amenity one could hope for. Kristian was very communicative and even recommended some amazing eating/drinking spots to visit while I was there. The next time I visit Las Cruces this will be my #1 choice for places to stay. Highly recommended! A+

Stayed with a pet","My favorite airbnb experience ever!! I stayed here with my partner and my dog while driving cross country. We had such a great time here. The bed was comfy, bathroom was clean and spacious. Had a washer & dryer. Outside had a hot tub, hammock and two fire pits, and two outdoor games to play. Only complaint, which I believe was my fault was that it was hot in the unit. We fed the animals and met the owner, who was super friendly! Asked about recommendations via messenger and owner responded promptly. We visited the white sands about 50 mins away from the property and the owner had sleds for us to use. Had a dog-run that was not listed in the description but a nice surprise!
Overall, we had a fantastic time, and loved that it was pet friendly. Host is friendly and responsive. Unit is clean and matched description, and went above and beyond expectations from the photos.
I don’t normally write reviews but this Airbnb was a place to write home about! Thank you!!"

The layout is incredibly thoughtful and contains every comfortable amenity. The pillows, blanket and bed were super comfortable and luxe. The bathroom is spacious, the kitchen is clean and modern. The patios were really nice too and we enjoyed sunset dinners! Jessica even provided farm fresh eggs. The stay is 50 minutes by highway from white sands national parks, and the host provided sleds for us which was great because the park doesn’t rent them. I would highly recommend staying here for a peaceful getaway and to experience a tiny but mighty home!"

The sheets and towels were fragrance-free which is important to us. Las Cruces is not much of a walking city, however we were able to walk to the bookstore and craft market."

It was a little hard to find where to go but we also came in around 9pm so that’s our fault. Las cruces is an interesting city there isn’t a whole lot to do there but we didn’t hang around too much anyways. The house was nice and clean when we got there and felt safe for us. It was about 40-50 mins from White Sands and about 3 1/2-4 hours from Albuquerque. Padma was super responsive and easy to communicate with!

Padma and Laura were very helpful and responsive to any questions. Very good ""Guidebook"" to the BnB and surrounding area -- restaurants etc. Saturday Market was a highlight -- just a few blocks walk. Short drive to historic and charming village of Mesilla with several great restaurants. (Don't miss La Posta and The Andele Dog House patio.)
Be sure to hike in the Organ Mts. maybe 20 to 25 minute easy drive depending on which hikes you choose. We loved the Dripping Springs hike into the canyon and also Soledad Canyon. Beautiful trails. We saw an oryx family on one hike and mule dear herd on another. Great picture taking.
BIG thanks to superhost Padma and her assistant Laura."

Stayed with a pet","This is a lovely Casita and was perfect for my 3 night stay while I was in town for a dog show. The private entrance yard was great for my dogs and the Casita was roomy, super clean, and very cute. I struggled a bit with finding the entrance and parking space, but that was only because I didn't look at the very descriptive photos that were in the check-in instructions like I should have! Padma was very kind and immediately responsive when I asked questions about getting in - even though it was completely MY fault for not seeing the photos! There was a neighbor dog across the street that barked a LOT (saw this in a previous review too)...but I never saw the dog...and it was not enough to deter me from staying again - this was still one of my favorite AirBNB locations so far and I hope to return to it again the next time I'm in town!"

When you first walk in, you are kind of thrown back by the bedroom being the first thing you see, but then you walk through the bedroom and are nicely surprised by the rest of the space. You could easily stay here a week! The kitchen living room and dining room are a great space. I feel you could even do a business trip here and feel super comfortable! The decor is absolutely adorable and a fresh change to everyone's brown houses and decor. The bathroom is pretty small, but works. I would suggest a pocket door. This place even has a small back yard to chill in, or let your furry friends outside."

It would have felt better for me to be with someone when I stayed since the entrance is down a little alleyway (glad I arrived in daylight) and I was traveling alone. Nothing about the place made me feel that way necessarily. It's more about me going to new places in new towns and not being familiar enough with my surroundings."

Stayed with a pet","Everything was great and the house is super cute and perfect for a weekend stay. The small private fenced area made it easy to bring the dogs. Overall great stay with responsive and helpful hosts. The only hiccup was the AC. Since you can only run one mini unit at a time without the breaker flipping, you have to choose between cool bedroom or cool living area and the half of the house not being cooled is unbearably hot and not safe to leave the dogs in."

My boyfriend and I were traveling through Las Cruces and arrived to the Airbnb very late. It was an easy check in and check out. Because we arrived so late we didn’t fully get to take in the amenities of the space, but from observation everything was clean, comfortable, and cozy.
The space is small but has everything you need to feel at home."

Since there were so many fantastic restaurants we never cooked for ourselves but the full kitchen was perfect. Easy check-in/out and so many thoughtful extras. I can't say enough good things about Casa Azul. Thanks so much, Padma & co. We're already looking forward to our next visit!"

After some initial confusion on where the lockbox was located everything went smoothly. The place is very spacious and clean and comfortable. We were only there for the night and then out early the next morning. I regret that we did not have more time as it looked like the place would be a great base for exploring the area and the neighborhood. The host was very helpful with getting things squared away as we were driving to the location.

We experienced issues with heating and power outages due to undersized electrical system, we were staying in winter. Padma addressed the problem immediately, installing two separate state of the art heating systems which kept the casita warm and comfortable. We highly recommend staying at any of Padma’s properties, very well managed with a professional, friendly crew."

Stayed with a pet","Charming, cozy, comfortable place. Decor was like out of a magazine, but not sterile - has very appealing character. The exposed adobe bricks were cool. Extremely clean. Climate control was great. One of the best stocked bathrooms we’ve seen. Kitchen also well stocked and appreciated the complementary eggs and coffee. Great location for urban activities and less than 1 hour to not-to-be-missed White Sands Natl Park. Neighborhood was quiet and felt safe. I wear earplugs while sleeping and couldn’t hear traffic except for the occasional distant roar of souped-up trucks/motorcycles. The biggest noise issue is the very loud and prolonged train horns, 3 times each night/pre-dawn. But I was so comfortable that I quickly fell back asleep by the second night of it. One review said the parking space was too small, but we were able to easily fit our late-model Subaru Outback. Hosts were immediately responsive to questions. Would definitely stay here again."

There were some very thoughtful touches - doggy bed, food and water bowls for my dog. The only real issues I had were the heating system seemed a little inadequate for a really cold morning, which I think Padma intends to address, and on my last morning a breaker flipped, but co-host Laura talked me through finding the breaker box (outside) and getting everything back on (and she did offer to come over and take care of it, which was not necessary!)

There was actually even some small amount of food in the fridge (English muffins) and eggs which came as a surprise to me. I love that as I wanted to make my own breakfast versus going out.
I love the blue kitchen and the television was highest order. Bed was comfortable, and I fell in love with the decorative sink in the bathroom.
The bed was large and so comfortable. The small patio was cute too with again, New Mexico reflection which I adore.
Wish the parking weren't as tight, but you can also park alongside the road I believe. Larger/longer cars would have a problem otherwise.
This was a fun stay for my last day in New Mexico, and a great value in my opinion for the well kept dwelling and what the hosts offer, making you truly feel home away from home.
Well done!"

Stayed one night","I booked with Padma because a number of my own airbnb guests had stayed at Casa Azul and had good things to say about the place. I was traveling to a wedding in Las Cruces, and stayed only one night, but it was certainly a place that would be comfortable for a longer stay. I had trouble entering and unlocking the lock box, but Padma was shortly on her way to help. Everything was perfect: the location, tastefully decorated, lovely art, very comfortable bed, sparkling kitchen! Thank you Padma."

Stayed a few nights","Such a lovely and comfortable casita! We were pleasantly surprised by how spacious it was. My husband is 6'5"" so the king bed is a must, and hard to find! It was very clean and well-appointed, and surprisingly quiet for such a central location. You can walk to main street/downtown, but the casita is tucked behind another house so it still feels cozy and private. It is perfect for a couple, and also has a very secure little fenced area where a dog would be safe. There were nice, welcoming touches throughout like a dog bed & bowls, a nice selection of teas and coffee, and breakfast necessities like eggs and butter. There are 2 evaporative window coolers which worked very well. In fact, we turned the temp up a little and turned them off at night because the casita stayed pretty cool if they were on during the day. Cute, clean & comfy! A great value and definitely recommended."

It was so convenient to be able to park the car in the garage and have a garage door opener, I loved that! The decor was fabulous and I enjoyed discovering every little detail.

The tranquil vibes and decor were on point and the space just had so many delightful surprises. If you're on the fence, don't be! Book without reservation!
Great location and the gate cited in the description is open sometimes so you can sneak right to main/i70 if you're lucky but it's super cool closed too and despite being on campus of the new hospital and on the main road you really feel like you're in a spa retreat!
I'm going to copy several things from the decor at my place. I can't say enough good about this place!
Thank you SO MUCH for being an you claim to be and more. It really was epic!! We got to show it off for dinner and games with friends and family and everyone who got the pleasure of stopping in had their jaw on the floor!! It was so fun!!!!"

Jessica was very responsive and informative. I highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys a beautiful, peaceful, and relaxing environment. I would like to share a word of caution with those who are not familiar with the area and are traveling with dogs; There are not many grassy areas to walk pets, although there are several parks within a 2-3 mile radius that are dog friendly. I called Jessica upon arrival and she explained that there were some spots I could take them to but unfortunately, my dogs were not used to the sandy, rocky terrain and I ended up taking them to a nearby park for potty breaks. This is not a negative reflection on Jessica or the home in any way, just a side note for those traveling with pets who are unfamiliar with the area."

However, everything was clearly communicated and instructions provided through the post as well as at the house. The space was amazing, comfy, clean, and very inviting. Looove the private oasis on the back porch. Thank you so much!"

We appreciated the luxurious decor, the jacuzzi and outdoor fireplace, and the fancy shower. The bed and bedding were very comfortable. This was a great place for us to relax and unwind after a day on the road. We would definitely stay with Jessica again!"

Stayed with kids","The listing really does speak for itself, but Jessica’s place is a true beautiful respite. Amazing view of the mountains from the back patio, very nice quiet front patio, there is no corner of the place that is not being used for beauty or comfort.
Also we were traveling with our toddler, and Jessica’s place was truly perfect. Lots of space for him to move around without anything for him to break which is an actual relaxing point for parents. Beyond that, Jessica ensures the kitchen and bedrooms have everything a parent could need from plastic plates and bowls and toddler utensils to a pack and play.
The ultimate joy though was still for these tired parents! So much beautiful space to relax, read, jump in the hot tub or enjoy the amazing shower and bathroom for getting ready, sleep in a big cozy bed - everything was just EASY and lovely!
A huge thanks to Jessica for making such a beautiful spot and being such a lovely host!"

Stayed a few nights","HOME AWAY FROM HOME- but more ritzy!
We wanted a getaway, and this filled the bill. The most spacious bnb we've stayed in. It would easily accomodate 4 adults plus a child ..We could gladly have spent the whole time at the townhouse and on the patio with hot tub and fire pit . However, Las Cruces has magnificent mountain trails to hike. Saw oryx and mule deer on the Dripping Springs trail, then retreated to the hot tub to relax. Everything is minutes away -- Old Mesiilla included. The only pause i had was how close the bnb is to a major highway, but once inside did not hear the traffic. Maybe the sound machines in the bedrooms were just so soothing.
Definitely will be back."

Stayed a few nights","The place is very unassuming when you pull up, but once you enter the front gate and get into the house it’s worth it. High ceilings in the living space/master bedroom. Very well laid out. I stay at a lot of vacation rentals and there are usually some fit and finish things that diminish the place overall, but I can’t ding this place for any of those. It was more space than I needed for 36 hours, but I’d stay here again in a heartbeat. Not that it really mattered to me on this trip, but the patio wasn’t as private as I would’ve hoped/expected it would be, but I loved the place as a whole."

Also, there were lots and lots of extras that we’ve never seen elsewhere. The home is fully stocked. Our initial response on entering the house was shocked at how beautiful it was. Also there is a garage. Jessica always responded with any messages that I sent. Overall this was a tremendous experience and we plan to return."

Stayed with a pet","Wow! We are frequent Airbnb users, and this is absolutely the most beautiful Airbnb we have ever stayed in. Jessica was a wonderful host. We ended up arriving much later than anticipated due to bad weather and it was no issue at all. In fact, we had a 1 week stay booked (with another host) that was canceled 2 weeks before our trip. I had to scramble to find new accommodations, and unfortunately, we had to split the trip up into 3 separate stays. Jessica's place was the 3rd stay, and not only was it the best and most comfortable, it was a welcomed relief. We had a long day of driving, and this place was immaculate upon arrival. The spa shower was just what I needed, and the bed was so comfortable that I told my family to go on without me and that I was staying behind. It was more than enough room for a family of 5 and 2 pups. It's basically a spa retreat. So if you like the sound of that, just do it. She even had sleds for white sands and items to make your pups feel at home as well!"

SO many little touches that just make you feel relaxed and at home. I loved the welcome sign with my name on it. My dogs loved the dog bones, and it made them feel welcome too! First Airbnb I've stayed at with my dogs that offered them something to feel at home. My husband and I enjoyed playing the Hookey game and making breakfast sandwiches with the breakfast station! It was so relaxing sitting in the jacuzzi with the lights above. I was sad Jessica's location was booked the day we checked out because if it was not, then we would have booked one more night and extended our trip home just to stay there!

Stayed a few nights","A peaceful base while we were in town from Ohio for my uncles funeral. The home was spotless and everything was seemingly brand new. The cleanliness made us feel right at home. The host went above and beyond with snacks and conveniences like bags, coffee, etc which was much appreciated after a long trip. The home was in a safe neighborhood. Neighborhood is central to Las Cruces restaurants and shops. We would absolutely stay here again and hope to come back to visit white sands!"

Stayed a few nights",Octavio’s Farmhouse Home was exactly what we wanted. Everything was clean and comfortable. Octavio was so easy to talk to and helped answer every question we had. If you are looking for a nice getaway this is the place! I would book it again in a heartbeat! The neighborhood was so lovely and my family felt very safe. True definition of home away from home. ❤️

Stayed a few nights","I honestly don’t know where to start with describing how great Octavio’s place was. It’s beautifully furnished, smells nice and has so many of the comforts from home (bidet anyone?)
The beds were comfortable and the linens were super soft. It felt like a high end hotel.
We loved having the grill - it made making dinner a breeze. Though we didn’t use them, I was impressed with all the small appliances in the pantry. If you really wanted to make a lot of meals, you’d be all set.
The 4 of us loved being able to recline in the evenings and watch movies together on the very comfortable sofas.
This was a great location for visiting White Sands National Park, as well as various hikes nearby. We went to Dripping Springs and had a blast.
The restaurant recommendations in the Welcome Binder were great. We especially enjoyed Luna Rossa’s Pizza and A Bite of Belgium!
Thank you, Octavio for the gifts and snacks. My teens had a ball munching on the fun snacks that mom doesn’t buy. 😁"

Stayed a few nights","Octavio’s AirBnB is beautiful! He is an excellent host and has thought of everything a guest may need. The farmhouse aesthetic is warm, inviting, and classy. Would 10 out of 10 recommend staying at this AirBnB and any additional properties he owns. I felt at home and comfortable."

Stayed a few nights",This was the best Airbnb we have ever stayed in. Octavio was incredible - he anticipated questions and reached out frequently to make sure we didn’t need anything. The home was extremely clean and well stocked. The location was great - convenient to the freeway for traveling to White Sands National Park and Organ Mountain - Desert Peaks National Monument. Would definitely stay here again!

Stayed with kids","This place is incredible and the nicest AirBNB we have ever stayed in. The pictures don’t do it justice how clean and pristine the property is. So many amenities (snacks! Toiletries! Gifts for guests!) and it was perfect for our three year old (books, games, and Disney+ — what more do you need?). We used it as home base to visit White Sands and Hatch, and it was perfect. Would love to stay again!"

Octavio was super helpful, checking in regularly, and making sure we had everything we needed. I truly appreciated the easy entry and accessibility as this was a last-minute reservation. This private home is beautiful and comfortable, with easy access to the freeway, restaurants and shopping. I would highly recommend it."

Stayed with kids","Octavio’s place was amazing! I have stayed in many places in AirBnb and this one is definitely in my top five AirBnb. Such a great place for the price. The place is staged and prepared for the comfort of the guess such as large kitchen amenities (breakfast cereal, spices, coffees) along with every utensil to entertainment setup (large TVs in every room and fast internet), clean bathrooms (every bathroom has enough towels, shampoo, conditioner and soap) to a nice beds in every room. Getting in was easy with keypads and remote Garage (if you drive). This is a good place to stay if you want to visit White Sands National Park (only about 40 mnts drive to the entrance). Nearby, there are enough restaurants, and if you forget anything, Walmart is just minutes away. Octavio was responsive and very flexible in terms of check out and check in. If I can give this place more than 5 stars, I would."

Stayed over a week","We stayed in the home for 3 weeks and found it very comfortable, easy to access, well equipped. The home is beautifully decorated and extremely functional. There were all of the appliances we wanted including toaster, toaster oven, gas grill, and several items we didn’t use. There were ample linens and towels. The garage was spacious enough for our pickup truck and bikes. This was our first visit to Las Cruces and we really enjoyed the area and had a great time. We visited Carlsbad Caverns, the Space Museum in Alamogordo, White Sands NP, mission trail in El Paso area, the museums in Las Cruces, Mesilla, Dripping Springs, hiked in the Organ Mountains, biked extensively and more. This is the best Airbnb we have stayed in by far."

Stayed a few nights","Don't pass this place up...it is absolutely amazing!!! We rent AirBnbs often and all of us said this had to be one of our favorites by far! Octavio has made this beautiful home a renter's dream. The place is immaculate and sooo clean. He really took time with his attention to detail. From the extremely comfy beds and linens, extra pillows and blankets, reclining couches, huge TVs and ceiling fans in every room, plenty of soft plush towels, well thought-out amenities for the kitchen/bathrooms, to it's convenient location with restaurants and shopping galore, as well as amazing views, this place will set the tone for an unforgettable stay. Octavio is also very accommodating and easy to work with. Such a great stay, we've decided to make it an annual trip. I highly recommend this AirBnb if you plan to stay in Las Cruces 🧡"
