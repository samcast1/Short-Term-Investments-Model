Stayed a few nights","We arrived at Julie’s in the late afternoon, it’s a 2nd floor apartment with lots of stairs but we had no problem with them. It’s right downtown so as soon as you walk out the door everything is right there! We appreciated how clean the place was and had everything we needed. The beds weren’t the most comfortable but no big deal. Other reviewers complained about a cat smell, it did not smell like cats. The building is old so it has an older smell to it but nothing that a little fresh air from an open window didn’t cure. I also like to bring a diffuser or candle when I take a road trip, makes me feel more at home.
Overall I would definitely recommend Julie’s place. It was a quaint, clean apartment, which is exactly what we were looking for.
We especially loved that it was right downtown!!!💕"

Stayed with kids","The place was easy to get to and located within walking distance of most things we wanted. Upon entering, there was a noticeable smell of cat urine. Unfortunately, even after opening windows and buying deodorizers to sit around it lingered the whole time we were there. There was a weird stickiness to the floors, perhaps the cleaning solution that is being used. The bathroom sink was very slow to drain and we plunged it several times. Also there was a weird rolled up paper towel filling a hole in the ceiling tile of the primary bedroom. The pullout bed could use some updating. We pulled off the worn spring in the couch and just put it on the living room floor for my granddaughter. It should probably also be said up front that the mattresses are VERY soft. We enjoyed ourself but sleeping wasn't great."

There was a lingering cat odor upon arrival but it improved over the duration of our stay. The shared laundry was far better than no laundry facilities but did necessitate cleaning pet hair out of the washer and dryer before using. Overall, it was exactly as advertised and fit our needs very well."

Stayed one night","This was my favorite Airbnb! The apartment was the best decorated and appointed space I've ever stayed in. The color palate, furniture, and decor were thoughtfully done. The couch was very comfortable, and I counted 6 large windows that brought in ample natural light. Soft bed linens, comfortable pillows, and the professionally designed space made this apartment stand out. We walked a few blocks to have dinner at George's and walked again to get our breakfast at Lola's Bistro. We loved the location. Craig was also very responsive when we had a question. Also, there wasn't a long list of ""chores"" before check-out, which I appreciated. I would love to stay at this lovely little apartment again. This was the perfect romantic getaway for my husband and I."

Stayed a few nights","Cute place to stay right in town, could walk to most places. There are 20 steps to get up to the apt. The bed was just ok, we leaned into the center. You are right downtown so there is street noise. It’s decorated very cute, but has no table to sit and play cards, so we used the coffee table. The tv situation is a bummer, couldn’t watch the Vikings game. Oh well, they lost. We had good communication with the owner. We were in town on a Monday and Tuesday and some businesses were closed."

The ceiling fan in the bedroom could not be turned up as it shook so bad, it was like it might come down. The overall apartment was cute and comfortable. It is an old building so there were some musty smells (add in the heat) but the location was good and the apartment was comfortable. There was an odd placement of the tv, so you could only watch it if you moved some furniture around. For the price, it was fine."

Stayed a few nights","Everything about this place is adorable. It gives off Cow Hollow/Marina Distinct San Francisco apartment vibes. Old bones, white walls, French doors, & impeccably designed with quality pieces. When the sun shined in, it was really beautiful!
Well-stocked kitchen & even the dishes are nice. Very quiet, very comfortable & very safe (even at night). And, the exterior of the building is as cute & chic as the apartment. The best part is pulling up to a whim wall of wild flowers in the parking lot! Definitely my favorite airbnb so far. 10 out of 10!
For food & drink - The Minnesota St. location is the main shopping area & everything you need is within walking distance.
Sweethaven Tonics has such a cool vibe & serves killer cocktails & mocktails. Lola’s for coffees & farm-to-table comfort food, Kaiserhoff for traditional German food & Lakes on 1st for a small town diner-style breakfast. Also - the backyard at Schell’s Brewery on a nice day can’t be beat (a few miles away)!"

While many of the shops were closed for the 4th of July holiday, we still found a few open as well as other local 4th activities. When open, the town area is easily walkable from Craig’s house. As to the flat itself, it’s very comfortable and has most everything a couple might need for a relaxing evening of dinner and TV. It’s as the photos show tastefully decorated and Craig is a helpful, responsive host. Recommend it completely!"

Group trip","This is a great little apartment in downtown New Ulm. It has everything you need for a stay. It's a cozy place but it's all you need. The beds were comfortable. The kitchen was well stocked. There was only a Kerig for coffee, but they provided a ton of pods. We were able to park right outside the front door.
The location is just the best. It is located right off of the main street in downtown. Each night we walked to dinner and bars. There is a really good bakery right across the street too! We were in town for Bockfest and we were easily able to walk downtown and and get transportation out to the brewery.
The only negative would be that there is some street noise, otherwise it was a wonderful stay."

What a great man and his place is what is expected. !!! Actually even better since we were surprised with the nice and calm residential area the house is located. If we are back to New Ulm we know for sure our first option would be to check “availability “ with him . By the way .. Daniel’s spanish is marvelous ( taken from us . We are Spanish native speakers ) and he will entertain you with stories and anecdotes from his travels 🧳
We loved the place but above all Daniel !!! Smart , respectful , open minded , caring .. That is the impression we got and keep from NEW ULM ✨
Daniel ., You got friends in California:)

Stayed one night","Staying at Daniel 's house represented the heart and spirit of of what sharing a home through Airbnb truly means . He made us feel at ease inmediately and invited us to sit and chat for a while if we so desired. We had a great conversation, as Daniel is a person with a genuine and humble heart. The house itself is beautiful and the neighborhood extremely peaceful. We had our own bathroom and felt very comfortable with Daniel' s care for his guests. . We slept very well and the neighborhood is extremely peaceful. There are also places to eat near the area. If you are in New Ulm and need a place, Daniel has his home open for a true experience of hospitality."

Group trip","We were surprised & pleased to find a half bath located on the ground floor. Don't recall that it was mentioned in the description of the property. Those of us that are elderly could use a grab bar in the tub and the stairs are a bit steep. Other than that we found everything ship shape & enjoyed our stay - even though we were mainly there to sleep & bathe. We had a 1st cousins' reunion in New Ulm as our great grandparents were the Melges family that owned the bakery, now on the National Historic Register, & they are buried in New Ulm cemetery. I noticed a delightful little chipmunk paid us a visit on the deck both mornings. Naturally we were intrigued by the mention of the mysterious 3rd bedroom in the Guest Notebook! Guess it will remain a mystery! Thanks for making our stay comfortable Lee Ann."

New Ulm is a cute little town and the downtown has a super selection of restaurants. If you have never traveled from Minneapolis to New Ulm-Think ahead and prepare yourself for a long scenic drive. We stopped at The Largest Candy store and were overwhelmed by such a great attraction, loaded up on funny treats.
Extra thanks to Team VacationHaus for leaving a few items for breakfast, great stock of condiments and coffee!
Happy Stay! Minnesota is beautiful.!"

Stayed over a week","This is A beautiful home with so many comforts and stylish decor. Its right in town on a main street so all New Ulm has to offer is close by. Lee Ann was quick to respond and worked with me on a few different things. She is a wonderful host. One thing I expected to be different was parking. The driveway mentioned in the listing was only a few feet long so would work for motorcycles or smart cars but not for most vehicles. We would have preferred off street parking but it worked out okay. The temperature difference between the main floor and the upstairs was significant so i ended up sleeping in the living room. I am a bit more sensitive to cold than most so this won't matter to most who stay at The Vacation Haus. All in all the stay was enjoyable and we would stay again. I recommend visiting Domeier's store, Herman the German statue, a visit to the Schell Brewery and eating at Keiserhoff."

Stayed with kids","The apartment is absolutely beautiful and everything is as shown in the listing. I would love to give an excellent review but unfortunately we could not get ahold of the host for assistance getting into the building. We were given a physical key instead of a key card and needed a key card to get in the door we were instructed to use. After trying to contact the host on the app, text, call and through Airbnb support, we were able to get into the building through the gift shop and then up to our apartment through the stairs. It would have been no problem if we knew ahead of time but the directions the host provided did not match what we needed to do to get inside. We even sent a message after check in to make sure we understood which doors would be unlocked when we got back for the evening since we have small children but didn't get a response. Would have loved to leave a great review otherwise."

Big kitchen with a fabulous stainless steel island.
Fans provided as some rooms were a bit too hot at night in summer, despite the AC.
I don't know how they were getting in, but we killed wasps daily—probably 8-10 in total. I'm allergic, so this was the only annoyance.
Super wonderful space, and close to everything. You are down in a very old industrial area, but can walk up to the main streets."

The nearby Goosetown Park is a plus for energetic kids & pups.

Kitchen was well stocked. Lots of space in the kitchen to gather. Two of the bedrooms have bathrooms. There is a third bathroom and the end of the hall. Enough bathroom linens for all of us. We even had a Robin sitting in her nest with 3 eggs on one of the windowsills.
Use the photos to find the entrance! Know that there are steep stairs to enter. We didn’t mind but could see this as a concern for some. The beds are comfortable - on the soft side. The bed linens were very soft and cozy. Lots of dvds and magazines.
We will stay for future events and already recommend to a friend and her family coming for MLC graduation in the future."

All of the beds were comfortable and you could check out which ones were soft or firm to find the one you liked.
The kitchen was huge with lots of bar stools and table seating for meals.
Things we didn't care for, but out of the owner's control: the train whistle at random hours of the night and it stopping so you couldn't get across for a while. There was a tall flight of stairs, so be considerate of your guest's walking abilities."

The kitchen and dining room were spacious, as was the living room which made it a comfortable place for everyone to hang out. Mary was very responsive to all my questions so I never was left hanging waiting for information.
Downtown New Ulm is a very short walk from this location, so it's really easy to get to any restaurants and bars that you are interested in. The town is a pretty fun one to explore on foot due to the ""old river town"" feel of the architecture, mixed with some German influences. And if the weather doesn't cooperate and you have to spend most of your trip indoors, even large groups will be comfortable at the Warehaus."

We slept 12 people very comfortably with all the bedrooms and multiple bathrooms/showers, the entire place was clean and had neat decor! It was also a quick, easy walk to several restaurants and shops! I would definitely stay here again!"

Group trip","Mary and Topher have a unique and fun property unlike any other you can stay in around New Ulm. It is in a super cool old warehouse with the most eclectic style, exciting art, quaint touches, and cozy gathering spaces for a group. The kitchen is fully stocked and we were easily able to cook and bake together for our wellness retreat weekend together. It offered the perfect amount of space for us to both be able to go off into a quiet place by ourselves when we wanted a nap or some time to read quietly. But at the same time others could be in the group spaces watching Netflix, playing board games, or just drinking coffee and laughing together. 9 of us ladies fit very comfortably into the space without feeling crowded, but rather having a sense of coziness and warmth that you wouldn't get in a hotel or conventional B and B's. We had 3 beautiful bathrooms for soaking in a bubble bath which all of us ladies took advantage of at some point in the weekend. This space would be perfect for: a girls weekend, a couple of families in town for a weekend of sports who want to have the ability to cook together or have a space to chill in between games, extended family in town over holidays who you would like to put up in a space where they aren't crammed into small hotel rooms and you can all hang out together, etc. As a resident of New Ulm for many years I am well acquainted with the other properties in town and this one is a stand-out. I will definitely be using it for future wellness retreats that I host. Thanks so much Mary and Topher!"

It is also apparent that Mary put thought into all the little extra touches—the vibe was very welcoming and inviting. We had one little question, and Mary was quick to respond and was so friendly. We also loved that the building is walking distance to downtown New Ulm and only half a block from the Minnesota River. We highly recommend a stay at the Warehaus!!!

Group trip","Charalee was incredibly responsive during our stay. We had a couple of questions about bings and she responded very quickly.
The house was incredibly stocked with supplies such as toiletries and linens. It was probably the most accommodating stay that I’ve ever had.
I do think it’s important to note that the house is on the main road through town so there is a good deal of traffic noise at the front of the house. It wasn’t much of an issue for us but it is good to know.
We had beautiful weather, so hanging out in the back yard was absolutely delightful.
Charalee was flexible with check in and check out making it incredibly easy for 9 of us coming from all different directions.
Thank you for helping to make our annual girls trip so wonderful! Oh, I almost forgot the special treat she left for us! SO kind! Thanks Charalee!!"

The basement bedroom had a musty smell which was a concern for all of us. The main floor only had a 1/2 bath and you had to enter the main floor bedroom to get there. We ended up going to a hotel and the host was not willing to negotiate. We enjoyed the city of New Ulm as it had a lot to offer."

Stayed over a week","I stayed here this summer for a legal internship that I had. The place was nice and I thought Rod to be amenable. However, at 2 in the morning I received the nastiest message I think I have ever gotten from someone. Rod was irrationally angry and insulted me because he had been going in the apartment and didn't like how I kept my property. Keep in mind, I was living there for 3 months, so I had to have quite a few things. He threatened to take all my belongings and put them at the end of the curb when I was gone and change the locks. Why? Because Rod thought the place was a mess. In objective reality, I had shoes on a rug by the door, clothes folded in a chair, and dishes washed/drying in a sink. These things are what he was angry with, not anything about his apartment. The text was so unhinged and threatening that I chose to leave 2 weeks early. With getting such an aggressive message at 2 in the morning, I was concerned that Rod would do something worse to me at a time when I slept."

Stayed a few nights","I stayed over the Christmas holiday and as you know, it snows in Minnesota so there was a blizzard which delayed my arrival. When I did arrive, snow was removed so parking was not a challenge. As soon as I opened up the door to the AirBnB, my stress diminished. To say that I was completely impressed and in awe of this place is an understatement. The pictures do not do justice! It is more spacious than it appeared in pictures. Not only was this place perfect, it was perfectly priced when comparing to other AirBnB's in New Ulm. Everything I could have possibly needed was available to me, including a Keurig AND not 1 but 2 complimentary bottles of wine (which helped with the stress)! Everything was in pristine condition (the carpet even smelled new yet). It is very relaxing here. Rod was very communicative with me and responded to all of my messages, and even sent a message to make sure I arrived and that everything was ok. This will definitely be my go-to place when I stay in New Ulm."

Stayed with kids","This unit is in pristine condition! We absolutely experienced a WOW factor upon arrival - everything seemed new and was immaculately clean and very well decorated. Rod and Roz added a personal touch of a welcoming bottle of wine and refreshments in the fridge. So kind! The master bed was very comfortable. Though the unit can sleep four, the dining seating was only for two, so we suggested addition of dining seating so that a whole family can eat together. The industry across the street made noise causing vibrations in the unit during business hours and sometimes earlier, but this is not the hosts' fault. I am unsure whether this is temporary or consistent. Again, this is outside of Rod and Roz's control. The unit was otherwise exceptional and we would welcome the opportunity to stay again."

The house is stylish and has a very comfortable/cozy feel. Well stocked kitchen with dishes, utensils, pots and pans, but minimal seasonings. If you want more than salt pepper make sure you add it to your shopping list. There were coupons for local places to eat, a great visitors guide book for the area, a couple cans of the local Schells beer in the fridge with a bottle of wine. Since this was our anniversary they left us a happy anniversary note with a bottle of champagne, very thoughtful!

The large bedroom has a walk-in closet and a super comfortable king-size bed with soft, high quality bedding. The bathroom is spotless and has plenty of bright-colored towels on hand. We used the gas grill on the patio, which was a bonus. We didn't stay long enough to use the washer/dryer but was great to have available.

Beautiful sunrises from the big round window. Plenty of room for the 4 of us. Close to everything we needed to be close to. We didn’t need to utilize the information, but they have so much detail in their welcome book. Bethany is super sweet & friendly, and was always responsive. As others have mentioned, try to go there first in daylight, because our gps didn’t quite get us all the way, but we could see it, so no problem. Will definitely keep The Grainery in mind for any future trips back this way."

We spent a few hours every evening down by the creek, listening to the birds and water rushing with a glass of wine. The surprise factor included the company of three friendly cats who kept us company whenever we were outside, even greeting us at the door each morning. I definitely plan on returning to recharge.
The Grainery was less than a 2 hour drive from the Twin Cities (from the south metro). Just far enough to escape, but close enough that it didn't seem too far for a two night trip."

Whether the sound of the river, the wind through the trees, the star-filled night sky, the welcoming far kitties, or the space itself - there is certainly something here for everyone to enjoy."

Group trip","Very clean and spacious accommodation. Much more suited to a family or one couple staying there than multiple couples due to the single bathroom (as described on airbnb so we knew ahead of time) and the openness of the interior. Worked very well for our family who was in the area to attend our daughter's college graduation. Bethany was very easy to communicate with and responded quickly. Wish we could have explored the pretty location more and had planned to use the fire pit, but we were so tired after our days out that we just crashed when we got back to the Grainery. The outdoor cats were extremely friendly and rolled right over to be petted when we went outside. :) Note that Google maps doesn't take you quite all the way to the Grainery but stops at the second to last house. You have to go all the way to the end of the road for the Grainery, but the hanging lights at night at the Grainery helped us figure it out. Glad we chose to stay here rather than a hotel. It was a positive experience for our first time staying in an airbnb."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I traveled to Sleepy Eye, MN for Easter weekend and could not have been more pleased with our stay at The Grainery! Our oldest daughter is temporarily working in Sleepy Eye and our youngest is in college in Chicago. The location worked perfectly for the four of us to be together for a long weekend. Bethany was extremely welcoming and the three outdoor cats were a joy to have around. We normally travel with board games, but didn't need them......we spent most of our time playing Sorry and Rummikub which ""came"" with the place! While we were there, three of us had to check in for work/school and the internet worked perfectly for us all to be on at the same time. Special bonus, the mattresses were so comfy that our oldest took note of the brand for a future purchase! We would definitely stay at The Grainery again!"

Stayed with kids","The Grainery was quite a find. The entire place was immaculately clean when we got there which was very important to us during this COVID pandemic throughout the country. It had everything we could have wanted and was like staying at a friend's own home. Very large, it allowed us plenty of space for ourselves and two grandchildren. It was very hot during our stay in Minn. and the A/C was a great relief from the heat. While we enjoyed the roomy facilities, the children enjoyed exploring the grounds around, with chickens and cats to entertain them, wonderful gardens and yard, it was like staying at a park.
Bethany was very easy to communicate with, very responsive with text and email, never having to wait for anything, and even gentle checking to make sure all of our needs were taken care of during our stay.
We will definitely look for the Grainery when back in the area again."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I and another couple headed to Bethany’s Unique guest home on a super cold weekend ready to nestle in and relax. Due to the weather we weren’t able so use the outdoor space but it looked very nice. I would rate this place 5’s for cleanliness, comfy beds/liens, good communication and style! However because of the shape of the building the lay out is a bit strange. There are 2 draw backs; 1- in order to use the bathroom you must walk directly through a sleeping area ( which is directly next to the open kitchen space- and entrance) 2- you need to carry your food upstairs to eat at a table. The upper room has great views. There is another bed and a TV area, but it needs more comfort seating. Over all it is a nice place to stay, IF you are going with family or close friends... just know there is not a lot of privacy."

Stayed with kids","Honestly. Everything is beyond what you would expect. Location was perfectly nestled off of 14 which was our normal in/out road for family visits. The property offered beautiful views and a sweet little walk along Sleepy Eye Creek. You can tell Justin and Beth put their time into building out the Grainery, and each details shows how skilled they are at restoring such a unique space. On top of that, they have everything you need from kitchen to bathroom to sleep and if you needed anything random, they have that too (looking at you packet of miracle whip in the fridge). Our trips to the area seem to be dwindling down, but if I can, I will 100% return to Beth and Justin’s."

Group trip","My friends and I had a garden party planned with an overnight stay afterwards. Bethany and her husband were willing to let us entertain in their yard by a creek with a full canopy setup. We had to arrive before the check in time to make it work, and Bethany was more than willing to permit that. They offered to let us use their fire pit and patio, too, however, when it unexpectedly rained we had to move the group indoors. Bethany’s husband helped us load furniture in a Gator which was also totally unexpected but so helpful. Throughout our stay they were just entirely too generous. They even offered to let us use their really nice, clean hot tub.
The Grainery itself was extremely tidy and clean and we were so comfortable. Plenty of sleeping areas and extra blankets as needed. It served as a respite from the humidity and heat and the kitchen was fully functional which helped to continue our party without a hitch. The location was not difficult to find with gps and the quiet nature in their backyard was lovely. They also had a few friendly outdoor cats who were great hosts and checked in with us every now and then too.
I was so impressed with these hosts and would absolutely recommend the Grainery!"

We were a bit apprehensive about privacy, but that was never a concern; we scarcely saw the hosts. They also have the world's friendliest cats, who greeted us at the door whenever we emerged from the house and accompanied us wherever we went outside, and even tried to go home with us as well!

Everything was clean and the beds were very comfortable. The kitchen had everything we needed, including a Kuerig coffee maker. Bethany was a great host and provided us with everything we needed, even all the fixings for s’mores. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a quiet setting in the country and a very comfortable stay in a unique structure."

Just my husband and me, but could be a perfect get away for any kind of women's craftying weekend, very large table upstairs. I had to give it a 4 star instead of a 5 because Bethany really needs to upgrade the poor quality micro fiber bedsheets to match the luxury of the rest of the furnishings."

Her family treated us with the fastest response and awesome hospitality. For instance, I called at 10pm which is kinda late, however, the host, Justin answered my question without any impatience. They have a nice little creek behind the house, plus the starry night is just amazing. To be honest, I miss it already."

We enjoyed the fire pit down by the river with kindling and pieces of fire wood at hand. Be aware, eating table is upstairs. These is a small island in the kitchen. We had Thanksgiving Dinner these so had to make multiple trips up and down. All in all, a very enjoyable getaway complete with a very large round window for viewing sunsets, darling cats to befriend, lovely grounds to explore boardered by a small river, and a very fun round swing for kids. Excellent communication with owners."

Over the course of many years, we have traveled all over Europe and this place easily measures up to the best of the villas we have stayed in.

Stayed a few nights","The Grainery is the finest Air Bnb location we have stayed and I have stayed at quite a few great ones. The amount of work and love Beth and her husband put into this place is apparent in all of the details and it is just spectacular from top to bottom. The top floor with the balcony overlooking the woods and creek, church window overlooking the county and recessed tower ceiling are truly one of a kind features that make the Grainery so unique. It must be seen and experienced as photos can't do it justice. We loved the location and all the surrounding beauty from the forest to the nearby creek and lots of fun things to do within a short drive to Sleepy Eye and New Ulm. Beth and her family were wonderful hosts and greeted us and showed us all we needed but gave us a lot of space and privacy to enjoy the Grainery. It was the perfect place to spend our anniversary!"

Let me just say circle window, upper balcony and upper ceiling. There is a fire pit and a creek, oh and the landscaping around the house is very well kept.
Bethany is the best host I have ever had. She was always quick to respond to anything and sent us alternative directions since there is construction on a normal route. That made it easy to get to. I've never done a repeat of an Airbnb, but we will be back.
We live in Minnespolis and wanted a night away. This place is a quick 2 hour drive from the cities with optional stops along the way to break up the drive. Definitely worth a visit!"

There were a couple of road closures on the way to the house, but Bethany called me way before hand to give us turn by turn directions. The house and environs are perfect. So much so that we were going to rearrange our trip so we could stay another day, but it ended up raining the next day so we stuck with our original plan and only stayed one night. We stayed here as our mid point in between DeSmet, South Dakota and Pepin, Wisconsin during a Laura Ingalls Wilder trip with our 2 kids. Our kids loved the little kitties that welcomed us to the Grainery. We would love to stay here again and check out the sights in the area."

The house and deck are just like the pics and it’s all sparkling clean, beautiful and looks brand new. The appliances and kitchen items were great as well - so was the gas grill! Great little touches like the coffee and even jigsaw puzzles! Book it - you won’t be disappointed!"
