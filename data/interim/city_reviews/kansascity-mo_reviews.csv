Stayed a few nights","Lynn’s place was the perfect setup for a BFF trip to Kansas City! We loved trying the coffees Lynn had for guests, sitting out on the deck and listening to birds singing in the morning, and being able to sleep soundly in our own rooms was a treat. Lynn was a really gracious hostess. I hope to be back with my family as this Airbnb feels like a sweet home away from home. ❤️"

There was a fire pit that was well stocked with wood and the kitchen had everything you could need. We loved the bathrobes and the disposable house slippers. The home was also spotless, easily one of the cleanest Airbnb we have ever stayed in. The neighborhood is cute and quiet with not a lot of noise around. We even saw six deer during one of our walks. Would recommend for anyone looking for a peaceful and clean stay."

I am looking forward to booking this place in the future.
We aren't very tech savvy and just assumed when I booked and sent a message we were traveling with our dog that our payments included it. My mistake, it did not. Lynn made it super easy to send a deposit with a click of a button."

Stayed with kids","Don’t hesitate to rent this cute house. Lynn has it set up for luxury. The beds are super comfortable, great linens and pillows too. The bath towels and robes are the softest I’ve ever felt. They provide more than enough of the basics, and then also go above and beyond with extras like laundry supplies, dog bowls and bed, snacks and drinks, two bottles of wine, a high chair, extra pillows, an abundance of coffee AND kpods, tvs in every room, a bedside fan, and even some things like slippers (disposable), extra toothpaste, dry shampoo, etc. They really got this right. We would 100% stay here again. If I chose two words to wrap this place up: comfort and luxury❤️"

Stayed a few nights","WHAT A LOVELY PLACE TO STAY! Home was comfortable, well-appointented, and spacious. PLENTY of room to enjoy space together and apart with others. Loved how it was decorated and calming colors. We didn't cook during our 2 days, but Lynn had everything available to cook if we wanted to - including a mixer and blender. She thought of everything. Will definitely stay again. Too bad it snowed so we couldn't sit on deck.
Porch out front is tall, and I misjudged steps for 80 yr. old mom with mobility issues (my bad). Did a workaround though. Went out back door and down a couple deck steps to gate/driveway. She loves the place and will want to stay again while in area.
If you are debating staying at a motel, do yourself a favor and stay here instead. For similar money, why stay at a motel with 2 queens and the only place to sit is on your bed or at a desk? Stretch out an enjoy yourself here. Pictures aren't angled to show place bigger than real life. It really is as spacious as it looks."

The room is perfect for a couple or maybe a family with 1 child/baby. We also had breakfast at Succotash (<1 min walk). Very good! I hope we get to come back again soon. I need to find out what they use on their floors. They were beautiful! Thanks again for a great stay!"

There is a nice breakfast / lunch place called Succotash literally around the corner. The neighborhood is mostly residential with single-family homes. It is quiet, and seems safe.
If you are healthy, it's about a 20-25 minute walk to Union Station (mostly downhill going to the station, uphill coming back).
Some may find the hike a little too long. Once you get to Union Station, you can get on the free trolley which runs the length of Main Street, through downtown, to the River Market at the other end, then loops back to the station."

A tremendous shower with excellent water pressure, and a comfortable bed. Grateful for snacks, oatmeal and all the appliances I needed for a multi-day visit. Moreover, I’ve never stayed in an Airbnb that offered such privacy— and yet the convenience of hosts nearby, if they are needed. What a wonderful neighborhood to walk around. Easy to catch a city bus or Uber to the museums, as many of them are very close and convenient. And as others have mentioned, the next-door Succotash restaurant is very fun and serves delicious breakfast food. A superb AirBnb experience. Hope to visit again some day."

Stayed one night","This was my third stay, and I really like this little unit.
Three comments that while not deal breakers for me, travelers need to know:
1. The shower is small. I am not much of a shower snob, but I do notice when it is hard to shave my legs.
2. The unit is on top of a garage. I am a hard sleeper who travels with white noise, and it still woke me. If you hope to lounge, cozy up, and stay in this may matter to me.
3. The unit has a number of stairs. Easy to traverse, just be prepared, particularly if you are differently-abled.
I think the pros outweigh any cons and I always check this unit first when I am booking. Enjoy your stay!"

Stayed a few nights","This was our first time in Kansas City and we were very pleased to stay at Kena's place. It was extremely hot the first day that we arrived and were glad to see numerous fans and a window unit to help alleviate it.
Everything was as it is pictured, and we felt right at home the 3 days we stayed the night. The bed was comfortable with plenty of pillows to choose from. I was worried when I saw the shower, but it is really not bad at all. It was a little warm in the bathroom, so we made sure to keep the door closed.
It was great to have to small refrigerator and microwave so we could warm up our leftovers at some of the amazing restaurants in Kansas City. We went to Minski's Pizza, Mildreds, Jack Stack BBQ, Succotash (next door), and The Antler Room for a ""fancy"" dinner (2 blocks away). We also enjoyed going to the farmer's market on Saturday and got some yummy food there as well.
I highly recommend Kena's place! It was centrally located to what we wanted to do."

Stayed one night","My husband and I only stayed here for a night, but we were very happy with this place, including it's location and ease of getting to downtown KC. It's exactly as it's described and was cozy and comfortable. There were plenty of fans to keep the cooler air from the A/C units going throughout the unit, which was wonderful for the muggy July weather. The bed was comfortable, towels and linens were soft and clean, and the unit was also very clean. A note to late sleepers: the garage door vibrates the bed when it's being opened & closed. We didn't notice it during the night, but it did wake us in the morning between 7:30 & 8. That was the time we were planning on waking up, so it wasn't an issue for us. We would recommend this place to others and would stay here again in the future."

Stayed a few nights","kena place was a deal. we booked the air bnb as we were coming into kc for a concert. i even messaged her the week of the concert to get recommendations on places to try. when we arrived, it was easy to get inside (after i struggled with the main gate because i didnt pull hard enough 😅). they had a very tidy place. the bathroom shower was a little small for my 6ft bf that we didn't realize till we got there and seen the size of it in person.
couple things to keep in mind if deciding to book with them. this place is as stated above a garage so you will occasionally hear the garage door open/close while laying in bed. I did enjoy how they recycled things. there is a brunch place literally right next to them and we didn't realize that till too late in our trip to visit."

The apartment was roomy, inviting and cozy. Plenty of space to unwind with a nice brick patio to enjoy a coffee from the easy to use coffee maker. The bathroom had plenty of amenities and a good hot shower after a long day outside was really appreciated. The bed was very comfortable. Pillows were a bit too soft for my liking but it didn't disturb my sleep. I'll definitely be staying here again when we come back next year."

We did have a few worries about temperature due to lack of central A/C, though the mounted units and fans provided did a great job. That being said, not sure if it would've been the same story had it not been overcast/raining most of the time All in all, we would happily stay here again."

The shower has great water pressure! You have access to a shared patio that is equally charming! This 1 bedroom apt is ideal for a single person or couple. The couch works fine for another adult or small children. We were in town for a relative who was having surgery at Children's Mercy, and this place is only a couple blocks away.

Stayed a few nights","A perfect location for two Kansas Citians pining to come home for a while, this little house located in the historic Hyde Park district--full of shirt-waist two-story houses--was perfect. Walkable to the world-class Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art and Gillham Park, and close enough for short drives to the Plaza, Brookside, Waldo, and other neighborhoods chocked full of great restaurants, this place was just the right size for us to relax on the deck, collapse at night and enjoy coffee of a morning on the porch. Moreover, this mini-cottage was fully appointed with anything a traveler could need. Much obliged."

We walked to the coffee shop on Troost and to the park just minutes away. Neighbors were friendly and the area has a nice vibe."

It sits way back on the property giving so much privacy from the street not that you need it. Convenient driving to West bottom and other areas. It seems everyone in Kansas City has a dog as they were walking a lot. This place made being stuck inside for most of the mid day sun worth it from the over 100° weather. Such a great stay. Would stay here every time I go to Kansas City in the future. Look no further- just book it. Especially if you have a pup!"

Stayed a few nights",My wife and I booked this space for a getaway trip to celebrate our anniversary. It was the perfect size for our stay and was a great location for us to experience KC. The bed was extra cozy and the space is set up really well for lounging after a long day of things to do. The experience you get for the cost of this stay is top notch value. We will be staying again and recommending this place to all our friends who visit!

There was no grab bar and I fell out of the tub onto the bathroom floor along with the shower curtain since the shower rod was not installed probably. Luckily I wasn’t seriously hurt, just bruised. I bought my own shower mat and found out that the water in the shower was lukewarm at best or down right cold. I received no response to my request for an early check in."

The house is set back from the road and very quiet - perfect for our dog that likes to announce everyone he sees. There is plenty of yard in front of the house for puppy potty breaks and we loved walking around and exploring the neighborhood with our pups. The house has a beautiful bath/shower and the kitchen and bathroom are very clean and have everything one could want. Kristen was so wonderful to work with as a host and responded very quickly anytime I had a question. The house has unique heating that kept us warm and cozy but the floors do get chilly - we really appreciated having our slippers and bringing our dog beds. Thank you, Kristen for keeping us Cozy in KC! We enjoyed our stay and hope to return!"

But other than that, this place is as advertised. A ""decent"" place. At the time of our stay there were only ""regular"" curtains in the master, so sleeping in would require you to ignore the AM sunlight or wear eye mask. Overall I would recommend this place if you only plan to use the 1 queen bed in the master."

Stayed one night","Boyfriend and I went on a staycation here and it was a wonderful experience! The apartment was easy to find and access. It was smaller than I expected, but still comfortable with great storage space. There were some great amenities like a blow dryer and desktop mirror, which were great for getting ready after I forgot my blowdryer. The bed was extremely comfortable and warm. The area is also one of my favorite in town, with Missy B’s right up the road and Westport around the corner; a great location for young out-of-towners! The only thing I was slightly irritated by and would say to keep in mind (which is a building thing, not a tenant issue) is the laundry unit uses tokens, not quarters, which can only be purchased from an in-wall coin machine that only takes $5, $10 and $20 bills. We had to run to the store to turn quarters into a $5, so make sure to have cash if you need to wash on-site."

Stayed a few nights","We loved the location of this little unit! With a little TLC, it will be a real gem - no doubt. We felt self. There wasn’t much street noise. The down side was that the pillows smelled bad, the towels smelled musty, the shower curtain liner was covered in pink mildew and the rugs were dirty. My husband and I always prefer white towels and sheets since they can be bleached after each guest and gets rid of any odor. Also, we were shocked to find the living room window had been left open (window level with the ground). We didn’t discover this until the following day."

Stayed a few nights","This little apartment in the Loretto was perfect for our stay. Great location, near multiple classic Kansas City neighborhoods, and very accessible. Although tiny, it included everything we needed to set up base camp as we visited friends and family throughout the weekend.
Our only hiccup was that the parking lot was easy to mix up, with another parking lot located on the west side of the building, but we eventually found it—which was a tremendous amenity for our trip.
Most importantly, Ashely was a great host and her communication was very helpful in making it a stress-free extended weekend stay."

She went above and beyond, patiently and graciously, to help me find a place with dates that matched what I needed.
I felt very welcome!
The apartment itself was centrally located, easy to get in and out of, and very clean. The wifi worked great for my meetings, and I was happy to have the kitchen there.
Would definitely return!"

I gave her like a hour notice 'I was running late as usual 😆. and she made sure everything' was kosher and the Loretto 'I think it was called 'was one of those old buildings that has character you ain't gonna find in the cookie cutter lofts that are built today...
when I come back to visit friends in Westport 'I'm definitely gonna get ahold of Ashley and see if a room is avaliable at the Loretto!...( sorry if I'm spelling it wrong)..

Stayed one night","This location was easy to find near Westport (but maybe not walkable at night). It's in a historic building with fantastic parking and easy entrance. I enjoyed the Halloween decorations and the ""condo"" vibe. Appreciate the 30 min. early checking to make a wedding! The apartment is on the ground floor - slightly below the front lawn, with two large windows looking out on the front road. When you walk in there is a small kitchen with microwave, Keurig coffee (thx!), and a living room. The bathroom and bedroom are normal size while the living room and kitchen are a bit smaller but entirely serviceable! It was set up and planned well. The entry numbers for the front door and then the other door worked well. We parked an additional care on the side street which was fine! Overall, I appreciate the rental, esp. on busy KC weekend. There is room to update the pillows, linens, and general cleanliness - not bad but could be better comparatively."

Stayed over a week","Ashley's place is located in a great area. Very walkable to great restaurants and bars. Centrally located. We are from the area and needed a place to stay while we transitioned to another living space.
Loretto feels very safe. Other people living or staying there are friendly. Nice little area outside for sitting and listening to the birds.
The apartment is small and located on the lower level. That being said, the windows are large. It is quiet in the apartment despite being located on a rather busy street. There is a dog area just outside the windows, which can be entertaining.
It was kind of small for us for a month long stay. I think that a single traveler of shorter stay would be perfect.
We did have a plumbing issue, but Ashley was responsive and it got taken care of the next day."

Stayed with a pet","This was such a neat place being built within an old historic building. The place was perfect for a long or quick trip. There are so many things to do within walking distance for entertainment and food. Ashley was a gem with super proactive checks to make sure everything was going great. The dog friendly enclosed area was clutch and even had dog bags available. It was a well kept nice and shady space. 100% a 5 star stay so this last bit is just to help the next fellow traveler. The laundry room only takes tokens and to get tokens the machine doesn't take less than a $5 so typically you're left with Chuckie Cheese tokens to take home😅. It really wasn't a big deal but be sure to take a couple of fives with you if you want to do laundry. I can't wait to visit again because this spot is definitely the bees knees. Oh yeah and the best part was there's a massage spa in the same building down the hall. Omg after driving 8 hours the day before ,made the cherry on top for my trip."

That was an interesting history that I'd like to have known when I booked. It wouldn't have kept me from booking, but I would have known what to expect rather than thinking it would be a house or residential apartment building. The area has a lot to offer, and we would have enjoyed the walkabout if it were warmer."

Should you stay there, take a moment to recline on the couch. The throw pillows are filled with magic and hugs! (It's the only way to describe them).
Love coffee?
There's a French press, and everything one needs to make a coffee worth waking up to.
Sooooo much better than the garbage given at hotels that run three times the price.
Full disclosure: The place has its quirks. All old spaces do. It only adds to the adventure.

Stayed a few nights","Stephen’s place was perfect for our stay in KC for a friends wedding. The airbnb was only a ten minute walk from the wedding venue and such a beautifully decorated space. The bed and bathroom were above and beyond. You can tell he takes very good care and wants to give you the best experience possible.
The location is very walkable to Crossroads and downtown KC, and there are several cute restaurants and cafes right around the corner. To get to museums and other parts of the city you’ll need to use public transport or an Uber— we opted for an Uber and it was always fast and not too expensive. Our only concern was that the space didn’t get super warm, which may be due to poor insulation. However we were mostly out and about so it didn’t affect us too much. We kept the curtain separating the space closed and that helped keep the heat in the bedroom area.
All in all the space was really lovely and we would definitely visit again. Great first time in KC! Thanks Stephen!"

We had everything we needed and when we had a question about the A/C, he was immediately responsive and helped us solve the issue. We were attending a show at the Kansas City Music Hall and were able to safely walk to avoid waiting for an Uber. We will be back!"

I’m very particular about bedding and it was comfy and cosy, no sweaty polyester sheets here, no no. It was cotton and feathers and luxury. Stephen knows quality and he’s not faking it here, it’s much better than the typical cookie cutter Airbnb that looks good but has no real heart and skimps on quality. Real deal hospitality! Would stay again in a heartbeat."

It was immaculately clean, smelled like a literal spa, the bed was so comfortable, and the design of the remodeled carriage house was stunning. It stayed nice and cool and the temperature on the split AC was adjustable.
I was a little worried about street parking as I’m moving across the country and didn’t want to unload my whole car, but as soon as I turned onto the street I was immediately comfortable. Such a cute, nice neighborhood and plenty of parking right in front. Walkable to lots of cafes but was still quiet and peaceful. I felt safe and secure as a young solo female traveler. I would 100% recommend this place."

It was within walking/biking distance to the wedding venue, friends, bars/breweries, restaurants, and wherever else we wanted to go! We also felt safe walking/biking back at night. There was enough room in the unit for us to easily keep our bicycles inside and out of the way. It was a lot of fun being able to leave the car behind and adventure at a slower pace.
The space itself was nice. We felt comfortable and at home. The decor was calming. The bed and pillows were comfortable. I forgot my pillow at home and was still able to sleep better than usual!!! (thanks for the comfy bed!) I liked the bathroom layout as well.
I think we’ll be in KC again this year, I’ll be on the lookout for this listing! =)"

From the initial email with extremely detailed and clear instructions on where to park (plenty of free street parking in a quiet, safe neighborhood), to how to get in to the unit (convenient lockbox meant I could check in and out at my convenience with description and pictures to make sure it went smoothly), to the unit itself (everything matched the description and was easily enough space for two people to stay comfortably with lots of thoughtful touches), to a number of recommendations on places to ear in the area, I was blown away by how easy the experience was. When you throw in the value component by comparing what you pay relative to any of the nearby hotels, it is easy to see why this place is booked so often.
I unfortunately do not have a lot of opportunities to go to KC, but the next time I do, I would gladly stay at Stephen’s place again!"

The apartment is located on the westside which is a super cute residential and urban-adjacent neighborhood near downtown. Very quiet with lovely restaurants nearby. Stephen has clearly put a great deal of time into cultivating a comfy peaceful and modest space for individuals and couples. There were cozy blankets to use if necessary. A split AC unit above the bed to warm things up or vice versa. Lovely modern wood furnishings. A spacious shower and bathroom. Not to mention Stephen was very accommodating and communicative. Would definitely recommend.

Stayed with a pet","My family (including myself, husband and 2 dogs) stayed here for 2 nights while we were in town for a concert and visit with friends. We loved the space so much, and even our extremely nervous big dog felt right at home in the house. There was plenty of space to spread out, and the yard was great for the dogs to run around in. We enjoyed one night just hanging out in the yard with the lovely lights on. It was so quiet and peaceful and felt so far away from the city, but in reality it's very convenient to the city and all you may want to do. We'll definitely stay here again when we make our way back to KC."

The green house was located in a very quaint and inviting neighborhood, walking distance from cool spots like KC bier CO and sunny side park and it was a couple min. Drive to shops like Target and Trader Joe’s. We found it very easy to travel everywhere we were headed.The house was clean, well decorated, and very accommodating. The kitchen was well stocked, the coffee bar was a very appreciated addition, and the appliances were all very clean and user friendly. The TVs all had streaming services set up and ready to use. The house offered strong WiFi connection and easy to use laundry. The toddler really enjoyed hanging in the huge and very clean backyard yard which had a nice patio set that offered great shade! The master bedroom had a cute back deck that we enjoyed our coffee on! The host supplied a welcome binder that suggested some awesome things to check out. Will 100% stay again!"

Stayed with kids","We loved the house. The decor was relaxing and the floorpan was spacious and welcoming. It was nice having the dedicated workspace and the backyard was lovely on the cooler evenings when we were able to use it. The kitchen was well-appointed, and we basically had everything we needed to get started (except cooking oil-- this would be a nice thing to have for future guests). We also appreciated greatly that Connor was able to accommodate us one day earlier on very short notice-- that meant a lot to us! On the negative side, we had some issues with dust and pet hair in the rugs, sofa, and linens. It would be great if there could be deeper cleaning between guests. There were also issues with lighting in the basement where the laundry area was located- it was unwelcoming and hard to see. The king bed in the larger bedroom seemed to sag a bit. Otherwise, we made some good memories while staying in the Green House, and it was a truly lovely home and neighborhood."

Fully stocked coffee and tea station, extra poop bags for dogs (which I forgot), fenced in backyard, comfortable beds with plenty of pillows, free Netflix, desk workstation in a sunroom. I would love to stay here again."

The beds were super comfortable, no back pain!!! Everything was clean and nicely decorated. Connor and Ashley had very clear and reasonable rules/instructions that made checking in and out very simple. Plus, it is very close to everything you need. We will definitely stay here every time we visit our kids on KC!!"

The only thing we would change is better curtains on the door to the porch in the main bedroom. It was really bright in the morning for these two not-so-morning people. I’m sure it wouldn’t be a problem for most.
We would definitely stay here again if we came back!"

They provided us with a booklet with recommendations near and far plus plenty of coffee to get us going in the morning! We LOVED how close it was to amenities: great restaurants, convenience stores for groceries, shopping, and a quick drive to the Crown Center/Union Station district and surrounding areas. The side office was nice to do work in as I work from home and the WiFi was fast. Our dog enjoyed the spacious back yard as did we! The neighborhood is quiet and picture perfect with beautiful homes around each corner. We'll definitely be booking the Green House again on our next stay in KCMO!"

Stayed a few nights","Where do I start,
I’ve been to KC more than a few dozen times and honestly Connor’s airbnb is phenomenal. The location in my opinion was fairly close to all the places I usually visit, the location was quiet and quaint. Checking in was easy and I had no trouble with anything while staying there. The fact that we were also able to bring our dog to the airbnb was also perfect. The accommodations for our dog was so sweet and thoughtful for an airbnb to even think about. On top of that, the backyard was very spacious and nice to sit out on when it’s not too cold. I loved the design and just the feel of the house, everything was so modern and boho yet minimal. The king size bed was also very comfortable and just has a very cuddly sense to it hahah. We unfortunately didn’t have anyone stay in the other bedroom but the bed looked just as comfortable as well! Literally, OBSESSED. There was also toiletries and extra towels for us to use in case we needed it, which i find it being rare. We did not have any issues with parking since the house has a long driveway. Connor was also easy to get ahold of and responded fairly quick. I’m 99.9% positive I will be staying here now whenever I come back to KC.
I would highly recommend staying here for anyone who is wanting to visit KC."

What makes this place great is the aesthetic of the space, the neighborhood, and the experiential touches (the diffuser/smell inside). The hosts got the balance right between beautiful minimalist design and utility. I was in town for a wedding and coming back to this space at the end of night was a real treat. In morning, you can enjoy the patio which overlooks the union cemetery…perfect for birding. Each morning I was also able to walk down the hill grab coffee at the Filling Station coffee shop and check out the beautiful homes and gardens in the neighborhood. One of my favorite discoveries was finding the local PBS station only two blocks away, which prompted me to listen once I return via the Alexa device. I can’t recommend this place enough and can’t wait to return. Thank you so much!!"

The space feels so zen and inviting. The couch was so comfortable, I could have slept on it, but the bed was top-notch. Not just a comfortable mattress, but the linens were soft. I slept so well! The kitchenette was perfect for my needs, but I can’t see doing much cooking here. There was an ample fridge to store drinks and fruit for snacking, and plenty of dishes were stocked in the cabinets. The view of the cemetery is peaceful during the day with so many trees and people walking their dogs. At night, the skyline of downtown KC is beautiful. All in all, I highly recommend this space for a serene retreat. The hosts have paid attention to the details that really matter for comfort."

The living room overlooked a lovely green space, even though you were in a big city. You were just minutes away from downtown Westport and the power and light district. The bed was super comfy, and all of the amenities were provided. We would gladly stay here again."

The decor was just gorgeous, and everything was easy and clear. Stay here!"

Stayed a few nights","Beautiful and quiet space in Union Hill. Overall bedroom, bathroom and living space are very welcoming. Interesting layout for the kitchen and utility spaces. Not a full kitchen meaning no stove/oven, but a two burner cooktop in a drawer as well as the toaster and very small basic microwave also in drawers in the utility area you have to find and set out. Not a huge deal, but one does make trips back and forth around a wall to the trash can, toaster, microwave and back to the kitchen space. Bedroom built in drawers are nice; however, space for hanging clothes is out of reach for shorter folks up over the built in drawers and the hanging height is not really enough for clothes to hang properly. Be ready for the robot vacuum unit that goes into action for an hour at 9am. I would certainly recommend this brand new space for the location and serene north view out the back window to the Union Hill Cemetery and beyond!"

There’s a pull down drying rack in the laundry room as well as different types of detergent. There is a well stocked tea drawer! The two mini split units equate to having two different HVAC zones. The bathroom even has lens solution and there are two bathrobes. Add in the fact the place is spotless, quiet and looks brand new. It is also tastefully decorated and there’s lots of natural light. I hope to stay again when I come back for one of my future work trips here. Thank you!"

The bed/bedding was SUPER comfortable and we actually loved the view (check the listing pics LOL). Mabry was very responsive and came quickly to shovel the snow off the steps. Speaking of the steps, there is a flight of steps to get up to the space as it’s over the garage. They’re well lit and private but just keep that in mind. Only draw back is there isn’t a full length mirror so if you’re planning to get fancy for a night on the town, plan ahead. If you’re thinking about booking- do it!!"

The carriage house is actually way better than the photos. It feels so cozy and relaxing. The bed and couch are comfortable, the decor is modern and warm. It's stocked with nearly everything you'd need. Despite being in the city, it's mostly a quiet area. After long days out, returning to the Air Bnb felt like returning home. It really is a vibe, y'all! Don't pass it up!"

Stayed a few nights","If you’re into comfort and designer living, this is one of the best — if not the best — single unit Airbnb in midtown KC (I’ve stayed at many over the year as a constant visitor.) It’s brand new construction in a very central location, and is designed and furnished straight out of a Dwell magazine spread. The view out the back window is magical, making it easy to forget you’re in the middle of a major metro.
Walking distance to pubs, coffee, restaurants, parks, trails, Costco and the soon-to-be new street car line (opening 2025).
Mabry was a great host and very responsive to a couple issues that arose.
I cannot recommend more highly."

Stayed a few nights","first I will say that Auguste was very attentive and always responsive! he quickly answered any question I had and was friendly. if you don't mind the next few things this is a good place to stay. first, he was awkwardly curious about who all was coming with me. I realized once I checked in, it was because he has ""a rule"" that a fee of $31 must be added for each person over 2 people. maybe I missed this while booking but as far as I knew he has his place stated as a 2 bedroom suitable for 5 ppl. I don't see how you could charge extra for ppl unless it i had 6+? lastly, as many others have stated in their reviews, the back room is small and a bit awkward with slanted ceilings. that was expected and a non issue but more importantly there is no window. therefore no known egress. there is an AC/heater unit in the far wall that in an emergency could be removed but if you are not aware, or unable to fit through this opening, I worry someone could get stuck in that room during an emergency."

This is a great location if, like I, you are attending a conference at the Crown Centre and are looking for alternate accommodations. A 15 or so minute walk.
I would definitely recommend this spot for an individual or a family. The layout is such that you don't have a ton of privacy in the bathroom, but that should not be an issue if people are family.
I don't imagine I'll ever be back to KC, but if I did, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."

Complete kitchen even though i did not use it. After check-in I noticed the internet speeds were horrible. I called Auguste and he took care of it right away. He upgraded the internet with his provider over the phone and then i could enjoy blazing fast internet speeds to work and stream. One word of caution is to watch your head if you are tall. Being 6'5"" I bumped my head one time but that was all it took to remember to duck. Auguste was also pleased to recommend restaurants and sights to see that are within walking distance of the house."

Stayed a few nights","Within an easy bus ride to the convention center. I left my car, or could’ve rather at the air bnb in the driveway. The street parking is only on weekends, but I mostly picked this place because of the location and it allowed my friends to get ready for downtown Kansas City and pregame somewhere close and safe as well. It was overall an enjoyable experience. However if you are over 6” tall you might have a little bit of trouble not hitting your head in the slanted areas. I’m 6 exactly and hit my head once, but I feel like that’s more my fault than anything else."

If climbing stairs is a problem this isn’t the place for you as you need to go up a fairly long outdoor stairway to get to this second floor rental. The Airbnb was very quiet except for the occasional ambulance sirens going to the nearby hospitals. Overall I wouldn’t hesitate to stay at Auguste’s place again."

Stayed a few nights","Auguste's place was the perfect place for my stay. I loved the feeling how quiet the place was. Once I walked back to the back of the house, it felt like my own private little getaway. The place was quiet and I enjoyed sitting in the porch on my breaks from school. The bathroom was nice with a skylight, and everything I needed. One word of caution. if you leave the house with the bathroom doors closed, when you come back it will be very hot in the bathroom, but nothing that wasn't solved by leaving the doors open. The bigger bedroom was fantastic, there were no windows so it was quiet and dark. perfect for a good night's sleep (and even a mid day nap). I was in KC for a compus visit in thr school if nursing and the location was perfect. literally a 1 min drive. I definitely could have walked, but I am typically running late fir everything. The driveway was nice, just make sure you don't pull too far in. once you get past the porch it is very narrow and I banged the doors of my rental more times than I care to admit. I will definitely check out the availability for this place again when I graduate in May!"

Stayed one night","Lots of pros to this nice place! Great location, very quiet street, super clean, nicely outfitted, comfortable beds, spacious tub/shower, good hot water, well outfitted kitchen, nice table to eat outside, and everything just as described. Auguste is also an outstanding host - fast and clear communication, and very generous when we needed some flexibility. A few reviews mention the ceilings, which I had wondered about, so here's the scoop: this apartment is at the top of the house, which means nice character and great light (but good blinds, so don't worry about sleeping!), and also some angled ceilings because of the roofline. Importantly, the only person this affects is whoever sleeps on the far side (away from the bathroom) of the larger bedroom. This person (even if they aren't tall) will need to bend over to go around the foot of the bed and on their side - a bit awkward and if you get up a lot at night might be a problem. Nonetheless, so many good things about this place that you should definitely consider it!"

The apartment was nice and clean, though know taller people might have trouble with the lower/slanted ceilings. It is very much a loft in this sense.
Also, it was nice to have a driveway to park in and not the street. Just know that it's a little tight.
The toilet was a little loud at times, a minor inconvenience.
There was something that could have been mold in the vents of the window units. Auguste was very appreciative of being informed of this and always responded to us kindly and quickly.
The apartment had quite new furnishings and was well kept.
We're altogether quite pleased with our visit and had a good time in KC!"

Stayed a few nights","This lovely loft apartment was ideal - from its location to the beautifully decorated space - for our time in Kansas City. It's nestled in a quiet neighborhood just 10 minutes from the heart of city. Communication with Auguste was perfect from the time we booked our stay until our departure. My husband and I highly recommend this clean, safe, cozy loft for anyone looking to spend time in Kansas City."

Stayed one night","Perfect location for our trip. Easy offstreet parking, coffee, clean, and surprisingly secluded. Lovely deck, feel like you're in the woods. Auguste was very communicative, and accommodated us with an early check-in when requested. We'd stay there again"

Stayed one night",This is great loft apartment! It is very clean with good amenities and comfortable beds. It has parking off the street which is another bonus. Definitely would recommend this place for a stay in the downtown KC area. The host was very helpful and responsive.

Stayed a few nights",This plan is exactly how advertised. There was a slight AC issue during our stay and the host went out of the way to resolve it. Then followed up on a daily basis to be sure we were comfortable. Would stay here again.

Stayed a few nights","Great location, comfortable and updated spaces, very clean. Safe neighborhood easy walk to many attractions along with an off street parking spot. Try the free KC street car at Union Station.
Hint- Check websites of local attractions for tickets needed for some of the free sites for timed entry during Covid. Boulevard Brewing is fun tour. Home is lovely with all amenities needed. Communication with host was great too!"

Stayed a few nights",I stayed at this Airbnb for my Bachelor Party during Irish Fest and the Uncorked wine fest. The hosts were very accommodating for me and the groomsmen. The loft was very clean and spacious. 10 out of 10. Would Airbnb again.

Stayed a few nights",Auguste was a great host. He responded to messages in a timely manner and was super friendly. The location was great because I could walk to different restaurants at the end of my day. I'd definitely stay here again next time I'm in town.

Stayed a few nights","The loft is a great place to stay. This is my second time staying here and Auguste has made some great upgrades since the last time I visited. Spacious and comfortable. Only draw back...and I think I said this before, stairs to get to the loft (which makes sense cause it's a loft and I'm just lazy... hahaha). Great area and cool restaurants within walking distance!"

Stayed a few nights","Auguste was a great host, very easy to communicate with and quick to respond when needed. Check in was very easy and all rules were very clearly stated both on the listing and in the home. The Airbnb looks exactly like the photos. It was very clean and felt very welcoming. There are some areas in the home with slanted ceilings, it was easy for my 6ft partner to avoid them, but tall people should be aware of this just in case. The neighborhood was easy to navigate and easy to get to other activities. There is a great little breakfast/brunch spot about a 2 minute walk right down the street. We had no issues in the Airbnb or the neighborhood during our stay. We would absolutely stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","Great stay! The location is great, only a few minutes away from downtown. There are restaurants within walking distance. We found a great place only 2 minutes away called Succotash. The apartment is comfortable and triple and has a nice home like feel with a full kitchen. The only downside of our stay is that we were experiencing 90°+ temperatures, and since the apartment is located in the upstairs/attic, the air conditioning struggled to keep the heat down. There was a oscillating fan in the bedroom, which helped."

Auguste's place was also very comfortable, very clean and in a nice, quiet neighborhood. Highly recommended and if/when I'm back in Kansas City I'll definitely be staying there again."

We were also able to use the washer and dryer each night after sports games. We would definitely stay here again if we return to Kansas City."
