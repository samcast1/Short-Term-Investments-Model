Stayed a few nights","Carolyn and her husband have been amazing to us. They're very attentive, responsive, and welcoming. Their place is nice and tidy and has everything you need just like you would in your own home (all the snacks and 2 beautiful pups you get to see were an added bonus!) Everything was as described and the neighborhood was nice and quiet. If you're looking for a stay in the area, I would definitely recommend their place.
Thank you again, Carolyn! ☺️"

Stayed a few nights","Walking into the house was like going into the manor house in ""Downton Abbey"". Beautiful and comfortable furniture and decorations. The kitchen was large and bright. There was a coffee bar with the best selection of coffee and flavorings we had ever seen. The appliances were clean and working properly. The basement ""apartment"" was warm and clean with a sitting area, fireplace, big screen TV and very comfortable furnishings. Adjacent to the sitting area was a bedroom that was nice and cozy and a large bath area with shower. The bedrooms were large with plenty of closets and comfortable beds. The master bedroom had two easy chairs and a big screen TV. Outside was a large patio area with plenty of sitting area. There was an entry vestibule with an electric fireplace and two very comfortable chairs. The house was large and secure we loved it. We made e reservation for Thanksgiving almost as soon as we arrived there. Thank you Barbara."

Stayed a few nights",We met Kellie and her husband right away because we accidentally turned into the wrong driveway. They were extremely friendly. We found the rental to be even better than expected. Very clean and smelled so nice. Kellie had thought of everything. It is located outside of town which made it so quiet. She and her husband told us that the cicadas had arrived. We actually enjoyed listening to them. But the rental is so tight that we never heard them inside. The bed was soooooo comfortable. We made the decision to always stay there if it’s available when we visit Paragould. We stayed three nights.

I would recommend staying away from Ikura Japanese restaurant though unless you like sushi with bones in it. Responsive host. Google maps stops at her driveway though and not the Air BnB driveway so it was a little confusing and so is the key pad. Overall enjoyed the house and world recommend.

We don't know how to use the streaming TV (old people who have cable) so I sent Kellie a message & she came right over. She couldn'tget it to work either so she flagged her husband down as he was mowing the yard. He was just finishing so came right over & got it working. He made sure we knew how to turn it on and get the stations we wanted. They are a very sweet couple. We will be back!

My only real problem is that the driveway is a bigger deal than the listing makes it sound like. Small vehicles would have trouble. I was in a Yukon XL. A VERY large SUV, and the length meant that I scraped when pulling out unless I cut the tires very sharply.
Nice place and convenient! Taxi’s run in this area with enough heads up."

I cooked all my meals in the full kitchen. All pots, pans, plates, cups and utensils provided, just bring your own food and oil for cooking. Walmart and Aldi nearby if you forget anything. Visited Crowley Ridge State Park (only 15 minutes away) and ambled down a couple short hiking trails. The hosts are very friendly, respond promptly, and give you your privacy while making it clear that they’re happy to help if you need anything. I would be happy to stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","The property was as pictured and as described - very pretty, with calming colors and nice decor. Kristin is super responsive.
Bloomfield is a nice little town, and host provided recommendations for dining and other activities. While options in Bloomfield are limited, nearby Dexter has more options. Sikeston is within about 1/2 hour. We enjoyed the nearby town square and all the historical markers. Our reason for staying in Bloomfield was to visit the Stars & Stripes Museum, and for that, this was a perfect location.
Our only issues keeping me from giving it 5 stars are that the housekeeping person didn’t re-stock some items needed (we expected to have toilet paper and coffee for 2 people for 2 nights) and we had to work around a leaking bathroom sink - Kristin offered to call a plumber right away but didn’t want to inconvenience us by making us wait around when we had plans for the day. A stop on both ends of the barn door rail to keep it from sliding off would be helpful."

Stayed a few nights","What a gem in Bloomfield! It looks AND feels like the interior of a Pottery Barn store!!! We were in town for a family wedding. I work remotely and this was the perfect place to work during the week: quiet,swanky, fast & reliable internet, plenty of air conditioning, plenty of workspace, and a large fridge. I got a lot done in our 4-5 days staying there - even my laundry! Kristin was wonderful! She was quick to respond to all of our questions - even BEFORE we made a reservation (and a reservation on short notice at that).
This is a gem and it will certainly be our “go-to” from now on when we visit family in Bloomfield. We highly recommend the stay, it’s worth every penny. Bravo!!

The home is decorated in a modern boho theme throughout . You can definitely tell how much time and effort Kristin took to make sure your stay is as comfortable as possible. From the second you walk in the front door to the moment your sipping coffee on the back porch you feel that warm and cozy at home feeling! The home is well equipped with everything you need. We would definitely stay again . Thank You again Kristin for making our stay so wonderful during a chaotic time.

Stayed about a week","We flew into the area from overseas for a family funeral. We picked this house because we needed a comfortable place to stay and be at a fairly close distance to surrounding towns. Grandma’s house was a great place to stay because it was spacious, comfortable, we were able to cook since the kitchen is very well stocked with pots, pans, utensils, bowls and everything else needed. We really enjoyed having all the different rooms. Separate bedrooms with very comfy beds, eat in kitchen area and separate dining area for our game nights. And the backroom with darts, and sleeper sofa’s and another full bathroom came in handy as well. Laundry room was a life saver. The parking was great. The area was peaceful and quiet.
The closets, laundryroom and kitchen cabinets were cluttered and unorganized but we had everything we needed and more so I would stay here again if in the area. It truly is a Grandma’s House and grateful it was available for us for a week. It surely beats a hotelroom."

Stayed with kids","Grandma's house is appropriately named! As soon as I walked in, I felt like I had entered my mamaw's home from the decor to the toiletries in the bathroom (especially the Jergen's handlotion, my grandmother always had this on hand!). With that said, there was a very strong musky odor that was quite overwhelming our first night in the home. My father-in-law turned on all the ceiling fans when he arrived to try and get air moving around the house, and by the second evening it did seem to dissipate some. I had not read anything about this in other reviews, so did share feedback with the owner and he provided some context for what may have caused it. Hopefully this would not be a problem for others in the future. As for cleanliness, overall it was reasonable. I did notice some small things (dust, food in fridge, hair on the floor in a room or two). There was plenty of space for our family of 6, really convenient for the funeral we came to attend, and more value than $ of two hotel rooms."

She was so kind about allowing us to book later in the evening/sam day and provided very specific directions for how to find the house. We did not have any trouble getting here whatsoever. Sara has lots of candy, snacks, and drinks provided in the cabin that make it feel cozy and welcoming. I truly have nothing to complain about with this cabin. If we are ever in this area again, we will be sure to book this sunroom. A million times better, safer, and cleaner than a hotel room."

Stayed one night","Pros: the check in is convenient, the dogs are cute, the outdoor area is nice, it’s clean, and it has all the essentials (plus some treats which is nice). Cons: It was freezing when I came in, to the point I sat in my car for 30 minutes to wait for it to warm up. (The heater does work fine once it’s been turned on for awhile, I ended up cozy). I’m not certain if the value is there considering hotels in the area go for the same price or cheaper. (I don’t intend to be harsh on the hosts, I’m still giving 5 stars. this is just my honest review for fellow travelers)"

Stayed with a pet","The host was very responsive, considering we made a last-minute reservation due to issues with another Airbnb host. The room was very clean and stocked with lots of candy and soda and water. The home is a little out-of-the-way, so it wasn’t super convenient to get to, but we found it just fine. The host has two very friendly dogs that stay outside and during the night they woke us up a few times barking which meant we didn’t get as much sleep as we were hoping for. Also, there are two large windows in the room that don’t have any shades, which meant we couldn’t sleep in because it got so bright in the room. Other than that, everything was fine. The host was very friendly and responsive. I think it would be great for someone who isn’t a light sleeper like myself."

The pond and patio were fun to spend time on. We saw rabbits, frogs, the catfish feeding routine and enjoyed petting their great perinese dogs.

The place is nicely decorated, and cute. She made sure everything we may need was stocked and in good taste. Beautiful country scenery. The fur babies were an added addition, however, very very well mannered! There were treats left so that if we wanted to make friends with the pups, we could. Again, they were very mannered. Check out was super easy, just a quick message to let her know we’ve gone. We hope to revisit this place and enjoy the amities we weren’t able to during our stay due to the weather."

Stayed a few nights","The Sunroom is great; exactly what I was looking for. It's somewhat secluded and very peaceful. It's exactly as described and very clean. I especially enjoyed the deep soaker tub (something hotels rarely have) for easing aching muscles. The patio is really nice, and if you want a small fire just walk across the road and use the fire pit/ring next to the pond. I didn't think about it at the time, but I suppose you could build a small fire and roast a few hotdogs and/or marshmallows. The pond is full of catfish and you can feed them or try to catch some from the dock with the included fishing gear (I preferred to just feed them). The Sunroom is just a few minutes from visiting friends/family, shopping, dining, entertainment and Reynold's Park (I think that's still the name) which can be accessed by at least two directions (I used both). Overall, a very pleasant experience and one I recommend."

Just my wife and myself were in our party. The Sunroom is not huge but plenty of space for two people that like each other or a couple with one or two children. Spotless, squeaky clean with all amenities and plenty of extras (Keurig coffee maker, soft drinks in the fridge, breakfast food, and a truck full of sweets). Extremely well constructed with a well thought out floor plan, efficient use of space, and a very interesting and tasteful decor. PEACEFUL AND QUIET which is what we were looking for after a long drive from Houston. Clear, timely and friendly communication from Sarah. Everything top notch. Would stay again in a heartbeat if available on our next trip.
Thanks for a great stay. We truly appreciate the effort.

Loved it it was so cute and the interior design as cute. Wouldn’t recommend bringing frozen food it’s got a compartment abt big enough for an ice tray but not for frozen food. Host were very friendly and helpful. My large dog love all the land and my small one loved to bask in the sun 10/10 would recommend for couples who appreciate peace and quiet and nature. Only abt 10 mins from a gas station and Walmart along with some other restaurants.lovely place !

Stayed a few nights","Several aspects of this rental didn’t meet expectations, and I offer the following comments in a constructive spirit in hopes that conditions improve as a result. I would have expressed them directly to Sarah, but she was out of town. (In fact, I saw no one at all on the premises for the entirety of my stay.) First off, the positives: The remote setting is peaceful and quiet; even the very inquisitive, super affectionate resident dogs were –thankfully– “bark free”. The compact rental unit was tidy (with the exception of the toilet bowl, which was streaked and obviously had not been cleaned, and a bucket littered with cigarette butts between the two patio chairs on the small outdoor seating area next to the front door). The Keurig capsule coffee machine was in fine working order, but most other aspects of the kitchenette were sadly deficient. Here is an inventory: There was no flatware or eating implements save for a small wicker basket with plastic forks and spoons – no knife of any sort. The drawer labeled “Utensils” contained only scissors and one plastic spoon. No bottle opener or corkscrew. No bowls at all, no plates except for small and flimsy paper plates and a few larger plastic ones that warped and cracked when heating up take-out food in the microwave. For drinking, there was a solitary tall water glass (but four coffee mugs). Some of the missing elements were puzzling: Breakfast cereal and milk were provided, but there were no bowls. Is the guest supposed to use a coffee mug and a plastic spoon to eat the cereal? The small kitchen sink did have dish soap, but no sponge or dish towel. In other respects, there were no hooks to hang clothing or wet items (rather awkward given the heavy rains on both days of my stay), although the unit was adorned with several Christian crosses inscribed with Bible verses. The only potential clothes storage options were a heavy metal bar with one hanger perched precariously under the AC unit and directly above the bed; there was a bureau at the foot of the bed, but the top three drawers were stuffed with extra bedding. As to the bed itself, the mattress was adequate, but the all-polyester sheets were uncomfortable, and the bottom sheet was riddled with pilling. Finally, the Wi-Fi signal was weak (the router must have been in the main house next door): It worked, albeit quite slowly, on my iPad, but not at all on my PC laptop. If Sarah opts to resolve these issues, The Sunroom would be a much more satisfying retreat space."

Stayed one night",The Sunroom was the perfect stay after a long day of driving. Incredibly clean and decorated to perfection. Sarah was an excellent host and very communicative. We had everything we needed and I enjoyed sipping coffee on the swing overlooking the pond in the morning. We would definitely stay here again!

Will definitely stay here again and recommend enthusiastically."

There is a place to park right next to the door and the dogs are very friendly (Hi Willie!). And it is very quiet and serene. I wish I had been able to stay longer. I look forward to coming back.

Stayed one night","We love coming to stay at Sarah's Place! This is our third trip. The accommodations are quiet and comfortable, and we sleep SO well in the absolute peace. Our old dog (16.5 y/o) loves to roam around the yard and play with Willie, the canine Airbnb host. Our gracious (human) hosts also gave us apples to feed the horses and there is food to feed the fish in the pond. Paragould is a neat town with lots to offer and we are so glad we found this location. Whether you are traveling with dogs, or looking for some peace, quiet, and calm, you will feel right at home here."

She was particularly helpful on our last trip as I broke 3 bones in my foot the day before we were due to arrive. She helped me navigate through a cancellation and rebooking excellently. And I'm also happy to say her location is very handicap accessible! Paragould is a delightful town with lots of food options. Our dogs felt welcome and pampered and we were even given apples to feed the horses on-site. If you are in the area, you couldn't do better than with Sarah."

If you like animals, nature, and clean modern styling, this is the place for you. Sarah was around with a warm smile for anything we needed, but provided us plenty of privacy and space. They even gave us apples to feed the horses; it really made the trip for me. My son caught a catfish from the pond on his first cast with the extra bait they provided. I am sure we will all have fond memories for all our lifetimes. Thank you so much!"

Plenty of space for our dogs to roam/be walked safely. An outside sitting area, fridge, microwave and kitchen amenities. A quick 12 minute drive to town. I couldn't ask for anything more and plan to stay again as we return home from our journey. The host(s) was quick to respond to all my inquiries and was a pleasure to meet. Whether you are traveling with dogs, or just want a quiet get-away, this is your place."

The studio apartment is on the side of the house and private. It looks modern, cozy and new. Amazing views. Outstanding hospitality as there is even sodas and snacks! Best part that my dog was able to be off leash and played all day with their puppies!! He had the best time ever. Lovely spot highly recommended to be away and enjoy nature and peace."

Stayed with kids","Sarah was on it with communication! We came in at 1am after driving all evening with our 4 yr old and 14 week old pup, Thor(soon to be service pup!) to a WELL lit up outside and the lights on inside! It smelled nice, it’s newly renovated, clean, simple but all the necessities! Bed was comfy and it was quiet.
After a walk around the pond we met some of the family pups and they were all well behaved, friendly and wanted belly rubs! Thor got to make some friends before we got back on the road!
Finding these little gems have made our road trips even better!
*Next time we know to bring our poles for the stocked pond!"

Stayed one night",The Sunroom is a very cute little guest house right by a pond. My husband and I enjoyed getting to feed the fish in the pond before having dinner. Bonus points for us was that papa johns delivers to the guest house. After driving all day it was nice to not have to do anything extra for food. The guest house itself was very cozy and the windows provide lots of natural light (my favorite). The kitchenette was stocked with snacks and lots of drinks and coffee options. The bathroom was also stocked with essentials and the water was nice and hot! The hosts were so nice and love dogs! They were very kind to my poodle. They are also very responsive to messages! Wish I could have stayed longer.

Stayed a few nights",I cannot express how wonderful this home is! Upon arrival we were greeted with warm & welcoming smiles & shown the amazing property. The front porch was where we spent a lot of our time enjoying the privacy & beauty of land. There’s an amazing porch swing & 2 TVs to enjoy while relaxing out front as well. The outdoor area is a beautiful park like setting & very well maintained. There’s a private stocked pond available for fishing which our family thoroughly enjoyed during our stay. The pictures online do not compare to seeing it in person. Home sits just behind a well maintained ranch which had miniature horses & other animals. During fishing we were greeted by them & had so much fun interacting with them. This home is absolutely amazing & so tastefully decorated for a true county cabin theme. Extremely clean & wonderful amenities inside. The huge open area shower was so relaxing & the smart toilet was an added bonus! PERFECT!! We will definitely be returning & highly recommend!!

This is a beautiful, warm and welcoming place to stay. The attention to detail in the aesthetics was mind blowing. You have absolutely EVERYTHING you need to stay here in a beautiful, homey comfortable setting. I VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND should you be looking for a place to stay in Piggot. TOP NOTCH. Probably the best rental I've ever stayed at - EVER.

I have stayed at 2 of Karen’s homes and I believe the hostess is part of what has made my stays with her amazing.
But this country cottage gem… I never wanted to leave. It’s so full of character, charm, and heart.
Absolutely one of the best hosted I have ever encountered and by far one of my most favorite AirBnb’s… I will never chose a different place to stay when I come visit family."

You’ll hear a little road noise from cars and trucks going by, but we didn’t find it annoying because it tapered off significantly towards evening.
We really liked the setting - it’s surrounded by working farms. It’s very private, with a really cute gazebo to enjoy.
Karen was super helpful and very informative as we peppered her with questions about the area.
