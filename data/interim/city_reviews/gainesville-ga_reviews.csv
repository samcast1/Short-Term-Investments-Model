Stayed with kids","We had a really good experience with our 2-night stay. Breanna was extremely flexible when we needed to change our travel dates, and this house is in a wonderful and easily accessible part of Gainesville with plenty of access to walking areas and parks/recreational options. We were traveling with some elderly family, so we were extremely appreciative of the numerous handicap-accessible features like handlebars and grips in the bathrooms and some other rooms. The neighborhood was quiet, and parking was sufficient.
The main downside for us, since we also were traveling with small children, was the lack of a real bathtub for their bathtime. There is a master bath with a shower (plenty of hot water!) and a main bath with a walk-in tub, so it would work well for some people but did not match the pictures we saw of a real, normal tub. If you have small children, just ensure they are good in the shower. Overall, we fully recommend Breanna’s place, and we would stay there again."

Stayed one night","A/C issues. We booked this place for a one night stay to attend a graduation. Place was very clean and easy to get too. Inside furnishings were comfortable. We came back to house around 10 pm A/C was set on 74. It was 79 in the house. Outside fan unit was running but no airflow inside. Texted the host at about 10:30pm to let them know it was not working and never received a reply. We knew it was late however, we never heard anything from them the next day or anytime after our stay. At over $200 for the night this wasn’t a great deal."

Kitchen was a bit sticky and things were half hazardly thrown in cupboards when I arrived, didn’t have a toaster so I had to buy one for my month long stay. I left it- so there’s a toaster now. The showers spray water outside of the shower but other than that, they get the job done. All in all a nice stay for the month!"

This was my favorite property we have stayed at in the area. It’s close to coffee shops, restaurants, bars, and cute shops. The home is large and laid out perfectly. I wish it hadn’t been so cold because I would have loved to sit outside in the back yard. Great place!"

Stayed a few nights",This is the first time I've stayed in an AirBnB. It was easy to check in and the place was clean. The home was interesting to stay in due to it's age and feel. It was in good condition. There were some drinks left in the refrigerator and coffee pods next to the coffee machine we used during our stay but it would have been nice if there was a placard in the kitchen stating if we could or any other minor information for the house or the surrounding area. The main bathroom shower next to the king bedroom was very small and the shower head needs to be replaced. The check out directions had us strip our bed sheets and put them in the washer with our towels and start a load on the way out. I'm not sure if this is normal for most AirBnBs' but I've never had to do that before. Overall it was a quiet clean place to stay.

We requested a late check-out when booking and she happily obliged, which we were so grateful for as we needed to get ready for a wedding in town! She was very responsive and helpful.
The house is beautiful, so much vintage charm, and came fully stocked with everything basic that you would need during a short-term stay. All of the guests in our party, unprompted, said that if we're ever in the area again we'd gladly stay here!"

Stayed a few nights","Context: Son's Wedding in Gainesville. Parking - 10/10. Had up to 4 vehicles at times. Safe - 10/10. House and location so nice that my wife relocated her mother and sister from hotel to the double twin bed room. Lots of room to spread out with the 2 living spaces and outside space; had 6 in the house very comfortably. Primary bedroom suite area including bathroom is totally secluded from other bedrooms, not issue for privacy while preparing for wedding or going to sleep early, very pleasant surprise. All appliance, HVAC, hot water, wifi, TV's all great. Good running from this location for 45 minutes jogs. Downtown very close and the first downtown building is a very nice parking deck to park(if cooler, would have walked). There is a downtown city trolley stop 50 yds. from house. Did not use as was on a very ridged schedule. I do know other that enjoyed this service. As far as value, given the location, amenities, ease of use and the upkeep of property, its 10/10."

Stayed a few nights","Breanna's home is comfortable and exactly as described. We appreciated the size of the bedrooms, quality of the beds/bedding, and home layout that provided two living rooms and easy bathroom access (there are two full baths) to all guests. Pet friendly turned out to be a plus as we ended up bringing the family dog when our usual dog sitter had to cancel. The provided washer and dryer were also helpful. The kitchen was workable - we ate in twice as few restaurants in the nearby Town Square area can accommodate a dairy and gluten allergy (but we're used to that - one of the reasons we usually stay in an airbnb. There is a furnished back patio we were able to enjoy one afternoon and a firepit area that we did not utilize (weather wasn't great). I would highly recommend Breanna's home to anyone looking for a place to stay in Gainesville."

The only not so great thing for us was I had contacted her for an early check-in which she said she was fine with. After hearing this I immediately booked. When we got check in instructions the early check in was no longer available. We did not end up needing it so things worked out however, this would have really thrown a wrench in our plans had we needed it like we thought. We enjoyed our stay!"

Stayed one night","Breanna is lighting fast with the communication and her kindness epitomizes the Southern Hospitality that one hopes for when visiting Georgia.
The house is adorable, functional, clean, and has so many little perks that makes the value for this home such a treasure!
I loved that I could close off the sleeping quarters from the living areas so that my littlest could still maintain an early bedtime while everyone else could stay awake play darts, enjoy snacks, and watch TV (there are 3 tv's!).
When I was tired, I was also able to close my portion of the house off from the community areas and the fun continued for everyone else while I slept peacefully on the most comfortably firm mattress I've ever experienced away from home.
When I woke up early to enjoy my yoga practice, I was able to carry on without disturbing the (now sleeping) night owls.
The neighborhood is peaceful and clean.
The driveway is a dream, you can pull all the way into property and turn your car around so that you don't have to back out into traffic when you leave.
Gently try out the doorbell. It sounds like the bells of heaven.
The refrigerator has a filtered water dispenser! Even though I packed my own water (I'm funny about water), it was awesome that Breanna offers this little perk!
The tile floor in the back bathroom is just lovely! The shower has an adjustable, removable head so you can be sure to get as clean as you would hope!
If I ever just want to get away for an evening or 3, I will seek out Miss Breanna's Brilliant Bungalow!
I hope you enjoy your stay as much as I did."

Stayed a few nights","Lovely, cozy, very comfy home away from home! This house is in a very quiet and charming neighborhood just a few blocks from the historic town square, and only 2 blocks from the gorgeous Victorian mansions on Green Street and the cultural arts center. A few blocks in the other direction on Ridgewood are gorgeous trails, parks and the free access dock and pavilion on Lake Lanier. Dahlonega is only 20 miles away.
The mid-century decor was so tastefully done. The beds and bedding are very comfortable. This house is situated at a high point in town, with great sunrises and sunsets to be seen from that high vantage point. Lots of big windows; I enjoyed keeping the blinds open for lots of natural light. I appreciated the live plants in the house. The full kitchen with the big, sunny window was one of my favorite rooms. It’s been lovingly restored to mid-century fabulousness, in detail. As one who needs a full kitchen and cooks from scratch even while traveling, this was perfect. The backyard was really cute, and we loved the fire pit with solar lighting around it. Beautiful!"

It is obvious they care about their home and their guests, and have provided quality finishes and amenities. We spent most of our time outside and were so pleased that even the deck/dock furnishings were of nice quality, where we felt comfortable sitting for hours! No flimsy plastic chairs here! The kitchen is fully stocked with everything you need to cook great meals, and our group raved about their beds - so comfortable! We would love to visit their lake home again when it’s warmer and enjoy some boating and swimming! It was truly a great experience and we were thankful to enjoy their slice of heaven!"

Stayed with kids","The house was beautiful, great location on the lake, well stocked, and pristine. Lisa and Lenny were very responsive and wonderful hosts. The only thing that was a tiny bit unclear for me was that the owners may be there at the time of the stay, in a basement apartment, with a separate entrance, but we hardly saw them at all. Also, if you do not rent a boat from them, their boat will likely be rented out, and there will be boat renters on the dock at times coming and going. But they do not stay on the dock, and the dock is free for you to use and hang out on. Just letting others know our experience, as we were a little bit apprehensive about it, but it ended up being just fine. We had a lovely stay, and would definitely stay there again!"

We rented the boat also through Boatsetter which was very convenient. We will definitely be back! Our kids favorite family vacation yet!"

Had everything we needed in the kitchen to prep for a large gathering we had at a different house up the street. House was very private at the end of the street.

Stayed with kids","This home was exactly as described and even better! The house was in a perfect location--at the end of a road, right on the lake. It felt very private. The house was immaculate and very tastefully decorated--you felt like you were in a home; not just a rental house. There was plenty of seating area and I loved that it had 2 separate living rooms to spread out. Everything in the home was updated--kitchen was very large and had literally everything you would need to cook. Sometimes when you rent, the appliances, bowls, cooking utensils are limited, but this house had everything, including coffee maker, blender, etc. The bathrooms were spacious and the water pressure in the showers was excellent.
The outside was exceptional. There are multiple porches--some screened in, some open. It offered several different places to enjoy the view of the lake and have space to spread out. There was a fire pit that was completely finished on a paver patio with enough seating for everyone--we made s'mores at night--it was the perfect place to hang out and the kids loved it.
The house offers a pontoon boat rental which was perfect for days on the lake with the family. The dock also had an upstairs patio feature where you could eat, sunbathe or just relax, with a birds eye view of the lake. If you brought your own boat, there was a small park/boat dock down the road, within the neighborhood. We took a walk on one of the trails there and saw lots of deer.
The house feels like you're away from the busy city, but also has grocery shopping and restaurants close by.
The owner was an excellent communicator. Accessing the home was very easy. If we had any questions at all, they responded right away.
We would definitely love to visit this home again in the future!"

There were welcome snacks when we arrived. The bathrooms and kitchens had all the supplies needed. The house is super clean and very new and updated. The pictures do not do this property justice. It’s comfy and cozy in every way. The owners where the on the terrace level. We only saw them a few times when they were coming and going. They were very helpful and answer all of our questions. The beds were really comfy. Lake Lanier is beautiful. We look forward to visiting again and taking advantage of the boat and kayaks they have for rent. I would give this property and the owners 10 stars if I could. See you next time Lake Lanier!

Communication was excellent! The owners were in the basement level during our stay but we only saw them coming and going from their entrance downstairs a couple times. They were very friendly and answered our questions about the area.
The house manual was filled with very useful information about the house and helpful information about area activities.
We have already started looking for airfare to come back this fall. When we return we will stay longer and rent the boat and kayaks. This is by far the best Airbnb we have stayed at. Highly recommend!"

Saturday. The pool was a huge hit with our grandchildren. Definitely looking forward to coming back."

Stayed with kids","We enjoyed Natanya’s home. The upstairs kitchen was very well stocked. Definitely check in before going to the grocery store as there are lots of spices and condiments available. The solo cup holder with the marker was brilliant along with the available paper plates and plastic cutlery holder.
Our grand children loved the game room downstairs. The double garage was available too and the grandchildren enjoyed skating in there.
Be sure to bring flip flops and a swimsuit for the hot tub. There are plenty of hot tub towels available.
The living room is large and was wonderful for our family gatherings. We played several games and there was plenty of room. Thank you for leaving the Christmas tree up even though our stay was after Christmas.
The downstairs kitchen is nice but not stocked. Our oldest grandson chose it as his bedroom and we were grateful for the queen size air mattress for his use. Overall we had a lovely experience."

Group trip","We booked this house to host a combined bachelor's/bachelorette's trip for our friends. The host was not only incredibly communicative, but accommodating for us, with impressive rental host skills on display all around the house. We did not use the lake amenities due to the season but they were accessible! We did, however, really enjoy the use of the Hot Tub and fire pit.
Everyone on the trip agreed that this was the cleanest, most well-stocked rental we had ever had the pleasure of experiencing. We're already discussing a possible return trip next year. We're incredibly grateful to our host, and would happily return. This is not your average AirBNB. Book it!"

Natanya provides so many extras, toothbrushes, toothpaste, q tips, floss, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, coffee, tea, creamer, sugar, and more! This home itself was perfect for our women’s retreat and the ladies are already asking to go back! Natanya’s communication was EXCELLENT, I had ALOT of questions hosting women there and she was quick to respond to all of them!
The views of the lake are beautiful, the home is even more spacious then it looks in the picture, the multiple decks with lounge chairs, hammocks, and dock sun bathing deck was thoroughly enjoyed! And all the lake gear and equipment +++
This place with 2 full kitchens would be awesome for multiple families vacationing together! Don’t overthink it, book this stay! You won’t regret it!"

This is the perfect place for multiple families - it’s huge, with lots of space to spread out and find privacy. From the view, to the downstairs rec area, to the amazing kitchen with an INCREDIBLE view, this house is worth every penny. We flew all the way to Georgia for our girls’ trip, but barely left the house because it was so great.

Get here first before you order groceries as the house has a ton of items already - from plastic baggies to spices to condiments. We found the house to be pretty centralized, as we used it for our home base to travel to Helen (1 hr), Dahlonega (30 mins), and Atlanta (1 hr). We went during winter but would return for summer as the house has a lot to offer for the lake. The host was exceptional: responsive, courteous, and organized. They even had a Christmas tree up when we arrived. We had a great time. Would do it again."

One of us had to do some remote work from the house, so we were very happy with the accommodations made to allow us to still be able to work; not to mention from an office desk with a beautiful view. Also, having all the cabinets and light switches labeled was a FANTASTIC idea!

The location is Priceless. Every room, except 1, has a great view of the lake. The view of the beautiful trees and lake was so peaceful. Although we cooked all our meals, this house is conveniently located near plenty restaurants and grocery stores. Natanya is a great host. She was very responsive when we had questions.

We were having a Celebration of Life at a nearby park for my husband who passed away in January after a tough battle with Colon Cancer. Upon arriving at the home, a beautiful flower arrangement was awaiting us from the host offering her condolences. She thought of everything: lights and chargers next to the beds, extra chargers, face wash in the bathroom, labeling kitchen cabinets and so much more. The views were amazing with the big windows. There’s a game room downstairs. There’s a dock that has 2 levels. Sitting on the top level of the dock was so peaceful.

The kitchen even had paper goods and ziplocks/foils. We loved all the coffee and hot chocolate collection the host had provided. The linens and towels provided were of high quality, including extra sets of pillows/comforters if needed. The host paid attention to every tiny details and provided everything to make it a comfortable stay (just like your own home).
Furthermore, Ms Natanya (host) was very considerate and helped us out while we were stuck in the snow and had to extend our stay. Communication is clear and prompt.

It is such a lovely home and has an updated feel while still maintaining the integrity of the building style, being an older home with a real vintage vibe, yet feeling well insulated and not drafty at all like some older homes can sometimes be. The house is located in a neighborhood that is full of historic homes. The area felt safe which is especially important for a traveling family like ours. The kitchen was generously stocked to meet guests needs for preparing meals. It is a cozy place and we felt right at home! The yard is large and there is a fenced in backyard with an outdoor seating area. Thank you for a great travel experience! We hope to return again sometime soon!"

Group trip","The place was great! My sister is getting married in a few weeks so she wanted to have a low-key getaway with us sisters and a few close friends. We booked in Gainesville so we’d be close to Chateau Elan, where we spent the majority of our time. The amenities made it easy for us to execute all the planned activities, & really relax and enjoy ourselves. The rooms were cozy & the beds were all extremely comfy!
I gave 4 stars for location only because we had planned on walking around Downtown but were too tired to go on the day we planned so I can’t say exactly how walkable everything was. The driveway was surprisingly steep despite photos so just know that if you have a low-hanging car, do street parking or make it where you can back out from the top because the dip in the driveway is easy to scrape going forward.
Kate was very responsive, friendly, & quick to help with anything we were missing or needed. You can feel the love in this family-made home ♥️
Thank you, Kate!"

Group trip","The house served its purpose, it’s cute and quaint but very dated. The owners limit towels and toilet paper, no garbage bags. Which led to having to wash the towels so everyone could take one shower, but toilet paper and garbage bags. Owner did send $10 for the bags and toilet paper but those things should be stocked. Again not a bad place just not the style/ammenities Airbnb we are used to."

Stayed with a pet","This ‘historic’ home has so much charm. Plenty of space for a larger group to spread out to visit: Two ‘living/family’ areas, two tables for dining/games, and two bathrooms. The back yard made caring for dogs’ needs convenient and effortless. Beds very comfortable, water hot, plenty of linens. **Be aware that this is an older neighborhood, with narrow sidewalks with lots of obstacles, which may not be suitable for folks with mobility issues.** Lovely time—would definitely visit again!"

The decor is beautifully thought out and arranged, allowing for a natural flow of space and and enjoyment of the surroundings.
The kitchen was a delight for cooking meals, with everything provided and in good working order.
The bed was one of those you just don’t want to get out of, and I took full advantage of sleeping in!
Chatting and communication with Esther and Mike was easy and enjoyable.
My entire stay was lovely, and the experience a relaxing and rejuvenating one.

Esther was highly responsive and friendly regarding a very minor issue I encountered. I also loved getting snuggles from a sweet kitten who greeted me in the driveway each day (no pets were in/near the unit itself though, for those sensitive to cats).

Loved that you had plenty of privacy and didn't feel like you were staying with the host at all. Super clean, beautifully decorated and thoughtful space. We could hear some faint running around upstairs from what I assumed was a little one in the morning but it wasn't anything that disrupted our stay. Would stay again and recommend!"

Esther and Michael responded when I had questions….I could not have been more comfortable to make a normally stressful situation to be away from home an enjoyable one. I looked forward to returning each evening. If we have a reason in the future to return to Gainsville, We would definitely stay at this apartment. Thank you so much Esther and Michael!"

Stayed a few nights","My wife & I absolutely loved the house! Our only regret was the rest of our family wasn't there to enjoy the spacious living and dining area together! Or to enjoy the beautiful views of the lake through the amazing floor to roof windows & glass doors! We enjoyed peaceful mornings with our coffee on the comfortable porch furniture & gas firepit. The kitchen was ready to prepare a feast! There's a grocery store 3 minutes from the house at the entrance of the neighborhood for any supplies. The cul-de-sac the house sits on was very quiet. My wife & I are already planning a future trip back w/ family. More bedrooms would help us with that. It seems that may happen in the future on a lower level. The hosts were very responsive & friendly! This was a great find! Only 30 min from Dahlonega, GA & Helen, GA if you're wanting to enjoy those Hallmarkesk towns like we did. Gainesville square was an unexpected treat to visit for shops & great food as well."

The kitchen is wonderful. We loved cooking meals in it.
The bathrooms and bedrooms were very clean and decorated beautifully.
It is in a great neighborhood. You are close to everything yet there is so much privacy because of the way the house is situated on the property. We did not spend much time by the lake as we were only in town a few days but it would be a great place to sit on the dock in the sun and enjoy the paddleboard and kayaks.
The best part was the screened in porch. It was so peaceful to sit and watch the leaves fall in front of the gas fireplace.
My daughter will be moving to Gainesville in the next couple of weeks and we would always want to rent this place to come visit in the future. It is truly wonderful"

The house is open concept, large enough for the family to gather. If you prefer, there is also a gas grill on the porch, or you can throw some burgers on the fire pit.

The screened in porch is great for lounging with coffee and a book in the morning and was a good option to keep mosquitoes away. The dock was also nice for spending a day in and out of the water, while the kayaks and paddle board allowed us to venture a little further out.
Very good communication from Jessica—she was very accommodating.
This rental is a good step up from some of the more “rustic” options in the area, much cleaner feeling and more modern."

It was fantastic. Clean, spacious, amazing location and setting, convenient, and all the little details that make it feel like you're really fortunate to be there. Also, Jessica is a fantastic host. I'm pretty chatty lol, but she never made me feel like I was a bother. Also, I had some scheduling particularities, but she accommodated me so graciously and REALLY went out of her way to make me feel at home. I actually live nearby, but needed a little ""getaway"" from the bustle of my home to focus on a work project during the days and to rest and relax in the evenings. In was a perfect place to work in, and somehow ALSO a perfect place to rest and recharge. In all honesty, I'm already looking forward next time! Since it's a fairly new listing, my only worry is that I won't be able to afford it next time, haha!"

Lizzy and her team have a beautiful little place. It’s cozy and clean and all the things they promise. But then there’s Lizzy and her team. Her cleaning crew left us treats and flowers. She was totally responsive, exceptionally warm. My husband and I traveled to GA with great expectations that unfortunately led to a significant disappointment. To Lizzy, we weren’t just guests and room rates; we were people first. She was deeply kind and understanding. If you’re choosing between this place and somewhere else, choose this place.

Check-in was simple and seamless, my husband was able to work remotely without issue, the house had everything we needed, it was very clean, and check-out was super quick and easy. So many great activities and restaurants were nearby as well, like the town square was super close so we made multiple trips there to get ice cream cones from Kilwin’s and walk around the square doing some window shopping. Also, until our stay here my husband and I have never stayed anywhere (except our own house) that the bed didn’t end up being uncomfortable for one or both of us, but for literally the first time ever, neither of us had a single issue! I don’t know what brand mattress it is, but I want one now because it was soooooooo comfy!!!! We’ve never slept better while away from home!"

Stayed a few nights","Our family was visiting Gainesville over Father’s Day week to be with my husband who is a travel surgical technologist. Originally, I booked a hotel but upon arrival we realized it was not ideal for our family. I canceled the hotel after the first night and found Lizzy’s cottage listing on a booking app. The location of the cottage was in a quiet older home neighborhood. We loved the coziness of the place and appreciated the snacks and drinks when we arrived. Everyone felt right at home the first day. We all slept comfortably in the beds. The shower had shampoo, conditioner and body soap in a wall dispenser if you forget to bring your own. Lizzy was responsive to all my inquiries and very clear with the expectations of the cottage. Inside the cottage the light switches were labeled, wi-fi information and other pertinent information was displayed. In the future, when we plan to visit my husband, I will definitely try to book this place again."

As an older home, Lizzy has two dehumidifiers to help with the older home smell and to keep it comfortable. Kitchen was so clean! We did not cook, but it was well stocked. We had hotel reservations and cancelled them for Lizzy's place. So glad we did!"

Stayed a few nights","The cottage was everything that we needed and more! I flew in from Alaska on a family emergency and Lizzy made sure that everything was ready to go when I got there. The last thing I wanted to stress over was a place to stay, but she made everything easy. The house is beautifully furnished and arranged stock full of everything you and your family (even kids!) need for your stay. we loved the house and will be returning again. Additionally the cottage is a short drive to downtown Gainesville with plenty of great restaurants! The location is very quiet with the occasional deer in the gulley across the way to watch roam around.
My family extends their utmost gratitude and thanks for allowing us to stay while we were in troubling times. I cannot recommend Lizzy and the cottage enough. I will be recommending this AirBNB to family and friends in the future and returning if need be."

Stayed over a week","When our 19 year old daughter was rushed to Northeast Georgia Medical Center, we had no idea that we would be living in Gainesville for the next 27 days. After renting a hotel for a few nights, it became evident that we were going to be in CCU for quite some time, so we started looking for a house. Thankfully, Lizzy's listing was the first one we saw, and it was less than a half mile from the hospital. From the moment we walked through the door, the house felt like home. Lizzy has not left out one single amenity. The house on Mulberry Lane was our sanctuary after hours of waiting room sitting. We prepared meals in the kitchen and enjoyed them at the big table together. Lizzy is a great communicator and offered her prayers and help after hearing what we were going through. I cannot praise this experience enough. We will be bringing our daughter back to stay and to see where we lived while she fought for her life. Thank you, Lizzy, for sharing your home with us!"

Stayed with kids","An unforgettable stay at this amazing cottage.
Myself, along with my wife and 2 year old son, stayed here for over a month.
We welcomed our 2nd son into this world early on in our stay and this place couldn’t have been better for us.
The house has had new renovations done with modern upgrades, has a huge living area for everyone to stretch their legs, and an incredibly clean and well organized kitchen. The bathroom is also very clean and well maintained.
The cottage is located on an extremely quiet road surrounded by huge old growth trees that make it a very relaxing place to be.
The road is also very safe with very friendly neighbors around.
And although the cottage is located on a quiet street, you’re literally seconds from grocery stores, fast food, the hospital, etc.
This cottage is truly a rare find with its quiet location in the middle of the beautiful city of Gainesville.
This was the first time we were ever genuinely sad to leave an Airbnb.
We made memories at this house, and we are excited for the next round of folks that get to stay here."

The place was exactly as described, I thought it was a great price for the area compared to local hotels, and the owners were extremely organized and ""with it"" without having to do any complicated or extensive communication. Felt very at home, beautiful surroundings- we even saw a mama deer literally lying down in our yard upon first arrival! What a beautiful welcome :) over the 5 days we were there we got to see the babies this mama deer had and they were absolutely adorable! This was just a little unexpected boost to make the stay even better. Place was perfect and private and the owners were very responsive and prompt the one time we reached out with a question. Highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","Please be warned, host did not have blinds up in the living room, which consisted of 2 windows facing his neighbors with open view to see everything. Once we left out, he then entered the air bnb to see our makeshift curtains that we put up to ensure we had privacy. He then complained about this once we returned. He then offered to put up curtains once we left out again. Once we left, he contacted me saying we pretty much had to return and pack up because the place “smelled like weed” and that it was illegal! We never once smoked inside or on the property! I informed the host that the only thing we smoked was delta 8 cannabis inside my car, but i was still requested to leave. If you have to use any type of medical cannabis or just a smoker in general, please be careful when using this property."

Stayed a few nights","Saddened, because this is the first time I’ve ever written a less than glowing review on an AirBnB. It was an “Ok” stay. The host was great and the basement was fairly clean. There’s a definite lack to detail compared to other homes I’ve stayed in with AirBnB. The furniture throughout the basement was stiff and cheap, the walls were discolored and bedding was not very comfortable at all. Great safe location, but far from relaxing. They have a dog who barks throughout the day, and there was loud audible cooking and talking late into the night.
I might have had expectations too high, but hey, ya win some and lose some. To be fair though, I never complained or brought these things to the hosts attention as I felt most of them wouldn’t be “fixable” in the moment. That may be shortsighted of me.
Good value if you’re looking for a cheap place to lay your head."

Sinks down in the middle. Spent 5 nights. Saturday- Wednesday. I messaged host Monday night about bed. Never received reply. Other Airbnb host that I have messaged have always replied within several hrs. I looked under bed and seen 2 support boards were broken.

Stayed a few nights","Directions were clear and clarifying. As soon as I walked in, I was awed by the personal touches to make the space welcoming. A low lamp was on, so I wasn't in the dark. The kitchen table was already set with clean dishes adorned with breakfast treats. In the bedroom, there was a bed-tray with sweets and a mug with adjacent fresh towels. Most importantly, the linens were clean. Everything you could need or want was provided. Even basic toiletries were provided! Everything was perfect and I was sad to leave my weekend sanctuary. My only suggestion - and I realize this issue is likely due to my ineptitude - but I wish I had known how to lock the door properly on my way out. No problems getting in, and Felicia responded immediately when I notified her that I had locked myself out. All that is needed is instructions stating to use the same code when leaving. I felt like an idiot after I figured it out too late. Otherwise, an A+++ One of the best Air B-n-B's I have stayed in."

Stayed a few nights","Place was as described. I booked this place because it is only 40 minutes from Helen, GA. Here are my thoughts...
Pros:
-quite & clean location at the end of a cul de sac
-central air
-mini kitchenette
-easy check-in
- Walmart located about 10 minutes away
-free parking
-host is easy to contact & friendly
-safe neighborhood
-comfortable mattress
-private entrance
Things to note:
-the driveway is a steep hill, it's easier to pull out of the driveway rather than reverse out
-you MUST go down a flight of stairs to reach the entrance (this did not bother me, but might bother future guests)
-the entrance is surrounded by trees, there is a possibility of mosquitos in the area so keep that in mind
-the nearby roads in the area can be hilly
-there is no formal sink dedicated to dirty dishes (just the bathroom sink, but there is a bin in the cabinet to place your dirty dishes in)
Overall, I enjoyed my stay & would definitely recommend !"

Private entrance takes a little walking to get to but it is highlighted by a BEAUTIFUL deck and lined with the woods. Private and peaceful. Beware of SPIDERS however. None were inside the unit but they where all around the outside. Plenty of space for 2. Love the big couch. No kitchen sink. Only sink is in the bathroom. All-in-all I would absolutely book again as long I don’t have to drive to ATL for anything. Gainesville is very far from ATL.

Stayed a few nights","The home is situated in a beautiful, peaceful and safe neighborhood surrounded by nature. The rental is well equipped and very-very spacious. Clean bathroom, clean kitchen. The mini fridge is located in the living room right by the kitchen. (I do not recall seeing it in any of the photos but future guests can rest assured there is a fridge and it works great). The lack of a sink in the kitchen did not hinder us much since we did not intend to cook. The driveway is a bit steep for low profile vehicles but if you are careful, it is manageable. As an alternative, free street parking is available. If you plan to park in the private driveway in front of the house, you may want to consider parking under the basketball hoop with your vehicle's trunk facing the house. You will have a much easier time navigating the driveway when you leave."

Stayed a few nights","We arrived to find two very loud de-humidifiers in the bedroom and living room. I texted host to request permission to turn them off only while we were there in the evenings. I was having a hard time breathing due to the musty smell. After texting host twice upon arrival with a question, she said she was hopping on a flight and was turning her phone off. I did not receive any follow-up texts for the three days we were there.
There is no sink in the kitchenette area so our use of it was limited. Basin in a cabinent marked ""dirty dishes"" had previous guest's dirty dishes .
Pillows were comfortable, but bed slumps causing us to roll into the center.
Was a challenge to get out of the driveway from our designated parking space; we could only back up the length of the steep driveway when the house resident's car was there. Tough with bikes on back.
Several times we each hurt our foot on bathroom threshold which has a sharp metal protrusion.
Healthy snacks and candy were a treat."

Stayed a few nights","The extra special touches were greatly appreciated inside of the property from the bowl of mixed chocolates to the beautifully staged tray on the bed. Plenty of blankets to wrap around my shoulders while sitting on the deck in the evening. The front landscaping is beautiful. It was a treat seeing flowers in bloom. We were a bit disappointed in the comfort of the bed, it dips in the middle which meant myself or my husband had to sleep on the couch to get some rest. The upstairs deck needed some TLC to set the tone for the homey feeling of our accommodations. I thought I’d make you aware the water is draining very slowly in the bathtub also the floor in the bathroom was Very slippery for some reason. We really enjoyed how peaceful and quiet the property was. Thank you for sharing your home with us.

Stayed a few nights","Absolutely loved my stay here, very cozy and homey. Instructions were perfect, very clear, and as I got in rather late they left lights on for me with fantastic homey touches, even folded toilet paper art! Very communicative, and for those concerned, there are stairs, that were easily navigable even in the dark and rain as there was plenty of lighting and rugs. For those like myself who need quiet and dark to sleep, the bedroom is superb! Close to plenty of places to eat. Would definitely stay here again."

Its thought in the middle of everything - so close to restaurants and Publix! 🙂"

Located at the end of the block 5 - 10 minutes away from many shopping and dining options, the description is accurate and instructions were clear, although some reviews mention trouble with the entrance door being hard to open/close I found no trouble there, also the steep staircase wasn't an issue unless you are constantly coming in and out. The bedroom, bathroom, kitchenette and living room space were kept in good clean and organized condition, overall I will definitely book a stay here again !"

Definitely recommend checking this location out! I was worried about the privacy with the apartment attached to the home, however the privacy was perfect. The apartment had its own deck and private entrance. Topped off with a gorgeous view. Can’t beat this price."

Stayed a few nights","I arrived at the house very late at night and found the white stone arrows on the left side which led me to the back of the home. What I didn’t anticipate was that I then had to navigate a short, but steep downward path of rocks, railroad ties, and large tree roots. I am recovering from a knee injury and honestly wasn’t sure if I was going to be able to make it to the deck to enter the apartment – went very, very slowly. Once inside, the apartment is exactly as advertised! Very cute, cozy, quiet, and clean with lots of nice little touches that make a stay extra nice. Many more bells and whistles than you would expect for the price. The neighborhood seemed very nice and I felt safe as a female traveling alone. Very pleased and highly recommend. I would just note that if you have mobility issues, navigating the short trail to the basement could pose a problem; I would suggest contacting the host before booking to see if she can provide photos so you can assess the terrain, or offer advice to more easily reach the entry door."

The location, backed up by woods and underneath a second deck, was a little intimidating for me but once we got inside all was well. Great place got the price too!"

Stayed a few nights","We are artists and were in the general area for a show. We drive an oversize vehicle and Felicia was very quick to repond to my questions regarding parking. The driveway is steep and short but we managed parking just fine.
The home is in a quiet, well kept neighborhood on a culdesac. We did miss the small sign with the address at the end of the driveway initially so a more prominant house number might help (or it could just be that we were tired from 4 hours of driving 🙂).
The path around the house to the back was well marked (and lighted at night) but people with mobility issues should pay close attention to the listing. There are a couple of steps UP to the first deck then 12 steps or so DOWN to the deck off of the rental property. You can SEE the steps in the listing photos but I assumed the room was on the ground level from the driveway. That said, the steps were fine for us (we only had two small bags) and there are two handrails. The little deck area was cute (although we didnt use it) but it would have need a little tidying up before we could....expect that....it IS in the woods. 😉
Entry into the room was easy with the coded door lock. (Note: the door sticks at the bottom and we had to give it a little push with a foot to get it to open. When locking it from the outside, you have to pull on the door as you push the lock button. You also need to push it a little while locking from the inside or it doesn't catch.)
Once inside, the space was beautiful! 💚 Everything was so nice and there were thoughtful touches everywhere. SO happy to find a cord available (with USB ports)...we have a lot of things to charge when we travel for shows and we rarely find enough places to charge all of our devices. The spigot handle in the tub is a little wonky but it only took a minute to figure it out....plenty of hot water in the shower with good pressure. Final note about the space....for US the bed was not very comfortable....maybe too soft? It felt like the middle sunk in and gave the feeling we were rolling into a hole. On the upside of that, the pillows were AWESOME and the couch was really comfortable so we still got plenty of rest.
All in all, I would definitely love to stay here again if we get back to this area. 👍"

I felt at home and I loved that feeling! I didn’t even have to bother Felicia about anything because she basically had all the details ready and set up. The bed was very comfortable and if by any chance you may leave something at home even if it’s a personal item she had it there. I will be back to Georgia and when I do come back this is where I will be staying!!!"

Would have been more comfortable with lightning in the deck area arrived in the evening.
Host was quick to respond."

Stayed a few nights","This place is awesome! Super comfy and homey! Felicia was very responsive! Very private! Other than the fact that I met one of the residents in the driveway, I couldn’t even tell anyone else was there! Definitely would recommend!"

Check in was super easy and description of the house was spot on.
Next time we visit Gainesville, we will definitely book our stay with Felicia!"

Stayed a few nights","Quiet, comfortable and cozy.
Everything was clean and welcoming. The path to get to the room was cute. Comfortable bed, comfortable space.
Just a nice little place of calm relaxation for me in the midst of a busy weekend was just what I needed."
