Stayed with a pet","Pam was nice and communicated well. Enid is small so location is pretty central, but to be honest we did not enjoy our stay. We were skeptical upon pulling into neighborhood. Very run down area. The outer appearance was quite concerning. There were three cars parked in drive next to home. Inside was clean, but very old. Furnace does not heat bedrooms unless doors are left open. The furniture felt like sitting on plywood. The beds were comfortable, but they were so squeaky I thought I was going to wake my baby every time I moved. The shower is tiny! You couldn’t turn around without opening the curtain. I’m not trying to be rude. Like I said, Pam was a good host, but the home does not meet rental standards, in my opinion. We would not recommend or return."

Pam checked in with me before arrival, during our stay, and after we checked out. Super helpful and accommodating! Excellent host!"

Only a few minutes from my mom's house so the back and forth wasn't bad at all. Pam responded quickly, no matter the time of day. She communicated very well. The decor was great, the atmosphere. My pet ended up not coming but he would have loved the back yard. This place owes us nothing except to be available next time we visit! Thanks again Pam!"

Stayed a few nights","Pam’s house was the perfect place for me to stay while I was in town visiting family. It is an older house in an older neighborhood, but Pam has fixed up the interior of her house and it was very welcoming. The window a/c units kept the house plenty cool in the Oklahoma summer heat. Every amenity needed was in the kitchen, plenty of towels in the bathroom, and lots of fluffy pillows on the beds. Next time I travel to Enid, I’ll be sure to check to see if this home is available for me to stay in."

I was initially concerned when I saw there were windows air conditioning units (it was 103 degrees outside when I arrived!) but there was a unit in almost every room and the house was very comfortable. Loved the claw foot bath tub! Bed was very comfortable. Kitchen has a few older home “quirks” like oddly placed switches and plug ins, but easily figured out. Pam super friendly and responsive to all my questions."

Stayed with kids",Pam’s place was perfect! Pam was very responsive and friendly the entire time we stayed. Pam allowed us to check in a little early which worked perfect since we brought our baby along. We made the mistake of not following the instructions when leaving the house and Pam had her aunt come help within 30 minutes. Her aunt was just as friendly and made sure we got back in the house even though it was late. We enjoyed the cozy living area and kitchen! Everything was clean and exactly as advertised. We will definitely be staying at Pam’s place the next time we are in Enid. Thank you Pam for your amazing hospitality!

During downtime, Pam's place was the perfect place to relax, fix a meal and chill. Pam's place is also convenient to the rest of Enid. We enjoyed visiting the park and seeing the wonderful Christmas decorations. If you are in Enid for activities at Vance AFB or just passing through, I highly recommend staying at Pam's bungalow."

There’s no central air nor any fans in the bedrooms, so just be prepared that it will be a bit hot when you get there. Could use a little renovation, but overall I liked the house!"

Stayed over a week","Chelsie is an amazing host! She always responded so quickly and was so helpful. I’m in town for a travel job at the hospital. New to the area. New to Oklahoma.
The house is just what I was looking for, it was perfect. A short, five minute drive to the hospital. Even shorter to the downtown area. Minutes from Callaghan’s, Axe throwing, breweries, Cafe Volare for brunch and Napoli’s for Italian. Less than ten minutes from Walmart and groceries. House is COMPLETELY stocked with dishes, appliances, pots/pans, coffee pot, even a blender for smoothies. Even supplied basic cooking spices, condiments, detergents, ziplocks, trash bags, q-tips… every detail was taken care of. Was easily able to cook full meals. Stepped right into the house and had everything needed to live for weeks.
Gorgeous, magical back yard area. Loved the hanging chair. If visiting from out of town, make sure you visit the event Center a couple miles away, Gloss Mountain and crystal digging at the Salt Plains."

She had lots of little personal touches that we so enjoyed. The girls loved the masks, beauty products, essential oils, glasses chilling in the freezer, and even cute cupcake tins they used. The back porch hanging swing was used a lot. The girls asked if we could rent it again! It is our new favorite place to stay in Enid! We will be back!!!!! Thank you so much for all your thoughtful touch. It really made our stay memorable"

Check in/ out , house rules were communicated clearly. Randy even had a small binder available with need to know info about the home and info on things to do/ places to eat in the area.
The kitchen was stocked with quality kitchen tools and accessories that made cooking easier. The fenced in backyard was for our boys to toss the football to each other."

It felt just like home with extra blankets and throws, extremely well appointed kitchen (even and air-fryer and tea kettle), and everything we needed. My husband worked from the kitchen table and had no issues with connectivity. Instructions for everything from the keys to lights were AMAZING every step of the way, very clear and accurate. Randy responded quickly and thoroughly to my inquiries. The location was great for us; a bit desolate but close to the retirement village we were visiting. We will stay here again when we're in town. Bravo."

Stayed over a week","This place was awesome. Our highest recommendation. In all our travels around the world staying in Air BnBs we have never been in a home that was as clean, warm, and inviting as Randy’s. This place had everything. This place was outfitted to a T. There wasn’t anything we needed that Randy hadn’t thought of in advance. Randy has gone the extra mile. He has added all sorts of soothing accent lights in and outside the property. The backyard is private and relaxing. Even a small area to chip a few golf balls. Randy was very proactive in communicating with us. If we had a question we always got a quick response. His “Welcome” book is very extensive and informative with many photos. We enjoyed several of the recommendations around town. We were visiting and helping with grandkids on this visit so to come back each evening to Randy’s place was just what we needed to recharge. Don’t pass this place up if visiting Enid and/or the local area. We’ll be back. Thanks Randy."

I always bring Clorox wipes with me when we travel but I didn't even feel the need to use any it was so clean. Anything you needed or wanted was stocked and available. Randy was very responsive and kind. Super nice to visit with. We enjoyed the lighting in the kitchen above the cabinets and the living room. We will definitely stay there again when we come to Enid.

We had a 2-day drive from PA, & it felt so welcoming & peaceful when we arrived & during our stay. The back yard & patio were so enjoyable to relax in, and the yard was very private. The 2 weeks flew by, and we didn't want to leave. Will most definitely stay here when we come back again! Thank you for everything!"

The accommodations were top-notch. The beds were comfortable, ensuring a restful night’s sleep, & the cleanliness of the entire place was impeccable. The well-equipped kitchen allowed us to prepare our own meals, and we appreciated the thoughtful amenities provided!
From the outstanding hospitality to the charming ambiance and convenient amenities, it exceeded our expectations in every way. Thank you to Randy and his wife, for providing us with an exceptional Airbnb experience. We cannot wait to return!"

The place was spotless when we got in late for check-in and was a quick and easy fit for all of our stuff. the kitchen is really well stocked with utensils, pots, pans, and even crock pots! The extra items provided by Randy were super helpful and really saved me in a pinch. the beds are very comfortable and have multiple pillows, so there is sure to be one you will enjoy. all of the extra lighting really made the place seem like home because you could customize almost every aspect of the place. The TV in the living room was amazing and HUGE. All of the couches reclined which is a big deal in my book! and don't get me started on the backyard! the chipping area is amazing and made for a fun activity to do while you are in between work or other activities. the back porch was very comfortable and well kept like the rest of the property. Every single area of our stay was absolutely fantastic. not a single complaint! (ps.Randy and his wife are perfect!)"

Stayed over a week","We were looking for a place to stay for 4 adults, each needing a seperate bed room. We did not want to stay in a hotel because we had a 5 weeks stay and our business project required to get up at 5 every morning. Since no AirBnB with at least 4 bed rooms was available in the area, Daniel arranged the dining room with some seperators, so we almost had some kind of 4th bed room. We had some minor issues but technicians were arranged instantly. Plenty of coffee was provided, as well as detergent and dish washer tabs. Internet, TV workes as needed and the nearby Wal Mart made it easy to get something to eat if we got home real late. Not only for us a great place to stay but also for families."

The bed linens were very comfy, the towels were fluffy, and there were even beach towels conveniently located near the back door by the pool! We traveled in late May, and nights were still a bit cool. However, we were still able to swim since the pool was heated! So convenient! Daniel was very accommodating and quick to respond anytime we reached out to him. In fact, we were looking for a muffin pan one morning, and his response to our question – he dropped pans off at the door for us within 5 minutes! The spacious home is conveniently located close to a grocery store, pharmacy, and several restaurants! Having a washer and dryer was an added bonus, and the home was stocked with laundry detergent and dryer sheets as well! Was truly a great place to stay for our family to spend quality time with each other!"

They were so kind and provided us with some firewood as well. We had issues with the coffee maker and they generously sent us money to pay for us to get some coffee somewhere on our way out! ☺️☺️☺️"

I had a question and the response was immediate. The house was so cute and sparkling clean. The bed was comfortable. We had all the amenities we could possibly need. The area was a quiet and peaceful. Perfect for sitting out and looking at the stars. We would recommend the Sunset Lodge to anyone visiting the Enid area. So much to do and see in the area. We will be back!

I kept joking that I wanted to move in and never leave, it just felt comfy like home! we got to enjoy meals and enjoy each other’s company in a nice little slice of peace, which is hard to find nowadays! what a wonderful stay, will have to visit again in the future when we need to get away from the hustle and bustle of normal life and admire another gorgeous sunset! >:) thanks again, this place is a MUST-STAY!"

You get the peaceful, rural view sitting in the back overlooking farmland, but are also just 5 minutes away from all the urban conveniences! The space was very clean and the hosts are amazingly accommodating. The neighborhood was a perfect, safe place for my evening jog. I loved the privacy of the unit (fenced and self-check in). I’ll definitely be visiting again, and would recommend to anyone!!"

Each night was like a front row seat to the prettiest sunsets. Loved the swinging bench and fire pit. Hot water and AC work great. Comfy bed. Super spacious. Neighborhood was very peaceful and a very short drive to Walmart and plenty of convenient stores. A lovely little getaway for a great price!"

We loved the space. Felt at home and was beautiful!
Brooke even went above and beyond and even brought our kids tissue paper when she found out our kids were having runny noses.
She is fantastic!
The only thing that stopped us from giving a five star on the location is:
1) There was no grill as advertised.
2) That we got a nail in our tire from their remodeling which they said they would make sure to fix.
3) The back porch and garage back door locks were not great. If someone stayed next to us I would wonder if they could get in. Also we didn’t love the shared backyard with another unit which will be one day another Airbnb. I am sure they will put a privacy fence and hopefully will fix this. They seem like great people.
But this is a great deal and even better host! Don’t let those very small things sway you from booking."

My only complaint, which is minor, is that the hot water ran out somewhat quickly in the shower. I showered for about 10 minutes and then the temperature began to drop quickly. Since we were not spending the bulk of our time in the rental, this was minor.
Overall, we would stay here again!"

He was sure there was not extra cover or a mattress but would see what he could find on a Sunday. When we arrive he had secured a brand new blow up mattress, sheets, blanket and two extra pillows. The private garage (that we were allowed to use), elevator and private entrance were an extra bonus too!! Y’all go ahead and book. You won’t be disappointed. Be safe out there."

We had an issue with the door code and they were there within 5 min to help out. There were several restaurants and bars within walking distance. Definitely recommend!"

Stayed with kids","This home was in a beautiful neighborhood! With little ones, it was very convenient to walk to the large nearby park as well as the walking trails. The house was spotless and oh so cute! When we needed a question answered, Allison responded immediately. Definitely the Airbnb to stay in if you’re coming to Enid, Oklahoma! Another family in our group also rented an Airbnb in Enid and it was nowhere near what we got at Allison‘s place! It had three bedrooms and two baths, but the trade-off for that extra bath was not worth it. It was dreary, run down, not clean, and not decorated or accessorized at all. And yes, the rate per night was slightly cheaper but you pay for what you get!! In the future if we return to Enid, we know exactly where we will be staying! Thank you Allison!"

Stayed a few nights","We cannot imagine a better experience than at Allison’s house. The home is exactly as presented. Everything works properly. The home is in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood convenient to downtown and everything on W. Garriott Dr.
We found the bed and linens to be very comfortable.
There just isn’t anything that we would change.
Carole and I highly recommend this home. And at a nightly cost that was less than a hotel it is a remarkable value."

She had so many extras available- a fan, toothbrushes, snacks, tea, etc. We truly felt at home. It is a wonderful house, and she is a communicative, helpful, and friendly host."

You expect exceptional service but Allison goes beyond and above providing excellent instruction located on cards throughout the home, coffee and tea with small snacks, soap, raisers, ear plugs (not needed) and tooth brushes in case you needed one. Aroma machine was a nice touch. TVs in all rooms and in main room with a well stocked kitchen. The list goes on, absolutely the best AirBnB we’ve stayed at. We’ll definitely be back when we return to Enid. Thank you Allison."

The house was perfect for us - nicely finished, well furnished, sunny, super-clean, and roomy. Great ""starter kit"" in the kitchen, including four ways to fix coffee :-). Allison communicated swiftly and clearly, and conveyed warm friendliness throughout. Lovely Airbnb. We'll stay again next time we're in Enid."

Stayed a few nights","Allison's place was warm and welcoming! We loved the character of the home, with the built-ins and original woodwork, and lovely decor. Having a separate work space was fantastic, and the bedrooms being separated means you won't disturb a travel partner who goes to bed early and gets up early. Easy in & out access to the home, great neighborhood, and convenient central location. Allison made sure we had what we needed and was responsive to all communication. Thanks for a great stay!"

Stayed with kids","My family visited Enid for a family reunion. My husband and I and our 8mo old, as well as my sister and her 3yr old spent 6 nights at Allison's home. The location is great! The neighborhood is super walkable and close to a park and many great restaurants and stores. Everything about our stay exceeded our expectations, so much so we didn't want it to end! Allison's house is beautifully decorated and no stone was left unturned in making our stay beyond comfortable. Having access to a washer and dryer as well as the fully stocked kitchen was essential when traveling with kids. We enjoyed trying all of the Young Living products Allison provided, and I appreciated the low tox feature of the home with the cleaning products used. Everything was spotlessly clean! The provided bathroom amenities were also great and made our stay extra special. All in all, it was abundantly clear Allison takes pride in providing her home to her guests and wants them to feel well taken care of - we sure did!"

The modern furniture was suitable for the younger kids to lay on and relax. The contained back yard was great for the grandkids. We are so pleased. with everything.

Stayed a few nights",Allison is such a welcoming and kind host who made sure to provide more than enough for us during our stay. The beautiful home is in a quiet and equally beautiful neighborhood filled with friendly neighbors. We absolutely enjoyed our stay and would stay again if we visited again. The price for this Airbnb is more than fair and made coming home to it after a work day something to look forward to. The kitchen especially was something my wife and I loved with all its fully stocked cabinets filled with everything from tea and coffee to sharp kitchen utensils and stylish kitchen ware through out. Massive Roku television with one in each bedroom and such comfortable king size beds. The office area was great to get some online paperwork done as well. The outside area we occupied every other day soaking sun listening to the songs of the neighborhood birds and drinking our tea/coffee. Thank you Allison!
