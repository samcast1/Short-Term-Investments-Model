Stayed one night","Me and my dad had a nice visit here as we made our way from Nashville to Fall Creek Falls, which is pretty close to the area.
Pond is larger than I expected and the porch area very nice and really just get to feel off the grid."

Stayed a few nights",Absolutely wonderful stay. The cabin was absolutely spotless and the small touches made the stay so easy. Every light switch was labeled so you weren’t walking around flipping switches trying to figure things out. The kitchen was well stocked and spotless. The bathroom was well stocked. The extra blankets on the couch were a touch as well and the basket of snacks. This will be my go to place when I’m in the area. If you’re looking for a place near Crossville this is the spot!

Stayed one night",Just stayed overnight but enjoyed our visit. Place was very clean and inviting. Bed was so very comfortable. Easy to get around inside since all on one level. Tv kept buffering even though we did what Williaml said and left it on the same channel. Place was well stocked but could use a larger kettle or two if you are planning on cooking. Planning on visiting again. Wish backyard was a little more level or a dock so that we could fish without walking down the road to fish from level ground.

Friendly neighbors, peaceful, and very restful. A good place to relax."

Stayed one night","I wanted a peaceful and quiet retreat from the city, and William’s place fit the bill… still only 20 min from Crossville, but very quiet. Did some fishing in the lake off the back porch. Went for walks in the neighborhood. The house seems very new, and everything was clean and spotless, with little snacks. Lots of things inside are labeled well ( light switches, etc.)
Really enjoyed my stay!"

Stayed with a pet","Gorgeous country home. You can see the mountains in the back yard and the back porch. It really takes you back in history. Homestead homes are all made from the native 'crab orchard"" sandstone.. that area has an interesting history. Everything we needed was there including coffee and creamer, tin foil, paper towels, etc. Very cozy home. We would visit again & highly recommend this home."

Stayed one night","We had a very pleasant stay at Sandpiper House and wouldn't hesitate to return again -- in fact, we plan to! We often travel thru this area with either a box trailer or a flatbed in tow, and have found this place able to accommodate our need for a long wide driveway. (We're estimating the driveway length to be 80-90' long, double car width.) While the drive is downward sloped, it works! -- and not just every place does with a ride that size!
Besides that, the place is clean and well cared for. The home had everything we needed to cook a decent meal and eat at a dining room table, wash and dry a load of laundry, relax in a restful bath, etc. It's the kind of place you feel inclined to remove your shoes at the door -- so of course, we did. The host was friendly and helpful, and quick to reply. All in all, we were well suited during our time there, and we would recommend this home to anyone."

Kids caught quite a few fish just fishing right from the backyard. Plenty of areas inside & out for sitting, heated tile floor in the master bath, the most comfortable beds we've ever slept in, & did I mention how SPOTLESS everything was? This AirBNB was absolutely perfect in every way & we will definitely look for this listing on our next trip to the area!"

The bedrooms were tidy and clean and had several extra blankets in each bedroom. The dining room with the large window was beautiful as it was snowy and the trees were covered in snow birds and cardinals. Wonderful home.

Stayed one night","Saying this Airbnb is a gem is an understatement. We arrived too late in the night to see the surroundings. In the morning we woke up to see the farmlands and the gorgeous nature all around. The unit itself is just beautiful, cozy, fully equipped and extremely quiet.
The bathroom is very clean and fully loaded with clean fluffy towels. My three daughters and I had more than enough towels to take showers in the morning after.
Finding butter flavored microwave popcorn bags after a long night drive was a nice treat. It really made me feel at home.
If there is one thing that I kind of did not enjoy, it would be the hard mattresses and the squeaky beds in tow of the three rooms. I find this to be the case in the majority of Airbnb I booked. Driving for 14 hours and ending up with hard mattress can be really frustrating."

The home is immaculate and beautifully decorated. At night, we saw a mule grazing outside our bedroom window and in the morning, the birds were flocking to the bird feeder and tree out the kitchen window.
We will be looking for another excuse to take a staycation here!"

Very quiet, very safe. This would be a wonderful location for a traveling family or someone looking to stay for a longer period.

Group trip","It was a nice stay for the week. We were a little confused about the instructions on the fridge and I didn’t read the reviews prior to the stay due to wanting “fresh eyes” and not want to have a negative or positive impact of the reservation. It certainly is worth what you pay for. The bed wasn’t as comfortable as it could be, the wifi is spotty and the plumbing for the toilet is outdated. But overall it is tolerable for a getaway vacation with family. Kristi and Curtis was warm and welcoming with her family and of course Ace was a fantastic host. Always with greetings.💕 I can’t wait to do it again! Especially, now that I know what to expect. It is a taste of home being away from home. The mornings was my favorite to have coffee with Ace."

If you’re sensitive to scents just be aware that there are a lot of glade plug ins and heavily scented bedding. We have kids with sensitivities but had our own bedding with us so it was no issue at all. Overall great experience."

We pulled up after dark (full moon!) and the animal sounds were enchanting - complete with coyote howls. Bc we arrived late we were starving and devoured the lovely hospitality-basket goodies (popcorn, Fritos, etc.) Thanks Kristi! 😂
In the morning I counted 5 cardinals on one of several bird feeders outside. We def hope to return on future trips through this area!"

Stayed with kids","The house was beautiful and located in a secluded area! Loved sitting on rocking chairs on either porch and listen to the sounds of nature. All we had to do was bring our food and snack items to create lasting memories with our family. The kitchen table was expandable and perfect for our large family gathering and conversation which we always love to do. Carolyn was very quick with replies to my questions and let us check in earlier than expected, which we were grateful for! The description of the house and location were spot on! Only wish our trip was longer than planned as it was super relaxing."

Unfortunately there were ants in the kitchen due to left over food residue on counters and sink. Also it was obvious the upstairs bathroom toilet was not cleaned or wiped down. Carolyn was very helpful during booking and checkin. I have asked for the cleaning fee to be refunded as I don’t think it’s fair for us to pay it but she has not yet responded.

Stayed with kids","Beautiful cabin with a great location near Cumberland Mtn State Park. My family and I spent Thanksgiving here and spent lots of time at the park and exploring the area. To my surprise there is a partial view of the mountains at the back of the property. There were a couple of negatives but none that interfered with us enjoying our stay. The cabin is advertised as secluded but there are close, visible neighbors. The other is it seems the cabin is set up more for the owner than as a rental. I think it needs just a little more detail for the renter. The tv in the master bedroom is the only one that has a cable connection and it is minimal. The other tv upstairs only has a DVD player for movies. If your family enjoys watching tv together this cabin may not work for you."

Stayed with kids","This is an older house that’s been refurbished. The neighborhood is peaceful and quiet, and felt completely safe. Close enough to all the shopping we came for, but far enough away to enjoy and relax. Everything was very clean and uncluttered. The bathroom is beautifully done, but the kitchen needs some work. Some trim was missing, paint is a bit unsightly on the cabinets, and the backsplash was contact paper. Though she had lots of air fresheners, you can tell this was a smoker’s house. Didn’t bother us, but if you have allergies, I wouldn’t recommend. Not the best value, but certainly not the worst AirBnb we’ve had. To her credit, super fast response to a small problem with the water heater!"

The wood was already in place for a fire (which was super helpful to me), but I didn’t get to enjoy it because it rained a bit. The place was clean, but I really appreciated how safe I felt despite being alone most of the time. The TV placement was perfect, and everything in the tiny house flowed very easiest.

We rented this location last minute due to the snowstorm that stranded us away from home. Carolyn was gracious and quick to approve. That being said, the detailed cleaning needs to be done... the pullout bed on the couch needed cleaning, and the kitchen drawers and fridge were filled with food crumbs and smudges. Everything else was fairly clean, and having access to a washer and dryer was super helpful. The ONLY negative about this place was the evident smell of must and mold. Unfortunately , my husband and I are sensitive to mold of any kind, and so we were very stuffy the whole time...other than that we had a great experienceand just wished the detailed cleaning in the kitchen had been done, seeing as we pay a cleaning fee on top of the rent. A big thank you to our host, and her other properties look amazing as well."

The showers were a great size and y’all they have a claw foot tub!! Overall very cozy, great view of the sunrise with a Mountain View. Highly recommended house and the host are AMAZING!!

Super clean and decorated nicely for fall. Lots of nice touches, such as snacks and water waiting upon check-in. Victor was super responsive and friendly any time I had a question. The bed in the master was amazing! The best bed I have ever slept on away from home. Close to the park and minutes from downtown Crossville. I will stay here again soon."

The house was absolutely gorgeous inside and out. The front porch was great for morning coffee and relaxing in the evening. Very homey, well equipped and welcoming. Since our daughter lives in Crossville we plan on making this a regular place to stay. We were very pleased with the home and location overall. The short drive to the many parks and waterfalls was an added plus."

Let’s just say I can’t live my life without it now. 😊 This home we will definitely be returning to.

Only thing I wish was different about our stay was the length of our stay….we were on a long road trip and literally stopped to sleep, which made me sad bc this place was so cozy and beautiful. Cynthia has thought of every possible need from an extension cord to extra toiletries to a cheese grater. We loved reading all the notes left from previous guests and the painted canvases hanging around the cabin were such a nice touch! I wish we would have had the energy to paint one ourselves - maybe next time!! Thank you, Cynthia for welcoming us to your lovely cabin and for creating the perfect space for us to rest and recharge!!"

It was easy to find and upon arrival everything was in place and as expected. The beds were softer than we prefer, slept a bit more like a hammock, and although the Wi-Fi did connect and the host was helpful with that, the speed was very slow so we opted to use a hotspot for a business call. The host was very accommodating to our dog and had cute notes around the tiny home. We also enjoyed leaving our own personalized picture on the wall, which was a nice touch."

I made a couple of creations, one of which I left to hang on the wall. To be honest, I was a little worried about being warm when I walked in.. Only used the heater for a short period of time and the shed was warm the entire night! If the weather was nicer, I would have loved to spend time on the porch or around the fire pit with my best boy, Comet. I look forward to staying here again the next time I come this way (maybe longer the next time!!)"

We had our 'minimoon' here right after our wedding and it was perfect. it's bigger inside than you'd think! We were able to bring out doggos, who enjoyed their stay as well. They loved getting to run around the spacious yard and meeting their new puggy friends! As an artsy/craftsy person, the art intrigued me and drew me in to choosing this as our minimoon location. We made some art and even had our dogs make some as well! It's a perfect little get away and Cynthia was a perfect host. We loved sitting in the arbor chatting with her and playing with the pugs.

It is close to the freeway & main area of town, but very secluded. Pretty much no traffic on the road, aside from a random car or two that must live on the street. Ozone Falls is very close and beautiful. The property itself is massive & beautiful. We enjoyed exploring on the property. The cabin has 1 bedroom with a very comfortable bed. The bathroom is cozy and has great water pressure. The cabin is beautifully decorated. Andrea left a lot of valuable information about the grounds & surrounding area. I love guest book, it great to able to what others had to say as well. If we're in area again, we will for sure book with Andrea. I highly recommend! Andrea & her cabin are wonderful! Also, it gets so dark at night that star gazing is a must!"

It’s just off the beaten path, yet close to so much! At night it is very quiet inside. To the point, the Cicadas are louder than I remember them being when you are outside. You would not know they were in the trees just outside the building!
Andrea is a great host and answers any question quite quickly.

Since all the buttons were turned off and we couldn’t get the eye to go completely off, we just unplugged the stove for our stay because it was heating the house too much. The house and the location was absolutely lovely. I’m a clean freak & the house was perfect! The host was very very responsive! Loved her & her house so much and we will be back!"

Stayed a few nights","This place was amazing! It was super cute and cozy! This home was the perfect size for a romantic getaway. Even though it's a tiny home, it could definitely fit four comfortably! The host was so friendly and helpful! She communicated with us quickly and answered all of our questions. Honestly something that wasn't mentioned in the ad was one of my favorite parts. The property was adorable! There is a tiny pond with a little bridge to a little island. There's all kinds of farmy lawn decor. I hate that it was so cold because it would be such a beautiful place to take family (or couple's) photos! I honestly fell in love the moment I pulled in the driveway! Please. If you are on the fence about which place to rent, choose this one! You won't regret it! If you did rent here, don't skip reading the notebook."

Within a few miles of the interstate and restaurants, but you feel you are truly out in the country. Quiet, peaceful and can see a sky full of stars at night.
The cottage was clean and comfortable. The Roku TV worked well and had ESPN so I was able to see my favorite college football game on Saturday night.
Andrea is as warm, accommodating and responsive as any owner-host you would ever hope to stay with.
I look forward to my next opportunity to stay in Andrea's cottage!"

We enjoyed downtown Crossville, and hiking at Lilly Bluff. The internet was a little slow, not a big deal for us but if you were relying on it to do work it may be an issue. Would recommend for anyone picking up or dropping off kiddos at FlipFest."

Stayed with kids","My daughter and I enjoyed our stay at Lana's place in Crossville. Good location in the older part of Crossville, within walking distance to some nice restaurants and coffee shops. The home features excellent high-speed Wi-Fi and a great TV system. The kitchen was well-appointed. We took advantage of the free snacks and water, along with some amazing, fresh cookies. The AC worked very well, along with fans in every room if necessary. We had a small glitch with the key-lock entry when we arrived, but Lana sorted it out quickly. Two days into our stay, there was an incredibly violent storm that knocked out local power and the internet. Power was restored in a few hours and Lana and her husband went the extra mile to have the internet restored, buying a new modem to replace the one fried by a lightning strike and having the internet company come next day to ensure the system was OK. Great hosts who really care about their guests. We would certainly stay there again."

They want you to relax and enjoy your visit. Honestly, I don’t want to brag too much about Lana and her town because I don’t want ‘the world’ to come here and spoil such a lovely place and people.

Easy checkin and off street parking. Big bonus for us is she was flex to allow us early checkin if we needed it AND, she offered a traditional coffee pot and a Keurig! We are coffee pot fans and it’s difficult to find Air BnB’s that offer that anymore, much less both. Thank you Lana for the great stay. We will be back!"

Snacks, waters, board games, makeup wipes, toiletries, and kitchen supplies were special details. Blankets were abundant for those who like to be cozy. Easy communication and when I failed to check the right drawer to find the hair dryer, Lana responded quickly and was ready to remedy it if needed. Walkable to downtown.

The house is located within walking distance of downtown restaurants and activities, but also completely private. The space is wonderful - lots of room for a family to have gathering spaces and privacy both. The kitchen is huge and well stocked. We especially enjoyed relaxing on the back deck. Highly recommend this host and home!"
