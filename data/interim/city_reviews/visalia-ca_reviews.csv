Group trip",Paola’s space is so beautiful and homey! I couldn’t have asked for a better stay in Visalia. Close to all the great shops and restaurants downtown Visalia! Highly recommend trying out House of JuJu downtown Visalia for some yummy food and sweet staff! The home is very spacious for a 2 bedroom and a great backyard. The kitchen was so cute and had everything we needed and then some! The pool was a dream also! 10/10 💗

Stayed with kids",I want to thank the host for having my family and my daughter's friends over. I am from Visalia and I was looking for a house in town to just celebrate as a family of 6 (4 small kids under the age of 11) My daughter just wanted to swim I found this place perfect for what I was looking for. Love the house clean and very welcoming I felt at home I used the kitchen as if I was home I made Mexican food called huaraches with tinga de pollo my daughter's favorite food felt comfortable cooking there. The pool all the kids loved the pool I loved that I still was cooking and keeping a close eye on the kids swimming. The house was amazing they had extra blankets my kids just fell asleep on the comfortable living room carpet watching movies tired from swimming all evening. The beds were super comfortable. I already recommended this place to a friend of mine I would love to return and maybe rent it all weekend to enjoy the pool a bit longer.

I was very impressed with how well the kitchen was stocked with everything we needed to cook our food. The pool was beautiful and warm! Very clean house! My feet weren’t dirty when walking around the house! Beds were big and comfortable! All the towels smelt amazing! I have nothing bad to say! Thank you!

We enjoyed the cleanliness and all the comforts available in the caravan. Heating, hot water, functional kitchen and even Netflix TV!
Good location to reach the Sequoia . Many shops nearby. Luckily we hadn't booked in the park because the snowy many roads were closed. But we were still able to enjoy!
Hosts are very responsive to every problem and are always ready to answer any question you may have. Communication is really easy! Really a lovely couple!
Thanks for the delicious oranges!

We finally decided to try an air b&b as the hotels were absolutely horrible. To say that Miss Lisa made us feel right at home would be an understatement. Very accommodating, very responsive, and very proactive! We will not be staying hotels any longer. The only reason we didn’t extend our stay is because it had already been reserved. I can’t recommend Lisa enough!"

One thing to note, we had accidentally broken one of the windows. Lisa and her husband were very understanding and took immediate concern about our safety. We explained how it happened, and they were more worried about if it affected our stay than about the window itself. A huge plus with us!! We all came up with a solution to rectify things and parted on a high note. We really appreciate how they handled the situation. We would be excited to come back and enjoy a stay again! Highly recommended!"

Stayed over a week","Deene's place was a true GEM! It has been masterfully curated and is a place that I would consider staying at again if need be for work! That being said, we did have some hiccups here and there with the wifi (2.5-35 Mbps) that made working from home inconsistent, but we did our best to work through the problem together; this was just a minor inconvenience that shouldn't be an issue if you bring along your mobile hotspot or use your phone as a hotspot. You can also work at the wonderful Component Coffee Shop; their breakfast burrito is a MUST! Also, this is a GREAT spot if you are a traveling nurse or locums physician. Quiet, peaceful, private garage and entrance, and a 6-minute drive to Kaweah Delta! Deene was exceptionally responsive, a gracious host, and made sure I had all I needed (laundry, coffee, towels, toiletries etc.) I highly recommend it if you appreciate a high-quality resting place while exploring Visalia and Sequoia National Park."

Stayed a few nights","Sabrina was really great. Excellent communicator and detailed with check-in process. Easy checkout process. The place was beautiful and very clean and had everything you’d need to cook up some things/store your food. My friend and I rented for a few days stay. Was very comfortable and peaceful neighborhood. Only 2 things I would recommend is:
1. Maybe a little firmer mattress for the rooms. My friend and I stayed in two different rooms and both of us had the same issue with our neck/back cramp due to the mattress being too soft.
2. Since there isn’t really a “communal” lounge area, maybe put a sitting chair in rooms 2 and 3 as well like room 1 had. Would have been nice to sit and relax during our down time without having to sit at the dining table, on the bed, or having to intrude my friend’s space in room 1 lol.
Lots of stores nearby to buy any essentials and restaurants/coffee shops close by.
Overall excellent home and would stay here again!"

The check in was smooth and easy and Sabrina was kind enough to let us know ahead to use the map on the Airbnb to avoid confusion. The place is pretty strategic as there’s a Target nearby to stock up some essentials if you’d like. The place was clean and tidy. There’s plenty of restaurants nearby too, mostly fast foods for quick bite. It’s definitely recommended and worth a stay if you are planning to visit the NPs and do not wanna stay in the park area."

The primary bedroom allowed my brother and I to hand out, but not be cramped and the kitchen area gave exactly what we needed. Beautiful home, lots of space and would definitely book again!"

Great stay, everything was new and super clean! Fridge was super clean and it was nice that there was a little fridge inside the master bedroom as well. The home itself is in a gold location if you need to go to Starbucks or target. Would stay here again!"

Stayed one night","My friends and I were visiting the area in need of a single overnight stay after a birthday party in Tulare.
Rather than cram ourselves into a hotel with 1 room and 2 beds, we found Sabrina’s clean, modern 3-bedroom was a better use of the money!
The location is safe, parking easy right on the driveway and the home is practically perfectly inside and out.
While the bedrooms were all well equipped with comfortable beds and TVs, this home does not have a common space to lounge so we ended up having our morning coffee sitting around the master bedroom. Not a deal breaker for us but might be important to others.
The kitchen was compact but immaculate. While it did have the full capacity for preparing food, it was lacking a Brita filter or other method to be confident in sourcing drinkable water. The tap water was safe to brush teeth and shower with but had an off-putting taste to it so that was the only drawback.
Overall, it was much better than a hotel. Thank you, Sabrina!"

Just a wonderful set-up. We felt right at home from the moment we arrived.
We used Reuben’s place as a base for exploring Sequoia and King’s Canyon National Parks: while there was a fair bit of driving to and from the Parks, we thought it was a great base from which to visit the Parks. And Reuben was super responsive to any questions we had.
We really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend Reuben’s place to anyone visiting the area."

The house is so beautifully designed, with lots of well-thought out components.
Rueben & his wife are exceptional hosts - they really went above and beyond and were very generous with both their time and how stocked their house was.
The location itself is really good. Super peaceful, safe and nice to walk around.
If I am in Visalia again, I will definitely try stay here, without a doubt.
AirBnB should allow for 6 stars for hosts like Rueben & his wife :)"

Close enough for us to enjoy the national parks, we picked this place because it seemed homey, had additional luxuries, and had the air of a good place to relax after some longer days on our feet. Not only did it meet these expectations but it excelled in every way. With personal touches, luxurious comfort, modern amenities, and a beautiful aesthetic, this place was worth every penny and more. Reuben is clearly a detail-oriented host who cares about his property andguests. Highly recommend for anyone visiting Sequoia NP or the Visalia/Fresno areas. Excellent stay and we will hopefully be back."

Beds and pillows UBER comfy, good powerful shower, heavenly stocked kitchen…. Honestly it was dreamy.
Huge amount of shops nearby.

We were his first guests and I am thoroughly impressed with the job he did with the place. Not only did he turn a home into a fun space with a tree house, little details and Easter eggs to find, access to his golf cart, and canoe, but the house was stocked beyond belief. As if that wasn’t enough, Reuben was also a very friendly host who checked in here and there and was proactive of our needs in every sense of the word - we felt truly taken care of. I would give Reuben 11/10 stars for his accommodations! Thanks Reuben!"

The space is “shotgun” style, and though plenty of space is offered, one should know there is only one window on the property which is located in the bedroom at the end of the property. The internet was extremely slow, so if one is planning to work from home while staying, it can be difficult to do work that requires a lot of bandwidth; I was clocking roughly 3-5 Mbps (i.e., Teams, WebEx, etc.)
The place was stocked well and we would consider staying again if ever in the area!"

Very basic amenities, so bring what you may need or want, ie coffee. There is no outdoor furniture of any sort to enjoy the beautiful backyard so bring beach chairs! Also the play structure is worn and could use some love. Other than that we had a great stay and would gladly stay again! Stephan was a responsive and accommodating host!"

Stephan was attentive and answered some questions we had right away. The furniture is clean and comfortable. Only cons for us- The bed linens were a little scratchy and seemed cheap, plus the kitchen was bare bones in terms of cooking supplies. There was also a Febreeze plug in that was so strong we had to unplug and air the house out. But those are very minor details compared to everything that was great about our stay."

Jeanette is super responsive and friendly, providing clear and easy check-in and check-out instructions. The rooms were spacious and beautiful, and we encountered no issues during our stay. We really loved the cozy vibes of the living room and the gorgeous swimming pool, which was stunning at night with the fairy lights on. Everyone, including my sister who was sleeping on the sofa bed, was really comfortable. This has been our favourite stop on our road trip so far, we absolutely adore this place. 10/10 would recommend! 💯"

The house has absolutely everything you need for a comfortable life: a lot of different dishes, blankets, a whole closet of various board games. We stayed with a large group of 7 adults and 2 small children. Everyone was very happy and full of impressions. We felt at home here, and will definitely return to this house in the spring and summer when we go to Sequoia Park again. Thank you very much!!!! You will forever remain in our hearts!! 🫶🙏"

If your looking to stretch out more the next room has a king bed with a large window you can look out at night and see the sky. Perfect getaway for couples, family, friends, or enjoying it all to yourself! The Hosts are locals and take pride in ensuring guests have the best experience during their stay!

The home is located close to grocery, restaurants, and coffee shops. Kermit and Jeanette were amazing hosts, proactive in checking in with us. They also provided some helpful information for driving directions to our next destination

We had our grandblessings with us, I asked about a pack and play and they bought one. We arrived and there was a highchair also there.
There are tons of cooking items to use, so you can do all your cooking at the house.
The pool and outside was fabulous area for us to use.
I personally used 2 of the beds and they were both restful and comfortable to use.
We ended up needing the house a day early, it was available and they approved the change, which was very helpful.
This house was very clean, huge windows, great host! We will need a house again in the future in Visalia and I hope it is available!!!"

Stayed with kids","This home was a short walk away from our family members home, so it was a perfect place for our family unit to unwind with our newborn after the daily festivities.
I could see how the cold floor tiles would be imperative during the hot summer months in keeping you cool! The backyard oasis appeared serene but not recently used. There were many spider webs, a non working fountain and the gazebo umbrella was badly torn on one side but the bushes are well manicured. My kid kicked a left soccer ball around for a few minutes.
We did not make use of the stocked kitchen or the bunk beds really but the 3 bedroom house was extremely spacious for our needs this time around.
The garage door did not work, so you must park in the driveway. The stove was missing two knobs, but we didn’t have a need to cook.
The kitchen sink water gets extremely hot, so beware when you are washing dishes/hands.
Check in was a breeze. In order to lock the front door/when you leave, you must push the Yale button"

Our host Aaron was extremely responsive, check in and check out was a breeze and the home was beautifully, but simply decorated.

We went on morning walks on a walking path right down the street. It accommodated 7 adults very well. One 17 year old slept on the couch because he didn’t want a top bunk. Aaron has this place very clean and comfortable! Awesome backyard where you could bbq, but it was 105° when we were there!"

It was in the low 30’s at night so I was glad I brought my small space heater because the house is older and it gets pretty chilly! Amber also had a small space heater in the closet if you needed one. Fenced in front and backyard was definitely convenient! Overall it was a great stay! There are quite a few homeless people around but they don’t bother you. I look forward to booking one of her houses again soon!

Stayed a few nights","I love this house!!
This was by far the cleanest Airbnb I’ve stayed at. The house was immaculate and stylish in its decor. It had all the cozy amenities we required for our many nights in town. The town itself is quaint and charming, it has multiple unique shops, breweries (sequoia and Barrel House were favorites) and restaurants (Gorilla Quesadilla was delicious!!)
ALL walkable by a few blocks from the bungalow.
Visalia has so much pride in their town/community you can tell by how clean and well maintained it is. Everyone we encountered was extremely kind and welcoming and helpful with local activity recommendations.
We traversed to both Kings Canyon and Sequoia for some day hikes and were pleased to be so close to the entrance (40-45 min to Three Rivers/Sequoia entrance).
I cannot say enough about this house.. it was the welcoming oasis we needed for our West Coast outdoor adventures.
I would definitely recommend!!"

Location-wise, this was the perfect place from which to access both Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. We drove 1.5 hours to the Giant Trees section of Sequoia (though the entrance and foothills section come up after only driving about 30 minutes) , and we drove 1 hour and 20 minutes to the Grant Grove section of Kings Canyon. If you visit Kings Canyon, definitely do a horse ride at Grant Grove Stables; this was a highlight of our trip! Our family actually preferred these parks to Yosemite. Not only are the crowds more manageable, but the weather is cooler and more pleasant...and the sequoias are awesome! The drives to both parks are scenic and beautiful. Visalia is a convenient location with a great Walmart Super Center for any supplies you may need. We would definitely stay here again!"

It lives so much larger than its actual square footage. It has beautiful hardwood floors, seemingly original. The kitchen has everything you need to cook any meal. The bedrooms are spacious and comfortable. It was great having access to a washer and dryer. The house is located on a quiet street near the historic district. We walked to a nearby restaurant for dinner and then to another spot for ice cream. Thanks to Amber's brochures on the local sites, we knew we were also walking distance to the Sequoia Legacy Tree. Be sure to check it out. We also did a quick tour of The Darling, a boutique hotel that was once the courthouse. So much history and small town charm near a comfortable and beautiful home."

It was so nice to relax in the comfortable living room and watch shows at night after being out all day. My husband enjoyed playing Galaga on the old Nintendo. While the home appeared small from the outside, it was incredibly spacious! I couldn’t believe how lovely it was inside, maybe the most well decorated and clean Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in! I loved Amber’s framed house rules and tips in the kitchen. I also loved the body wash, shampoo and conditioner bottles labeled in the bathroom. I wish more folks would do that! It looks so nice and is a great touch! We walked to the downtown area for food and drinks a few times and had an easy drive up to sequoia national park.

Beautiful natural lighting and a small thing that that I'm always happy about - a showerhead with perfect water pressure! The area isn't the best so I'd suggest to avoid leaving valuables in the car and skip evening walks, but we didn't have any issues. If I'm in the area again and need a place to stay, I'll book this one again immediately!"

I was also clean eating so the kitchen was great for meal prepping. It came equipped with spices, pans, storage containers, coffee supplies, etc. My family enjoyed morning walks in and around the neighborhood. It felt really safe and was so nice and quiet. We would definitely stay here again."

The bedrooms and living spaces felt like being at home. It isn't walkable to dining, shops, etc., but there is a lot within a short drive, and we enjoyed going for walks around the neighborhood in the mornings; it was a pretty area. Thanks for a great stay!"

Stayed a few nights","Overall it was a great experience and rental.
However, the one glaring flaw was the cleaning fee cost, coupled with requiring the guests to empty the trash and other cleaning.
We washed all our dishes, emptied all the trash picked up after ourselves and were still left with a140$ cleaning fee and a 65$ service fee. That put the fee’s at more than half of total the rentals cost.
The place was great, we were happy with the location and the accommodations. The only part that was a disappointment were the fee’s for cleaning in relation to the what was required of the guest."

Kitchen was very nice with lots of counter space and everything you needed. Gerrit was super responsive via messaging and initially introduced himself in person upon arrival. He then left us alone unless we needed something. I will definitely stay again if the need arises and house is available.

However, this Airbnb stood out from others where we have stayed because of the great hosts! Unexpectedly for the hosts, the power was shut off by the electric company for several hours one morning (without any notice to them). They quickly were able to get a generator over to the property and restore power so that our stay was not really impacted at all.
We highly recommend this home and the hosts!"

Mostly quiet except for a bit of distant freeway noise but white noise machine covered it. Conscience host who was responsive and friendly! He lives right across the street so perfect if you have a question or concern. Highly recommend and can’t think of anything I’d change. Perfect home base for exploring the parks and much more affordable than Three Rivers.

Beds/sofas comfy, kitchen had all the basics, nothing we needed to worry about with a 3yo on the loose. Really cute, fenced in backyard with seating, grill and lights, that we didn’t use because of the damp and cold weather, but we hope to stay here again in warmer months to fully enjoy. Gerrit was always quick to respond, readily available to assist."

Stayed a few nights","Little Green House only ‘little’ in the title! A true home with ample space for our family of 4 including 2 boys, 18 & 22 who said “it was a dream!” Comfortable beds, impeccably clean, custom/craftsman touches throughout, spaces to play games, kitchen with upgraded amenities (including a gas stove!), and the most charming neighborhood that we fell in love with. Terri & Gerrit were true ‘super hosts’ - available and fast communication. Absolutely no criticism to add. If you’re on the fence, BOOK IT! You won’t be sorry! We WILL be back!"

The only thing I would tell other guests is to bring a curtain and tension rod for the window that faces the neighbors’s door. Other than that you will love this place. I will be staying here again in the future, if it’s available. Pleasant stay, nice neighborhood, great hosts! :)"

Stayed a few nights","If you're on the fence BOOK NOW! Then come read this review. Seriously tho, this spot reminds me of why I love Airbnb so much. If you're thinking of booking let me help you make that decision. The home is recently remodeled with modern and stylish finishings. The entire space has been tastfully decorated. The floor plan makes the space feel big and open, so much natural light. We were a party of 4 (+ and infant) and it was more then enough space for us all to be super comfortable. If you love to cook then this kitchen is just what you need, tons of counter and storage space and everything you need to make a full on meal. We cooked all of our meals each day and it was a breeze. The appliances are high end (bosch) and worked wonderfully. The backyard space is to die for, gorgeous bistro lights are strung over the backyard making for the perfect night time ""chill"" spot. We spent time out there each night. The host has provided some thoughtful touches throughout making the stay that much easier. The hosts were super responsive and easily approachable for any questions or needs. I come to the area often and we won't stay anywhere else moving forward. I look forward to seeing the success this space will surely have."

It’s still quite a bit of a drive to the Sequoias compared to let’s say a spot in Three Rivers, but we ended up choosing this spot because of the great vibes that the photos presented. They had coffee for us to make and a fridge with stocked condiments. I’ll be returning for sure in better financial situations!"

While we went for Sequoia, Visalia was also a fun town to come back to and enjoy a meal after a full day of hiking.

Andrew and Tori was very kind and responsive. I would 100% stay there again, and id recommend anyone looking for a relaxing, private little getaway to do the same."

Stayed a few nights","Andrew welcomed us in a very friendly way. Arrival is well described. The accommodation was clean and nicely decorated. Some things could have been a little better processed (e.g. Silicon joints and mounted shelves on the wall in the bath). Unfortunately, we were probably there at the insect time, there were an incredible number of mosquitos in the area, which unfortunately ruined the experience at the hot tub and in the really nicely decorated outdoor area. However, Andrew had provided and had insect spray ready and attached screens to the windows."

Stayed with kids","The Tiny House is beautiful and comfortable. It was clean and for us it was honestly very toddler friendly, beds and couches were safely climbable and the majority of the amenities provided were well out of arms reach, any cabinets that could be opened were easily blocked with our luggage.
The hosts are communicative and honest, make sure to read the entire house manual though because the visit we had from billy the bluejay at night definitely gave us a little scare.
For anyone traveling with kids or toddlers this place is absolutely amazing, however it is 45 minutes from the Sequoia’s (which the description is transparent about) PLUS it takes nearly 2 hours to get to the General Sherman Tree from the Entrance so definitely plan with extra snacks and entertainment.
Overall we just loved our stay, we felt so at home. Everything was so clean, detailed, private and calm. I could not possibly say more good things but this place has good reviews for a reason!!"

Stayed a few nights",Tiny House was perfect!! So cozy and clean!!! Our main objective for the trip was hiking in Sequoia. The park entrance is 45 minutes away so just be sure to add in your drive time to the trails. We started with Moro Rock trail and it was about a two hour drive in total from tiny house to the museum parking lot and then a 3 mile hike to Moro rock but the drive once you’re in the park is beautiful. Andrew gave some great hiking recommendations and we loved the hot tub after a long day of hiking. The tiny house is great if you don’t want to stay close to the park where there is a lot of traffic and people and the bed was SO comfy!!!

The shower was so lovely too, it made the whole stay feel extremely relaxing. Definitely recommend staying here if you’re looking to go to Sequoia National Park. Can’t wait to come back! ✨"

Stayed a few nights","Andrew's place was absolutely wonderful. Every review was fantastic and they are all exactly right. From the hot tub, to the luxurious towels, to the fire pit, to the personal touches, the place is a perfect stay for anyone needing a homebase while exploring the parks! The communication was so quick that you have an answer to your question before you even put your phone down."

Stayed a few nights","We had a great stay at the Tiny House. For it being in someone’s backyard, it felt very private and secluded. Everything inside the home was well taken care of and they made it very comfortable. The owners even left some ice cream and champagne for us! Highly suggest staying here if you are Interested"

Stayed with kids","Excellent stay. Super clean, wonderful accommodations, and very responsive hosts. House was everything posted and more. We arrived after dark and things were well lighted and it was easy get in. The house was “set” and very welcoming. Neighborhood is very quiet. Great jumping off point for SEKI. Downtown Visalia has a great variety of affordable restaurants."

Stayed one night","We only stayed for one night - how i wished we stayed for more!
After spending the entire day in Sequoia and a seemingly long drive to Visalia, we were greeted to the accommodation with the AC and lights on for our arrival! We were also greeted to a note with our names, a gift and basic information for the place. The guestbook and map was a great touch. It has everything you need to make you feel right at home!
10/10 highly recommended.
P.S. The hot tub is highly recommended"
