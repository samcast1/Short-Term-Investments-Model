Stayed with a pet","We extended our beach stay at the Cozy Cottage at Waverly Place. We had our fur baby with us, so the fully-fenced yard was a blessing to our curious pup. Melissa gave great local recommendations, all dog-friendly. She thought of everything to make our stay home-like, starting with proactive communication that made finding the cottage easy. We are thankful for Melissa (and Rowdy’s) hospitality!"

Stayed a few nights","Awesome place for two people for the weekend. I think any more may be a tight squeeze unless it’s kids. Melissa was extremely responsive and fast with any questions or requests, including letting us know all the info ahead of time. The actual space is a nice guest house behind the main house with a nice patio as well. Very clean (linens, towels, counters, and floors as well) and you can tell Melissa really cares about it. Not only was she super nice and informative, we also got to meet Rowdy who was super sweet and will let you pet him all you want. Awesome stay!"

Stayed with a pet","They left the door unlocked for us, which made me feel very uncomfortable because someone could have been in there since we were planning to arrive very late. It was raining and there was nothing to pick up water with. The first night we all had to sleep uncomfortably on a small bed because I wasn't told until the next day where the air mattress was. Honestly the listing is more comfortable for 2 people but not more than that in my opinion, its very small. The host does not allow smoking, which is fine, we didnt smoke anywhere near the property.
Other than that the location is pretty good and the unit was clean."

The place was clean and had all the basic amenities. Three hours before your check-in time, Melissa sends you a message as to how to locate the property and how to access the Airbnb. We didn’t spend much time at the Airbnb since we were out exploring CC and the near by areas. But it was a nice little cozy den for two people to come back to after a long day out."

The place is only 10 mins away from the nearest beach! The best part was that it was furry friendly. It was very nice and we definitely recommend. 😊

The neighborhood was quiet and I felt safe. I had one issue with batteries and Monica responded within seconds and resolved the issue which to me was not a really an issue but still I was very pleased at the fast response and proactive that was taken for batteries for the remote. My noise machine broke and I was pleasantly surprised to find box fans! I was able to cook and unwind everyday of my stay. The home made this stressful trip a place of peace for me.

Stayed with a pet","Most all of the airbnb rentals I've stayed in are smaller than they look in the pictures. This is the first time an airbnb was larger than it looked in the pictures. It felt spacious and comfortable. It's not huge but the space is laid out so well. This is also one of the cleanest airbnb rentals I've had the pleasure of staying at. For a pet friendly house on the coast, it was miraculously clean! I didn't see a grain of sand anywhere. The backyard was also much larger than I expected. Between the tall privacy fence, the picnic table, hammock, and a few trees-- it felt tranquil and inviting. We were two adults and two pups and we all loved the accommodations. I was ready to move in! It's the epitome of why I prefer homes over hotels--a kitchen with a fridge and dishwasher, washer and dryer, private backyard, closet space, and cold AC. Monica added the special touches with coffee and snacks! <3"

Less than 5 minutes to my family’s houses and was exactly like the photos. Very pet friendly and was the perfect place for them to run around. I loved everything about the house, especially the hammock! Would recommend to my other family members who travel to corpus often."

It was also quite nice to be able for our family of five spread out over the two bedrooms and the main room, instead of all being crammed into a single hotel room.
One more additional thing was the flexible check-in. We were traveling from a great distance, and adding in time every time we stopped. Being allowed to check in when we got there without having to endure a hotel reception desk was fantastic! Using a code instead of a key was super-helpful, too!"

Kitchen was very well stocked with cutlery and other needed items for eating and cooking.
Lots of storage/closet space so very good for longer stays or business traveling like I was doing. I was able to hang up what I needed to.
AC doesn't cool very quickly and it was over 80 degrees when I arrived late Saturday afternoon. It took quite a long time to cool down so I could relax and sleep.
Be sure you bring your own bath towels! The ones provided are super small and a size 2 can use them but no one larger.
No covered parking and lots of construction going on in the complex so there was limited parking available...especially with no reserved space for the unit. Coming and going was definitely difficult and construction isn't something I would've chosen to deal with, had I known ahead of time."

We really feel like both the listing and our friends undersold us on this place. It was peaceful, beautiful, and just the right size for four adults and two (very) little kids to enjoy the scenery at the coast. We hadn't even left yet and were thinking of days we could sneak away from real life to come back to this place. Thanks for a rejuvenating weekend full of sea air and crashing waves!"

Liked the fact that because it is a corner unit if it was too sunny or windy on one side of the building I could switch sides. Comfortable patio furniture, I spent hours reading and watching the waves. The waves were pretty big so we didn’t go swimming in the Gulf, but the heated pool was nice to swim in."

A few steps down the concrete water barrier and you are in the sand. The walkway right out the patio is nice to walk in the morning or at sunset as well. We had a bonfire on the beach one night which was great. Condo has a shared pool and hot tub as well. Kitchen has everything needed. Rooms and beds were clean and very comfortable beds. Our toddler loved the toys and fort building couch. Turntable with a good selection of vinyls is a nice touch too! we had a great time. I don't think you could find a much better place to stay on Padre Island than here. We would definitely come back.

It was a tranquil time of year, and the privacy was great for a peaceful stay. The only unexpected adventure was the mosquitos. They were out in full force as my morning run as I got bombarded, and they were so bad in the evening that we couldn't sit outside to enjoy the view. Of course, this is mother nature, and by no means controllable by the host, it was just bad timing for us. Overall, it was a great experience."

Our daughter had a blast with the Polaroid camera. Colleen had great recommendations for our staycation, and the Island House itself is adorable. Staff at the front office are very friendly, with things you may need if you forget something. We also enjoyed the warm salty pool. The dark sky made it great for watching the meteor shower."

It was so easy to walk to the beach to setup and spend the day. There aren't a lot of people in that area of the beach because cars cannot drive onto the beach. There are a lot of people walking around on the path outside the condo and on the beach.
Colleen was always very responsive and provided a really wonderful wine and charcuterie gift upon our arrival. The polaroid was fun and made us want to get our own. There were also plenty of games and puzzles to play inside.
I would have no hesitation in recommending this place for your visit to the beach."

I mean there was chairs and umbrellas, to kites and firewood. The kitchen was stocked along with the bathrooms. This made our trip so much less stressful! My daughters and I where so grateful to have such a wonderful host on top of the beautiful place. Colleen even dropped off extra film for the Polaroid my daughter enjoyed using. She communicated immediately any time I reached out or had questions. Colleen's welcoming gift contained a tasty and beautiful assembled charcuterie along with a bottle of wine. I couldn't have asked for a better host or a better place to stay for a well needed get away. The kids always had something to do and that gave me time to relax."

Stayed with kids","Colleen’s condo is truly such a gem. Wonderful views, beautiful decorated and well stocked with everything we needed to keep the kids entertained inside and out. The beach itself was a little disappointing, which is certainly no fault of Colleen’s. There is a steep concrete “stair”/barrier to get down to the actual water, and the water often crashed right up against it so it wasn’t easy to walk on the beach with toes in the sand. Also, I’ve never been to such a trashed up beach. It was depressing. Again, none of this is Colleen’s fault, but I think it should be known that there is a steep, difficult concrete stair barrier between the condo and the water."

Stayed with kids",The property is absolutely wonderful. The host is very communicative. The property was immaculately clean when we arrived for check-in. All of the amenities are fantastic and such nice touches. We loved the personality of the building. The beach is steps away from the patio. We particularly liked that the beachfront is a stretch of beach where cars are not allowed to drive. We will definitely return!

Stayed with kids","This is such a wonderful place for families. This was our first trip as a family of four and it was great. My three year old loved the bunk beds. The on-site travel crib for my 6 month old was great because it was one less thing we needed to pack. It’s so refreshing to have a place catered to families. I love the attention to details such as having a nice bottle of wine chilling when we arrived, the gift of baby lotions, and the little candies that my toddler loved. Being so close to the beach was biggest plus. We will definitely be back."

Stayed with kids","Awesome views! Has everything you need! Nicely put together house booklet (local info, instructions, etc) Record player was a nice bonus for me! Our family of 5 enjoyed our beach time every day and it was so great to be able to walk across the grass and sidewalk and step down the sea wall to the beach. Also allows for easy retrieval of chairs, canopy, games, etc from the condo. Great location and the beach is borderline private for the Island House community since vehicles cannot park in the section behind the building and that stretches down to the left (north) for a good bit. And you can just take a short walk that direction and set up camp there if you want to be by yourself on the beach. We also grill some nights on vacation and the Island House has a nice setup with 5 grills close to the pool that were recently updated and cleaned daily by the staff. Lastly, great communication from Colleen! Thanks for everything!"

The vibe is so relaxing & the decor fresh, clean & cozy! You can’t beat the view, I seriously could sit there all day if the beach wasn’t calling! Don’t worry about any noise from neighbors, cause sounds machines are provided if you are a light sleeper. Lots of fun games, records & we enjoyed the binoculars too! It was hard to pack up & head home, can’t wait to stay again! 💕"

It is very spacious with a tremendous view. Being a corner unit gives you and enormous view and 4 patio chairs gave you plenty of places to just sit and relax. The papasan chair look so cute and are very comfortable for reading or napping. The beach is right outside the slider doors. The kitchen and bathrooms are supplied with everything you need. My daughters loved the record player and the snacks and movies available from the front desk. The swimming pool is wonderfully warm and clean. The condominium staff are very friendly and helpful."

The corner condo unit is on a small section of beach closed to traffic. So great for our family getaway. We could just slide open the door and the kids could run outside! Plus there was a lovely heated pool in the complex which we used daily as well. Colleen also supplied everything you needed to make the most of the beach, chairs, umbrella, plenty of towels, etc. There's super comfy patio furniture and hose for cleaning off before coming inside which was very convenient. So many thoughtful touches inside the apartment, from s'mores ingredients, extra toiletries, welcome snacks, games, vinyl records, and of course plush towels and linens. We literally didn't leave our condo for 5 days it was so wonderful."

Everything was nearby (Walmart around the corner) so it was easy for us to purchase groceries and cook in the Casita. Although we had to take work with us, we had an amazing time working with that incredible view. We laid on the hammock quite a bit and just enjoyed the view. We had such a relaxing weekend, and we definitely correlate it to Karl’s Casita. Thank you for allowing us to stay. We will most definitely be back."

Stayed a few nights","The Casita is absolutely beautiful and has everything you need. Karl was very welcoming and showed us around the property himself. Cha-cha is his super sweet little pup who was happy to greet us when we arrived. I wish we had had more time to just stay at the casita and relax. Next time we are in Corpus, we would absolutely love to stay here, it was top notch."

Stayed a few nights","Karl was just awesome! Super friendly and very accommodating. Karl just went above and beyond at every turn. The facilities were very private and the inside of the casita had hand crafted cypress cabinets and terracotta tile throughout. The whole compound was surrounded by a mid-height stucco wall and the grounds were beyond elegant.
We were in corpus to fish and towed a double jetski trailer. Karl let us flush our skis daily. We felt completely safe leaving our gear on our crafts overnight. The last morning we fished right of the backyard and caught 3 reds and 3 trout. One trout was 27 inches!!
To those potential renters you will absolutely love this place. Please, as a word of caution, take care of how you treat this place. Clean up after yourself. Don’t abuse this beautiful place. This is Karl’s home and he intentionally and willfully goes out of his way to make it feel like it is yours as well. God bless you Karl and thanks for your hospitality and friendship. God speed brother."

Karl thought of everything a guest might need and ensured we had a great time. The location is close to everything you could want, but we enjoyed just hanging out at the casita. We hope to come back."

Caught a few fish off the dock and loved the closeness of the beach. We even got to drive our jeep down to Shell Beach. Unfortunately we didn’t get a chance to take a dip in the pool. Maybe next time. :)

Stayed with kids","This place was a great getaway for our family. The bed was very comfortable! There were plenty of linens and towels for use. Lots of bathroom items in case you forgot something. Kitchen had lots of cooking utensils. We appreciated having a washer and dryer handy. The patio area was great, my husband loves fishing and really enjoyed being able to cast right off the back porch. The only drawback is that it is located right next to a bar and grille that plays live music. We enjoyed the music actually we just were hoping for a little more privacy. We did bring a sound machine for our 2 year old son and did not notice the noise once we went to bed but I’m sure without the sound machine we would have heard the music. Lisa was very responsive with any questions we had. I felt it was a good value for the area. There was a beach right by the airbnb but we opted to drive a little further out and enjoy padre island national seashore which was much less crowded. We had a great time!"

Stayed one night","My friend and I had a lovely stay at the bungalow! It was cozy and inviting and made my first stay in Corpus Christi so cozy. By far, what I enjoyed the most about this home was its location. The neighborhood is wonderful and you can easily walk to the pier which we did.
This location is filled with charm.
As a believer, it was also wonderful to see that they had left a Bible for us to take.
In the evening, you’ll want to make sure the AC fan is on cool and set where the air flow is the highest. We did wake up feeling a bit stuffy in the bedroom (as it felt the air didn’t reach there) but as soon as we adjusted the air con we were able to sleep better.
Otherwise the bed itself was very comfortable.
Thank you for a wonderful stay!"

The bungalow has a great vibe. Everything you might need or want was provided. This stay surpasses quite a few of those I've stayed at. Frankly, this is why I stay at airbnbs with the hopes of a personal stay and not what you find at the chain hotels. Larry & Beth have a wonderful place and I will return!"

Very cozy and we happened to see the hosts when we arrived, and they greeted us but left us to our space as well. We did get awakened by the chickens at about 8:30, but that in itself has a charm to it! We loved our stay and would totally go back."

The only thing is, be careful opening your car door when you park on the side of the street if you have a low car, as you could damage your door on impact with the higher curbs! Thankfully, we noticed that before it was too late. Definitely not a deal breaker, just a warning."

Their home was beautifully decorated, nice and clean, and in a good area, minutes away from the beach. I was fortunate to eat at Hester’s diner, which was delicious and offered a healthy variety of meals.
Their garden and animals helped create an atmosphere that was safe and inviting. It was inspiring to see the past diary log of each persons stay and to include my own. Would recommend this beach bungalow to anyone!
I loved how Larry and Beth gave me a cute note with a Bible to share the good news about the gospel. It is wonderful to see fellow Christian’s sharing the love.

Stayed a few nights","I’m so happy my friend and I chose to stay at Larry & Beth’s bungalow. We’ve always stayed at hotels and although they are very nice, we loved the comfy vibe of staying at the bungalow. It was peaceful and just a few blocks from the water.
We appreciated receiving a bible as a gift and thought it was no coincidence we chose the bungalow, because one of our purposes for our trip was to pray over the city of Corpus Christi.
When I return here I’d definitely stay at the bungalow again. I loved the water pressure too! I have very thick hair and that can make or break my trip… especially if it involves the beach!
The bungalow was the perfect size for me and my friend and I did bring an air mattress for me which fit perfectly in the living area.
I love how close the bungalow was to everything and that McGee Beach was right there because that’s the only beach cars aren’t driven on and that was very important to me.
When I text Beth she was quick to respond and she has a great sense of humor! Thanks for being amazing hosts Larry & Beth!"

Stayed a few nights","I think this place meets the value paid. We were in town for the Beach to Bay relay and this was cheaper than a hotel, included a mini kitchen, and was only a mile from the beach. Well decorated and very clean. Bed was a little small for two people and bathroom smelled (seemed like more of a plumbing thing than a cleanliness issue though - the space was well-kept and cleaned). Wasn't able to turn bedroom fan on at night while light was off. Overall, minor inconveniences in a great space for the price."

The pool is very comfortable and beautiful. We use the grill area without a problem.
The apartment has the essentials to have a pleasant stay and the right tools for cooking.
The only detail we had was that there was a lot of noise in the apartment that was upstairs and it was heard, however it is understood that it cannot be controlled by the host.
Outside of that detail, it's perfect to relax and unwind.
This place is perfect, like and clean, we would definitely come back again. Thank you so much for everything!"

The only downside is that the unit was quite bare bones. We ended up eating out way more than we anticipated because the kitchen didn't really have enough accessories to cook much at all.

Stayed a few nights",Great spot with a sunrise through the bedroom windows and an excellent sunset view on the patio. A nice breeze off the water provided the perfect temperature to keep the windows open for our spring break. The kitchen was nice to cook in but also check out The Angry Marlin for dinner or La Palma for breakfast. The beaches are nearby and easily accessed.

Water. Fishing on the dock is only steps from the apartment. This renovated condo is clean, great views, new appliances and comfortable bed."

(Even better than at home!)
Everything was clean and quiet. Beds were very comfortable. Had the x box for the kids to play here and there, which was nice. Nice little patio setup with sideview of the beach!

We utilized the cabana area for a get together next to the pool, we used to grill and bbq’d. The area had a sink and restrooms with tables and chairs for our guests. Was a perfect setup outside of the condo. We rented a gold cart right down the street. Scott quickly responded when we had any questions or concerns. Kitchen has all the items needed for successful cooking. Restrooms were spacious and both had double sinks. Xbox in living room. All TVs were smart or had a Roku. Beds were comfortable. My kids enjoyed the bunk beds as the bottom was about a full and the top was a twin, setup with a desk. Had all the needs to for beach..cooler, chairs, boogie boards. All in all this was a great stay for our getaway. Would definitely stay again."

The apartment is well distributed and functional, it had everything we needed. Bedroom was clean and bed super comfortable.
Kitchen was also super clean and with everything you need to prepare something if you don’t want to dine out.

It was comfortable for our family of 6, but I would recommend more for 5 people as the pull out couch took up quite a bit of the living room. Scott was extremely responsive and also checked in regularly just to make sure we were doing good. Beautiful sunsets as well! Really enjoyed our time!"

Stayed with kids","My husband & I along with our 3 children had a great experience staying here.
The condo exceeded our expectations. It was beautiful, clean & very close to the pool. We felt right at home. Scott & Autumn even provide beach chairs, toys, & 2 boogie boards so less items you have to pack. It’s very close to multiple restaurants & convenient stores. (HardKnocks Sports Bar & Grill was our favorite.)
It’s walking distance to the beach, but since driving/parking on the beach is allowed with a beach permit we chose to do that instead. This beach is probably the nicest beach that we have been to in Texas. It was very clean and has lifeguards on duty most of the day.
We highly recommend Scott & Autumn’s condo.
Thanks so much for helping us make a lot of fun memories!!"

The kitchen was excellent, great space for cooking, and the living room is great to relax and enjoy a peaceful time. Excellent washer and dryer. It is only 10-12 minutes walk from the rental to Chistus Spohn Hospital. So if you have family or friends that are in the hospital and you plan on spending a few days visiting them. The home is a perfect place to stay.
The only two things that I would suggest to Christopher (Host) would be to update the bed frames or the beds.
The second thing would be to add a place in The bathroom to hang the towels and a place to put the toiletries. There is not enough around the sink.
Excellent house, I would stay there again."

Stayed over a week","I first thanked them for accepting me on such a short notice. Setting aside my stay at their home for the moment, I never met the nicest and friendliest couple in my lifetime and I've been around for some time. Honest and true hospitality . My bedroom and bathroom were immaculate. They also provided a parking spot in their driveway for my rental, a tiled surface table/stool for outdoor use . My stay there was not 5 stars, more like ten. I felt more at home there then at my own apartment. Incidently , along with the furnishing were a large screen tv and small refrig. my stay there was the best. I thanked them with great gratitude and told them how fortunate I was to have met them."

Stayed with kids","Maria’s place seriously deserves ten stars. First, she reached out before our stay and was very friendly and welcoming. When we arrived, we got confused as there is a similar-style building nearby with the same address number and similar looking pool area. When we reached out to Maria, she contacted us right away and made sure we got in (to the right place :)). The place itself was very clean and welcoming, with lots of space. Our kids loved the bunk beds and the pool area. We went to the pool probably 3-4 times during our two-day stay. The rental and the pool area are very kid-friendly. The beach is only a few minutes walk away. The area was very quiet. Over the course of our stay, it felt like everything was very well thought out - this place has everything you might need. There are some great restaurants within minutes away. There are countless places to stay in this area and I’m so happy I came across Maria’s listing. We would definitely stay again!"

Stayed with a pet","We went on business and the host and The location is great but I wouldn’t want to stay again due to the front door keypad having a camera on it and when the front door, which opens inside to the home can absolutely record in the home, which should not be allowed at all. There are more cameras on the WiFi than the host lists. One in the tree by the front area, one on the front door keypad , one on the front walkway and another keypad with camera on the garage door and maybe one facing the parking. If the host is so worried about security when they live locally then I wouldn’t feel safe returning. We have been visiting the island for 18 years and I’ve never seen so many cameras on one front entry way!"

The place was exceptionality clean and very comfortable. Large TV's and great décor make this condo feel like home. The master bed was heavenly to sleep in. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook and the grill right out the back door was a plus to cook our fresh seafood and steaks. The Kayak and paddle boards were a great bonus to toddle around the bay and take in the scenery. Great location close to shops, grocery, and the beach. Easy to find and entry was a breeze. Nate was very proactive and informative before arrival and was available if needed during our stay but left us alone to enjoy which is always a plus. I give this condo an A+ and would recommend to anyone wanting a peaceful getaway. Thank You Nate."

I had some reservation changes. We added my son and his dog. I paid the pet fee. But my son and his dog did not make it. I let Nate know the day of the reservation and he was so kind he refunded the pet fee immediately. This was my favorite Airbnb I have ever stayed at. I cannot recommend it enough. Everyone in town is so friendly and prices of everything from eggs, gas and restaurants are so much cheaper than back home. Thank you for making my vacation amazing."

The little office area in back can be used as a walk-in closet, the bathroom is well laid-out, and the kitchen very workable--no stove but the induction hot plate works well, and the kitchen is stocked with everything you might need, all in very good shape. Leticia is very welcoming while still giving you privacy, and responds immediately to any questions. Very friendly and warm!

Stayed a few nights",My trip was work related. It was a perfect studio type cottage. Very clean and welcoming decorations. Loved all the plants. It gave me the ability to plan my meals during the week rather than staying in a hotel and eating out every day. Very roomy as well since my son and husband were able to join me later in the week. It is a great place in a great location just blocks from the ocean for a great ocean view evening or morning ocean view walk.

She let us know that there was a storm coming in and to be prepared. She had snacks for us and the guestbook was very detailed. Overall, this was an amazing stay for my birthday. It was well worth the money and the scenery alone was immaculate. We were able to park in driveway and go directly into the guesthouse privately. It was like we were in our little serene world. Even the neighborhood Cats were friendly. We listed this as our favorite and will be returning soon!"

The place was spotless, clean, and had every appliance / necessities that one could ask for. The internet was blazing fast and completing work was a hassle free. The beds were comfortable, spacious and relaxing. The house itself is newly remodeled and looks brand new. The backyard is beautiful and you can easily spend hours outside grilling or soaking up some sun. Amanda was a great host. Anything you need, she was always a message away and responded in amazing time. All in all I wish I could review this place a 6/5. I would definitely stay here again given the opportunity."

The bed was super cozy, I passed out for a couple of hours. My boyfriend had to wake me up a few times. I didn’t want to get out of the bed 🥹. The kitchen had a full size refrigerator and microwave. They do have an electric stovetop that you can use. There are utensils, i.e forks, spoons and cookware, also plates and mugs if you want some coffee. Ms. Julia also provided some snacks on the counters. The bathroom was pretty nice. The tub was deep and roomy for those who has long legs. My boyfriend did take a bath and enjoyed it for his back. There’s a stripe gas station about a mile out and there’s a bridge where you can see the sunrise and it is amazing.
Ms. Julia does provide an instruction and guidelines, not only to the studio, but where is the nearest restaurant, stores, etc . I do recommend this place! Mahalo"

A breezeway at the other end provides a place to lay out wet suits and towels. We would definitely stay there again for another beach holiday for the two of us."

Stayed a few nights","If I could give Julia's place 10 stars, I would! Exactly as the photos, immaculately clean, bed is like heaven. I didn't do any cooking, but there's adequate supplies if you want to. I had one small need which was addressed immediately and rectified before I was back for the day. The area is quiet, easy to find, and (for me) only about a mile from my daughter's house! It was a wonderful, peaceful place to come back to after a long day. Snacks were a very nice bonus as well! And the soaking tub...pure relaxation!
They have thoughtfully places a dehumidifier in the bathroom, since the location is right on the laguna. If you would like to have a less humid environment inside, it's a good idea to empty the water out daily. It shuts off when it's full. I didn't mind at all, as it was a nice feature.
Everything about this studio emanates thought and intention. I will definitely be back!"

Stayed a few nights","What a wonderful place! We checked in and found cold sodas and water in the fridge and the biggest TV that we've ever had the pleasure to watch! The linens were wonderful and soft and the little extras were exceptional. I loved the makeup remover wipes and the spa supplies in the bath. My husband appreciated the coffee and small things like the spices and salt and pepper. Lots of things were there that we forgot to pack, so it made our stay so easy. Also, we enjoyed the snack basket that Julia left us!
The neighborhood is super quiet, on a dead end and very close to a launch if you have a boat.
We visited Mustang Island State Park (about 10 minutes or so) and it was perfect for us. There were very few people there and our dog was welcome too! Not many shells, but soft white sand and porta potties galore! They had covered picnic tables and trash cans all along the beach. The best part was, we could drive our car and park almost next to the waves!
We would recommend this sweet place to anyone who is looking for a wonderful vacay at the beach. ⛱️🐾🏖️"

He allowed us to use the pool even though we didn’t get back from our night kayak tour (glow row) until 10pm.
He wrote our name on a sign by the gated entrance so it was easy to find the house & a sweet touch!
The place was super clean and ac worked great!
Roku is available if you have your own login! We didn’t see this in the description so we packed a laptop & HDMI cable but we didn’t need it after all!

Stayed one night",The Dawg House was really reasonably priced - especially considering how close it is to the causeway and the island. Had a wonderful stay!

Stayed one night","David's place had all that we needed and more--cleanliness, comfort, and character. The location was perfect for us, midway between downtown and the beach. All things considered, his price is very reasonable. We want to visit Corpus again soon, so we'll look to book with David again!"

It was my birthday and we walked into the place decorated with balloons and a happy birthday sign. So sweet! David is a great host. Helpful and accommodating. So friendly! We’d love to come back here and stay again :)

Stayed one night","Not only was finding the location easy (considering the greeters) but, David was responsive and friendly. The Dawg House is very cozy, and perfect for a weekend getaway. The building was so rustic that it almost makes you forget you are right next to the beach. From the decorations to how perfectly the doors open, it is obvious a lot of care was put into the Dawg House. We will absolutley make sure to come back when the weather is warmer and we would be able to use the pool and firepit. Unfortunately the werent able to use the firepit or pool due to the freezing winds of nature."
