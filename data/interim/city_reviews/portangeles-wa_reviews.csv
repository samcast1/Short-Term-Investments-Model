We enjoyed relaxing in the hot tub and using the outdoor fireplace and watching the stars. This was a perfect home base for exploring the Olympic Peninsula!

Sitting in the hot tub with the snow falling, fire crackling, and your best friends next to you? A weekend you’ll never forget. I will be thinking about this cabin for the rest of days and recommending it to anyone looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Absolutely great stay!"

Every detail has been thought through, making for a very well appointed and comfortable home. We love a clean and comfortable home and this house met every expectation. We loved how cozy, warm and welcoming the house is, yet free of clutter. The wood stove and the heated bathroom floor were special amenities for a winter visit. Looking forward to a return visit sometime soon!"

Stayed with kids","Loved this cozy stay with friends and their small human - great kitchen for home-cooked meals, great toys (board and stuffed!) for the kiddo, serene atmospheres for busy adults to wind down and spend quality time together, thoughtful touches, tasteful cabin decor. All was as advertised so the following isn't a criticism but rather an FYI for those deciding to stay - the entrance to one of the bedrooms is either through the (1) bathroom or through the spare bedroom, so best suited for a group of close friends/family who are willing to share a space rather than a large group looking for privacy from each other. That said, we in particular would gladly come back!"

Stayed with kids","An exceptionally beautiful home. The attention to detail was in each and every room. Tastefully decorated with extras. The beds were very comfortable, kitchen well stocked, quality towels/linens. I cooked 3 meals each day and never lacked what was needed for meal preparation. Several cozy locations to curl up and read a book. I was there with my son and grandson. They enjoyed the games and hot tub. The park is only open Friday, Saturday & Sunday during the winter. That was our only disappointment but I should have checked that in advance. Every aspect was easy and exceeded our expectations. The loft area is perfect for kids. You can see and hear them but feels very much their own special place."

Stayed a few nights","Omgg this was the CUTEST place to stay! It was so beautiful and so quiet. There are neighbors but neither of you can see each other and the entire neighborhood is quiet. The house itself was so adorable, and the bears everywhere made us laugh. It feels so incredibly homey, and like it's your own getaway house. I am definitely taking notes on what I want my future house to have! The Jacuzzi was perfect and being surrounded by a forest was so nice. I've been to a few airbnbs but this one is definitely my favorite hands down. PA is only a ten-ish drive away but you're still secluded enough to feel immense privacy. Absolutely stunning house and surroundings. We will definitely be back and definitely for a longer stay."

Stayed with kids","This was our second year taking our family here for a mid-winter escape and we’re already planning our trip next year! The cabin feels like the owners actually stay here, not that they’re just throwing a place together for a quick buck.
Favorite parts, by family member
7yo: board games!
2yo: cedar hot tub and no bedtime
Dad: cedar hot tub, wood stove, comfy bed and pillows (and he’s picky!). All the bears!
Mom: lots of open space to hang out, wood stove, heated bathroom floors (!!)."

Stayed with kids","Beautiful, clean, and well appointed cabin on an awesome property in a fantastic location - what more could you want?! We were seriously impressed by both the interior of the cabin and the property itself, everything was actually BETTER in real life than in the pictures (which is rare!). The outdoor area is so picturesque and has a lovely hot tub, fire pit, sitting areas, and trails directly off the property. We also loved that the main bedroom actually has a large king size bed and was super cozy. You’re also minutes from an entrance to the Olympics, I seriously don’t think you could get much closer without camping. Overall, highly recommend!"

Perfectly appointed with every amenity you could ever think of, and a few you may not realize you need til you’re there. We were looking to turn off our phones and recharge our batteries following an intensely busy stretch of life… this was the perfect spot. Super comfortable beds, beautiful cedar hot tub, walking distance to many hiking trails, and modern conveniences throughout the cabin. WiFi and TV didn’t work well, but a blessing in disguise to be honest as we were able to concentrate on relaxing. Highly recc’d!"

Stayed a few nights","Privately tucked amongst cedar trees, this house is so thoughtfully designed (inside and out) that we are hoping to come back next summer. Our intention for the weekend was to rest and be together (it was a romantic getaway for us) and we could not have been more satisfied with EVERYTHING! I am a realtor on Whidbey Island. I see a lot of vacation rentals. The care and love that went into this place is palpable. We loved that we felt ""so far away"" yet were still close enough to Pt. Angeles that we had access to great dining. The house exceeded our expectations. If you are looking for a quiet retreat surrounded by beauty, this is it! Already looking forward to a summertime visit!"

The property feels really private even though is just a few minutes drive from Port Angeles, and just around the corner from the Hurricane Ridge Park entrance. We really enjoyed lying on the wooden loungers looking up at the trees and watching the birds, and relaxing in the hot tub after hiking. The house is really cosy (specially the bedrooms) which made it difficult to leave for hikes in the morning!.
Overall we had a great stay and wished we could have stayed longer."

We’ve stayed at quite a few cabins over the last few years and this was one of the top ones. Everything worked, was laid out nicely, very clean, private, etc. I actually left something behind and the host was so kind as to offer to send it back to me. We plan to stay here again in the future for sure. We just loved it. So random but their DVD collection was 10/10 lol."

This cabin was the perfect basecamp for our adventures, and we loved coming home each day to this peaceful and beautiful cabin and property. We loved the outdoor area for star gazing and soaking in the cedar hot tub. The house itself was so cozy, homey, and clean. We would love to come again!!"

The rain shower felt AMAZING after a day of hiking. The bed in the main bedroom was literal heaven. Our kids loved the bed in the loft, the checkers and the cool Jenga blocks!"

The best part of the house is the outdoor space! There is a lovely soaking tub, a fire pit (owners provided wood! they also left some makings for s'mores, but I'd recommend bringing your own) and hammocks in the trees for extra peaceful afternoons.

There’s much more space in the cabin than I anticipated, the loft basically serves as a third bedroom, which our kids LOVED.
The property itself is obviously well cared for, from all of the details inside to the outside set up, it’s apparent that so much care is put into the cabin. Without a doubt, we’ll be staying here in the future."

Stayed one night","We loved our stay here! So cozy. Had a quick one-nighter after a day of hiking in the park. This house is 3 minutes from the Lake Angeles trailhead and about 15 minutes from Port Angeles, making it the perfect spot for hikers. The hot tub and shower inside are both amazing after a long hike. The host generously let us in before check-in time so we could change into dry clothes before getting lunch. Much more space to sleep than we initially thought – plenty of space for three guys."

Stayed a few nights","Amazing private, quite place, in the middle of fairytale forest with deer families passing by. If you are looking for the perfect relaxation getaway - I highly recommend it. The cedar barrel outside, with spectacular view on the forest is something that will certainly change your entire perspective of how hot tube should look/feel like. I do not think I will enjoy chilling in other type of hot tube from this very moment.
Should emphasize the all small touching details in the house - you can definitely say that the person who owns it truly love this place from the bottom of the heat.
I can’t imagine more calm place that will bring you to the Christmas mood even then it is still one month ahead."

The cabin smelled amazing and the decor made it that much more cozier. We had everything we needed to make dinner our first night, we enjoyed the hot tub in the middle of the forest and under the stars, and we slept so well that it was difficult to get up for our drive to our hikes in the morning. 5/5 stars for everything and we can’t wait to bring our friends and family here in the future!"

House is decorated very nicely and the outdoor space is a great place to relax after hiking…The hot tub was much appreciated. Lake Dawn is across the street so not actually viewable from backyard…but there is a hiking trail that may lead to a vista where you have a view?..we didn’t make it up that far. Wifi was a bit spotty so recommend making all important calls and communication prior to returning for the evening.

The hot tub was a wonderful place for my husband and I to relax and unwind after hiking and exploring the beauty of Olympic National Park and the surrounding areas. The cabin is perfectly located near one of the visitor's centers and is not far from downtown Port Angeles. There are trails on the property itself as well as just down the road to explore.

Someone walked carefully through the every day life of a vacationer and anticipated his/her every need. The cabin was clean and comfortable and decorated perfectly. We long to return for a soak in the hot tub and to sit around the fire pit. Thank you for opening your cabin so that we could experience the magic of the forest in simple yet luxurious style."

Stayed with kids","We took this trip for my daughter’s 16th birthday so it was all focused on her. My 8yo son was very gracious about doing everything she wanted to do and only wanted this hot tub. We specifically booked this place cause he asked for a hot tub, and it was much more expensive than we would have liked. Needless to say the hot tub did not work. When I messaged them, thinking I didn’t know how to get it to work, Instead of sending instructions or saying “hmm that’s odd, try this or that and if not I’ll get someone out there,” they immediately responded saying it was too late to send someone. I responded saying “hey just tell me how to do it I dont know if somethings wrong…..” They were then completely unresponsive the rest of that evening and through the next morning, even to the Airbnb people who tried to contact them. Because of the amount of $ we spent that we wouldn’t have without wanting the hot tub, everything was very disappointing. Though the property/house was beautiful, I would steer clear because if you have any issues you may not get a response."

Stayed with kids","This was really a great cabin in the woods. We used it as of jumping off point to go up to Hurricane Ridge (completely amazing) and explore the Olympic National Park. We also loved exploring the trail right from the property. Didn’t see a soul!
We also took the Little river road right from Lake Dawn Road as a cut through down to Madison Falls - worked out perfectly (kind of looks sketchy on the map but in the summer it’s totally easy).
Kids loved hanging around on the hammocks & the loft was a total hit. We had a little deer come visit too. The house was so clean, cute and well stocked. Exactly what we were looking for! The property management team was super easy to work with and very responsive. A+!"

It didn't feel like too long of a drive up and down the road to get to town, but it was remote enough that we felt like we were in a cabin in the woods. We found Port Angeles itself to be lovely as well.
We loved that the host was so thoughtful about the items in the house. Little things like games, firestarter, matches, roasting sticks, cooking oil, salt, pepper, coffee, tea, and soap were there for us even though these are things we normally always try to remember to pack because you never know what will be available, but this host was thoughtful enough to have them available in case we forgot our own. We had everything we needed for cooking, everything we needed for a stress-free stay.
We would love to come back someday."

added touches include s’mores kits, espresso coffee and an amazing time!

Everything about the cabin itself was so well-considered and hospitable. You can tell that it is well-cared for. Our family (2 grownups, 2 kids, and a newly walking toddler), was completely comfortable. Great amenities for indoor and outdoor cooking, lots of games and toys, etc. Nicely updated bathroom and laundry with every detail provided for.

Stayed a few nights","We had a great time at Sol Duc Serenity! It is not only beautiful, but in a great location for exploring Olympic National Park! We greatly enjoyed the hot tub and relaxing in front of the fireplace after a long day of hiking. The bed is super comfortable! On our last day, six eagles were hanging out around the river. It was so peaceful! Also, I didn’t realize it until days after we left, but I left a banana bread I made in the oven! I’m so sorry for the cleaner if he/she had to find/clean it or the next guest! We really enjoyed our stay! Thank you!"

Stayed a few nights","We spent 2 nights here and were blown away by the location right on the river. It was so beautiful it was hard to leave each day to go hiking! We loved the large windows and the well stocked kitchen (we bought groceries from Forks and cooked meals in the house), and the deck overlooking the river. We saw bald eagles fly by!
This place was a good location for us to explore the Hoh Rainforest and some western and northern beaches on the peninsula.
The only issue we had was that the warm water from both sinks only lasted a minute or so before becoming freezing cold (fortunately this didn’t happen in the shower).
Overall it was an amazing stay and I’m so happy availability opened up for my trip! You will not regret booking this place!"

Centrally located to see everything we wanted to see. We stayed five nights, and spent one of the days just enjoying the place and spending a lot of time in the hot tub feeling completely immersed in the forest. Cannot wait to return. Believe the hype in the reviews, it was perfect for us."

The cool evenings are perfect for the hot tub which is private and also overlooks the river. The highlights of our stay were morning coffees, sitting by the fire in the living room and reading, having a dip in the hot tub, watching movies in the evening and listening to the rain. We hope that Sol Duc Serenity will be available for years to come so that we can return to celebrate our anniversaries."

Stayed a few nights","The easiest 5-star review we have ever written!
My wife and I just got married & spent the first part of our Honeymoon here! Amber’s gem in the PNW could not have been a more perfect experience & exceeded any and all expectations we had during our stay.
The location was prime, and was right in the middle of all the major attractions we were hoping to see in the ONP. During our four day stay, we were able to visit Mount Storm King, Marymere Falls, Hoh Rainforest, Cape Flattery, Ruby Beach & much more! And the view from the place? With breathtaking scenery and peaceful sounds from the Sol Duc River, the photos do not do its justice. After a long day of hiking, the hot tub and fireplace were magical.
Amber’s attention to detail is hard to miss, from the beautiful coffee mugs to the selection of books available, to the series of twilight movies at hand. She’s incredible! If you are looking for the perfect PNW getaway experience, look no further! We will be back again ❤️"

Since we were here during the winter, we mostly just lounged about, played games and read. The cabin makes a great base camp for explorations in the national park and surrounding areas."

The space is small but very well decorated with a full kitchen that has everything you'll need to make nice meals. And you will want to bring food because restaurants are about 25 minutes away. The closest easy hike is about 5 minutes down the road with otherwise hikes 10 minutes away. We loved our visit and hope to return again."

Stayed a few nights","The quintessential Pacific NW cabin experience! Gorgeous setting among moss-draped trees along the banks of the Sol Duc River. The sound of the river rushing by was peaceful and relaxing. The cabin was well-stocked with everything you need, including cozy blankets, local guide books and board games. Loved the Northwest-themed decor throughout. Being able to enjoy the river right from the hot tub was wonderful. While the river drowns out the road traffic noise on the river side of the house, the noise is somewhat audible in the bedroom, though not a major issue unless you are a very light sleeper. Amber was extremely responsive and friendly, even allowing us an early check-in. We'll be back!"

Stayed a few nights","Little slice of paradise in the PNW! Where to start with this gem…my friend and I were just there during this deep freeze in Jan, and it was the coziest , warmest , most peaceful place we have stayed in awhile. The bed was extremely comfortable, pillow top soft , all the fixtures and amenities were new and modern. You can tell Amber takes care of the property and pride in hosting. The cake topper is the hot tub , right next to the lovely flowing river , moss covered trees surrounding you, a gorgeous sunset down river … and then once the sunsets you have the most glorious view of the night sky . It really is magical.
As for location , it is easy to access from the main road, no need to worry about needing to have 4wheel drive . It is a perfect location to explore the upper part of the peninsula, from hiking shi-shi beach trail, to cape flattery , or to the east to spend time in Port Angeles or exploring Lake Crescent , it gives you a great jumping off point for flexible exploring !"

We also enjoyed the location because we felt away from it all, but didn’t mind taking a drive to the many things to do and see in the national park. We were able to see beaches, go hiking, and our favorite was exploring the Hoh rainforest. We would love to stay here again in the future!"

Stayed a few nights","This place was by far the best we have ever stayed at. The pictures do not do it justice! It was so peaceful, magical and cozy - everything I wanted for a getaway to relax and check out. My only regret is not booking it for the whole week! It was within an hour of the majority of things we wanted to do and see in Olympic National park and perfect location between forks (for all the twilight fans) and port Angeles. The hot tub and fire place were amazing and made us feel like we were finally on vacation. WiFi is iffy but Amber warned us of that and we wanted a break from day to day life anyways so it actually helped us not be all up in our phones, but for those who don’t have the same plan as us, just keep that in mind. We had one tiny hiccup with the washing machine and Amber was extremely responsive and helpful! It was clean, beautifully decorated and matched the description. This is now our favorite place to stay in the PNW and I can’t wait to be back."

Stayed a few nights","One of the best Airbnb’s we’ve stayed in! I don’t think you’ll find a better place location-wise in the park. If you want to visit the coast, the rainforest, the lake, or Port Angeles, this place is right in the middle of it all - which is important because it’s a huge park that requires a bit of driving to see everything.
The house is exactly as you see it in pictures. A quaint getaway with a wonderful fireplace that warms the main room to the coziest degree. The porch opens to the Sol Duc, a blue river in the midst of mossy green trees and the relaxing sound of moving water right outside your door. We took full advantage of the upgraded hot tub and cooked hot dogs over the fire.
There aren’t a ton of food options on the peninsula, but luckily Amber has the house stocked with everything needed to make a meal, including a variety of spices. We picked up provisions in Forks and cooked salmon and steak each night!
Amber even came out within 30 min to help with the fireplace."

Back porch sticks out over the river bank and the white water river puts off peaceful music for relaxation! The hot tub on the bank is a perfect place to relax coupled with the fire pit in the front. Neighbors were around working chopping wood etc but no noise or hassle what so ever. It’s not a go out on the town place it’s a get away and relax place and that’s exactly why we were there !!! Kitchen was well equipped for cooking and the fire place was an added enjoyment. All in all a great place and easy host! Don’t leave without seeing the Hoh rain forest and taking a trip out to the beach!

Warning: you’ll never want to leave the deck once you park yourself there to listen to the running river with a cup of coffee or glass of wine.

The location is central to a lot of landmarks that we were interested in exploring. We stayed 3 nights and we were able to visit Kalaloch Beach, Ruby Beach, Rialto Beach, Lake Crescent, Hall of Mosses, Forks and Cape Flattery. The longest drive was a little over an hour.
The cabin was exactly as described. Tucked away from the highway and overlooking the river. I was able to make my way down to the river for some amazing sunset pictures. We had no complaints! Bed was comfy, living room and kitchen have everything you need (no microwave, but we didn't need it).
Finally, let's talk about the hot tub! Sometimes we come across these magical settings that we want to experience for our self....this is it! The hot tub is as close to the river as it can get. We enjoyed every minute looking at the scenery and listening to the sounds of the river. We will be back!"

Stayed a few nights","We had an amazing time and loved that the cabin was literally right in the middle of everything that we wanted to do. Olympic National Park is huge and everything will still quite a drive away, but we were right in the middle between the coast's hiking trails, Cape Flattery and Hurricane Ridge. Had we stayed in Port Angeles or Forks everything would have been much more of a drive each direction. The cabin was secluded and private, everything was clean and we felt very safe. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a quiet retreat."

Stayed a few nights","Along the Sol Duc River, the cabin is orientated towards the river and forest. Though the access road is close by, the river’s current muffle most noise of the little traffic one might hear. New hot tub was clean and allowed muscles to warm up after days of hiking. Centered between Crescent Lake and Forks, it was convenient if one is found going north, or south."

The cabin is in perfect proximity to the river for a gorgeous view and relaxing white noise. Our stay was truly therapeutic! The location was perfect for us to easily drive to Hoh Rainforest, Forks, La Push, Lake Crescent, Sol Duc Falls and the most beautiful of my life at Cape Flattery. We were able to make simple meals for ourselves in the kitchen between hikes and drives which was a real time saver for us. The hot tub was a wonderful way to relax tired muscles at the end of the day. We would love to return again someday in the future! I’ll be thinking about this trip for a long long time!"

The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom is very spacious. Amber is highly responsive and sent clear pre- check in and pre-check out instructions. We highly recommend this cabin and if we ever come back to the area we would 100% book here again. Thank you Amber, for helping make our honeymoon relaxing and stress free!"

The home, the views, everything about it. Amber was very friendly and super informative on everything. Her home has little notes to remind you how to work certain things which I think is super helpful. I unfortunately had to cut my trip short but would stay there 10x over. Port Angeles isn’t too far (45 mins) and the drive is beautiful everywhere you go. This place is a little slice of heaven. I hope to stay here again in the future!"

The place was very comfortable and really felt like home for the time we were there, so much so that it was quite sad to have to leave and go back to our actual home.
Couldn’t have asked for a better place to celebrate an anniversary and to escape the fast paced world for a few days. Definitely will want to try and make this a tradition for us moving forward."

Amber has created a gorgeous modern retreat on the river and has provided perfect amenities, from a riverside hot tub and gorgeous open deck, to an updated Kitchen, cozy living room (all with incredible views of the river), a fabulous and updated large and clean bathroom, and a charming bedroom with a super comfy bed.
I'm so happy I treated myself to time at this unforgettable place! The rushing river and lush surroundings captivated my attention and fed my love for nature. Truly incredible!
After reading other reviews with guests lamenting having to leave the airbnb for other activities they'd planned, I knew I needed no further excursions- this amazing location is one of a kind and you won't want to leave!"

Tucked in the woods yet fully accessible, it has been beautifully crafted and accessorized with everything you need for the perfect romantic and coziest weekend. My only regret was not booking more nights here as we did not want to leave. Amber is extremely thorough as well. There are instructions for everything, everywhere! In addition she provides recommendations for things to do nearby, and includes an assortment of games and movies for any downtime in the cabin. Truly one of the best host and I highly recommend staying here. I was on the fence when I first stumbled upon this place as I thought it was too good to be true, but I read someone else’s review who said book it you won’t regret it. Well I echo those thoughts. Book this place if you want to spend your weekend in paradise.
P.S. The hot tub and firepit are a plus!"

Cozy and beautiful. Also very quiet and extremely clean. I’d say it’s better for a couple—or an individual—than a group because it’s small. That said, if you stay in the summer, then there’s a large patio and a huge lot, so space isn’t so much of an issue.
Anyway, we highly recommend Amber’s place!"

It wasn’t easy to drive around the surrounding area for a day due to the weather, but with some groceries and supplies brought with us, the fire place and hot tub (the hot tub is exquisite!) made that no problem. For being a bit snowed in, loved having a few games & movies at the Air bnb already to pass the time. The location with the river along the backside of the cabin is spectacular, and having seen it in the snow, I’d love to be back one day in the spring/summer season.

Stayed a few nights",The home had an ambiance with the river off the back patio and patio lights for evening conversations. We enjoyed the hottub although it was a tight fit for adults. It was quite a hot weekend for the PNW in the mid 80's and one of the screens in the kitchen wasn't installed so it took a while for the house to cool down without a cross wind or portable fans to pull in cool air. When we opened the windows there was lots of traffic noise from the road in the bedroom. Lots of towels and sheets were available but we couldn't seem to find any kleenex around the home. We enjoyed the keurig for morning coffee but would have loved access to the wifi to update our families on our trip! Overall an enjoyable stay in this quaint cabin.

The location is great for so many good hikes like the Sol Duc Falls area and Storm King. It was very clean and thoughtfully and beautifully designed with quality details such as good knives and stocked kitchen, good shampoo and conditioner, and washer/dryer. The bed was very comfortable, the instructions and communication about everything were great. The deck and river were AMAZING. I would love love love to come back."

Stayed one night","Two large picture windows frame a magnificent view of the Sol Duc river. The sound of the water provides a soothing background. The large deck became our favorite spot for morning coffee and evening meal. We marveled at the wildlife. Inside Amber has fully outfitted her cozy space. The recently added (very comfy) Adirondack chairs and Solo fire pit out back add another gathering place. The location is an easy drive to the Olympic National Park where we hiked and fished. My husband also fished in front of the cabin. It was too early in the season to get much fish action (water too high and fast) but who cares when the scenery is so breathtaking. When an unpredictable, natural event required us to vacate the cabin, Amber was responsive and helpful. She is, indeed, a Super Host. A very lovely spot."

Stayed a few nights","Beautiful location, cute cottage, clean and well supplied. Although the weather didn't permit use of the deck, it's a lovely secluded spot overlooking the river with the sound of rushing water. Communication with the owner was good and she was responsive to a couple of issues we had. There IS a wireless network if you ask--otherwise you have to walk a bit down the road to communicate, which would be inconvenient if you need the owner's attention for an immediate problem. As in the property description, it's a drive to any shopping or restaurants, so prepare to be self-sufficient with food. But the location is fairly central to some of ONP's major destinations. Perfect couples' getaway!"

It was an easy drive to so many beautiful locations and we loved coming back to such a cozy place with an amazing view. One of our favorite parts was spotting three different eagles hanging around over the river and watching them for hours while we were in the hot tub before they flew off around dusk.
Amber was also really helpful with any questions we had and did a wonderful job of giving directions to everything you need to know about the house in a thoughtful binder you will find when you arrive.
We hope to come stay here again in the future!"

The setting is gorgeous, the huge windows are a dream, the hot tub on the river is incredible, but on top of all of that, the home is so thoughtfully decorated and furnished, and so clean. Very comfy and warm bed, great shower, cozy living area and a fully stocked kitchen so we could cook meals. We were truly blown away. Watching the bald eagles catch fish from the hot tub was the highlight of our trip. The central location made exploring ONP so easy. And because the house is *right* on the river, you don’t even realize you are just off the main road. Like others have mentioned, we did not have cell service, but it wasn’t really an issue, we just looked up anything we needed when we had service down the road. We cannot wait to come stay here again!"

Stayed one night","Wow, this place is AMAZING!! So incredibly stocked with everything you may need for any stay, long or short. The entire place was so cozy, the bed was very comfy, and the location was perfect. We saw deer both days, experienced lovely weather and enjoyed the local restaurants and shops. Our only critique is that we found the wifi to be slow and unreliable, we wouldn’t recommend for remote work, but this didn’t impact our stay at all as our phone service worked just fine (Verizon). The hosts were very responsive and provided fantastic information and recommendations. We would gladly rebook a stay here 10/10, five stars!! Thanks so much!"

Stayed one night","If you're looking for a place in Port Angeles, look no further. Shellay & Michaels quaint little cabin was one of the best AirBnBs we've ever stayed in. The bed was 5-star, the turkish robes and bath towels were what dreams are made of, and we woke up to a herd of deer out our window. The hosts thought about every little detail, and it showed. The cabin was well-equipped with everything you might need (there is even a fan in the closet for those who need the noise for sleep), there was a lovely coffee and tea selection, and the tackle box full of smores ingredients was a wonderful touch (it was snowing, so we didn't take advantage of the fire pit, but we might have snuck a Hershey's bar or two.) There was a ""junk drawer"" full of handy odds and ends, and the bathroom was stocked full with the little things that help make an overnight stay successful. Check this place out; I promise, you will NOT be disappointed!"

Our two day stay your cabin was a heartwarming experience. Every detail was thoroughly arranged creating a space that felt like an extension of our own home. The christmas decor added a special touch of joy. We are inspired to take many of these decor ideas back with us.
The true highlight for us was our conversation with you, Shellay! Sharing stories from our lives and hearing about your journey was incredibly moving. Next time, we are excited to cook a traditional indian meal for you and enjoy it together.
Thank you for such a memorable stay!"

Shellay and Michael have created a wonderful experience for anyone lucky enough to book a stay here. This was the first time I have ever stayed in an AirBnB and have it feel as comfortable as my own home.
The personal touches in this AirBnB blew my partner and I away. Shellay and Michael have anticipated every need that guests might have, including (adorably) a s'mores kit complete with several kinds of chocolate, marshmallows, and graham crackers for guests who choose to use the outdoor fire pit.
We were sad to leave after only one night at this AirBnB. Next time we visit the Olympic Peninsula, we will definitely try to book the space again, and for a longer stay. Highly recommend!"

It's an easy jumping off point to the ferry to Victoria or the Port Angeles side of Olympic National Park.

The amenities in the bathroom were incredible: from robes to tooth brushes, shaving cream, and more…it’s all there. The kitchen is so well stocked for its size. Our favorite was the s’more kit! Coffee and tea was plentiful and there were amazing breakfast basics like pancake mix and condiments in the fridge.
The provided beach toys and an entire beach kit complete with sunscreen for kids as well as ample literature and the cutest porch reading spot.
The king bed was so so cozy…soft and comfortable. Be mindful that the futon is fairly small and would be great for two small children but not much bigger than that.
We loved being on the outside of Port Angeles and tucked away from the hustle and bustle of town. Don’t miss the Freshwater Bay park down the road to view the sunset!"

Stayed a few nights","I recently had the pleasure of staying at Shellay & Michael's charming cabin in Port Angeles, and I couldn't have asked for a better experience. From the moment we arrived, we were enchanted by the warm and inviting atmosphere. The cabin served as an ideal retreat after our exhilarating hikes in the Olympic National Park. Its cozy interior provided the perfect setting to unwind and recharge.
We appreciated the cleanliness of the cabin, which added to the overall comfort of our stay. The thoughtful and tasteful decorations throughout the cabin added to its charm. We felt right at home and appreciated the personal touch that the host put into creating such an inviting space.
One of the standout aspects of the cabin was its convenient location. It was just the right distance from downtown Port Angeles, allowing us to easily explore the town's attractions and sample its local cuisine. I cannot recommend Shellay & Michael's cabin highly enough."

Stayed a few nights","We had the pleasure of staying at Shellay and Michael’s charming cottage for two nights in mid-June. As other guests have noted, the spotless cottage is equipped with virtually anything you’d want for a vacay stay, from barbecue tools to bathrobes. The bed is super comfy and the location in a grove of towering cedars is very peaceful. Shellay even dropped by at our invitation to share great local hiking and dining suggestions. If you do decide to go into town to buy groceries or grab a bite, it’s a 15-minute drive."

The interior was immaculate, just as pictured. The appliances were again new and modern. Everything we needed for meals was within reach. The furniture was new, comfy the bed and linens were luxurious. The bathroom was off the charts and saving the ideas for our next bath makeover. Again, sleek modern surfaces, robes, thick, fluffy towels. My favorite was the skylight overhead. I felt like I was showering among the cedars. The original artwork was beautiful and added that special touch to the cabin. One of the special treats was being able to watch deer feed out among the cedars from the back window or quietly from the porch! Again a wonderful relaxing retreat after a long flight."

They were thrilled about all the board games, beach toys, outdoor space to run around, and complimentary s’mores kit and hot chocolate!!!! Check-in and communication were a breeze. The place is less than five minutes from a great beach, which was beautiful to explore even in cooler weather. Proximity to Olympia National Park is a huge bonus, such a majestic area!!! It is slightly outside of town, so about 15 minutes away from stores/restaurants. The surrounding area is very quiet and peaceful…we saw dear and bald eagles close by!!! Every aspect of the cottage was thought out to provide visitors with all they need to enjoy the stay…..sand toys, fire pit with logs ready to go, supply of coffee/tea, bath products, bathrobes, and both beds are extremely comfortable!!"

Place was very clean and had everything we needed for a relaxing and rejuvenating weekend. Primary bed was very comfortable.
Close to town, we were able to walk and grab dinner! It’s right off the main drag, so there was road noise at rush hour, but nothing that got in the way of us relaxing/ sleeping well.
Thanks again Jeff, we’ll be back!"

Stayed a few nights","Knowing that weather can be iffy in March, we wanted a place that would be enjoyable rain or shine. Jeff's place definitely delivered! Gorgeous waterfront views from all 3 levels, room to spread out, and walkable to restaurants, shops, the waterfront, etc.
Jeff was great with communication. All the instructions & directions were clear, and we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay.
We loved this place, but it is a little quirky and slightly dated. The ground floor bedroom is private, but the master bedroom is open to the main living area (with a partition that we didn't use) and the loft (with a futon, desk, etc.) is also open. This worked for our family with two teens, but may not work if you require more privacy."

Ground level had small bedroom, full bath and laundry; 2nd level had kitchen, dining, living room and primary bedroom and full bath —very open floor plan; there was a third level with office space and a futon etc to lounge. Easy for our group to spread out and views on all levels. Being able to easily walk to restaurants and shops and the ferry was a real plus. Would definitely stay again."

Notable: As a listing that allows pets. House was meticulous (did not smell or show any indications of dogs) Yard was clean, 100% free of pet waste. Greatly appreciated that I didn’t have to clean up after former pet guests. Arrived and was able to immediately get my dog out for a walk to decompress after traveling. Thank you!

I think it was the cleanest Air BNB I've ever stayed in. Location was very convenient to Dungeness, Port A, Salt Creek and Olympic allowing us to limit car time and maximize adventure time.

With the Olympic mountains as your view with sweet cows roaming freely in the pasture next to it, there isn’t anywhere else you’d rather be when the sun sets. The house was spotless with that cozy old time feel. We played cds from their awesome collection with the windows open, letting in the ocean breeze while we danced and cooked dinner together has a family. It elevated our trip to the peninsula ten fold.
This sweet farm was a place we didn’t want to leave and in hindsight, wished we had stayed at for our entire trip. We will stay here again the future!

and history displayed throughout the space created a warm and welcoming atmosphere. The hosts' attention to detail was evident in every corner of the house from the linens to the decorations. Waking up to the sight of cows grazing in the field with the mountains in the distance is a memory we’ll never forget, and our stay was a wonderful escape from the city. Highly recommend for a relaxing getaway!"

Such a perfect location for its glorious view of the mountains and immediate comfortable, rural surroundings, with such easy proximity to so many great places on the water, or in the mountains and forest, and with both Port Angeles and Sequim in easy reach for restaurants, shops and more. In addition, Finn Hall Farm is doggy heaven. Our dog, Peaches, requested I mention that.

Stayed a few nights","I chose this Airbnb looking for a peaceful place to spend the 4th of July with my elderly dog who is terrified of the fireworks in my neighborhood and it was perfect! The house was so clean and was much more spacious than I expected. Even though it’s dog friendly there is no doggie smell in the home. My old man loved exploring the area around the house, there are lots of herbs in the landscaping and there was even a nest of baby birds in one of the birdhouses, I enjoyed listening to the babies when the parents would come and go.
The house had everything we needed for a lovely stay, including a big dog blanket for my pup to snooze on in front of the couch. I already booked our stay for next year."

Stayed one night","Suzie’s farm was a wonderful home away from home. The place had everything we needed and more. Good music is available and made the ambiance of the little farmhouse that much better. We stayed the night of a windstorm, power goes out momentarily, but candles and lamps are around if needed. Beds are comfortable and clean and we slept very good even with the roaring winds outside. Suzie was also a fantastic and communicative host. Definitely would recommend a night or two here if you’re in the area."

Stayed with kids","This house was in such a peaceful location—quiet, dark at night, and lots of open expanse. Great location for sites near Sequim and Port Angeles. The house is very tastefully decorated and the owners thought of everything you might need. We enjoyed the s’mores supplies left for us, as well as grilling outside (briquettes were on site). There were raspberries and currants ripe for picking when we were there and fun things for our 8-year old to explore. As a city family, it was a welcome chance to simply slow down. The CD collection was novel for our son and kept him entertained for hours! My husband even enjoyed a massage from Suzie while at the house, which was an unexpected bonus, since Suzie is a massage professional and has a cute studio on site. Highly recommend Hurricane Ridge at sunrise, Dungeness National Wildlife Refuge any time, and the Dungeness Valley Creamery to see the cows and try ice cream and raw milk. Berry picking at Graymarsh Farm was also a treat. Thank you for a memorable stay."

Stayed with a pet","DO NOT STAY WITH THIS HOST! My 1st bad Airbnb review. Facts: I gave her 2hr notice when I would arrive. She did not heat the RV for me. I had to search for 1 tiny space heater. Upon arrival, it was 50deg in the RV. She told me that it would warm up with both heaters on high. It never got warmer than 53 deg, and the water ran dry due to frozen pipes. I used my own water that I brought, in order to use the toilet properly (you have to fill it with water before using, or it will be very dirty.) I brought lots of warm clothing. I got very little sleep. I left the place spotless as I always do. There was never any hot water, even after the place warmed up with the sun the next day. No shower. Not enough TP provided. I left early and asked for a refund, which she agreed to. Both host and Airbnb get an F, since I had to beg for a refund, which I have not seen, 2 wks later. I am told I may get 30%. Unbelievable. Airbnb can't be trusted to advocate for guests. This host should be removed."

Lindsey was a rock star host! Gave great recommendations -Ediz Hook, the coolest black sand beach is a must. I felt bad having the place to myself - so much room- but I got over it.
Bed was too good, almost stayed in it. Very quiet and private area. Wish I would have made time to enjoy outdoor space. Loved the lights. Kitchen rocked. Bathroom was more than expected! Even washed a small load of clothes!!

She even went the extra mile and provided a care package for my dog! Only a few minor issues which is why I didn’t give it 5 stars, but not the end of the world by any means. The TV sound and remote was difficult to work and malfunctioning, and the oven didn’t work. I brought this to Lindsey’s attention and she is looking into it so I imagine it won’t be an issue for anyone else staying there! Overall, I would absolutely stay here again!"

I appreciated being able to have some tea the evening I stayed there (nice options to choose from!). Though I only met Anita through a friendly smile and wave when I arrived, she was quick to respond with information regarding my stay. Checking in and out was quick and easy. I will definitely look to stay here again next time I am in the area."

The rental has plenty of books, magazines, and papers explaining information about the Port Angeles and the surrounding areas to help you plan anything you want to do! It is super well decorated and is a very relaxing place to stay. You can see the ocean from the room and it’s located in a neighborhood that feels secluded enough for a great time yet is close enough to Port Angeles for anything you will need! It was overall a great time and worth it!"

Anita could not have been more responsive, kind or accommodating. She genuinely desires that her guests have a terrific time in Port Angeles. We had a hike of a life time on the Obstruction Point trail off of Deer Park Road. If you can handle a 7.5 mi hike (about 1/2 of the trail's length) where 1/2 of it is pretty much straight up (and 8 mi drive on a winding dirt road) you must take this hike! The view of the Olympic Mountains was breathtaking. Very pleased that we booked with Anita."

It's a little farther away from the beaten path. But the tradeoff is that the neighborhood is in very beautiful, very lush surroundings. Peaceful and pristine.
In my experience, the suite is twice the size of the average Airbnb. With a king-size bed, a pull-out bed and a decent sized couch, it can comfortably accommodate four people."

Bottom line though, of course, was there was such a warm welcoming atmosphere you could ease up from that sensation. Magnificent View! We weren't there more than maybe 5 minutes, one of the blinds concerned us that we might break it due to how heavy it was to lower. Anita showed up at the door Immediately in response to my text of concern, and showed us it was no problem! You'll never find another vacation place to stay any better in every way than Eagle's Rest"

The view from the place was beautiful and the indoors were cozy, and it was close enough to all the places we wanted to see in Olympic national Park. Thank you, Anita!"

Stayed a few nights","This spot was perfect for our needs with visiting Olympic National Park and the west coast. It’s such a quiet neighborhood, with beautiful views, and easy access to Port Angeles. The suite was so clean and cozy, and after long days of hiking, it was nice to come back to wash up, relax with the fireplace going, and have a cup of tea. Our hosts were so thoughtful and got me a card and a bottle of wine for my birthday, which was so unexpected but so very much appreciated. We loved our stay at Eagles Rest, and can’t wait to come back!"

Stayed one night","Perfect stay for a trip to Olympic National Park.
I live in Seattle and needed somewhere to stay to break up my drive home after visiting Olympic National Park. I also wanted an AirBNB that would be unproblematic due to trying to also secretly plan my proposal.
This stay was everything I needed and beyond for a similar price as the Olympic Inn where I stayed the last time I travelled to Olympic NP. However, this stay was significantly better quality.
(1) The king sized bed is very comfortable; (2) the bathroom was spotless and I love that we had a washer and dryer available; (3) the room itself is spacious, well planned with the sleeping areas, kitchenette, and living area placed in pleasing setting with a wonderful view of the water; (4) The hosts are friendly, thoughtful, and communicative. I did not experience any issues, but I did let them know about my proposal and they ensured our experience was perfect!
There isn’t any more debate left to be had. If you’ve come to this review just go ahead and book it. My only regret was not booking for two nights."

Spent most of our time at the national park which is very close by. The view from the stay is breathtaking at sunset! We could not be happier with our experience here."

Easy access to Sequim, Port Angeles, Hurricane Ridge, and Lake Crescent. Our daughter slept on the rollaway bed and said it was very comfortable. There was plenty of room for us to spread out and feel like we had our own space. Great value!"

Since Anita and Brent live above the studio, they are easy to get in touch with and have tons of recommendations for the area. With that, they respected our space and privacy. I've never had such accommodating hosts with airbnb, and highly recommend staying here!"

Was not disappointed either! Exactly as advertised which was beautiful decorated and comfortable studio with an awesome bathroom shower and bathrobes. Had all the kitchen stuff we needed and then some. Met husband of the host very briefly. He was very pleasant and encouraged us to ask for anything we needed. However we did not need anything else. Would stay there again. Was only a few minutes from Port Angeles, however was quieter almost country setting w/ nice view and cozy fireplace. If your have some doubt try it out. You won't be disappointed."

Stayed a few nights","The stay was just a bit out of town, and it was fairly easy to access. The hosts were very friendly and responsive, and the studio was exceptionally clean and tidy. We appreciated the detailed instructions in the binder and the extra blankets and towels if needed.
For it being a studio kitchen, It was still well stocked. We loved the tea and hot pot and used the fridge and freezer as well as the washing machine.
The hosts and their dog live above the studio, so we occasionally heard footsteps, but for the most part it was very quiet (we actually could have used a fan at night for some white noise so we didn’t hear each other!)
Since this stay was at the end of our trip, the one bedroom studio for three of us did start to feel a little small after a couple of days, but we were gone so much enjoying what the area head to offer that we were really only there for sleeping!
There is a great paved trail nearby for running or biking."
