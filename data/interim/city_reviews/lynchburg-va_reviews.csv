Stayed a few nights","I had a wonderful time staying at Mason’s airbnb. The space was perfect for me to stay at and was a great location not too far from Liberty University. Bed was very comfy! My only thing I would warn others is if you are planning on staying at the apartment for most of your time, it will be common for you to hear the family upstairs moving around including some little ones running and crying. While I didn’t mind it much, I know some people could get bothered by it."

Stayed one night","My husband and I stayed over as a midway stop point on our trip to South Carolina for Thanksgiving.
We enjoyed our stay on both nights! The location is easy to find and instructions are very clear. Everything is clean, and has some thoughtful touches - a small coffee station, board games, and books. A white noise machine is even provided in the bedroom. I appreciated this thought since, as mentioned in some other reviews, you can hear the family in the floor above (small amount of television noise and footsteps.
This was absolutely no issue, and to be expected during the holidays as I'm assuming they were prepping for Thanksgiving, as many families were! I am a lighter sleeper than my husband, but always bring earbuds to wear just in case. I slept well.
There were a couple minors things - like a coffee cup still had stains on it - but Mason was apologetic and responsive when I brought anything to his attention. Again, totally reasonable to miss something during the holidays."

The coffee station provided was much appreciated! We even had homemade brownies! The bed was super comfortable. I knew about the noise from the kids upstairs from the previous reviews but it was actually louder than I anticipated the fist night we were there. The second night was not so bad. We had some issues with the TV but Mason was super responsive and solved the problem right away. Overall, a good place to stay!"

It is relatively easy to baby proof once you’re there. We just put everything our 1 year old could get into on top of the microwave. Mason was very responsive and pleasant to communicate with. I would definitely recommend staying here while in Lynchburg.

Stayed a few nights","A great stay in Lynchburg!
Mason's place is clean, welcoming, and homey. Mason was quick to communicate, accommodating, let us check in early, and wanted to make sure myself and my partner had a great stay.
The unit was incredibly clean and comfy. Wouldn't suit more than 2, which I believe is the occupant limit for the booking. The bed was super comfy and soft, if you need something stiffer for back pain... Not the bed for you! The water was hot and bathroom clean.
We used the fire pit with our own wood and lighter; though Mason was kind and offered to help with the lighting of the fire if we didn't have it covered.
It's a great location, quick jaunt to church, coffee shops, and hikes.
While I've got NOTHING against kids (very pro-kiddos around here), if you're looking for absolute peace and silence, perhaps look elsewhere. My partner and I weren't bothered, but you can def hear the family in the upstairs portion of the home. Not a deal breaker -- A good booking!"

Be aware that this is a young family and they have small children who run and play upstairs. But, Mason is very clear about this in his description of the apartment. Didn't bother us at all. And, it was quiet through the night. Mason was an excellent host. Very responsive. The little gas fireplace ran out of propane, and we had a space heater within minutes. Enjoyed our short stay. would definitely stay again."

The rental was in pristine shape and well equipped for an overnight stay with amenities. I especially love the few snacks that we’re available because I didn’t have time to grab snacks. I would recommend this to any single person or a couple that need a good private place to camp out and still be close to Liberty University.
Other restaurants and needed services were very close by. Great place to rent for the price point and would rent again, with no question."

Location was excellent, as it was close to everything in Lynchburg and Forest, but it was secluded and very quiet. Left a very good impression"

As the host mentioned in the listing, if you work nights and are a light sleeper this is definitely not a good place to stay. The walls must be very thin because the noises from upstairs are definitely louder than any other basement air bnb I ever stayed out. I was fine because I always sleep with the tv on loudly and take a lot of melatonin. I would stay again. Thanks for hosting me and thank you so much for the late check out!!"

It is mentioned in the listing but both bedrooms are accessible by stairs which are a little steep, so this would definitely not be the place if you have any mobility issues. Other than that, it was cozy and nicely decorated and felt like home. We would definitely stay here again!"

Her yard was blooming with purple flowers during my stay and you could hear hundreds of beautiful bird songs throughout the day. The house is compact but perfect. I was able to use the kitchen to cook a full rack of ribs and buttered tilapia. The windows let a ton of light in throughout the day. I love the access to the backyard. Mike and Dabney were such kind hosts and chatted mindfully with me when I was outside. Overall, lovely, and I hope to go back again."

Stayed a few nights","Some pros of the place was that it was stylish, accurate location, cool things to do in the area (like caverns), and had everything as listed (enjoyed some apple tv and had plenty of towels). Some cons was that there were dead bugs on the floor and cobwebs. It is kind of expected in forest areas but still was quite a few. The wifi did work but was very spotty so it's not great to conduct business. The upstairs is hot but they provided a portable fan."

Stayed a few nights","Check in was easy, location is stellar despite being close to the train which you can hear multiple times a day. Unfortunately this unit is in a converted warehouse and the construction of the units are glaringly cheap. You can hear everything through the walls because of this and the floors are incredibly loud to walk on. I alerted the host I had an allergy to tide pods in regards to the sheets/towels and I wasn’t accommodated for that and told that’s simply what house-keeping uses, which was unfortunate. The furniture is old with piling fabric and covered in hair that sticks to your clothes so bring a lint roller, and beware of mystery brown stains on the pillows. The shower head had significant black mold as did the line for the sprayer for the kitchen sink. Window sills were covered in little dead bugs and dust. I don’t expect luxury but I was disappointed with this being a “super host” property. I wouldn’t stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","This is a difficult review to write because I know that the host did their best to make a nice place and many of these factors are beyond their control. The pros: light, airy, clean, cool warehouse vibe. Altogether a good value for the money for some.
The cons: noise. Located right next to train tracks and an intersection where the train signal comes down. Also the train blows its horn at the intersection, at least twice a night. Moreover, the floors squeak. It seems like they built the lofts with no sound-proofing. We could hear every footstep, most conversations, and the wild sex upstairs at 4AM. Then there was a strange banging in the bedroom wall...maybe water pipes when someone used the water upstairs? The bed itself squeaked and the mattress was old and sagged in the middle. Two of the four nights we were there I didn't get any sleep.
The TV remote didn't work; the batteries inside were corroded. We appreciated the Netflix. There was a coffee machine but not coffee."

The kitchen is rudimentary, so if you're planning to do any serious cooking, bring what you need with you. Otherwise, a great space in a great location at a reasonable price."

Because I usually have one of my sons with me, I like having some privacy and the full kitchen. Kandise has been so helpful when we've had to adjust our plans."

Stayed a few nights","This place was a nice little getaway. It was the perfect size for 2 people. It was very clean and the furniture was comfortable. The shower was probably my favorite. The water pressure was so strong it felt like a power wash for people. The location was perfect for the area. Since it is at the end of the street you do not hear the bar noise yet everything was within walking distance. Close to the colleges if you are visiting your kid to watch them in their chosen sport.
The host was friendly and very responsive. We had no needs but I am sure she would have assisted us promptly.
One thing to remember when renting a refurbished building is that the floors are going to be uneven and squeak. If you go in with that understanding, you will not be disappointed."

Everything was spotless and the bed was very comfortable. I liked being next to the tracks because I love the sound of a train and it's whistle.
The location was perfect and I found two great restaurants. There were lots of places to walk, but I'll have to wait until next time to go up the steps to Monument Terrace."

Stayed a few nights","This place looks amazing from the pictures and I booked it since it has so many good reviews. Heres what you can expect. The building itself is an old tobacco warehouse, so it has that new ""Instagram"" renovation thing going for it. However, the second floor - where this unit is - has three other investment units all which are rented on AirBnB. Longer term residents live above and below on the first and third floors respectively. It has a nice feel to it at first, but whomever rehabbed it didn't spend the extra cash to better insulate the building and fine tune the rehab. I know it's hard and expensive to accomplish. It's worth noting that you can hear the conversations of whomever else is staying next door in the other units. The first two nights I was there, there was a couple on a different floor who fought with each other from 2-4am... nonstop (another resident mentioned to me this happens with some frequency). Also, while I'm on the topic, the building is located literally 10' away from an intersection where the trains that run through Lynchburg are required to use their horn. This happens throughout the day and night and no amount of ear plugs will help. The single pane glass on the windows shakes from it. The furnishings are OK, things like t.p. and paper towels are as cheap as they get, the washing machine's gasket is covered in black mold (in my unit) - which is hard to get out of your clothes if you need to do laundry. I know it might seem trivial, but those are things to consider before booking. I likely wouldn't stay here again given the other options in the area. It's a bit of a shame because it feels like it had so much potential, bit at least for me, getting a good night's rest is important when I travel."

It is accessible by walking to the River trail, and lots of downtown places! We went to the community market on Saturday morning, which was lovely. We had a sight hiccup upon check-in, but the communication with Kandise was pretty quick and we got it figured out. The bed is quite a bit softer than we are used to, but again, not a big deal really. There is a coffee maker for coffee in the morning, and the lighting in the living room is lovely for morning coffee time. The noise from other apartment rooms and the hallway cab be a little loud at night, but it's not too bad. If you are a very light sleeper, maybe it could be difficult, but it wasn't too bad for us! We very much enjoyed Lynchburg and our weekend stay!"

Stayed one night","We had a great stay at the loft! It’s in a great location for exploring downtown Lynchburg within walking distance to restaurants, breweries, and the farmer’s market. The loft is clean and airy with industrial charm. The bed was very soft which isn’t normally our preference but might be just what others are looking for.
Kandise was a great host and very responsive! My fiancé and I had a little miscommunication about the booking and Kandise was quick to respond and very helpful with fixing things for us!
Overall a great weekend getaway!"

However, Kandise did respond quickly, and after a couple of tries, we were able to get in. Once in, we enjoyed our stay. Lynchburg is a great little town, and the dinner recommendation for RA was excellent! If we returned, we would probably stay again - the difficulties at check-in are the only thing that prevents the fifth star."

But the others who rent have no common courtesy for others. We are told to be respectful when we stay but yet they are not. Loud party below until 5am and gang banging going on upstairs until 4 am. Got no rest while there. Very thin walls. Sounds like everyone else is in your place. Would not recommend on weekends at all. Nothing but a party building. Sad, because i thought i found my place when traveling to Lynchburg, unfortunately i have not."

This is not a reflection on the apartment at all, but we were a little disappointed about the COVID precautions during our brief stop in Lynchburg itself. Hardly anyone anywhere we went were wearing masks, which concerned us while we were in town. The apartment however felt very clean and safe!!"

Percival’s Island is right out the front door and has river access and a shaded, paved recreation path. We enjoyed a nice, long walk with our dogs. Several nice-looking restaurants are also within walking distance, though we did not have a chance to try them on this trip.
The building is located at the edge of town immediately beside railroad tracks. There was a bit of infrequent noise from freight trains passing through but it didn’t bother us. This apartment building and some of the surrounding streets are very nice and updated, but other parts seem a little run down and rough. The unit does come with off-street parking and coded access to the building, and we did not have any safety issues.
If you are looking for a comfy spot in Lynchburg, we highly recommend this apartment and would definitely stay again."

Stayed with a pet","This home has been amazingly restored with a unique mixture of old, new and industrial. The thoughtful touches and original pieces show the loving care that went into creating a welcoming and unique space which is evident on every inch of the place. Dwayne has thought of every amenity and then some. He has stocked the place as if your family and beloved dog had made an unexpected stop at his house and had nothing but clothes with you. The gates to the parking area made the space even more dog friendly allowing our large dog to have some freedom to stretch his legs while we were there. The bathrooms are so gorgeous I was sending pictures to my husband as we are planing on resorting our own bathroom soon. The area seems to be being revitalized, there is a beautiful diversity of people in this historic neighborhood. The community gatherings are even posted on the wall in the kitchen adding to the feeling of being home. Be blessed Dwayne you have a gift!"

Stayed with a pet",we've stayed in countless AirBnBs and this was one of the most warm welcoming and dare I say bougie ones we've stayed in. mix that with the amazing price and this is an AirBnB worth making a trip around instead of being just a lodging. When you're visiting Lynchburg you need Oysters and beer from Water Dog and Amazing craft cocktails from Glass House. They're across the street from each other and a casual 1 mile walk from the house.

The detail and overall aesthetic along with everything available, made for a beyond comfortable stay easily made this one of, if not the nicest Airbnb my wife and I have stayed at. The attention to detail with things like make-up wipes, skin sensitive products, Dr Teals bath products and more really show how much he cares about the quality of experience for his guests. Our only regret is that we didn’t have more time to relax there and actually take it in. We would 1000% recommend staying here and will definitely book again if we are ever in the area.

The neighborhood is very peaceful! I went on walks as the sun was coming up in the mornings and felt very comfortable and safe. It is a close drive to Main Street where you can walk around downtown, eat at restaurants, and even visit nearby trails. I recommend visiting some local spots: Bacon St Bagels (breakfast), 5th Street Vito's (Pizza), and Trading Post by Traber Ranch (coffee and other small grocery items). The Point of Honor Trail was a nice small paved trail nearby that takes you through the Hollins Mill Tunnel. This home is a close drive to Liberty University and University of Lynchburg!"

It’s so warm and inviting. The bed is SO comfortable and I rarely ever find that. They even left room/linen spray that smelled amazing! I’ve just never experienced this level of care put into an Airbnb before. It’s usually thrown together but Dwayne’s place clearly has owners that love and care about it. It was sparkling clean and smelled amazing and I just can’t rave about it enough. You will NOT regret staying here! And there’s a cute little bagel place around the corner. Private parking. Historic neighborhood. Everything was 10/10! We will definitely be back!

A few of these stand out features of this listing: the mattresses are extremely therapeutic as well as the pillows. The cleanliness of the place is exceptional. The high end, fixtures, and quality of the appliances are unreal! The home its self is so tranquil, and calming. I must commend this owner as the added accommodations were beyond any other Airbnb. The outside amenities were exceptional as well. What a wonderful place to relax with views of the mountains! Thank you to the owner for sharing your space.

Stayed a few nights","Dwayne’s house was everything we hoped it would be…and more. The location was very convenient and easily accessible.
The renovations to the house (seen in before photos) were amazing. The amenities went beyond are expectations.
I would highly recommend staying at Uprising. (I actually did recommend his home as a couple pulled in the driveway to take a look at the house for a friend. I suggested their friend should absolutely stay at Uprising)."

Stayed a few nights","I stayed at Mini Manor two nights with my adult daughter and son while we were visiting my oldest who lives in Lynchburg. Our host Denise contacted me before our stay and answered any questions I had. Everything at the house was just as described and we had no trouble finding it or getting in and out. The family room was big enough for us to gather and play games at night and we each had our own bed. My daughter was happy because coffee supplies were provided. We all enjoyed the nice tv and wifi reception. My personal favorites about the house include that it’s a little off the beaten path, yet still not far from everything we wanted to do. Mini Manor also has a lush green yard and two rockers perfect for reading, talking, and just relaxing on the front porch. Music was provided in the form of a variety of bird chirps, which just added to the tranquil atmosphere of the place. We had a wonderful stay and we hope to be able to book Mini Manor again in the future!"

The house was in a great location with plenty of restaurants/bars, convenient stores, and grocery stores just a short drive away!

Stayed a few nights","To say It's ok is an overstatement, don't expect nothing great.. First the floors are not level & you're constantly leaning while you are walking.. Stains on all the towels, sheets, etc.. The internet is hit & miss at the best.. You have an attic access door right above your head while lying in bed.. The bed tilts you into the middle of the bed.. The bed is very cheaply & hardly even put together, one day the top corner fell in & we had to fix this ourselves.. The stove is disgusting & so is the washer & dryer.. Either the fridge isn't level or the floor tilts the fridge too, for nothing lays flat in the fridge as we found out by laying drinks on the top shelf.. I never felt safe, constantly heard weird noises, the attic door above the bed, stains on everything, no drapes to cover the windows with holes in the front blinds.. Lamps are so cheap & light they fall over at nothing.. The bedroom closet doesn't have enough room to open without moving the nightstand & then it still can't open but so much.. I'd never go back.."

Stayed a few nights","10 STARS!!!!!! We visited for our sons graduation from Liberty. Beautiful neighborhood and beautiful home. This walk out basement apartment greets its guest with a private entrance and patio. We enjoyed relaxing, eating and playing games at the large table as we listened to the soothing stream run through the backyard. At dusk we would see deer meander thru the yard as they walked past the firepit.
The apartment was clean, comfortable and decorated nicely with plenty of games and DVDs to keep you entertained. The kitchenette was well stocked with thoughtful snacks, paper items and kitchen utensils. The 2 bedrooms were decorated nicely with fresh clean bedding and closet space to match your needs. The large, clean, bright and well stocked bathroom made it easy for our family of 4.
John and Barb are amazing hosts. They made sure to say hello but gave us privacy for our stay. We will definitely be back."

The space is comfortable and we felt right at home! The kitchenette is well stocked, and there were some sweet extras they provided as well, such as bottled water and tea bags.
There’s no separate controllable AC for summertime, but they kept the temp at a comfortable level for us. I have no doubt that they’d have been responsive if we’d needed it changed.
There’s no sink in the kitchenette, but they make getting clean dishes clear in their instructions.
The backyard is beautiful and serene. We even saw a deer in the neighboring yard!
If we come back to the area for a short stay, we’ll absolutely look at coming back to this sweet home again!"

The disappointing areas of the Airbnb - no kitchen sink or stove, the owners live upstairs so that was not communicated when we read about the Airbnb, the AC was controlled by the owners so there were times it was warm and stuffy, we felt we had to be quiet because we could hear all the noise from upstairs, i.e. walking, grandchildren, talking. We actually checked out a day earlier than our reservation."

A little more clarification that you would be staying under an occupied family dwelling would be helpful as we were hoping for more privacy and felt we needed to be extra quiet while unwinding from the days travel. Other than that excellent host and amenities and a good place to lay your head for the night."

It was more than spacious, EXTREMELY clean, and equipped with a few travel essentials and a surplus of extra linens to accommodate almost any temporary sleeping arrangement. In learning that my dog could no longer stay boarded due to the in coming storm, John insisted that I not find other boarding arrangements and allowed him to stay with us on our last night. They are such a hospitable couple, and I will be recommending them to anyone I know visiting the area !!"

Stayed a few nights","What a great week! A few things that guests should be aware:
1) I recommend that you arrive there before dark the first time so you can commandeer the driveway that wraps around the house… I learned it was easier to back down the driveway rather than drive in headfirst!
2. The lack of a stove is really no big deal. You have a toaster oven, microwave and a single burner to heat things up on if need be.
3. The lack of a kitchen sink was a bit unusual, HOWEVER, the homeowners really have thought of EVERYTHING! They made sure that the faucet in the bathroom is one you’d typically find at a kitchen sink and the water gets REALLY hot! Plus, you have the option of leaving your dirty dishes out and a magical fairy washes them for you!
The backyard is magical! The deer are so fun to watch and the babbling brook is very soothing…
I’d definitely give this place 12 stars if I could!"

They did a wonderful job of making it feel as close to home as possible.
The beds were comfortable and the house was spotless!
The extra blankets and games were a great addition!
They were so easy to reach and responded very quickly.
We will be back very soon."

Having 2 upstairs bedrooms, each with a full bathroom, was perfect for two couples or a family. Kitchen was fully equipped with all needed appliances and equipment for us to enjoy meals ""at home"". Highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","The place was immaculate but the beds really need to have box springs added to aid in the people that are handicapped or that have bad backs because you basically are sleeping almost on the ground, and being a person that is handicapped it was impossible to get in and out without major added pain. I hate to complain but it would be an issue that would be very easily corrected with some box springs and better mattresses. Not a bad price or bad place for the money!"

Nice desk facing a window, shoe rack so we had somewhere to put our shoes, all the basic toiletries in full sizes, nice bed linens.
For being a townhouse, the place was extremely quiet, yet so convenient and close to everything. Super easy to find, and the hosts were super accommodating. Our reserved parking spot was directly in front of our door, the keyless entry is so easy to use, and the laminated list of helpful info was convenient to refer to without having to search emails on our phones. On top of that, check out was super simple.
This place was a great find and I would stay again! Thank you for providing such a comfortable stay."

This place was so close to LU and very convenient. Our boys attended LU Men’s Basketball Camp for a few days.
We have nothing but wonderful things to say. The townhome was equipped with all our needs. Everything that you need while away from your home is here. They have thought of it all… 😊
from foil in the kitchen to Q-Tips in the bathroom… they’ve gotta covered! Even leftover containers if you make food in the kitchen and you want to store some of it for lunch the next day.
They were available if we needed anything and made sure to check in on us during our stay!
We are thankful this place was available as we made last minute plans to come in to town.
Will definitely remember this place for next time we return to the area. A home away from our home! Great hosts!"

Stayed a few nights","This review is meant to share details NOT already mentioned in the hosts description. When traveling, we need a place that has a kitchen bc of our need for cooking multiple meals during our stay. When entering, the place had a “you are home” feel to it. The hosts, Josiah & Jael were thoughtful to not just provide dinnerware & flatware for their guests, but also a whole set of child safe dinnerware & flatware. They provided an array of cooking pots & pans along with a wide variety of utensils & tools needed for multiple cooking & baking needs. There is one drawer providing plastic wrap, foil & baggies. One cabinet had a bag of sugar, flour & a few basic spices. Along with hand soap in every bathroom, they also provided the necessary supplies to do laundry as well as the dishes or use the dishwasher. They had ample paper products for the kitchen & bathrooms. They even added a table top Christmas tree to their decorations. They immediately met any needs that came up (which were very few)"

My daughter made use of the washer dryer combo! She brought her own pods, but noticed that detergent/ softener was conveniently provided.

Everything was so clean and comfortable, and my husband and I both agreed that the shower was absolutely luxurious! There was a beautiful view from the deck, and we enjoyed spending time outside in the yard. Marc and Cari were so easy to communicate with and were incredibly accommodating and understanding. They provided us with everything we needed, even some toys for our toddler to play with during our stay. We got the privilege of meeting Cari shortly after we checked in, and she was so sweet and kind, telling us to let her know if we needed anything. I have no doubts that if we are ever needing to stay in the area again, the Cozy Cottage would be our first choice!"

Stayed a few nights","I had an amazing g stay. It was exactly what I needed and wanted…peace and solitude.
I slept great in an extremely comfortable bed, had no issues with temperature and was able to grind fresh beans for coffee each morning.
The location was great and it was perfect for concentrating on homework.
I was well cared for by the entire family and edified one night before bed with eternal words from above.
I loved every minute there and I highly recommend it. I will be back. Thank you so much and God bless."

Communication was easy and the touches in the cottage like space were thoughtful. We made breakfast there each morning and enjoyed fresh coffee provided by the hosts. Other snacks such as s’more fixings, popcorn and hot chocolate were a treat for my young daughter with me. Clean and comfortable and even a great sunset view. Would definitely stay again."

She even brought over supplies for us to make s’mores on the porch (which has a fire pit) the evening her own kids and their friends were also making them on their own fire pit. What a special treat!

And the surrounding neighborhood was nice, quiet, and spacious. Plus this location is super convenient to so many places we frequently visit!
We appreciated the full kitchen and the goodies, snacks, and beverages waiting for us. Plus we liked the extras, such as a full mirror and additional blankets. And the deck, seating, fire pit, and lighting are absolutely perfect. Too bad it was way too hot at night, and we chose not to use them.
We thank you for your kindness and connection during our stay. And we appreciated the late check out. We'd love to stay here again in early November but see that youre quite booked up for many upcoming weekends. We'll have to try

The outdoor deck served us well as an extra workspace and additional relaxing outdoor living space. It was also a very pleasant surprise to notice the efforts of the hosts to utilize organic and safer types of products, where reasonable, throughout the cottage. This is a very positive and uplifting setting in every way and very well suited with everything and more than we could have needed. It's closeness to Liberty U enabled my son to get to us easily and vice versa. There is a wonderful grocery within 3 mins and I was able to buy very nice products and gifts too for our trip and visits. Hope to visit again!"

Cari provided some great personal touches including roses from the garden on the dining table and dresser.

It was super convenient from everything needed in town! No complaints from either of us. The bed was really comfy which was great after super long days at the festival. 10/10 would recommend and will stay again if we’re ever in the area again! Thank you so much again! :)

The bed is comfy - a nice big shower with good water pressure, there was a deck with a table and chairs - private parking, very nice amenities like a brita water pitcher, chocolates, coffee, seltzer and I appreciated the packets of oatmeal! It's all in one big space that offers a nice kitchenette, a 2 person dining table, small stove and fridge, I love the farmhouse kitchen sink! There's also a living area with a couch and chair and then an area for the bed. It's very inviting and my hosts were super responsive. I look forward to staying again when I am in town or I might just make plans to bring my husband for a weekend getaway."

Past conversations with Cari, I knew she had provided my favorite tea (Earl Grey). Also, if you drink coffee then there is stuff for that and oatmeal packets. There were fresh flowers on the table, which was a nice touch. I enjoyed the magazines and deck of question cards. A nice neighborhood, I walked around the block and said hi to a couple people. When I went on the deck, I saw deer two nights in a row! I even saw a skunk! A perfect stay. Thanks for the hard work that goes into maintaining the cottage. It’s something to be proud of."

Clean - spotless, too. Brooke goes above and beyond for her guests, and I will keep coming back because of that! Thank you for always being so friendly and helpful Brooke. Your place is really a lifesaver for me, and my family, when coming into town to see our LU student!"

Check in was super easy and Brooke had great communication before my arrival."

It has been nicely renovated with bright lighting, laminate wood floors, and cute interior design. It is in a vert well maintained neighborhood, located just down the street from Kroger and Starbucks and close to Liberty University. We stayed for the weekend and the place was very quiet except for occasional footsteps and voices, which was expected. The entire place was extremely clean and comfortable. There were many extras that made us feel welcome, such as coffee pods, creamer, bottled water, and snacks. The bathroom had large bottles of shampoo and body wash with fresh towels. We were fortunate enough to meet the owner briefly and she had a delightful personality! We plan to return soon. Thanks for a great experience!"

It smelled great, and it was in such outstanding condition that it appeared I was the very first guest Brooke had ever hosted. IT LOOKED BRAND NEW! Very relaxing decor and so spacious. Just a few steps from my car in their driveway. Brooke was an outstanding communicator and made sure I understood that there would be a small gathering of friends upstairs before she accepted my reservation. It was very quiet and not a problem whatsoever. Her home is in a safe and quiet neighborhood. I even enjoyed sitting in the swing under her back deck. I have been traveling a lot lately, and this is, by far, one of the best values I have run across."

Stayed a few nights","Overall, everything was fine. Apartment was clean and functional. Location is in a very nice and safe area. Easy access to main roads and restaurants.
Negatively, the tub/shower would be a little difficult possibly for older or physically limited guests to access. We would have like to had a few more bath towels available as there weren’t enough for a three day stay. Lastly, which was probably out of our hosts control because of rain everyday, we had to kill several “spiders” in the apartment. I don’t think it is a constant issue, they were just looking for a dry area.
I know some of my review seems very negative, but I would have no qualms staying there again when coming back to Lynchburg."

Stayed one night","We are a regular Airbnb travelers and would rate Brooke’s place as one of the nicest, best located, and a real value of all the places we have stayed. The place was very clean, modern, had everything we needed to feel at home. The location was an easy commute to all the sites we wanted to get to during our visit. Communication was great! We would highly recommend this wonderful suite and looking forward to book with her again in the very near future."

After a few stays in hotels we were happy to find we could stay for two nights in this Airbnb, compared to one night at a hotel. We loved the quiet neighborhood and cozy accommodations. The host was very helpful, quick to respond to messages and a pleasure to work with. We will definitely be back."

She allowed us to check in extremely late because our flight which was a redeye into Richmond had gotten delayed and even offered us to be able to check out late which we couldn't due to the time we were needed to be at the nearby courthouse. We couldn't have asked for better and the price was the most affordable.

I especially appreciated the Keurig and the disposable coffee cups with lids so I could take my coffee to work with me in the morning. I didn't get a chance to enjoy the porch with the swing but it looked very nice and peaceful. Kroger is right up the road and some delivery places are close by. Very beautiful autumn colors and a quiet neighborhood.
