Stayed a few nights","This place was exactly what we needed for a short weekend get away in San Diego! The studio was small, but it was clean, tidy, comfortable, and perfect for a home base while we explored. Very walkable to a lot of great restaurants and fun shops in North Park. Highly recommend!"

Stayed one night","I was only able to stay one night in San Diego, however, I would have stayed for a month at this lovely home if I could. You can tell they love and care for the entire property and the fact that they are artists really shows. The studio (tower) that I stayed in was so peaceful and charming and I woke up to the sweetest birdsong. All of the spaces that you can see from the window and the studio's own private space are really lovely. I hope to go back to SD soon, and if this place is available that is where you'll find me."

Loved it - Wolf and Blair are very friendly, we got to chat to them and they gave us some more local recommendations that we took. Panama 66 in the museum district!"

Stayed one night","I stayed at Wolf's Tower which truly exceeded my expectations in every way. Wolf was amazing, providing not only great instructions before my arrival but also ensuring a seamless check-in and check-out process. His attention to detail made the entire experience incredibly stress-free.
The place itself was exactly as described. It was clean and smelled great and had everything a person could need! One of the best aspects of this Airbnb was its privacy and quietness. Perfect escape away from the bustle.
The location in the North Park neighborhood was perfect. It was easily walkable to a park and eateries, making it easy to immerse myself in the locality.
Parking, which can often be a hassle, was surprisingly easy at this location. I never had any issues finding a spot, which was a huge relief.
Lastly, the host's hospitality shone through in every aspect of my stay, making it a memorable and enjoyable experience. I highly recommend The Tower!"

He was always very receptive with anything I needed to reach out to him about, and gave me excellent recommendations for places to eat and hang out around the neighborhood. Wolf's dedication to keeping the airbnb clean upon arrival, both inside and outside, was very apparent, as I didn't notice anything that raised a red flag in terms of blemishes or sanitation. All in all, I believe that anyone who chooses to rent from Wolf will be very impressed with what they pay for, and he receives my highest recommendation as a host."

Stayed a few nights","Wolf was very accommodating off the bat. You are ensured privacy for the most part, Wolf was so kind to allow a late checkout, he replied promptly and kindly. Kitchen is wonderful- tiny but perfect for a solo person’s needs. The television is difficult to use and froze multiple times but I doubt many of us are here for the television when the grounds/surrounding areas are so beautiful. Water pressure in shower is extremely strong, go easy on the tap and you’ll be alright. Such a beautiful space decorated by artists while being art itself."

One thing I will bring next time will be a shower cap. The showerhead pours directly down, so if you’re not trying to wash your hair that day :) bring a shower cap.
I really look forward to staying back at Wolf and Blair‘s Airbnb next time I’m traveling to San Diego or even check out their other Airbnb on the property for myself and my family."

One note for people with larger bodies: the shower is incredibly small. This isn’t a problem with the shower, just something folks should be aware of if they prefer or need a little more room to move freely while showering.
I loved this space and thoroughly enjoyed my stay!"

Stayed one night","Pros: Nice small space in a quiet neighborhood, and a super-quick walk to Balboa Park, and to North Park restaurants and bars, which was perfect for me. Instructions for finding the key and getting in were very clear. Cons: A little hot during the day, and a little cold at night. Found a little fan tucked away in the closet which was helpful to keep air moving, but still a little stuffy; would recommend the owner install a ceiling fan if possible. But still worth the stay."

The neighborhood is so nice, full of great architecture and fantastic gardens. We really enjoyed walking to some wonderful restaurants, and the neighborhood felt very safe. We loved watching the hummingbirds in the beautiful bougainvillea outside on the balcony and watching the amazing sunsets. The place is immaculately clean, safe, and comfortable. We were given all the space we needed to have privacy, but felt that if we needed anything, our host was available, and that was a nice feeling."

Stayed a few nights","Stayed at Wolf's place for 4 nights for work and had a great stay here!
Pros: Wolf is highly responsive and courteous, instructions to access the unit were clear, neighborhood was so peaceful yet close to tons of restaurants/breweries and parking was surprisingly easy considering its North Park. Very cute balcony space and unit got a lot of lovely light during the day!
Things to consider: The shower was very small, so it was manageable for me as a 5'3 individual but may be tight for some others. Kitchenette has 2 stove top burners and a mini toaster, but no microwave (which would be more helpful as someone who kept having leftovers from eating out). The space is definitely for 2 max but I think its more comfortable for individuals traveling alone.
Overall, I had a comfortable stay as I was mostly out and about and valued the safety, location, and accessibility of things to do more!"

Close to Balboa Park and the San Diego Zoo, not a long drive to the beach for sunset and Old Town San Diego was fun too. As an added bonus, I got to meet Wolf and his wife and enjoyed talking with them - lovely couple!
I highly recommend this place!"

Where this place fell short for me was the cleanliness of the place. Towels had strains, and the bed had hair on it. It was hot most days, and the wall AC unit wasn't up to pair. TLDR; nice place, but for a couple extra dollars, a hotel is the way to go."

The property is in a safe neighborhood, enclosed behind a locked gate for added security, and an easy 10 minute stroll to coffee, ramen, and other restaurants/bars.

The best part, without a doubt, was the proximity to the plethora of amazing restaurants, coffee shops, bars and boutiques in North Park. The shower cubicle was a tad too small even for a petite lady like myself, but the rest of the space was well-lit and inviting and thereby made up for it. I look forward to staying here again on my next visit to SD!"

Stayed a few nights","A little gem! This cute studio has everything you need even for a ~week-long stay. I was in town for a wedding weekend and decided to stay a few extra days. The location is quiet with pretty easy street parking. At the same time it's easy to walk to cute coffee shops and restaurants in 5-10 minutes. Best of both worlds
Check-in instructions were given in advance and were very clear. Same with checkout.
The studio itself is so cute. Small but mighty. It's cozy but has lots of light from the windows. Some cool books, and cute little (handmade?) illustrations. Could not have been happier. Also the porch is so nice to sit on in the morning drinking your coffee or any other time of day or night.
Wifi is solid, water pressure is excellent, even beach towels are supplied. Thanks for a great stay!"

Stayed a few nights","The check-in process couldn’t have been easier. The tower room felt private and safe, and was cozy. The location is close to many restaurants and breweries.
The interior would be charming if it was updated a little. The walls need a coat of paint, the desk was reminiscent of old student housing, and there are mildew stains on the wood around the towel hangers in the bathroom.
A little effort and it would be very cute. As it was, it was practical and efficient."

Stayed one night","My boyfriend and I traveled to San Diego and it was perfect for a one night stay! Wolf was very accommodating (check-in time is after 3 but he allowed us to check in an hour early) and he responded quickly (less than thirty minutes after I would reach out to him). The entire studio is basically one room with a bed, small kitchen, desk, and connecting bathroom, but it was very comfortable. Everything was clean and looked almost new. Wolf also left us a map of the area and recommendations, which we really appreciated. We felt safe in the area and the location was beautiful. My only gripe is that the shower was very small and hard to move around in, but it got the job done. I would definitely stay here again :)"

Stayed over a week","Overall, I enjoyed my two weeks (solo) at this location. I wouldn’t recommend it for multiple travelers, or anyone hoping to cook - the kitchen is extremely small and shares space with the only closet. Pay close attention to check out instructions - I had an unfortunate experience where Wolf charged me an additional $50 because I didn’t clean the place to an acceptable level before I checked out. Given I was already paying an $80 cleaning fee, I wasn’t expecting an additional charge, regardless of dishes in sink and unmade bed. Also, my car was broken into while parked on the street outside. The neighborhood seemed perfectly safe otherwise, but just worth noting."

The place will provide your needs if you are staying for a few nights. The bathroom and bed were a little smaller than anticipated, especially for two adults.

We didn’t get to meet Wolf this time around as he was out of town but everything was organised perfectly and any questions we had were answered straight away via Air BnB. We would definitely come back and can only recommend wolf’s place!

It's set in a quiet residential area in San Diego and has everything you need! In addition, it was very clean and Wolf was happy to help us with questions. We would definitely come again!"

Stayed a few nights","We were so lucky to find this little gem for such a good price in San Diego! It was easy to find and there was plenty of parking (free!!!) on the street in a safe, quiet residential neighborhood. The location is only about 15 minutes from everything if you avoid rush hour traffic. The apartment is a detached guest house behind the main house and is very private, with large windows that look out over their beautiful, naturally landscaped, backyard. The bed was large and comfortable. There is a twin-size pullout couch that my daughter thought was amazing - she got to watch tv in bed! 😂 The minifridge and microwave were useful, and there is a heater/ac unit that kept us warm at night. The bathroom is large and updated, and the decor throughout the house was charming. We didn't need to reach out to Cory while we were there, but he checked with us right after we arrived to make sure we got in okay, and let us know to reach out if we had any questions. Perfect stay!"

Stayed a few nights","very nice cozy spot! it’s very residential so it was a great quiet peaceful place to rest. my big thing is a clean bathroom and i mostly feel uncomfortable showering barefoot in most accommodations and we specifically chose this airbnb because the photos made it seem like the bathroom was pretty pristine, and we were very pleased to see that it matched the photos. we’re not ones to spend too much time at our hotel/airbnb in general other than to sleep and shower but if our itinerary wasn’t so jam-packed, we would have loved to spend some time in the backyard area. we drove in from vegas and we had no issue with parking, which was a huge relief. cory was an amazing host as well, all instructions were very clear and while i typically don’t reach out unless absolutely necessary, i really appreciated how he took the time to check in with us, making sure we had everything we needed. thank you for providing a really relaxing space for us to stay on our little weekend getaway!"

I was in SD for Legoland, SeaWorld and a day trip up the 5 to Disneyland! That’s a great trip for a 4.5 year old boy! However, when one would rather lay in the hammock, go in and out the slider of bungalow to strum the guitar or hang outside under the lights of the amazing outdoor patio, it was so darn relaxing and peaceful. It has great internet and just about every app on the Roku to relax and watch a movie. The experience was exactly what I needed for my son and myself. Thanks again Cory! Looking forward to the next time!"

Stayed a few nights","Cory's bungalow was absolutely amazing! His hospitality was so appreciated, as well. The space is exactly as it appears in the photos-- spacious, centrally located (about 15 mins max from all the hot spots), clean, and so comfortable! My only complaint is that I couldn't just move in!! Cory made check-in and out super simple and was so friendly. I encountered some hiccups that Cory was kind enough to help me sort out in order to ensure my trip went off without a hitch. The views from the backyard and room are not lacking whatsoever and there's so much space; i was able to fully immerse myself into vacation mode and relax like I haven't ever been able to before in an Airbnb. No detail of this fun space was missed. The bed was comfortable, the pillows were perfectly soft. There's an AC unit in it as well to help beat the SoCal heat which was such a nice amenity. The bathroom is also spacious and the cherry on top of this spot. I cannot wait to visit San Diego again and when I do, I will most definitely be re-booking with Cory. Do not pass this spot up!!!"

Super comfortable bed, amazing shower/bathroom space and useful amenities.
My husband and I had no idea how chilly San Diego can get, and it even needed up raining during our stay, so we loved that Cory had extra blankets available for us to use. AND A FIREPLACE!! Game changer lol
When we walked in, we were greeted with a nice bottle of wine, the are was stocked with coffee and plenty of cold waters in the fridge.
Would definitely recommend this AirBnB to others and/or stay here again.

The backyard which we had access to the whole time has a BBQ, bistro lights and several nice seating areas to enjoy sunset and lounging. There is a fire table which we did not use but we hope to next time we visit. Cory was the best host. He was very responsive and helpful by letting us borrow a few items we forgot for our BBQ. Coffee in the room and waters were an added bonus. It was the perfect proximity to SDSU which was the reason we were there. Even our college kids made positive comments about how nice the backyard was when they joined us for a home cooked BBQ meal. We will definitely visit again. Thanks Cory!"

We have a 2 year old and we already carry a lot of stuff with us & it was nice to not have to worry about that. Aside from the beach it’s also super close to restaurants and I would say super close to everything else around San Diego. Place was clean, and accommodated our family of 3 very well.

Inside is too adorable. It is filled with cute beachy pics and other decor and is incredibly well appointed. Inside is everything you could ask for. There is a large, very comfortable bed, desk and chair, (fold-out) couch, coffee table, 2 luggage stands, mirrors, blinds & curtains, nightstands, a dresser, wardrobe with hangers, refrigeratior, microwave, and the 86"" tv. Then there are many considerate extras - keurig with to-go cups, tea bags, honey sticks, robes, ac, great shower, ceiling fan, extension cord outlets, robes, bottles of water, ample fluffy towels, ear plugs, cotton pads, Q-tips, lighted make-up mirror, wine and beer openers and cups and more. There is even an electric fireplace! The host lent me a hat upon my request. The family is friendly. Quick walk to restaurants & the beach. We loved it!"

It is within walking distance of many excellent restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and the beach.

Stayed with kids","Quyen's guesthouse was very clean, comfortable and safe. We had a car, so the gated parking was nice. Free street parking was also nice for our adult daughter who visited us (easy spots were always open in front of property). The amenities were so appreciated (robes, waters, TV with apps, beach toys/chairs/towels, outdoor shower & towel rack). They thought of everything! The walk to the beach was a little further than we thought, mainly because the access takes you to a perfect surfing location first - however, the location is right between Pacific Beach and LaJolla beaches, making for a short drive either way. If you are surfing, then this is the perfect place!You can't see the ocean from the property, but the garden is beautiful and relaxing for an evening drink on the patio or coffee in the morning. It's much more quiet then staying in one of the busy beach towns such as Mission or PB, which this family of three appreciated."

The interior was very clean, it had everything we needed and everything was easy to find. There is a monstrous TV, if thats your thing. The couch folded down into a nice bed for our little one. Quyen is extremely responsive and helpful. But, the best part was the bed. My husband and I both loved it (depsite my preference for plush and his preference for firm). The sheets were so buttery soft. We have already purchased the sheets for our home and we're seriously considering buying the mattress. We would live here if we could."

They also had small local shops and restaurants within walking distance of there home. Checking in/out was a breeze. Would definitely come back to stay here again!

Stayed with kids","This place is a hidden gem! It's just a little bit further from the usual beach side properties, but Tourmaline and other beaches are literally minutes' walk away. La Jolla downtown and groceries are also within walking distance. The cottage itself is very beautifully furnished,very clean, and the garden outside is amazing. The free amenities like Nespresso are great as well. Due to lockdown, we did eat a lot more in and would have preferred some plates, dishes and silverware, but the plastic silverware, microwave and mini fridge helped make it easier. We loved Quyen's place and would recommend it to anyone planning to visit SD. If you're visiting with kids, I highly recommend driving to children's pool beach for some up-close seal viewing."

It was a beautiful stay and I felt very safe the entire time! Everyone was wearing masks when we went out to restaurants and people stayed a safe distance away on the beach!! I only wish we could have enjoyed the beach and Quyens guesthouse longer!! Highly highly recommend staying here! Just gorgeous!

It's like the Ritz Carlton for Airbnb's. Everything that I needed and more was available to me. Every time I chose to contact Quyen he responded quickly and with the best suggestions. Not only was Quyen gracious but his whole family was amazing even his sweet doggies Lucky and Angel Baby. Thank you SO much! Anytime I stay in San Diego it'll be at your place.

The guesthouse was spotless and was by far the cleanest Airbnb that I have ever stayed in. In addition to being exceptionally clean, the location was perfect (nestled between Pacific Beach and Downtown LaJolla ... close to everything from great local restaurants, shops and just steps away from the beautiful beach yet peaceful and quiet). The quest house was spacious and comfortable with everything needed for a great vacation. Lastly the gated off street parking next to the guesthouse was perfect. We would definitely stay again at Quyen’s Airbnb."

Pros:
A lot of folks noted that Quyen goes out of his way to provide every amenity thinkable: beach towels, shampoo +conditioner, etc, but it’s just incredible to see the level of care into these details
The location is great too. Quick walk to Pacific Beach and several very popular restaurants. A quick uber ride to bars on Garter street.
The novelty: the guest house has a cool minimalist decor and it’s solar powered
Clarity. Quyen outlines check out procedures in a binder by the door. There’s labels for every remote and every electronic device
Cons:
All the remote control devices/information overload got a little overwhelming. I had one for the TV, AC unit, fireplace, and fan.
The door you enter/exit from faces the host’s house so sometimes they see you or you see them. I’m sort of a self conscious person so I was surprised to see/hear people so easily.
Overall, it’s a great spot I’d recommend to anyone."

Quyen offered so many amenities that we did not expect such as beach towels, beach blanket, wagon, chairs, umbrella and even boogie boards. Everything went perfectly. He even gave us a small treat as we celebrated our wedding anniversary while staying. If your looking for a place to stay while in La Jolla, San Diego area this is the place! 10 minute or less walk to the beach and local restaurants. We are looking forward to booking again with Quyen."

Stayed a few nights","Michael's place is the perfect location for a short stay in San Diego. The neighbourhood is quiet and safe, there are great views, and it's a walking distance from a lot of great local spots. Michael was very friendly and had some great recommendations. The suite is private and great for one person or a couple. Although it's near the airport, the airplane sounds actually didn't bother me and didn't last long."

Stayed a few nights","This Point Loma studio was the perfect escape for my San Diego staycation. Looking for relaxation, I found it in spades. The studio itself was private and cozy, offering a tranquil atmosphere that melted away all my stress. I was so inspired by the aesthetic and loved all the interesting books and artwork in the space.
Michael was incredibly responsive throughout my stay, making sure I had everything I needed. Communication was a breeze, which is always a huge plus.
Parking was easy and a major perk, especially during a staycation when you might be coming and going frequently.
Their garden was truly a hidden gem. This unexpected delight was the absolute highlight. Still dreaming about having my morning coffee surrounded by all that greenery. The lemons I got to take home with me were the perfect memento from my stay.
Overall, this Point Loma studio exceeded my expectations. It offered a perfect blend of privacy, relaxation, and thoughtful touches."

Stayed a few nights","Michael’s place was perfectly located in Point Loma Heights, minutes away from Liberty Station and very close to the Sunset Cliffs - it was the perfect jumping off point for any of our activities in SD. Beautiful view of their garden and lovely, peaceful pathway leading to the unit. I would stay again.
Things to note: the shower is a little on the shorter side, if you’re over 5’9” you may feel a little squished in there. The airplane traffic (which is listed) could bother some but didn’t bother us, if you’re sensitive, bring earplugs because the place is worth it!"

Stayed a few nights","This suite is perfect for someone traveling alone. The bed was super comfortable and the room was beautiful. The neighborhood was very nice but hard to find parking. The first night I was there, there was a ton of noise from planes taking off nearby (something that wasn’t listed); not a deal breaker but I wish I was prepared. The listing also states it’s an ocean view but I could not see anything from the air bnb. Overall, I enjoyed my stay and would absolutely stay again! It was the perfect distance to restaurants and downtown San Diego."

On the right side is where you will enter and they have a beautiful lighted up pathway of rock stairs that leads you down to the room. Checking in is super easy with the check in code. All I have to say is Just Book it! Comfortable bed, beautiful mornings with lighting, big window with beautiful amazing view, you have access to the garden. You have great privacy too! Some things that might bother others that didn’t bother me at all, is the airplanes in the morning & there is no freezer."

Very nice view when walking the neighborhood as the home is on top of a hill. View from inside the room is nice too. Great place for a single traveler or a couple. Allows pets too. Definitely recommend as I would stay here again.

Stayed a few nights","I'm giving this place a five-star rating, but I must say that there's a lot of airplane traffic. If you're thinking of opening the windows, be aware that planes take off every 10-15 minutes. The property has double windows, which reduce the noise, but you can still hear it. Other than that, the place was great.
We had a great chat with Michael's Mexican gardener about all the vegetables he has growing there. Michael offered us anything that was ready to eat, and we highly recommend the passion fruit. Sergio told us to cut it in half and suck on the seeds. It was delicious!
Hope this helps. Safe travels! Watch our vlog: @sperryndipitytravel 🤙🏻"

Location was about 10-20 minutes to everything we wanted to see. Highly recommend checking out Liberty Public Market and catching the sunset over at Sunset Cliffs. Just a minor note that this is close to the airport so if you are a light sleeper maybe bring a white noise machine but a floor fan was provided and the windows are double-paned."

Honestly we thought there was an error with the price because of how great of a value it was. The airbnb has a very cool mid century modern vibe. It was clean and in a great/safe neighborhood. It was in close proximity to both sides of San Diego that we wanted to see. Additionally, the recommendation of Ortiz Taco Shop was a 15/10 on my husband's taco scale. If we ever visit San Diego again we would check to see if Michael's airbnb is available."

Can’t wait to return again!! Note: I could hear the airplanes overhead if you’re a light sleeper there’s a google home (Alexa) and I played white noise so it wasn’t a problem for me. I slept very well & comfy! Thanks Michael for being a superhost 🌟 and sharing your lovely space

Planes fly low overhead at regular intervals. The space is pretty well sound dampened, but it was still quite noticeable. Once I got used to it, it wasn't as big of an issue, but I felt it was something worthy of mentioning
Michael was incredibly accommodating and answered a few questions I had very quickly. Should I return to San Diego, I would definitely consider this spot again. Very close to some great restaurants, and between 20-30 minutes from a number of other popular tourist spots. Was an excellent stay!"

Although I was worried after reading some reviews about the connecting door and airplane noises, both were never a problem during my stay. (There's a blind that covers the whole door, so it felt like an independent room)
I love minimalistic rooms and plants, so Michael's place really hit the spot for me. Then there was a great view, a clean bathroom, smart TV, and a virtual assistant that made the stay even better.
There's no doubt this will be my go-to Airbnb in SD.

One downside are the doors next to the bathroom and inside the bathroom that the host could unlock and walk through. As a female solo travel it made me nervous especially when the crying coming from the tv sounded like a human.

Stayed a few nights","This Airbnb was one of my favorite parts of me and my friend’s 3-day vacation and turned out to be an air conditioned oasis since our trip fell on the week of a historic heat wave! The heat forced us to stay inside for hours at a time, which we didn’t mind at all since we got some good Netflix time on a big screen and soaking in the natural light and incredible views. It was close to everything we did (Torrey Pines State Park was the farthest at 25 minutes away, Mission Beach, Sunset Cliffs, North Park, Liberty Station just 5 minutes away!!), everything was clean, and Michael was super responsive to any questions we had. Stop looking, trust me—just book it already 😎"

It was okay. But do recommend if you don’t mind, close to everything"

On top of the benefits of having a separate entrance (with a beautifully maintained garden pathway) and being in a calm & quiet neighborhood, this accommodation was neat, clean, abundantly lit and airy, and comfortable. There is ample furniture in the space too - from a very comfortable bed to work-desks and armchairs. Michael was a great host too - always quick with communication and helpful with recommendations. Some folks might find the lack of a kitchen slightly awkward (though there is a fridge, microwave, and a coffee maker). However, we had no issues accessing food from a great range of nearby restaurants. Highly recommend staying here!"

The check-in process was easy and Michael was respectful and left me alone my entire stay. I appreciate having my own entrance and bathroom (I don’t like to disturb others with my coming and going, especially when it comes to using the bathroom). I’m 5’9” and the shower was a good size for me, but might be a little small for taller individuals. The shower head was awesome and I loved it. The mattress was too soft for me, but that is a personal preference (I got used to sleeping on firm mattresses to alleviate back aches). Overall, well worth the value for a small vacation."

I arrived much later than expected but I texted him
& he was kind enough to leave a light on for me. Just be careful navigating the stone steps that lead to the door after dark. Tedcareful navigating the steps down to the entryway doorFirst class, first rate! Would definitely stay there again."

Stayed a few nights","Cozy studio, perfect for our trip! Michael was quick to respond and very helpful!Things to be aware of:
• shower stall is indeed small and shower head is low. This wasn't a problem for us, we're both under 5'9, but it may be uncomfortable for taller guests. However, water heat and pressure was great!!
•steps down the side to access the room are rough stone, easy enough to navigate on foot, but may be tricky with rolling luggage or a stroller. Steps are lit at night!
•The room got a little chilly at night but the provided space heater made all the difference.
•Mini-fridge provided, microwave not.
The room has excellent natural light and would be great for an artist. Tons of spare linens and pillows available, and the mattress was super comfortable!
I'd definitely stay again or recommend to a friend."

Stayed a few nights","I had a wonderful time at Michael's. The location is great. You can easily walk to so many places including the beaches and Liberty Station. The neighborhood felt very safe and was quiet my entire stay. Parking on the street was very easy. You're only about a 10-15 minute drive from most attractions. If you're a single or couple always on the go this is a great place to crash. The location does have frequent airplane traffic but as someone who is sensitive to noise, I got used to it on the second day when inside. Planes fly from 6:30am-11:30pm. The shower could pose an issue for wide and tall people. Wifi is not good for video conferencing and TV connection dropped often."

The back yard is amazing. The family has a gorgeous garden with multiple beds filled with edible foods. There is even a little greenhouse. My dog was able to run around safely since the yard is fenced. It is also separate from the main house so it feels very private.
The patio in the yard includes a super nice propane fire pit to relax during the evenings. Sunsets and night views are breathtaking!
The shower is a bit small but fully stocked with everything you could need which was a plus.
A nespresso machine, mini fridge, and microwave make up the kitchenette which worked perfect by allowing my to have a morning coffee and then try out some of the lovely restaurants recommended by the host.
The area is very quiet atop the hills between Point Loma and ocean beach. This location is perfect as you are close enough to both to be very convenient. We went to the beach every day, got lunch in Point Loma, and then the freeway is still only 10 minutes away.
Thank you for an amazing stay, we will surely be back!"

It was plenty spacious for four guests and the bed were so comfortable. We used Uber most everywhere while we were there and it was centrally located about 5-10 minutes from anything you’d wanna do. There is a free parking space dedicated to the guests which was so nice to see in this area. The shower was great and the price was so worth it!
Stu was so nice the whole time and accommodated an early check in for us and even let us stash our bags there for a moment before before our flight. He alone earns this place 5 stars! Overall, this will be our only place we wanna stay for future visits 😍"

The two things that bothered me the most is that the windows and the front doors did not have curtains, which made it visible from the street at night. The other thing is that check out time is a bit earlier ( 10 o’clock) than all the other rooms I’ve been to. The overall experience was pleasant."

Stayed a few nights","Stu's place was lovely for a last-minute trip to San Diego. It's located very close to the airport and the I-5 but is tucked away from all the noise. Was very easy to get to Balboa Park and Little Italy. Highlights were the cute front balcony, very large sectional, and breakfast nook. Recommend for anyone seeking peace and quiet plus convenient access to freeway! Stu was very responsive and quickly delivered missing toilet paper and trash bags. The two things I would flag is that the home felt a little bit dusty and perhaps had remnants of pet dander/smells as I felt my mild allergies act up. As mentioned before, the parking spot is a bit tight and involves hopping half of a short curb. Street parking was not readily available in the immediate vicinity on a Friday night but was totally open on a Thursday evening."

Stu was very accomodating to let us check in early so we could get to the zoo. Stu responded to my barrage of questions on where to eat, how to get to the zoo etc. which was very nice. There was so many cute places and restarurants to visit nearby. It was so convenient to the Airport, but it did not even feel like it. It felt like we were in a small town. Again I wish we had had more time to stay here. I will definately see if this place is available if we get the opprtunity to come back."

Group trip","It was my family’s first time in San Diego and Stu’s place was very centrally located with easy access to the freeway and very close to Little Italy and many great restaurants. Stu was very responsive and helpful during our stay. If we are lucky enough to make it back out to San Diego, we will definitely stay here again."

Stayed one night","I've always booked hotels for family trips in the past, but Stu's place has made me an Airbnb convert! I can not recommend his place highly enough. You can tell he makes every effort to make his guests feel at home. The property housed the four of us very comfortably - definitely an upgrade from the two hotel rooms I was going to book!
If you're in the San Diego area, and want to stay somewhere with all the comforts of home, look no further than Stu's place. We'll be going back there for sure!"

Group trip","Stu’s place was perfect for our weekend trip. It’s on the second floor and near the airport. So if your a light sleeper that may not work for you (so keep that in mind).
The neighborhood was calm and quiet. There was a gastropub down the block and a cocktail bar a block and half away. Near the fwy. Good location.
The home had everything we needed. Towels, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, kitchen utensils and accessories (which we didn’t use, but it’s there if you need it), fridge & freezer (thank you for the ice!), & stove.
The beds were comfortable. The couch was comfortable. The location was a 10-20min drive away from everything we needed to do that weekend, UCSD graduation.
It comes with one parking spot. We had two cars and didn’t have a hard time finding parking for the second car, so parking was ok. Check in was easy and Stu was very communicative. I would consider booking Stu’s place again!"

I stay in a lot if airbnb and this is one of my top faves. I will return when going back to San Diego. Everyone had a great time and Stu was amazing as a host also. Lots of added touches and checked in with us to make sure we knew he was available for questions or needs. Everything was fully stocked and nothing additional was needed.

We highly recommend this spot for anyone looking to experience the best of San Diego's beach life. Jacqui was a super friendly and responsive host. Five stars!"

Stayed a few nights","The best Airbnb I’ve stayed at!! I’m from CA and have visited SD many times, but this trip was particularly memorable largely because of Jacqui’s beachside home. The apartment was beautifully decorated with such cozy, thoughtful details and amenities (a large king bed, plenty of towels & toiletries, as well as a Nespresso coffee machine!), in a stunning location just steps from the beach. The neighborhood itself is lovely too, the inner streets/pathway to the beach vaguely reminded me of streets in Spain, and there’s a paved walking path that stretches across Mission Beach where you can go on a walk with a gorgeous view. During the weekend we enjoyed going to Cafe Tropics for açaí bowls and there’s a Starbucks within walking distance as well fyi. Thank you Jacqui for such an amazing stay!"

Stayed a few nights","You know your vaca is great when you wish you could have stayed another day! Jacqui's place was spotless, she responded instantly with any questions we had (honestly, best ever and we have been utilizing Airbnb before it was popular!) and you can't beat the location! Nestled in between the bay and beach, you just had to step outside and decide which direction to walk; only a few steps to get to either. Everyone wants 'beachfront' but for us, we like privacy, less noise and not staring at massive crowds of people marching by and feeling like we are on display. Her block, despite being so close to the beach, was so peaceful with the smell of flowers not humanity; we walked or rode our bikes everywhere. Tons to do and so much fun! I would highly recommend staying here!"

Stayed a few nights","We stayed here for 3 nights and it was our first time staying in Misson Beach. We aren't much for the bar scene but thought this location was just enough out of the way for the night life. It was also a very easy location for the early ride to the airport.
The location was just steps away from the beach so we enjoyed early morning walks and sunset walks. It was perfect. Jaqui's place was well kept and stocked with a few unopened drinks from the previous guest. The shower has very good water pressure and super hot water, which is always a plus after long days.
The kitchen sink seemed a little clogged and I messaged Jaqui right away as a heads up and she was very responsive.
Lastly it was easy to check in and quick with a keyless entry. We were able to park our Range Rover Evoque in the garage.
I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting."

One thing for out of towners to make note of is that the place can get cold depending on if it’s cooler outside but that’s expected. The parking garage is tight so a sedan or mid size suv is all that could fit. We drove a Chevy volt.
There’s also lots to walk to near this place (coffee shops, bars, restaurants, etc). Take the boardwalk to pacific beach or Belmont park. Beautiful sunsets too! Choose your adventure!"

Stayed a few nights","Due to the recent flight delays and flooding up north our only option for our baby moon was to head south. We visited Mission Beach before but never stayed. This cute condo was my boho dreams. Had everything we needed including a king size bed for my pregnancy pillow. The location was feet away from the boardwalk, restaurants and coffee shops. It rained everyday but we made the best of it. It did get really cold inside but luckily they left a small heating fan which was super handy. The photos are exact. She was super responsive and allowed us to check in a bit early. Would recommend 10/10."

Stayed a few nights","Cozy upstairs apartment with everything needed on vacation. The location cannot be beat - unless you pay the price for beachfront - but this is as close as it gets. We parked the car in the garage when we arrived and didn't take it anywhere until we left town - we were able to get around to everything in Mission Beach by bike or walking. Real Perks = garage with opener, gas stove, toiletries provided in bathroom, beach chairs, boogie boards and umbrellas (shared by all guests in building), cute courtyard patio with lighting for sitting outside in the evening or for morning coffee. We enjoyed a few meals at Luigi's and Draft - recommend both. All in all, a great place to stay. Unfortunately we probably won't be return visitors since the pet policy has changed, but really enjoyed our stay here."

Parking around Mission Beach will test me LOL We had a fun and relaxing time and I hope to visit again soon! Best part was just getting up early morning and walking to the nearby coffee/cafe shops then walking along the beach or bay."

We visited during winter and temps in San Diego get very cold at night. Unfortunately not having heat was too cold for me personally. There were a couple things that helped (I.e. space heaters, but they have to be spaced out or the breaker will trip!). Other than that, it was great and I would consider staying again in warmer months!"

We loved our stay and did as other renters said - walked to Buzz Coffee, enjoyed the short trek to the ocean and kept our eyes out but unfortunately didn’t catch a view of the golden retriever neighbor pup. Our only warning: beware of just how compact that garage spot is! Like the posting says, it’s not for larger cars but even our rental compact vehicle was a tight squeeze. We LOVED having on-site parking but it definitely took a few attempts to get in with the other cars parked in the alley. Overall, great Airbnb!"

The condo is clean and looks just like the photos. We didn't cook there but the kitchen was fully equipped.
The bed was cloud-like comfortable and we slept well. We were able to sign into our streaming apps with out issue. I worked everyday and wifi was nice and strong.
Jacqui was also sweet enough to drop off a couple of things that I requested like a space heater.
Jaqui and her family are so sweet. Highly recommend!!"

Only drawbacks-
My travel partner and myself weren’t there much during the daytime, but there is construction next door and they do start at 7am. Was mildly annoying in the morning (more so on Saturdays). Beds were some form of memory foam, but neither myself or my travel partner found them comfortable."

The 2 story townhouse was perfect with the 2 bedrooms and main bathroom upstairs. The kitchen has new quality appliances, plenty of cook and dishware, microwave, coffee maker, and toaster oven. In this kitchen remodel no detail was left undone even down to the gorgeous backsplash. The living room has a huge smart HDTV. There is a half bath off of the living room with a stackable washer and dryer very tastefully done. After sightseeing all day the absolute best part of returning to this beautiful home was having not one, but two dedicated parking places. Everything was just wonderful with my rental and when I return in the fall, I will be renting again. Edward was very easy to work with and always quick to respond."

Also having a dishwasher and a massive laundry machine makes life so much easier especially in San Diego which seems like a rare amenity.
The host was very kind and brought us pastries on two Sundays which was a nice treat.
A minor thing is there was construction next door and some times they start hammering at 7am which was annoying but I understand that's out of their control.
All in all, a great place to stay at when you compare everything else that's available nearby.
I would totally recommend my friends stay at this house in the future."

The airbnb had everything you would need for a weekend stay; a fridge, a microwave, plates cups, silverware, a clothing iron, plenty of paper towels, and a nice roku tv for late night binges (if you wanna do that lol). Overall extremely cozy very relaxing. Would recommend. Thanks Antonio."

I appreciate how clean it was and considering it’s near lots of trees I only saw 1 ant and 1 little spider. They really keep the insects out. My only thing was that the bed wasn’t as comfortable as I would like if you’re over 40 years old like me. Younger people may not have a problem with that. This was a great place to stay and you will enjoy it. The shower made you feel like you were in another country, it was AMAZING!"

Stayed one night","I found Antonio’s Airbnb and was drawn to the photos and the great deal. I quickly booked, and Antonio was responsive accommodating. My request for an added package. Instructions were provided upon arrival with step-by-step video instructions on how to access and utilize all the amenities, which was convenient, I believe that the location provided rustic charm cabin fill and fit the description. I know some of the other reviews mentioned the size of the bedding, which is a tight squeeze. If you have a larger frame, however due to the size of the room itself the full size is what makes sense so expect that. All the expected amenities were there the kitchenette, coffee maker, wine glasses, iron, which is convenient. I also appreciate the fact that they had a shower caddy so you don’t have to put your loofah or soaps on the floor of the shower. Some people may not care about this, but I do appreciate the fact that they use the good quality, thick, ply, toilet paper."

Easy parking was a relief! We were able to park right on the street by the house. I also appreciated that the host had an extension cord right by each bedside so you didn’t have to go searching for it. That was a simple but very nice touch!
I also enjoyed the outdoor area above the airbnb with beautiful views of the city. Just to note it isn’t private and is right in front of the main house. Which doesn’t take away from the view just know that part isn’t secluded from the main home like the airbnb is.
Overall wonderful and would highly recommend"

Stayed one night","The guest house is an intimate space tucked away on a hill in beautiful La Mesa. We opted for the “I’m in the mood” amenity and added a floral arrangement. We were supplied with a candlelit (electric candles), romantic music, cobblestone room covered in decorative rose petals and with an electric fireplace (super cute).
One bottle of champagne, 4 delicious cupcakes and 2 water bottles were in the mini fridge (there is a small freezer section in the fridge)
There was a coffee machine, microwave and toaster.
The room had 2 sinks with running water (kitchenette and bathroom).
The bathroom is sectioned off with a barn style door. The shower was lovely and had both natural and electric lighting. The entire place was incredibly tidy.
Bathroom had 2 full size towels and 4-6 hand towels.
The A/C worked beautifully (we set it to 68 degrees)
The hot water was not working but it was resolved within 15 minutes after contacting the host.
There is also a binder of things to do!
10/10 would return"

It is located right next to the La Mesa stairs, which was a fun outing. It is super private. It has a beautiful view. The host was very responsive. He had detailed instructions on YouTube, which I have never been provided before from a host. It was such a romantic spot. The extra packages offered made the staycation even that much more romantic and enjoyable. I added on the romance package and walked into the room with music playing on Spotify that set the tone for the evening. I couldn’t have been happier with my experience here.

I wished I could have stayed longer but my trip into town was only for a day. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for something picturesque, the downtown La Mesa area is a nice little place to grab food or look around at different shops.

The owner was very attentive and quickly responded when we couldn’t figure out the door lock. He sent very clear instructions within minutes.
We are heavy sleepers so this wasn’t a deal breaker for us, but it is a bit nosey. It is close to a main street so we tended to hear a lot of sirens passing by throughout the stay.
Very nice neighborhood that felt safe! Beautiful view!!!"

Stayed one night","Perfect spot for couples to get away,
This neighborhood offers some good hiking if you enjoy hills and stairs or possibly a stroll to a local restaurant. We are an active couple so it was a added bonus.
The house is very unique. The round house is on the property of an additional house, it was an original pottery studio for the main home. However, I did not see the owners except in the morning when they left.
The only downside to this home is it quite noisy at night, a-lot of traffic, sirens, and the trolley can be heard. I would bring ear plugs in there future to ensure a restful snooze, but would stay again. Don’t let it deter you from the experience. It is worth it. Very romantic spot."

Stayed a few nights","We had a wonderful stay at the round house! Antonio John made it so easy for us to find the Airbnb, including step by step directions using a YouTube link for our convenience. When we got there, it was dark, so we appreciated knowing exactly where we were going!
We were grateful for the other videos we could have access to ahead of time, such as the ones with directions about lights, shower, sink, and rooftop access. When we arrived, we felt like we had already familiarized ourselves with the house and we didn’t have to guess. That being said, we knew the video folder was private and secure. Antonio John really makes things crystal clear for guests!
As guests, we didn’t indulge in any of the packages offered, mostly because we were spending Thanksgiving with family, but we did feel that Antonio John went above and beyond in offering extra amenities."

The windows were filthy and as much as I wanted to keep the blinds open you could barley see outside cause of the dirt on the glass. There was a lot a bit of small things inside of the cottage like a dead plant that made it feel a bit dirty but nothing too bad. Beside that the place was perfect and would still recommend for anyone staying in the area!

Before arriving Antonio(host) spared no time in letting us know where to park safely. Getting on-site is no problem, just follow his instructions and everything will run smooth. I asked for 2 packages from his bundle of choices. All of which were executed perfectly. I highly recommend adding a package if the occasion calls for it or if you have a sweet tooth. Upon entering everything was beautifully set up and easily accessible. I would recommend bringing your own body soap but other then that the place was awesome! Lots of food and bar choices nearby as well as plenty of shopping spots. Antonio(host) recommends plenty of good choices ranging from historical sites, restaurants, drinking spots and plenty more. Highly recommend a stay here!"

The views from on top of the roof and from inside looking out the window at night and sunset/ sunrise are so pretty. My girlfriend and I stayed here for our anniversary and I did the extra “in the mood” package for her and that was definitely worth it as well. Great place to stay for couples but also would be really peaceful and fun to stay alone or with friends.
Parking is so convenient here. They literally let you use their driveway.
Literally my favorite Airbnb I have ever stayed in! Book it!!!"

All-in-all it’s a nice place to stay for a weekend trip. The place is small with no stove top, so not ideal for long stays. Also, the host did a good job on providing videos explaining FAQs, such as where to park and how to unlock the door."

The shower did not provide enough hot water. There was a previous review about privacy and I have to agree. It is on the same property as another house and didn’t feel as comfortable as we have in other airbnbs. Other than that it was fine but I think it’s worth maybe half of what we paid.

it seem. The cottage is located on a property with apartments, very limited privacy. People and a dog walked across the top of the cottage during our stay which was very loud inside the cottage. We stayed in June and the A/C did not keep the unit cool, Antonio did bring us a fan but it wasn’t enough during daytime. Once checked in Antonio did reply quickly to texts, but I reached out a few times prior to our stay and he didn’t reply. Also he sent the lock box code after the 4:00 check-in. Place was not clean and there was a broken frig right outside our front door. Big disappointment and not worth the expense. Would not recommend!"
