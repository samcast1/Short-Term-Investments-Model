Big yard, shelter for boat, private location outside of the city… but minutes from the boat ramp. Definitely recommend!"

Group trip","Although we had a little hiccup in the beginning everything turned out great. Lee Ann’s place was perfect for our group of six. The beds were especially comfortable and the home was not far from downtown. Most importantly, the photos were an exact representation of her home and when talking to Lee Ann she was extremely friendly and helpful.
Even with the hiccup, I would stay there again and recommend this spot to my friends and family.

Lee Ann provide us with a welcome bag, clear instructions and suggested restaurants. Located about 3 miles out from the nearest town, this place was perfect. A beautiful big backyard, plenty of room in the house, board games and a study room; my family truly had a blast. Thank you Lee Ann for all the updates, I look forward to re-booking with you in the near future!"

Group trip","Lee Ann’s house is decorated tastefully and has everything to make you feel right at home. The beds are SUPER comfy and the work space was a perfect area that could be closed off from the rest of the house so you’re not disturbed. We were in town for a fishing tournament on Lake Seminole and this house is only about 10 min from the boat ramp and the same to downtown.
Lee Ann also left very thoughtful gifts at check in…a goodie bag with some necessities and sweets, makeup remover in the bathrooms, etc.
Great host and great house. 10/10 would recommend."

Group trip","I highly recommend LeeAnn's Airbnb. It was perfect for me and my family as we gathered for Thanksgiving. perfect location very peaceful quiet out in the country. She has a beautiful home and was very responsive and even left a goodie bag which was perfect. We took a recommendations and went to a nearby restaurant for lunch with me and my family. The beds were very comfortable and the house was spacious enough room for us and we even got to cook breakfast. It was just like being at home. Everything that we needed was there and we love the swing. On Saturday we sat out all day Enjoy the weather and took lots of pictures. Lastly, I was able to catch up on much needed rest. again I highly recommend Leanne's Airbnb The price was just right, the location was perfect and everything was so nice and beautiful. God bless you Lee Anne and hope to see you again next year."

Stayed with kids",We arrived at night and had difficulty finding the house. Entry is from the rear which was not lighted. The keycode lock was difficult to operate but Michele was very responsive with assistance. The house was convenient to town and restaurants and shopping but there are no sidewalks so not walkable. The location was two houses from a major intersection and on a main road and we were able to hear a lot of road noise. The house was immaculate and minimally furnished. One of the bedrooms did not have a nightstand or lamp and in another the bed was against the wall and difficult to access for two people. The mattresses were on the soft side for our particular liking. We did run out of toilet paper and garbage bags and could not find any extra in the house but did not bother Michele with this. There are two tvs but we could not access regular tv channels. There are brick steps and walkway to enter the house and these are uneven and slippery in the rain.

Everything was super comfortable and everyone had their own space (family of 5).
A great pizza restaurant was less than a mile away and lots of other places to eat, shop as well. We will definitely be looking to stay here next time we’re down south for an FSU game!!"

Stayed a few nights","We visited Bainbridge for a memorial service, a somber occasion that made the warm energy of Bainbridge Beauty all the more precious to us. From the moment we arrived, the property offered a sanctuary of peace and comfort.
Location is everything, and here, you’re perfectly situated in a tranquil area yet accessible to local spots. Cleanliness was impeccable, setting a welcoming atmosphere from the get-go. Check-in was effortless, guided by comprehensive instructions provided in advance.
The comfortable king-sized bed was a haven for restful sleep, and the fully stocked kitchen met nearly all our culinary needs, missing only wine glasses. But the true gem was the sunroom—its stunning views and abundant natural light served as a soothing backdrop for reflection during our stay.
Overlooking this spot would be a missed opportunity of the highest order; your soul will haunt you for bypassing such an experience."

Stayed with a pet","This place is full of family history and it’s probably as close to its original state as it can be; well taken care of. The screened in porch was a family favorite! Neighbors are also nice and full of knowledge about the area. The house has plenty of room for families.
The only downfall for us wasn’t about the house but fishing from the dock was not successful at all in our 6night stay; which was the main reason for booking a lakefront property. Locals say a boat is needed for good fishing. I think we missed the spawning as this is the area gosh come to spawn March-April (we found out later).
We did enjoy early mornings watching the wildlife; geese, ducks, gators, herons, squirrels, and cardinals. This is such a peaceful area and we will be back…with a boat!
There is a marina right around the corner if you do bring a boat!
We only ate out once during our stay&can 100% recommend Bonnie Blue House in Bainbridge!
Meat House for your meats, their smoked pork chops are delicious!"

Stayed with a pet","Great place to stay as a bass fisherman. The home is cozy and exactly as it is listed. We absolutely loved the large dock space, twin porch swings (screened in to keep those bugs out) and the cleanliness inside and out. A couple things we found to be a little unfortunate were the lack of cupboard space due to how much unnecessary kitchenware etc is stored. Not really an issue for a short term stay but it was a struggle for us when staying about a month to find places to store our food other than on the counter. The only other issue was the size of the covered bays on the dock. There are two covered bays to park a boat both with working lifts which is great however they are too small to fit mostly any bass boat. We have a 2019 triton 20’ and it only got about 1/3 of the way under before being stuck in between the sides of the dock. This is not a deal breaker by any means as you can still park alongside the dock perfectly fine just uncovered. Overall very nice place and will return."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I took my mom and little sister to the lake for Mothers day weekend and stayed in Williams house on the cove. We couldn't have asked for a more perfect place to stay. The home was big enough and had enough room where each one had our own space and bathroom, it was quiet and private, had a beautiful dock for fishing, was right around the corner from a boat ramp to launch the boat and was stocked with everything we could have needed from plenty of linens to any thing you might need to cook in the kitchen... We enjoyed the swings on the screened in back porch and the rocking chairs on the dock with a beautiful view of the peaceful little cove.... We visited the antique shops and a couple of parks in Bainbridge, cooked dinner on the charcoal grill that was provided, and fished from the dock when he wasn't out on the lake in the boat. It was a very peaceful and relaxing time at the lake and my mom loved it, and communication with William was great. He is even mailing my husbands fishing hat to us that he forgot.. I can't say enough about how perfect this place was for our needs for a weekend get away and how much we appreciate William allowing us the use of his beautiful home... We hope to return again one day...."

And three bathrooms helped, LOL. Firepit on Friday night just when the cold front came in was so much fun! Fully equipped kitchen (might take out a few of the colanders & put in another larger cast iron skillet :) If we needed anything all we had to do was look around and we found it.
Was reassuring when William called me the night before to see if we needed anything. Highly recommend!!!! Would be excellent choice for a fishing weekend or week!! We caught a couple off the dock, but this one was all about the wedding."

Stayed a few nights","We had a great time at the Cove. It was very comfortable and peaceful. The house is well stocked and had more than enough room for our party of six. William is a great host and responded to all questions in under 2 minutes. The yard was cut the day of arrival and the house was spotless. Plenty of room to park vehicles and trailers. We really enjoyed fishing off your dock and watching the alligators and turtles. Lots of chairs available to relax. We caught bass, bluegill, crappie, channel catfish, gar and a shad right off the large dock. Having the opportunity to use two boat lifts is above and beyond. Access to the big water is only a couple minutes away by boat. Mac's Point boat launch and restaurant is right around the corner. Great food! Lots of weed in September, but the fishing is good. I saw a couple of huge bass, but they weren't interested in my offering. To many bluegill around for them to snack on. Highly recommend staying at the Cove if your looking to relax in a peaceful neighborhood and enjoying Lake Seminole."

Stayed with kids","Doug's place was as described, and more! Even with neighbors, it's peacefully quiet. It isn't a huge house, but so spacious. Our group of 12 didn't feel crowded at all, & enjoyed watching a family movie in the evening or playing various games Doug has available. We were in the area to visit family, but they wound up not being available last minute. So we enjoyed fishing from the dock & feeding the ducks, playing all kinds of games on hand in the house, and taking drives to visit local state parks & scenic drives. I can't say enough about our stay. As far as vacations rentals go, Doug has more incidentals from the get go that usually aren't there. We only had to make one store run.
Doug was very communicative with any issues, concerns, or questions. He was preemptive with clear & detailed check-in instructions.
The house itself is very neat, clean, spacious, & comfortable. All of the beds were comfortable, and despite being there for a chilly dip in the weather, we were warm & comfy."

Stayed a few nights","Location was perfect being close to downtown, as well as less than a 5 min drive to Walmart and other places to eat. Very unique place to stay. Decorated well and had an old charm to it. Bathrooms were clean and great. I’d recommend sleeping downstairs for a bit softer sleep and upstairs for a more firm sleep. Kitchen had mostly what you would need to cook basic meals. While the living room furniture matches the style of the cottage, it isn’t very comfortable to sit on for longer periods. Especially, if you were planning to spend a length of time to watch a movie. The Host was very helpful and seems to care very much about making your stay a good one. Cleaning fee seems a bit steep at $150 given the amount of prep cleaning you are requested to do before checking out. Would recommend as a place to stay in Bainbridge for a private getaway."

Plenty of towels, really nice walk in showers. All of the appliances appeared brand new: Refrigerator, Range, washer and dryer, microwave. The lighting is perfect for each room and really accentuates the ambience whether it’s a bedroom, bathroom, den or dining room. The finished interior walls add to the charm. There is an amazing porch area in the back that is air conditioned. Great for coffee in the mornings. The front porch was well lit and the front porch swing was calling my name.
This was an excellent choice and I will definitely stay again.
Thanks Natalie"

Stayed with kids","This place REALLY is a former Jewish Synagogue. Everything about it is cool. The space that was once a large rectangular worship space with beautiful stamped tin ceilings is now a 2 bedroom AirB&B. The new owners closed in 2 corners, creating a bedroom and bath in each corner. a kitchen with a beautiful timber countertop takes up one side and a living area takes up the other side - - with a huge open area in the middle that our 7 month old cruised around in his walker. The raised pulpit area now has a dining table with pipe organ pipes serving as a backdrop. The Torah cabinet is still there (empty now). Such a grand idea! Hats off to the city of Brunswick for relaxing CRAZY modern building codes and allowing this 3 dimensional work of art 👍"

The windows are stunning, and use of space is quiet clever. There is a kcup coffee maker and the kitchen is very well equipped. Wish I could have moved in!
Parking is onstreet unfortunately. Also some of the construction isn’t quite done. Didn’t bother us since we are DIYers but something to be aware of.
There is an amazing restaurant and brewery within walking distance. Plan to spend some time in the park in time square. So perfect you feel like you have walked into a movie. And the gazebo even has some outdoor games you can play.
Definitely will be back!"

Stayed with a pet","Mark was a wonderful host. He was very understanding and accommodating, as we needed a place to stay due to last minute mandatory evacuation from our home in Florida. He personally welcomed our family to one of the most unique Airbnbs we’ve stayed at.
The newly renovated home was breath taking from the moment we walked in. It was spacious and beautifully decorated, with lots of attention to detail, including many original items from the former synagogue. The original organ pipes and stunning chandelier were the centerpieces of this space. This is one of those places that have to be experienced to really appreciate its beauty.
Each room had very comfortable beds, clean, soft bedding, and cozy sitting areas.
Kitchen and bathrooms were also spotless.
It is located within a 5 min walk to downtown area to shops, cafes and restaurants. Mark was very kind and treated us to delicious donuts from The Donut Shop. We feel honored to have been his first guests, and highly recommend a stay here"

The reason we can only give three stars is that when we arrived around 10pm, the water to the house was off. America was very quick to respond, provide as much assistance as she could, and make sure the water got turned on the next morning. Once we got past the first water-less night, we had a good experience staying at Service."

Plenty of driveway space (loved the half-circle driveway). The beds were very comfortable; it was nice after a long day working to come home and relax in bed while watching the large-screen televisions that were in two of the bedrooms (plus one in the living room).

1. It was exactly as pictured. Such a cute place and we loved the attention to detail even in the small decor.
2. We loved learning about the history of the house. Natalie had a book that showed the home’s journey from the beginning. It makes the stay feel extra special!
3. Travel crib was CLUTCH. I forgot to bring sheets for it and was really hoping she would have some. She did! As well as a baby blanket. As a first time mom, I really appreciated that.
4. Neighborhood is quiet. The mornings with the light flowing in the front windows was dreamy.
5. SUCH A COMFORTABLE BED! The accent chair in living room is also SO COMFY.
6. The fridge was so cool. Couldn’t believe it actually worked!
7. There are postcards of the house with stamps included to be able to send out. Love that!
8. The host is super kind. Very responsive. You can tell she LOVES this project of hers and takes pride in the listing.
We will be coming back!🤍 Thank you!!"

We rented the house for my daughter’s wedding weekend so that she could get ready in the house and it made for the perfect backdrop for all the getting ready wedding pictures!! The front porch and side patio are so charming and inviting. The location is perfect, so close to everything downtown Bainbridge has to offer!!"

She was extremely easy to communicate with - and even facilitated the use of a piece of medical equipment that could be used to make our stay a bit easier.
The little house was clean, accommodating - and just blocks from Bainbridge Square where we enjoyed several meals along with some window shopping.
The front porch is a little slice of heaven. We took advantage of the beautiful sunshine and the built-in porch swing!
We highly recommend staying at The Little House on Broughton St."

I was expecting this adorable and immaculate shotgun to have a small bathroom; but boy was I wrong-- it's a glorious, light-filled, spa-like room with beautiful blue and white tile and a claw-foot tub like grandma's. The house is a quick, easy walk to the many charms of historic Bainbridge, a great spot for those heading south to the Panhandle and beyond. Natalie is a wonderful host who LOVES to promote her town. Need anything? Just ask! A+++"

The tub is my favorite and I love the charm of the whole house. Bed is very comfortable. The historic square that’s within walking distance has some nice shops, several great restaurants, a brewery, coffee shops, a bakery and an ice cream shop - plus space for little ones to run off some energy. So great to see the historical homes in the area being renovated!Check in was easy, as was check out.

We drank wine on the front porch swing and watched the sun go down. We loved the little welcome books that were provided to give an overview of the house and Bainbridge. Downtown is just a little walk down the street. It was a perfect weekend getaway. We honesty would have never thought to visit Bainbridge, but saw this on Airbnb and had to check it out. You’re an excellent ambassador to Bainbridge, and we can’t wait to visit again!"

Stayed a few nights","The Little House on Broughton Street is just the sweetest Air BnB! Bainbridge is an old southern town with a real town square that is being revitalized and this little country shotgun style house is a few minutes walk from the town square. Natalie is a dream hostess —who lives close by—- and she has thought of everything for the safety and comfort of her guests. Directions to get in and get out are clear and easy to understand. The house itself is perfect with an antique bed covered in crisp white cotton sheets, fluffy pillows and antique furniture. The bathroom has an adorable claw foot tub (painted pale haint blue on the outside and trimmed out with special claw feet) and finished off with lovely soft towels. The doors are all sunflower yellow. Everything is sparkling clean!!! The front porch is outfitted with an old fashioned porch swing and on the side yard there is a little patio complemented by Edison string lights hanging from a magnolia tree dripping with Spanish moss. It was the most perfect place to stay, eat, and shop.

Just a note for future vacationers that the location does not have a microwave if you intend to bring meals to heat up, just prepare ahead. There is a very neat two eyed table-top stove with crockpot and air-fryer type oven though, along with many other cooking needs!

Stayed a few nights",We enjoyed staying in this AirBnB in Bainbridge. The house was in a nice neighborhood which was walking distance from the town square and restaurants. It was spotlessly clean and comfortable. Communication with the owner was outstanding. We initially had challenges with the WiFi but Banks was very responsive in fixing that problem so the issue was quickly resolved. You won’t be disappointed if you stay here.

Stayed with kids","Firstly, we would stay here again, which I think speaks volumes about the worth of a house/home. Debra is an amazingly thoughtful and thorough host, who anticipated our needs and even asked for our opinion about how to improve the property. And the house was IMMACULATELY clean. She truly went above and beyond!
We didn’t spend much time in the house, since we only came for ~24 hours, but it had all of the standard tech amenities like TV and WiFi. Beds were very comfortable to sleep in, and living room furniture was also nice for sitting!
I would like to point out that there isn’t a stove, which isn’t likely to be a deal-breaker for anyone, but it made boiling water for our baby’s formula difficult, since we had to do it in the microwave a little at a time.
Secondly, there are some windows and doors which are not covered by curtains or shades (and there are some blinds that don’t quite block out light nor the ability of outsiders to look in), all of which was a little disconcerting given that there is some foot traffic on a sidewalk in front of the house. I feel certain, though, that Debra will probably take care of that before the next family arrives!
But again, the house was a great place to stay, and Debra is THE reason we will return, if we have a chance in the future. Debra, thank you so much for your hospitality!"

Stayed a few nights","Our anniversary trip to Desta’s Boathouse was JUST what the doctor ordered!!! This momma and daddy of four LOVE to spend our little getaways at exotic places. One year we drove to key west in a convertible. The older our kids get…and the older they make US…the less we want to spend our time away constantly moving. We arrived without any problems, unloaded at the boathouse. The next door neighbor was incredibly friendly and suggested we try Bonnie Blue House for dinner. Get the Redfish!! We spent the whole next day, fishing off the porch (I caught a 12 pound catfish 😊, hubs caught a few too…mine was bigger) and just relaxing. We explored the park across the river, it was so beautiful! This was the most relaxing trip we have ever taken. The quietness of the marina was something we both needed desperately!! We met some geese, and a few alligators, it was a wonderful vacation and we can not wait until next year! This will be our new anniversary tradition!"

Stayed a few nights","I stayed for 2 nights with my husband for a relaxing vacation for my birthday in November. This little boathouse is so cute and relaxing. It is nicely decorated has everyting you need and more. Thre is coffee tea, condaments, games, plenty of exra blankets, and space heaters and airconditioners to supplement the the centeral air/heat unit. The master bed is soft and comfy, but if you don't like being wakened by the sun in the morning, bring a sleep mask. I made due by tieing a scarf arond my eyes after being awakened early the fist morning. There is a window near the cealing without a curtin and the curtain on the sliding glass door lets in alot of light. The bunk room is darker with one small window with wood blinds. The bottom bunk is very firm. The living room is very comfortable, there is cable TV, but I don't like TV. I connected my roku but the wifi signal was to week to stream on roku. But I was happy streaming on my phone using my data. Next time I will bring a cable to connect my phone to the TV. I spent most my time on the back porch doing embordiey and watching the ducks, fish jumping, and boats passing by. The space heaters and extra blakents came in handy on the back porch in the chilly November mornings and nighs. We did not leave, as I read there us not much to do in town but a couple of parks. I have chronic fatigue and pain, so I was satisified just staying at the boathouse. The houseboat is somewhat accesiable for people with mobility issues. There are no steps leading to the boat house. I had no problems geting there with my power wheelchair. The is one big step down from the dock to the boathouse entrance about 1 ft. I used my 4ft long ramp and cane to get down the step. I did not feel safe with my heavy power wheelchair on the ramp. Although a lightweight wheelchair or walker would probaly be fine on a ramp. However the doorways are much to small for any wheelchair or walker, you can only use a cane. There are no steps inside the boathouse and a very low threshold for the shower, about 4in. I would recomend this place to anyone looking for a relaxing vacation."

It is so peaceful and relaxing and the screen porch that sits directly over the water is heaven! We had coffee in the morning, simple lunches, chilled in the afternoon, read books & magazines, played cards and ended the day with a good dinner and lots of wine! Desta is an awesome host and she has made sure that everything you need is right there on the boathouse! She is extremely responsive and accommodating! All you have to do is pack some comfy clothes and stop by the grocery store and then you're all set for a fabulous, relaxing stay!"

The bunk room is the cutest! Open living with relaxing screened porch on the water. Expect cracks in the tile floor due to movement of the home on the water. Hime do not move a lot just sme movement from waves that come off the river. Clean and exactly as pictured. You will need to creative on where to put your clothes. Plenty of hanging space no dressers. Loved the USB charging ports in the kitchen!

Stayed with kids","During this pandemic, my family and I opted to avoid staying in hotels when possible and Desta's Boathouse in Bainbridge was perfect for that while we were in town for a weekend. The listing was clean and tidy upon our arrival and offered all of the basics you'd expect. Bedrooms are small but cozy and the additional half bath is a great advantage when visiting with a family. If you happen visit during the hotter months, definitely utilize the additional AC units that are provided as the Central AC does need some initial help when outside temperatures are hovering around 100 degrees.
In a city where listings on Airbnb are already incredibly sparse, The Boathouse offers a cozy space where you have the whole home to yourself while enjoying a scenic space just off the Flint River."

We ate in downtown Bainbridge at The American. (You should get the steak!). The houseboat was clean and well stocked. I’m guessing the several broken floor tiles are from slight movement being on the water? We had always wanted to try a stay on a houseboat, and now we can say we did! I would recommend."

Stayed with kids","Totally EXCELLENT not-so-tiny house on water!!! Spacious, well-appointed, Uno and Yahtzee in the closet, 2 (TWO!) bathrooms on either side of the shower room, comfy master bed and super-cool bunk beds, 2 TVs, enclosed back porch right on the water, and open porch on opposite side. Lots of cleaning supplies—-yay! Close to everything in town (quick drive). Lots of towels and toilet paper (so appreciated bc I have 2 kids!), ACs cooled entire house beautifully, and there were even popsicles and cans of water in the fridge—-very thoughtful! I could smell a grey-water-type smell in the bathrooms when running the shower and for some time afterward, but my kids didn’t smell it...and I did become nose blind to it after a few hours. I recommend to other visitors that keeping the 2 bathroom doors closed to contain the heat of the dehumidifier in the 2nd bathroom seems to help the ACs to not work too hard. I booked this houseboat bc I mistakenly thought we could swim off it—lol—but as the kids were changing into swimsuits I spotted a gator about 10 feet from the back porch...so I don’t recommend that, but still loved this houseboat and recommend it!"

There is a really nice city park within 2 miles that has great amenities that include a 3.4 mile walking trail and boat launch. Downtown Bainbridge has some really great architecture and the local shop owners are extremely friendly. The square downtown has several different types of shops and restaurants as well as a local brewery. You cannot go wrong with Desta’s place if you are looking for a nice quiet relaxing get away!"

The marina is so peaceful, except for the occasional puppy dog or the adorable geese who love to check you out on the porch!! My only downside was the area...don't expect to do too much in the Bainbridge neighborhood! 😂"

Stayed over a week","I visited under the worst possible circumstances you could imagine. I was in the area to teach a 2 week hazmat class for a local industrial plant. My stay was during the time the Flint River was flooding and coincided with the nationwide coronavirus outbreak. The marina docks were essentially made an island by the flood waters with no walkway access to them. Our hosts informed me of this in advance & offered a refund to stay elsewhere. I declined the refund & they rigged up a Jon boat ferry system from the shore to the dock. I’m glad I stuck with them because the boathouse is amazing. It is Wonderfully decorated, had Comfortable furniture & all comforts of home. It’s truly a place you could picture yourself living full time, or at least as a vacation home. Unfortunately, my stay was cut short a week by the corona virus outbreak just as the flood waters were receding. When I informed Travis & Desta of the situation, they offered to block out a week for me when the class is rescheduled. With luck, the next trip won’t involve flood waters and a national emergency. Either way, my experience was great & an adventure to say the least. It may have even turned Bainbridge into a vacation destination. Final note: Stay here. You’ll love it!!"

My daughter-in-law found Mark’s place and thought it would be perfect. As soon as the men heard “home on the river” they were all in!
We arrived and the home was just how it it is described in the post. It had everything we needed for the weekend and plenty of room to relax or have fun. We were all thrilled to see the beauty of River and listen to wildlife calling from the other bank.
Our weekend was busy with wedding events, but the men were able to squeeze in a little time for fishing. Also, my 4 year old grandson was able to see his first catfish up close. Some of our avid fisherman have already decided they would like to return so they can spend all day on the river.
This is a wonderful place that I would recommend to anyone who asks."

I requested a lot of things that were out of the ordinary and he seemed more than happy to oblige. We will definitely be returning to stay with Mark at the best Airbnb I’ve ever been to! Which is saying a lot, we travel and utilize Airbnb often. Thanks so much for everything Mark!"

Stayed a few nights","We had the best getaway! Mark’s home was everything we needed! The house was spacious & clean & so peaceful! Mark was the most wonderful host! Mark gave us a bunch of suggestions for daytime activities (we went hiking at Providence Canyon just under 2 hours away—very cool!) & he gave us the best restaurant recommendation for my husband’s birthday (The American, which was 5 min from his house & was absolutely incredible!) Mark took us on an awesome sunset river cruise, and was able to get us some insanely delicious steaks to grill one night. The view of the river from Mark’s back deck was beautiful! Homemade pancakes & coffee on that deck was absolute perfection! This escape was exactly what my husband & I needed! No work, no kids, peace & quiet, and pure relaxation! What a wonderful place to re-charge! We can’t wait to come back!!! Thanks again!"

Stayed with kids","Mark was a great host. Very welcoming and kind. Even the neighbors and their dogs came over to say hello! He also took us on his boat to try wake boarding and let the boys use the kayaks.
Mark and his family were always on the property or available by text if we needed anything.
I was hesitant at first to stay an Airbnb where it’s the host’s primary resident. I’ve stayed in many Airbnbs all over the world and that was a first. It was awkward seeing so many of their personal items, but we eventually relaxed and made ourselves at home. There were 7 of us and we had plenty of room.
We were in town for a fishing tournament and had our boat. The circular drive around the home was perfect for the boat. It was easy in/out.
Gnats are bad in Georgia this time of year, so we couldn’t sit outside much, but the view was great!
We were able to use the WiFi downstairs and it worked best in the living room. We didn’t have much service upstairs. We had to work, so WiFi was necessary!
Easy check in/out"

Mark took us out on a boat ride, taught us the basics on fishing and even chopped some wood so we could roast marshmallows with the kids. We had the perfect weekend."

Mark was quick to respond and provided all that we asked! His home reflects the love he has for the outdoors. It is appointed with many hunting gems and has a rustic cabin feel to it. Very close to town and to the venue we needed! Love the barn doors!!!"

Group trip","Mark is a great host - responsive, friendly, honest and kind. He provided his personal home to us which was ideal for our three couples meeting from various parts of the country to visit and do some fishing on Lake Seminole (4 bedrooms, 3 1/2 bathrooms and a large den with plenty of comfortable furniture). His property description is accurate. Also, Pond House Restaurant was excellent."

We had a wonderful week with a lot of time spent outside and fun times at night around the fire. Great, clean accommodations! Exactly what we needed. Within 15 minutes of all of our places we needed to be! Thank you!"

Stayed with kids",We had a great time at the River House. The view was amazing and Mark the host went out of his way to accommodate us as well as Barbecuing us a meal. We were there for our sons FLW Tour fishing event. And we had 3 Pros staying at his house. There was plenty of room for the 3 trucks and boats as well as all of our cars and trucks with room to spare. Any fishermen if you have a group that travels together you can circle the house on the drive with 4 or 5 boats and trucks so don’t hesitate to book this house.

Mark and Jenny's house was perfect for us as we had ample amount of space with their wrap around driveway, which made parking a breeze! There was plenty of space inside, as well as some great views from the back porch of the River. Mark was always there when we needed something and was a great host!"

The back yard is right on the river and Mark was generous enough to let us use the kayaks to go paddle around and fish. We did catch some fish right off the dock! Highly recommended. I definitely will be staying here again if Im ever in the area."
