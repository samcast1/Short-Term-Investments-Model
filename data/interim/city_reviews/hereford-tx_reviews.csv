Stayed with kids",Amazing stay! Very clean location. The host thought of every amenity to make your stay comfortable. It exceeded our expectations. This is the best airbnb we have stayed at in Canyon. We wish we would have stayed another night. Neighborhood is very quiet and safe. I will definitely be booking with Brandy again and checking out her other listings!

Stayed one night","Brandy's place was just what we needed for a pit stop on our way from Denver to Austin for the eclipse. We came in late at night and it was easy to find the place, and easy to let ourselves in. The beds were comfortable and everything was clean. We left early the next morning, and accidentally left behind an electric toothbrush. Brandy was quick to communicate to let us know they had found it and offered to ship it back to us. We would definitely stay here again on a future road trip!"

I have stayed in so many airbnbs that are misleading or just not that thought out by host. This is one of the most thoroughly set up and thought out airbnbs I’ve experienced.
Reminds me when Airbnb first started and I was traveling for work. You truly experienced mindful host - would recommend and come back over and over

Beds were fairly comfortable, and we appreciated having 3 beds available.
The 2 smaller beds are in pretty tiny rooms, but it was just what we needed for a quick overnight stay.

I honestly felt the pictures did not do it justice, as the decorative atmosphere is nicer in person than in the advertised pictures. Location is perfectly ideal to everything! We were able to go to Palo Dura Canyon during the day and Amarillo in the evening. The little town of Canyon was cute too, and the host had plenty of suggestions that added to making it a wonderful stay!"

This is quite a popular Airbnb and that is a great thing. It resulted in a bit more wear and tear in some areas. I've got a high bar set for cleanliness when we stay places and this home was maintained and tidy, just not immaculate.

Stayed with kids","My family and I frequent travel from Houston to Taos or Colorado and are always looking for a stop or two to map out our road trip. When seeing “The Barndo” and its price listed I snagged it instantly.
It met our family of 4’s expectations above and beyond! Brandy has thought of it all, EVERYTHING you need for a comfortable stay or even something you didn’t think you needed but actually needed she had.
We walked in on a hot summers day of travel to a crisp/cold/clean house welcoming us for our stay.
It’s proximity to Amarillo, Palo Duro and Canyon is ideal for travelers who enjoy adventures in new places. We even hit up a couple of her suggested places in the book she left and were happy with the outcome.
If you are looking for a spot to stay in this part of Texas, honestly look no further, you’ve found a home away from home!!
Safe Travels and we will def be back!

Stones throw from the interstate and easy to get to and from. Being so close you’d never know with how quiet the place was! One bedroom was super small but had a full size bed and a tiny tv to watch so it wasn’t bad at all! Shower water pressure was the best! Would definitely stay again whenever going that way!"

Stayed a few nights","The Barndo was a great choice for us while we visited Palo Duro Canyon State Park for the weekend. It provided a great space for us to rest after hiking all day. The Barndo was just as described with more than enough room for the four of us. Stocked with plenty of coffee, some snacks and water, plus anything we might initially need upon arriving after a 10 hour drive which was great! Brandy was very quick to respond to my questions and very cordial. I would recommend this place for anyone planning a stay in the Amarillo/ Canyon area."

Stayed one night",came in went up to lay down and watch TV and the remote hardly worked so we watched TV on our laptop. then went outside to smoke since there was a fire place listed as an amenity and we barely got it to turn on once for a couple minutes and then it wouldn't turn on again so assuming it needs new flit or more propane. they shouldn't have marked it out of order...then there was this awful rattling noise all night long that woke me up every hour. host was rude and unaccomidating over an 8 dollardifference because my card messed up so then when I got it fixed we re booked just to have a horrible experience. Tanya is a much better host with actual 3 bed room houses and not a bed room that's a bed in a literal CLOSET. we will definitely remember to stay loyal to our usual lady who's nice and has outstanding homes.

Great outdoor space and plenty of room for the boys to run around. Wish we had a few more days to spend there.
As mentioned in the listing, the primary bedroom with the queen bed is very open (it’s a loft) so there is very limited privacy.
The small room with the full size bed was perfect for our six year olds to share, they enjoyed the novelty of the “kid size room”.
Overall a great stay!"

It was close to Canyon's square but far enough away where you didn't feel like you were in the hustle and bustle of the town. We checked in after dark and it was nice to come to a home where the porch light was on and a few lights on in the house. Felt safe the entire time and the home had such a welcoming feel. Natalie did a great job of communicating ahead of time, providing clear and helpful instructions about everything, even some things we wouldn't have thought about. It was such a great space and was everything we could have wanted and more! Will definitely be booking again when in Canyon."

This was definitely a great place to stay! My parents stayed with us and we had the perfect amount of space. Natalie, responded well and we enjoyed our special time away!!

It is right next to train tracks as stated — but trains don’t use horns and you can barely hear them going by— and we had 2 little boys with sensitive ears!

They prepared brochures and pamphlets for activity suggestions as well as restaurant recommendations. They also had fresh herbs in the back which we were allowed to use. We would go to the park for the most of the day and come back to watch a movie and relax. It was also so close to the Canyon Square store and the adorable farmers market they have on Saturdays.

As tenured airbnbers this was our absolute favorite place!
So impressed with all the details throughout the house that kept it on theme without making it cheesy.
The hot tub under the stars was fantastic and breathtaking.
The location was gorgeous, serene, and secluded without having to drive too far outside of a major city.
We had fun playing the provided mini golf, laying out in the hammocks, rocking in the chairs on the wrap around upper deck porch, and gathering around fire pit. There was also a grill and a tent provided, that we unfortunately didn’t have time to use. Ches provided so many amenities that it was easy to stay-in and vacation there without just making it a landing spot after driving to other destinations on our getaway.
Ches was the perfect host, was excellent at prompt communication, and you could tell he wanted to make sure all his guest have the best time at his “Saloon”.
We already want to be back!"

The skylight above the bed where one can look at the stars, along with the cozy electric fireplace in the loft bedroom, lends to a contemplative ambience. The outdoor fire pit would be great for making S'mores with the kids. Too bad I didn't have them with me, but hopefully on another trip. The tiny home is in a quiet area where the stars are your company. It makes for a great stay! I hope to make another stay there. Chesley is a great host! He communicates well, is responsive, and obviously takes great care of his place. He was a pleasure to deal with."

How to even fit into words how much we loved this place will be a challenge. Ches’s place was amazing and more than I had even imagined! His attention to detail around the place as well as with the reservation and stay its self was phenomenal. My husband and I throughly enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere and even wrote a song together while there (musicians). We have already started planning to come back when it’s warmer and we can utilize more of the outdoor amenities besides just the amazing hot tub. I’ve also started sending the link to the Sunset Saloon to other friends in this area as well as those farther away that have started a “wish list” of unique Airbnb locations they want to visit. We couldn’t have asked for a better stay; from the location, amenities, cleanliness and responsiveness of the host than what received at the saloon!"

The country western aesthetic is so much cuter in person and the pictures already look great. We definitely want to come back and stay again. It was so peaceful and at night you can see rabbits on the property. The stars were also crazy beautiful out there because of the lack of light pollution.
So peaceful and warm. 10/10 stay for sure and I’m recommending to everyone. I hardly ever write long reviews but this was worth it."

Everything was clean, tidy, and even better than I thought it would be. We had up to 50mph wind gusts two days/nights, so it wasn’t ideal for being outside, but once the wind died down, we hung out on the patio and it was great.
Coffee in the morning watching the sunrise and a glass of wine at night watching the sunset and seeing the stars was a peaceful break I needed. My kids have asked to make this actually trip."

Chesley was one of the best host I have ever had. He is extremely accommodating and you can tell the love that he put into this place.
I would recommend this place to everyone.
All I can say is WOW!"

It might be the cutest little house we have stayed in on our entire two week trip! We loved it so much, and may have to return for a longer stay sometime! The views for miles were spectacular! Thanks for a wonderful stay! ~Violet & Ian"

Stayed a few nights","We spent our ""minimoon"" here, and the Sunset Saloon was the perfect place to unplug and relax! You can really tell that this place was built and designed intricately. The interior really gave a saloon-like feel, and was incredibly clean! We spent much of our time taking advantage of the beautiful outdoor space. We grilled, played yard games, and enjoyed the scenic views. The saloon is perfect for watching sunrises, sunsets, and the stars! The host was responsive and friendly, and we would absolutely love to stay here again! Such a perfect place to get away!"

There were a few house flies that got into the place when we opened the doors and were a very minor nuisance, but not during the night. Probably inevitable given the rural location and in no way detracted from an amazing stay. Ches has succeeded in creating an extremely comfortable, fun, unique AirBnB with the additional benefit of nice outside spaces to relax. 100% recommend."

The only downside is it is farther from Palo Duro state park and Amarillo than we thought based off the listing. Palo duro is about a 35/40 minute drive and depending on where in Amarillo you’re going it’s 45 minutes. Not a deal breaker but was farther than we were hoping from Palo Duro. Otherwise the stay was great, lots of little wildlife around and beautiful view of the stars on a clear night. Ches was super helpful and quick to answer any questions!"

We are absolutely coming back and I am recommending it to everyone.

My husband and I included Canyon, TX in our road trip so we could go hike at Palo Duro state park and we wanted somewhere peaceful to stay. The Boxcar was clean and quiet. There is honeysuckle planted around the property and we were lucky to be there while it was blooming, it smelled amazing. The hottub was great after our day hiking. We watched rabbits and quail from the patio in the mornings and evenings. There were neighbors closer than expected from the pictures but that was the only minor downfall. It was still quiet the entire time we were there."

Stayed one night","Staying in this beautifully converted 1904 refrigerator boxcar was an exceptional experience, offering a stunning view of Amarillo's plains from the comfort of a modernized, rustic interior. The indulgence of a hot tub under the expansive Texas sky, both day and night, was a true highlight. The shower room stands out, with its original refrigerator wall and floor that retain the boxcar's historical charm.
There are two minor points to note about the shower room: firstly, managing the levers to adjust the shower temperature can be a bit tricky, and secondly, the stylish custom-made shower head delivers a straight downward pour, which might not suit you if you prefer to keep your hair dry. Despite these nuances, the boxcar's charm and uniqueness make it an essential destination for anyone in search of a retreat that's far from the ordinary."

Brian's boxcar was about the same price, but under a giant sky with a ton of privacy including an awesome private hot tub!
Best of both worlds, there was still a nearby town with a giant grocery store a short drive away."

Stayed one night","I had an incredible stay at Bryan's Boxcar Airbnb in Canyon, TX! The clear instructions he provided made check-in a breeze, and his attention to detail in outlining guest expectations was much appreciated. The boxcar itself is a treasure trove of history, and the peaceful, private setting creates a serene atmosphere that's perfect for a getaway. Bryan's hospitality (he responds quickly) truly made this a five-star experience. My husband and I stayed on our way out west, and we truly could not have asked for a more unique experience. It snowed while we were there, and looking out to the pasture from the hot tub with snow falling all around was remarkable! Wonderful experience."

Stayed with a pet","A unique stay that we appreciated. I was worried about its remoteness but the property is less than 15 minutes from Canyon that has a great selection of restaurants (highly recommend Mickeys on 5th Ave). But if you wanted to cook your own food, there is a hot plate under the cabinet. And of course the grill, which we didn’t get a chance to use. We didn’t use the hot tub so can’t comment on that. A heads up to other tall people, the queen bed will not be comfortable for two tall people. One? Yes. Two? No.
Overall it is a great property, great host, and was what we needed for a quick stay as we visited Palo Duro."

I don’t think the pictures do the space much justice but I was a bit surprised to see how spacious it really was, everything extremely neat and easy to find, and a very comfortable bed.

The property does feel very safe and secured, we were able to enjoy our nights in the hot tub with the occasional visit from the rabbits.
Again we are very grateful to have spent our first wedding anniversary here and we hope to spend some more in the future here!

Stayed with a pet","What a cool space! Private and off the beaten path with the enormous Texas sky above. The space is unique and has such a cool history. It is clean and everything is well-apointed. The linens are clean and the bed is very comfortable. We enjoyed a cooking a steak on the grill and then soaking in the hot tub under the stars. Keep in mind that you are in the country when you book. The panhandle winds are there, but the box car is situated as a bit of a wind break. The good thing about it is that you don't even need a towel when you get out of the hot tub! The flies made their presence known during our stay, but it was not unbearable and the host has made sure that there is a fly zapper and old-fashioned fly swatter for use by the guests. If you want a unique and comfortable stay in the Texas panhandle, book this with confidence."

It was cloudy upon arrival and we only had it uncovered for a short period of time while 1 of us used it and the cover was immediately replaced. We read the stay instructions and followed them all including respecting all requests. I almost took a picture of the cloudy water for fear of being blamed for it, but I had too much faith in the hosts. Cool place but wouldn’t recommend staying with hosts who are dishonest."

The flys were relentless and there were bugs crawling everywhere we looked inside. The boxcar has such great potential.

Stayed one night","Unfortunately we did not end up staying the night. Upon arrival around 1am, we immediately had several strange interactions with the neighbors including hearing voices very closeby on our property which was isolated with no nearby neighbors. When we called the host to ask about something strange we encountered, he gave us a vague answer that left us feeling more unsettled. This along with the swarming bugs all over the front door left us feeling uncomfortable, and since we needed a good night's sleep, we just decided to stay in a hotel. The host never followed up with us afterward, but communication prior to that was good. The place did seem very accurate to how it was described. I believe it would be possible to have a good stay there, but our experience just left us feeling weird."

Stayed a few nights","We really loved the setting and idea of this stay. As international travellers we were keen for the remote setting and experience, but felt that a few things could have been improved.
-The towels provided are very old and need replacing.
-There are only a couple of mugs available and one of them had a handle broken off completely, and knives are blunt
-I had asked for the fold out couch to be made up on booking, this hadn’t been done.
-I had asked if the washer and dryer were available for use and was told they were. On arrival they were set up with washing liquid pre-added for the end of stay wash. We completed our washing but also had to empty the lint filter on the dryer as this clearly hadn’t been done in a long time and posed a fire hazard.
-the wifi didn’t work for us (password wasn’t accepted), which we did communicate at the time to our host
We were also a bit surprised about the tasks we were asked to complete to vacate, given the cost of the two night stay."

Stayed with a pet","The experience was unique and that is what we were looking for. Unfortunately, the area had experienced lots of rain lately and then a heat wave which was the perfect storm for flies. During our stay we were unable to use the hot tub or sit outside do to the number of flies (hundreds) that would swarm and bite you. They would also enter the boxcar every time the slider was opened and the next 40 or so minutes was spent killing flies. The towels provided were extremely thin and worn (should be replaced. Cleanliness could be better, but again you are located on a ranch and in West Texas. We are in the midst of a 60 day road trip (all stays in AirBnb’s) and I felt the cost for what we experienced was overpriced compared to where we have been and where we are going. Canyon is close as well as Palo Duro. This was one of the stays my wife and I were so excited for, unfortunately the fly situation (out of Brian’s control) put a damper on the whole stay."

Stayed a few nights","The boxcar is in a lovely remote location in a wide open field; there are other houses and farm buildings in the distance, but nothing super close. It was very cool to be out on the Texas plains! The bed was comfortable. Amenities are basic, especially for the price (e.g., old/thin/kind of musty towels; minimal toiletries; guitar was missing a string). You have to take your linens & towels to a separate building and start the washer on checkout, despite a cleaning fee.
We had an extremely windy thunderstorm during our stay; water leaked in around the windows, door, and A/C but not into the main area of the boxcar itself.
Accessibility notes: the hot tub cover is *very* heavy (which is needed because of how windy it can get). We were able to use it without a problem, but if you have any mobility issues or constraints, you may not be able to get the cover off. Watch your footing near the bed; there are sunken metal areas next to the bed and it would be easy to trip"

Brian was responsive to our questions and didn’t hesitate to offer to come by and help out. The hot tub was great at night for sunsets and stargazing. There was even a guitar at the location for guests to play, which was a pleasant surprise."

Stayed with a pet","Great experience at the boxcar! We arrived with a storm in the distance. After a long day on the road, a dip in the hot tub was the perfect end to the day. As we got ready to go inside, the storm clouds made for an amazing sunset.
The boxcar was well furnished and comfortable. The shower was awesome and unique. The layout is minimalist, but perfect for a night on the plains.
The storm rolled through, and the wind moving around the exterior of the boxcar made it sound like you were rolling down the tracks, but there was no movement at all in the car itself.
We only stayed for a night, but would love to come back for a longer visit to explore the canyon lands more fully.
Thanks for a great stop/stay Brian!"

Stayed with a pet","When we checked into the Airbnb, it was filled with giant moths and flies. There were over 60 moths swarming around; we had to run out.
After a 11 hour drive, all we wanted to do was sleep and maybe spend some time in the hot tub. Instead, my party spent the next 3 hours killing and swatting the infestation. We hardly slept because we just felt icky.
This was an awful and disappointing experience."

Stayed with a pet","We chose the boxcar because it was different & the idea seemed pretty neat. When we arrived we were pleasantly surprised with everything it had to offer. It was the perfect space for 2 & had everything we needed for our stay. We loved the rustic boxcar theme & we were so glad to have picked this place to stay in. The host left great instructions and there was nothing to assume. We will be back soon!
For those who are in town to visit Palo Duro Canyon, this is a perfect location and is only perhaps 12-15 mins away from the canyon. It is also located maybe 5-7 minutes from the town of Canyon & its gas stations/grocery stores/etc."

We got our reservation quick, the house was open and clean when we got there. The hot tub was primed and ready to sooth us from our travels. Due to the nature of our visit, he extended our check out time which allowed us to get proper rest. An excellent stay, will go back to show Fiancé some day!"

Stayed one night","This was great for a quick staycation and definitely held up to the privacy and quietness it promised. The stars were absolutely beautiful as there is little light pollution. The bed was comfy and the shower setup is pretty cool- definitely a good experience. While we enjoyed our stay— the Hot Tub, being a big reason we chose to stay here ended up being a big reason for disappointment. The patio area to include the hot tub really just needs some TLC. The poor repairs to the hot tub and the floating bits of paint/whatever the material the cover is made of was off-putting, even after we thoroughly used the net. The topper is extremely worn and the underside of it has material quite literally chipping and falling into the tub. In hopes these are addressed soon, this is a really neat place with a lot
of history and is absolutely worth the stay!"

Stayed with a pet","I arrived at night so I followed the gps and it took me to a house. I messaged the host and right after, I think it was the host that ran outside to let us know how to get there. I didn’t see any directions saying to go to the next driveway and follow it back. Maybe there was and I missed it? After I checked out, I realized an hour later I might have dropped my credit card on the property so I messaged him to see if he could let me know. I never got any response back. Other than that, we absolutely loved our stay. Great location for photos, serenity, scenery, etc. the place smelled great and seemed clean. The shower is awesome and got hot fast!"

Stayed with a pet","Overall, this was a lovely stay. The boxcar looks like the pictures and reading the history of it was neat. The inside was spotless and very cute. The bed was comfortable. The shower was cool, and had plenty of hot water for two quick showers. The hot tub was a fun amenity and perfect to get in after two days of hiking A few flags - the hosts weren't the quickest to communicate on the app, so if you anticipate needing anything, I would make .sure to ask in advance. We asked the night before we left if we could leave our things at the boxcar until 12 (checkout is 11) so we didn't need to leave valuables in the car for our last hike, but didn't hear back before leaving. You are asked to take the sheets to the wash/start the washer and take out the trash. Finally, as the pictures show you, you are surrounded by fields. So, even though the place is very clean, there are traps to catch mice/bugs/etc. under the sink/by the trash. Not a huge issue, but I'm very sensitive to things like that"

Stayed one night",Stephanie’s place was beyond what we expected! It was a very cute house in a very quiet neighborhood about 15 minutes from Amarillo. All of the rooms were quite large and it was clutter free and tastefully decorated. The bedroom was so peaceful and the bed extremely comfortable. Stephanie has taken great care to have everything you need for a wonderful stay. Our big mistake was that we arrived late afternoon and only stayed one night! It would be the perfect place and my first choice to stay for a longer visit to the area. Five great big stars for Stephanie’s lovely accommodation!

The bathroom was something my dreams are made of - from the soaking tub to the multiple mirrors, lighting, and counter space I felt pampered. We especially enjoyed the shower because after a long drive the water was hot and the pressure was ideal for unwinding. This AirBnB was both cozy and chic and is set on a cute street close to the restaurants. I would definitely stay here if I’m ever in the Canyon area again!"

I appreciated the thoughtful touches, including cold water in the fridge and a bottle of wine on the counter. The spacious bathroom with the double sinks worked out very well for my husband and me. I wasn't there long enough to enjoy a soak in the beautiful tub, but the shower was great. The king sized bed was so comfortable, too! My husband has restless leg syndrome but I didn't feel him move at all. Perfection!
Communication was excellent as well - clear and prompt and helpful.
Thank you for a lovely stay."

Stayed with a pet",the super chief box car was our favorite place to stay out of 3 stops kn our trip. the 20 minute drive to the canyon was great and its not far from a convience store if you need quick stuff. the boxcar has been remodelled in a very tasteful way. we appreciated some of the original componets that they left with the touches of modernism. the fenced front porch area was great to let the dogs out however there is no grass in the fenced area so you will still need to walk them outside the little patio yard. it was quiet and peaceful and had great views to west and sunsets. we would love to come stay again if we are ever that way.

Stayed a few nights","We stayed for 5 nights, 4 days - AWESOME The railcar/cabin is EXACTLY as pictured. On the edge of a ranch expanse--- uninterrupted prairie views to admire. Earth and sky---and the occasional mare and foal if you're lucky. Husband was skeptical about the cabin climate (insulated?, etc....) stayed perfectly cool entire time and when cold- faux fireplace not only warmed it perfectly, but added ambiance. Just chilled in front of an LED fireplace and looked out the beautiful picture window with a hot cup of tea.
Perfectly situated between THE canyon and Canyon or even Amarillo. Breakfast each morning in town-- either at Buff's or Ranch House--- hiked the canyon and spent the evening eating dinner in Amarillo. (Husband's favorite was Big Texan so that was the spot) But the locale of the cabin made everything very driver friendly.
Becky our host was super responsive, but otherwise stayed gone. Perfect.
Clean, beautiful, relaxing-can't recommend enough and hope to return ASAP!"

We love being able to hangout on the patio and watch the sun rise/set everyday and it was only a 15 min drive to Palo Duro. We chose to bring a griddle to cook on inside but they have a blackstone you could use outside. If you’re not wanting to cook though, there are plenty of restaurants within 10 min. There’s also a Walmart nearby if you’re needing anything big/food, but Becky was so great and provided a little bin of snacks and another in the bathroom with things you might need like sunscreen, bandaids, etc. which was so thoughtful.

The place is incredible! It is such a perfect use of space - the design is excellent, incredibly clean, and beyond comfortable.
We are also traveling with our dog who could not get enough of the land, the closed in deck, seeing the horses, and the views out the big window . Her sweet farm dog, Lucy, also came by to check on us in the morning.

You will be treated to a unique Sunrise each morning, that will be sure to set the mood for the great day ahead! At evening time, an equally unique Sunset to the West, which you can enjoy from the Adirondack chairs on the porch, or right from the cozy living room!
Your sleep will be blissful as you drift off, Stargazing up through the skylights in the super-comfy bedroom. Or, if you are lucky like we were, bask under the beams of a Full Moon throughout your peaceful slumber.
We pass through Canyon often, and look forward to our next stay in the Super Chief Boxcar! Thank you, Becky, for being a gracious and accommodating host, your property is beautiful!"

It was set up perfect with everything you might need and then some. The location was perfect, so quiet and peaceful. It is definitely worth the money. 10 out of 10. Great place and a great host."

Stayed a few nights","The place was quiet and peaceful and a decent location for our sons graduation from Texas Tech . There were some issues when checkin in, when we raised concern with the host with the cleanliness status , there solution was to send their cleaning staff which gave attitude to us during their visit. The host was direct about the only solution they can offer was giving us 4 hour window for a refund after we arrived late at night , just to pack and leave their premises the next following morning even thought they were aware of our intent to attend a graduation. I was very front with how I felt like I was being “pushed-out” to silence my concerns, the host try to confirm that was not their intentionand took ownership for some of the issues we had. Overall, we enjoyed our time with our family , thank you for having us."

Loved the array of books & games. The leather-bound instruction guide in the 3-ring binder was incredibly helpful & chock full of ideas for activities & restaurant suggestions in the area; be sure & check it out. Lisa is a very responsive host. Home easy to find; well-lit parking right outside and easy to get to town, only a 10-minute drive. This is by far the most charming Airbnb we've stayed at.

We stayed in Amarillo on the way there and on the way back. I’m so glad we found this hidden gem! I wish we would have stayed the first time through! Lisa was extremely responsive, even late when we were getting in due to delays on our route. She even gave us recommendations on dinner for that time. I am naturally a planner & an over thinker, but I didn’t have to do any of that at this place! It was already all there! Playground for my young kids, a big enough place for them to enjoy! So many fun things on the walls for them to look at. A few snacks, and the kids room with bunk beds was so nice! My daughter woke up asking if we could purchase those mattresses! we were greeted by her husband Don and that was so nice because it was late & dark. He showed us everything and really put our minds at ease about safety at their place. 10/10 recommend. 🙌"

Group trip","The Canyon Casita is an awesome place to stay and the hosts are wonderful. The pictures are fairly accurate but do not fully do it justice. Although it is a converted garage office/building, it is not noticeable and is extremely comfortable. Additionally, while it is next to the hosts' house, it is on the garage side and separated from view - so privacy is not a concern. The location is in a small subdivisions with several houses nearby, but not too close, and loud gatherings in the evening or night might not be appropriate.
The decor is definitely panhandle Texas and well done. The casita was extremely clean and well kept. The furnishing are higher quality and comfortable. We easily slept five (two adults and our three adult children) and would have had no problem sleeping six. The rental is well stocked and has everything needed (washer/dryer, towels, dishes, cooking pots/utensils, etc), plus some, to make the stay more comfortable. While there is only one bathroom, it is quite large and well laid out. There is a small area in front of the casita that is fenced in with a swing, several chairs, and a fire pit that we found very relaxing.
The location of the casita is a bit remote from Amarillo (15-20 mins), but was close to Canyon. There is a Walmart and convenience store within 5-10 minutes if supplies are needed - so easily accessible. Canyon is a relatively small town, but does have a few restaurants and fast food spots. We found the area around the town square to be enjoyable. If going to Palo Duro, it is a bit further (25-30 mins) and is a bit of a ""hike"". The location of the Canyon Casita actually worked out well as we went to Palo Duro several times.
The hosts are pleasant and accommodating. We really had no issues that needed to be addressed, so I cannot comment on their timeliness in addressing the same. They were, however, quick to respond to messages prior to our booking and before checking in - so I do believe that they would have been quick to respond to any concerns. Despite living next to the casita, the hosts were not intrusive and seemed to make it a point not to be bothersome. We did get a chance to meet them, as we crossed paths in the driveway, and found them to very friendly and gracious.
We were extremely pleased with our stay at the Canyon Casita and its hosts. We would definitely look to book it again should we return to the area."

Stayed one night",What can I say about Cowboy Casita other than it was perfect in every way!! The decor was stunning…As a Texas girl living out of state the cowboy western vibe is nostalgic for me. I loved all the art pieces. Every amenity was carefully thought out and the beds were so comfy! Even the bunk beds! Unfortunately my mom and I were only passing through on the way home to Houston from Colorado and were only able to stay one night. We definitely want to come back. In the area we drove through Palo Duro Canyon which is gorgeous…I want to return to do some of the hikes. And we ate at Feldmans which was delicious! Try their chicken fried steak! They even had a smaller version that was perfectly sized! Or just get the big size…you are after all in TEXAS! Go Texas sized! Thanks again for a lovely stay! 🤠❤️

I only wish we were able to slow down and enjoy it more! Coming “home” one evening we saw 15 or so deer lying in the front yard of the main house, which is always exciting!

It was far enough off the beaten path to feel like a quiet getaway, but close enough to town if you need to shop or want to eat at a little restaurant or even if you want to go all the way into Amarillo, it was an easy drive. We loved all of the cute western style decor and the extras like makeup wipes for the ladies, as well as snacks and coffee, etc. we had a great stay and would recommend this location. Thank you!"

Our kiddos loved the bunk beds and my husband and I slept like babies in the master bed - so comfy! The decor and small touches throughout the casita were everything. The Mason’s welcome book was so thorough and helpful. We enjoyed a couple of the local eatery suggestions - great food! I particularly loved that they included info on all the artists of the pieces throughout the Casita. We frequent AirBnB spaces - my husband and I agreed this is our favorite yet. We’d love to return!

Stayed a few nights","This was our first AirBNB experience, and it did not disappoint. The Canyon Casita was very nicely decorated, comfortable, and had everything needed to relax, cook a good meal, and enjoy being away from the city. Good location to get to Palo Duro Canyon. Great book full of local tips. Would definitely stay here again if it’s available next time we are in the area!"

Stayed with kids",Better than the pictures! This place was so perfect and welcoming! We only stayed on night but wished we would have stayed longer! Our daughter loved the bunk beds and seeing Sadie whenever she could. Hosts were fast communicators and everything you could possible think of was in the house! Would highly recommend this place and we would stay here again if we are ever in the area again!

Stayed with kids","This is a very special Airbnb, one of the favorites my family and I have visited. Don and Lisa have clearly put a lot of love and personal details into every corner of the space. It really did feel like a home away from home. Our kids had a great time on the playground equipment and with activities available to them inside the house. We also very much enjoyed the Christmas tree and festive lights inside and outside the property. Our only regret is that we didn't get to stay longer. If we are ever passing through the Texas panhandle again, this place would be a definite stop."

Stayed with kids","This place is adorable. The pictures show how cute it is, but I was still blown away by the stylish decor and elevated linens. Everything is new and clean. The bed is super comfortable with nice linens. The outdoor area is so charming. We roasted marshmallows with our daughter and relaxed outside. There is a huge play set that shared with the home too! Our daughter was in heaven. I would absolutely stay here again."
