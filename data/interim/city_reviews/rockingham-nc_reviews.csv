Stayed with a pet","Drag Week 2023 is what brought my husband and I to Rockingham. Rockingham Dragway and Rockingham Speedway are less than ten minutes from the cabin. Being avid race fans, we considered it a bonus that we could sit on the porch overlooking the lake and hear the familiar sounds of drag racing in the distance.
The cabin is cozy and comfortable. The property is beautiful and inviting. Having a full kitchen was nice as we were able to easily prepare our meals. The porch overlooking the lake is where we spent a good bit of our time. We enjoyed our stay and hanging out with Patty the duck was a highlight.
Lisa was wonderful. She checked in on us to make sure everything was good to go and even shared a bit of history regarding the cabin."

We took advantage of the game room on rainy day, watching movies and playing arcade games. Our dog loved the fenced-in yard and exploring around the pond. Daryale is super responsive and helpful. The location is so convenient to the event we were participating in at the Dragway. We hope to make this an annual trip to Daryale's place!"

The game room with a pool table, Mrs Packman, and Galaga was a huge hit for the kids. Would 100% rent here again!"

We got in a little late and the house was lit up beautifully with outdoor lighting. The ambiance was its own vibe. We were in awe when we walked into the game room and it just kept getting better. The kitchen was amazing, stocked with all of the essential needs for cooking. Daryale provided snacks for us and cute little personal touches all over the house. The master bathroom was AMAZING. The shower in there is the best. We woke up our first morning and went out to the lake and just hung out on the swings and fished. The lake is stocked with decent bass. It’s absolutely gorgeous. The group of us drove down for a sporting event and have decided to make this an annual trip. There’s no need to book anywhere else."

Group trip","This could have been a better experience for our family had the owner taken the time and money to clean up the home, inside and outside. As we pulled up to the house, we noticed large cobwebs in all the windows, and broken outdoor furniture as we entered the home. The refrigerator had someone's open food in it , the appliances had not been cleaned well, and the floors didn't look as if it had been cleaned.The master bedroom matress and boxspring still wrapped in plastic with what looked to be a disposable mattress cover. We could not enjoy sitting on the porch because of cobwebs, dirty, and broken furniture. Not a comfortable experience."

Group trip","House : This place was absolutely amazing & peaceful ! Plenty of things to do .. basketball goal, grill , pool table , PS4 w/ games , Darts , Pac-Man Machine and a nice size tv right next to the Bar (byob) . She did leave complimentary wine tho . The kitchen was absolutely beautiful. My dad is a chef and he LOVED the kitchen . Bedrooms and bathrooms are beautiful also.
Nice areas if you like sitting outside .
The pond was my favorite part: soooooo many fish you could look down and actually see them swimming around the private dock . All sizes too . We caught plenty . There is also a sitting area at the pond right next to a fire pit .This place was everything !!!
Host : The host was very responsive, flexible, & polite ! She even was willing to help accommodate some special requests that I had . Definitely on her way to being a SUPER HOST . What are you waiting for book it NOW !!!"

Stayed a few nights","This house was considerably better than I expect in many ways. The beds were comfortable and fairly new, the house seems to be mostly newly remodeled, has the vast majority of the things you need. The house is tucked away from everything, which was very nice, and only a few minutes from food, the speedway, and downtown Rockingham.
The only concern is some potential with cleanliness. The master bath had bottles of shampoo, condition, and other items as to be expected. However, the two the bottles were half empty and clearly used already."

Made it feel not private like we hoped for. We are all adults and not partying, so nothing to hide, it just felt like we had a neighbor literally right there which was kind of the whole point of driving so far to get away from. House was great though!!"

We stayed for a week and used the pool table and the kitchen was great! Daryale was very responsive and took great care of us!! We will stay again and recommend to anyone heading to Pinehurst for a great week! Thank you again!

We wish we would’ve been able to use all the amenities but we were not there long enough. It is in a private subdivision which gave us a sense of peace.

Stayed a few nights","The place was clean.... so clean. I am very particular about bathrooms and it was so clean. The area is quiet and feels very safe. The house is comfortable. I especially appreciated being able to cook meals. My only issue if you can call it that is the cleaning fee waa high, the highest I have ever paid and thr house is not large. But... maybe thats the going rate. My issue was with the list of things we were expected to do when we checked out: Load the dishwasher and run it, take out the garbage, strip the sheets and take everything to the laundry room. If I pay a high fee for a service, I expect it to be done by the person I am paying. It would be no different than hiring a cleaning company to come in and they give me a list of things i have to preclean. It isn't logical. Also, I was sharing the house with a country boy truck driver who was not very clean to begin, and since we paid for the cleaning fee, I was not going to clean up after him."

It allowed us to stay together like a family, instead of having multiple hotel rooms. This place was perfect. Clean, well stocked with any kitchen accessory we may have needed, and the softest dish towels! Lol I really liked the dish towels!
The check out instructions were easy to follow and minimal.
Thanks again for allowing us the privilege of staying in your home.
Side note- our weekend here was cheaper than the hotel rooms we had originally booked would have been and we were much more comfortable!!"

Stayed about a week","Honestly The house was fine. I had agents come in to stay while in town doing training the Only issue I have with hose is they charged me extra 250 for cleaning fee bc the trash can in bathroom was not fully emptied out, a few coffee cups left in the sink and there were a few items left in the fridge. Yes I get it that’s not 100% following check out protocol to the tee and my agents have been reprimanded for that but extra $250 for this when it takes 2 extra minutes for the cleaners to handle.. I do not agree with that. So only warning is make sure you leave it spic and span or extra fees will be added"

Stayed about a week","This is the second time we've stayed with Steven and Jessica. The house is beautiful and roomy, but you can definitely tell it's an older house that's settled. We loved it the first time we stayed, all though we only stayed for a few days during our first trip. This time, we stayed a week, and it felt a little less glorious. There was construction started every morning on the attached apartment at 830am, so there was no sleeping in. They were nice enough to stop when we laid our twins down for naps. It was inconvenient to listen to the hammering and impact drilling throughout the day, especially when we had company over. Had that been disclosed prior to making the reservation, we probably would most likely have looked elsewhere. One other issue we had was that they only allot you two rolls of toilet paper and two trash bags for a weeks stay for a house that sleeps 6. Otherwise, our stay was great. It's a beautiful place and they are continually working on renovations"

Stayed one night","My sisters and I stayed at Steven and Jessica’s 2 bedroom apartment in Hamlet since our nephew was getting married at the Southern Dream wedding venue 15 minutes away. The hosts were accommodating to our request ahead of time for a slightly earlier check-in so that we could get ready for the wedding. They were extremely responsive prior to and during our stay to any questions we had.
Easy keyless entry, street parking right in front of the home, quiet neighborhood, listing photos were accurate, everything was very clean and aesthetically pleasing, and the two beds (a queen and a double) were comfortable. The little basket of snacks/kcups was a fun surprise. There is a second entry/apartment to one side of the home, but we didn’t notice any extra noise or disturbances during our stay. We wish we could have stayed an extra night to take advantage of being able to walk to downtown Hamlet and enjoy a coffee or shopping, but that will have to wait for another trip!"

Plus the convenience of the location was awesome. Cute little town with its own train museum and the seaboard restaurant the host recommended was great too. Also I had planned to come with my husband but he’s a marine and the marine corp is really good at messing up my plans so we (me and our two teenage daughters) came without him and we felt completely safe. Highly recommend!

Prepare to be captivated by the breathtaking views that the condo offers, immersing you in a realm of tranquility. The luxurious and upscale nature of the condo, the furnishings and well-thought-out layout contribute to an exceptional experience.
Countless evenings were spent engaging in delightful conversations with neighbors on the floating dock, against the backdrop of stunning vistas. Indulging in some leisurely fishing off the dock provided catches ranging from black crappie to bluegill.
The high ceilings create an expansive atmosphere, while the full-length windows allow the gentle morning sun to bathe the space, creating a delightful awakening each day.
Without hesitation, I wholeheartedly recommend this condo to anyone seeking accommodation in the vicinity of Rockingham, NC."

The backyard, with its chipping area and putting green, is a treat for golf lovers. Meanwhile, the grill set-up made our barbeque nights an absolute joy. The world-renowned Pinehurst Resort is just a 10-15 minute drive away, with many nearby amenities.
Uniquely, this retreat caters to golf enthusiasts and families alike, offering an ideal base for family vacations or golf getaways. We look forward to our next visit and highly recommend Crystal's wonderful home.

My daughter loved playing on the golf green and the rest of us enjoyed the screened in porch and the cozy indoors. I would highly recommend this house. They thought of everything to make your stay relaxing and fun."

Group trip","This gem of a home was full of surprises. Crystal's home is beautifully decorated with attention to detail I've never seen in an Airbnb. She welcomes you with a snack assortment, a Star Bucks coffee bar, and a detailed Guest Handbook. The kitchen is a chef's dream boasting plenty of counter space and open living space. The beds were heavenly, with luxury linens. The Bathrooms are clean and modern; she even provides great-smelling shampoo, conditioner, and body wash! TV's are in each bedroom, great Wi-Fi for connectivity. And don't get me started on the provided laundry appliances. I am now shopping for new ones just like these! ...And that's just the inside.
Outside is a golfer's dream with the putting green, chipping stations, firepit, and Jacuzzi! I can't say enough about this house. It was an unexpected surprise in such a small town. I don't know if I'll ever need to be in the area again, but if I do, I know where I'll be staying!"

The putting greens in the back were a huge bonus as well. This was one of the cleanest places I've stayed at.

Thank you to Crystal for making this possible with the beautiful home she has created! She made everything effortless and easy with very clear communication and timely responses. My whole family had a blast, there was something for everyone! There were many games provided including scrabble and our new family favorite, 5 crowns. My husband was beside himself that we got to have a fire in the outdoor fire-pit since it was cool at night! I also loved the fully stocked kitchen. There were place settings for 12 so our family of four didn’t have to do dishes constantly during our stay. One of my favorite peaceful and rejuvenating activities was drinking my morning coffee and evening tea on the porch and listening to the birds. The beds were very comfortable and felt like home away from home! She also had plenty of towels for our time there which was so nice. I am so glad that we picked this beautiful home in Pinebluff for our family weekend away. I wish I could give this Airbnb 10 stars! Thank you again, Crystal!"

It’s got three modes and the light fixture is a speaker! All in all, I enjoyed my stay with Christopher and I appreciated the amount of privacy I had, and all the help I received, as he was pretty good at responding quickly to any questions you might have. If I ever find myself in this neck of the woods again, I’ll definitely be staying using Christopher all over again. Thanks so much for a wonderful experience."

The bed is very comfortable and the shower is one of the nicest I’ve seen! Christopher the host and his wife were very kind during the stay and allowed me to checkout a bit later due to a last minute work meeting. I would highly recommend and stay here again!

Stayed a few nights","I had the pleasure of staying with Pat at her Airbnb while I was visiting the area for work. Her home is on four acres, and waking up every morning with coffee that Pat prepared was fantastic. The quiet and nature surrounding the house made it everything I could have asked for.
During my stay, I was able to wash my clothes and get a good night's rest without having to worry about any city noises or sounds from neighboring hotel rooms. The rooms and bathrooms were clean and comfortable. I didn't use the living space much, but the kitchen was perfect for preparing my food and storing it in the refrigerator.
Pat was great company whenever we had the chance to chat. Her conversation was warm and engaging, making the stay much more enjoyable than a typical hotel room. Sitting in the quiet and having someone friendly to talk to occasionally was a nice change of pace.
Overall, it was a pleasure being there, and I couldn't have asked for a better experience."

The room clearly wasn’t clean. It had dust all over the bed headboard, the covers weren’t clean and got bacteria bumps on my face from it and she tried overcharging me for the blinds i accidentally messed up.
Honestly and better communication skills was a lack."

I was in the area for a race about 20 mins away and was looking for a location nearby so I wouldn’t have to get up so early to drive.
Ms Pat’s place fit my needs. I checked in and Ms Pat greeted me at the door and told me everything I needed to know.
Her place is so very comfortable, peaceful.
My only regret is not being able to sit in her living room to talk with her and unwind. I was tired from my long drive and had to get up early the next day.
Coffee and light breakfast was available.
I will stay here again!"

Pat setup the coffee maker for me, this helped me get a quick start to my morning. The bedroom and bathrooms were well maintained and clean. I spent very little time in the kitchen or living room area. Personally, I didn't mind sharing the space with Pat; however, some people might not enjoy that idea. In addition, I have an issue with my back, although the bed was comfortable, just too soft for me. My daughter would have LOVED it."

Just be very careful of the driveway if you have a lower car because the tree roots are huge. We would have bottomed out if we were in my husband's car. But there seems to be space for street parking if that is allowed."

We easily made dinner for 6 in the kitchen (only 4 stayed there) and ate out at the picnic table at sunset which was lovely.
The directions were easy to follow, and the very few requests/rules totally reasonable (I’ve stayed at some places that have ridiculous rules and requirements). The host was available and responsive by message, but otherwise gave us privacy. I’d totally stay here again if in the area"

It had everything we could possibly need. Becky even brought over a brand new tv for us to use. She was so nice and communicated quickly. I highly recommend Becky’s cabin if you want to get away and enjoy a peaceful vacation. We loved it!"

Stayed one night",Deborah is an exceptional host. She’s gone the extra mile to make sure you have everything you could possibly need! The home is cozy and clean! A step back in time on the outside (reminded me of visiting my great grandfather’s home years ago). Very updated and maintained on the inside. Peaceful. We loved it!

Stayed one night","This was the perfect stay for us. We like to be a little off the beaten path, and this is an absolute gem of a place. Plenty of room, great kitchen, and quiet. We're already booked again, and this will be our go to when we're on the way to Myrtle or anywhere down that way. Deborah's place is a can't miss."

Stayed a few nights","We absolutely loved our stay at this adorable farmhouse - it was immaculately kept, conveniently well stocked and in the most beautiful location!
Pros:
- incredbly clean
- plenty of space outdoors with stunning views
- a.c. worked very well
- kitchen and bathroom were well stocked with snacks, toiletries and essentials
- beds were extremely comfortable
- bathroom towels were extra soft
- it was beautifully designed with old charm from the original hardwood and doors
- Deborahthe host was friendly and helpful, I enjoyed chatting with her in person
- grocery stores, restaurants and fuel are close by
No cons, but one thing to note:
- this is written in the listing, but the shower is quite narrow
It was apparent that Deborah has put lots of effort into her home and valued offering her guests a great experience. We would be more than happy to stay here one again whenever the opportunity arose!"

Stayed one night","Everything was great. Deborah and her husband, Dennis,dropped bynwhile I was outside exploring the premesis. They made for nice conversation. I loved the floors in this small cottage. I loved the fold out table. And I loved that Deborah provided breakfasts cereals in the cabinet and milk and wggs in the fridge. It definitely had that down home feel."

Stayed one night","Hard to say just a few words -- this absolute gem is quiet, private, BEAUTIFULLY renovated and SPOTLESS, and has all kinds of snacks and breakfast foods, teas and coffees, honey and sweeteners, and even fresh eggs and milk for morning coffee or cereal! The beds are comfy, there are no strange noises, the towels and bathroom supplies are terrific and plentiful. This is one of the nicest places I've ever rented in SC. Two things to be aware of: it was hard for me to see the little entry code dial on the door at night, and there are quite a lot of bugs outside as this is the countryside. But bugs are not inside unless you leave a door open. The place is immaculate and Deborah is attentive and so kind! I would love to stay here again."

Stayed with kids","Deborah’s house is a lovely little gem in Chesterfield. It is situated on a quiet street with plenty of room for my children to run and play. There are even horses across the street! The house was WELL equipped with everything you might need. Spices, coffee, kitchen supplies, towels, soap…The house was incredibly clean and tidy. The AC worked really well, which is really important for this northerner. She even left some farm fresh eggs at my doorstep in the morning! It is an absolute bargain. I will be returning."

The bedroom could use blackout curtains but other than that. the place was perfect, and the host was more than friendly and helpful."
