Stayed a few nights","The house was the perfect oasis for two couples during a busy week. Even more spacious and light-filled than the photographs, we appreciated having the bedrooms and bathrooms at separate ends of the house and a kitchen with all of the tools we needed. The comfortable seating area by the pool was perfect for morning coffee, and the view of the canal was lovely. I hate cluttered AirBnBs and appreciated how simply and tastefully the house was decorated. Similarly, the instructions were clear and simple not superfluous or nagging. As people with a quiet, well-mannered dog who leaves no trace we appreciated that except for pet bowls there was also no trace of previous animals. We had a wonderful week together as a family and the house was a huge part of it."

Stayed a few nights","Matt’s house was amazing. It is even better than advertised in the pictures. Everything is pretty much brand new and the house has everything you need. The Kitchen is as modern as you can have and the island is gigantic. There are smart tvs every where that are easy to use ( I was there during March madness so this was awesome).
I really can’t say enough about this house. I am a host myself so I appreciate all the work that went into this, as it felt like home.
Matt was an incredible host. I needed help with something pretty late at night ( my mistake not the houses) and he went out of his way to help.
This is a top level airbnb and if/when I come back I will be staying here if it is available.
Thanks Matt!"

Group trip","Our stay at Matt's place was amazing and everything we could have hoped for. This property is gorgeous, well-equipped, clean, and has a fantastic location in a quiet, friendly neighborhood close to shopping and entertainment. My family's favorite feature was the outdoor feel of indoor living, with 5 huge sliding doors opening to the beautiful pool area. The pool and hot tub were warm and clean. We appreciated the availability of spices, cooking supplies and ingredients, toiletries, and linens. The furniture, including beds, were comfy, quality pieces in great condition. Finally, Matt was quick to respond, friendly, and accommodating. We look forward to staying here again."

Stayed a few nights","We absolutely loved staying at this Pink Bungalow. The neighborhood was quiet, peaceful, and enjoying a drink on the porch was a perfect way to end each day. Super clean and stylish yet packed with cooking utensils, dinnerware, tupperware, even a crockpot; making cooking your own food to save money, easy! Extra linens, beach chairs and towels, some cleaning supplies, shampoo/conditioner/body wash supplied. Master shower was super nice with it's double shower head (one rainfall shower head!). Closets were big, with lots of storage options. Ceiling fans and AC were awesome. TV's in living room and master bedroom were smart TV's, hooking up to our Hulu was nice. Washer, dryer, and dishwasher all worked as should. Definitely keep the front door closed, had many geckos hanging out with us on the front porch! Also, didn't hear a thing from our neighbor. Huge bonus! And this place is located so close to so much, it's really a prime location. Hosts were easy to communicate with."

Nice restaurants on 41N in Port Charlotte just minutes away. Todd's listing is pretty much what you want from an Airbnb, except for the lack of an Ocean View. I am sure you can get that too, for an extra $400 a night! I spent eight nights at Todd's and would do it again in a heartbeat."

Stayed with a pet","Scott and Avery's place was awesome! The setting is pretty and the location is convenient on a quiet street. The house had all the amenities you would hope for - plus some you wouldn't think of - and was very well stocked.
The house was very clean - we are pretty picky about that and were very pleased. The couch and beds were super comfortable and dressed in high quality linens/blankets.
We really enjoyed the awesome porch and the back yard. Best of all the host was friendly and obviously wanted us to be comfortable and feel like we were at home.
We were there for a month and would be happy to stay again for 1 night or one month. And I can't forget to mention the espresso machine in the kitchen! What a treat for us coffee lovers!! And oh yes - fresh eggs!
Thanks so much for a great stay - we highly recommend this lovely and comfortable place."

Stayed with kids","This house was a great setup for our family of 4. Two nice size bedrooms with large common areas inside and outside of the home (including seating for many guests in the formal dining room and outside by the pool).
The hot tub / pool combination were great for us and we even caught a few fish in the canal behind the home.
This home is conveniently located in an established cul-de-sac with residential sidewalks starting at the end of the street and continuing for miles and miles of great walking.
We took advantage of the restaurants at Fisherman's Village (8 minutes drive) and the Isles Yacht Club - reciprocal membership privilege's required. (3 minutes drive).
Finally we enjoyed ~1 hour drives to Venice Beach, Siesta Key, Manasota Key, and Boca Grande.
The owner has done a great job of labeling switches, providing basics like beach towels, paper towels, toilet paper, etc. Highly Recommend this place and would visit again!"

Stayed with kids","We thoroughly enjoyed our time in Punta Gorda at this listing. It was very close to Fisherman’s Village (local shops and restaurants) and our parents; who we were visiting. We walked every day in a new place. Manasota Beach was a 45 minute drive but beautiful and clear. Additionally, Naples Zoo was a great time- we saw things we never saw before. We loved the live music almost every night and even saw a dolphin right there in the canal out back on the first day!
The home was comfortable and accurately described. The neighborhood was quiet and welcoming. We truly appreciated the little things in the home, so we didn’t have to run right out for things.
Thank you so much for opening your home to us."

It was nice to have private bedrooms on each side of the house.
The views toward the canal were spectacular, enjoying sunsets reflected across the canal and at night, the colorful lights of the neighboring houses.
We got to meet the owner and he was very helpful and polite.
We are hoping to go back next year.
Thanks again, Homeport!

There were some hiccups with the hot tub, which was slightly significant for us coming from 20 degree temps to find some warmth, only to arrive to nothing but rain and 65 degree temps. It was quite frustrating not being able to use the hot tub whenever we felt like it. Everything else was lovely and John was great in assisting with the hot tub."

Stayed with kids","Teresa was a great host in that she was so responsive and worked hard to resolve our issues. I booked this place because of the amazing pool pics. I didn’t realize -or didn’t read-that the pool would not be heated and the hottub doesn’t work. Unheated pools may be ok for a few months of the year but if you have teenagers wanting to swim, it’s tough. To the owner’s credit-they worked several times to get the pool heated and by the week’s end it was working—but it was a challenging first leg of our trip. This place has great potential but could use a few upgrades. If you enjoy cooking, the kitchen is great! If you want a comfy house and not concerned about using pool in cooler months, this is a great place. Very safe neighborhood and close drive to restaurants."

Everything worked fine, and was just as depicted in the descriptions and photos. Although the house fronts relatively busy West Marion Ave., the interior is quiet and private. A big plus for visitors with a young child is the infant-helpful equipment the house offered: a high chair, a Pack N Play Grayco portable crib, an infant bath tub, and lots of cabinet latches and socket covers to allow for secure child-proofing. The well-maintained salt-water pool (spool), is an attractive and restful touch, as it functions as a large hot tub. Ron, the owner, was very communicative and helpful, and graciously provided a lovely fruit/treat basket to welcome us. Highly recommended, and a good value."

We LOVED the Spool and used it every day either in the morning or at night before bed - so relaxing. We were close to friends, parks and downtown activities.
We will definitely be back and already recommended to friends that fly south to warm up too.
House manager, Estellia, was like a stealth butterfly when we needed dishwasher soap one evening. 😁 She dropped off right away and we weren't expecting that. She was amazing.

The house was very close to a lot of restaurants and we were even able to ride the bikes there as well. The house was very clean and we would highly recommend this home.

Stayed a few nights","4/14/21: We came down with another couple from Upstate NY ... for 6 days ... the place was super clean, very well maintained and in a great location on the water. It has a mango, orange and new lemon and lime tree as well ! The landscaping was super well maintained at the rest of the house. It really looks much better than the pictures in Airbnb ad. The Saltwater pool was great ... we spent many nights there after returning from house hunting, eating and touring the area. Beach bikes were a plus and the area is a great place for a morning stroll. It was sad to leave ... but we'll be back again sometime soon !
Tips: Perch 360 rooftop bar/restaurant, Crab House, Captains table and Hurricane Charlies for the best sushi and seafood around ! All have sunset view outdoor seating. Everything is super close to this home ... We also recommend the Sunset cruise which has amazing dolphins swimming in front of and around the boat most all of the time. These people actually call them with a warbling sound ... like a farmer would call their livestock ... really cool.
I would highly recommend this property ... 5 star+. all the way around ! Thank You Ron ! Jim and Pam from NY (and Keri and Bob)"

We loved the layout of the house with lovely bedrooms, a huge kitchen, lots of indoor lounging space, massive windows that looked out on the lanai and spool and the canal. We were in the spool every day and ate many meals out in the lanai. We loved using the beach bikes to bike to Gilchrist park, and enjoyed take out from several restaurants close by. Three of us worked remotely for at least part of the day (before heading to several different beaches) and we all had great spaces to do that. A perfect place for Minnesotans to spend two weeks in December during a pandemic! Thanks so much to Ron and to Estillita and Bob for a great stay!!!!"

Two coffee makers, a Kuerig and a Mr Coffee. The refrigerator even has every condiment you can ever need. You feel at home the minute you walk in the door. The beds are super comfortable, the shower has awesome water pressure and the spa/pool is so relaxing. The lanai is well furnished with very comfortable furniture and the view to the water is beautiful. Seen some real nice Sheepshead right off the bank next to the boat lift too.

Fisherman Village is a long walk -- we did it twice -- or a short 2-minute drive. The tradeoff to the central location was traffic noise when you sat on the porch or in the nicely maintained yard (41 is just a block away), but inside was quiet. Would definitely stay here again!"

A short walk to bars and restaurants but situated on a quiet street in the historic district. I loved the location and the price was great for this time of year. You can tell the hosts are top notch because #1… the place was spotless, but more importantly there were some details in the home that often get overlooked in other airbnbs. From a clean coffee pot or Keurig water container, to quality renovations and local decor. They really did this one right. 👏🏻"

Close to town but also very private. The noise of town’s Main Street traffic was a little of a put-off, but worth the trade off overall for the location. Would recommend the host invest in a few “rock glasses” for libations. We will definitely book this cottage again!"

Stayed a few nights","We thought the place was nice. It was clean and welcoming. The neighborhood is gorgeous. You are steps away from the beach. At night, it was quite peaceful. Unfortunately, the upstairs portion of the home was super hot. We were told that something was wrong with the thermostat causing the home to be hot prior to our arrival; on the day, it was 95 degrees with a heat index of 102-105. Thankfully, the owners provided us with fans. But, five fans going at once to cool a small area is beyond loud, and it just didn't get the job done. So, we had to take away one star to note this inconvenience. Final note: if the AC is fully working on all floors, it's a wonderful stay."

We walked to four different spots for coffee and/or lunch/dinner and every one of them was delicious. The location is fabulous, we could even see the sunset from a short walk away. The inside is beautiful and the outdoor space can’t be beat. We are coming back to Punta Gorda in a few months and will definitely stay there again! Oh, and the hosts are sweet as can be!!"

The 2 pull out beds were comfy as well as the queen bed, which allowed us to easily accommodate the 2 adults and 3 kids. I liked that we could close the glass sliding door to the 1 area to create a quite area for the youngest to go to bed early. The area/RV Park is quiet at night. The kids enjoyed a swim in the pool/hot tub (open dawn to dusk & a short walk from the lodging) before we checked out. As expected, the kitchen and bathroom are small, but very functional and very clean. There were plenty of towels and linens (very clean and fresh). Chris is an excellent communicator and was easy to contact. I highly recommend The Pink Flamingo."

The house was beautifully decorated, the beds were comfortable and the bathrooms were spotless. They had every amenity we could want. The free welcome snacks came in handy for the grandkids until we could make a grocery store run.
We had to contact the host one time and we were super satisfied with his response.
We saw some cool fish by the green light off the dock, roasted marshmallows over the fire pit and enjoyed night swims in the pool. Our only regret was we could not spend more time at the property!
The checkout process was not difficult. Some rentals have such strict cleanup rules that I wonder why I have to pay a cleaning fee. The rules at this house are just common sense and not ridiculous.
We will definitely book here again when we are back in Punta

The pool was so clean and we loved the space around the pool, for non-swimmers still could feel apart of the fun! The kitchen island is huge, plenty of space for cooking and prepping meals! We had 7 people stay in this house and never felt cramped, we had plenty of space! The house had everything you could ever need, well furnished in every space! We stayed here for a New Years trip with family of all ages and everyone loved the house. I highly recommend staying here if you are in the area, the neighborhood was quiet and close to town.

It was close to grocery stores, downtown, and local restaurants. The host, Adriana, responded quickly to my queries before and during my stay. The backyard and pool area were very nice and well-maintained. In fact, I would want my own backyard to look like this. The only downside was that the property was located close to a busy highway and was not as quiet as I would've liked."

My family and I 1000% will stay here again!
It was amazing.
The house is roomy and charming! It is bright and airy. Super clean, well thought out. I felt right at home!
The hosts are so accommodating and communicative! Super friendly!
The pool and back yard area was beyond magical. During the day it is so cute with the putt putt golf, hopscotch and plenty of space to lay out and play! At night it is pure light magic!! It was so beautiful.
The pool was pristine and the kids LOVED it!! Perfect size perfect temperature, and it was covered and had a screen all around it.
I have nothing but rave reviews from my family that stopped by! I can’t wait to stay here again!
Thank you so so so much."

The ease of communicating with Adriana was like shooting your best friend a message! Quick response time, always pleasant and willing to accommodate! I really can’t say enough good things about our experience. I brought my 3 children ages 6-14 all of whom enjoyed the space as well! Just enough toys to keep them entertained while we were inside. The backyard was serene and plenty of entertainment all on its own! Pool and water toys were an added bonus and my 6 year old would have been content to never leave the home’s perimeter!! Everything you could need for a beach day was already provided. This was super appreciated and convenient as it saved time and money! But don’t forget to purchase ziplock bags or a few Tupperware for packing the coolers!! My family did not want to leave!! We will definitely be back!!"

Stayed a few nights","Adriana was an absolutely fantastic host. There was literally not a thing she didn't think of providing in her home and it was an absolute pleasure to book and stay at her listing. We were a little overwhelmed with the over the top yard decor and furnishings at first, but in the end enjoyed the quirkiness and it gives the property a bit of something you cannot find anywhere else. The noise from the interstate was bothersome the first night, as was the brightness of one of the bedrooms...but the rooms have sound machines and between that and my airline sleeping mask, I slept like a baby from there on out. The location of the interstate did make it very easy to get to where we were headed for our tournament. We have had issues with a previous host/rental, so with this being our first stay since that occurrence...this was a much welcomed and fantastic experience."

She was there for us when no one else was and kept the home we stayed at in amazing shape. It was honestly unfair of us as a guest to even put them in such a tough situation, but they did everything and more for us. For that we are eternally grateful and can highly recommend both Adriana as a host and her home that they let us stay in."

Smelled musty, dog hair all over the couch,dirty floor, stain on bed covering , ceiling fan in bedroom full of dust ,bathroom extremely small and finally dirty oven couldn’t use. Too noisy at times cause on a main street. But after all made it work . Loved Punta Gorda and will definitely be back. Jared tried to help with the issues but once I am there don’t care for people to enter after the fact. Was only refunded cleaning fee of 60 which is appreciated but wasn’t much should have been at least one night refund. The good news is I will only there pretty much to sleep.

The backyard wasn't finished but I still think sitting on the deck with a cold beer/glass of wine and a cozy fire would be great!

I enjoyed my stay but, I could just be picky.
We all know mother nature sucks, it rained and the back yard flooded, I was very excited for the patio so bummer.
But the water system is backed up, so the bathroom shower and sink would not drain for hours. Thankfully the toilet flushed.
I loved the Kitchen! I loved all the little extra with it! I loved the bed. wifi was slow for me but TV was very accommodating. I loved the options but with the TV so big and the house so small. With the other duplex right next to the living room.you can hear alot. I'd recommend it if you have Day plans to be out and come back to relax.
The parking situation but not his fault, just warning. Its almost a Main road and you have to parallel park and the cars will hit you. On my passenger side, my car was sideswiped. c"

Got a splinter while simply walking around post shower. The owner never replied to any of my messages. Love getting ghosted. Guys this place is it.. because …this is my favorite…the TOILET DIDNT FLUSH!! I always wondered what the person previous did before me. When we arrived the carpets were hanging outside getting some fresh air… some might say still drying but I say they were having a meeting. There was a baby crib, but no baby mattress for the pack and play. Wi-Fi?? No clue… never got the password to it. Oh and one night we came in and there was a gecko waiting for us on the walls. random spots of who knows what’s been on it. Oh this best part is …the house smells like smoke/ cigarettes."

The lack of sheets for the sofa bed was frustrating because I was asked a week in advance if I needed it and I answered yes. It's not ideal to drive 5 hours and then have to look everywhere twice for something so basic that isn't even there. Jared and his staff fixed it the following day by buying a Walmart Mainstay sheet set. Lame in comparison to the main bed. Overall, I love this place and hope to book it in the near future. Perfect for trips to the Bratty Paws Dogplex."

My pup Mofongo enjoyed the backyard and deck! It was a great place to have a cup of morning coffee while he nosed around! Big TV’s with lots of streaming options were available in the living room and bedroom for some late night channel surfing."

A lot of times pet friendly places will still have dog hair all over things and floor, and that was not the case here at all. The backyard isn’t fenced and the road out front is busy, but still private and great for walking dogs and taking them out leashed. Very close to a waterfront park that is dog friendly. Restaurants and bars within a mile walking distance. Neighborhood was safe and so many interesting historic homes. Would absolutely stay here again!"

I began trying to communicate with him on December 27th and it took two weeks of attempts before getting one call back. He did not follow through on issues discussed during that call and never responded about getting bicycles, which were said to be included. Please note that Air Bnb staff attempted to mitigate the bicycle issue, but were unable to get the host to respond. Air Bnb did a good job in their attempts to correct this issue. Note: all of this has been thoroughly documented through Air Bnb."

Stayed a few nights","Ninette's cottage was in a great place to be able to walk to downtown, fisherman's village, and Gilchrist park along the harbor. It had everything we needed and is a cute place.
Couple of notes-the yard floods easily and there was a lot of rain while there-and bless Ninette's heart-the last night it flooded up to the steps and she was out there adding pallets so we wouldn't have to walk through the 'mini lake'-many thanks!!
The listing said tv w/ cable, it's actually direct tv and not all packages are available (eg sports) - I inquired before hand because there was one game we wanted to watch and Ninette was very responsive to let me know so I could plan accordingly.
We did have one incident with a neighbor half a block away and a loud all night party that I had to call in - but I do believe this was an isolated case. Note that you are located on a fairly busy road that noise is noticeable while sitting on the porch.
Overall, it was great stay! lot's of cool things to do."

Water, creamer, fresh fruit and packets of popcorn and oatmeal! She also had a small tub of sugar for our coffee! Plenty of towels and linens. The area is close to fisherman's village and other downtown businesses. Highly recommend if you are visiting Punta Gorda :)."

She also checked in with me several times during the week to make sure I had everything I needed. The cottage is located in a great location in the historic district....just 2 blocks from the harbor and walking distance to all the shops and restaurants downtown. I love the town of Punta Gorda and hope to stay here again on a future visit."

Stayed a few nights","Ninette's cottage was perfect for us after living in a small camper van for a week. It is not huge, but exactly as described. The little deck out back gives privacy and a little extra room. The kitchen is sparse but has everything 2 people would need, including more extras (like olive oil, salt, pepper, spices, apples, water) which were not in the very expensive house we just rented in Captiva for our family reunion. We could walk everywhere in the historic area and particularly enjoyed the sea walk and park, where we got at least 5,000 steps in every day. Ninette lives in the house next door and checked in to make sure we had everything we needed, answered text questions almost immediately, and at the same time, gave us complete privacy. The price was very fair (less expensive than any hotel in the Fort Meyers area). It's not a Florida beach vacation, but that is not why we rented. Definitely recommend."

The cottage location is only a short drive to some amazing bars and restaurants-I recommend The Blue Turtle...and only two blocks from the Boardwalk, where I walked a short distance to Hurricane Charley's Restaurant, and to Fisherman's Village.

Easy in and out, parking without problem and Ninette was responsive to any requests. I have several minor issues that were important to me, but the average traveler may consider inconsequential. The television package was very limited, and a laptop computer may have helped. There was a coffee maker, not a Keurig, so either bring your own , or bring coffee you like. The sink could have used a garbage disposal. The shower faucet was difficult to use."

It is located in a 22 city block historic district which makes for nice walks to enjoy the architectural homes dating back to the late 1800s and early 1900s. It is within walking distance of Fishermen's Village, the 2 1/2 mile harbor walk, and the historic downtown district. The cottage itself is well furnished and stocked with all you need for cooking. We also enjoyed the enclosed patio deck area off of the bedroom area. Ninette was easy to communicate with both before and during our stay. If in the Punta Gorda area in the future, would not hesitate to stay again in this very efficient cottage."

The location of the cottage is super. Fisherman's Village is within walking distance. After three blocks you are already at the sea.

Stayed a few nights","Very nice, charming, spic-and-span cottage located in a laid-back residential area within the historical district (I believe) of Punta Gorda and within easy walking distance of those restaurants and waterfront areas. My stay was for two nights. The neighborhood is completely safe; I had no qualms about leaving my laptop/ipad in the cottage when going out to eat or walk. The cottage itself is situated behind the main house, making it relatively secluded among palm trees and tropical plants. The inside of the cottage is basically one large L-shaped room with sliding glass doors opening to a small private deck off the back. The kitchen had all the amenities, including a bulletin board containing some nice-to-know information and some complimentary fresh fruit in a bowl on the table and some chilled water in the fridge. The air conditioning worked fine and I left it on one setting as per Ninette's recommendations; there were at least two ceiling fans, one large fan directly over the bed that I occasionally used; all in all, the temperature remained quite comfortable. The immaculate bathroom with shower (strong water pressure) was very nice. There was a nice large wall-mounted TV in direct view of the very comfortable queen bed (with lots of pillows) that worked fine. The place was completely quiet and serene, quite nice to get some computer work done--with not a hint of outside noise including street traffic, which was minimal anyway as I noticed when walking in the neighborhood. There was a grassy parking area for my car to the immediate side of the cottage, so no need to park on the street. Overall I was very satisfied with the accommodations and would stay there again."

Stayed a few nights","The Charming Cottage lives up to its name in every conceivable way. It's a charming cottage, on a particularly charming, relentlessly tropical site that is walking distance to the harbor and downtown Punta Gorda - a place that ranks for charm right up there with my other favorite small cities in Florida, St. Augustine and Fernandina Beach (I know - Key West. But Key West is in a class by itself.)
While the outside of Charming Cottage is vintage Old Florida, the inside has been spotlessly updated. On the functional side, my wife and I especially appreciated the comfortable bed; the fast Internet access; and the fully equipped kitchen, with its new, full-sized stove and refrigerator, huge assortment of knives, serving spoons, spatulas and whatnot, three cutting boards of varying sizes, and even a grater. On the aesthetic side, we were equally pleased with the tasteful furnishings and wall art, the large flat-panel TV, and the private deck off the bedroom area.
Speaking of privacy, Charming Cottage will be especially appreciated by travelers who value theirs. It is set back behind the main house, well off the road. We never met our hostess in person, but we did not need to. Her AirBnB text messages combined with instructions posted to a bulletin board in the kitchen told us everything we needed to know to have an enjoyable stay.
If I could change one thing about Charming Cottage, it would be the speed limit on the otherwise beautiful street in the historic district on which it is sited. The street is one way with signs that ask motorists politely to be aware of cyclists and pedestrians but give no hint of the speed they should. Given no hint, most motorists seem to choose about 45. This is not an issue at all in the cottage because of its setback well off the street behind the main house, but the whizzing by is a bit of an annoyance when you're walking your dog along the sidewalk. If I were mayor of Punta Gorda, my first act would be to make that street two-way again and post the speed limit as a ""strictly enforced' 25 mph. No doubt commuters from the more suburban neighborhoods who use that route would vote me out after one term. But it would be worth it."

The parking spot, adjacent to the cottage, was very convenient, and finally, the location was very close to the harbor area and Fisherman's Village. would gladly return there again; I was sorry to have to leave a day earlier than originally planned, because my stay was so pleasant - she even left fresh fruit in a bowl on the table!"

Stayed a few nights","Loved staying here, it was exactly what I was looking for. it's like having your own private tropical resort. chose it initially because it's only 2 mi from downtown punta Gorda, but I probably wound up spending more time at the B&B because it was so great. Loved the hot tub and Tiki bar. I'll definitely be coming back. thanks Joseph!"

But our favorite evening activities were enjoying a glass of wine at our own private tiki bar and later relaxing under the stars in the hot tub surrounded by tiny fairy lights.

Stayed over a week","There were so many things that we appreciated about Joseph and his place. We had parking for our car, trailer and motorcycle, there was free and reliable internet, a huge smart TV that allowed us to connect to our accounts, very comfortable king sized bed with fresh linens and extra pillows, a very accommodating kitchen with stove, oven, dishwasher, pots and pans, cooking utensils, full sized fridge, Kureg coffee maker, microwave, dish soap, dish towels, paper towels, garbage bags, etc. We have rarely if ever had such a well equipped place! There is a full sized washer and dryer with detergent and dryer sheets. The outdoor area was fantastic. A hot tub in a private area, additional towels for the hot tub, zero gravity lounge chairs, a tiki bar, appropriate and comfortable lighting and privacy, and very well landscaped.
We were there for 9 nights and Joseph respected our privacy and was always super friendly! We will be back and have recommended this location to our friends!"

The kitchen area is modern and equipped with all you need for cooking simple meals. The hot tub/tiki bar area outside is which is surrounded by FULL landscaping, is SO private, making it easy to relax although there are other houses around you. There was an air conditioning issue during our stay, our host IMMEDIATELY addressed the issue and a repairman was there within an hour! We HIGHLY recommend this space if you are going to the Punta Gorda area! For the price... its a STEAL!!"

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I had a wonderful stay at Joseph's place! The neighborhood was incredibly quiet, allowing for a peaceful retreat. The adjustable bed was a delightful surprise, and the hot tub was just what the doctor ordered for relaxation. The huge TV was impressive, although the built-in camera was a minor concern due to its position in front of the bed, but it could be handy for video calls.
The AC worked efficiently for those hot & muggy Florida summer days. As a suggestion, adding blackout curtains might enhance the room's comfort and keep it cooler. Joseph, our host, was great. He met us at check-in after our delayed flight and genuinely cared about our safe arrival.
While there weren't many amenities within walking distance, there was a small convenience store at the nearby gas station. Overall, it was a great place to relax, and we'd gladly return if we're in the area again.

Stayed a few nights","Upper level unit in a four-unit residential dwelling, situated on a quiet residential community. The building is old, but the condo owner has done a nice job replacing and modernizing the flooring, bathroom tiles, and kitchen amenities. She has also added new, modern furniture to the bedrooms, living room, and eating area. I did feel the cleaning fee of $135 was very high. And for that price, and the two night stay requirement, I wish the owner had also replaced the very noisy fan that turns on with the light in the master bathroom; the shower curtain rods which were badly rusted; and the sliding door to the back patio that was difficult to maneuver. The bed and pillows were ok, not super comfortable, but they were new and sufficient. So while there are a few ways the stay could have been better, I appreciated that it was a quiet and clean condo with a straightforward check-in/check-out process."

Only two glitches to report, but glitches occur during a 10 day stay. The light in the main bathroom apparently has a ""short"" in it.
The bathroom off the master bedroom just seemed to run out of hot water in the shower. First few days was fine, but not the last few. Just couldn't get it hot enough. Handle on it may be too loose. A bit of a ""cold shower.""
Still loved the condo."
