Stayed with a pet",this place is perfect! close enough to everything in town but just far enough away to be peaceful. it was great because we had our dogs with us and it is extremely pet friendly but also very clean. The view is amazing. The hosts were easy to get along with. I highly recommend this day for anybody. especially if you have dogs!

The views alone were breathtaking but the home itself was better than the pictures, and obviously a labor of love! Our dog Frankie thought she had died and gone to heaven with the freedom to run in the valley behind the house and we could keep an eye on her easily. If more than 5 stars was an option Tom’s Stargazer would get them from us! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

It looked fantastic and had nothing but great reviews and it definitely lived up to those reviews. The view in the back of the home was wonderful. Sitting on the back porch and watch the sun rise while enjoying my cup of coffee was great. The kitchen is stocked with cook and dining wear and cold drinks in the fridge. I could go on and on about how much we enjoyed our stay. We Will definitely be returning!

Stayed with a pet","We had a wonderful stay at the Stargazer and HIGHLY recommend this gorgeous home. Tom and Cindy are spectacular hosts and really thought of everything to ensure their guests have a great trip. Their home is beautiful, extremely clean, and well organized. There were extra single packs of toothbrushes and other toiletries, canned sodas and drinks in the fridge, as well as a thorough guidebook with information about the house. We even got in late after driving 12 hours from Virginia the first night and Tom left the porch light on for us!

This house is great for singles and families alike with an ample backyard, games, and a telescope for those who really want to stargaze. It’s conveniently close to several restaurants and fast food as well as a large Walmart but is still tucked away in the beautiful hillside. We’ve traveled down here to visit family several times and generally stay in airbnbs and this has been one of our favorites. Thanks so much Tom and Cindy!"

So much thought and detail was put in to making it a wonderful stay. The view is breathtaking. I stay in airbnb’s about 30 times a year and this is the #1 place we have ever stayed. Will be back next year. Every host should take lessons from Tom on how to host a airbnb. We were in town for a festival and I forgot my Apple Watch when we checked out. They came to the festival and brought my watch. I can’t give this host enough stars.

The candy dish and the cold drinks were a nice touch! The tv set up was easy to use and the hook up of the system was really impressive ( even my husband said something about it). We had our dog with us and the dog bowls and treats at the end of the island made us smile. The bed was comfy and sheets were well made. The view to the back yard was amazing. We really enjoyed ourselves and hope to travel through again for another stay some time. Thank you for making our stop through so enjoyable."

Stayed with a pet",By far the BEST ABNB in which we have stayed. Tom's extras and his attention to detail sets him apart. The location is awesome with wonderful views. I could go on and on about this place. But it's best if you book it and find out for yourself. You will definitely enjoy your stay.

Stayed a few nights","This was our 4th time staying at Stargazer and my only complaint is the more people find out about it, the harder it is to book! It is exactly what an Airbnb should be. The location is my favorite out of all the Airbnb places I’ve stayed at. I think my dogs would agree. They love the amount of space to run. I always wish we could stay longer when we are there. We had a fiasco upon leaving with our trailer we were towing and Tom and Cindy went out of their way to help get us back on the road. Not only are they good hosts they are just really great people. I was very appreciative of their hospitality as we figured out a solution. We look forward to staying there again!"

The interior layout is very efficient and modern. There is a three ringed binder with tons of information about the house. Everything has a label… remotes, cabinets, light switches… everything. The house is very comfortable and clean. The wifi works perfect. The AC can freeze you out. The gas log fireplace is nice and even has its own remote. The owner has gone above and beyond with the amount of thought put into the user’s experience. There are niceties all over the house. The additions are more than you would ever expect from an AirBnB. The house is close to everything. I was able to check out some really great hiking within only about fifteen minutes. This was really an excellent overall experience. I’m grateful to have gotten to stay here and look forward to my next stay.

We were in town for a wedding and it was the perfect location while also being secluded for some much needed down time before and after events. Sitting on the back deck, enjoying the beautiful view was an amazing way to unwind. Tom thought of every single aspect of an AirBNB, and he also provided lots of extra perks as well, which most do not do. We will be back the next time we are in Cullman!"

Group trip","Casey’s cottage was perfect for our group. Casey was a very responsive host even before I booked the stay, I reached out with questions; she was quick to answer, very friendly and accommodating to our situation. We had a minor issue during our stay with the front door handle, I shot Casey a text and she had someone come over and fix it right away. Location was perfectly located close to stores and downtown area. Our group consisted of 3 families with kids and the house was perfect for each family to have their own room and space."

Finding leaf fragments between two towels in the bathroom was the ultimate leaf issue."

The living room couches and kitchen barstools were much more comfortable than I thought they would be, based on the pictures. The neighborhood was quiet. Because we were there very little, we didn't have time to take advantage of the back deck or the TV."

Group trip","Pros: Beautiful landscaping and well decorated. It was quiet and peaceful. The kitchen had dishes, pots and pans, and utensils. There were spices provided.
Cons: She does NOT PROVIDE coffee or state it clearly ahead of time, only the keurig machine. They only way you’d know is by noticing it’s not listed in the amenities. Additionally, the cleaning fee is very high, and she expects guests to strip the sheets, start the wash, start the dishes, and take out the trash. Plus, the house was dusty with cobwebs and had a musty smell until we had come in and gone out several times - like no one had been there in a while. The value of the house was perfect but, with the cleaning fee, it was expensive for what we got and were expected to do.
Conclusion: it was a very nice house and would recommend. We were there for one night. So perhaps a longer stay would offset the cost of the cleaning fee, which nearly doubled the cost of the stay for us. Very nice host, responsive and easy to work with."

The snacks were such a thoughtful and helpful touch, especially with our youngest picky eaters - big thanks for those!! I was also pleasantly surprised to see travel-sized toiletries included in the bathroom (you don't always find that in Airbnbs).
The location was great, just a few minutes from family, great restaurants, and the adorable warehouse district. We found the host's restaurant recommendations and instructions for the house to be exceptionally helpful. The family we were down there visiting came and hung out with us, since I'm allergic to all their animals, and they couldn't stop talking about how cute Our Place was! We loved the style and felt very comfortable.
We have already recommended it to another family member who will be traveling there over the summer!"

Stayed about a week",One major problem that guys need to correct now! You must install a three foot horizontal grab bar under the window in the shower and two foot vertical grab bar on the wall just outside the shower entry. Us old folks need them to prevent a fall. We found the house to be cold at night. I am up reading late at night. I had to wean myself in a blanket to feel warm. I suggest adjusting the programmable thermostat. Other than that all was well

The game room and awesome TV were great entertainment for we parents as well as the kids. Also, something that some people may overlook with short stays is that the kitchen was fully furnished with enough silverware, dishes, and cookware for a family of 6. That was a big bonus since we were there for an extended stay.
Fulton was a grest host and very responsive to us and the company our insurance used to setup the reservation. He was also accommodating when we needed to extend our stay an extra day for contractors to finish up at our house.
Overall it was a great place and we would stay again if needed."

We felt at home the minute we arrived. Lori responded promptly to our questions and was very patient in explaining how the thermostat worked! We laughed about that later. The old-fashioned staircases were tricky to navigate for us older citizens 😉, but we knew about that in advance and managed. We loved our stay and highly recommend it."

It is within easy walking distance of downtown, something my family especially appreciates. Lori was very responsive, replying to the few questions I asked within minutes.
The description clearly states you must be able to do stairs, and I will repeat that; you must be able to do stairs to enter the house. It wasn’t an issue for us but it could be for some.
I will certainly consider another stay in this home if we return to Cullman next winter."

Stayed with a pet","First of all, the place is very pretty and the pictures are very accurate. Lori was amazing.
The only issue we had were a couple of things:
1. It is a bit difficult to get heavy pieces of luggage etc. into the unit as you’re checking in because the only access point is a flight of steep stairs and at night it was not well lit
2. Inside the unit there was a lack of storage for clothing. For example, in the master bedroom upstairs, there is not a closet that’s accessible nor are there any dressers to store your clothes.
3. And the only other thing I had to complain about ties back to the first bullet point when you’re coming up the stairs or down the stairs from the kitchen to the basement, there are not any handrails past a certain point and that can be a little risky. My girlfriend did have a fall in that space one evening. So be careful !
Besides those points, it is an excellent place to stay, and knowing these things now I would stay there again .
Thanks !"

The ceilings are very high in the apartment and it feels very spacious. I loved the vintage decorating and the soothing color scheme. The kitchenette had everything you need for a short stay. The shower was spacious with great water pressure. It was perfect for my daughter and myself and we did appreciate the air mattress in the living space. The cooler below the apartment may be a little loud for the person sleeping in the living area where there is no door to muffle the noise.
We had a great stay, rested well, enjoyed the Reeder family, and were a little sad to leave the peace and quiet of their farm. We would love to stay again."

Stayed a few nights","The farm is alot bigger than we originally thought(it goes up this rolling green hilltop). The animals and garden there are very charming and sweet(they definitely lure you in) lol. When we stayed the veiws of foggy hill tops in the mornings are simply peaceful and beautiful. Very relaxing. There are no visitors aloud so we didn't explore the farm very much (we were visiting my sisters family).
The family there was also lovely when we met them.The only down side was, we were unaware we'd be staying in an efficiency apartment over the garage in the owners driveway. Tbh we thought it was a small cottage/cabin, and every patio the garage had was full of equipment and or junk so we had to sit or be in the main families areas. We love privacy and secluded airbnbs for our vacation stays, but other than that overall it was definitely beautiful"

Stayed a few nights","I had such an amazing time last year, i booked again. It felt like coming home.
You can tell a lot of thought went into setting up the loft. I didnt need anything, but a lot of supplies that might be easily forgotten were provided.
I was there for relaxation and some alone time, so I was very happy. It rained both full days I was there, but spent the time rocking on the covered porch area with a good book. Interacting with the animals was a great chance to be in nature.
If you are looking for fun and culture, there is a lot in the area. Good food, a local brewery, art, crafts and baked goods can be found.
The family is wonderful hosts. Very helpful if needed and are full of information. Thank you for sharing the farm with me for a few days."

I enjoyed walking around the property and petting the animals. I enjoyed meeting Brandon and Laura and their 4 kids! I got to watch the boys milk the cow and I got to watch Brandon do some of his Farrier work when a neighbor brought a horse by. Laura offered to share some of their dinner with me one night when there was a rainstorm. Very thoughtful and friendly people. The space was comfortable and private. I loved the shower- very spacious with both a nice rain shower head and a detachable hand held one. I visited the Ave Maria Grotto and I did the cave tour at the Rickwood Caverns State Park while I was there. Both were amazing! I wouldn’t hesitate to book here again and highly recommend to others.

Stayed a few nights","I cannot say enough about how special Revival Hills Farm is. From the time we stepped foot on the property we were welcomed and felt at home. We have a goal of owning our own farm one day so knowing they would allow us to join in on their day to day on their homestead was such a huge drawing point for me. I booked it as a surprise getaway for my husbands birthday knowing he would love the place but also love being able to learn and ask questions. Brandon let us help with farm chores, ask all of our questions, and even told us their story of Revival Hills. While we were there, we even got to watch them skin a rabbit their son had killed on their property (that they ate that night). We also got to watch their oldest two milk their family cow. What an amazing experience. It truly can be completely private or you can join in and have one of the best experiences of learning what it means to be self sufficient. For me, waking up and getting to walk to the pasture to see and be with all of the animals was so peaceful and renewing. Thank you for the amazing experience Reeder Family."

Laura and her children allowed us to interact with them to watch them milk the cow, but we were completely separate from them in our apartment (not attached to their home) and when roaming the farm, so it never felt like we didn't have complete privacy. We had a perfect, peaceful stay, and will recommend this place to anyone and can't wait to come back sometime!"

Stayed a few nights","I had an excellent time and wish I could have stayed longer. It was so nice to detach from the world and have a few days to enjoy peace and quiet.
The place is precious. It is decorated just beautifully and you get the farm feel. It was very clean and they provided many personal touches and items in case you left something at home.
I most enjoyed sitting under a huge tree in the middle of the pasture. I was visited by two if the sweetest horses I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. I have been around horses all my life but these were the most gentle and inquisitive ones I have ever encountered. They came to me and I petted them for every bit of 45 minutes.
I have zero complaints. They are very quick to reply and are very pleasant to interact with.
The farm is not far from town and I was able to do some shopping as well.
I hope to visit again. It is a true Airbnb gem."

It is very easy to explore the farm. The location was close enough to town but was far enough away for some peace and quiet. The check in process was very easy and the instructions for check out were easy, too! I would recommend this place because of the location, experience of being on a farm but mainly because the family is awesome, friendly and accommodating."

Just enough room for our crew, kids 6, 4 and 2 shared the pull out bed (good selection of movies and games provided) and we took the bedroom with travel bassinet for infant. Grabbed a pizza on our way in from Grumpy's and breakfast the next morning at Sunflower Bakery & Eatery. The hosts were more than gracious and great communicators. Our kids enjoyed getting to watch their kids milk their cow. Thr apartment is simple, gorgeous, and thoughtfully appointed with all you might need. Look forward to staying agian and have already recommended to friends."

It's clean, cozy, and a great place to reconnect with nature and witness the amazing animals God has created. Laura's kids were kind and gracious- we loved watching them due their daily chore of milking the cow.

The space is absolutely lovely and has everything you could need. Even the sofa bed is comfy- I know because my son thought it was SO cool made me sleep on it for two nights. Brandon described the farm as a labor of love as he graciously took time out of his busy day to let my son feed and pet the rabbits, and nothing could be more obvious. Kind people, friendly kids, dogs, chickens, horses, bunnies, cows, cats and a goat- what’s not to love? So lucky that they have chosen to share it!"

We were enamored with the quaint elegance of our little farmhouse and were very comfortable with the cozy furnishings and appreciative of the many thoughtful touches. I only wish that we were able to spend more time on the farm learning about the animals and farm life, but we certainly were in awe with the very detailed and structured life of living on a functional, organic farm.

Bonus… I discovered my grandfather (who I had never known) was buried less than a mile from the house. It started me checking my history! ❤️ It will always be a memorable vacation!"

Stayed a few nights","Sweet Home was a decent place to stay for our weekend away from home. It was very clean and homelike and I was glad to be in a quiet neighborhood.
There was an issue with the mattress in the MBR ; it had a hollowed-out space on one side which was aggravating.
Aside from that it was a pleasant place to stay.
The above is my overly sweet wife's opinion, but I will just say that the house was OK except for that horrible mattress in the master BR. I was most interested in getting a good nights sleep in or two night visit, we barely used the kitchen for anything, did not use the appliances, and left a VERY small footprint. I did not get a good nights sleep however, because of the GIANT hole in that mattress. It is no exaggeration to say that one literally rolled into it and it was an uphill battle to get out of it! The 2nd night we were forced to use just 1/2 of the bed. I feel ripped off because I paid over $400 for two nights and got little sleep."

BONUS there is an arcade machine in the kids bedroom, he has small patio out back and large front porch with rocking chairs. Fabio's is just like its pictured but it looks even better in person. If you are in the Alabama area book Fabio's place you will not be sorry."

If you plan on staying here, be advised that you should bring your own shampoo, conditioner, hand soap, body wash, Kleenex, laundry detergent, paper towels, etc. We suggest you bring towels and washcloths too if you plan on staying more than 2 nights, unless you have time to launder them. Also, please note that coffee, tea, and snacks were not provided by the host. We still enjoyed our stay very much and highly recommend it."

It was great to have a comfortable place to relax after spending a whole day at The Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament in Hanceville. The Ave Maria Grotto and St Bernard Abbey, which we visited the next day, is just minutes away! I was afraid there would not be many restaurant and shopping options in Cullman. Boy was I wrong. The 412 Public House had some of the best food of our entire trip. And Highway Pickers Antique Mall & Flea Market offered a great shopping experience. On the way back to Randle's Place, we stopped by Smith Farms. Wow, what a place. We ended up getting wine and cheese and crackers and smoked chicken to take back with us for an evening of snacks and card games. Overall, the stay was a great experience."

The kitchen is fully stocked - we cooked every meal at the house easily. Every moment in the house we found new appreciation for the decor and details. Even the colors - so well chosen and carefully done - on the ceiling even! So fun to see what design surprise we could find next. Staying there inspired me to redesign my house!
We had fun on the front porch, played in the yards front and back, and the living room was perfectly northern cozy. There’s a spare blanket or three in every room. Amazing coffee / tea supplies and even to-go gear for food and drinks. Delightful welcome items and note. Bathrooms fully stocked - right down to the colored bandaids. Very handy!
The kids cried when it was time to go.
We will return! ❤️"

Our stay was for a friend’s wedding at nearby Loft 212 and the bride enjoyed the Barbie suite for her last night as a single gal. It was perfect and we couldn’t have planned that any better.
We slept 2 couples comfortably and had a third couple to join us for Saturday night. Everyone had plenty of space. The men enjoyed watching football all day Saturday while the women were fully involved in wedding preparations at the venue.
I can’t say enough about this place. Wish I had another reason to come to Cullman so I had an excuse to stay again!"

The cottage is adorable and even better than we expected. We only used one bedroom but the bed was super comfortable. Shower has great water pressure and didn’t take long to warm up. We met the little neighbor boy while we were out playing with our cameras and drone and he was the sweetest, most polite little man. Very quiet place.
We definitely plan to return since it’s just a few hours drive there. And anyone staying here should check out Urban Cookhouse. They were amazing, and the leftovers were just as good the next night.
Brian was a very kind, responsive host and he made our first trip perfect."

Stayed a few nights","While the cottage is quaint and yet has modern appliances, there was a problem with the overhead light in the main bedroom that was undisclosed. Brian did offer to come cover up the light fixture that wouldn't turn completely off, but had we known, we would have selected the other bedroom. Tthe tub/shower fixtures and the tub itself are not yet completed installed which was a little disconcerting at first, but they worked perfectly. Overall, since we live in a similar type of home, we were fine with everything. I assume he will keep working on this location, it was warm, had all the amenities listed, was very clean and comfortable, in a good location for access to things around Cullman including Duck River. Its a work in process at this moment."

We didn’t encounter anything she could have been afraid of as the place was really clean but she’s a city girl LOL! The antique decor was nice. The only thing that wasn’t there, or we couldn’t find, was hand soap in the bathroom or a bar of soap for the shower. Beds were super comfortable! We would definitely stay here again."

Stayed with kids","The cozy stone cottage description is very accurate. It is convenient to town but rural. We felt safe knowing Brian was on site. It was not the optimal location for small kids as mentioned in the owners description. However the kids loved this little house.
There are spider webs at the windows as expected in a very old stone home the country. Brian had some great toys for the kids to use and was available to help me with remote control operations! The A/C worked great. Thanks again Brian."

Honestly, we had a really uneasy feeling staying here at some points, but we don’t have a specific reason why. All in all, we were happy to have a dog friendly place to stay with our sweet puppers."

Stayed a few nights","This was amazing way to get a peaceful weekend, the cottage felt like a home and it was super cozy. Great place if you want country living experience or cottagecore experience. We live in a tiny apartment so being able to get away to such a cozy and beautiful area was a breath of fresh air. Other than a few cobwebs the place was very clean, the linens smelt great, and all the surface areas and floors were clean. The kitchen has everything you need to cook any meals that you bring. He had an welcome basket filled with goodies and folder with information about the place and restaurants in the area. The kitchen fridge even had a few items like sodas and condiments. The bed, couches, and chairs were super comfy. The place smelt great. We didn't really get a chance to explore outside and take advantage of fire pit since it rained, but I'm sure it's great 👍 The host is welcoming and will answer any questions you might have. I will definitely consider coming back in the future. Thank you!"

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed our stay at the cottage. It was very convenient to our family we were visiting and we would definitely stay again. Our flight was delayed and so we arrived late. Brian had turned on the lights for us so it was welcoming when we arrived late at night. The cottage is rustic, but looks exactly like the pictures. It was clean and nicely decorated for the holidays. The beds were very comfortable. I did give 4 stars on the one of the categories as the website did make it appear as the whole place would be included. But there is someone on the back side of the house. It wasn't a problem but was strange if you are not expecting that so I would suggest updating the description to not say ""entire cottage..."" It did make it a little difficult to run a load a laundry as we were only there during the evening and could not run it then. We took a load to a family members house instead so not a big issue. But overall, we would stay again."

Stayed a few nights","Brian's place was decorated nicely for the holidays, and I did enjoy thoughtfully left treats as others mentioned. However, it was not shared in the description that this is not a private property. The AirBNB is the front portion of someone's home. Not really an issue as you rarely heard them, but was not what was expected. My biggest issue honestly was the smell of dog throughout and especially on the blankets. There were also cockroaches running around which made it difficult to relax.
I hate to leave a poor review but want to be honest with my experience here."

Inside he had breakfast ingredients in the fridge, snacks in a bowl and even a frozen pizza that my husband was excited about because we got in so late.
Beds were comfy, everything we needed in the kitchen to cook meals, and very clean home.
Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay while in town.
Great host and always reachable for questions!

I read another review from November 2022 that commented on the road construction and barking dogs, these are still occurring. It made it a little hard to get to the airbnb with blocked roads but that's out of the owner's control. The only negative to this place was as a non-smoker it smelled faintly of cigarettes, which could be coming from a neighbor's apartment or seeping through the paint from previous ownership. With the cleanliness and location, I am still planning on staying here again."

Stayed a few nights","I booked the apartment while on my way to Cullman and Jay approved the booking within only minutes. Access and directions to get inside were so easy. The apartment was very nice and very clean. Snacks and filtered water were provided as well as ice. Also provided were keurig pods, sugar and creamer as well as body lotion, bath gel, shampoo and conditioner. He even had a hair dryer! The bed was comfy and pillows were perfect! We will definitely stay again! Thanks, Jay!"

Stayed a few nights",This rental is located in a quiet residential neighborhood and is part of a single-story apartment four Plex. The offstreet parking is lighted with a motion detector white which I appreciated. It’s not a fancy location or unit but is well-maintained and clean. If back in the area I would stay there again.

Stayed a few nights","Jay was so friendly, and the space itself was very pleasant! The small touches like an already-filled filtered water pitcher and snacks on the coffee table truly elevated the stay, and made it seem more like a home. I'll definitely keep it in mind if I'm in the area again!"

Stayed with a pet",Jay is an excellent host. He has the perfect place to stay. The neighborhood is quiet and only 5min away from Walmart which is a big plus for me. Next door neighbors are super nice and didn't mind giving me directions to places around town. The apartment is very clean and cozy. We are definitely reserving it again next year.

Stayed a few nights","apartment is so clean and fully stocked for your stay... Jay takes the time to remember tiny little extras that make a BIG difference (neutrogena makeup removal wipes, toiletry items, dish liquid, and a bowl of snacks along with a fresh cold Brita pitcher full of water to quench your thirst from unloading your luggage. Southern hospitality at it's best! The only negative I can report is that there is not actually 2 queen beds.. the sofa has a recliner on each end and not really a place to sleep.... but it has Fast wifi, felt clean and comfortable, and check in was a breeze.... what more could you honestly ask for at this price point.... book it. you wont regret it."
