Stayed about a week","Green Gables was amazing! Tastefully decorated yet homey and Ann provided anything you might need and extras. She provides all nice high-end appliances (including washer, dryer and detergent), comfy beds, bedding, games to play and even some nice snacks, coffee and water. There was plenty of storage area for our unpacked items and luggage. The kitchen is beautiful! It's nicely and clearly marked with what is in each drawer and cabinet which made finding what we needed easily. My grandkids loved sleeping in the attic bedroom that has two twin beds. All bathrooms had an abundance of nice fluffy towels and bath products. Ann made herself available should we need anything. Although all my family did not make it to Indiana, this AIRBNB is so roomy it can hold 10 people easily. We enjoyed sitting and rocking in the chairs on the front porch. This home is beautiful inside and out. We will certainly return to Green Gables when we have the opportunity to return to the Bluffton area."

Stayed with kids","Ann was easy to communicate with, and her place has everything you could need to be comfortable.
We had 3 generations staying in the space, and it was perfect. Nana and Papa had their own room with access to the walk in shower. The “kids” each had their own comfortable rooms, and the “grands” had choices for sleeping accommodations on the same level or up on the next level. The play space in the basement was perfect for the grands to get into safe mischief.
The kitchen is amazing - Nana was cooking at the stove as I was loading dishwasher and 2 grands chased each other on their way to the fridge - all without bumping into each other!
Everything was labeled and easy to find, and we couldn’t think of anything to suggest to add for future guests.
We are already talking about planning our next getaway at Green Gables next year!"

Stayed a few nights","We stayed at Ann’s home to watch the eclipse. The home was spotless! I can’t begin to talk about how clean the home was. The furnishings were beautiful. The appliances were top of the line. The beds were very comfortable. The patio was a wonderful space to relax and enjoy the eclipse. Everything you could think of was provided, bathroom supplies, kitchen supplies, and many different snacks and coffee options. We were there the weekend of the NCAA Final Four and Championship tournaments and the streaming capabilities of the internet and TVs was wonderful. Ann was very responsive and helpful. The home is in a cute neighborhood and the neighbors are very friendly. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and if we are in the area again, we would definitely stay at Ann’s home again. If I could give this home double the 5 star rating, I would!"

Stayed a few nights","I’ve stayed in many airbnbs and this has to be one of, if not THE best airbnbs I’ve stayed. Completely unexpected gem when traveling to Bluffton, Indiana. Spacious. Clean. Immaculate amenities. All the cabinets and drawers being labeled was also a touch that I didn’t think would be important but it feels needed at every airbnb now. Our host even called to help when she noticed our truck broken down. Great spot. Great host. Would stay again!"

Stayed with kids",What a place. It is common for Airbnbs to not be as nice as they appear on pictures. This one is the other way around. It would be hard to say enough good. Very well supplied. Very communicative host. Just a good clean Airbnb. It is close to the crossroads - which can make a little noise - if that happens to bother you. Just typical small town feel...

Stayed a few nights","I stay in at least a dozen Air bnbs a year while working out of town. I think Air is too loose with their “superhost” labeling as few ever meet the “super” moniker.
This one of Ann’s truly is super. She has thought of everything in a freshly remodeled and up to date property.
I would absolutely stay at Ann’s place again in the future and you should too.
I’d like to nominate Ann as the inaugural “ultra host” when Air gets around to making it."

Very clean, clear instructions for checkout... not to mention a welcome basket with snacks & labeled cabinets! Finding the things we needed in the kitchen was a breeze with all of the labels. SO appreciated.
The home was absolutely gorgeous and had enough separated space to accommodate our friends and their families. We look forward to renting the space in the future!"

Stayed with kids","We (myself, hubby, daughter, son-in-law, and 3 kids aged 1-5) stayed in Ann’s house while in Bluffton for a family event. Ann’s house was spacious and beautifully decorated, with comfortable furnishings. Ann has thought of everything to make visitors’ stays enjoyable. My grandsons were thrilled with the playroom in the basement, as well as the finished attic space to explore. Lots of room for the family to spread out and for the kids to play. Beds were comfortable for sleeping, and there are room-darkening shades on the bedroom windows which we all appreciated! The kitchen was fully stocked with all items needed to cook a meal - can’t think of anything that we needed that wasn’t supplied! We all hope that when we come back for future family events, that Ann’s house will be available!"

Ann has thought of everything; soft throw blankets all over the house, spare toiletries, first aid kits, a wonderfully stocked kitchen, games and toys for the kids, the list goes on and on.
Ann was very responsive and gave us great recommendations for local restaurants. We were staying at Ann’s place as part of my daughter’s 12th birthday celebration, and Ann had a birthday card waiting for her on the counter when we arrived. It was a lovely weekend with great memories made at Ann’s beautiful home. Thank you so much, Ann!"

Stayed with kids","Green Gables was a gem. Beautifully remodeled home right on Main Street. Sound was not a problem and privacy glass on the doors and the blackout window shades in the bedrooms made it feel very private. Attached garage was convenient and two parking spots outside as well. Ann really thought of every amenity you could need. Plenty of towels, clean linens, bathroom necessities if you forgot anything, fully supplied kitchen, coffee bar, even folding luggage racks in the closets. Everthing was also extremely clean. My kids really enjoyed the games and toys she had available. Ann was extremely responsive and offered several times to help us with anything we needed. If you are visiting the parks and attractions nearby, stay here! And if you get a chance, read Ann's story in her house info binder, very inspiring."

This is especially helpful when stores are closed and you need a cup of tea or a quick meal. There are toys for the children and games for the family to play. Too bad we didn’t get a chance to use the firepit - maybe on our next visit to Decatur.

Group trip","We all had a wonderful time staying at Arcadia Place! The location was super easy to find and only minutes from town! The duplex was beautiful and spacious. There was enough room for the seven of us to comfortably hang out together whether it be in the kitchen, living room, or outside and still be able to retreat to our own spaces at the end of the night. The only thing I wish we had known ahead of time was how sensitive the fire alarm was. Otherwise we had a wonderful stay, and were so grateful to find a place that resembles home while we were away from home 🙂"

Group trip","We travel full time, coast to coast, as touring musicians. Jessica's home in Decatur was one of our top stays. Jessica has created a wonderful respite that was much appreciated by our family (5 adults) while on-the-road between performances. Our time was necessarily brief but this would be a lovely location by those seeking accommodations for longer periods of time. We were able to cook our supper and although the dining area was beautiful and spacious we took our meal outside to the picnic table to enjoy the fresh air and song birds. We took a walk down the country road just as it was getting dark and recharged our spirits with the fireflies twinkling over the prairie grasses. A big storm blew through but we felt safe and comfortable inside and Jessica even messaged us to make sure we were ok and had power - we were!"

Stayed with kids","Where do I begin! This place is like HOME. There were things this home had that I didn't even think about. I traveled with my elderly parents, my brother and my daughter and it was comfortable for us all. After coming from a funeral it was comfortable for us to relax and enjoy ourselves. It was so peaceful and warm during these cold days. There are plenty of blankets to feel nice and cozy and watch the big TV on the couch. I cooked full meals in the well equipped kitchen. My favorite part was the Sega Genesis game console, i felt like a kid again. Me and my 7 year old had some good times playing it our first night. There is literally nothing this home lacked. There were snacks waiting for us when we arrived. Jessica was great with communicating and prompt. This was my parents first experience at an air bnb and they were impressed. I've stayed at several in many different states and i would have to say this is my favorite. Thank you so much Jessica!"

There were some toys for the little ones. A pack and play for the baby. And breakfast for the morning. She responded immediately while we were planning our trip. Couldn't ask for a better host.

Way better than a hotel and very economical. We will definitely stay again."

The bath was spotless and came with quality linens and plentiful bath products. Great AC. The property is located across the street from the Berne clocktower with splashpad and glockenspiel; farmer's market also across the street on Saturdays. Woke up to the gentle sound of a passing horse and buggy - very charming stay. Thank you, Lana, for your warm welcome to Berne!"

The kitchen was stocked with all the utensils that we needed to cook breakfast the next morning.
Oversized tub was a huge plus! And the tv with streaming services was a bonus for us.
We did run into an issue with the remote not working but Lana responded quickly and sent someone to fix it. And we also ended up locking ourselves out and she quickly resolved that issue too!
Definitely a cute cozy house that can accommodate 2-8 people easily!"

Stayed a few nights","What a lovely place to stay! Quiet street and neighborhood. Just a short walk to downtown. Well equipped, cozy and comfortable! My only disappointment was no internet. The category ""Internet and Office"" in the listing threw me. It did say no WiFi so I thought the internet was through an ethernet cable. Since this was a working vacation, I needed to work elsewhere. That really altered my plans since I was dependent on relatives and friends for transportation. The hosts Amber and Megan are quick to respond to questions. I throughly enjoyed my stay!"

Group trip","Pros: Beautiful house inside and out. Clean and nice updates throughout. Didn’t hear any complaints about the beds. Host is very responsive and has put a lot of thought into the place. Overall, my group had a lot of good things to say about the place itself
Things to ponder: There are trains nearby that you can hear pretty well in the house. Could have been worse but I feel like it’s worth mentioning since I didn’t notice any noise alerts on the posting. And lastly, there’s a list of check out instructions (towels started, trash collected/taken out, dishwasher, etc.) also not mentioned in the listing until after booking. Again, not really a big deal but it’s nice to know ahead of time."

Stayed with kids","My family had a lovely weekend stay at Central House celebrating my mother’s 65th birthday together. The house is really beautiful and we loved how close it was to downtown, to the path next to the river, and to the state park.
The hosts were great. They were very communicative and available, both leading up to our stay and during it. They were accommodating and helpful. We appreciated that they came promptly after a snow and cleared the driveway, sidewalks, etc.
Just a note that there is just one full bathroom on the main level and it is not connected to the main bedroom (though it is right next to it). This was not at all an issue for our family but I could see how someone might mistake that based on the listing."

The location was very convenient for what all we needed to do while in Decatur. I liked the eco-friendly approach to running her AirB&B. Amber’s mission for helping people in Haiti was nicely displayed throughout the home. She has written a touching and informative story that is in a binder on the dining room desk…a must read. 🥰"

We were in Decatur when it was unusually warm and the house did not have AC. The ceiling fans helped and the floor fan Amber provided was helpful.
I am a tea drinker and the tea kettle was right on the counter making it easy for me to start my day. Everything worked out well for us. Thank you for allowing us to use your home."

There was also a big playground set and trampoline that the kids loved!! We would love to come back in the near future!! Lexy and her family were very kind and welcoming. (Also, the pool has an automatic cover which gave us peace of mind when the pool was closed when we weren't swimming!)"

Stayed with kids","This property is gorgeous inside and out. We were free to use the pool and play in the yard whenever we wanted. The basement apartment and being outside felt private despite the owners being there. There weren’t any other people in sight! My phone had no reception in the apartment and the WiFi didn’t work well. It was surprising because I never go anywhere with spotty internet connection, but ended up being ok because it forced me off my phone, left me without Netflix, and untemped to throw the kids in front of the tv instead of playing and dancing with them. I would def stay again! If there were a hot tub outdoors, I’d book a few nights this winter to take in the gorgeous sunsets to the west which will be even more delightful once the trees are bare. Thanks for being great hosts!"

The internet and cell phone coverage is spotty but I was still able to work with a few internet service interruptions while I was there.
I will say that if you're looking for quiet solitude, this isn't the place for you as there are small children on the premises that do what small children do. Otherwise if that doesn't bother you, I would highly recommend staying here."

We had our one year old with us, and they had everything for her as well - pack n play, high chair, toys - we didn't have to bring a thing. The pool was gorgeous and well maintained, it was so nice to lounge in the pool all day. The wifi/cell service can be spotty, so it may be hard if you need to do something with internet service. However, it was nice to be a bit more disconnected. Would definitely recommend a stay!"

Stayed a few nights","This trip was a Mother's Day Sabbatical for me. I did not want to leave!
10 minutes away, and en route to Jessica's place, I picked up a few simple groceries from Walmart. Once I arrived, I wanted for nothing. I only left when I had to.
I loved the layout of the apartment. Everything was just a few steps away. A fun activity - Jessica has placed eye candy throughout the rooms. Finding different pieces was an adventure.
The bed was comfortable and the blankets available to add were soft and cozy. The shower was relaxing and the water pressure was perfect.
For me, the location couldn't have been better. Even though I only live 35 minutes away, since I don't get to Decatur often, it felt like a real getaway. However, it was only a 25-minute drive to church on Sunday and work on Monday. Checkout was simple and quick. I cannot wait to come back! I truly would love to live there!"

I appreciated the attention to detail that was displayed throughout. There were snacks in the kitchen, games in the living room, and cozy throws in a basket. Our visit was brief, but Jessica's place gave us everything we wanted--a clean and comfortable place for a meal, with well-cared for green space outside where we could sit and watch the sky (we were there to experience totality during the eclipse).
Jessica was friendly and informative throughout the reservation process. She always responded very quickly to my questions and accommodated our timing needs. The apartment is attractively decorated and updated for comfort (new windows, nice cupboards, and such). I don't think you could go wrong here. I recommend Jessica's place highly."

Cute little coffee bar set up with just about anything you’d want. She had both a drip coffee maker and a Keurig which was nice. The sofa and the chairs were comfortable, and I think it was the best night sleep I’ve had in months. When we first approached I thought that it might be a little noisy because it’s close to a four-way stop. But honestly once I was inside I never heard a thing and there’s very little traffic in the area. It was a pleasant evening and we wanted to go for a walk. Just across the street was a really nice trail that wound through a neighborhood around a lake. It was really beautiful and so I did it again in the morning before we left. I would highly recommend this place."

Stayed a few nights","This Airbnb is the perfect place to stay at if you were at or around Decatur Indiana. It feels like the tardis, where it’s much bigger on the inside. The space, new kitchen it seems, and everything else just had an updated field to it. I will always look for this place if I’m in the area needing a place to stay from this point forward!"

It was such a great location and we enjoyed being able to join others at the Clock Tower park to witness the full eclipse. The house being in such great location and so homey and welcoming was just icing on the cake. The house is very well appointed with everything we needed. As children of a collector we appreciated the eclectic decor. We felt right at home. The house has a nice layout for multiple guests. We wish we could have stayed longer to check out the town more but now that we’ve had our first experience there we hope to return and stay at Chris’s house again.

It’s also loud and bright at night. Blackout shades would be helpful and we had air plugs to help with the street noise. Very cute place and we love the space. The location is great with many walkable eating options nearby. Be prepared for the stairs- they are mentioned in the listing and definitely not for anyone who might have mobility issues. Thanks for a great alternative to a hotel!

Hosts very responsive and give local recommendations.
The space is as described and very clean.
Nice bathroom and shower
Temperature control is consistent.
Nice decor
Cons:
Sits on Main Street so there is a lot of street noise.
Small island area to eat if several occupants
Small college type refrigerator with very little room and no ice maker.
Overpriced: I don’t stay at a lot if air Bnb and this is nice space but compared to others of similar quality I feel it to be overpriced secondary to reasons listed above."

The curtains in the bedroom need to be blackout, it’s very bright at night because you are downtown. I also didn’t realize the bedrooms are separated by a roller barn door so there was not full privacy. Paper plates, bowls and plastic silverware are what you’ll get. They did a great job with renovations and the place was very clean."

We had some internet issues and needed to tether to our phones for tv 2 evenings. There is some traffic noise with it being above a Main Street storefront so keep that in mind if you are sensitive to noise at night. And if you grab some food to go, request your utensils and plates from the restaurant as they are not provided. There are coffee mugs and water glasses however. Highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","Book it now. We have family in Decatur and visit every summer. This Downtown location is perfect, and is right next door to the Java Bean. A fairly large upstairs space that's been nicely updated, with two very clean street-side bedrooms, good wireless and tv service, and an excellent shower. The entry doors are solid, with a solid keypad entry that worked flawlessly. I was able to park overnight directly in front of the door on the street.
Decatur is a very, very safe town, and the surrounding towns (I'm a Berne fan) and Adams county itself are very fun to explore.
As other reviews point out, expect steep entry steps and a freestanding room A/C unit for summer months.
Joann and Mark are excellent hosts with prompt communication and obvious pride in this home. Highly Recommended!"

If the owners keep adding little touches and upgrades this will be a premier spot to stay in downtown Decatur Indiana and we would stay here again and again
Drawback number one
Climbing a lot of stairs is not for people with heart troubles or elderly ( stairs seem to be 8"" between stair treads)
Drawback number two
No Black out curtains in the bedrooms street lights keep room to bright for light sleepers
Drawback three no central air or heating but i will assume that is something they are working on
Overall its a very good stay and will most likely stay there again in the future"

It's downtown and close to tons of restaurants and bars. But, the bar traffic late at night can get kind of loud. Also, as far as I know, you don't have a specific parking spot. There is parking behind the building and in front on the side of the road. There are two doors to the room. One is at ground level and the other is up the flight of stairs. Getting luggage up the stairs is a bit of a chore, but not bad. Also, the hosts didn't send me the code to get in the doors. I had to call to get it. I think they thought they had already sent it but they must have forgotten. Another strange thing, you don't have control over the A/C or heat. I'm not sure where the controls are, but I read a review that the salon downstairs controls it. There is a personal unit in the living room for A/C and heat but it doesn't affect the temperature much. It was 30 degrees out during out stay and we slept without the covers on. It was pretty warm in the room. I wish we could've change the temp. Overall good stay with some quirks!"

Stayed one night",The apartment is newly remodeled and very nicely done. Everything was clean and bed was comfy. There really is no kitchen so you better plan to eat out every meal. There is a dorm fridge and small microwave only. Located on the main drag in Decatur on the same street as several bars. Be prepared to be awake until 3 am. Too noisy to sleep on a Friday night. And you can’t control the heat or AC. Both are tied into the salon downstairs which only the owner can control. A space heater and portable ac unit are provided. And no door or divider between the 2 bedrooms. All of these items should have been divulged in the listing but were not.

Just know the a/c for the apartment is a portable unit that vents out the window in the biggest bedroom . It is loud, keeps the bedroom very cool but the bathroom at the opposite end of the place gets a little warm.
I did not make the reservation until about 11:30 am and he had us in the unit by 3:30. We really appreciated that. Also there were some snack items and also beverages in the refrigerator. Nice Coffee Shop downstairs too!"

I had been leery of the second floor location due to knee & balance issues and of being in someone’s home but needed to be close to friends I was visiting for a graduation weekend. I was prepared to make multiple trips up the staircase to get all my belongings up there but Kristina carried my suitcase up which made it so much easier for me. I also needed to iron a blouse and she set up an ironing board & steam iron for me. The whole upstairs has 3 BR, 1 bath, and a sitting room. If only one person, as I was, is staying, none of the other rooms are rented out. You have complete privacy. The bed is quite comfortable and the room was charming. The bathroom has been updated and everything was clean. This was a lovely, clean, quiet, and convenient stay. Thank you!"

Her home is absolutely beautiful, immaculately clean, all the privacy you could ever ask for and she is absolutely gracious and so considerate of any need you may have. Berne is also beautiful and so clean, and there are so many nice little towns and tons of walking trails to chose from and lakes close by. Don't miss this gem if you get the chance."

Stayed a few nights","Our three nights' stay - under extreme winter conditions - was providential. We were attending a funeral in Bluffton and needed the isolation of an old, two-story farmhouse on a wind-swept, frozen, fallow corn field to complement our grief. We were very grateful for the huge, attached garage: protection for our SUVs. The propane gas furnace did all it could to keep the open spaces in the house habitable, while making the bed- and- bathrooms toasty-warm behind closed doors ...
We very much look forward to returning some happier day."

Group trip","We really enjoyed our stay at this quiet farmhouse. We had a family group stay here as we were in town for a family wedding. The house is exactly as described. In addition, it is very clean and well stocked with basic amenities. Our only regret is that we did not have the time to stay longer. The property is beautiful and we would’ve loved to have had an outdoor fire and done some stargazing. We did enjoy sitting on the front porch and just enjoying our space. It fit our needs perfectly. The large table in the kitchen was perfect for our meals as well as some evening card playing. The house has one TV, which is small, but that is not why we were there so not an issue for us. If you want the house to watch some big game, maybe this isn’t the house for you but if you want some quiet and serenity and comfort, it is the place for you."

Stayed with kids","The house and yard are very spacious and this was a great location for traveling with our 3-year-old. We were just in the area to visit with family, so this was definitely better than staying in a hotel. Oh, and the bed I slept in (upstairs room with bathroom) was super soft and I slept like a baby (until the toddler woke me up at 6 am). No cable but there’s 16 channels pulled in from the antenna, and no Wifi, but it was easily fixable with a hotspot from your cell phone. Love the kitchen table, and my son loved the little tractors and slide. Perfect yard for soccer too."

Group trip","The Quiet Country Farmhouse is correctly named. Very quiet, peaceful and comfortable. In the country, but still close enough to shopping and restaurants. Communication between Stephanie / Ryan and myself was great, they responded very quickly and were extremely accommodating to our travel changes. Definitely a highly recommended home to stay in."

Stayed a few nights",Had a wonderful time at Stephanie and Ryan's house. The house is immaculate and in a great spot it's nice and quiet. Only complaint would be the house has no WiFi which was very minor. Overall I would absolutely stay there again.

Group trip","This was my second time staying at this peaceful house. One of the two bathrooms had an issue, but the host had a repair man fix it in a timely manner. Overall, things went smoothly! I invited Ryan and Stephanie to visit the building I was working on, and they came with their kids. It was great to meet all of them!"

Stayed a few nights","We really enjoyed our stay this past weekend at Ryan and Stephanie's place. We arrived late evening, but didn't have any trouble finding the home since all the lights had been turned on. It was raining when we arrived, so we were very grateful when we found that the garage door had been left open for us to pull our vehicle into. We very much appreciated their hospitality!"

Stayed about a week","Country house about 15min from town. No rush-hour traffic. No traffic at all... Very responsive hosts - I needed to change my reservation mid-stay and they accommodated within hours! Read the description; it’s accurate.
I will be returning here."

Stayed a few nights","Stephanie and Ryan were amazing host. They went above and beyond to accommodate my family on such short notice without hesitation. Stephanie literally responded immediately after I pressed send message : )) . This was my first time using Airbnb, therefore, I didn't know what to expect, but staying at Stephanie and Ryans' home relieved my fears and I will most definitely return on my next trip to Ft Wayne. The home was immaculate with a nice country feel. There is a Dollar General, gas station and very inexpensive restaurant (Richard's) only about 4 minutes away. I highly recommend staying at Stephanie and Ryans'."

Stayed with kids","The whole family found this an absolutely delightful place to stay, very repeatable and recommendable! A lovely, homey country setting, a little farther from stores than what we’re used to, but not too far. The kitchen is well-equipped and the kitchen/dining area very spacious for a family or group. The cleanliness and special touches were appreciated, like the candle burning when we arrived. The hosts are gracious and hospitable, quick to respond to our questions. There is a great porch and yard that we hope to enjoy, as well, in the future when it’s warmer."

Stayed a few nights","Staying at Stephanie and Ryan's house was exactly what we hoped it would be. We were working in the area and tried their place instead of getting a hotel. Private, easy check-in, lots of space (including a garage), many amenities, and Stephanie even made us home-made cookies! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone traveling in the area, who wants some peace and quiet."

Group trip","The home was better than expected - very clean, updated nice kitchen/dining room and cozy living room. Bedrooms were perfect for families, queen downstairs and 3 bedrooms upstairs for kids with a bathroom. Communication with Stephanie and Ryan was super easy, even on a day they were busy with a family celebration. Very peaceful location, even had a swingset for kids. If we are anywhere near Ft. Wayne in need of an overnight, this is 1st on my list of places to book."

Group trip",The house was big and roomy and clean which made for any excellent stay. I would gladly stay there again and would recommend this place to any family visiting the Fort Wayne area. We were able to get from the Coliseum to the house in 15 minutes with no traffic. Once at the house we felt relaxed to be secluded away from the city. Definitely worth the price.
