Stayed with kids",WOW! That was all of my families first reaction walking into Nikki's place. 10 out of 10! Everything was wonderful and so beautifully decorated. Nikki's place was fully stocked with everything you'll possibly need! beds were comfortable as well as pillows. The space was roomy. My family absolutely enjoyed all the games she provided and they now wants us to purchase them. The games are brand new so hopefully other guests take care of the games for future guests to enjoy 😉 Best Mother's Day gift to me! I will definitely return when I'm visiting the area again. Thank you Nikki

This house is in a beautiful historic neighborhood. The host has done and amazing job at restoring and updating the house while keeping 100% of the charm. Would recommend this house to everyone!

Stayed with kids","This location was perfect for our family (myself, husband and two yr old). It’s within walkable distance to the memorial children’s park my family always visits when in Tyler. And close to the city park. The hospital is less than four minutes away. You do hear helicopters, but it’s expected due to the close proximity of the hospital but also it’s an opportunity to pray for the occupants and be grateful for your health. The home itself is so charming and welcoming. It felt like our home the minute we walked in. There’s lots of antique/vintage interior elements to explore, like a hideaway vintage ironing board in the bedroom and phone. There’s a wonderful selection of vinyls for the music lover located in the living room. Along with lots of soft blankets and a ridiculously comfortable velvet sofa. The king bed became a haven and has a down feather comforter which, if you’ve never slept with one, you’re missing out. My family and I will most assuredly chose this location again!!!"

It’s very close to downtown and some good local eateries. The furniture was all very comfortable, the home was spacious, and everything was in good working order. Only issue we had was the bath tub not draining. Great place for couples to stay or a family since there is a pull out couch which we didn’t utilize."

Stayed one night","Jennifer's place, ""The Tyler Rose"" is the sister of ""The Peacock,"" where we stayed this past June. Everything at the ""Rose"" was great: decor, comfort and style. The king size bed is awesome and the large, traditional bath/shower washed all stress and road fatigue away. A unique feature to the ""Rose"" is the larger side patio for outside lounging, weather accommodating. The house and the neighborhood has a palpable feel of comfort and peace. In a addition to partaking of Bruno's Pizza (fantastic again) and True Vine Brewery (also fantastic again), we enjoyed a morning brew at the Foundry Coffeeshop, yet another discovered Rose City gem. We remain steadfast in our decision to go through Tyler rather than Dallas on future trips. We hope to stay at the Tyler Rose or The Peacock every time."

My daughter and I had the best weekend get away and what made it so special was the detail and unique surroundings of our accommodations. Jennifer has thought of everything and from how immaculate and spotless her home is to that amazing bed! I cannot say enough! Jennifer was so responsive with any questions and even let us check in early! Even when there was a power outage / to no fault of anyone but our Texas heat!! - Jennifer was prompt and even refunded our money for the 2nd night when we decided to head home. And this was after giving us a HUGE discount to stay a 2nd night since there was a rare opening!!! I absolutely cannot wait to visit again and stay at the Tyler Rose! I have already shared this gem with so many friends and families!

Stayed a few nights","Jennifer's place a great getaway for the weekend. It was clean and cozy. She was proactive in making sure we were comfortable.
Only issue was lights coming on or going off everytime the neighbor (its a duplex) turned theirs off or on. The lights are remote controlled and apparently on the same frequency.
I am still giving 5 stars because Jennifer has already made plans to have electrician work out the kink or switch fixtures in one of the sides.
Also the location is great being only a few minutes from the square and maybe 10 from the zoo!"

It was the perfect little cottage style home, with everything you need to either cook a meal and lounge at home or sneak away to some fabulous restaurants and relax on the back porch.
A nice touch of home my husband and I loved was the puzzle and games available.. it was a wonderful and unexpected touch that felt like home.
Jennifer was very responsive and answered every question I had. She have some wonderful recommendations a few days before we even arrived so we could plan ahead.
I highly recommend this home, Jennifer is an impeccable host!"

Shampoo, conditioner, body and hand soaps were all high quality and not overly scented. Kitchen well equipped, we did not use the oven/stove or microwave. Dining area is spacious for 4 people in a home of this size, same for the living room. We appreciated the beautiful art in these spaces as well, very much added to the charm of staying in Tyler in a bungalow. Hosts were wonderful and answered any and all questions in a timely manner. This is a duplex, you may hear guests next door if it's occupied, this is expected and not unreasonable.

100% will book again if we plan to stay in Tyler. No need to second guess this spot. Great location."

Stayed with kids","I’ve been to fancy airbnbs’ but this humble home tops them all! Host paid attention to every detail of the house, literally, for his visitors. Living room has clean furniture, nice decor, huge TV, well equipped kitchen, clean bathrooms with plenty of wash clothes, towels, liquid body wash, shampoo & conditioner. Shower curtain in master out-of-this-world! Took note for my home. Host is responsive & must have a great cleaning crew. Laundry area is on the opposite side of the bedrooms, past the kitchen with detergent provided. There’s a door to close out the bedroom side of the house from the living room & kitchen areas - I believe for privacy. Weather was cold in Tyler - heater worked great, slept nice and cozy. Home has 4 beds in 3 beautifully decorated bedrooms - 1 king & 3 queens - all with the most comfy memory foam mattresses! We got the link to get for our home. There’s white clean linen & walk-in closets in all bedrooms. 2-sink vanity in master bath. Safe neighborhood. Thanks!"

We fixed this by borrowing a lamp from one of the bedrooms and setting it up on the foyer table. This worked well for us."

The house is roomy and comfy, with a large table for dining, and a devoted work space which I didn't see in pictures. The large frig has plenty of room for your groceries, and Stacey provided a bag of chips and a jar of salsa for our snacking pleasure. Easy entrance with a code. Even the steep driveway wasn't an issue for our big SUV. We enjoyed it very much and would stay again if we go back to that area.
Thanks, Stacey!"

Stayed a few nights","We were there for an event at UT Tyler and the house was perfect. It was close to campus and provided space for our daughter to come to the house to visit, play games and unwind. Beds were comfortable and the kitchen had what we needed for supplies. The only challenge, if any, was the drive way to the carport was steep and the car’s safety features did not like it. It triggered the collision sensors. So, if you have a long car, or a low car, that could be an issue. But it that is the only negative, it is a great place to stay."

The neighborhood is beautiful, safe, and quiet, yet close to anything you could possibly need. Communication was excellent. When we arrived, it was after dusk, but there were a few lights left on to make the home look so welcoming as we pulled up. After a long day of travel, we appreciated not having to stumble around in the dark.

Stayed with kids","Stacey and her local hostess, Angie, are exceptional!! Stacey did a wonderful job of communicating with me throughout our stay. Once we knew we would be arriving late, Angie, went to the home and turned on the lights for us and gave us a door code for us to use.
In Stacey’s home there are many amenities for you to enjoy including new memory foam mattresses, comfortable sheets and towels, washer/dryer and a well equipped kitchen. The natural light coming through the windows created a warm, inviting space to relax in.
We enjoyed staying at Stacey’s house and look forward to another stay in the future!"

We loved the feeling of seclusion being off of the road and out of sight of the highway, but with the home of the owner near by we had a sense of security. At the same time we were given our privacy. The sheep and the dogs were fenced in. They were curious but friendly. Lydia responded quickly to my questions via texts. I would suggest bringing your own snacks, food and drinks so you don't have to leave once settled."

Stayed a few nights","Such a cute cottage! It was a very peaceful stay, and we enjoyed how far set back it is from the road! It definitely felt like a mini vacation in the woods, but we still had the convenience of town only 15-20 minutes away! I recommend taking your own drinking water because there wasn’t a water filter pitcher to fill, or a jug of water anywhere. And the tap water isn’t filtered. So that was the only downside of the stay. We tried to drink the tap water, but it had a strong chlorine taste, so we ended up buying a ton of water for us to drink during our stay."

Stayed with a pet","Cana cottage was the perfect little spot to enjoy the pines and nature of Tyler. It’s a good spot to stay if you want the nature feel but still a short car ride to coffee shops and downtown Tyler. Lydia was very responsive and communicative. Both her and her husband were very nice and friendly! Everything was exactly as pictured in the ad. My dog and I really enjoyed taking walks on property, up and down the long gravel drive way and we enjoyed watching the sheep in the evening! I also really like that Lydia had a bible in the space and had it turned to Luke. I ended up reading the book of Luke for the weekend. I would def return. I will say, the rooster does crow at alllll hours of the day and night- sometimes at 2 am. So if this is something that bothers you, I would be mindful. But there is absolutely nothing else I would change. I had a wonderful stay!"

These are working dogs and they do seem fairly young, so one of them was following the car as we went up the drive and we were a bit nervous/scared because we didn’t want to hurt them on accident. We drove up the driveway slowly and when I let Lydia know about it she was helpful and kind. The area is quiet and cozy, perfect for a getaway!"

There was some wildlife that added excitement to our evenings, but we didn't feel any danger, just noises in the woods. The cottage is perfectly done in build, layout and cleanliness. We loved the decorations and amenities. Lydia responded to my inquiries nearly instantaneously in a clear and pleasant manor. Their sweet dog, Roxy, is such a character. We loved her wagging tail greeting us each time we drove up to the cottage. She treated us and our dog as if we were welcome to her home anytime. We will stay here again in the future as needed and recommend it to others."

Stayed about a week","Cana cottage was well appointed and matched Lydia and Weston’s description.
The cottage was just lovely with thoughtful furnishings, a comfortable bed and quality amenities and necessities. The hosts were in the process of clearing some wooded area on their property for a short walking trail which will be a very nice addition to their property across a small creek that is already there.
I really enjoyed watching the sheep and cows on their property and interacting with their very friendly Great Pyrenees dog, Roxy.
There were some unfortunate disturbances and disruptions during my stay which unfortunately made my trip shorter than desired but
Lydia and Weston and were very kind, understanding and flexible in remedying the issues at hand.
They both take great care of providing a welcoming atmosphere for their guests
and are really wonderful and caring hosts. Thank you, Weston and Lydia for your hospitality."

The spaces were an amazing blend of classic Texas ranch, light and bright contemporary, and modern farm house with a touches of colorful artwork.
There were 8 of us with 4 adults and 4 teenage boys. There was plenty of room for everyone to spread out. The boys spent most of the time playing ping pong and pool. The adults enjoyed the light and airy sitting room by day and bistro style patio in the evenings.
Jen was a fantastic host. She was incredible prompt and had amazingly clear instructions for everything."

The living room had a nice sectional sofa and the dining area had very comfortable chairs where we played games.
The location was very close to shopping and restaurants.
It was a little close to a busy street which made it noisy if you wanted to sleep past 8:00 am.
I would definitely recommend this place and hope to rent it again."

The instructions given to get there and inside were crystal clear and most helpful. The place itself is remarkable. Clean, minimalistic, and so much charm. The exposed brick walls were gorgeous. The huge floor to ceiling windows looking over the downtown area were perfect for watching the nightlife as well as the beginning of a new day. The double shower is a must use and the skylight above it was on point. The bed was super comfy. The robes were ultra fluffy. Ceilings fans, ac, nightlights, amazing smelling body care, wine glasses, etc..so many well thought out details for a perfectly romantic stay. Yes, you can hear music and cars and sirens and people-but that’s all part of the downtown vibe!! Book it. You won’t regret it. Except if you have mobility issues or lots of heavy luggage-cuz them stairs are a workout."

Stayed one night","So let’s skip past the obvious… the space is cool. Exposed brick walls, dramatic windows, super cool velvet green couch… just yes all around. But what they didn’t show you in the photos are the truly hidden gems of the space… vaulted ceilings, uniquely stunning internal architecture, a skylight that illuminates the kitchen in the mornings…and literally the best naturally occurring architectural acoustics I have found in my travels! And beyond all of that… it is clear that every piece of this space was done with intention… you know you’re being invited into a space that is loved and crafted with thought. It’s just a cool space. I will likely stay again when I visit Tyler. The bar next door is great… plus you can crank up your music unapologetically with a bar next door! Definitely use the robes if you stay they are amazingly soft and the dual shower is fun even as a solo traveler… personally, I went for hot water on one side and cold on the other…my hair was impeccable when I left!"

Stayed one night","Overall positive stay, but with a couple hiccups. It was a beautiful spacious place with a nice mix of historic and modern. Everything was clean and comfortable. We loved the location except for the very loud music and base from 10-2 on Saturday night. We paid for early check in and there is a miscommunication about when it'd be ready, and then when we tried to get in there was an issue. We ended up paying $35 for only an extra half hour. The app would not allow us to check in early and the key pad had dead batteries. They came right away to replace the batteries and helped us with the app. I'm sure that doesn't usually happen. It was a great place to stay, just be aware of the loud bar below."

As soon as you walk in it's very beautiful and there is a lot of space I love the kitchen and bathroom and the window view.

I walked around the corner to The Foundry for a tasty drink. I stayed on a Saturday night, there's a bar nearby. I heard the music & people in the area but that didn't disturb me. I was up around 2 am inside & I saw police lights down below outside. Someone was getting arrested. I felt safe upstairs & behind a locked door on the street.
Just FYI, there is a tall flight of stairs from the street level to this unit. I had to walk it multiple times. Could be an issue for someone with mobility issues.
Bed is firm but I slept good.. It really is a beautiful space. Thank you."

Clearly personal touches; only Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in with a Chemex and fresh, local coffee. Walking distance to tons of great food. Be sure to check out Culture ETX and its speakeasy. Cool find! Only complaint, and really probably more of a personal preference, was the bed was more on the “firm” end of the spectrum for my spouse and I’s liking. Overall tho, top notch, would come back in a heartbeat🙏🏼"

It is very irritating to have a checkout of 10:00 am -- even threatening in the house guest book you'll charge extra if the guest stays at all past 10:00 am -- and then on top of leaving so early, have the guest do several chores. It adds stress to the morning when you're there to enjoy yourself and instead you have to wake up earlier to make sure all chores are done and get out in time. Just something to consider."

Stayed one night","I traveled from Dallas to Tyler to play with a band at a venue one block from the loft. My wife came along with me so we could meet up with family from the area and stay the night.
The loft was wonderful and was just like the photos and the owners were very quick to respond with my questions.
I would recommend this loft and we’ll hopefully stay again."

Stayed one night","Absolutely lovely! A gorgeous exposed brick, amenity driven, centrally located space. It was like I wasn’t even in Texas anymore! I loved being able to walk everywhere, extremely safe. The bar next door was a bit loud but that was just a few songs that I think caused like sounds to carry over but it died down so fast. Can’t wait to come back, I don’t have enough space to write all the good things to say!"

Stayed a few nights","This beautiful loft is a very comfortable place to stay in downtown Tyler. The decor is so pleasant and comfortable. The ambiance urges you to relax and forget about the world outside. The location is convenient and the free parking was nice. We didn’t mind the stairs; it was easy to get our suitcases to the loft. We enjoyed the complimentary coffee, roasted recently, along with leftovers from a nearby restaurant, for breakfast one morning. The towels and bathrobes were thick and luxurious. It was always interesting to look out the floor-to-ceiling windows and see what was going on in the downtown square."

Stayed a few nights","Brick Street King suite is a great hidden gem.
Imagine you're hanging out in a small town square, enjoying good food, libations, and overall good vibes. Then when it's time to rest you simply unlock a nondescript door in a historic brick building, escape up the stairs to a luxurious modern suite with a grand view of the square you were just on.
well imagine it no more. Experience it with this unique Air BnB!
The suite was clean, with a full kitchen, although chefs may want to bring their own knives.
upon entry the reveal is quite astonishing!
looking for a fun stay in the midst of Tyler? or just looking for a break from hotels when traveling for work (as I was) you won't be disappointed.
Sam and Ambers communication was excellent. they will make sure you have everything you need!"

The kitchen had everything we needed and more: kettle, two types of coffee makers, toaster, and even had teas and coffee left out for us. Loved the apple tv; what a great touch.
The house has a beautiful view of picturesque downtown Tyler.
Not too much noise around, sleeping was never disturbed. The bed is firm, not hard. There are two sets of pillows with varying firmness. The sheets are soft, as are the towels and robes. A double shower in the spacious bathroom was spectacular.
Parking.
Know that the street near the house is one-way, so check your navigator to maneuver around to the back of the building.
The apartment overlooks a trendy part of the area with shops and eateries worth your time. There are also museums within walking distance.
Truly a treat, this apartment is perfect for a getaway."

The place was clean, inviting and absolutely gorgeous. It has a great lay out. Lots of room for everyone. Lots of coffee pods, towels, and trash bags to lee things tidy. The hosts where responsive right from the start we had Great communication. I had a last minute addition of guests and a small pet so I sent them a message and I wasn’t sure how to go about adding them. They responded and said there was not problem in doing the addition. The house it’s self is absolutely gorgeous! Beds where great, pillows where great and the couch was big and comfy! I loved that there was no clutter. It’s was fresh, bright and crisp is the only way I can describe to to make sense. We felt so at home, by far the best place we have ever stayed. Quiet neighborhood. Enough beds for my entire family. The hosts where so helpful & made sure we were good! 20 out of 10!!"

Group trip","The house was new and comfortable. Enough space for our party of 4 adults and 3 children. Plenty of towels, plates, glasses, pots/pans, utensils. Unfortunately, since the house was so new, the neighborhood was still under construction. Every morning we woke to the sounds of hammers, saws, and nail guns between 6-7am. There were no curtains on the windows and the sun came in pretty early. We couldn't sleep in during our stay. There were also several crickets we killed and ants, probably also due to the new construction in the area. The rooms, kitchen, bathrooms were clean, but all the floors needed mopping. We also found hair in the sheets and bath towels. I found the bed to be comfortable, but the other the adults in our party thought the beds were too firm. Close to restaurants, grocery store, gas station."

It is a new development so if you want to do any walking/jogging you will need to drive down the road just a bit to a local park. The house is new so everything works perfectly and is in great condition. The beds are memory foam but are extremely firm, which was the only down side of the the house. We loved the sofa so much we asked where they got it and are buying one for our own house. :) If we are ever in Tyler again, will try to stay with this host again."

Less than five miles away from everything we needed. Mr. Gustavo's response time is very fast. My guest and I truly enjoyed our stay. This house is very recommended!

Just a note: Once booked, the picture of the house/neighborhood that Google Maps has for the location is incorrect. The photo we saw was outdated and misleading because it is a very nice, quiet and newly developed neighborhood. All new construction."

Stayed with a pet","Wonderful place and more than what we needed for 1 night stay. I wish we could have stayed longer. Lydia's place was peaceful, quiet and private, a nice break in our travels throughout Texas. Bed was comfy but if an additional one was needed, there's another one in the loft. Kitchen amenities was top notch and well organized. And did I mention there are goats, dogs, and chickens nearby? And the whole place was surrounded by trees? A perfect place for anyone to recharge. If antique shopping/browsing is your thing, nearby are antiques stores in Tyler and Gladewater, the latter being the antique mecca of East Texas!"

I'm a small town girl and was solo traveling. It was perfect. It was modem with rustic touches. My only wish is a tiny, cheapy table to set my food or drink on while parked on the couch. Lydia is super quick to respond. I loved the bed, but if you like a firm bed, which I don't, this may not be the bed you. I will be back the next time I have class 3 days in a row."

We needed a place to stay for the night on our cross-country move, and we are so glad we found this Airbnb as it was exactly what we needed to rest, regroup, and continue on our trip. It was especially nice to have so much space (inside and outside) to stretch our legs after being in the car for so long. There was a comfortable couch, large TV, dining table, full kitchen, full bathroom with washer/dryer, a bedroom and a loft - truly everything we needed and more. Finally, the dogs were adorable and so were the sheep! FIVE STARS - highly recommend!!!"

The dogs that roam the land are lovely and super friendly. We enjoyed seeing the farm life too.

There was so much space for my pup and I. We had been on a long road trip, so it was nice to be able to move around! The kitchen was well stocked and the whole place stayed nice and cool.
Heads up, the short gravel driveway to get to the rental area was very bumpy and rough, and there's a decent hill to go down/up. Not 4x4 needed rough, but it was definitely worth mentioning. 10/10. Will stay again if I'm in the area!"

The place was exactly as described—totally clean and completely accessible. The hosts were wonderful, going above and beyond to make sure my stay was comfortable and enjoyable. Their attention to detail did not go unnoticed.
I would highly recommend this property to anyone looking to escape the hustle and bustle while still wanting modern comforts. It truly offers the best of both worlds.

Weston and Lydia are delightful hosts who are very responsive and friendly. They went out of their ways to make us feel welcomed and made sure that we had everything we needed.
