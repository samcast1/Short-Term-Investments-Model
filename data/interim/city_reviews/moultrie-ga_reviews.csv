Stayed about a week","We stayed for almost two weeks as were were in town for work. Great place to come back to at night and onthe weekend to relax. The back porch is awesome and the swing is fantastic. Very peaceful and relaxing to have a cold beverage and realx after a long days work. Godd hot water pressure as three of us were managing the bathroom inthe morning and it was never an issue.
I know my bed was very comfortable and I di dnot hear anyone else complaining. We will be back!!"

We will be staying again the next time in town.
Thank You!"

Stayed a few nights","Laura went above and beyond.
My car battery gave out, so I had to get a new battery. The first time the car would not start was at the Air BNB. I messaged Laura to ask it there happened to be jumper cables on the property I could use. She said there was not, but she said that she would bring her jump box over.
So she dropped whatever she was doing, on Easter weekend, to come and jump off my car.
She saved the day with my family, and made it possible for me to get to an auto supply store to get a new battery.
You can't ask much more than that from an Air BNB host.
Thanks again, and the place was great. The lake is beautiful, and that there is a boat ramp and dock right in the back yard makes it all the better!"

Group trip","We were visiting our aunt for her 80th birthday and decided to stay at an AirBnB instead of a hotel room. Laura was very accomodating. The home is older but it has been updated so the interior is modern. There is plenty of room and the four kids were able to have their own beds. The house is located on Indian Lake. We didn't have fishing poles but Laura allowed the boys to use their poles. The 11 and 14-year-old boys loved fishing off the deck and they were out fishing by 7 am. The 3 and 8-year-old girls loved playing in the private boat ramp and catching minnows. The swing on the back patio area was big enough for us all to get a family picture. The girls locked a couple of inside doors accidentally and the owner had someone unlock them right away. The boys didn't want to come on the trip because they thought they would be bored. However, after 18 fish were caught and released they can't wait to return. Awesome trip. We would love to rent this house again in the future."

Stayed a few nights","We needed a place to stay with reasonable access to Tallahassee and FSU. The drive to Tallahassee is a bit over an hour but the roads are state and US highways and very well kept.
We prefer quiet and dark and this location was perfect in that regard although we carry the means to darken windows should we encounter outdoor security lights that we don't control. The Barn is surrounded by fields in cultivation and is set in a rural area with easy access to restaurants and shopping in Moultrie, GA.
We messaged with Nick a couple of times and got helpful replies speedily. He provides phone numbers for him and for a local contact which we did not have the occasion to use. The Barn was spotlessly clean, neat and seemingly brand new as regards construction and furnishings.
The Roku TV's were unfamiliar to us so here's a hint - there is a phone app that one connects to the TV which gives better control than the provided remote control."

Stayed a few nights","If you are ever looking for a place to stay in Moultrie, I highly recommend staying here! I reached out to Nick, the host, after the recent hurricane came through south GA, looking for a place for my family to stay while power was being restored. He could not have been more kind, helpful and flexible to help accommodate in the situation. The place itself was very clean and well maintained with plenty of space. My family was very impressed with how well stocked the kitchen was, allowing them to put together meals with ease. Additionally, the property was very peaceful and private. Would stay again without hesitation!"

Stayed one night","Well maintained, peaceful property. Easy to check in. I was very impressed upon entering the place. I'm a clean freak, so I felt immediately relaxed when I saw that I had nothing to clean up (as in some unfortunate places). It was well equiped. Full size refrigerator, stove/oven, microwave, dishwasher, washer and dryer. Loved having the place to myself, my own bathroom. Plenty of room for luggage, huge closets, extra blankets. Airconditioning worked great. The ceiling fan in the bedroom was SILENT, which was awesome! Everything was as advertised! A bench on which to set things when entering which was great for unpacking and packing vehicle. My favorite thing was having my own garage space right next to the entrance. This meant that all the things in my car didn't have to sit out in the sun, as I travel continually and don't always want to unpack everything. And it is great for when arriving in the rain. Would stay again! Host is pleasant and responsive. Highly recommend. Thanks Nick!"

Group trip","The Barn was the perfect place to stay for a few days! My family rented it for a college graduation. Very friendly hosts, quietly surrounded by farm fields and a super comfortable home. The kitchen was the most completely stocked airbnb kitchen I have ever seen, a huge plus.
One thing I appreciate from airbnb reviews is a description of the location. At first I thought I was turning into the wrong driveway but I saw the sign as pictured. The airbnb is behind the family home, just keep going. It is located in the equivalent of the backyard but has perfect privacy. The Hodges are lovely people and great hosts. Go ahead and book, you won’t regret it!"

Stayed a few nights","Nick's place was a nice place to stay and I would not hesitate to return. Everything was clean and nice. Beds clean and comfortable and kitchen very nice. Living room was a little small but more than adequate. Only issues we had were the house rules. They were reasonable except for the one where you could be asked to leave if you had alcohol or firearms on the premises. The alcohol was not a problem for us but may be for some people but we often travel with a fireman when we go long distances. If this is indeed a firm rule then it should be clearly stated before you get there. After you're there what do you do? Also I kind of thought sweeping the floors and wiping the counters would be covered by the cleaning fee but we did it anyway.
But again it was a nice safe, clean, and quiet stay and is a nice place."

More than enough pillows are available on each bed. If you love soft touches you'll love the bedroom ceiling. Where the ceiling fan is some beautiful wood work has been added. The kitchen is spacious and is well supplied with everything you'll need for cooking. The kitchen is all wood and looks amazing. Home has it's own parking area. Host are quick to respond to any issues or questions. Can't say if any neighbors are also on the property due to never seeing or hearing anyone. Will definitely be returning to visit and staying in this beautiful home again.

The view into the field is nice for the sunrise and sunset if you enjoy that sort of thing. Worth the money spent for a peaceful couple of days not doing much of anything. The outdoor kitchen features a television that can be watched while you cook on the grill. The fire pit allowed for a nice fire to roast marshmallows. We enjoyed walking to the woodline and getting our wood for the fire. We're interested in purchasing a camper so we wanted to get the feel for what it'd be like to really stay in one and we got exactly what we needed from this trip.

Ants made way to bathroom sink, I let owner know so she could set traps after we left. Stay was close to what we needed, private, and cozy!"

Our girls enjoyed the loft bed above the door before you head through the garage part of the rv. You won’t need anything but food if you decide to cook. It was nice and cozy and amazing. Thanks for a great stay and have a merry Christmas!

Stayed with kids","Very pleasant stay. What I liked the most was we got there very late and check-in was no problem. The trailer was a little hard to find because I wasn’t following the instructions. The camper was so modern and home like. It was new and had many modern features we enjoyed. We were cold when we got there, so we turned on the fireplace by big screen TV and also we turned on the heat for the entire camper, which in the morning we were toasty warm. The sofas in the camper had recliners, heated seats and even massage! The hosts were very responsive whenever we had any questions or concerns. Having coffee outside on the chairs provided was so quiet and peaceful. The camper was clean and had plenty of space for all of us. The entire 5th wheel was very clean and the bathroom was spotless. The beds were comfortable. I took the master bedroom. It had three flatscreen TV’s for everyone to enjoy. It was a great experience and our grandkids loved it! I’m looking to buy a camper. Would stay again!"

The host goes above and beyond to make sure your trip goes smooth and that you have everything you need. Would highly recommend this place to anybody looking for somewhere to stay in Moultrie!

The shed was nicely furnished and kept up to date and clean and felt inviting and cozy. The tin roof accentuated the rain sound and gave it a true cabin feel. Hosts were responsive and friendly. The city of Thomasville is cute and has a lot to offer. We enjoyed our stay at the shed!

Stayed one night","Sometimes the expectations of city life cause one to pause when looking into ""countryside"" airbnb's. Don't be deceived! The Shack is everything an airbnb is supposed to be. Clean and modern...and a piano!?! Urban with that wonderful country indifference too polished showmanship. The Shack celebrates rest and light. It invites you in with spaciousness and thoughtful decorating touches. I was instantly home and when it came time to leave I realized I had not planned enough time to stay.
Don't rush if you stay at the Shack. Plan for 3 nights if you can. Enjoy the restfulness and the clean, white spaces filled with light. You wont be sorry."

Great location to stores and coffee shops, secluded away from noise, and while it is on the property next to the owners house-- there are trees that frame the place (that has lots of big windows) so it feels like you are in the woods! It is a converted shed that has been done up with premium furnishings and wonderful touches of class and style. Large and spacious, immaculately clean, and a full kitchen. Amazing."

Everything was extremely clean and you can tell there was extra thought put into our airbnb experience. From the drinks provided in the fridge to the extra toothbrushes and razor. We felt very at home here and the barn was very unique. I’ve never stayed in such a beautifully decorated place. It was also incredibly clean. The cleaning lady even left us a sweet note upon arrival. If we are ever back in Thomasville, we will make sure to stay here again!
Thanks so much Shaunna!"

I think the kitchen and bathroom had literally everything we needed and we could have left our own supplies at home and been fine. The place felt very spacious and homey and one of the more unique places we have stayed. Thomasville is adorable and has a wonderful little downtown with some excellent and unique shopping and dining. Whether passing through and need a place to put up for the night like us or staying a few days, this is a great place to call home while you're away from yours. : )"

Stayed a few nights","Shaunna's place is better than we expected, even after reading all the reviews. Yes the place is super clean and super adorable and comfortable, but here is what really stood out. We have stayed at many AIRB&B and VRBOs for many years. We have noticed that little by little more hosts have gotten chintzy with what they provide i.e. amount of toilet paper, paper towels, bath towels, shampoo, soaps etc. I get it, supplies can get expensive if you have to replace them so often. So we have come not to expect much. We usually always stop by a drugstore and make sure we get water bottles and back up supplies. Well we were shocked to see that Shaunna had already provided those little things that have disappeared. Drinks in the fridge, cute new toothbrushes (that matched the decor :) and mini toothpaste. All the streaming services were logged in and available, we usually have to log into our personal accounts and remember to log out before we leave). Thomasville was fine, but our stay in this cute AirBNB is what we will remember. Thank you Shaunna."

The furnishings are very comfortable and clean and attractive. The kitchen is VERY large and has so much counter space that we could spread out everything we brought with us and still had lots of room for meal prep. Kitchen is stocked with everything you need or might want for full time living!
The bath and a half are clean and look new and up to date.
The bedroom is roomy and the bed was perfect for my wife and I. Plenty of pillows and blankets, etc to make yourself warm and comfortable.
There is a porch with seating on 3 sides of the cottage so that you can find shade or a cool breeze whichever way it is blowing. There is also a grill and a firepit in the back yard.
Lawanda is a great host. She made us feel welcome and like family. So very kind!
Highly recommended!"

But her place was in a great, quiet neighborhood and had plenty of space for all of us. I don’t think we could have found a better place for our needs without tripling our costs. And to make it sweeter, there were delicious goodies waiting for our arrival. Pun intended! Thanks Lawanda!"

Stayed with kids",We booked this cottage for 2 separate weekends. The host canceled my 2nd reservation without notice or explanation. I emailed her to get an explanation but she never replied. I called to check out the next day and that's when she told me she readmy email and that it's nothing personal she don't allow locals or anyone affiliated with locals to stay at the property. This is not stated on the listing. This was very inconvenient b/c we are a military family and we're looking for a place to stay in Moultrie until my husband comes back from deployment. I feel this was very unprofessional on her part. As a Military we can't just travel when we want. These days has to be requested. Definitely would not recommend staying here.

Thank you so much for your hospitality and wonderful cottage. we will DEFINITELY be back soon."

I'll get back to that, but let me say that Lawanda's communication was second to none and she was on top of my check in to make sure it was seamless. The interior is super comfortable due to the multitude of ceiling fans and A/C that was running when I arrived. The linens were comfy and smelled awesome....yup, true story they smelled great and I never noticed that sort of thing before. The unit was clean and well laid out with a few porches and parking right out in front of the door. It was the little touches the made me feel pampered like a welcome note, a tray of sweets, and nice soaps/shampoo. I'm sure I'm missing something, but I will say that if work brings me into this area again I will see if this rental is available!!! Thank you!!"

Stayed a few nights","Classic Beauty is the perfect place to stay in Moultrie, Georgia – Judy is a most accommodating hostess of delightfully spacious, clean, and quiet accommodations. The kitchen is large and perfectly equipped with everything you might require. There are plenty of pots, pans, mixing bowls, glasses, dishes, and silverware – even a well-stocked spice rack. Clearly, the kitchen was set up by a generous and cooking-savvy hostess.
There is a dining table that easily seats 6 to 8 alongside an attractive living room. There is an equally spacious family room with TV offering another place to gather. This room opens on to an enormous patio with a wood burning fireplace and a gas grill. Comfortable seating inside and out is ample. There is a two-car carport attached to the house, so getting in and out while staying dry was not a problem. Judy was welcoming and quick to respond if we had a question. We will think of Classic Beauty first on any return trip to Moultrie. It was perfect!!"

Stayed with kids","Although we were not at the house that much other than sleeping as we were at my family reunion, the house was very comfortable and even bigger than I had imagined from the photos. The house was immaculately clean and well provided with amenities! The only thing I will say which is not intended as a negative review but the second bathroom needs some updating with plumbing and sink and tub! But it was totally functional! The rest of the house is beautifully updated, furnished and decorated. Although I didn't have to contact Judy (because everything was taken care of so well) she reached out to me to offer her assistance should we need it!! Annette Saul"

The laundry room complete with washer, dryer, sink and iron/ironing board was great. Plenty of towels and accessories were available in both full bathrooms.

Having the pull through garage was a game changer as it was raining when we arrived and it allowed us to unload in the dry. I can't say enough great things about this house and Emily's aid in making our trip awesome. We were down Quail hunting in the area for 2 days and this was the perfect spot for us to spend the night. I hope we will be back.

Group trip","The home was situated beautifully between cotton and cattle fields and was clean and well maintained. With 4 porches, you have your choice of where to relax and gather. It was for a girls weekend that our other airbnb got cancelled just a few weeks prior to our visit to Thomasville. We were very grateful to find this was available! Property is extra charming, even more so than the pictures convey. It was beautifully updated without losing the charm of a century+ year old farm house. Master bed was oversized and comfortable. Friends commented that the twin beds were super comfortable. The oven door was damaged by the previous guest and Emily made sure a countertop oven was provided the day of arrival so we weren't inconvenienced. There were snacks on the able to welcome us. The home is located about 20 minutes from Thomasville. If you're seeking peaceful, spacious and charming, don't hesitate. Emily was very responsive and we felt right at home."

We were so glad the rain held off so we could meander around the property during our morning coffee and enjoy a true moment of serenity. It’s a special place and Emily was beyond accommodating!"

I will start by the front of the house: only one word to describe it ""amazing."" As we drove up we saw the front yard and how beautiful the property was. The carport was in the back of the house and easily accessible to the back door of the house. Every morning my family and ate breakfast at the side of the house looking at the cows near the property. The house was exceptionally clean and comfortable. The California king size bed was heavenly. My son enjoyed running with our new puppy in the yard. The details in the house were elegant. From the French faucet to the bathroom décor. Our family had an unbelievable New Year and will absolutely book another and longer stay."

The rooms are big, beds are super comfortable, and there is tons of storage. The outdoor fireplace was so nice to gather around on the chilly mornings and evenings. We brought bocce and cornhole, and the dogs had a blast running around the property while my family spent quality time together outdoors.
Emily is very kind and quick to respond. She had a basket of snacks waiting when we arrived, which was so appreciated after our drives in from across the state. We met at the farmhouse for a pre-Christmas gathering and Emily even had a pretty tree decorated in the living room!
Moultrie is just a 7-8 minute drive away, where there’s a Walmart and Publix for anything you forgot. The antique stores there are cute, too!
If you’re looking for respite from the hustle and bustle…this is the place! We will most definitely be back!"

Stayed with kids","We absolutely adore this farmhouse.
Although I selfishly would like for nobody else to know of the hidden treasure, there, so that it will be available any time we want to revisit, I want all of you to know just how precious it is. I hope couples and families find peace and rest and absolute pleasure when they visit as we certainly did.
I appreciate how someone updated only what was necessary while preserving what could be of the 106-yr old structure. The feeling and existence of old still exists with the perks of modern plumbing, appliances, etc. If you love farms and old farmhouses, this is your dream spot. While you cook in the kitchen, you look out to see an old white barn and the cattle who move and graze. During the fall, the cotton is healthy and in full bloom. The dawn just before sunrise is painted in beautiful colors - such a wonderful sky on which to affix your eyes while drinking coffee and praying in the mornings.
There is a screened porch off the kitchen / dining room and just 2 steps down is an covered porch with a fireplace. The evenings and mornings were cool in October when we visited. We built a fire for our kids and had s'mores in the evening and ate breakfast in the morning in front of the fire.
The pictures simply cannot capture the beauty of this place!
We hope to stay many times more in the future and make memories that will bring joy to recall!"

We had 4 adults and two small children, there was loads of room and the house was extremely clean and tidy. The entire property is well maintained. The area is very peaceful and it made for a great getaway from the Atlanta metro area. I've never seen a rental so well stocked with anything and everything you could need during your stay. We would not hesitate to stay again if we are back in that area."

She introduced herself, and gave us locations to some great places. She was very responsive in anything we needed. Everything was fabulous, and it felt like home. Loved the fruit tree!! Only thing that wasn't the greatest was the wifi. It wasn't a super huge deal, but it made it hard to work and get calls. Even still, we'd stay again!"

The house is spacious and has some unique characteristics from the kitchen cabinets made from an original barn to all of supplies and amenities. A baker certainly stays here sometimes as you can tell from all the kitchen tools. Being able to use all the cast iron pots to prepare meals was a treat. Wonderful property, spacious both inside and out. About a 20 minute drive into town. Communication was almost immediate and the owner even came to make sure we were all set. We hope to be able to return next time we are in Moultrie."

The house is super equipped with everything (reading books, recipes, board games to sewing thread. What you least think you can get in the laundry area.
The kitchen has everything, even utensils to prepare a cake, nothing is missing. If you forgot a seasoning to cook, don't worry, you get it there too.
The house in general is super clean and well cared for. The super comfortable rooms (extra pillows, sheets and blankets). The bathrooms that are especially important to me were also super clean with enough towels and hot water was never short.
Just 15-20 minutes away you can find a Walmart and a good Mexican Restaurant.
If you need anything Julie is always attentive to help you.
Thank you, Julie and Mr. Henson, for allowing us to stay at their family home.

Our only inconvenience was that the WiFi was a little slow. It was plenty fast enough for checking email or working with text only, but my husband was planning to work during our stay, and he was a bit frustrated at points because it was hard to get his stuff done. The cellular connection wasn’t any stronger, so he couldn’t set up a hotspot. Other than this very small issue, the place was PERFECT. I highly recommend it with that one small caveat."

Stayed a few nights",House has everything you could possibly need and more! Lovely porch swing was great to enjoy the quiet of the countryside. It was perfect for our whole family. Would absolutely stay again the next time we are in Moultrie.

Stayed a few nights",The house was extremely clean but definitely had a musty smell in areas. My family and I enjoyed our stay but be careful sitting on the swings. My pregnant sister in law (who weighs about 100 lbs) sat n one of the swings and the metal hook holding the swing snapped in half. Luckily she was perfectly fine and when I let Julie know she showed care and concern for her well being. The master bed frame feels very flimsy and like it's going to fall apart at any moment. Beautiful house and grounds with a relaxing feel.

Stayed a few nights","This house is beautiful with wood flooring throughout the entirety. Very secluded out in the country on 5 acres. Took me back to growing up on a farm. Easy check in with Julies' father Frank, who made us feel right at home. Great communication with Julie. Everything you could want and need in a home. The only possible negative for some would be cell service. We have AT&T and most of the time had no cell service, but we were able to use our phones with wifi calling."

Stayed about a week","Julie and her father Frank were great Hosts. The house was perfect for our needs - Close to Moultrie and still rural enough that we could enjoy the peace and quiet of country living. Frank was in constant contact with us making sure we had everything we needed and answered all of our questions about Moultrie - the history and farming -and all of GA. The house was very well kept and comfortable for us and our employees that stayed with us and had everything we need for a weeks stay and plan to return again next year. Thank you to Julie, Frank and Laverne for all thier kindness and the use of thier home!"

Stayed over a week",This was a great find! The house and the property were absolutely charming and peaceful. Frank and Julie were wonderful to work with! Only one minor issue... there is no cell service within 2 miles of the house so we had to rely on the home wifi to make calls.

Stayed a few nights","Our entire experience was wonderful. We were in town to give our mom an 80th birthday party. Staying at the airbnb was a home away from home. Our host was gracious and made us feel welcome.
This was our first of many stays.
Thanks"

Stayed a few nights","Host met us with keys and had the air conditioner going full blast. Very nice relief from South Georgia heat and humidity. Well kept house on a beautiful lot. Basic supplies provided. Plenty of towels in the nicely updated bathrooms. We loved it and hope to stay here again on future visits. Julie is very easy to work with, too."

Stayed a few nights","This stay was excellent. Julie was super responsive to all my questions, and let me book WAY ahead of time. The house was just enough off the beaten path to feel completely isolated, but not so far out that it's inconvenient. The house itself is deceptively large...Looks small from the outside, but it is really laid out well to where you feel like the inside is twice as big as expected. The kitchen was well stocked (as far as stuff to use like pots, pans, etc...) the cabinets are awesome, made from reclaimed wood from an old wood mill that used to be across the street. I can't say enough good things about it. Really made an already fantastic weekend, even better"

Stayed a few nights","This property was perfect for the occasion of our family vacation. It was far better than the description and pictures posted online. The home is beautiful in its construction and decor. The bedrooms and bathrooms looked like a 4 star inn and were very comfortable. The kitchen was equipped with everything a chef would need. The host was extremely accommodating, helpful and friendly. I especially enjoyed the swings under the arbor and the ones on the front porch. We also enjoyed daily nature walks along the beautiful trails. We truly enjoyed this home and the charm of the surrounding areas. I highly recommend this property."

We asked if they had a toaster and they did not, but he brought one for us to use. Amazing place and we hope it is available next year for us to stay!!! We LOVED the house! 5 STAR!!!"

Stayed a few nights","This was a really comfortable and wonderful country home. Inside there were two comfortable sitting areas to read or visit, a well-stocked and easy to use kitchen, and comfortable bedrooms, beds and linens. Outside was an expansive yard and dirt road back to a pond that make for good walking and exploring. For biologists, there was an active gopher tortoise burrow, fox squirrels, and red-headed woodpeckers! The house is perfect for rest and relaxation. The only primary item missing was no wifi."
