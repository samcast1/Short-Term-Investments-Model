We were thrilled to have a 2 bedroom apartment to stay in. Especially nice to have a separate bedroom for each couple. Having a full kitchen was also nice. With the food they provided (enough for the entire time) and what we brought- we were all set for the entire stay.
Plenty of blankets, towels, etc were available.
I highly recommend Dawn’s place. If we come back this way-‘we will be staying here."

Stayed a few nights","Thank you Doyle Family!
What a fabulous place to relax and if you’re interested, learn a about regenerative farming.
We were treated like old friends and felt we definitely made new friends.
Steve was super informative about the farm.
DeAnne was a love and made us the best breakfast ( two days in a row) we’ve ever had at a bnb.
Morgan gave us a little tour one afternoon and explained the cows,chickens and sheep to us.
Beautiful pups, Beaula and Sadie and I forgot the sweet cats name.
Just a beautiful setting and then on our way out we stopped at their brick and mortar farmers market in town and we’re delighted with the selection there. I think over 80 merchants were selling their food and homemade products .
Can’t say enough good things about this lovely family and their farm!
Just visit, you’ll be happy you did.
Thanks again Doyle’s"

Stayed with kids","Even though we were only there for one night (would have been amazing to stay longer!) on our way to WY, Steve and DeeAnn (and Johnny) were amazing hosts. It was such a perfect place for us to stay, the cabin was amazing for 4 or us(2 adults and 2 kids).When we arrived We were greeted with such kindness and hospitality, and DeeAnn and Johnny showed us around the farm and were such great hosts.Enjoying the animals and the environment was an amazing experience for the boys, and We were even given some recommendations for where to have dinner in town (Rusty Truck-so good). The breakfast they made from the eggs and vegetables from the farm was awesome and a great way to end the morning after a wonderful farm tour with Steve, Johnny and DeeAnn.The boys were especially excited that they had a companion to show them around and to play with on the farm as traveling with two adults for two weeks can prove to not be so exciting for them.
I would recommend the Doyle Farm Family to anyone!"

Stayed one night","My partner and I spent one lovely evening on this beautiful property with the wonderful Doyle family. As we look back on our 10-day trip, this was certainly the most memorable of our journey. Wish that our time in Riverton were a little longer. Our evening relaxing on the front porch of this rustic and charming back cabin was a serene and delightful highlight. The space is comfortable and provided everything we needed for a good night of rest. I was excited to use the outdoor shower, but we arrived in the evening and left early in the morning and didn't get the chance. Brushing our teeth at the the outdoor ""sink"" in the morning while the chickens roamed around at our feet was so much fun. Getting to feed the herd of cows was an exciting experience for me and I thank Morgan for her time with us. Dee Ann is a beautifully kind woman and a totally wonderful hostess who provided us a most delicious homemade breakfast with organic food either grown on the farm or traded with neighbors. Steve's stories were entertaining and our conversations with him and the entire family were easy, friendly, and familiar. We felt totally comfortable and welcome on their farm and appreciate the kindness they extended during our short time with them. This place is a real gem in the middle of Wyoming and the perfect example of what we hope for when we choose an Airbnb. Thanks for everything!"

Stayed a few nights","I'm concerned about giving a rave review because I plan to come back. This place books up completely for good reason. The Doyles have created a truly and wonderfully unique experience. Guests get to stay in an old house once used by a farm worker. Being in it is like thrilling time travel especially for a kid, I bet. I'm old but the place awakened child-like delight in me. The dogs, cats and even turkeys (which may imprint on you) are incredibly friendly. The breakfast is better than most restaurants I've been in. Cross my heart. The hosts are top notch. Caring, considerate people who are changing their part of the world for the better. Potential guests who require a flush toilet and indoor shower should move on but they'll be missing a profoundly memorable experience.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart, Steve, DeeAnn, Morgan, Beau, Blue, Beulah, Sadie and the turkeys whose names I didn't catch. See you next summer if you aren't fully booked by March."

Stayed with kids","DeeAnn and Steve (and family) were wonderful hosts. The farmhouse is quaint and reminiscent of simpler times. We squeezed our family of 5 (2 adults and 3 young kids) into the house but we’re a camping family so it was plenty of room for us. The only unpleasant part of the stay was the mosquitos but that’s the reality of a working farm, and they had bug spray to share. The breakfast DeeAnn made both mornings we were there were delicious! The animals were cute (especially the young turkeys) and added charm to our stay. Don’t hesitate to stay here. Thank you Doyle Family!!"

Stayed a few nights","One of the nicest hosts out there. Loved the stay and the chance to learn about the farm and the sustainable practices they've adopted. The description is accurate- this is a working farm and we were greeted by turkey chicks and playful cow dogs, and the day we left they were processing chickens. The house is simple (no tv, or AC and limited outlets) but incredibly practical and comfortable even in the middle of summer. The farm-cooked breakfasts were delicious. If I ever find myself in Riverton in the future I'd definitely seek Steve out again."

DeeAnn’s fresh breakfast is worth the value alone! Our 6-year-old had a blast playing around the farm and we so loved that Steve and DeeAnn spent time teaching us about their farm and the animals. Highly recommended if you’re going through town!

The cottage is comfortable and I enjoyed eating breakfast and drinking coffee on the back porch watching the chickens. Your farm and family are beautiful! I felt at peace here. The sustainable oasis you have built is nothing short of incredible. I enjoyed the tour of the baby farm animals, learning about your farm, helping to get a newborn calf safely back to his mom, and herding cows with you. Steve, DeeAnne, and Morgan are the hardest working, caring, kindest folks I have met in a long time. I don't usually travel to the same place twice but I would definitely consider coming, here again, to get away from it all!"

We stay at places where we can cook our own meals due to health conditions. This place lacks as microwave, a toaster, and baking dishes. The dishes in the cupboards had to be washed before we used them as there was dust on all of them. Same with the floor. It looks like they are still trying to finish remodeling this place. We loved the peaceful quiet location, but it was not indicated how far out of town is was located. The washer had sheets in it that we dried and folded, but the shelf above the washer was dirty and cluttered. There is no laundry soap, but we took our own. Overall we would stay there again, but next time go prepared with all our own items."

We enjoyed our s’mores kit after dinner (highly recommend La Luna nearby), loved watching the stars after sunset, and were even able to do a couple sparklers. The electric fireplace inside the granary provided plenty of warmth. The VHS player was super fun (a little skippy, not sure if it was the tape we chose though) and there was plenty of selection.

Stayed with a pet","This was one of the best Airbnb experiences I've ever had, due in large part to the location but also thanks to Paulette's friendly, proactive instructions and availability, even when I booked only 20 hours prior to arrival. It was extremely peaceful and quiet, and thanks to its rather isolated location, the night sky with an early waxing crescent moon was an incredible sight to behold. Being able to have my dog there and walk her around the ranch to greet all the other dogs and horses was the cherry on top. Also, and this was just a nostalgic piece for me, I surprisingly enjoyed using a VCR again. Be kind and rewind!
If you need easy/quick bathroom access, look at their campers or Bunkhouse. I would also recommend applying lots of bug spray.
All in all, I could not recommend this stay more. 20/10. I wish I could have stayed longer. If I am ever in Riverton again and this stay is available, I will be staying here."

If you are looking for a quiet, clean, relaxing spot this is perfect, or if you are looking for something to tell friends and family about as a standout of your trip this is perfect. Great for a couple or family, kids would think this is the greatest thing ever! Paulette has lots of Disney movies to watch, comedies, and an assortment of other movies. My wife made friends with the horse in the coral close to us 😊. The Granary is exactly as described by Paulette, no surprises, except for maybe realizing how rare and special this Granary is.
This is simply an exceptional and wonderfully unique AirBnB!!"

It is dusty and smells like horse droppings. The bathroom is a good 50 yards away and it has a small dated toilet. The bunk beds are wobbly and an adult does not feel safe on the top level. I really wanted to like it but couldn’t. I cancelled my stay and got a partial refund."

My daughterand I were hungry & EXHAUSTED when we got to the area. Paulette had excellent food recommendations and a comfortable, welcoming place for us to sleep.
After some food and a nap, we got to know the locals (Otis the donkey, Whiskey the mare & Griz the dog). Even my dogs (one of which is a rescue and is scared of most other dogs) loved Griz! We enjoyed a wonderful night under the stars next to a fire. I can't imagine anything closer to heaven!
And Paulette was friendly and just the sweetest!
The grain silo was a fun addition to our summer road trip! And the facilities were so clean! And where on earth did that mattress come from?! I have got to get me one of those!
And my dogs LOVED all the space they had to roam on! (Acres and acres of pasture land.) Getting out to the middle of nowhere, where they could run off leash to their little puppy hearts' content, sniff all the sniffs and explore was a highlight of their trip!
Next time I need to escape daily life... I know where I'm heading... Back to where Otis brays from his paddock when he sees me! (He really knows how to make a girl feel special!)"

I’d call it glamping for sure, so not fancy but very clean, very thoughtful and the bed was super comfy. We were there for 2 nights during 3 straight days of rain so used the rainy days to head to Thermopolis State Park about 50 miles north for soothing hot springs soaks which we really loved…so much we even soaked again on our way to Cody before entering Yellowstone. Great and special spot."

After a bit I found the hosts (they were in their hot tub at the main house and stayed in to talk to me) and they pointed me generally in the right direction. Still - a map or some lights or signs would have been nice since the property is big and the granery is kind of hidden away in a corner behind a building. I'll also add that the internet didn't work in there at all and it was a bit loud overnight with the horses moving around right outside."

Stayed a few nights","Super cute place to stay. It felt like camping without having to sleep on the ground or go without AC. It even rained our first night there and the rain on the metal roof was so peaceful and calming. The location was great. It is about 15 mins outside of Riverton so you get the convenience of the town next door but you are far enough out to have the feeling of country living. The host was so sweet and nice. Also, our dog was able to run around free and explore. We loved “glamping” here."

We sat next to the horses and watched the sunset. We made a bonfire (Paulette was nice enough to help us start and maintain it) and enjoyed the stars and peace and quiet.

We ordered coffee from Java Java. They only deliver to businesses and due to this house being a Airbnb they were able to deliver us our coffee.😁 we end up extending our stay due to the comfort of the home.
We recommend purchasing through Casey! As we will be doing the same in the near future."

We did have an unfortunate incident with the smoke alarm starting a low battery chirp at 1:30am so it was too late to get help with it. Casey did respond in the morning and offered to send help to fix it, and also allowed us to stay past the check out time so we could sleep in a bit and take a slower morning since our night had been disrupted, so that was appreciated!"

Stayed over a week","Upon arrival I noticed the garage on the side of the house were guest are suppose to park is NOT connected to home. It looks like someone else could possibly stay there. Not an issue for some but it was for me. I always parked infront of the house. The inside of the house was decorated up to date. I do have to warn that there is only 1 tv inside the home that's sits in the living room. The washer dryer is located downstairsin a winding basement. I saw a few bugs, some dead, some alive here and there but thought maybe it's not that bad until I was washing cloths on my 6th day and mouse came out from under the dryer. I almost broke my neck running up those stairs. I informed airbnb and the host that same day. The host wanted her maintenance person to come over while I was there to spray and put something for mice down. I declined and said I wasn't comfortable having anyone over to the home because I'm a woman living there by myself and it's inappropriate. The host definitely needs to address the bugs and mouse issue. Other than that the house wasn't bad, the pest are just deal breakers for me!!"

One of the main selling points of this house was the hot tub. Not being able to use it was very disappointing. I would still recommend this place and stay again!
Thank you Casey!"

Stayed with kids","This is a basic, but very clean and functional rental. It was nice for our family to have a spacious place to rest on our road trip and do several loads of laundry. The house is clean and well kept, if economically furnished. Towels were fluffy and plentiful. We would stay here again if we were in the area again, though one thing I would change would be cotton sheets instead of polyester. Parking was easy, and there is a 110v outlet near the driveway if any EV users need a slow top off. The location is nice and there is grocery nearby, as well as many restaurants. We got some pizza that was excellent!"

Casey has a fully stocked kitchen and the jacuzzi was awesome we just didn't have time to really dive in.

The homes interior is outdated, which gave us the feeling of staying with an elderly family member.

The kitchen is equipped well and the gas grill got a thumbs up from the grillmaster. There are plenty of towels and blankets and the washer and dryer wirk well. Casey even supplies laundry detergent! The back deck was a nice place to sip coffee in the morning and has a fantastic awning for the hot afternoon. The neighborhood is quiet except for an occasional siren. There are good sidewalks for skateboarding and rollerblading and the lical grocery stores are well-sticked and close-by. The artwork in the house was nice too. I gave Casey's place all the stars. I especially appreciated the good communication and ease of check-in and check-out. It was a great value for the money!

Stayed with a pet","We had a wonderful time at Karen and Greg’s modern cabin. We were lucky to stay for almost a week after our time in Yellowstone. Greg and Karen were super responsive, helpful, and incredibly accommodating, especially given the unexpected rain we got while we were there. Greg helped guide us (with our 22 foot travel trailer) through the roads and over the bridge to and from the property. Our kiddos loved walking around and meeting and feeding the mules. The cabin was outfitted with everything you needed like paper plates, an ice cream scooper, spices for cooking, and a BBQ to grill! The chairs on the patio were great to watch the sunset. A big plus was that it was very dog friendly, as our pooch enjoyed playing frisbee on the property.
The cabin is beautiful, peaceful, well taken care of - it is a place to unwind, and be at home with the big skies, with town very close by. We had a super relaxing and fun time and can’t wait to come back to visit again."

This is a wonderful place to enjoy the nature in Wyoming right outside your door. Gregg went out of his way to assure we had everything we needed and then some. Due to a culvert washing out due to unusual rains, Gregg helped us find the back route in and, when more rains came, he found a safe place in town for our car and ferried us back and forth with our dogs whenever we wanted. With such comfortable accommodations, and beautiful surroundings at the cabin, we didn’t feel the need to leave very often. Hands down, the best AirBnb we have stayed."

It's located not too far from town, and is within two hours of fantastic hiking and anything else you might want to do when you're visiting. Karen and Greg are wonderful hosts: they respond quickly to messages, are generous with their suggestions, and provide a great stay. I really can't say enough good things.

The cabin and property was perfect for me and my dog. They give you free rein of the property, which is absolutely stunning, and had so much fun exploring and observing the wildlife. We spent most of our time down by the river, only a 15 minute walk from the cabin, and had a blast.
I enjoyed myself so much and felt so welcomed, I extended my stay. My family and I are even talking about coming back for a trip next year.
Thank you again, Greg and Karen, for sharing your gorgeous property with us and for being the best hosts ever. We’ll be back before you know it!"

The cabin decor, along with the surrounding acres, is the epitome of Wyoming. The hosts are generous in allowing guests to roam their many acres and enjoy the property. Also, it is within walking distance to the rails-to-trails Heritage Trail, which was enjoyable to walk or ride a bike on. It was exciting to drive over the nearby historical train bridges. The cabin is only 7 miles away from the town of Riverton so it was easy to go back-and-forth as needed. If you are looking for a relaxing stay in Wyoming, I highly recommend this cabin."

Not sure anyone can top the hospitality and comfort this beautiful home offered us in a hard time.
It had everything you could need!! They have truly put detail and love into making this a true home away from home. We had a private place to grieve and share memories. The neighborhood is great and quiet. Central to everything in riverton!!

Stayed with kids",We had a great stay at Casey's place. The location was great and central to what we were there for. It was close to restaurants and shopping. It was clean and had the space we needed. There was a toddler bed which was great. The kitchen was well stocked with what we needed. It was overall a great place to stay.

Stayed one night","Based on what you pay vs what you get, I don'tbelieve it was worth the price by a long shot, and normally, I don't leave any kind of negative reviews, but I've also not rented a place so far that had absolutely ZERO instructions about how to get to the place, no pics of what it looked like, and when trying to communicate with host, they offered nothing useful in the way of finding the home besides a photo, terribly inconvenient, they didn't respond back, and first thing in the morning after all this bull they wanted to know when I'd BE OUT after I paid almost 200 dollars for one night with a dirty tub that had a nasty body scum ring. hair under a nasty bath mat, and bedding that has the hint of urine smell, beyond disappointing I've never had this happen actually, rented 2 nights before this jn Saratoga, for a Fraction of the price, the beddn smelled amazing, and the host was fabulous, this one, I don't believe is up to air bnb standards myself"

Stayed with kids","This home has things that you need but certainly not stocked like other AirBnBs. There is only one heat exhaust in the living room, and a baseboard by the back door, and they do not warm up the entire house, especially in the room with the bonus room with a toddler bed in it. After contacting the host nothing was done. We had to get our own heater to keep that room warm enough for a kid to sleep in. There weren't even extra blankets to use, nor was any solution offered.
Bathroom is ok, but the showerhead is about at 5', the DW was broken (so dishes were dirty on arrival) and no private areas outside. The motion sensor lights (back and front) were so bright that it was not a fun experience to even stand outside. The back had an open carport with a bunch of items in it and an alleyway, so not a relaxing place to hang out. Maybe bring your own chairs and sit out front in the daylight.
I would not suggest this home when it's winter or for a lot of privacy."

Stayed a few nights","I think the nearly 5-star rating is not accurate for this accommodation. All in all it’s fine if you know what to expect.
Good things about this space: it was warm, the thermostat is accessible, beds were comfortable, basic cooking possible (e.g. scrambled eggs). The host is friendly and quick to respond.
Things that could have been better: not the greatest for children (no dinner table, no chairs, no smaller spoons or cups), the street is noisy (unlike the description), needs a little maintenance. There are several small discrepancies between the online directions and correspondence with the host (for example where to park), which can feel confusing. The bathroom door is not actually a door so be sure the people you stay here with are ok with hearing you poop. There was a used wine glass by the bed when we arrived.
All in all fine for a short stay in the area."

Unfortunately the first impressions were lasting. Weeds were growing up on the outside of the entry door, the carpet on the stairs up to the apartment had not been vaccumed and was covered in grass and pebbles and the hand rail was broken and held together with packing tape. Inside there was a hole in the wall next to bed patched with tape. a broken window and the bathroom door was so filthy from top to bottom on both sides that we cringed when we had to use it. The towels had long strands of hair on them and smelled musty."

We killed at least six leading to the room and later one inside. That is why the 4 star for clean, also the carpet on those stairs is rather dirty, but the room was clean. There was also a cat who wanted into our room every time we opened the door, so a heads up if you have cat allergies."

We loved that there was a small walled off bedroom so that 2+ people could sleep in the main space and another 2 could sleep in the smaller bedroom area. Beds were comfy, bathroom was spacious, and Raylene has provided several little thoughtful touches throughout the place. She was quick to respond to any questions/messages and she took great care of us before and during our stay. We would definitely book with her again. Thanks Raylene!

My son was very happy about the high quality toilet paper! Haha!
Thank you for the tip of downloading the Gypsy App for Yellowstone and The Grand Tetons. I’ve been to Yellowstone several times during my life and this App took us to places I’ve never been in Yellowstone.
I highly recommend Raylene’s apartment.
Thanks again. -Jenn"

Stayed a few nights","This is a charming, quaint spot! It’s nice and secluded while still having the comfort of just a couple of houses nearby.
The beds are so comfy and the appliances are new. Nice to have an in-unit washer/dryer for long term stays and just in general. Bathroom is very clean and shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel is provided!
Kitchen has just the right amount of items you would need, along with a dishwasher. My friend and I went to Smith’s (nice grocery store 5 min away) to load up on groceries/snacks and it was nice to have a fridge/freezer to store everything in (yay for our fruit and ice cream, respectively). It’s not the biggest TV, but you can angle it which is nice! The couch is quite comfy.
Maybe the most charming thing is the bird noises intermittently throughout the day! We heard owls often but unfortunately never saw one. A very cheerful and peaceful background noise. Also one night we heard some cows moo! It was simultaneously adorable and hysterical!
Side note:
-Was mildly amusing to open/close the chain on the gate whenever we left/returned. Not difficult at all, just didn’t expect it!"
