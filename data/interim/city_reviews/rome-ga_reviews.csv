Stayed with kids","This was a great place to stay for our vacation. We had 3 adults and 2 children and everybody was very comfortable. Lots of room to spread out, read, relax, play games, etc. Everything was clean and anything we needed was available. Lots to do within walking distance or a very short drive. The noise from the train was rough on our first night, but we used the white noise machine that we had brought and it was just fine after that."

The location was perfect, an easy walk to downtown and easy drive to anywhere in town. The unit was very nice and exceeded our expectations based on the pictures. It was very modern, clean, easy to find, and Melissa was great!"

We travelled from DE for the engagement and Melissa made our stay amazing. The house had everything we needed for the short stay. We were able to check in a little early to get ready for the event which was key. Thank you for a wonderful stay in Rome.

Stayed with kids","Our stay at Melissa's was perfect! It was so nice to have a covered place to park. It added both an easy way to unload and load every day with my children and an element of safety.
My 15yo appreciated the snacks when we arrived, as he had been playing ball all day, and it was a nice surprise to have something quick to grab as soon as we got it.
Everything was clean and beautiful. The couch and beds were comfortable, and there was plenty of space for everyone to go to their own space for a bit of peace and quiet. Having 2.5 bathrooms was definitely a bonus!
The kitchen was spacious and well equipped for me to make a full dinner for the family. The packets of condiments were another thoughtful surprise! My 5yo whom loves ketchup was very thankful!
My son loved the separate office to sneak away his younger brother and the closed in porch was lovely!
I would definitely recommend this home to anyone and will look for first if we are ever back in Rome!!"

Group trip","After hearing so many others bad experiences with Air B&B, I was very hesitant to rely on it for our wedding. But this property & Melissa restored my faith that this app has some amazing gems & hosts. The property itself was absolutely spotless. There was more than just the “basic” kitchen amenities & even board games for all ages. The space it very well laid out & we immediately felt right at home. It is cozy & coffee in the cool morning on the screened in porch was a true pleasure. The house is conveniently located just a couple blocks from the downtown area & we were able to walk there & back very quickly. We received amazing communication from Melissa. She knew we were in town for our wedding & left us a small cake as a congratulations. It was the sweetest gesture. We absolutely loved our stay & would stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed our stay and it more than satisfied all our needs. Was extremely convenient to the location we were using (Rome Tennis Center) and was a comfortable home. To be clear, the home appears to be an older home that has been reasonably touched up. So it comes with some character that comes with trying to touch up an older home without doing a full rebuild. But the coffee bar was great. The furniture in the living room was comfortable. All the beds were great and we had plenty of space for our use. Shower could use a little help, but again, didn't keep us from doing what we needed to do. Overall a very positive experience and would stay there again, no hesitation. Melissa was also very responsive before and throughout our stay. Thanks again!"

Christine was very quick to respond to any questions. Check-in & check-out were both very simple.

The house itself was nothing short of impeccable - it felt like we were the first guests to ever step inside, with every corner of the space sparkling clean and every amenity functioning perfectly.
But what truly set this experience apart was the stunning tennis court. It was an absolute dream for any tennis player!
However, the crown jewel of our stay was the hospitality shown by our hosts, James and Christina. They didn’t just provide us with a place to stay; they made us feel like part of their family. Their warmth and kindness were unparalleled, and they went above and beyond to ensure we had a great stay. This place is a rare gem that we cannot recommend highly enough."

The unit does sit right on the road, so traffic noise was a little annoying, but didn’t really impact sleep. The master bed is incredibly comfortable and the linens were soft and stylish. The shower has great water pressure and towels were conveniently stored. We didn’t cook at all, but the Keurig served us well! Becky was great with communication and flexible when we added our dog and one more person from the original reservation. The only detail that wasn’t 5 stars was the pet area and the yard. No one in the entire complex seems to clean up after their dogs. We just walked our dog elsewhere. Definitely wouldn’t even have noticed if we hadn’t had our dog with us. Otherwise - fantastic experience -we are already booked to stay again for Berry Graduation."

Stayed with a pet","Wow!! Above and beyond on all levels. Communication was amazing, location was amazing, very clean, comfortable, cozy, inviting and was so easy to rest and relax while watching current TV selections without having to stream. So many personal touches, and extras that make you feel special and want to come back. Very nicely decorated and updated. Parking can be a little challenging and when it is raining the sidewalks are full of water it poured when we pulled up, but drains pretty quickly. Great to have front and back door access and cute little patio to sit and chill on opening up to a courtyard with doggie ""park"" for the fur babies. Nice quite complex. You do have to walk from the parking lot to the condo, not far but you can't park in front of the unit. Great comfy lounging couch, great king size bed and all the extras you need:: huge closet, hangers, HE Washer/Dryer, everything you would need in the kitchen to cook even though we didn't use it to cook. Beautiful warm decor, and small personal touches that really add to the space. Extra 1/2 bath/toilet would be nice downstairs but not sure how that could be done. Becky has thought of everything to make your stay very comfortable and you're planning on already coming back before you even check out!!! There are large dogs next door that can get a little loud, we used a sound machine to mask the barking so our Bella would not bark back. Becky had extra cozy blankets for us and Bella, a clean dog bed, doggie toys ( how thoughtful) and doggie bowls. Nice large dining table to eat at. The listing is very accurate on the amenities. You will enjoy your stay. She is very quick to respond to any request and easy check in. We will be back!! Thanks again Becky for making our stay amazing and restful in Rome!!"

The house is close to a busy road, if you are a light sleeper you should bring something to cover the road noise. All in all a good stay and I would return. Host replies quickly with any questions and is nice."

Laura offered the house early to us as soon as cleaning was done, but we didn’t need to because we got in late. The yard was freshly mowed and landscaping was beautiful. Would definitely stay here again if we were in the area. The little touches of snacks, ice, K-cups and toiletries was a very nice touch!!! You can tell that Laura takes great care in hosting! The only issue we had was very minor but the front porch light was burned out so made the entrance really dark for our visit. It was just a minor inconvenience. Great house with a top notch host!

The home was spotless and cozy. My animals enjoyed the fenced backyard. It is close to everything you need in very quiet neighborhood. I would definitely book again. Highly recommend!"

The layout of the house is nice and would be great for family’s and people with pets.

Stayed a few nights","Super clean, charmingly decorated home. We stayed while visiting relatives on a very busy trip and Laura's place was such a haven of peace and quiet. Good sized rooms, lovely touches everywhere from the incredible array of welcome snacks and coffee/tea, to the cute signs that bring a smile to your face. There are a few areas of the home that have a little retro feel, but the majority has a modern feel and is decorated simply and beautifully. I loved the keycode door, no concerns over losing keys and dealing with lockboxes. The bedrooms are bright and clean and fresh, and the beds are EXTREMELY comfortable. I would have liked to take the mattress home with me, we slept like logs every night, all three beds have the same quality of mattress. My daughter (10) absolutely loved staying there, I think it just had a lovely feel and she happily sat at the kitchen table using the colouring books and crayons that were kindly available.
While we were staying the Keurig coffee machine stopped brewing, I sent a text to let Laura know and when I returned the next afternoon a new machine was waiting for me, which was just fantastic. Laura was so lovely to communicate with before, during and after our stay. We had such a great stay; I wouldn't hesitate to rebook and my daughter has already asked if we are staying at Laura's again when we return!"

There was only bare minimum towels for 8 guests. 8 towels, 8 washcloths and 2 hand towels for the whole weekend for 8 guests. There was no remote for the TV in one of the bedrooms. To make this listing better it needs to list what sizes the beds are in each bedroom and whether or not there is a hair dryer. Most places provide at least one. Also, more towels. The beds need to be provided with 4 pillows each. And there was no closet in the master bedroom."

It's a 4 bedrooms home but had to share closet space with 2 other rooms because the master bedroom had closet locked as if unavailable for guest to use and the room with twin beds just doesn't have closet or place to set suitcases. Other than that it was perfect for our group in town for a wedding. Thank you"

No issues with hot water but we did have a big group so nothing unexpected.
There was some hotel style shampoo and soap that was at the sink but nothing major. Most people bring their own toiletries anyways.

Stayed one night","The space is accurate to the pictures, check in was easy and host was responsive, the neighborhood was peaceful and quiet, and you can tell was recently renovated with fairly new furniture. The issue with this is with a new renovation, there was a layer of dust around the entire house likely from the vents. Kitchen did not have any pots, pans, or baking sheets. The biggest issue we had was there was absolutely no hot water our entire stay and we could not access a breaker panel or hot water heater to try and fix the problem."

Beds were comfortable. Location was quiet and peaceful. We would return if the occasion presents the need. Yashika was ver responsive to our messages.

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at Yashika's place was excellent! The home was very clean, organized and everything was new :) TVs are in every room, the beds were comfortable, and the neighborhood was peaceful. She also provided necessities in the bath and kitchen; including seasonings and snacks. I would have liked a little more water pressure, but the steaming hot water made up for it. Don't be intimidated by the hills on the drive up, the driveway is not too steep and allows for at least four cars/suvs. My family said it felt like home an we would definitely stay here again!"

Grocery store and restaurants on the way and close to house. The beds were comfortable and the neighborhood very quiet. Access to house was quick and easy. We loved that there were TV’s in all the bedrooms and that the streaming services were set up prior to our arrival so that we didn’t have to log in to the apps we wanted to watch. Very thoughtful! Stefanee was quick to respond with a solution to a problem we had accessing local TV channels. Thank you Stefanee!

Stayed with kids","This was our second stay here, and it was clean and comfortable. The historical charm of the house is wonderful. The location is also great because you can easily walk along the river to the downtown area.
A few things to know…the internet speed is very slow, so if you’re needing to work while there, be ready to use your own data.
The shower in the master bathroom was leaking and had tape on the inside. We communicated with Stephanee to let her know and were told it was scheduled for repair. Might have been better to let us know in advance though as it was a pretty major leak. However, She was very quick to respond, and we had enough towels to clean it up.
The only other issue we had was lack of toilet paper. There were five us staying there and only 2 rolls of toilet paper, so it didn’t last long😂"

Stayed a few nights","When we arrived, we contacted Stefanee to see if we could check in a little early. She promptly returned our call and was very nice and gracious.
The cottage is located in a nice, quiet historic part of town with plenty of off-street parking. The location was convenient to all of the places that we wanted to visit. It was very clean, and the beds, comfortable. The dining and living areas were large, and there was plenty of seating. The cottage contained everything we needed, and we had no issues. There were four of us staying here – all adults, and we would definitely want to stay here again."

Stayed with kids","We loved the location, the ability to walk to the downtown area, and the coziness of the neighborhood. We felt safe and ""at home."" The house was spacious enough for our family of six, but small enough for us to bond over meals and card games at night. Rome's downtown area was close enough that we walked there several times during the week. The neighborhood was quiet at night with little traffic and noise. The snacks and water helped greatly after our evening runs at the park across the river. The house was modernized to equip our technology needs but also had the architecture and charm of the early 1900s."

The front porch and its swing makes for good relaxation time in the fresh air. The kitchen is fully equipped and spacious. The whirlpool bath in the hall bathroom worked great and the bubbles made it most enjoyable. Each bedroom has a TV and the beds were soft and comfortable, lots of pillows. A coffee station in the kitchen had both coffee and hot cocoa to make and enjoy and a small basket of snacks were perfect after arriving in late one evening. We were able to walk to the downtown area, visit shops, take pictures of historic sites and enjoy a coffee at Swift and Finch. The price isn't much more than a hotel and you get so much more space, full kitchen, whirlpool bath and privacy. Your dollar is best spent on a place like this one, it's comfy. We had an enjoyable stay and confidently recommend to others."

Group trip","There are cameras watching you on the porches. And they are not just there for security. The owner is monitoring them. It was very creepy to me that she was watching my children play on the porch.
My brother and his kids came by before we went out to dinner for my dad’s birthday. Because we were all on the front porch, the owner called Airbnb and made us leave due to “too many guests”. This was extremely inconvenient and unfair.
My thought is that this owner should find another thing to do with the property. They clearly don’t want people staying in their house and will do things to make your stay unpleasant. I strongly recommend finding another place to stay. Otherwise you may have to find another place last minute when she kicks you out.
DO NOT STAY HERE."

The location is perfect - close to anything you need and really convenient for walking into town. Rome is very special to us as my mom graduated from Berry College in the 50’s. We enjoyed our visit to campus and our time in Rome and highly recommend this home. The big tub in the hall bathroom is wonderful and big enough to really enjoy a good soak. The beds were more comfortable than the bed and breakfast we stayed in in south Georgia so we welcomed our good nights sleeps. The house was clean and nicely decorated and had nice conveniences like water bottles in the fridge. And the fire flies were fun to see in the back yard! Oh - and the instant hot water was great with 5 adults and 2 kids showering - we never ran out of hot water. All around a ten in my book!

My only regret is that we didn’t get another day to do that walk again. My favorite time was sitting on the porch swing at night - lots of To Kill a Mockingbird vibes haha. I did need to contact the manager and she was so helpful and kind and took care of us right away (nothing their fault just a weird fluke). I hope we can come back one day!"

It has that feel of a cozy cabin nestled in the woods and it’s just what we wanted. Cindy is proactive with instructions and updates about stuff on her property. Cindy also responds quickly with any questions you have. We will continue to come back year after year!

Cindy's place was incredible beautiful, and in a relaxing wooded area that was still within a reasonable distance from Rome, GA. We enjoyed our stay here with 3 little ones. We didn't use many of the amenities, but they are numerous and go above and beyond what is listed in the description. I saw board games, tons of folding chairs, and even a pack and play. Great great place!"

But our stay at Dogwood Creek was very comfortable. Cindy did a really nice job renewing this period house, and it's clean and nicely furnished. We were on the go a lot during our two-night stay but it was a pleasant place to return to at night. We'd be happy to return."

Stayed about a week","Beds: Gel memory foam mattresses, nice protectors (not crinkly plastic ones), bedding was clean, tons of warm fuzzy blankets. Best sleep!
Linens_ Ample towels and toiletries!
Water Pressure was AMAZING! Great water heater, phenomenal dishwasher!
Kitchen: Spectacular supply! crockpot, mixer, tons of pans and containers that made eating in and enjoying time with family such a breeze!
Internet was used heavily as I work online and had No connection issues when I had to log in. Cell phone coverage was minimal (AT&T) But wi-fi calling worked just fine.
Beautiful yard with plenty of space to enjoy.
Hopefully next time we return it will be summer so we can enjoy the pool!
Highly recommend this place! I have stayed with many vacation rentals and this was one of my favorites!"

Stayed a few nights","Cindy's place was perfect for a long weekend away with my husband. The home is welcoming and had everything we needed to have a nice relaxing reset.
The home is exactly as described. The kitchen was well stocked with all the pots, pans, and utensils needed to cook a meal.
The pool was still open when we went and was clean and clear when we arrived. A generous supply of pool / beach towels were also available. Make sure to bring sandals when going out to the pool as there is a small walk across the driveway to enter the pool. The pool was private with plenty of sun and shade.
There was plenty of outdoor lounging space on the front and back porch and around the pool. There was a firepit in the front and a standing outdoor fireplace in the back and wood for both.
The location isn't too close to the hustle and bustle of the city but close enough for a trip to Broad St to see some of what Rome has to offer for visitors.
We really enjoyed our stay and look forward to going back!"

We are interested in living down South and Cindy went above and beyond to provide information on the city: schools, housing, restaurants. The time she took with me was so much appreciated.
The house had every amenity including pods for laundry and dishwasher.
We will be back! If we are not lucky enough to grab this place, we will definitely seek out her other Air BnBs!!"

The door under the kitchen sink won’t close and the bathroom ceiling dripped half a pail of water when it rained. We placed a bucket over the toilet, which caught the rainfall. Pretty cute bcuz I love old things but undesired. Back patio furniture and the chairs around the fire pit outside in the front hadn’t been cleaned 4 a while. Overall great stay, awesome views, and beautiful architecture but needs some work. Also, living area has a wasp nest, which my grandkids were obsessed with. It’s natural considering the location but something needs to be done to control wasps on the inside"

Stayed with a pet","Quirky and eclectic vibe. Great location to downtown. Perfect if you like a walkable location to everything. Apartment is in an old historic building so issues can arise such as low water pressure, outside noise, A/C issues. Also, if you are bringing small children or a pet, there are about 20 stairs to navigate from the entrance to the main level. Our dog is older and doesn't navigate stairs, so we had to carry him up and down. One thing to note, is that almost ever room has a skylight. If you are an early riser, it won't be a problem, but if you like to sleep in, after 7am the master bedroom becomes pretty bright. Hosts are responsive during normal operating hours."

From the pictures it’s hard to tell that the location has several floor-ceiling mirrors. They’re beautiful and good to keep in mind during the night so that you don’t scare yourself. The pictures do not do justice to how beautiful the space is. The wood and brick give the historic space such a wonderful charm and the stain glass windows let in a magical light into the master bathroom. Plus, the Airbnb is located directly above a quiet coffee shop run by the friendliest staff! 11/10!"

It is an apartment on top of a business, so you will hear some noise during business hours, but that is offset by the wonderful smell of bacon cooking, and the provided sound machines help drown out any ambient noise during sleeping. The place is definitely historic, but the age adds to the charm rather than detracting. A very unique space, and a fun place to stay. Adults and children were all excited about it. If we ever visit Rome again, we will definitely want to stay here again. 2 adults, 3 children (9,7,4)."

Massive master bedroom and shower/bath, cute outdoor terrace, and there was a gate installed at the stairs already! I brought a gate just in case so this was a super bonus!
We didn’t have to drive at all on the day of the event because of the location, everything was walkable! Hosts were very communicative and provided instructions. The entrance of the place is in an odd location, but once we found it, it was easy to spot.
Would definitely recommend, what a very cool place to stay.

We live in a downtown area so we are NOT impacted by street noise. However, my in-laws are not in the same boat. It wasn’t awful, but MIL mentioned the noise a few times. I don’t think it was awful, but the venue across the street was having an Indian wedding, so the music was loud and……interesting. Ha. But aside from the volume and downtown street noise (which is perfectly normal for a downtown location) the place was awesome!!!!"

I apologized to my aunt before I got there about the stairs we would have to climb but they were not steep & so easy for all of us to navigate even bringing our stuff in & departing. We would DEFINITELY stay there again. Loved it!!

The master bed and bath was nice and large. Loved the outdoor patio. We even had a clock tower view. Very convenient to everything. We walked to La Scala restaurant where we celebrated my 60th birthday which is one of the reasons we chose the place off broad. Brittney was great and very responsive to emails. We would stay here again. Thanks 💚

Group trip","This is a lovely place with some great amenities. We especially enjoyed the deck with the corn hole game. The location is perfect for exploring downtown Rome, including the river walk.
It is definitely not for small kids or folks with any issues getting up and down the stairs.
While the host does disclose that the nightlife in Rome is very active, if you are there on a weekend be prepared for VERY late night noise as this place is 2 doors down from a nightclub. Also, the hosts do not disclose that they hold a church service in the basement on Sunday from 9 am-noon. And honestly, it is quite loud with piano music, singing and preaching. Now, many people might be up and out the door by 9 am and would not be disturbed by this. But our group members are late sleepers and enjoy our coffee time. I just think this should be disclosed as it may have affected our decision on booking the place.
Sunday evening and Monday morning were quiet. So I would stay here again on weekdays."

Stayed a few nights","Quite possibly the cleanest AirBnB I've ever stayed at - the place was spotless. Great location, easy access to walk around downtown Rome. A two minute drive to grocery+gas. Awesome, friendly, communication from the host - I had a question that was answered really fast.
Very unique interior - stained glass windows, copper throughout, skylights, exposed brick. Loved the historic feel of the place.
You can park for 3 hours a day on the street parking, and they do enforce this (looked like an attendant does loops around the area with license plate readers). Pro tip here is that you can park after 6PM and then have until 11 AM the next day to move (8 AM starts the clock, so you get 3 hours). Other than that, there is a very convenient parking deck that's maybe a 90 second walk away (walk left out the door and you cannot miss it). Download the ParkMobile App and it's really convenient and easy, and not a bad price (I think I paid $4 for some 7 hours of parking over the weekend, and max is $8/day)."

Stayed a few nights","I’d give six stars if I could. This place is overflowing with personality and character. And it’s comfortable! This is a downtown loft with the entrance in the back and convenient parking in a nearby garage. I recommend downloading the app for the parking garage to make it simpler to pay. Yes you will hear ambient downtown sounds - people talking,laughing, cars, music - but it was not at all disturbing for us.
The place cleverly places the (large, luxurious, jaw dropping) bathroom at the front facing the street so the rooms where you spend the most time are quieter. Bonus: there was a man playing saxophone across the street both evenings of our stay and it made for incredible atmosphere, especially for soaking in the tub.
The rooms are very spacious with very high ceilings. There are skylights in most rooms, so if you like a dark room in which to sleep in this may not be the best choice for you, but I loved it. The hosts provided white noise machines to help diffuse the ambient city noise but honestly it was not bad during the weekend we stayed. I was not disturbed at all. (Take ear plugs if you have concerns about this!)
Coffee is always necessary for us, and the hosts provide a great one cup machine that uses pods or grounds. So be sure to bring your favorite coffee with you. They even have a French press if you prefer.
The bedding is fantastic, especially the pillows! The mattress in the master is somewhat firm, but very comfortable. The hosts are very kind, welcoming, and quick to respond. We would most definitely stay here again."

Stayed with a pet","There are some wonderful amenities including location to downtown for the apartment but renters considering this location should be aware it is located 2 storefronts from Peaches which is a rowdy concert venue. A band playing until midnight or 2am depending on the night would not be in my opinion as the description says downtown noise. While you do not hear the sounds of people you will hear the bass instruments if trying to sleep. If you’re coming to enjoy the nightlife and coming home after partying then it’s probably not going to be an issue (be aware no alcohol is allowed in the apartment if you are a rule follower). However if you are expecting to sleep in the master anytime before midnight even a white noise app didn’t mask the background beats of the band. Car engine comes and goes, people talking and laughing while walking by…those to me are downtown noises…
Also not shared…street parking is free from 6pm until 8am the next morning which then starts a 3 hour time limit. Useful information if you are moving your car before 11am the next morning and don’t want to park a block away in the garage.
Dog walking trails are conveniently located and it’s fun to be near downtown. Just be aware of the reality of the location and potential for sleep disruption when making a decision about where to stay. You can check the concert schedule on Peaches web site…wish I had known before spending so much money to book a place leaving me sleep deprived."

It was wonderful that everyone had their own bed, multiple tvs, 2 bathrooms, and loved the dining room that was tucked away if someone needed a quiet spot for themselves. Very clean. Really enjoyed the Roku tvs! We didn’t need the kitchen as we ate out but it was fully equipped! Thank you for great stay."

Stayed with a pet","Kiesha was a wonderful and responsive host, her place was very clean, homey, and super easy to find. Entry instructions were easy to follow. Appreciated the farm fresh welcome eggs, they were delicious and it was such a fun surprise!
Our only concerns were that the home was right on the road, but it was not a busy street so it stayed fairly quiet and the curtains in the bedrooms easily blocked out headlights from passing cars at night. Additionally the floors inside the home are uneven and change elevation from room to room. My grandma had a bit of trouble getting around but it was nothing severe - just a heads up for anyone traveling with mobility difficulties.
Would recommend this place and would stay here again if I travel to the area in the future!"

Stayed with a pet","This is our 2nd time staying in the home and we loved it yet again! This place makes you feel right at home and it was nice staying somewhere familiar again. It was the perfect drive from downtown and not noisy at all considering it’s right by the road.
Side note, like I said previously we stayed here, which was a year ago. I had left my pillow at the home and let the host know. My boyfriend was supposed to get it from her but we had forgotten about it since it was a year ago. We get there and my pillow is in a sealed bag on the bed! She saved it for me after a year. If that doesn’t tell you how considerate Keisha is then I don’t know what will. She also allowed us to check out late which helped us so much!
We’ll be back sometime soon!!!"

The house is so cute! It has little imperfections that add to its charm. We visited the farm animals on the homeowners property just a short walk away. Their 10 year old son gave us a guided tour of the property and introduced us to every animal by name. There is a fishing pond on the property so if you fish, bring your pole. Would I stay here again? Absolutely! I hope I was as great a guest as the family is a host."

Stayed with kids","This was my family's first Airbnb experience. The home did fit our needs. We have family a member who's in a wheelchair. The home was accessible, one level with no stairs. This was a major draw for us along with price. Even though the home looks tiny on the outside it was very spacious on the inside. We had plenty space for the five of us. The host and her family were very welcoming. We did have some concerns arise. I was able to contact Kiesha and she promptly addressed our concerns. She was very pleasant and helpful. She and her family help made our stay pleasant as well. We enjoyed their peaceful and budding farm. I do want to mention that home is located on a busy street and can be noisy at times. If you're considering staying here. That is something to take into consideration. We are excited to see how this property will progress in the future 😀."

Pros:
--Great host who responds immediately and who goes the extra mile to ensure a pleasant stay
--Super easy check-in and check-out
--The beds were incredibly comfortable with pillow-top pad and memory foam mattress
--Close drive to downtown Rome and Berry College campus
Cons:

Stayed a few nights","This place just isn't ready for prime time. I'll do a pro/con list:
Pros: we were the first people to stat here (i think) so everything was brand new, has a good amount of space, pretty good furnishings and appliances (though missing washer/ dryer), check-in was smooth.
Cons: it's a very old house. Some of the windows are the original single-pane, there's a couple holes in the floor and walls, the water runs brown at first from the old pipes, and there's a constant musty odor in the place.
Conclusion : it's homey and spacious, but it needs some work to make it to a 4 or 5 star stay."

I didn’t know how much I would appreciate the cold water in the fridge until I arrived at 2 AM from Atlanta and was dying of thirst. Felt very safe in the neighborhood., there was a neighborhood dog that barked every morning however, I would expect nothing less in a neighborhood. We enjoyed spending time on the screened in porch.

Stayed a few nights","Overall, this is a good place to stay if you're Visiting Rome. There were no major issues with the house, other than some minor maintenance items that Maria addressed.
Just two things to keep in mind :
1) This is an older house and the heating system is pretty dusty. It wasn't a problem for me, but my son had pretty bad allergy and sinus symptoms whenever we were in the house.
2) The only parking is on the street, and it's a very narrow street. Fine for most vehicles, but if you drive a large vehicle, it's something to keep in mind. Even with my compact car, the garbage truck was could just barely get by.
Other than that, I found it convenient and pleasant."

Stayed a few nights","Maria's House is a charming older home that has been beautifully restored in a quiet neighborhood. The next door neighbors do have a couple of large dogs. The dogs were quiet unless I was in the back yard. The home is pristinely clean and had some nice Halloween decorations set out. Maria was very responsive to my messages. I would defiantly stay here again. Some info for that may be helpful for future guests: The appliances and heating are gas, not electric. The stairs going down into the fenced back yard are very steep. Due to rain during most of my stay these steps stayed wet and covered with wet leaves keeping them pretty slippery. There is a train somewhere near by you will hear at night. It is faintly off in the distance, but did wake me up a couple of times. The mattresses are on the softer side, but comfortable."

Stayed a few nights","The whole house is comfortable , clean and a safe ""at home"" type of neighborhood that gives the full Rome, GA experience. From all of the, new appliances, outside-enclosed porch swing, wifi, to 3 tv's this a home away from home feeling place. I will always look for this place when visiting Rome."

Stayed a few nights",Maria's place was very clean and comfortable for my stay. I had the whole house to myself! I slept well thanks to the tempurpedic mattress and quiet neighborhood. I hate that the weather was cold this time of year or I would have taken advantage of her patio and sunroom.
