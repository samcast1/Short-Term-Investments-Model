I was there to move my daughter into her dorm at MVC it was a 30 second drive. Also very close to the town square and Walmart.
Very clean, very quite and easy check in process as door has a code. Definitely highly recommend."

Arrow Rock is just down the road and is a beautiful town, too.
This house is a nice place to stay - comfortable beds - we were a family of 4 and enjoyed the space."

The kitchen was stocked with everything we needed to cook and enjoy spending time with my son. The beds and pillows were extra comfortable and a nice change from the discomfort of hotel beds. The washer and dryer were a nice plus and she even included the detergent. I would highly recommend this property to anyone visiting the Marshall area. I would definitely stay with this host again next time I come in town."

Stayed a few nights","I assisted my parents on a trip ""back home"" for 5 days. We truly enjoyed our trip and the accommodations were nice, much better than a hotel room. Jenna was very kind about allowing us to have friends and family visit with us at the house. With my father in advanced stages of dementia, having people come to us helped him feel more at home. Jenna has a 5* airbnb in the works! It is a work in progress, but I know they will make it beautiful. One note: STEPS!there is one bedroom on the 1st floor. If you are elderly or have small children, you should not attempt the steps to the 2 bedrooms upstairs. Also there are steps, some without rails, at all entrances to the house."

Stayed one night","Shari's place was great! We were just passing through on our way to our final destination in TN. We wish we could have stayed for a longer period of time. Finding out that the place was a complete apartment after a very long day of traveling was great! I thought that we would be sharing the living room and kitchen with the rest of the household.
The house is old with a tremendous amount of character. It is very comfortable with a full kitchen, very easy to travel with your own food. Shari has left a few amenities in case you have forgotten anything. Very thoughtful touches! Check with Chris by phone was quick and easy. They both give excellent ideas for dining in the area.
The ""Town Square"" where most restaurants and cafes were located is a short one block walk away, very convenient and friendly. We thoroughly enjoyed our overnight stay and will be back when we are passing through again!"

Stayed a few nights","This location was super convenient for exploring parents’ hometowns. Break of Dawn cafe is in walking distance and has yummy food! But for breakfast we liked the convenience of making our own coffee and not rushing out in the morning. :) Full fridge was great so we could travel with groceries. Condiments provided which was wonderful since we forgot our mayo! One of my favorite things was not a bunch of check out rules. Like leaving a hotel, we were not asked to take out trash and do dishes. Although we would have done our few dishes if there had been a dish rack and if the sink were not draining so slowly. This Airbnb is not far from I-70. Very convenient and quaint."

On-site amenities include wi-fi, full kitchen (full-size coffee pot is a nice touch), and - perhaps the best things - a fresh loaf of homemade coffee cake, which is absolutely delicious. The hosts are prompt, very helpful, and responsive."

Well now next year I will book Kitty’s Corner in advance. A historic home that was very clean with its own sitting area with TV, separate bedroom, full kitchen and bathroom. Shari and Chris gave their cell phone number so we could easily communicate by text. The tournament didn’t end until 11pm and all the restaurants were closed. There was a delicious cinnamon bunt cake waiting for me at soon as I walked in the door. Thank you Shari and Chris for the hospitality. See you next year."

It was clean, beautiful decor, and there were small touches and extras that made it more than we hoped for. Such as snacks, a few water bottles already cold in the fridge, plenty of k cup options for coffee, and cinnamon rolls that looked homemade awaiting our arrival, which we enjoyed for breakfast. Brad took the time to call and walk us through the steps needed when we had a minor hiccup trying to watch an important football game."

Stayed a few nights","Everything about this house was awesome, except for one thing. There were so many air fresheners and everything in the house had a strong smell of artificial fragrance. There were five super strong oil plugins in this small house. I even unplugged all of them when I got there and it didnt help much. It was gross. I don't have any type of medical condition, but I'm sensitive to artificial chemical fragrance. I don't use that stuff in my house. If you dont have issues with fragrance, then you should definitely stay in this house. It's great and has everything you'll need. If you do have issues with it, steer clear and go somewhere else."

Surprised us with some home-made cinnamon rolls. LOVE.
We made sure to take in local eateries such as Dempsey's BBQ, El Patron Mexican Restaurant and Cree-Mee Freeze for a flurry. Everything was delicious! We also visited The Cheese Store in the next town over for some locally made cheese. Cute store. Even grabbed a few pumpkins from a local resident, on our way back to town.

The house itself is thoughtfully decorated in a country farm-house style and immaculately clean. The porch was a nice place to hang out in the warm weather. The kitchen was well outfitted with spices, oil and vinegar and condiments in the refrigerator. They provided an extra toothbrush and toothpaste in the bathroom, as well as a first aid kit. The beds were a little firmer than we are used to, but fine. The photos do not do real justice to the overall pleasing atmosphere. We would definitely stay here again when in the area."

Brad's place had everything you need. He was and is a great communicator and very responsive. We actually chatted before my stay to be sure places were open after the COVID 19 scare. This little town has everything you need for a quiet stay."

In all seriousness, this was a great place to stay and the amenities were far and above my expectations. Definitely see myself coming back."

The restriction on visitors was very off putting. We rented the house for a graduation and wanted to have a place to sit with family, hence getting an AirBnB instead of a hotel room. They “made an allowance” for my graduating nephew to visit for a few hours while waiting for dinner. Just felt very unwelcome to actually use the rental, outside of just sleeping."

Group trip","This is a beautiful hidden gem! The home is located just a few minutes from Missouri Valley College. The home is nicely decorated and very clean. You will enjoy all the nature around you! I was concerned about other reviews that complained about things, but that must have been because they were breaking the rules. We had no problems at all! The host was very responsive to any questions we had. The upstairs is a master suite with a jacuzzi tub which was definitely appreciated after our long drive there. One thing to note is the master bathroom is open to the bedroom so not much privacy in the upstairs. The sunroom was wonderful to enjoy drinking your coffee on cold mornings! We saw lots of beautiful birds in a nest with perfectly blue robin eggs, a woodpecker, a baby skunk, squirrels and butterflies! It was very serene. The tree swing was so much fun, from our 2 year old Grandaughter when she came to visit to our 80 year old grandma! Lots of laughs for all. If you can respect the rules of the owners and appreciate the beauty all around, then this place is a must! Will definitely rent again when we return!"

Only noises at night are the tree frogs outdoors and any other guests that you brought walking around the house. If planning on cooking in the kitchen, probably need to bring your own supplies.

Stayed with kids",We were gave excellent directions and greeted by a plate of yummy cookies and a very clean place. We enjoyed ourselves immensely and we had everything we needed.. The coffee was great and there were fish in the pond. It is the best place to be to enjoy time with family in such a beautiful setting. Directions were detailed about everything inside so we were never unsure about anything or how it worked. It was a great evening of relaxation with no worries about anything. I loved our time and wound love to return.❤

Stayed a few nights","A nice place in a quiet farm area. Overall, a good place to stay for UCM graduation weekend. Just a few tips to note:
*If you have to get up in the middle of the night to use the restroom, the stairs can be a little tricky. Might not be the best place if you have mobility issues or get up frequently at night.
*The mattress is not the most comfortable (we are used to a Tempur-Pedic). You might also bing your own pillows...these are pretty flat.
*You might ask if they are currently experiencing a drought when you plan to go. If they are, obviously the pond will be low but more notably, the water inside the house will have a strong sulfur smell. This made any function associated with water an unpleasant experience. They did provide bottled water in the fridge, but you might want to bring a case if you drink a lot or plan to be there more than a few days."

Stayed a few nights","Beautiful. Clean. Peaceful. Amenities were perfect. Our daughter was getting married at Simple Blessings Farm and it was 2 miles away.
Jon was helpful and responsive.
Only 2 things I’d change:
1) lights at the driveway entrance. We missed it twice.
2) a memory foam mattress pad for the fold out. For $200 per night for 4 people, it is worth it as long as everyone can sleep comfortably.
Thank you."

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at Jon's cabin was very enjoyable. Beautiful, peaceful setting. Comfortable and clean. Highly recommended!
I was glad we arrived during daylight - it could be tricky at night. Recommend approaching from the east so you have a chance of seeing the number on the mailbox. Once you've figured it out coming back is easier. I was handicapped by using an older GPS which hadn't been updated for a while because my newer one was acting up when we were leaving the house."

Stayed a few nights","A wonderful and peaceful place to stay! Jon, the host, was very proactive with his communication and attentiveness to the space. He even stopped by to salt the outside steps when it began to snow during our stay, and alerted us of the potentially slippery stairs. The amenities were exactly as described in the listing, and the photos were very accurate. The gas fireplace was one of our favorite aspects of this place! During our stay, the drought conditions had caused the water to become slightly sulfurous, but Jon left several bottles of water in the refrigerator for us to use. My only wish is that we could have known this ahead of time, so that we could have packed more waters with us for the trip (he had plenty in the fridge--we just are people that drink lots of water!!). Overall a great place, and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a peaceful and quiet getaway."

Stayed with kids","I surprised my family with this stay for Christmas and we were all blown away. We couldn’t stop complimenting the place and scenery. Everything was top notch from the amenities to the service and even homemade cookies. The kitchen has EVERYTHING and anything you need was in this place. The view was spectacular and surreal I couldn’t believe something so magical was in the Midwest. We didn’t want to leave. Bedtime stories in front of a fireplace, feed for the fishes in the lake, the upper level patio at night to see ALL the stars. We loved this place. If you’re looking for a magical place to spend away from the city life and completely relax this is it! Thanks again Jon for being a highlight in my families memories for years to come."

Stayed a few nights","Cozy, clean, and peaceful... absolutely perfect. The cabin is adorable and well made. Jon and Edna really paid to attention to small details to make it extra inviting... kitchen well stocked with cooking utensils, plethora of towels/linens, firewood for the fire pit, some toiletry items, and delicious fresh-baked cookies!
The setting is peaceful. It took me back to growing up on my grandparents farm. Even with the water level low on the pond, we enjoyed gazing at the water and caught few fish! And, the views!!! The sunrise over the water, the sunset from the upper back deck were breathtaking and, on a clear night, the star gazing is incredible!
It was the perfect way recharge and we can't wait return someday."

The only drawback (a very minor one) was caused by mother nature...a local drought has lowered the pond level a bit and caused the well water to be slightly odiferous. The host provided bottled water, even though the tap water was very drinkable.
At sunset, we enjoyed watching a heron hunting in the pond for it's dinner!"

Wish we had a few more days to stay, but we were just passing through for the night trying to get back home.

We randomly found the listing for this cabin and it was just so lovely...just as described. The space is open and cosy at the same time. The cabin seems newly and skillfully constructed and each area is very well appointed. The setting was perfectly private & peaceful for our writing and rehearsal retreat. We were able to take breaks and do some pleasant laps around the wee lake. Everything we were looking for. Can't speak more highly of our experience.

The place was spotless. There were cookies and snacks waiting for us when we arrived. The deck area off the pond was beautiful. There were a couple puzzles stashed away that we enjoyed putting together. We watched the sunrise in the raised deck of the bedroom, wrapped in blankets, and drinking coffee. It was great. The only advice I have for a traveler coming here would be to bring some extra pillows. The bed isn’t the most comfortable and I think a few extra fluffy pillows would have helped us sleep better. Overall would definitely recommend this spot to others!"

We spent a lot of time hiking all of the beautiful trails of Knob Noster State Park and we looked forward to coming back to the cabin to relax and play games. The cabin is built with a lot of love and is located on a beautiful pice of land. Jon and his wife are incredibly thoughtful and kind. Jon shared a homemade meal of fresh cinnamon rolls and sausage with us. So decadent and delicious! We are so appreciative that Jon supplied freshly cut wood and firepit essentials.

Stayed a few nights","If you are an Air BNB treasure hunter, this is a treasure. Jon and Edna have thoughtfully created a zen environment where you can unplug and reconnect. If TVs and the such are necessary, this is not your place. We plugged into the Wi-Fi and enjoyed music and conversation. It’s a place where social media and meanness does not exist.
The layout is serious, do not bring toddlers or young children. The spiral staircase was fun enough for adults walking out of the rest room.
That said, bring your necessities in terms of seasonings for cooking, sugar/sweetener for coffee. Also, if you need lots of ice, bring a bag or so.
I will tell you as the second group to stay here we would definitely go back for a quiet weekend. This is not the place for a rowdy group.
And the cookies left for us were incredible! It’s a great place. Just come prepared."

Stayed a few nights","This new airbnb is an absolute gem! A perfect setting on a quiet pond, cattle grazing in the field behind, an open deck for unobstructed stargazing and every amenity considered. It is simultaneously spacious and cozy. The hosts offer hospitality, thoughtfulness, and privacy. It's 5 minutes from Knob Noster State Park for amazing hiking, and the occasional flyovers from Whiteman AFB are a cool bonus! This was a place where I was able to escape, rest, be creative, and feel restored! This will be a regular visit in years to come. Highly recommend!"

Wendy was very communicative and answered all my questions before we arrived and kept us informed about a maintenance issue the housekeepers reported on our arrival date, but it was successfully taken care of before we arrived. As others have said the floor is not level in places. We were there for a week, so it would have been nice to have a dresser or chest of drawers so we could unpack. There were a few loose tiles in the shower."

Stayed a few nights","Stayed at Wendy's place whilst visiting MVC, great location for the college and not too far from a couple of decent places to eat and the town square. Wendy's a great host to communicate with and she responds very quickly; the house had an iron but no ironing board - but she got us a new one within a couple of hours.
V comfy beds and decent sofa on which to sit and watch the TV. Bathroom small, but functional with plenty of hot water for showers (there were 4 of us staying). New fridge in the kitchen and a coffee maker were the only appliances we used.
Yes the floor is uneven between rooms and some of the doors jam where they've been given a fresh coat of paint - but that just gave the place a bit of character.
In summary we enjoyed our stay at Wendy's and would book again if visiting Marshall."

Stayed about a week",House was not ready to be rented out. Renovation were started and ether not completed or done poorly. No blinds on windows appliances not set up properly just sitting wherever they were unloaded. Refrigerator not hooked up to water so no ice. We went and got some ice trays and the refrigerator stopped working. The refrigerator was very old and in need of replacement. Washer and dryer were in good shape but had to use 2 power strips in order to plug the washer in. The floors are different levels in every room. Unit was advertised as 3 bedroom that sleeps 6. One bedroom had only a futon in it no other furniture. There was only one TV in the house and a ROKU remote that did not work the TV only the ROKU unit. Kitchen cabinets doors had so much old paint on them that they would no stay closed. There was very little cold water in the bathroom sink we had to brush our teeth in the kitchen sink. We were in town for death in the family and only slept in the unit or I would have left.

Stayed a few nights","You absolutely need to stay at this property! The beautiful farm house is well cared for and in amazing condition, having an old charm that is so rare to find. The location is so quiet and peaceful with a spectacular view of the night sky (basically 360 degree view and we saw several shooting stars each night without an active meteor shower going on!). It had plenty of space for my group with space left over! There were so many little nooks to spend quiet time that you didn't have to share a space unless you wanted to, and when you did want to share a space with a group you still had several spaces to choose from that fit everyone. There were many outdoor spaces to enjoy a breeze and gorgeous views (my personal favorite was that front porch swing). The hosts were friendly and kind, and incredibly helpful with information. If you're anywhere near this area - this place is a must stay."

Group trip","Our daughter attended and played volleyball for the local college, and we have always stayed at the Comfort Inn. We wanted to use an Airbnb because we had several family members coming for her graduation, and Kashuo's place was the perfect size for our group. Kashuo was a helpful and responsive host, and everything about the house is perfect for a family get together. The kitchen and back porch are perfect places for families to sit and chat, and the house and the trees and land surrounding it were all so beautiful that we were able to take the BEST photos of our daughter in her cap and gown. Our entire stay was wonderful, and the value for the price was unbelievable. I wish we had known about it sooner. If we ever had a reason to be back in Marshall, we would definitely stay here."

We’re foodies and were pleasantly surprised to find an authentic El Salvadoran restaurant in Marshall, the nearest town (thanks to our host’s review in G Maps).
We will definitely come back to stay here when we visit families in the area."

Stayed with kids","What can i say about this place! Beautiful, peaceful, serene. Those words only scratch the surface. The home had so much history to explore in every room. No TV and no internet gave me and my family time to literally unplug. We played board games, chased each other, laughed and loved without a tablet in hands. There are so many things to do in the surrounding areas, so you will never be bored if you chose. The hosts were absolutely top notch. Any question or comment, was responded too immediately. And the only comments I really had were letting them know how beautiful the home and property were. I try felt like I was staying at a family members home and was welcomed as family. Do yourself a favor and stay at this gem in the mid-west. Silent mornings in the kitchen with a cup of coffee, and if you really listened you could hear the laughter and love of the past in that room resonate over you! Hands down amazing, and when i visit family in Missouri, i know where my family will stay!"

Group trip","Lovely historic farmhouse near Arrow Rock and Marshall. The location is great, and it can sleep a lot of people which is wonderful for family gatherings. On the downside, we stayed on a very chilly weekend, and were looking forward to a fire in the living room fireplace, but didn’t realize until we received our pre-stay instructions that the fireplace was bricked up. The historic charm of the house also means it heats very unevenly, with the downstairs bedroom sweltering and the north facing upstairs bedrooms very chilly. Overall, we had a fine stay, but would recommend bringing some extra blankets!"

My family walked in and were immediately at home. Some gathered in the kitchen to cook and laugh, some played games in the big dining room on the large dining table, and some found chairs in parlor rooms and read from any number of history, or arts and sciences books. Some kicked a ball or threw a frisbee outside and everyone had a seat at a table for dinner. The history of the home and the willingness of the family to share it are remarkable. An amazing stay, and we highly recommend it."

The house, which is on the historic register (!!), is quaint, serene and spacious. The land surrounding the farm house is breath taking! You can walk, and walk, and walk, and still be on their land. It’s the perfect escape from the city. Big enough for our family, but likely quite nice for a couple too! Kitchen had everything you need, close enough to town that you can grab decent take-out or groceries. As the listing said, the sunsets were incredible on the front porch. If a baseball field was in the backyard, it would’ve felt like the Field of Dreams."

Others reviewers had said it was a little noisy because it is right off the interstate, and you could hear traffic. You can hear the traffic but to me it was a soothing rymethic sound so for me it was ok. It was not overly loud but you could hear the big rigs tires. We had a great stay, slept well, very clean, and plenty of space so we did not feel crowded. ( 6 of us). I would stay there again if the need arises. Thank you Ben and Sharon"

Truly had a great experience.
The only downside of this stay is the proximity of the home to the interstate. Something the hosts can’t change.
So, if you’re looking for a hotel alternative at a reasonable price, with massive amounts of space, and good amenities this is your spot!
If you’re looking for tranquility this isn’t for you.
Again, can’t rave enough about the hosts and the quality of the home. It were a quarter of a mile further north of south it would easily double the price of each stay AND it would be worth it.
Will stay here again."

The hosts are also very responsive, warm, and helpful. While easy to find and access, the location wasn’t great as this home (which really appears to be a model home once used for sales) literally sits along an interstate highway. Be aware that the sounds of semi trucks and freeway traffic is constant, but there are earplugs provided for those who are not heavy sleepers. Aside from that, the house is decently appointed. If you like to cook your own meals, be advised that there is only one medium chef’s knife and no cutting boards so you may want to bring your own knife roll as well as a bit of supplemental cookware. Overall, this home was adequate for our 2-night stay."

Group trip","My wife and I had driven past Ben and Sharon's Log Cabin Home several times, and always wondered about it and what it looked like inside. Our son was getting married in nearby Odessa, Mo and we started looking around for places to stay. I searched Airbnb's locally, and to our surprise Ben and Sharon's placed popped up and we recognized it right away. After looking at the pictures and reading their description, we looked no further. We initially planned to stay 1 night, and then shortly after decided we'd stay 2 nights. It was perfect for our situation, as we had our other son and his wife along with friends from out of town stay there too. There were 7 of us all total, and we all had more than enough room. Once we were inside the place looked amazing and even better than the photos in their description. The place was A+ and everyone else felt the same way. We told everyone we could about this place along with the owners of the wedding venue. Ben and Sharon were great hosts!!"

Stayed with a pet","We loved staying at this adorable log cabin! It was the perfect option for a weekend wedding with family in town versus a hotel. Ben and Sharon were quick to respond to inquiries, and the house was very clean and organized. Air bed and baby pack and play along with a few kids toys were nice to have for little ones. Highway noise is definitely louder than anticipated but the ear plugs were a wonderful amenity provided. We plan to stay again when we visit family in the area!"

The only draw back is it’s next to a busy highway. They provided earplugs and fans to help the noise. We slept great and didn’t hear the highway noise. We definitely will be staying at their home again.

We didn’t realize how close to the highway it was, and it got to be very noisy during our night stay. They do provide ear plugs which was nice but we wished there was a tv to drown out the noise more. The description said walking distance to restaurants and store. I’d say that’s a stretch. There’s a Mexican restaurant and a McDonald’s within walking distance as well as a dollar general. Not what we were expecting."

Stayed a few nights","House was overall clean & maintained. We did not realize at the time of booking that the house backs directly up to I-70 so there was increased traffic noise. Also, the listing stated that the basement wouldn't be accessible to us as it is used for an office & we may see someone come and go. We were fine with that, however, we assumed it was a small ""home like"" office. Instead it appears that several businesses are being run from there including storage shed & outdoor furniture sales as there were a lot of both on the property. Additionally, the house was a log home and based on the signage at the driveway and the billboard next to the house, it is or was likely a model home for a log home building business. With that all being said, these factors didn't bother us much...just would have been nice to know upfront. It is a neat house. It had ample space. It is easy to find and conveniently located. I think it was priced right for its ""challenges"" and is a good value overall."

I will note that the property is right next to the freeway so if you have a noise sensitivity be sure to bring earplugs for sleeping. The noise was only noticeable when we settled down to sleep. Still a great property and would definitely recommend staying here.

Lots of attention to detail in the house. Lovely beds which is what one needs after a long day in our weaving retreat. Only two things which would have made this space even better would be some comfortable seating so three people could relax and chat about the day and a stove so cooking would be less of a balancing act. There is a hot plate and many other appliance, so much thought has gone into preparing this space. The location was good for us. Beth was out of town but had communicated that clearly and she had her daughter as backup but we didn't need a thing."

We enjoyed the tree swing, tailgate toss, pool table and sitting/having meals lakeside. There was a basketball hoop too. WiFi was speedy and efficient.
The beds were comfortable. I slept soundly. I appreciated the room with two queen beds for my children to use for rest and play.
My children have asked, ""When can we go back?"""

It is a basement so you will hear the owner upstairs but it would not stop us from coming back. She is a great host and replies promptly. It was cold when we were there this time so we just brought the patio furniture in the enclosed porch and still enjoyed the lake view in the mornings with our coffee. She has all the necessities and you cannot find a better view anywhere in Marshall. We have stayed at every B&B in town and we love this one for the serene view. We enjoyed seeing the geese in the pond, the birds in the feeders and the squirrels on the trees. It's a little oasis in the middle of town."

The lake view is just beautiful with areas to sit outside and a small grill available. We visited in January, but the place was cozy and warm with heating units in the different rooms and plenty of warm sheets and blankets. The restaurant suggestions were great and the kitchen area is perfect for heating up small meals or having a cup of coffee. The space is totally private, but Beth was easily reachable too!

It might not be a problem for everyone, but for those of us who it is, walking to the bathroom at night becomes a dangerous risk of slicing your head open against a low-hanging metal ducting and beams. Otherwise it's what you'd expect for a lakehouse. Easy check in & comfy bed."

The inside of the ""rustic"" lake house has comfortable beds with plush pillows. She stocked the bathroom with plenty of towels for our group. We appreciated her information binder that was well stocked with lots of suggestions and brochures. This place beats any hotel in town especially with the wonderful view and we look forward to returning to the lake house."

Stayed one night","We really enjoyed our stay at the lake house Inn. Beth lives in the house above but we let ourselves in via lockbox. we did not interact at all with our host... not that we would have minded! We enjoyed playing pool on the pool table and on a chilly night the wall heaters kept us very warm. We did not utilize the smaller two beds but the large bed was EXTREMELY comfortable and it had the softest most comfortable blanket. Im going to set out to get myself one just like it because we liked it so much. There was a fire pit and wood and although we did not utilize it, it was a nice feature. If there was one drawback, its that the ceilings are low and the bathroom/toilet area is small... not so much a problem for me, but my fiancée at 6’4 looks a bit silly trying to fit in there with his long silly legs. 😂 But if you are not a giant, I cannot see why this wouldn’t be an absolute dream spot for you to visit. You will love falling asleep to crickets and frogs and being greeted in the morning by tweeting birds. Also, if you like meat and cheese you simply MUST visit S&Ps Quality Meats nearby. We bought pineapple habanero sausages and espresso cheddar cheese there, from the owner, who was behind the counter and recommended many unique items and was very friendly. What a truly unique gem of an establishment in an absolute gem of a town. Cannot reccomend this place enough!"

It was pretty hot inside when I got there but the A/C cooled things down great! The water was very hot- previous poster must have been confused about the way the faucet works. Like has it clearly marked now.
The high desk area was very large comfortable and useful.
Finally . I always appreciate it when people can create a super appealing decor with a lot of thrift store finds!"

The listing photos show the exterior at night, which doesn't reveal what the daytime surroundings actually are. But, once we got inside, everything was as shown on the listing photos. Creative, warm, cozy finishes, decently equipped kitchen and bath. The stairs up to the bed are steep, but typical of tiny home features. The bed was a little softer than I like, but my husband was fine with it. All in all, it was a pleasant stay and I would choose to stay there again."

The tiny house is so cozy, the kitchen has everything we needed and the bathroom was spectacular (& a hot shower for my entire shower is such a luxury!) The couches were perfect for meals & relaxation. The bed was nearly more comfortable than our bed at home. The low ceilings in the loft were a small adjustment but not a deal breaker for us. The heating/ac unit was a great touch as it got quite warm on some of the days we stayed. We would 100% drive the 4.5 hours to enjoy this tiny house again.

Stayed a few nights","We really enjoyed our stay at Luke’s place! Everything was as advertised. The kitchen is well-stocked with pots/pans and coffee supplies so we didn’t have much need to go out for supplies, but the market right down the street has almost anything you’d need. Whether you’re just passing through and need a place to stay for the night in the area, or you’re seeking a quiet spot for a quick getaway without distractions, this is a great spot.
2 quick replies to previous reviews:
1) previous comments about comfy bed and steep stairs are still accurate
2) when we stayed in mid-February, the Wi-Fi was working great and all windows had curtains, so we had no concerns about connectivity or privacy."

It isn’t impressive outside but inside is so charming and one of the most comfortable beds I’ve slept in while traveling.
The stairs to the loft are steep so this one isn’t for you if you’re mobility-challenged."

If you’re looking for somewhere to stay past St Louis (going west) or outside of Kansas City (going east), Luke’s place is a perfect spot! Would stay again and will be passing along to family for a recommended pit stop. Thanks Luke!"

Stayed a few nights","The place was wonderful & felt like home. Luke was a responsive host.
My only issues were 1 - no internet/wifi as stated in the description. Luke contacted me at 1 am on the morning of my check-in to inform me there would be no wifi. He offered a refund if I needed to cancel - but there was no time for me to find something else. I had to use my phone's hotspot to use the TV. 2- the stairs leading to the loft were a bit extreme & could easily be halved in height. Those of us with bad knees will find it difficult to climb up & down. For reference, I am 5'6"" and the first step was from the floor to about my knee. 3 - There is no privacy in the back area of the house There is a large window which looks out onto the back yard & the neighbors house & side porch. I travel alone & it made me feel uneasy at night. 4 - this one is out of control for Luke, but should be noted, there is a large dog that barks all night - not during the day - just at night. Made sleeping rough on such a comfy bed."

Notified day of check in that the roof had storm damage but the tarp had clearly been in place a while. You need to bend over in the loft to get to the bed or plug anything in. Steps to get upstairs were a workout."

The decor was also lovely. Luke was extremely responsive when we messaged and was accommodating to our request for a slightly early check in. The area the tiny home is in feels very peaceful. The stairs to the loft are steep, but once you’re up there, the bed is like a cloud. It can sometimes be difficult to sleep in a bed that is not your own, but we both slept very well. Whether you’re a weary traveler just passing through or looking for a quiet weekend (or longer) getaway, this place is for you."

It is more beautiful than the pictures and just a little slice of heaven. Ever item in the home was so thoughtfully chosen and beautiful. I wish we would have stayed longer to enjoy the space. The bed was SO comfortable and the whole place felt like home. It is a little tricky to get into the loft bed and would be hard for an older person but it was fine for us and definitely worth it. I'd recommend this place to anyone in the area!

Stayed one night","What an adorable place to stay. We were looking for a quiet, private place just for an overnight and this spot was wonderful. The home was perfect for my husband and I. The home was clean and in order. Everything was neat and tidy. Luke provided wonderfully detailed instructions on the home, including operation of things such as the heat/air unit. The bed and linens were cozy. The kitchen was well furnished - though we didn’t need to use it.
My only complaint, though it was easy to move past - was the lack of WiFi. The listing indicates there is WiFi, however the instructions that came with the check in indicated it wouldn’t be installed til next week. Neither my husband nor I had very good cellular signal so we couldn’t use our personal phones for a hotspot either. We just used the time to unplug together but I would suggest confirming WiFi prior to booking if this is important to you. The TV will not work without internet.
However, we loved our stay and do recommend this spot!"

Stayed a few nights","This is the perfect place to stay if your looking for a nice, relaxing, and peaceful place. It’s like a home away from home. For the most part it’s quiet and calm. The only thing you’ll hear is trains that drive by but that’s not often. It’s a very beautiful home and I recommend this to anyone. Roger is also a very nice and friendly guy. He checked up on us and made sure we were alright while we were there. If anyone’s looking for a place to stay in Carrollton this is definitely the place to stay."

Stayed with kids","I wish I could give this home 10 stars. we were in town for a funeral and finding a place that housed the family wasn't easy. Roger was great, the home was cozy, quiet, and peaceful. I never sleep well in other places but I was OUT every night. whenever I come back to Carrollton I plan on booking this amazing farmhouse"

Group trip","Our family of 7 was needing a place to stay for a family wedding being held nearby. This little farmhouse was just perfect for what we were looking for! The house was very clean and had the cutest decor for a little farmhouse charm! Roger was very accommodating when we asked for an earlier check-in and he also offered a very flexible check-out time, which was both very much appreciated! If we ever happen to be back in the area, we wouldn’t hesitate to book this house again!"

Stayed with a pet",Roger's place is very nice and cozy and has been completely remodeled. The farm is very quiet and private and the beds are super comfortable. We definitely recommend Roger's place.
