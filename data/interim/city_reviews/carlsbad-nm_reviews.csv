Stayed one night","The casita was in a great location, right on the river if we wanted to watch the water traffic, and off main street enough to not hear much vehicle traffic (noise). Sat in the back porch swing and did nothing. Would stay again."

Stayed with a pet","We really enjoyed staying at this house. We walked down from the back porch straight to the river dock and sat foe hours. The location is great and lots of restaurants near by. We had dinner at Panchos, it was amazing. Definitely recommend! Wish we had more time to rent kayaks or a small boat to cruise the river. Will definitely be back!"

Stayed a few nights","it's a great little Casita to stay in and enjoy the nice views from lake carlsbad. There's a train that passes through but me and my fiance enjoy the sound. the train sound is honestly nit that noticeable in my opinion as to what other reviewers were mentioning. Jenn so graciously left a breakfast voucher which was super nice especially since we were already planning to visit the blue house bakery. The entire Airbnb was very nice and the location was great for our trip needs. The only thing that wasn't good was probably that a blanket on the bed didn't smell the best, but other than that everything was perfect. would definitely stay again!"

Stayed one night","Nice, spacious place for my husband and I to unwind a bit after living the motel life for almost two weeks. The patio and deck out back were great (especially if you’re a birder, which we aren’t, but there was definitely a ton of bird activity!) and very nicely maintained.
It is close to a busy street and train track, so if you’re looking for absolute peace and quiet, it’s not always 100%—but, we’re from the city, so a little bit of street noise here and there doesn’t bother us, especially when you get to sit underneath the night sky and pick out new constellations.
And just for anyone with mobility concerns when it comes to showering, the floor is a bit slippery and slanted (obviously, to drain) and there isn’t really anything to hold on to. There is a grab bar, but it’s outside of the shower on the wall opposite to the faucet.
And to be sure, these aren’t complaints or criticisms, just observations for future guests!
Great place and hosts and I definitely would stay here again!"

We loved drinking coffee out back on a swinging bench and listening to the birds. We left the next day for the caverns which is not too far away but could’ve stayed a few more days!

Stayed with a pet","This casita #2 was so perfect to stay the weekend at if you are looking to fish, be outdoors, cook outside, and hangout. We didn’t have to leave the casita all weekend it was in such a perfect part of town right by the river and all the local river areas and activities. Walking to the park across the railroad tracks at night was so fun! We’ll definitely rent out this air b and b when we return to Carlsbad. Inside was so clean and new. The inside was modern and clean. The dock out by the river was the nicest dock we could see in the area. Big fish in the water, we could see them swimming right by the dock. Can’t wait to go back!"

Stayed a few nights","I stay in a lot of airbnbs and have high cleanliness and maintenance standards.
This airbnb was ok.
Very small space, low ceilings. Bedroom light was 3 feet over the bed.
Noisy neighbourhood. Trucks with no mufflers driving around in the night. You are not only ""likely"" to hear the train during your stay, you will be hearing it behind your wall all day starting at 6-7am and ending after 11pm.
Tile in the bathroom is cracking and falling off the wall.
Shower stall floor and corners are really moldy. Windows are dirty and have spiderwebs.
Window blinds have broken pieces.
Dusty AC vents.
Couch is broken in the middle.
Grill outside was nasty and never been cleaned.
Piles of leaves on the porch.
Didn't feel comfortable or relaxed there."

Stayed a few nights","We had a nice stay in Jen’s house. The breakfast gift certificate and the coffee in the house were appreciated. The place heated up quickly, which was nice, but the air conditioning unit in the window made the bedroom drafty. The unit was reasonably clean, but there were some spots, like drawers in the bedroom, or windows, that needed a little more attention. If you want to cook, bring your spices and condiments, we found pepper, sugar, and oil. The small issue we ran into, is that the checkin instructions are not provided until almost the time of checkin. We received them 23 minutes before checkin—we were already in the area and did not have good cell service. We ended up driving around looking for signal, so we could open the message. It was a packed multi-destination trip, planned to the smallest detail and 30-min. time increment itinerary, so this did not provide for a stress-free travel experience."

Jenn's home was clean, quiet, cozy and we cooked our meals in her kitchen. On top of it all, Jenn gave us a complimentary breakfast at a local eatery with fantastic food. So generous! Thanks Jenn"

I look for places that are hosted by her first because I know that I won’t have to do all the cleaning on top of paying a cleaning fee. Book with Jenn. You won’t regret it. Also, try the Blue House Bakery and Cafe. It is a little gem of a place and it gets busy so get there early."

Stayed a few nights","Enjoyed our stay in this spacious little hacienda! It reminded me of my grandparents' house--it's older, but that makes it charming. The bed was comfy, the location was great, and there was a big back yard and back porch. There is a train bridge over the river--very close to the house. I like trains, so watching the train crossing the bridge over the foggy river in the morning sunlight was very cool. We did not hear the train at night. We enjoyed a great breakfast in the outdoor seating area at the Blue House Bakery & Cafe with a voucher provided by the property owners. We also had this amazing concoction of tiny donuts, soft-serve ice cream, butterscotch syrup, and a mixture of cinnamon and sugar, topped with whipped cream at SIPS Sodas & Snacks, which is less than a mile down the road. GPS places this house's address at the townhouse complex next door. This was a great place to stay after camping at Guadalupe Mountains NP, then visiting Carlsbad Caverns NP!"

Stayed one night","I can’t put into words how peaceful this place is. It is surprisingly charming. I loved so many of the little things from the old doors to the little surprise in the backyard. It is updated but not complete modern. I loved the tiny kitchen, the cabinets were my favorite part. It had everything we needed for an overnight stay. Including a Brita water pitcher. Jenn was very detailed in her initial emails and we didn’t have to contact her during our stay. I messaged her early the next morning to let her know we were checked out early and she responded very quickly. Seriously, if they ever decide to add a hot tub to this amazing little place they will not be able to get rid of me. I will be booking all the time. As it is, I hope I get the opportunity to book again and stay longer. The fish in that river are calling my name."

Stayed a few nights","Wonderful property! Lakeside casita in the Chihuahuan desert, pretty amazing. Even better, the hosts are hospitality experts. The casita is beautifully decorated and had everything we needed for a very pleasant stay. Fishing off the dock and taking a run or walk on the nearby lakeside paved path were especially memorable. Loved the casita patio to watch the boats run up & down the lake. Well cooled in hot weather. Very comfortable bedding and towels. Very clean. Spend more than 1 night to explore Carlsbad and the caverns.
Pro dining tips:
Eat a breakfast at the Blue House Cafe
Eat a dinner at the Carniceria San Juan De Los Lagos
You'll walk away from both with a smile and a great meal."

Stayed a few nights","Riverside House #2 is a gem on the banks of the Pecos river. We brought 2 cars to one of the largest car shows in NM. Jenn was prompt in assuring us the property had enough parking for our cars & the neighborhood was safe. Both were true. Jenn was very helpful after I left my phone in the house & couldn't remember the lock code. Jenn promptly called my wife with the code and all was well.
Check in/out was a breeze; all we needed to do was wash dishes & pick up any mess we made. Clear instructions were provided & the property is easy to find. Grocery stores & restaurants a reasonable distance away. We agree with those who described the property as ""rustic"" but don't let this discourage you. The property is very clean with all the right amenities. Plenty of hot water & fluffy towels. Comfy bed. Just right for 1 or 2 per.; short/medium stays. Relaxing on the back porch while watching the river was great. Train noise at times but not after about 9pm. Mostly quiet neighborhood. Great stay!"

Backyard was a dream being right on the Pecos river and was very peaceful at the end of a day of hiking at Carlsbad Cavern. There are no places to stay near the Cavern (like many National parks) so you have to stay in Carlsbad. The city was way more than I expected and Jenns breakfast recommendation for Blue Bakery was spot on. Amazing service and food. We ate at Lucy’s Mexican restaurant about 4 minutes away and what a little gem that was. Perfect stay, perfect host, and perfect accommodation. Thanks Jenn!!!"

Stayed a few nights","Wonderful place! We will be back. Place was very clean and the location on the Pecos river was fantastic. We spent a lot of time on the back patio watching folks boating, kayaking and jet skiing along the river. We also enjoyed watching a good variety of birds and water fowl. The vibe is “family cabin” and the place is a bit rustic but it was clean and comfortable. The bed was super comfortable and the kitchen had all the basics although we did not cook while there. We also received a voucher for a wonderful breakfast at the Blue House Bakery which is owned by the owners of the property. There is city noise and you can hear the train but by around 9-10 PM it is quiet and we had no issues sleeping."

Stayed a few nights","Great manager of the property. Owner has a great location and hires the best to insure the place is clean and equipped with excellent amenities. Great parking, private, easy access to the river and has a great view of the river from the back porch. Instructions were clear. Manager did not expect us to do all the cleaning work before we left, simply asked that we wash any dishes we used. At others we have paid an extravagant fee for cleaning and then were required to clean the place, start laundry, take trash to the dumpster and even move the dumpster to the curb. No such thing here. On top of the good service and clean facility, we received a coupon for a free breakfast on each morning we were there at one of the best restaurants in Carlsbad (The Blue House). Also, the location is very quite, with little if any, street noise. All linens were like new and the towels were thick, not ""blue light specials"" as some use."

Stayed a few nights","Jenn was awesome with communicating- great response time, and was able to get us a booking for the night - we were there in 20 minutes! That’s great service! We also immediately added a 2nd night- which Jenn also quickly managed. The pictures are accurate, but fail to show the aging. It was clean, except for the windows, which were dirty, cobwebbed and cracked. The door locks need work- front door bolt doesn’t catch. Years ago, I’m sure it was a stunning tiny home. Also, for a couples retreat, the man cave two seater couch with cup holders in between the seats needs to go. A couch with a coffee table would be more ideal. The bed was very neat and clean and comfortable, and the shower was roomy and had ample hot water and great water pressure! It was a welcomed break from camping/hiking in the Lincoln National Forest, and Jenn did a fantastic job handling our booking."

The unit was clean and comfortable, and Jared provided lots of ""extras"" like coffee pods for the Keurig and shampoo/conditioner/body wash. The bath towels were nice and fluffy, too! We didn't use the kitchen so can't speak to that, but it appeared to be well stocked. The alley from which we accessed the parking was a bit run down, but otherwise the neighborhood seemed nice and safe. Access to Carlsbad Caverns was quick (about 25 minute drive) and easy, as was access to a laundromat, car wash, gas station, etc. We also found a decent barbecue place that is very nearby. Overall, we were very satisfied with our stay and recommend Jared's place."

The outdoor grill was perfect for steaks and had plenty of propane. Has a kereg coffee maker. I used that religiously. I left a 48 count dunkin doughnuts k cup box for the next occupants to enjoy.
If you forget any bathing items he has you covered. There were many various soaps, body washes, shampoos and conditioners available.

Stayed a few nights","This is a cozy spot to stay in the city of Carlsbad. It's close to a lot of places in town, including a park along the Pecos River, and it's about a 40-minute drive from here to Carlsbad Cavern. The bed is comfy, the AC worked well, there's a nice shower, and the TV had access to Amazon Prime and Netflix. The area was very quiet while I was there (four nights). You have to park in a small spot off an alley, so I was thankful (again) for my little car. If you're looking for an inexpensive place to stay in this area, I would recommend this spot."

The separate space and entrance was great because we have a four yr old whole likes to be quite loud and we didn't have to worry that we were bothering other people the whole time. The beds were cozy, has a small kitchen we were able to make our own food in, and a little patio to sit outside on."

We arrived on a very hot day and found that the ventilation/cooling was a bit underpowered for the large space and couldn’t get the temp below 80° until late at night. Overall it was okay but probably would be better value for more than 3 people.

The bad: Kitchen trash can was left full from previous guests. The furnishings
were very inexpensive but in good shape. The bed was uncomfortable and pretty hard to sleep on. Matress should be replaced with a much softer one. No direct contact with the host even just to make sure we had everything we needed. All communication was through text message. Very tight parking off of the back alley. The host started watering his lawn and sprayed water over the fence with the automatic sprinkler at the front door causing us to have to make a mad dash to get in the door without getting wet. Lots of room for improvement."

Great water pressure, our own water heater, big shower head, big shower/tub, very clean. Every hiker’s dream. Will definitely stay again if we’re ever brave/crazy enough to climb Guadalupe again."

The kitchen has plenty of supplies if you were wanting to cook, the bed was super comfortable, and the air conditioning a well-needed amenity in the New Mexican heat!

We are early morning hikers so the coffee pod provided definitely helped since we leave before most coffee places open. Visit the Blue House Bakery for coffee/breakfast if you visit btw - so yummy!
We appreciated the privacy of the house - better than being a hotel with all the noise from other rooms.
Thanks Jared!"

It took us about an hour to get to Guadalupe Mountains and 30-45 minutes to Carlsbad caverns. The bed was super comfy and we were able to log into the WiFi with ease. The back alley entrance was a nice touch. We also spotted some cute little squirrels running around in the trees and telephone poles. You can’t beat this price. Thank you for hosting us!

Stayed one night","There were a series of preventable issues that the host did not deem appropriate for a discount in fees. I reached out early in my stay because there was a terrible smell in the bathroom, they said it could be the washer. I was only there for a night, so I said they could resolve it after I left. The AC was set too low by the housekeeper and it froze, ejecting ice from the vent onto the floor at midnight, waking me from my sleep. I did a load of wash and after 4 cycles it still wasn't dry! There was also a slime needing cleaning in the kettle, which I did. When I asked for a discount, they didn’t think it was reasonable to: I should have let them know about the kettle so they could address it (at an hour before checkout), they could have taught me how to use their dryer, at 9:45 pm and they said, basically, when you travel things go wrong. No apologies or responsibility. It was a gorgeous listing but I didn’t appreciate the request of a 5 star review after my experience. It felt lousy"

Stayed a few nights","Lovely little place for a weekend stay, very easy to get to Carlsbad Caverns from the house. Kitchen amenities including a countertop oven made cooking a breeze when we didn't want to to go out. The in-unit laundry is also a huge bonus for longer stays or traveling light.
If accessibility is a concern there are quirks to consider when staying in this tiny house including a tight toilet area, a low bed, and a reach through gate that requires a bit of dexterity due to lack of direct visualization of the latch.
As mentioned by other reviews, if you have a sensitive nose, the smell from the shower drain could impact your stay. Packing an air freshener couldn't hurt.
While the space felt curated and the fixtures were nice, there were a couple housekeeping misses including lack of regular pillow cases or spare linens, and a dirty keurig machine.
Overall, worth the price for the amenities."

After talking to Airbnb, and at their direction, I contacted Natalie to let her know of the situation. I never actually heard from Natalie besides the auto messages scheduled to be sent - even after letting her know about our schedule change. We are hosts as well and while we weren’t expecting a refund (though Airbnb told us they would request one anyway), it was a little weird to not hear anything from Natalie at all. About two days after our trip, Natalie left us a review even though we never ended up staying with her, which also made me uncomfortable. We were super excited for this stay and have no doubt it is a great find, we just wish the communication had been a little better."

Stayed a few nights","The unit is beyond adorable and about 98% of the pictures paint an accurate picture of the conditions. Natalie and the property manager were very informative and left us with no questions upon arrival. While we did not feel the rating should be decreased below 5 stars, my travel partner and I would like to give future travelers a heads up on two things we were disappointed by. The shower-head is much smaller than the one pictured, which would not be an issue except for the rolling temperatures of the water. The water would adjust from lukewarm, to cold and then extremely hot. If the shower-head wasn't so small, we might have been able to optimize the warm moments and avoid the discomfort. The other disappointment we experienced was the amount of hair left in the shower drain, bedroom floor and in the bed. After a 7.5 hour drive, we weren't in a place to request a fresh clean. Overall, we swept away the hair and had an AMAZING time with the fire pit and cozy energy. Great find!"

Everything is just as pictured, decorated so wonderfully and well appointed. The Vinyl Record player was a fun surprise. It was raining on our visit so we didn’t get to enjoy the patio but it looked super inviting. We had a small issue with the water heater not staying hot when we showered but overall our stay was excellent. Would definitely stay again."

Excellent communication from both Natalie and her property manager - I would get responses within minutes of sending a message. Very convenient location for visiting national parks -- we were ~30 min away from Carlsbad Caverns and ~50 min away from Guadalupe Mountains. Natalie also had an excellent guide book with recommendations for local restaurants. We would absolutely come back and stay again!

Perfect for a one night stop over for visiting the caverns, otherwise not much to do in Carlsbad. The neighborhood felt a bit neglected; we did not want to go for a walk or leave the Airbnb. However we had no issues. As noted by many guests, the smell from the drain after running the shower was really strong; and the temperature of the water was inconsistent."

Stayed a few nights","I've stayed in shipping containers before, but this one was my favorite. Despite the small space of shopping containers, this one did not feel cramped at all. The layout was perfect, and they even had a washer and dryer, which was a must for me. Th decor was amazing as well. I bought groceries to cook breakfast and make myself lunch, and there was no cooking oil. Katherine seriously drove all the way to me to give me a bottle. To go above and beyond like that was so nice, I was very grateful. The record player was also such a nice touch, I loved pairing up my phone and listening to music in the morning and while cooking. The book with recommendations was so cute as well. I chose to stay in because this trip was mostly gor hiking and I was exhausted at the end of every day so I didn't feel like going out. But the fact that they provided that was such a nice touch. Now this is a small space just FYI, no more than 2 people, but it was perfect for me. Thank you so much for everything! ❤️"

Stayed one night","We felt lucky to find Natalie's place after deciding to drive down to Carlsbad from Santa Fe with short notice. I was truly impressed with how she made this shipping container feel so cozy and truly like a home - it's seriously decked out better than our apartment in NYC! I also got a lot of ideas about how to decorate a small space so efficiently. Nothing in this home feels small - everything is normal-sized, and once you're inside, it's incredible how you lack for nothing, but what I really loved was the enclosed patio. It's private and fenced, so I stayed out here in front of the fire pit watching the stars which is a lovely way to relax after a day at the caverns. It's also close enough that you can go for the evening or morning bat flights, so that was a plus. It's a great spot to access local businesses as well. We loved eating at Tina's Mexican Kitchen and visiting La Tienda Thriftway to get some choice Mexican treats! Overall, a short, albeit excellent stay!"

It obviously is a small space but there is definitely enough room for 2 people, especially if you are in the area to get outside to the National Parks like we were. The home looked great and had everything you would need for a weekend away. We had the record player on constantly! I also loved the local recommendations. The first night we tried to get a fire started but were out of propane but when I messaged Chip and Natalie and they answered immediately and were over in about 10 minutes to help out! Unfortunately, it was too windy to get it to light so we did not get to use the fireplace but it was a great outdoor space! The only drawback to our stay would be that the water in the shower was not very warm (which I asked the hosts about and they mentioned they were actively working to fix it, so this may no longer be the case). If you are visiting in the warmer months this likely won't be an issue for you anyway. Overall I would definitely recommend!"

Natalie told me it was because of the home being new, which is fair. It did prevent us from showering which was a bummer after a long day of driving but overall our stay was good. Everything else was as expected and communication was good."

It was a great jumping off point to go see the Caverns, White Sands, & Roswell and had restaurants 5-10 min away. Gas station is right around the corner, and we found the welcome/info binder very helpful. Only suggestion is to stock more coffee, but we’re from Washington so take that with a grain of salt haha.

Highly recommend. And we’ll definitely be returning at some point in the future. It was our very first experience with an Airbnb. And we couldn’t have been more happy with this property."

This is a great location to base yourself if you want to explore the Pecos River or the Carlsbad Caverns (which I highly recommend). I will definitely stay here again when I next visit the area.

There were simple intentional amenities that were a nice surprise, such as the power stations for plus/usb on either side of the beds, nice bedside lamps in addition to the overhead lamps/fans, great removable shower heads with good water pressure, large quality shampoo/conditioner/soap, plenty of clean, fresh bathroom linens, coffee pot and Keurig, plenty of kitchen utensils, coffee mugs, plates/cups, etc. The house was very spacious, and well-lit, enabling us to have a wonderful Thanksgiving in the home.

The house is big and has been fabulously remodeled with an abundance of small touches - for example, the light switches and charging ports are strategically placed so they are easy to find. The kitchen is state-of-the-art. The neighborhood is very quiet - except for a train coming through semi-late one morning, but it was charming. Noisy neighbors is always my main worry - 'Not a problem at Jacoda's."

There are a lot of oil and gas trucks in town, and you could hear some traffic noise from those in the early mornings. Quiet at night.

We enjoyed the sauna and the thoughtful amenities that she provided. We really enjoyed the personal touch of the dedication of her home to her mom (aka Margo).

She communicated with us throughout the process and has lots of sweet mementos in her home discussing why she even built the “casita”. The sauna was an added bonus and we enjoyed trying it out. She left candy out, hot chocolate and supplied coffee and water which we appreciated. It was a perfect place to lay our heads for a night after we explored the wildlife and town. Her dog, Tess was very cute too for my kids to pet upon arrival.

She let us have access to her patio which had a nice outdoor seating area as well as a grill! The sauna was amazing, the bedroom had a window AC unit so the bedroom was cool despite the heat from the sauna. Tess was our favorite part and why we chose this Airbnb! She was such a sweet dog! She really only came to us if we called her over for pets so if you are worried she would bother you, don’t be!

The space has everything you need and a wonderful story on how it came to be. Nice plus is the private sauna in the colder temps.

We enjoyed blue house bakery & cafe for coffee and breakfast. PJ & B’s rio café had the best breakfast burritos! The front door is actually on the back of the building from where you park, Probably since most of their business comes from the pedestrians walking along the river walk. The is was the most relaxing place we stayed on our vacation and, Tess was such a sweetie! Always there to welcome us! We would definitely love to come back to this area again!"

Great kitchen. The full size fridge and separate freezer were perfectly suited for our stay - since we prepared all of our meals on site. There is a wonderful grocery store about 4 blocks away. The living room couch is not comfortable, but it did not detract from our overall enjoyment of the place. Excellent communication from host. Would absolutely recommend!"

We love it and the easy check out instructions are major bonus for me. Jenn is such an amazing host. If we can’t book this place, we try to book another place that is hosted by Jenn and Elizabeth. We have never had an issue and we look forward to staying in any of their properties but this one is our favorite, by far. You cannot go wrong when booking any of the properties that Jenn and Elizabeth host. They take pride in the properties that they host and it shows."

The only downside we noticed was that you couldn’t take longer than 10 minute showers or the water would turn pretty cold. Also, if you get hot at night just be sure to bring a fan for the bedroom.
Other than that it was extremely beautiful and so clean! The fireplace in the bedroom was a super cute light at night and you can either use the fireplace for heat or just the light.
Communication was easy and the host is very responsive so that’s awesome! Detailed instructions for the stay are sent beforehand and they’re very helpful!"

The town Carlsbad doesn’t really have much to do, and the restaurants were just bleh, so we popped over to the Albertsons and bought ingredients to make a gourmet meal in the big beautiful gourmet kitchen, and that really made for a wonderful time. If you’re wondering if you should stay here, the answer is yes!! I bet it’s the nicest place in Carlsbad."

The space is absolutely gorgeous and relaxing, this was truly an oasis to come home too.

I’ve stayed in a lot of places and this one was the most unique.

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I loved staying here. The kitchen was huge with lots of counter-top space and a giant refrigerator, and if we had been planning on cooking it would have more than met our needs.
The bed was extremely comfortable, so much that whatever mattress they have THAT is the one I'd like to upgrade our own home to!
What really sets this home apart is the location and decor. Built into an old church sanctuary, and decorated with genuine Indian decor, it's one-of-a-kind. A lot of the hardware (doors, entryways, etc.) seems to be from the original church - which makes it a bit unusual but I really liked the authentic feel of it. The bathtub and shower are both very nice. We really enjoyed our stay!"

The only down side was the door would lock when we were trying to leave the place. It took 15 min at least to get the door to completely lock. The other thing is there isn’t a actual couch there’s a love seat and chairs that are very hard and straight backed. After our long day of hiking/sightseeing in the sun it would have been amazing to be able to lounge and watch tv.

Stayed a few nights","The house itself is charming, and there is clearly a lot of money and effort spent on the furniture and decorations. However, the good things about the house end at that. First major problem is the location.. it’s in an isolated part of town, right across the street from the adult detention center. It’s pretty loud too with all the cars passing by.
Secondly, the furniture in the living room was uncomfortable and odd. The couch would really only fit one person, if two people were to sit it’s pretty uncomfortable. There were too many random useless chairs and tables when they could’ve just had a couple of nice couches.
Lastly, I had so much trouble just unlocking the front door. The lockbox did not work well for me at all and caused frustration every single time, as I would try to get inside while standing in the freezing cold. The keypad/lock kept getting stuck and the front door wouldn’t open until the 7th or 8th try."

Stayed a few nights","Absolutely idyllic church-cottage :) I was a little worried about some of the reviews (keep reading), but my husband and loved our stay here - every need was anticipated (e.g., wine bottle opener, hand soap and lotion bc it’s soo dry here, makeup towels, even dental kits in case you forgot yours!). Some of the reviews freaked me out saying there is no bathroom door. Nah - there’s a perfectly normal bathroom with a normal door. There’s also a larger bath/shower/tub room that has a pretty barn door if you feel the need to close something, and there’s a shutter-like door to the water closet. It’s all beautiful, luxurious, and totally fine - don’t worry. We stayed here to hike Guadalupe and visit the Caverns and it was perfect. Thank you!"

Stayed a few nights","Overall a great experience!
To start, although the location is in a strange area, it was still easy to find, within walking distance to restaurants and grocery stores.
Once inside, the house itself is gorgeous. Very eclectic and nothing like anything I have ever seen, which made the experience more exciting. My only wish was that there was a bigger couch for lounging and laying down on.
For the bedroom, it was open concept with the bathroom, so there is little privacy (which may be uncomfortable for some, and luckily there is a separate bathroom adjacent to the bedroom that has a door and lock if needed). The bed is firm, but comfortable. The bathroom is spacious, providing a huge standing shower and a big bathtub.
We enjoyed our stay a lot, and it was fun exploring the town and National park nearby!"

- [Pros] the listing is pretty roomy with a very large living room and kitchen; The home decoration is very special and stylish; I like the kitchen and it has everything you need; The bed is comfortable
- [Cons] The shower/bathroom doesn't have a curtain or door, it feels weird; The neighborhood has nothing unsafe for us, but the houses around us were mostly have ""for closure"" signs and it feels a bit sketchy at night"

Stayed a few nights","The space was beautiful & very well done. Love the furnishings & little touches. Plenty of room & seating for our families to gather, & a well-stocked chef’s kitchen. Very romantic for the 2 of us when we weren’t with the rest of the family. Had a wonderful time cooking & playing games on our Thanksgiving holiday. Only downside is it’s not very well-lit throughout, & feels dark when cooking & sitting at the table for dining & games, & getting ready. A few of the decorative lamp bulbs were burned out which might have helped a bit, but it really needs more overhead lighting, or a floor lamp. This was our only complaint really~could use some hooks in the foyer for coats/hanging clothes; the bar in the armoire isn’t usable due to a shelf. We tightened 2 of the door locks that were loose, as the front door was “catchy” & a kitchen breaker popped the last night but host was very responsive. Beautiful former church with what seemed to be original doorframes that we loved ~ very unique!"

Although the outside isn’t outstanding, once you walk through the front door you realize the care and thought that was put into creating a welcoming and memorable environment for guests to enjoy. It’s a very roomy space with a great kitchen, a bar area and beautiful granite counter tops. The decorations throughout the house represent different cultures and provide points of interest in every direction. The walk in shower was nice and the claw foot bathtub was much needed after a long day of hiking. The bed was big and comfortable. We took pictures of the interior to show our friends. Great place!"

Stayed one night",The house was interesting. It has lots of very stylistic details but the style was prioritized over function. There isn't a full sized couch or anywhere comfortable to lounge. It is relatively dark and enclosed with limited doors or privacy if you are staying with another person. The location was good and felt safe but it's near the train tracks/industrial area with limited to no outdoor space. Other than that the kitchen was great. The master bedroom was cool but the bathroom in the master has no doors to the toilet or to the bedroom. But all in all it was good for a nights stay.

The pictures are accurate (except there is an extra sofa in the living area) and only give a glimpse of the luxuriousness, it feels even more so in person! Elizabeth definitely has a flair for decorating and comfort. It was sparkling clean, spacious, comfortable and the central heat worked well. The TV is first rate (65”, and very sharp, with netflix and others available). Check in/out was extremely easy and parking was right in front of the door. The apartment is on somewhat of a main thoroughfare, but with double-paned windows and the bedroom in the back, traffic noise did not bother us. Jenn was very communicative, warm and friendly. We would highly recommend this place."

Stayed a few nights","""Sanctuary"" the perfect name for this little home away from home. My husband and I just spent Thanksgiving Weekend there. We were able to cook our own little Thanksgiving feast in the chef's kitchen. The bed was really comfortable, the hospitality was on point. The architectural design in this old church is really spectacular, they did an amazing job with the lighting, incorporating the very old pieces of history and thinking of thing after thing that just keeps catching your eye. The bath was so relaxing, the fireplace in the bedroom was so soothing to lay there and read after a long bath.
We visited the Carlsbad Caverns one day and the ""Christmas on the Pecos"" was a definite must see. Take a blanket (thanks Jenn) and dress warm. I've already recommended to a few of my friends. Thanks Again for such a relaxing weekend."

Jenn's house was just perfect for us, with plenty of space to spread out. We enjoyed passing by peaceful evenings on the porch, enjoying a beer. We also cooked all four of our dinners in the well-stocked kitchen which was a really nice bonus. We appreciated the in-refrigerator filtered water and the Keurig coffee pods and other coffee choices that were available for us in the house. The wifi was also very strong, helping us to plan our hikes each day. We would not hesitate to recommend Casa de Roitan for other explorers!"

Stayed a few nights","Pleasant stay at the Casa. The house is a really neat old home, which I enjoyed. Walking distance to some downtown restaurants and brew pub, and provided a good spot for driving to the Cavern and Guadalupe NP. The house looked a bit better in the photos, so don’t expect the same “staging” look, but it’s quite roomy & clean, with some neat southwest touches. I was disappointed to find out the fireplace is only decorative and the bed in the master, while comfortable overall, the mattress was slightly sloped. The coffee bar was great and the host left us some Easter candy! Appreciated that all we had to do before checkout was run the dishwasher and empty the bathroom trash into the large kitchen trash. Jenn was extremely quick to respond to messages/questions."

The only minor issue we had was that none of the windows in the house can open. Luckily the heat and A/C worked well, but it was a little annoying to not be able to get fresh air in the house without needing to open the front and back doors. Otherwise everything was great though!"

Easy drive of 40 mins. to Carlsbad caverns. The master bath was not as clean as desired while we were there for 1 night. Host is very sweet and went out of her way to make sure all our requests were met. I recommend this home for easy access to most site seeing things in Carlsbad.

We ate in for all meals. grocery store is just a short walk. Good selection at the store. Jenn and Elizabeth were quick to respond as well as when an issue arose. We had 4 adults in our group, used all the bedrooms, all were comfortable. We enjoyed the unique floorplan and squirrels outside. Great hot water. We used this as a midpoint for sight-seeing for several days. Plenty of towels, kitchen towels, extra throws, blankets for chiller weather. Heater works, however, our group prefers chilly temps for sleeping. would definitely recommend Jenn and Elizabeth's place."

Stayed a few nights","We stayed for 3 nights to explore the Carlsbad Caverns which are definitely worth seeing. It's clearly an old property but they did a nice job renovating it. The nicely restored original wooden floor is a highlight.
A large supermarket (Albertsons) is within walking distance.
Just two things that we think need improvement:
- The lighting throughout the property. All the dim light bulbs should be replaced with at least double as strong ones. We found it straining on the eye to not be able to fully turn on the lights.
- The smell. The building has a very strong odor (probably from the old wooden structures or moisture?) which is mixing with even stronger artificial scents that we think make things just worse."

Stayed with kids","This was a very nice and spacious place to stay and was very close to great food and coffee. The house was very well appointed, and Jenn took efforts to include special touches: jazz music playing upon our arrival, toothbrushes, and coffee. Jenn’s communication was excellent, and check-in and check-out were easy.
The only possible drawback for families may be the location. This very cute house is the only residential house in the area, and is surrounded by houses used for commercial purposes. The central location would be perfect for travelers without children, but we were a little uneasy letting the kids out of our sight in this non-residential neighborhood. Otherwise, there are several benefits to the location, which is walking distance to great restaurants and cafes.
This was a clean, comfortable, cute and welcoming place to stay in Carlsbad. I highly recommend it, as long as you are comfortable in a mostly commercial area."
