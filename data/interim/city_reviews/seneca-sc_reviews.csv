Stayed a few nights",We can’t say enough about our experience! Theresa was an incredible host. This was our first official large family trip and she made it possible for us! She even went above and beyond and borrowed a high chair for us for the little ones. All the snacks and treats were so appreciated! And the best part is how responsive she was! We can’t wait to come back again!

Stayed a few nights","We had a great stay and would absolutely return. Communication was excellent. The house has so much to offer and is exactly as described. Close to Clemson for any campus happenings and a great place to return to after time on campus or exploring the area with plenty of water toys to enjoy on the lake! Also very convenient to grocery, gas, etc.
Great hosts and a great home."

Group trip",Our Airbnb experience in this house was amazing and every aspect exceeded our expectations. The house was about a 10 min drive from Clemson which was great for our weekend plans. The attention to detail in the house was impressive from the communication to the cleanliness of the house. You could definitely tell that great pride is taken in maintaining a spotless space and the well -stocked kitchen was great. From the moment we booked the host answered all of our questions!! We have definitely added this house to our list for future stays and plan to be back for another visit soon!

Group trip","Our time at the Tee house exceeded expectations! The house was spotless and had lots of fun surprises from treats in the kitchen, games and everything you needed for fun in the lake (canoe, paddle board and 2 kayaks, tons of floats, life vests, fishing poles etc). The beds were comfortable and the house is spacious. The pool table/ping pong table combo was a huge hit. Lake Keowee is a beautiful lake and we rented a boat to take full advantage of the nice dock at the house. We cannot wait to come back! Theresa was a wonderful host. She provided needed information and responded quickly. She even mailed a book we accidentally left back to us. The neighborhood is peaceful and the neighbors were friendly."

The house was the perfect size to accommodate our entire party comfortably and had all the amenities we needed. They were so thoughtful and communicative and made every effort to ensure we had a great stay. The house is beautiful with incredible private access to the lake. What a vacation - thank you both!

Stayed with kids","We should have been arrested for having such a good time! Felt at home and like family. The most friendly hosts we’ve ever dealt with and they want you to enjoy your stay! Thought of everything if you forgot something! Great kitchen and sitting area, good cooking and even better visiting. Being a family of “doers”, we typically have difficult slowing down and relaxing. Walked in and downshifted by 3 gears! My grandsons now declared this their second favorite place, only beaten by our yearly trip to the mountains of VA. The whole family voted to come back next year! The dock was great for swimming, sunning, fishing (caught 8.5 million bream and 7 catfish 2 pounds and up). Pool table/ping pong table combo was a big hit with everyone. I cannot give enough stars to reflect the value of this home."

Deep water with several great coves to explore in kayaks, canoes etc. She is a great and thoughtful host, providing rafts (already inflated!), extra towels, coffee, popcorn, pancake mix…. Forgot your toothbrush? There are extra ones as well as travel toiletries. The drive is super quick from Atlanta and she is in a nice quiet neighborhood with streets to walk for some exercise. This was our second year at Theresa’s for Labor Day and we were so happy to be back😊"

Upon arrival, my daughter encountered a birthday gift for her birthday week. Theresa also provided a pancake bar, s’mores bar, ice cream, life jackets, floats and even an “Oops” closet for things we may have forgotten. All these things added up to providing a stay which made us feel welcome and at home. Theresa checked in several times to ensure everything was to our liking. All in all, she was a wonderful host!"

Stayed with kids","Fabulous host and just a perfect getaway home, right on the lake. We wanted to get out for a weekend on the lake to celebrate our daughter's HS graduation with family and friends. The location was perfect as it was just a few minutes from Publix and waterfront property to lake Keowee. Theresa was the perfect host and the property was exactly as pictured and described. The home was spacious, clean, and well stocked with all necessities and extras like games, snacks, life vest, and water toys! You do have to walk down to the dock/lake but it's all paved or wooded staircase so nothing to hold anyone back from. It was also the perfect spot for us to rent a boat and jet skis from Lake Keowee Boat Rentals who drop the boats in the water at South Cove County Park just around the corner from the home's dock. We could not have asked for a better home for our weekend getaway!"

The dock stays warm and sunny all day and her location just off the main part of the lake is perfect for exploring without tons of high speed boat traffic. The house has plenty of space with several sitting areas, a large gas grill, ping pong, pool table and a weight room. Theresa is easy to communicate with and responds quickly. A perfect getaway."

Stayed with kids","We had a great time at this lake house! The multi-floor setup makes it easy to house multiple families (we had my family including kids and grandparents, so the grandparents got their own space downstairs). The pool table and ping pong table were enjoyable distractions during the hottest parts of the day. We appreciated many of the little amenities, like floats, popcorn, s’mores materials, etc. We found the kitchen well-stocked with essentials and appreciated having some video streaming services to use. The dock setup is nice for hanging out. I will say, if you are not very fit, it could be hard to put the kayaks in the water — the path down to the dock is really steep. Worked for us, though! Also, the driveway is super steep and a little bit unnerving, but there is a parking pad on the road where you can walk down if that makes you uncomfortable. Overall, it was a really chill place to relax as a family on summer vacation."

Group trip","Beautiful home and dock!! Lots of space. Bedrooms upstairs with tv in every room on 3rd floor - Big comfortable beds and bedrooms!! One bedroom on first floor and fun pool and ping pong table. Lots of extra touches and amenities like kayaks, stand up paddle board and a canoe. Well stocked kitchen
And big empty fridge to put all your food in when you arrive. Expect to walk up and down stairs and concrete combo walkways to and from the dock!! Good workout! Only negative is you can run out of hot water if everyone is taking showers at about the same time and it takes a while to get upstairs. I enjoyed the big whirlpool bathtub after a long day on the water!! Wasn’t a fan of the couches as they were not very firm but that’s me. All in all we were very happy in this big spacious beautiful home and hope to return!!"

Stayed a few nights",Upon our arrival Theresa and I had communicated a great deal before getting there. She knew we were coming in town for a reunion of friends from Seneca High for my fiance's birthday. She provided us with warming birthday goodies on the counter. We were able to rent a boat from the marina and the deep water dock made it awesome for us to be able to keep the boat for the entire weekend. It was amazing to get together and troll around on the pontoon to see old rope swings the boys had tied up when they were younger. Lots of memory lane and sharing stories with wives and children. We hope to come visit again and enjoy the peacefulness of Lake Keowee.

Stayed with kids","The house is large and has all the amenities you will need for your family vacation.
If you have small children you will need life jackets for the lake since there is not a easily accessible beach area and it is deep at the dock. But that is the only thing I would suggest or ensure a family knows who is coming in. Our grandson is 6 and did fine with the water since he can swim well and had a life jacket as well.
The paddle board is great and our grandson loved it along with our grown children.
Bring a float and just relax. The water is smooth and so relaxing since there is not a lot of boats back in the cove. You can relax and enjoy the peace and quiet. And you are only 5 mins by car or boat to the marina. We were able to bring a boat and left it at the dock the entire stay.
Teresa is a great host and she was quick to respond to all of my questions before and during our trip.
The house has all of the amenities you will need for cooking, grilling etc.
We highly recommend this home for a long wkd or family get away.
The neighborhood is also very safe and nice. You will not be disappointed."

Stayed over a week","I can’t say enough good things about Regina and this home! It is exactly as described and then some. It is super clean, and everything that you could possibly need is provided. It was so nice to just relax after a ten hour drive instead of having to run to the store for paper towels or shampoo. If you’re looking for a beautiful, tranquil location, this is it! With a pass that allows you entrance to the local parks, you can spend lots of time hiking, kayaking or just relaxing at the lake.
Communication with Regina was flawless, and she was very accommodating (thank you for the recycling bins!). I would definitely stay here again, and will be sure to recommend this place to friends and family that may be in the area:)"

Stayed a few nights","Pam is a great host and was so easy to work with. The room itself was clean, well kept, and cozy. It's a great basement apartment-type space to have to ourselves for a couple of days. It's spacious and easy to come and go with its exterior private access door. The bathroom has a great walk-in shower and actually fit both of us! Host is very kind and a good communicator!
Things to know about this room: the mattress is very firm. I was comfortable in it and slept well but I know that's not everyone's preference. The window coverings don't offer complete privacy BUT it's in a very quiet neighborhood that is spaced out well. The home is surrounded by trees. A stand-up privacy screen (Shoji) is also set up next to the bed, which was very nice. The private bathroom is separate from the room so you do have to walk through the basement but it's easy to go back and forth from.
All in all this was a great deal in the perfect location for us. Would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed with a pet","The Blue Room is terrific! A neat mix of vintage and modern and all impeccably clean and neat. Pam has thought of everything right down to the homemade peanut butter cookies greeting you. Perfect for one or two. There is more space than it looks like from the pictures. Wry comfortable bed, something I don’t always find at AirBnBs. Private entry a few steps from parking spot. Note that the bathroom as well as microwave are out in the (finished) basement but it’s only a few steps away. I had a little trouble finding the driveway
But that’s because I arrived late at night and my GPS was being stupid. Host Pam came out in her PJs to assist me. I’ve stayed at a lot of Airbnbs and this one, although essentially a basement studio apartment and not fancy, really stands out as an exceptional."

A large refrigerator/freezer and microwave, as well as a full bathroom, are also downstairs in the other half of a huge basement.
Pam provided slices of a freshly made pumpkin cake. She was also quite helpful and well-informed about areas of interest in the area. We particularly enjoyed the Cobb County Park ($3/car) some 5 miles away, where we ate a picnic dinner on the water and then played pickleball ball (among athletic local young people) with the water always in view in the background.
We recommend Pam's Place highly."

We messaged Pam late at night, and much to our surprise, she allowed us to stay on late notice. The accommodations were immaculate, affordable, and easy to access. The bathroom is through the back door and to the right. We had the most amazing impromptu stay, and I will be forever grateful as I had my children with me.
I highly recommend Pam's beautiful blue room and would have also even had we planned to stay here ahead of time. I will aways stay here as long as it is available!"

I'm only sorry I didn't have time to explore as my stay was less than 24 hours; I would definitely re-book Molly's place if ever in the area again. All the amenities I needed were available (coffee, hairdryer); Molly even left a basket of cookies and fruit. Although this is a tiny house (<300 sq ft), I think it was laid out well enough for 2 adults (one queen(?) bed). The large shower had good water pressure and quickly heated. The full-size refrigerator, stove (oven), and bedroom closet would allow for a lengthy stay without having to go out for food or shuffle suitcases around."

This tiny home is just what we needed. It was very clean and had all the amenities we needed. This was also our first Airbnb stay so we weren’t sure how it all worked. But it was an easy process and Molly’s excellent communication made it even easier. We will definitely stay here again!

Very clean, cozy minimalist space but just the right amount especially for a couple 😊 we checked in late but she allowed us a later checkout and it was perfect for us because we didn’t want to leave quite yet!! Pots/pans, utensils, keurig coffee maker with lots of k cups/sugar/ creamer etc needed for coffee. The set up was very nice and location was very peaceful. We will be back!!!"

We bought a small space heater and did just fine. Would definitely visit again based on cleanliness, price, and location.

It appeared to be fairly recently updated and, best of all, was very clean. Before booking I noticed one review that mentioned bugs. However, we didn't see a single bug during out stay. The bed was quite comfortable and the bath towels super plush. Best of all, Rick and his wife Nancy were very accommodating and helpful when we were having difficulty checking in. Would definitely look into staying here again next time we're in the area."

Stayed a few nights","The house is down a road in the woods and doesn't have curb appeal but once you are inside it's like a hidden oasis. AMAZING! Views are incredible. Porch is amazing. They even swept a path to the beach and to the dock through the woods so it was clear where to walk. Every attention to detail including makeup remover and round eye make up remover pads. Also, the hair dryer was new and awesome versus many hotels that have old smelly hair dryers that don't dry your hair well.
I loved the two big beds in the master BR because my daughter and I got to stay in there her last night before college and be in the same room but still have a great nights sleep.
Love to stay here again soon and tried to but it's booked so act quickly to get a reservation. It's a rare find."

House lacks bells and whistles such as tvs in every room- but we do not go to the lake for that! I appreciated that there was a pantry stocked with spices, condiments and odds & ends - not just the emergency things we normally see. It kinda felt like this family was coming back often and left us a well stocked kitchen! We played cards every evening on the porch at the picnic table. Rented a boat from clemson marina.

A gas grill would be a nice addition, but cooking on charcoal worked just fine. The house is very private, and the view is amazing form inside and out, so if it rains, you can still enjoy the beauty of the lake from the living room. Very convenient to Clemson and fun for kayaking as well, if you have your own boats. Great hosts!"

Stayed with kids","This house was wonderful. The location was fabulous because it was just a few doors down from our really good friends. We spend a week every year with two other couples and their kids. This is the first year that we got our own house because our families have become so large. The property that the house sits on and the view of the lake is picturesque. The house is cozy, clean and very well-stocked. We joked that it felt like we were just staying at an old friends house. Not pretentious, just really warm and comfortable. We spent every day in the water or on a boat skiing and tubing. We even went to dinner by water. That doesn’t mean that the location is not fantastic. You’re only a few minutes from a great convenient store that caters to the students that may not be able to go to a grocery store. With that being said, shopping and dining is only 15 minutes away.
This was the perfect getaway. Hopefully we will be able to return soon."

The property is great for a small family and is dog friendly as well. Also really liked the location as it is close to Clemson as well as some great restaurants in Seneca. Next time we head to Clemson, we will definitely try to book Christina's place again."

One of the best value AirBnB's we've stayed in. It was just our family - with 2 couples or a group, it would be ridiculously value priced.

The wash cloths especially for the removal of makeup in the bathroom were great. The beds were super comfy, the kids loved all the games... they didn't want to leave. They thought our trip was solely to go to stay at this place, and they were perfectly happy staying there.
My favorite is the coffee bar. Amazing! I really loved the two options, I have a nespresso machine at home. Appliances are amazing, easy to get in, great parking, amazing back yard, I will absolutely stay here again!"

The only issue is the beds cover the a/c vents in the bedrooms so it was a little stuffy. We used the one stand up fan they had provided but it could use ceiling fans in the bedrooms. Other than that wonderful location in Seneca close to Clemson and the lakes. The master bed is a sleep number mattress and felt amazing! The games and fire pit will have to wait until next time we visit!

I jet ski and boat around the country and if your looking for good parking and within 30 minutes of lakes hartwell, keowee, and jocassie not sure if spelled right this would be a perfect property to rent if your staying on the lake
thank you for allowing us in your property"

The bathroom has plenty of big soft towels, and all the little details and hospitality items you could need. The living area has an oversized couch and chair, games, and a big TV. This little cottage is perfect. You drive down a private driveway to an adorable bungalow overlooking a pond. You are greeted with a wraparound porch. On the side there is an outdoor dining table and grill. The front of the porch has the cutest porch swing and Adirondak chairs to take in the sunset. This little house is bright and warm and a home away from home. We wouldn't think of staying anywhere else when we come down to this area again!"

Only a few minutes to Clemson, quiet neighborhood, extremely clean and comfortable home with all the amenities you need including a fully stocked coffee/tea station. Mara even welcomed us to her home with a box of doughnuts. Instructions for check-in and check-out were simple. Communication with our host was equally simple. Highly recommended this home and hope to be able to stay there again."

My kids loved the swing in the backyard and the toys that she already has available. The crib and high chair were SO convenient for us with our one year old daughter! It relieved so much stress to not have to worry about bringing every single baby item with us. All of the mattresses are incredibly comfortable. I wished we had more time to just sleep. The home is impeccably decorated and spotless. We felt right at home. Thank you!

The coffee/tea station was AMAZING and went well with the doughnuts she so thoughtfully left us! There was bottled water, natural soaps at the sinks, and there were no chemical smells from cleaning products when we arrived- this was very important to us AND something I had asked Mara about ahead of time. I was happy she responded that she uses unscented detergents, too! The backyard was so inviting and we loved the privacy looking out the back door. And the pancake making station was over-the-top special! Mara responded very quickly every time I wrote. She even made check out the least stressful of any AirBnB we've ever stayed in! Thank you, Mara!"

Had everything we needed for our stay. They even went above and beyond to make a small ramp into their front entrance for my father who is in a wheel chair. The neighborhood is very quiet and has a one way in and one way out. We also loved how they decorated their home for Christmas, had a tree set up in the living room, in one of the bedroom and lights outside of their home. They truly made spending the holidays away from home so special. Thank you again for sharing your lovely home with us!"

We have close family who are super sensitive to fragrances so we have been a fragrance free family and often get sensitive to smells now as well. It was wonderful to be in a home where we did not smell air fresheners, cleaner, or laundry detergent on the linens. We were excited to see the detergent was the free and clear kind that we also use. If you are sensitive to fragrances, this is the place to stay!
Our host was very quick with responses and even helped get us local numbers we had inquired about. The donuts were also a fun surprise! Highly recommend."

Stayed one night","The house was very clean. Mara left donuts as a treat which was unexpected and appreciated. She also was fantastic to communicate with throughout our experience.
The one thing we did not like is that the space is actively being lived in. There are personal items throughout the home, clothes in closet, food in fridge/freezer, etc. There was very limited options to hang up clothes. 2 hangers in the master and a couple in the guest room. Nothing usable in the little girls room to hang clothes or put them away. We have ever experienced people actively living in a rental through Airbnb (and even Vrbo) before. We probably would not rent again because of this. If that’s not a big deal, the space was great and very clean."

My husband got to tag along this trip and he really enjoyed it as well. We were both taking notes for our future home later in life. The home is always super clean and there is a little area in the kitchen to make waffles with the mix available for preparing. Also the coffee bar has really great selections with tea as well.

The other two bedrooms were just as great with a tv in the additional guest room if you want to just relax and unwind in your room. Extra points for the propane grill for dinner, the waffle maker and Keurig coffee options to wake up to. Mara was very responsive from the start to the end of the process and accommodated our last minute decision to stay an extra night. The house is not a gimmick, what you see is what you pay for and I really appreciate the overall cleanliness. I also like that it has a “homey” feeling vs a hotel room with even much more to offer. Thank you for the true hospitality of your home and service Mara, our family enjoyed it thoroughly!"

Just be aware of what car you drive. There’s a dirt/gravel road to come up to the driveway we almost got stuck with the van lol after the first time we figured it out though.
15 miles out from Toccoa, Ga and about 10 minutes from Seneca,SC with stuff to do. An hour away from Helen, Ga.

Bonnie’s Cottage is perfect in every way. After we checked in we really didn’t want to leave. It was so peaceful and quiet and so inviting. Decor was beautiful. Bonnie thought of everything we might have needed and more. ( even extras).
We will definitely be back to visit again soon. Also recommend it to family and friends. Thank you Bonnie for sharing your cottage with us. You are an excellent host and communicator.

All the craftwork inside was well done, solid and professional, not like some short term rentals which feel slapped together and cheap. This place really felt like a vacation home that the owner would want to stay in herself and it reflected in all the details that make a joke feel like a home. 10/10, we will definitely be back when we come visit the area again!"

Stayed one night","Bonnie was very helpful and communicative when checking in. Even though it is a tiny house, it felt very spacious and comfortable; it could easily sleep five people. The outside was also very cute with the lights, bbq, and hammock. Only thing to take into consideration is that the road leading up to the property might be a little tricky for low vehicles. I have a low car and was still able to make it up but had to be careful. Overall it was a great experience and if I’m ever back in the area I’ll know of a comfortable place I would return to."

The cottage itself is decorated super cutely (which the photos accurately show) along with a super easy check in. Bonnie was super attentive and responded right away to any questions we had! The location was perfect as it is set up a hill a little in the woods away from everything else, but just 10 minutes from a grocery store. My husband and I greatly appreciated the waterfalls guidebook that was provided and used it to visit Minnehaha Waterfall as well as the Sliding Rock at Wildcat! We would definitely recommend this as a perfect little getaway spot!"

It felt very private, yet it wasn't far from grocery stores and some restaurants. The home was stocked well with dishes and cookware.

There are helpful reminders and instructions posted in easily found places so you're never left wondering about check-out processes, wifi password, etc.
Speaking of, I did some online work while I was there and the internet was fast enough to let me access everything I needed to and stream some tv shows besides!
I would note that there are quite a few decorations with a Christian theme (mostly scriptures). That didn't bother me at all, but I just want to warn anyone who may be more sensitive about displays of faith.
Overall, this was a lovely, cost-efficient place to stay and Bonnie was a wonderful host!"

Stayed one night","I booked a stay at this nice place but as the day approached, my job scheduled a meeting for us to attend. I already committed my stay here and it would've been too far to try to make it to afterwards. I thought about cancelling but I discussed with Bonnie for my wife and her friend to do a ladies day instead. She okayed it and they went instead. They loved this place. Always neat and clean. Very cozy and well thought out. The two of them enjoyed their stay. Her friend loved the loft and how comfortable the bed was. The next morning, Bonnie sent me a message notifying me that my wife car had a flat and she was sending someone to help her. You can imagine the anxiety of your spouse in need and you are too far away to help. Bonnie sent help to help fix my wife flat and she asked if anything else she can do. This is a host with great character and care for the people she open her home to. She is one of the nicest, caring host I have encountered on this site. I'm forever grateful to her for looking out for my wife and friend. You're a kind caring woman, God bless you."

Stayed a few nights","We loved our stay at Brooke's cottage. Bonnie checked in with us after we arrived to see if we needed anything. The cottage is lovely and had everything we needed for the week, even information about area waterfalls, so we could plan our activities for the day. We highly recommend Brooke's Cottage."

Stayed a few nights","Bonnie’s place was wonderful! Exactly as described and pictured, plus extras here and there. Nice quiet location, but not *too* remote. We felt safe and secure throughout our trip and Bonnie was always incredibly responsive, sometimes within seconds! Overall a great experience and would definitely stay again!"
