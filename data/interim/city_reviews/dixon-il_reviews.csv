Group trip","The river house was nice, and had a lot of great items in the kitchen for cooking and living room for entertaining. The grill didn’t work, but we enjoyed the large fire pit and they had a lot of wood to burn and cookware to put meat in to roast over the fire so we were able to make meals over the fire which was nice. Bring a lighter though because starting the fire was an interesting achievement for us day one, but day two we were able to keep it going from the night before. The water pressure wasn’t that great, but the bathrooms were fully stocked, and clean. The kids had a great time listening to records, and playing their guitar. We all enjoyed river view, their canoe is gorgeous, and while we didn’t catch any fish, it was a charming, cozy stay in a nice river home. Our children had a blast!"

Group trip","This was my first experience renting an Airbnb, and I couldn't be more impressed! Elizabeth was an exceptional host. She contacted me before the trip and gave me detailed information to make our check in easy and helpful information to help us make the most out of our stay.
The house was in pristine condition and had ALL the amenities you would need. Truly all you need to bring is food, the rest is already there to enjoy! You can tell that Elizabeth has spent a lot of care and time into making sure her guests enjoy their stay. She was very friendly and easy to communicate with.
The location is right on the Rock River and close to surrounding towns. You don't need to leave, but if you do, there are many things close in the area to enjoy.
I would absolutely book with her again!"

Group trip","We had an amazing stay at this Riverfront Retreat in Oregon, Illinois! The spacious and cozy interior, updated kitchen, and delightful river views made our time truly special. The deck with a BBQ and the backyard fire pit added to the charm. The location is perfect, just minutes away from hiking spots and the river access is a bonus. The recent renovations and thoughtful amenities, like the pack-and-play, made it family-friendly. Whether you’re looking to fish, hike, or simply unwind, this retreat has it all. Highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights",We enjoyed the beautiful sunrise and sunset over the tops of the trees each day. A bald eagle showed up around 4pm almost every evening to rest for while in full view across the river. A bird lovers spot with all forest on the other side of the river. My husband and I enjoyed cooking in the open kitchen. So nice to cook in a kitchen that is set up by someone that cooks. We especially liked the beautiful wood cutting boards. We both slept great each night. So private and peaceful. We reluctantly left to go hiking each day. We look forward to staying here again in the future.

Stayed with kids","This place was just what we needed. A countryside getaway in the fall at a beautiful property, furnished with all the comforts, with lovely indoors and outdoors. The place had everything for our family with senior parents to a 1 year old infant.
Elizabeth was proactive, kind and easy to communicate with, even in the middle of a major life event. She shared local recommendations and pointed us to various resources at home for our kid. We cooked, had a campfire, hiked at nearby trails, took walks around the property, and cozied up next to the fireplace with a book and hot chocolate.
Will definitely be going back for the summer!"

Stayed a few nights","One of my favorite airbnbs so far! I was looking for a waterfront place, and this country home by the river was perfect. My friend and I would take our chairs and sit and read or talk down by the river...so peaceful watching the river and the fish jump. The house itself is decorated with a quiet palette, and the way the kitchen is stocked with spices and pots and pans (even vanilla!) and the bathroom has extra toothpaste in a drawer, feels very thoughtful and welcoming. My bed was very comfortable as well. The only possible drawback, which doesn't deter me from coming back, is that there is some periodic road noise from Illinois 2, but you don't hear it in the house."

Beautiful view of the river and great fishing on the bank right outside the house. Area is very private and peaceful, we would definitely like to come back someday. We had a little issue with the garage door and the DVD player and Elizabeth was quick to respond. Oregon itself was very nice also. Plenty of hiking, antique shopping and we did kayaking on the river....Thanks again Elizabeth for a memorable time!"

Stayed with kids","If I could give this place 6 or 7 stars, I would. With Airbnb filled to the rafters with perfectly acceptable but soulless accommodation, this is throw back to the platform's early days.
Elizabeth's house backs on to the Rock River, and it's off the main road so it's wonderfully secluded. Outside the main things we heard were cicadas and the river. It's so relaxing.
Inside, the house has been tastefully renovated and feels lived in. The kitchen is stocked with almost every item imaginable, the cookware is top grade, and there are plenty of condiments and spices to make tasty meals. (Side hint: get some local corn, it's crazy sweet and delicious.)
The couch, and beds are all very comfortable. And although we only spent a few nights here, we felt fully refreshed.
There's plenty to do at house too with canoes, a zip line, fishing gear, plenty of kids' toys, and board games.
Internet is available, but it's slow, which was great for our needs, but not if you want to work remotely."

Elizabeth was also a great host, she was very responsive and made sure check in went well as well as check out. The River house also had everything you might need for your stay.

Stayed with kids","We wanted a country getaway for our family (kids aged 2, 4, and 7), and we could not have asked for a better time. The house is stocked with joys for kids: games, toys, a mini kitchen and chalk board, and even a vintage school desk filled with art supplies. The kids' room had everything you would need if you had smaller children: baby monitors, a pack & play, portable high chair, etc. Outside there is a mowed pathway along the river (no swimming due to the current) and the garage had lots of treasures for kids and adults alike: a canoe, fishing poles, a ""bags"" set, and other outdoor games. There is even a mini zip line my kids spent hours on, dragging one another back / forth. With four bedrooms, everyone slept comfortably and peacefully. There is a motion detector light in the hallway for middle-of-the-night needs. We visited during the Ogle County Fair, so between carnival rides, cotton candy, running/zipping around the River House, my 7 year old said it was the best day of her life!"

Stayed a few nights","My wife needed some time to reconnect with nature in a beautiful setting and a slower pace of life for a few days. This place absolutely delivered.
THE SETTING: the drive to the home through small towns, state parks and rolling hills is a retreat in and of itself.
THE PROPERTY: After you drive down a narrow paved drive, you come to a gravel road path which immediately reminds you that life is now slower and simpler and to pump the brakes and look around. The old home looks like a miniature farm house mansion-of-old. The pictures on the Airbnb site are nice, but pale in comparison to the actual charm we felt pulling up. Out back it's just you, trees & the Rock River.
THE HOUSE: Nice modern finishes coupled with vintage touches. The kitchen has everything you may need, most brand new, including a Brita in the fridge with filtered H2O, a stocked Keurig, appliances, etc. FYI there is no recycling on site. Upstairs there are four perfectly quant bedrooms with new bathrooms. We'll be back"

Ideal for families, with plenty of games and child-friendly furnishings. Every detail caters to comfort and convenience—offering a large communal area with multiple hangout areas both in and outside. Luxurious mattresses with extra linens and towels. Fully equipped kitchen with a complimentary espresso machine. Only a 9-minute drive to restaurants and a 10-minute drive to a golf course.
This island home is not just a place to stay—it’s a destination in itself, promising an unforgettable experience that combines the serenity of an island retreat with the comforts of a luxury home. It’s a must-book for anyone looking to unwind and indulge in the beauty of nature with all the comforts of modern living!"

Group trip","First, I'll give you the good- The place is a lovely house, and the location is beautiful. The site is truly an island and is very private.
However, I will tell you that my issue with this place was the mice problem. Every room had evidence of mice droppings—even Some of the drawers in the kitchen. Twice in broad daylight, we saw a mouse running from one end of the room to the other. I understand that the house is by a river and the the first night, I told my kids, ""It's because we are by a river."" But then, I noticed how it was a bigger problem: bad. There are plenty of ways to combat this problem; there is no reason for this. It is very unhealthy for anyone staying there."

Group trip","A nice house with many places to entertain inside and out. Plenty of beds, linens, pillows, an air mattress.
One bedroom with 3 beds has a small window A/C and there's larger window unit in the living room. It was over 100F outside when we arrived so it took a little time to cool. The bar and pool table rooms in the basement stayed cool though without A/C. I would bring fans for the other bedrooms if it's going to be over 90F but we were outside 90% of our time thanks to the kayaks, hot tub, fire pit, sauna, paddle boat, grill, smoker, fishing, etc.
Bring your own tupperware, Ziploc bags, and paper towels but otherwise the kitchen is well-stocked.
For kayaking, plan to walk back from the nearby boat launch if you leave the cove because if it's rained recently, you won't be able to paddle against the current to come back.
An overall great weekend with 8 of us, each in our own bed, which is hard to find!"

Hot tub and sauna with views of the river were amazing. River is really low from the lack of rain but kids still had plenty of fish to keep them busy. Large umbrellas on front and back decks were nice addition for warm sunny days. Assume being on the river with a shallow well and low water level may have caused the sulfur smell in the water faucets. Other then that wonderful memorable experience!

Stayed with kids","The Private Island House is a great opportunity to unwind on beautiful grounds with many amenities. It was very clean and the new furniture was pristine, as well as cozy. There isn't, however, a second living room with three more sleeping places. I recommend confirming with the owner about any changes to the property before you arrive, in case that has been updated. Our group was hoping to use the extra sleeping spaces so we wouldn't have to double-up, but those sleeping spaces didn't exist. Additionally, the hot tub was not in safe condition (brown water) upon arrival so I suggest you confirm with the owner that the issue has been resolved before booking your stay. Lastly, I recommend you bring your own towels as we did not have enough to accommodate our group."

Heather is the most thoughtful, gracious host. She included all the information we may need from restaurant recommendations to surrounding places and things to do. It is the perfect getaway to disconnect from the world for a few days and enjoy family. Honestly I can't say enough about this place, there is more than enough room for a group of up to 16 people. The lounging areas outside & sitting in nature made it even better. Just 2 hours outside of Chicago. A quick & nice getaway for me to relax and enjoy my Birthday with family and the weather was nice considering it's February. Me and my family plan to return soon! If you came across this Airbnb and you are considering booking GO FOR IT! you won't be disappointed."

Stayed with kids","My family of 11 (inc 4 teenage grandkids who love space away from the adults) used Heather’s cabin for our Christmas get-together. The house is so beautiful on its own but Heather even went a step further by putting out some Christmas decorations and a 14’ foot Christmas tree in front of the two story windows. Gorgeous. Lots of beds, 4 full bathrooms, big kitchen, big sectional with large tv in the living room, and a huge family room/game room downstairs for the teens. We live in 3 directions - all 3 hrs from the house - so such a treat to all be together in one house for 3 days. All in all - pretty perfect for my family. As we were leaving, my grandkids asked when we were coming back. I said soon."

Heather was a great host and she provided answers to questions ahead of time for us to be able to pack what we needed and even checked on us the first morning to be sure we were comfortable!
One thing if you have a larger group…be sure to bring some extra towels!
We will definitely be returning in warmer weather so we can enjoy the outdoor areas more!!
Thanks Heather for helping our family make lots of memories together!!"

Our kids were able to meet for the first time and all the adults were able to jump right back in to college days like we never left. The house gave each family privacy with their own rooms but had the perfect size living spaces for everyone to hang out together as well. I hope we choose to use this place in the future for our yearly college get together s. The host was amazing. Timely and very helpful. Just a beautiful place and very private which made it even more peaceful. I would recommend this listing to anyone looking for a quiet weekend. 10/10 just awesome and thank you Heather for being an amazing host.

Remote for TV was missing. Never did find it, but we found plenty of other nasty stuff under sofa cushions & beds. Faucets in master bath were very loose & the deck is deteriorating. Heather was understanding & apologetic and gave us a partial refund of the cleaning fee."

Group trip","What a great place to stay! Very convenient to Dixon and Oregon. We were in the area for our son's wedding. We were able to have my sisters and their families, and our mom and dad stay under the same roof. With all those people you could still find a quiet spot if you chose. It is difficult ult to find because GPS wants to take you through a neighborhood that the property backs up to , but there is no access that way. Heather was very clear in her check-in instructions to point this out and give you instructions how to get there. We only had trouble with those arriving after dark.
Heather is very responsive, flexible, and pleasant. We will definitely stay again when we are back in the area."

The beds were comfy and noise did not carry from the main living areas to the bedrooms. The kids loved the arcade game in the basement and the big kitchen was a great gathering spot.
A few things that needed attention. The fireplaces did not work, there were quite a few lightbulbs out throughout the house, one of the sinks was leaking, and one of the bathroom doors wouldn’t fully close. All minor inconveniences that didn’t make a big impact on the overall trip but should be fixed.
We had a great time overall."

We ventured into Dixon and Oregon for brunch and a little shopping and it was great. Especially loved Cork and Tap for drinks. Heather was very responsive to questions and the place is as described.
One little thing to note, none of the fireplaces are operating right now as they are waiting for an inspector to come and it didn't sound like they knew when that would be possible. We were a little bummed that we didn't know that until 2 days before our stay but it wouldn't have changed our decision to book.
We would definitely visit again, especially when the weather is warmer so we can take advantage of the large deck and nearby trails."

We turned the backyard into the wedding of our dreams. The home was so spacious and we were able to have about 10 of our friends and family members stay with us all weekend. We used the loft as the bridal suite and the lower level was used as the groomsmen room. Which was so perfect because they were able to use the arcade games, darts and foosball.
The house was secluded and so well stocked and all our guests were very impressed!

Group trip",I stayed at this cabin 17-20th of December for a birthday getaway ! And I was a little nervous booking because the property had no previous reviews and the pictures looked amazing so I thought it was too good to be true! THE CABIN WAS AMAZING ! It look just like the pictures everything was cleaned I had no issue durning my stay .. the only thing that was missing was a fire pit outside because I really wanted to roast s’mores and no WiFi was available but everything was amazing I will be coming back ! Thank you Heather

Stayed one night","Miguel was an awesome host and his place was amazing! The home has a beautiful welcoming living area with comfy couches and a large screen TV. The home had a well stocked kitchen and was super clean and cozy! Tons of games and activities indoors: board games, chess, foosball, air hockey and Pac-Man arcade. The rooms were all very nice and comfortable each boasting a smart TV and comfy mattresses. The basement also had a sofa bed and a twin bed as well. The backyard is massive and the patio furniture and grill was perfect for entertaining family and friends. The volleyball net, basketball hoop and soccer net outdoors made the space extra fun for the kids. We wrapped up the evening with a nice bonfire around the fire pit. I would definitely visit again in the future!!"

My husband grew up one block away on Fellows St
We loved walking around the neighborhood and reminiscing his childhood memories.
While walking Jim stopped and talked to lifelong friends that still live there.
Grandma’s House was the perfect location for family and friends to come visit while we were there.
It’s very open and spacious with several sitting areas to accommodate all our visitors.
Judith had the refrigerator and cabinets stocked with anything and everything we could possibly need.
Every kitchen appliance you can imagine.
The dining room had large dining table as well as dining table in the kitchen.
The downstairs has a half bath for easy access.
All three bedrooms are upstairs with a large spacious bathroom. In addition Judith has cribs, toys, extra blankets, etc .
Basically anything above and beyond.
Grandma would be so proud ❤️

Judi was an amazing host. She went above and beyond all of our expectations! She bent over backwards, on a holiday, for us. She did more than we even asked for.
""Grandma's house"" was a very accurate. I couldn't believe the decor... many of the decorations were the exact same ones my grandma had! Even those that weren't exactly the same were definitely her style. It was like a trip down memory lane.. just like my grandma's house, only much bigger and with WiFi, BluRay, and Smart TVs! Tons of books, and games, and movies for the kids, too! Plenty of room for our extended family and a big Thanksgiving dinner! Fully stocked, had almost everything you could possibly need already available, even food staples for us to use.
Also, very clean, comfortable, and good value for the amount of space! Would definitely stay there if we need a place in Dixon again!"

Group trip","Grandma’s House is a great place to stay. Great location to downtown Dixon, walking distance to the YMCA and a town park. The home is large enough to host many people and cozy enough to feel like home. We loved the large screened in porch and the cozy tv room! The pictures are accurate to what’s there and the amenities are so helpful during the stay. The extras that are there are so helpful!"

Stayed with kids","Our family really enjoyed our time at Grandma's House – and both my wife and I thought it reminded us of our own grandmother's homes! Our kids enjoyed playing with the toys and also enjoyed the candies in bowls around the house. We quickly came to realize if we needed something, it was probably there somewhere – the house is well stocked. The kitchen had all the appliances and accessories you'd need, and there was plenty of bedding provided. The host made us feel very welcome and had a great response time to texts. One of our favorite parts of the house had to be the screened in front porch – one day in particular it was raining and we ate a late lunch on the porch (which has tons of chairs and tables). It was such a great memory from our visit."

Judith has multiple cribs, high chairs, fans(a big plus for us not to travel with them!) and so much more. Even the tv room nook was perfect for the kids when we needed some peace and quiet. She left fresh fruit and refrigerator essentials for us, which made the first morning breakfast easy. 10/10 would recommend this house and host. She was quick to respond and very helpful."

She went above and beyond to make sure our group enjoyed and had comfortable time in Dixon. We had a group of children (11-16) year old and they loved the place. The house is so clean and had everything we wanted. If you are planning to travel to Dixon and you are looking for somewhere to stay look no further than ‘Grandmas House’
Great place and super Host.

It was such a nice treat to have everything we needed when we woke up from arriving late Friday night. Our kids especially enjoyed ""Alexa"" to play music & learn cool trivia. There were several air mattresses available & pull out couches for additional sleeping accommodations. We would most certainly rent here again when visiting our extended family in Dixon.

The kids had fun with ""Alexa"", and all of the smart TVs, WiFi, etc were nice to have available. There is only one shower/bath, but there surprisingly wasn't a hot water issue! So for larger groups, be prepared to make up a bath schedule. The closets are huge, and we were able to fit a crib or pack n play in each one! The house is conveniently close to a couple of parks, shopping and restaurants. Judith is sweet and amazing to work with! We all said we would rent her place again!"

Franklin Creek had some great trails right out your back door and we did try fishing but had no luck catching anything. We also enjoyed a trip to the Bison and the Mill which was extremely informative and amazing technology for its time! James and Dina are a great team providing information about the area and anything you might need! We also ate twice at the Lincolnway Cafe for breakfast, right up the street, which was delicious!

Watched loads of birds in the morning from the porch and bats in the evening, walked to close by trails and the creek for hiking, fishing, and exploring. It was just what I was looking for and my kids liked it’s too (all teenagers)."

The home is spacious and Dina's touches are fantastic. The kitchen is well stocked and even has spices and coffee. Charcoal and lighter fluid were provided for the grill. Firewood was provided for the firepit and brick pizza oven. The space is bright, clean and welcoming.
We are planning to be back soon!"

The town of Oregon is also worth a peek. They provided bug spray which was appreciated as the mosquitoes are rampant, but it was tolerable. We enjoyed the fire pit and star gazing at night. Bring your own essentials, some games, hiking gear, leave the pets at home, and enjoy yourself in farm country IL!"

Great hiking right behind the house, and a wonderful, big park with trails that would span for over 5 miles right across the street. It was hot hot hot! but the creek right by the trails provided great relief.
The house was big, with room for everybody, and very comfortable. And the best part is that they allowed us to bring our beagle with us! (he is very well behaved and low maintenance, so it worked just fine), which meant we all could enjoy the woods!
We are thinking of coming back in the fall, when it's not so hot. It is so pretty out there!"

Thanks for your hospitality and sharing your beautiful house. With 10 miles of horse trails behind, 6 miles of hiking in front, gas grill for suculent pork loin and beer battered bratworsts, I and my city-dwelling, nature-loving friends would return in a heart beat. Fresh air and fresher eggs (thanks Dina!) was the catalyst i needed for a much deserved recharge, Monday morning here I come! The hand made soaps in the bathroom was an especially nice touch. It was a shame though to find such poor produce in the heart of a vast farmland (Airbnb'rs lucky enough to book with Dina and James in the future make sure to stop at Wholefoods before hand)."

Stayed with a pet","This place is spectacular! The host is so detail-oriented and labeled each closet and drawer for guests convenience. Everything is provided here, including tons of DVDs, books, small games such as chess, and first aid supplies. You name it. The owner is extremely caring, loving, friendly and kind. He introduced the local area to me and sent me pics of the bisons, which I really appreciate. My mom and I totally enjoyed our stay and would love to visit here again.
If I could give 10 stars I would. I’ve been to many getaways on Airbnb, this is definitely one of the most impressive places I’ve been."

Super comfortable atmosphere.
Great quiet A/C on a hot weekend.
First class kitchen with all amenities.
Very quiet neighborhood with the pristine Nachusa grasslands in clear view.
Amazing bedroom comfort.
Lovely bathroom with great shower and water pressure.
Extraordinarily pet friendly.
We truly felt right at home and will return for a longer stay.
Thanks to Earl, Patricia and family for providing such clean, high- quality lodging at a great price.
Bravo!!

My only suggestion, and this is not meant to be criticism, would be to tidy up the landscaping around the house. It would just make it look a bit classier."

Apart from the fantastic scenery, the house was well-organized and had everything you might think you need to pack. Seasonings, appliances, coffee, etc. It was a very hot weekend and we were concerned about staying cool, but the ac system they had was more than enough to keep us completely cool while we were in the house.
We also noticed some past reviews about spotty wifi, but they must’ve made an upgrade because the wifi was perfectly fast and we had no issues. Same with the Roku tv.
This place is special and at a very reasonable price. I highly recommend you stay here given the chance."

It is easy to feel as though you are in the middle of nowhere, yet it is quick and easy to reach in under a couple of hours from Chicago. The bison were even right by the backyard fence to greet us, along with a beautiful sunset, on the day we arrived. We loved how quiet it was and how many stars you could see at night. We enjoyed playing board games and going for hikes in the many local state parks. We were so sad to leave! LHOTP has just about everything you could possibly need to be self sufficient and Earl & Patricia were always on hand and quick to respond to any questions, or provide suggestions for places to visit.

Stayed a few nights","Little House on the Prairie is amazing. Earl was very accommodating, and he responded within a few minutes (literally a few minutes, less than five) to any questions we had.
We saw the bison herd several times over the weekend. They never came near the fence at LHOTP, but we saw them at the visitor center and while driving around. We did see deer and a coyote and other wildlife from the back patio.
We were delighted to see how well-stocked LHOTP is. We have been to many vacation properties in our travels, but we certainly over-packed for this one.
Some of the things we always take on vacations but could have left at home:
• A good variety of spices. In fact, there is a cabinet pretty much devoted to spices. We brought a couple of our favorites that LHOTP didn't have, but we could have saved the space and not packed our own at all.
• Ice
• Ketchup, mustard, mayo, Cholula, butter, a brand new unopened block of Monterey Jack cheese, Sriracha, and many other things. The frig door shelves were full of all kinds of goodies.
• Coffee, tea, bottled water, creamers
• Sugar
• Hand soap for the kitchen and bathroom
• Bug sprays
I could go on.
The only negative thing I have to say is the internet is a little iffy. But is that really a negative thing when you're trying to get away for a peaceful weekend? It just helped us realize that there were better things to do than to be checking emails.
All in all, LHOTP is a great get-away spot. We definitely will be going back!"

It was everything that was described in the listing. When you first pull up to the property you would never know how cute the inside is or how vast the backyard and bison reserve behind the house was.
The cottage is an open floor concept and is very spacious. The kitchen area has tons of stuff to use and every cabinet and door is labelled. No confusions finding anything.
The Bison never came near the backyard while we were there, but we went to the Bison welcome center three times. The welcome center is down the road and we got to see the herd everytime we went. We also got to view other wildlife while we were there. The sunsets and sunrises were breath taking!"

The wifi wasn’t very strong, probably enough to get messages out but that wasn’t hugely important for us on our unplugged weekend. They have plenty of movies and board games and almost everything you need to have a unwinding time there. And they even have a grill (with propane) that we used to bbq every night. We even got lucky and saw the peaceful bison each day.

We've never brought our dog to an Abnb before and wondered if allowing dogs would impact the home's cleanliness, etc. Wow - super-clean... cleaner than some stays we've had where pets aren't allowed (no pet smells or anything like that). We stayed in and cooked most of our meals and found everything we needed and more. Seriously - this is Airbnb done right. We loved the view of the rolling hills and bison in the backyard - so neat to see the bison roaming in the snow. Stand outside at night and listen to what silence really is, such a peaceful place. Brighter stars than I've seen in a long time. Thanks so much for having us.

We enjoyed our stay and were fortunate enough to see the bison herd up-close from the backyard. Earl provided great communication and hospitality. The only improvable aspects (to nitpick) would be that the wifi is rather slow and that none of the clocks in the home seem to be working. Otherwise, the place was great and provided us a nice getaway."

The bison herd was on the other side of the road, but a few of the big boys hung around. I was treated to a wrestling match between a couple of the young males!! You could hear the clacking of their horns and some of their snorts!!! That same evening as the sun was just going down, a couple of deer moved into view. One little doe stuck around for a snack & then bedded down for a bit underneath a small pine tree. I sat & watched her for nearly 30 minutes....so quiet, so peaceful & a lovely place.

We found that, along with daily communing with the bison herd. We woke up Saturday morning, looked out the window and a small herd of bison were having their breakfast just on the other side of the fence - magical.
The house is much bigger than I thought it was going to be. The beds and couches are very comfy. The kitchen is huge and very well stocked - pretty much everything you would need - including a waffle iron and maple syrup!
There is so much to do in the area, lots of hiking and biking opportunities.
We had a fabulous weekend and hope to be back."

The WiFi router wasn’t there and microwave seemed broken and someone was there within an hour to address both issues (with a mask on!). The grill was awesome for steak night, and the kitchen was well outfitted with cook and eating ware - and fantastic spices.
One of the best perks was before we even arrived. Ample recommendations for food (which we didn’t use/need) and what to see and do. It was great! We enjoyed: Husar Memorial walk (down the road), Castle Rock overlook (saw bald eagles!), Nachusa grasslands (saw bison!) and did the Stone Barn Savanna walk twice.
I’d recommend this place to anyone - especially with older kids who would have a blast bunking in the upstairs loft. Look forward to staying again when we come back in the spring!"

There are a couple of concrete steps on the approach to the house and 9 steps up to the door which I don't recall on the listing. Erin was very quick to respond to my messages and seemed interested in my thoughts on her property. The sun porch needed a window repair and the entry door could use paint but overall it served our needs.

The area is very quiet and has an almost magical feel to it. I loved taking walks through the neighborhood with my dog and admiring the beautiful historic homes and lush gardens. The house was charming and simple, but provided what I needed for a peaceful getaway from the city. I enjoyed sitting outside and having coffee on the patio in the mornings while listening to the sounds of nature. I also appreciated the selection VHS movies to watch on the tv which provided a fun retro vibe. The neighbors were all very friendly, and everyone smiles and waves when they see you. If you're looking for a quiet and peaceful getaway, where you feel like you've taken a trip back to a simpler time, Erin's place is the perfect spot!"

Stayed a few nights","This is a very old house... as such there is an old house smell which to me was unappealing. The odor faded as I got used to it. Also, the exterior of the house, as you can see in the photos, has not been maintained. That said ... the inside is spacious and clean. I would not call the furnishings comfortable. There is no dresser in the downstairs bedroom or end tables, for example.Nothing that can't be worked around. All was adequate and useful to me for the purpose of my visit and a fair exchange for the rental fee.
The setting is lovely ... the neighborhood charming ... the location convenient to Rock River adventures. The host left a welcome book with restaurant suggestions. I visited two and the food was delicious.
Erin was responsive to me prior to the visit and sent me information so that I could pre-plan some of my day trips."

Stayed with kids","My family of 5 stayed here for a month. The box elder bugs were really bad from the moment we arrived. The hosts did what they can and were very responsive, but the outside of the house needs some major TLC. Until the windows are sealed, all the repellent in the world won’t keep the bugs from getting inside.
Aside from the bugs, the house is bright and welcoming, and clean otherwise. There was plenty of space for the 5 of us and had everything we needed for a long stay. The neighborhood is absolutely charming and there is a lot of space in the yard to play. It’s a short drive to Dixon. My husband works from home and had no issues with the internet. The hosts are helpful and did everything they can to make sure we enjoyed our stay. Even with the bugs (they are a spring time bug), I do recommend staying here. Grand Detour is such a peaceful area and the property is beautiful."

Stayed with kids","The location of this charming older home is perfect for peace, quiet, and a bit of history. Grand Detour has several historic houses and the number of large trees and the river just blocks away add to the ambience. The home's property is large and just blocks away from the John Deere museum. We loved walking the streets during our fall visit.
The downstairs bed was very comfortable and there were plenty of towels and blankets. The Wi-Fi worked very well during our stay and we didn't miss having cable T.V. since there was plenty to do during our visit.
Hubby and I live in a 150-year old home so we're used to the quirks of an older home. Erin's place has gorgeous wood floors downstairs with large windows throughout. The home could use a bit of maintenance. The exterior needs to be painted and the concrete at the bottom of the back steps is eroded and could prove to be dangerous for older folks or small children.
There are several parks in the area for hiking and exploring. Dixon is just a 5-minute drive and has the best coffee at Coffee Crush. Somkit, the Thai restaurant, was also very good and served the best sangria I've ever had. Hazel's in Oregon is also great for coffee and sandwiches. We also enjoyed dinner at the White Pines Lodge and had a seat right next to the fireplace.
I would stay here again. I'm a writer and this quiet retreat is perfect for a writer's retreat."

Stayed with kids","We were looking for a place to stay for a hiking weekend that included a visit to the Nachusa bison herd. This house was perfect: in the tiny town of Grand Detour, surrounded by a lovely, large yard (though not as large as the photos make it seem), and dog-friendly! This is clearly Grandma's old house--furnished with antiques, quilts and lace, and an ancient television. The kitchen is equipped for simple cooking (I spied a bread machine in the cupboard, so byo flour and yeast and you can have easy fresh-baked bread), and there's a Weber bbq outside, along with a fire pit and a horseshoes game area. Beds are comfy, wi-fi was OK. We brought a Roku stick and managed to find a USB port on the tv, so we could watch a movie. The hiking was lovely, especially at the Lowden-Miller state forest across the river. This is a great place to stay when you want to hike or bike or kayak...but you don't want to camp!"

The outside patio and grill was great! Plenty of room inside, both upstairs and down. Washer and dryer worked well. Heat and AC worked great too. Beds were comfortable and Kitchen was stocked decently. If I had to complain about anything, none of it really affected the stay. We didn't have a toaster. Bagel bummer, but the oven toasted fine. Internet was a little slow, but everything seems slow WHEN your home is gigabit fiber. The Japanese beetles were having their way with the ceilings and near windows, but EVERYWHERE around us showed no shortage of them either. And Ill take the beetles over skeeters any day! Lastly, It would have been nice to have a dresser in the downstairs bedroom, especially on an extended stay. Otherwise, all was good. Will return again!"

Stayed with kids","The home is simple and charming. We had everything we needed to make Thanksgiving dinner. The first floor bed is very comfortable. (We did not use the 2nd floor bedroom.) There’s lot of space to move around and have several activities going on at one time. There are stains on the carpets and farmhouse bugs but overall, the house was clean. The locks on the doors need to be updated and outdoor lighting is needed but with those additions, we would stay again.
The village is rich with history. It is filled with the cutest homes I’ve ever seen. A visit to the John Deere Historic site is a must! Grand Detour is a hidden gem!"

Although we utilize only one bedroom to sleep the upstairs had a meditation room that I thought was a very nice touch to Add onto the peacefulness you feel by staying in this home. The house has tons of character, and the owners are readily availableAnd prompt to answer questions. Thoughtful little touches all around the home for a nice little surprises as well. We found that by the end of the weekend the home had everything that we needed. I will definitely find myself passing through here again."

Stayed a few nights","Erin's house isn't perfect, but it is perfectly charming. If you are looking for a quiet getaway in a town that time forgot, Erin's place is it. We were looking for a place with good hiking and biking close to Chicago. We found that and more in Grand Detour.
My husband and I loved Erin's little farmhouse. First of all, Erin was very responsive to our needs. She and her neighbor Jeff are great hosts. There is a huge yard for the dogs to run in. The bed is very comfy, kitchen well stocked, and bathroom very clean. Nighttime in Grand Detour is silent - we slept like babies.
The town of Grand Detour was a huge surprise. It is tucked in a bend of the Rock River - you only had to walk a couple of blocks in either direction and you would be at the river's banks. It is home to John Deere's original house which is open to the public free of charge. It is also full of well preserved mid-19th-century homes which made for nice scenery on our evening strolls.
Nearby are the Nachusa Grasslands which is home to a wild buffalo herd - bring binoculars! There are numerous state parks for hiking, and the rolling country roads are perfect for long bike rides.
Erin's little farmhouse in Grand Detour was the perfect base for our explorations."

I recommend the yoga room highly. We built camp fires, grilled, walked by the river (a block away), and almost fell asleep in the Jacuzzi bathtub. This is wonderful place to kick your feet up, turn off the phone, and reconnect with nature and the star filled sky. Thank you to Erin for being such a great hostess. We had everything we needed and more!"

Group trip","We were in town for our parents memorial. They both passed away just a month earlier. We were really happy we could all be together in one place. It was big enough to visit with everyone and felt cozy at the same time. We really appreciated the well equipped kitchen and spacious area.
There was plenty to do with outgoing portable and games . The weather wasn’t good enough to enjoy the outdoors very much but would have been a lot of fun. Especially the large walk around deck, fire pit , and kids toys. A few things need to be picked up outside butmitmwas early in the season so I’m guessing that will get done. Appreciated the extra time for check out so we could enjoy a little more time together before ever headed to the airport. Thank you Jose for the hospitality and wonderful accommodations. We left some puzzles for future guests. They were my moms and we know she would like to have them used there."

The whole house was immaculate, kitchen big and contained everything we needed. We had food catering and with the commercial stove and oven we were able to heat food. The long wooden table with 26 chairs was perfect for our gathering. Children also had a good time playing outside, on the jumping trampoline and by the fire pit. The beds were comfortable. Jose was a great host always texting and ready to help. He was responsive to all my questions. We all had a wonderful experience and I would highly recommend this cabin to others."

Inside was very clean and spacious. Even though it was beautiful weather, our family kept lingering inside because there was so much to do. The pool table, ping pong, and air hockey were big hits. The amazing table had room for working a puzzle on one end, games in the middle, and still room for all of us to sit and eat. I was afraid with all those activities in one room the sound would be loud but we had no issues. Bedrooms were quiet as well. We also enjoyed the canoes, volleyball and fire pit outside. Very quiet and peaceful! Blessing to have family all together!"

While some reviewers said they wouldn't swim in the river, we canoed/kayaked across the river (very close by) to a more sandy area and the kids had a blast swimming.
Would definitely come here again!"

Stayed with kids","This was a great place for a larger group of people to be together but not be completely on top of each other.
We came for a long weekend with my family (15 total ppl) and were very impressed with the size of the property. If you like to get your steps great for that, there are grass paths that go back throughout the woods that the kids liked to explore on. The boat landing is~3-5 minute walk and the current wasn't difficult to paddle against. We were prepared for a lot of bugs and to be honest mosquitoes weren't an issue when we went, gnats were more noticeable. There is a lot of kindling for fires and the fire pit is nice right on the water, need your own wood.
Each family had their own bedroom and though the main room is right off of all the BRs, the sound was not an issue as I thought it might.
I 100% plan to come back.
Things I wish I'd known: No TV main room (each BR has one); there are pilot flames that constantly run on the range (dont set anything on), BYO TP/paper towel"

Best of all, the enormous common area has a comfy sitting area, huge family dining table, big kitchen, pool table, ping pong table, air hockey, foosball and pac man all in the same space so that the guests naturally gravitate to the same area which is really fun. There is plenty to do outside too - volley ball, a fire pit, a grill, wrap around deck and kayaks. Also, while secluded, the property is located close to downtown Dixon and convenience stores and pharmacies. The owner, Jose, is easy to contact and responsive. The check in process is super easy.

You are on a 10 min drive from supermarket but once on the property, feel like you are in the middle of nowhere - it’s great!

Group trip","What a wonderful home and host! The house was clean, pictures were completely accurate and there was tons to do. It slept 20 of us very comfortably. Well stocked kitchen to cook large meals in - we loved all the games that were placed about the common area. We enjoyed a beautiful fire in the fireplace on a chilly summer night. The host had wonderful communication with us and answered all my questions extremely promptly. While we were there, we looked at the home's calendar to see what was open for the Spring. We'll definitely come back!"

Jose was great as well, responded very quickly to any questions we had and very accommodating overall.
We will definitely be back sometime in the near future. Thanks so much, Jose!"

We would recommend you bring along washcloths and extra paper towels. Jose did a great job communicating with us."

Stayed with kids","Upon arrival we were even more surprised, the pictures are beautiful but in person WOW ! Warm, cozy, inviting with a rustic charm and all the amenities you could ask for, lots of space and comfort for all 16 of 3 generations. Our first airbnb experience and not our last, Jose was always available and checked on us daily. We are definitely putting this on a annual gathering. The location was perfect 1 1/2 hour away for all . We were on our own island and secluded with a beautiful view of the river yet anything we needed was 10 minutes or less away . We made lifetime memories. It was refreshing to have 4 teenagers without a phone in their hands and playing pool, ping pong, foosbal and the games provided, with their grandparents, aunts and uncles especially cherades., priceless . Thank you Jose there is not one thing that would require improvements, our compliments on the little touches. Thank you !!!!!"

Stayed with kids",The place was great and spacious. Our family had lots of fun. If you plan to travel with children be aware that there are steep stairs and no gate for the children. Also if you travel here in the winter be prepared to spend several hundreds of dollars in firewood. We kept the fire running nonstop during the day to get it up to about 72. The heating system cannot keep up with the cold Chicago nights. There is no heating upstairs so you have to keep the doors open for the heat to travel and even doing that it was pretty cold upstairs. Other than that the place was great and we had a great time.

We were visiting Dixon for a funeral, and even though it was a very sad time for our family, this place offered so much entertainment that we forgot we were even sad. It was so spacious, and the large 26 top dining table was perfect for us to host family from surrounding areas, and spend priceless quality time with each other. Anyone that came to visit was so impressed with the cabin decor and unique wood work. Jose, was quick to respond whenever I messaged him with any questions. We look forward to staying here again, when we visit next time for my grandma’s 90th birthday. I highly recommend this stunning cabin, if you are looking for gorgeous views, entertainment for the kids, enough space for everyone, and an enjoyable vacation to remember for a lifetime!"

The house is clean and well-appointed and comes with games and water craft. Ideal for a family vacation. Jose, our host, was extremely responsive and helpful. Great communicator. The 12 acres of flat grounds offer privacy and ease. The river is just a few steps away from its fabulous wrap-around deck. I would stay here again. Highly recommended. Note: Dixon has 8 brand new pickleball courts at Meadows Park. Enjoy."

I wish my trip was a lot longer so that I could stay there. The host, Josh, is super cool and friendly. He’s very helpful and communicative so that made everything such a smooth process!
I cannot wait to visit again. This place is highly Recommended by Me and don’t hesitate to book or you’ll miss out.
There are so much good to be said about the cabin but I rather let you go see and enjoy it. It is a safe community.
P.S: Buy some snacks and maybe grocery for when you get hungry at night. It’s a cabin, like come on now 😁😅."
