Stayed with a pet",Very nice place with a great host. Close to downtown Iron Mountain and all the restaurants. Great ice cream place almost across the street. Super close to alot of great hiking spots and DOG FRIENDLY!! Photos dont do it justice. Its a really nice place. Its not a cabin in the woods but if your in town to hangout for the weekend and want a nice place to relax at after your outings itll be hard to find a nicer one in the area.

Stayed with kids","This was a great place for my family, we have two little kids (ages 1 and 3) and it worked really well. The room set ups and layout of the house were great for us. We were able to walk downtown from there (it is about 1.5 miles, we like walking, but there weren’t a lot of sidewalks, but a really nice park that was close). And I thought the main bed was really comfortable with the memory foam and all the blankets. The weather wasn’t good to enjoy the backyard, but it looked nice. We would stay here again!"

Group trip","We very much enjoyed the home. It was exactly as it was shown/described on AirB&B. We took advantage of the awesome screened in porch which was peaceful and the view was very nice as you could see the wooded treeline behind the neighbors homes. The weather was gorgeous so we also enjoyed having our friends over and sat at the table under the tree and there were many chairs for everyone to use. He had the house stocked with every thing from coffee to Aveeno hand cream bottles, and even a load of firewood ready (but we did not use that)."

He said there was not but there was a rolled up mattress in the closet that could be used. When we arrived, he had purchased a brand new air mattress and had sheets out for it as well.
Anytime, I inquired, he responded immediately. His home was tastefully, decorated and updated with the latest appliances. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!"

Group trip","We had a wonderful stay in Kingsford. Brian’s house was charming! It was immaculate, well decorated and looked just like the pictures. The kitchen was extremely well stocked and had everything we needed. We loved having our coffee on the cozy front porch every morning and even had a chance to use the grill in the backyard. The three bedrooms upstairs had very comfortable beds. If you are planning on using the trundle bed, know that opening the door becomes a bit tricky but we made it work. We appreciated the mattress topper for that bed which made it more comfortable. Brian left very detailed instructions for how to use things around the house. We could not have been happier with our stay and look forward to staying again on our next trip to Iron Mountain."

Stayed with a pet",We could not have been happier with our stay at Brian's house. It's a beautiful home that is comfortable and had absolutely everything we needed. It made our mini family reunion perfect giving us space to all spend a few days together. Even our dog was welcomed into the home with a fresh bowl of water and a bowl for his food placed on a mat...a perfect touch for this dog mom. The back yard is wonderful and I thoroughly enjoyed spending time playing with our dog there. Brian was a joy to work with and we know that we will be choosing this home the next time we are visiting the Iron Mountain/Kingsford area!

Stayed with kids","The place overall was very cute but we weren't expecting the furnace system to be so inconsistent. It made the main living area very warm, but the bedrooms and bathrooms were FREEZING! No matter how high we set the heat. I wish we would have known this prior to visiting because we had a 9 month old staying with us and the rooms were just too cold to have them in a bedroom. I'm sure this is a very nice place for the summertime, but I would not recommend coming here if the weather is cold."

She provided more essentials then we knew we would need and we felt right at home. Not only was she super responsive when we had questions but went above and beyond to make sure we fully understood the answer (example - learning how to use a pellet wood stove). This was our first experience in an air bnb and we now know there’s no other way to go.

The kitchen was fully stocked - new pots & pans; full knives set; new coffee pot - much much better than most rentals. The WiFi was super fast and reliable. Both bedrooms had queen beds and having two full bathrooms was great for a party of 3. We used the washer and dryer and appreciated the available laundry soap. The host Mia was very responsive when we reached out with questions but we felt it also would have been helpful to have in instruction binder on property for things like how to use the pellet stove, how to use the wall heater controller, etc. Overall terrific property!"

The trees surrounding the cabin give it privacy but don’t block the view of the lake—sitting on the deck with a cup of coffee, looking out over the water, listening to the birds and watching the deer wander across the yard was something we looked forward to each morning. Even though the nights were cool,
the split unit that was installed this year made the cabin especially comfortable.
Ian is a very attentive host and answered questions right away which we very much appreciated. As always we give Spring Lake Cabin 5 stars in every category."

We look forward to our next trip there! - My sister in law loved it as much as we did!"

On one of the nights during our stay, we lost power for a few hours and Ian messaged me to check in, which I thought was very thoughtful and shows how truly wonderful of a host he is! 10/10 would definitely recommend :)"

Inside, the kids games were a hit and the kitchen was well equipped for us to cook breakfast and prepare other meals. The deck was a perfect place to enjoy coffee (host provided good local coffee) in the morning. The lake is beautiful! The fishing was great and the dogs enjoyed the water too. We loved the boats available and appreciated they had life jackets (including kids sizes). The kids spent hours just watching all the fish in the clear water. I also loved the location. It was a secluded quiet lake area but still a quick drive to town with plenty of stores and restaurants if we needed anything. The kids loved discovering all the wildlife- we saw a turtle, snake, bald eagle and deer. The hosts were fantastic. This has been one of our favorite dog friendly Airbnb rentals we’ve ever stayed in."

The cabin is tucked away enough to feel like you’re out in the woods while also being close enough to town to have everything you need in just a few minutes drive. Communication was exceptional and the cabin was super clean. Only note is that the internet wasn’t super strong and depending on your carrier, cell service can also be spotty (Verizon did fine, US Cellular struggled). Not a problem for us as we were there to unplug! We would love to return and stay at Ian’s cabin again!"

Downsides were the stairs going down to the cabin are very uneven and broken, you have to be very careful as you walk down. Same thing for the stairs going down to the lake. Also, neither beds were the most comfortable. We brought our 2 dogs (who like to shed) and did not have a vacuum accessible to vacuum the fur. We did have a broom, just not the same effect! Easy things to fix though! Overall, a great stay 🙂"

- The deck overlooking the lake and the lakeside.
- Watching the sunsets from the dock.
Not So Good Features:
- The synthetic chemical smell of the laundry detergent and febreeze.
- The floor is not leveled, including the bed. You will feel like you're on a rocking boat most of the time.
- When the temperature drops, the heaters might not be warm enough. Bring warm clothes and extra blankets.
- Bring slippers. The floor is not very clean.
- Neighbors are all around you. The small lake has lots of houses. Some like to party.
- Highway noise from the nearby roads."

Stayed with a pet","We booked our week stay at this gorgeous cozy cabin. You drive through the gorgeous UP to get to a really great little town that had everything you could need during your stay right up the highway. The cabin is nestled back in a quiet little neighborhood with great neighbors that are the perfect distance away, so you still have your privacy. We spent most of our time at the cabin honestly, because it was so peaceful. Usually we book airbnbs and we're out exploring 90% of the time lol. But Spring Lake was different. it evoked a calm that we needed to just be still, listen to the chipmunks and birds, close our eyes and feel the soft breeze from the Lake as we sat on the back deck. We brought our hammocks with the tree safe straps and just swung for hours. It was the PERFECT place. My husband said ""this is the most relaxing vacation we've ever taken"". The slower pace of the town and the kindness of the locals is unmatched. The hosts of this cabin were awesome and kind throughout the whole experience. 10 star experience all the way. So incredibly glad we lucked out and this booking was still available when I found it. and trust me when I say I probably looked at every listing in the UP. 😆 and Spring Lake was the number one pick out of every cabin. Don't keep looking through the other listings, you're wasting your time! THIS cabin is what you are looking for!! Book it now!! It has the canoe, paddle boat, canoes, grill, big back porch, mature trees all around, gorgeous flowers, perfect view of the lake- the branches even camouflage the other houses across the Lake haha. win win!!! We will definitely be booking here again in the future. this is a place you will want to return to. Absolutely in love with it and returned home feeling refreshed and happier. Thank you guys for sharing your home with others. Much appreciated!!!!"

Stayed a few nights","Ian's cabin is a wonderful, peaceful retreat. Communication was great throughout the whole process, and the space was just as lovely as pictured. Ian and Melanie have outfitted the cabin so thoughtfully for guests - both inside and out. Lots of nice extras, such as local coffees, extra kitchen supplies, nice soaps, books, toys for kids, life jackets - even dog treats! It's easy to enjoy time outside on the deck, by the shore, or on the lake in the kayak, peddle boat, or row boat which are provided. The lake was so pretty and quiet, with just a few other homes around it. Fun to watch water birds coming and going and hear the occasional fish jump. The town of Iron Mountain is a quick trip away for groceries, ice cream, and restaurants. Another review mentioned Tadych's grocery. I found everything I needed there, and also enjoyed visiting The Bakery Shoppe and Crispigna's Italian Market! There are many hiking trails and other outdoor recreation within a short distance of the cabin. Thank you for providing such a perfect home away from home, Ian and Melanie. I hope to return!"

Stayed about a week","We had a wonderful week at the cabin. The listing is very accurate but it’s even cuter/larger in person. It’s well decorated, well stocked, super clean and very rustic cozy. It’s an incredibly peaceful and relaxing place and it was great to just sit outside and look at the lake and listen to the frogs. Outside there’s a fire pit, rowboat, kayaks, paddleboat, and a dock. However, the sliding glass doors provide a great view even if you’d rather be inside. There are two ceiling fans inside and miraculously the space stays comfortable even when it is warm outside. They have provided anything you could need, but if you have questions, Ian is a great communicator and responds promptly. We would absolutely recommend the cabin and would love to return next time we’re in the area."

Stayed with kids","Such a perfect little spot for a quiet, outdoorsie type of long weekend or week!
My wife and I and our two boys (13 and 8) really enjoyed this spot. As just enough space and amenities - simple and sweet, but not overdone. Perfect spot for fishing, kayaking, paddleboating, making smores over the fire pit. It slept the 4 of us perfectly... could likely squeeze in one more on the pull out couch, but 4 is just right for the space.
We were only there for 2 full days, so had one day at the cabin/lake and went on a hike to LaSalle Falls, which was beautiful.
There's no wifi, which was fine for us, but probably important to mention for those of you it's important for.
Really loved our stay and will keep it on our list for future weekends!"

The outdoors were really nice with a fire pit, fire wood, kayaks, paddleboat, and a dock to sit and hang your feet in the water. Iron Mountain is a cute town with lots of scenery. Check out Hydraulic Falls, Fumee Natural Area, then enjoy the views from Pine Mountain and Millie Hill. Good pizza at Brickoven Pizzeria and Tadyck's had all of our grocery needs. Bigfoot Liquor on US 2 was great for drinks and pasties. Further away Piers Gorge is a must see, and don't forget to fill your water bottles up at the Norway spring.

We loved having coffee on the deck in the morning to the gorgeous view of the lake and the reflection of the trees on it and relaxing to a fire at night. The water is so clear that you can spend lots of time on the dock just watching the fish go about life. I love swimming and my partner loves kayaking so it was the perfect place for us!

Stayed a few nights",It’s a great little cabin on a beautiful secluded lake. Owners are really great and are nearby if you need anything. Beds were very comfortable and they have direct tv so my dad could watch the golf channel. We had a really great time grilling out and drinking wine on the porch on such a beautiful lake

We also enjoyed a lot of hikes the area has to offer around area rapids and falls, local lakes and kayaking and paddle boating around Silver Lake. If you like lakes undisturbed by motor boats and jet skis, this place is ideal! We also loved watching the stars while sitting in front of an evening bonfire! There were nice touches, like having plenty of basic things we might need available such as soap, toilet paper, paper towels and even q-tips! The queen bed was quite a bit comfier that many other places we’ve stayed. Overall, if you are looking for a relaxing place to get away from it all, Ian’s is just the place!"

Very little boat traffic and no public access. Cabin is about 10 minutes from town - enough to feel secluded but close enough for any necessities you may need. The town of Iron Mountain will have anything you need for your stay (groceries, etc.). There were very few bugs there in mid July. We hardly wore insect repellent.
Ian & Melanie are welcoming and thoughtful hosts. Their cabin is next door, and you may get to visit with them if they are there for the weekend."

We selected this home since it was near our white water rafting adventure at The True North Outpost. It ended up being the perfect pairing!

The cabin was peaceful, well stocked with essentials and the lake view was spectacular with the fall colors. The temperature did drop which can make the cabin quite chilly quite quickly, however it is nothing the fireplace or heater can’t fix. Small touches like the local fresh coffee on offer and private fire pit/kayaks is a perfect way to make the trip special. We would definitely stay here again if in the area."

Stayed a few nights","This home has quite a few pictures of their family. It definitely was uniquely placed. Definitely shows their family is cherished. It gives a cozy feeling. This family is definitely a family that supports Trump. So, for those who are not Trump supporters it could be an uncomfortable experience. This family also values the Christian lifestyle so they have a Christian theme throughout the home. This could make some people uncomfortable too. But, if you can go beyond that it is nice.
The stairs to the basement are a bit steeper. Going down is easier than up.

I woke up to a couple of six point bucks in the back yard. Beautiful view of the lake and the north bank. I used the grill on the deck every day. The kitchen was super easy to use and had everything you need. (I also unfortunately brought work with me and the kitchen counter worked great as a desk allowing me to lay out all my papers!) The indoor 2 person sauna is great! Old collection of LP's was fun going through. (Played ""IN A GADDA DA VIDA"" by Iron Butterfly.) Get to park in the garage. Loved the vaulted ceilings and the beautiful window lighting!!! There is more I could put down but this is a great find. Thank you Barb & Ray (& Emilie) for letting us into your home. Blessed."

I didn’t mind the family pictures (there are MANY but it was fun to see such a sweet family), or their religious items (although some were oddly placed to make them hard to avoid). They were very upfront about both of these things. I did feel that the placement of political materials was not necessary. The items were not just on a bookshelf or on a coffee table. They were placed in locations that made it impossible not to interact with them. I felt that was a bit too pushy (regardless of my political taste). Other than that, I would recommend this location.

Stayed a few nights","The house is conveniently located in iron Mountain, however I felt unsecured, unsafe and the amount of religious and political items, in the house made me extremely uncomfortable. There are large windows in the house however, there are few window coverings, being in an unfamiliar area it was a bit haunting knowing everyone could look in the windows and see you at all times. This was uncomfortable especially after dark. The family would come and go from the home, however, the host did give you a heads up that ‘someone would be coming over at some time’. There was leftover food, soiled foil and baggies left in the drawers in the kitchen. There was alcohol and food left in the refrigerator. For the most part the house appeared clean. I would not stay there again. I would not recommend this rental at all."

We also really appreciated the welcome note on the kitchen counter giving little tidbits about the house. Very helpful and informative.
Easy check-in and very secure.

Scenery during peak fall is absolutely amazing. Place was very clean. Nice recommendations from the owners of things to do and places to eat. Sauna was amazing and definitely needed!
If I have to knock it of anything it's bed is pretty hard, but different people require different beds.
The stairs are a bit on the tall side for my wife's little legs.
Hosts are very communicative if needed. Will definitely book again if we stay in the area.
We saw deer in the back yard daily."

Stayed one night",I was very upfront and honest that I was booking this for two employees of mine. Was very communicative with the host and provided all the requested information including photo ids of both guests. Host threw a tantrum because I didn’t know the exact time they would arrive and canceled our reservation without much notice before our stay. I was very kind prior to her canceling our stay but she was extremely rude and disrespectful. Would not recommend booking with her at all

Their were family pictures everywhere as well as political and EXTREME religious things around the house. If that bothers you don’t stay here!!! Other than that their is a small sauna in the basement. Works well. The stairs are a bit sketchy but I’ve brought it up to the host so I’m hopeful they will be fixed.

Stayed a few nights","This was the first time I have rented with Airbnb.
Barb and Ray's daughter helped make check-in and our visit go smoothly.
Garage parking and heated flooring were each a bonus.
Try relaxing in their modern, corner-unit sauna; very therapeutic.
We saw lots of deer and birds through large, attractive windows in the upstairs living room. The house and amenities are dated, yet well-kept, and mostly clean.
It is spacious, despite two of the rooms being locked. We were traveling as only a couple of humans, so the modest bed in the basement was serviceable enough. The high ceilings and sky light in the kitchen made the outdoors feel closer.
The hosts left a cheerful note about the house and area. Clean towels and thoughtful toiletries were a kind and welcoming gesture, although silly us: we traveled with our own. O:)
In stride with the helpfulness of our hosts, it was admittedly challenging to try to see past-- and relax amongst-- the dozens of prominently placed family photos, religious affects, and political displays. Given being in the beautiful UP was the main goal of our visit, I did my best to content myself with the views from windows instead. It was the first time I wished a place seemed more like a hotel in a way, as I had arrived with the understanding personal effects are meant to be kept to a minimum. I felt a little embarrassed that I had not at least had coffee with the family before seeing so much of their personal life.
If you rent this spot, take comfort in this:
I suppose the family photos, and political and religious displays would be put away if the hosts felt embarrassed about them. 😇 Different strokes, different folks: maybe you won't mind what was distracting to me.
Distracting kitsch aside, the house is overall nice.
Thank you again, Barb and Ray!"

This is their home, as mentioned in the description (personal items that are religious and political in nature), nothing wrong with this of course, but just something to reiterate for future guests.
Thanks for the great stay. Glad we made the trip."

Parked in the garage, then entered the house and had a jaw dropping moment as we stood in awe of their true north facing windows which are floor to ceiling. Watching a herd of deer browsing the forest outside, we felt calm and ""at home"". It was heartwarming that this family is genuinely proud of their family, God and country.
A spacious kitchen with all the amenities, large dining room, 2 bathrooms. About 10 steps down to the lower level sleeping area and there is a comfy home theater. There are normal house noises (fridge, furnace, etc) but otherwise you could hear a pin drop. Lots of places in town to eat, shop and skiing Pine Mountain was a hoot. We hope to return again!"

Keeping in mind that they are using their personal home as a business operation, we found the family photos, and religious and political memorabilia distracting. They overshadowed the whole experience. We heard noises throughout the day/night that were also distracting. Be aware of the stairs. Although it is covered with a rug, it’s really slippery.
If there weren’t the issues we previously stated, this easily could’ve been a five star review."

There was even a shovel in an obvious place so we could clear the patio and driveway, which was very nice because it did snow quite a bit while we were there. Just one note: If you are uncomfortable being in a space that is clearly ""lived in"" this one may not be for you. Though clean, the family whose house this is clearly feels very strongly about certain things, and they want you to know it. That was more than a bit uncomfortable."

Overall, a lovely home, and worked very well for our needs.
Only thing I would mention is if you are someone who would not feel comfortable being surrounded with religious decor, this may not be your ideal choice. Also some expressions of political beliefs were placed in the home. This was not a deal breaker for my group, as it’s quite clear this is their home and not a rental.
All in all, we had an amazing experience in a beautiful home, and appreciated the communication and accommodations given :)"

As everyone else has stated, the views from the living room are spectacular and we just loved looking out at the foliage and Lake Antoine. It is their home and there were many personal touches, expressing their personalities and religious views but that was fine. If you want a neutral ""hotel"" environment, this is not the place for you to stay. We appreciated the ability to make breakfasts and sometimes other meals and have the appropriate cooking utensils available (baking sheet, measuring cups etc).

The only thing I should warn travelers before staying in their house is the amount of Bible quotes all over the walls, the pro Trump symbols, and the conservative phrases in every corner of the house, this may be a bit uncomfortable for Airbnb travelers with different ideologies."

The home is close to restaurants and shops but far enough away from the town to get lost in the view of the mountains and lake below. HUGE bang for the buck. 5 stars!"

I absolutely loved that Ray and Barb’s family pictures were out. I felt like I was staying with friends. The in-floor heat was very cozy and comfortable. The far infrared sauna was quite a treat too! Everything was very clean and there were no chemical scents in the house, which was great for me. The house is in a very nice and safe neighborhood. Thank you Ray, Barb and Emelie!"

Stayed one night","The views from this home are lovely! We were pleased to find a few water bottles and beer left in the fridge. We took advantage of the spacious well stocked kitchen and made cinnamon rolls one morning while enjoying the views. Later we sipped coffee on the porch in the chilly breeze. Lake Antoine is quite lovely, even when frozen over! Emelie was a wonderful host and offered many tips on the area. Going off the beaten path to explore is highly recommended as you really get a feel for what Iron Mountain is really all about. The kids had a great time—the room set up for the kids was so sweet—unfortunately there was some exposed insulation, so, we put the mattresses in the living room space and the kids had the best time “camping”. They could have also easily slept on the two cushy couches. The record player, piano, and lights really added a special touch to the downstairs sleeping space. I personally LOVED the infrared sauna and took full advantage of it for detoxing and relaxation. What an absolute treat! Overall, we absolutely loved our stay and the kids keep begging to go back. ❤️"

Stayed a few nights","A year into the work/school/live-from-home life, we finally took a ""work-cation"" to change up the daily pandemic grind. This was the PERFECT space for us. The huge windows in the living room and breathtaking views from *everywhere* in the house allowed us to find some rest and relaxation while also keeping up with work/school. The internet was fast enough for both of us to have virtual meetings simultaneously, each of us could work in separate areas (one upstairs, one downstairs), and there was plenty of space for us to spread out and work comfortably (a welcome change from small urban apartments!).
The sauna nearly convinced us to buy one (but first we need to buy a house--ha!) and gave us a chance to really unplug and unwind each day. The house was very clean and comfortable, the garage kept our car out of the snow, and the keypad entry was straightforward (pro tip: do not lock the door between the garage and the house--you might forget it's locked at some point!). Ray and Barb's daughter, Emelie, was also a fantastic, helpful contact/co-host. All this--plus the adorable town of Iron Mountain and fun activities in the area--made for the best work-cation we could have asked for."

This is a nice place to stay and a great value!"

We brought our own, but the kitchen and bathroom were well stocked. We found games and magazines, extra throws, and fresh flowers in the living room area. Coffee maker, Keurig, and French press in kitchen. Fresh muffins were in the kitchen when we arrived with a welcome note. Clear instructions left for check out in a booklet, as well as local restaurants and places to visit in area. We were in town visiting family so we did not spend a lot of time in the house other than at night. If we had spent more time at the house, we would have used the little screened in porch with outdoor furniture and the gas grill outside garage area. We brought my 83 year old mom with us so that she could have her own bedroom and didn't have to get up as early as we do. She absolutely loved it and thought it was such a better option than a hotel! Would rent again.😊"

Her home was nicely decorated and with all the amenities she stated. It was a great kitchen to cook in along with all the utensils. Lisa our host went above and beyond by having teas available and extras for coffee. There were also two very yummy muffins waiting to be eaten! The bathroom, kitchen and all the rooms were spotless! I have stayed at many places and this was the cleanest and nicest place I have stayed so far. I absolutely will be back!
Thank you Lisa! Your were the best!

Stayed a few nights","This is a nice, cozy home - well-maintained inside and out, very clean and comfortable. Lisa is a wonderful, responsive host who went above and beyond in thoughtfully stocking the house. It's perhaps the best stocked airbnb we've stayed in. The homemade muffins, wine and coffee bar are a really nice touch -delicious too! The house is well-located. In addition to there being an ice cream stand across the street in each direction, it is also central to town and Lake Antoine, walkable to good restaurants (try Spud's for pizza), pickle ball courts, and Crispigna's Market (try the porketta sandwiches and bring home some frozen pizza). Another thing of note is that this house is air conditioned which was a needed amenity the week we were there. Highly recommend and hope to be back."

The home is located close to all downtown stores, restaurants and events. We were welcomed with muffins, a bottle of wine and a coffee/espresso/hot chocolate bar. It was a snowy weekend and every time we returned to the home the driveway, sidewalk and steps were shoveled. I was impressed and appreciated that! The home is cozy, immaculate and well decorated...I especially admired the architectural wooden arches. The entire home appears to be updated and the kitchen had everything needed to cook. We hope to visit again soon!
Thanks for everything, Lisa.

Stayed a few nights","We really enjoyed our time in Iron Mountain! Nice place, perfect sized for our little 3 person family. Appreciated the cleanliness, toiletries, plushy towels and quality beds. Only issues were the lack of curtains in the bedrooms and noisy floors/doors. There were only mini blinds in the bedrooms, which meant it was bright as day by 5 AM. Floors are super creaky and door knobs are loud as well, which meant once one person was awake in the morning, everyone was awake. We wish we had brought more fans to drown out the noise. Other than that, it was a great place to stay! We loved how close it was to 141, restaurants, waterfalls and hiking trails. We had Antonio's Pizza and it was pretty good. We loved the trail by Millie Mine and tried to see bats at night but didn't find any. Maybe next time!"

Stayed a few nights",The immense amount of thought that Lisa has put into this space is clear the second you open the door. We found extra special touches in every corner of every room...the coffee bar offered every imaginable option...extra towels for the bath...everything a cook could want for a short or long-term stay in the kitchen. Her design style is on point...but does not sacrifice comfort. Other than our own...the king-sized bed in the Michigan Room is the most comfortable we've ever slept on. If Lisa's space in Iron Mountain is available...grab this opportunity!

Decorated so nicely and so many thoughtful touches including the delicious muffins. We enjoyed chatting with Lisa on our first day there. Sat outside on the nice table to eat most meals. Don't miss the white water rafting in nearby Norway and our son loved the Timber Crest golf course. Did not want to leave! If we come back we will for sure stay here again!"

The bed was comfortable with amazing sheets and pillows. I slept better than I do at home and that never happens on vacation. Lisa was an excellent host. We enjoyed her company and her insight on the iron mountain area."

Local attractions and highlights were on her Airbnb website and also available in hardcopy once you arrived. You will know just where to get good Mexican food close by if that is what you are looking for. You will lie down in crisp, clean cotton sheets after a shower in an impeccably clean bathroom appointed with large colorful bath towels, hand towels, and washcloths. Be sure to notice that this is a newly remodeled home with newly refinished real wood floors offering air conditioning. The kitchen is appointed with KraftMaid cabinets with quiet close drawers and doors. This kitchen is equipped with more dishes and amenities than I have in my kitchen at home. One could comfortable cook for a family of 4-6 people. And there is overflow seating just outside the door on the patio. We were in the area to hike the many falls of Marinette County and we were not disappointed by the beauty of the area."

There was a snow storm during our stay that dumped a foot of snow and Lisa was outside many times shoveling and snow-blowing the driveway/walkway making sure it was cleared. Overall a beautiful home and I will most definitely be back!

Stayed a few nights","Our long weekend at the Loon Cottage provided all of the peace and quiet and solitude that we needed. The property was extremely clean and tidy and we had everything we needed and more. We spent our mornings drinking coffee and watching the river from giant windows in the living room. We also had a nice night on the dock under a full moon, lazily watching the river and waiting for a few swans to fly by. The cottage is a quick drive away from town where you can grab coffee and groceries, and also is within an easy drive of numerous parks and trails. We will be back!"

The bed was ridiculously soft and comfortable, it seemed like a memory foam mattress with a 4” foam topper so the bed hugs you. The bedroom was super dark and it made for excellent sleep. I wish I could have stayed a week to explore more and if I’m ever in the area, I’ll be looking to see if this place is available again."

There were extra amenities that were really nice to have and made me feel really welcome. The only thing I noticed wasn’t there (and to be fair I didn’t ask about) was a hairdryer, though I’m sure they would have helped get me one had I asked. I know other airbnb hosts have issues with those being stolen so I understand it not being there. Definitely a great place to stay and explore!"

We were able to cook what we wanted which made it so much better than going out all the time. The only word of caution I have, the bed is very low to the ground, so for someone with hip problems it was a little hard to get out of. But the bed itself was very comfortable. I would definitely recommend this property and will stay there again! Thanks Kate!"
