Stayed one night","This is one of the first Airbnbs I have stayed in that was actually better than the pictures! The space was beautiful. Everything was squeaky clean and the bed was so cozy.
The neighborhood was very walkable and the apartment was close to a ton of cafes, restaurants, and stores. There was ample street parking nearby.
Overall, staying here was a very zen, clean, and cozy experience."

Stayed one night","The place was awesome- looked just like the photos, fully stocked with everything you’d need for a little getaway. Tons of extra towels and linens which is always appreciated. The location was fantastic- walking distance to everything in Hudson! Such a cute town. One thing to note- the place sleeps 3 people, not 4 like it lists. There is a bed (sleeps 2) and a couch (sleeps 1- does not pull out) so keep in mind when booking. Additionally, there was zero flexibility in terms of early check in/late check out. We stayed one night and were hoping the place could accommodate our bags while we walked around/before we caught our Amtrak back to the city. Since they would not do it, we ended up paying $25/hour for the convenience. I’ve never heard of anything like this and was honestly pretty annoyed they wouldn’t work with us without charging us extra. All in all it was a nice experience and a good place- just keep in mind when booking!"

Stayed one night","Beautiful apartment, a block off Warren Street. There was a small ant problem in the bedroom and en-suite but the host was very responsive. Since we were only there one night there wasn’t too much time to remedy the situation but he did offer us a credit which was much appreciated. Otherwise the apartment was very clean with nice linens, fresh towels and robes. He was sending for ant traps so I’m sure that issue will be taken care of. I would stay here again despite the ant hiccup."

In hot weather (upper 90s when we were visiting) the central air conditioning comes to the rescue. Communication with Andrew was very quick and smooth."

The space was incredibly clean, had thoughtful amenities (like coffee which I always really appreciate!), and very easy check-in and check-out procedures. Andrew provides great instructions and ideas for nearby spots to check-out. I might suggest bringing a white noise machine to buffer some normal noise from the neighbors upstairs (nothing bad just normal family sounds - but it was pretty noticeable). Overall, highly recommend - we would definitely come back and hope to soon!"

It was located just one block from the main street in Hudson so it was very convenient to walk around. While there was plenty of street parking in front of the building, be aware of the odd parking regulations. Andrew does a good job of explaining it in the AirBnB listing but we neglected to read it a got a (inexpensive) parking ticket the first night. Aside from our own parking failures, it was a great stay and wonderful weekend in Hudson."

This lovely apartment is a short walk from shops and restaurants.
The only downside is the people living above you and noise that their daily living produces. At this writing, sound proofing between floors is something Andrew is intending to remedy."

The checkin and checkout process was seamless and quick! The host and his partner was very on top of the details, quick to respond and very accommodating. The place was immaculately cleaned and exactly what you expect from the pictures, if not even better in person. I was surprised at how much bigger it was in person! The price was very good compared to hotels in the area the same weekend. Definitely worth it!
The not so good stuff -
I didn’t love the location which felt to me like a bit of sketchy area and this apartment is on the ground floor. I don’t know much about Hudson NY but explore that a bit before booking. There was a loud disturbance outside of the home at night that was unsettling but it could have been just a case of bad luck. One other thing, on the second day in the morning, I could hear everything from the upstairs apartment from the bedroom like steps, movement, etc. It wasn’t an issue and was faint, but worth mentioning."

The location was perfect, as described, it, was a few blocks from Warren St. This made it an easy walk without putting us right there where it would have been less private and possibly noisier.
We thought the bed was very comfortable, and the place was welcoming and homey. The first night we stayed there were some guests above us who had a small child. Because this is an older home of frame construction, and not a newer steel and concrete building, we could hear him running above us. This was only an issue in the early morning of the first day. Despite that, I would stay there again."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I were traveling for a conference I was running in Hudson at the Hudson Hall. The location of Claudia's place is perfect. Just a few blocks and you're on Warren street. We were super comfortable during our stay. We felt right at home. The kitchen has everything you need, there is a nice large table where my husband and I could spread out and work. Separate living space to chill and chat or catch up on some news. The backyard is so cute and quaint. We felt safe. It was a great home base for our stay in Hudson.
I had a few questions and Claudia is responsive, quite funny, and I believe we'd be friends if I lived nearby!
We've stayed in a lot of Airbnbs and Claudia's place is in the top of the list. Sorry Claudia, you're beaten by a Glamping experience in Colorado which is not really apples to apples.
Thank you for sharing your amazing place with us!!

Hudson itself is a delightful town with so much character and history. I loved strolling through the streets, admiring the beautiful architecture, and experiencing the local culture. The food scene in Hudson is beyond impressive – the diverse restaurants offered a wide range of delicious cuisines, and I couldn't get enough of the delectable dishes.
Overall, my stay in Hudson was an unforgettable experience, and I can't wait to return to this lovely town and the Airbnb that made it even more special. Highly recommended!"

Claudia is very communicative which helped address a couple of questions we had prior to and upon arrival. The only big disappointment for us was that we had expected a king size bed as described under “the Space” on the site. Turns out, it is a Queen which was mentioned somewhere else on the site’s description of “where you’ll sleep”. Otherwise, everything is as described. We appreciated that lots of cable network options were available on the TV."

The only con is that the walls are pretty thin and you can hear the floors creaking from the upstairs neighbor so it was a bit hard to fall asleep with the noise.
Otherwise, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Claudia’s!"

The Maker Lounge was a newly added stop this trip, but equally enjoyable was an impromptu pizza (Boba Louie’s) picnic in Claudia’s charming garden.
Sheets and towels, as well as rooms, are pristine. At your fingertips is a well-appointed kitchen down to the coffee press. Books and paintings enhance cleverly crafted interiors designed to fill the senses—everything needed to be transported “upstate.” ❤️"

I had a bad cold and bed-ridden and Explained this to her and asked her to change it to 72 degrees for me, she begrudgingly did for a few hours saying that I would “roast” the neighbors upstairs and downstairs. However at night it went back to 62 degrees and I barely slept and got even sicker. She defended the fact that the thermostat is locked with a pin and set at 62, in the dead of winter (was 28 degrees outside)."

Stayed a few nights","Claudia's place is extremely welcoming and comfortable! It served as the perfect location to relax, recharge and reconnect.
The apartment is on the main level of an older house. From the street, there are about 10 steps up to the entrance. From the back door it can be accessed on ground level. There is a nice yard and designated parking spot behind the house, which unfortunately was occupied during my visit so I parked on State St. Alternate side parking is enforced but I could find no indication as to when one must move the car. (Does everyone rush out at midnight? Is there a window?) Despite fair warning I got a $15 ticket...my fault.
The apartment has 3 spacious rooms, a kitchen, and small bathroom with shower/tub. It was nice to be able to heat up some food we brought and assemble light meals. The kitchen had all the necessary utensils and items, including a fridge and gas stove. No microwave however.
The bedroom is quiet - it faces the back - and the large bed is very comfy. I slept well there! Note, there is nowhere to hang up any clothing but there are chairs and a long bench in the bedroom to lay out folded items.
Visitors should be aware that the house and neighborhood are quite old. The floorboards are creaky; here and there are even some gaps. Someone lives in the flat below so please be considerate, keep tv and voices low. Slippers are recommended due to the old floors. The house is also kept fairly cool so do bring a sweater if visiting in winter.
This is the nicest house on the block; others range from decent to fairly ramshackle. However, the neighborhood seems safe. Do not expect to see the stately brick mansions of Warren St., but if you are looking for comfortable, clean lodgings you will be delighted with Claudia's apartment. Most importantly, she was always available to answer any questions promptly throughout my stay (though out of town herself) and all her communication was extremely cordial.
I could not have had a nicer experience and recommend this location wholeheartedly!"

Stayed a few nights","Claudia communicated well and clearly; on our check in and check out was in easy touch with us allowing us to check in a bit early. The one-bedroom apartment is clean, spacious, secure, very comfortable bed, good AC, great hot water, very quiet to sleep there, cozy sweet backyard, well equipped kitchen. It is a 10-15 minute walk to the train station and the Basilica, and a 5 minute walk to Warren Street--a street of some long blocks of restaurants, antique stores, and clothing stores. Do know that Hudson is making a comeback and, if you are needing this, is not fully gentrified. This property is clearly attended to and highly maintained. But the location of this house--like much of the little town-- is mixed with homes that are not kept up. But don't let that deter you. We walked late at night around the town comfortably. We recommend this listing highly."

So quaint, comfortable and charming.
Really central and just a short walk to Warren St and all the stores.
Nice and quiet at night with parking in the back.
Not to mention a beautiful and serene garden to relaxing in the back.
Claudia was really helpful and generous with our questions.
It was a perfect AirBnB experience and we'll be back!"

The apartment looked like the pictures posted and the living room got upgraded with a nice large dining room table. The modern shower head was a nice surprise as I didn't know what to expect of the bathroom since there weren't any pictures. Claudia was very quick to respond to texts and any questions we had during our stay there. She sent a PDF with restaurant suggestions/places to go before our trip which was helpful. Check-in and check-out was smooth and easy :).

We only had one question the entire time which was how to find the parking (which I could have avoided completely had I read the checkin email she sent ahead of time) but Claudia promptly answered and talked us through it and we were set from there!

We lucked out and got perfect weather for the weekend so we were able to walk to Warren street and enjoy delicious meals at Hudson Food Studio, Swoon and Crimson Sparrow, cocktails at Fish and Game and coffee at Moto. Great shopping to be had on Warren St. as well including at the cute new boutique Collective 23."

Offstreet parking was also a bonus for us, we used claudia's place as a home base, taking the train into the city for a few days. The location , is just fine. State street is more busy than Warren, But the bedroom is in the back and we heard very little noise. The kingsize bed is amazing. I was super comfortable and slept well. For getting to Warren,There is a new cut through down the street that takes you there in a couple of minutes. We would definitely stay there again."

It had a lot of character and was well supplied with all the accoutrements of home. The bed is astoundingly comfortable - better than ours at home. Claudia is a great host - communicative, flexible, friendly and helpful. It is very, very close to central Hudson, though on the slightly dodgier end of town - which is actually the part gentrifying the most right now. The house is up a steep flight of stairs, something to keep in mind for guests for whom that will be a challenge."

Stayed a few nights","Exactly what you hope for from an airbnb stay! the listing is accurate and the host is welcoming and responsive. Information on the directions, parking, keys, etc all arrived in a timely manner. We arrived after dark, and not only did she leave the light on for us, but the heat was on, so the apartment felt very welcoming after a long drive. An email arrived not too long after we did, checking to make sure that everything was in order.

The apartment is very homey, and a nice size for the 3 of us- cosy, but plenty of room to spread out. The furnishings are eclectic- the overall feel is a bit early attic (in a good way). Lots of interesting bits and pieces, but not cluttered. The current table and chairs in the dining room are different (and I think nicer) than the white set in current picture.

We did have one small problem with the stove, and it was fixed within an hour. Location is very handy- a short walk to the main drag in Hudson. We would definitely stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","My sister and I stayed here mid-week, so we didn't get to meet Claudia. However, she was very responsive to emails and texts. She even texted me to check in on how we were doing during our 2-night stay.

We were pleased to find an affordable, pet-friendly option that was walking distance from town. Like the rest of the reviews, we found the apartment to be clean and comfortable, with convenient parking.

The house is a standout on the block -- the rest of the places on this street seemed quite run-down. While we never felt unsafe, it was a bit of a surprise relative to the luxury of Warren Street.

The bathroom, while clean, is quite small.

One thing to note about Hudson that was not specific to this apartment: the town is mostly closed Tues-Thurs. We found most of the stores and restaurants were not open during the days we were there. I'm sure it is much more lively on the weekends."

Apartment # 2 on the main floor is spacious and well-appointed. We were very grateful for the small touches such as coffee in the cupboard to help us jumpstart the day with a toddler.
Claudia was, without reservation, the best host. She was not intrusive, left us detailed and easy-to-follow instructions, and plenty of recommendations. She also allowed us to stay all day on the check-out day when she found that the housekeeper is not coming until next day.
I highly recommend Claudia's property for vacationing in Hudson."

The neighborhood borders a pretty run-down area. As Claudia warned us Hudson is ""in transition."" That was a bit of shock at first but I always felt safe and we walked all over. The main drag is the opposite pretty much, full of opulent businesses and fine restaurants.

We had really excellent dinner at Swoon Kitchenbar, brunch at Cafe Le Perche, coffee at Rev, and lunch at Baba Louie's.

Claudia contacted us a few days prior to our stay with all the information we needed and once we arrived there was a welcome book with information on Hudson, the house information (internet code/TV info, etc) and reccomendations for restaurants and activities. I have never done a booking on Airbnb before and was a bit nervous. I have to say- the pictures do not lie! The house is spacious and beautifully appointed with rustic repurposed furniture. The bedroom is so large with lots of closet space, and some nice benches to put your luggage. Claudia left coffee, milk, eggs in the fridge for breakfast and there is full cooking equipment, plates, glasses, etc and spices if you want to pick up groceries and enjoy a meal in.
It is such a nice place to stay- we brought our infant son and dog and it was much nicer than staying in a hotel. The location is great- just two blocks from Warren street where many restaurants, bars, and shops are. I am looking forward to coming back and renting the upstairs unit as well and bringing more people."

Hudson is quiet, but with a real community, very scenic. Great for escaping the constant bang-bang of NYC. We stayed 4 nights. Easy access by Amtrak. Great bars and restaurants; we went to Daba, (pm), and Half-moon, and recommend all--especially (pm) and Half-moon.

While it is a little off-putting to stay on a street with so many abandoned homes, everyone in town assured us that Hudson is quite safe, and we didn't experience any problems.
Claudia is a great hostess, and responded immediately to all my emails!"

Stayed a few nights","Amazing apartment for a wedding in Catleton-on-Hudson. I stayed for a weekend with my girlfriend, and couldn't have asked for a better place.

When we approached, we thought we may have gotten lost, because the neighborhood is very downtrodden, with lots of boarded up windows and evicted houses. However, once we opened the apartment door, we were both shocked at the size and quality of the apartment. It's decorated with lots of new-englandy antiques, with art on the walls of the three large rooms, and a big, comfortable, bed.

Also, the location is pretty great despite the struggling neighborhood. The apartment is just a few blocks from Hudson's main street with a long stretch of antique stores, restaurants, and small local stores. It's also a short walk to an amazing restaurant opened by the owners of Fatty Crab in New York called Fish and Game.

Thanks for a great place!"

Stayed a few nights","I highly recommend Laura Ann's former schoolhouse-turned-inn for your stay in Hudson and/or the greater Hudson Valley area. Some might find being smack in the middle of a cemetery a bit morbid, but the neighbors are very quiet and it really is a tranquil setting. Plus, there's lots of history in the cemetery itself. The loft looked exactly like the pictures, was clean, quirky, comfortable, eclectic, and radiated a positive energy. Laura Ann was extremely responsive, graciously picked me up at the train station (along with her cockatiel), and provided many eating and shopping recommendations that all proved excellent (PLEASE go to Lil Deb's!). I wouldn't mind returning for my next stay up the river."

The room was also Feng Shui’d I believe if the book next to the bed was any indication so we slept great! The incense added to the atmosphere and the vibe, the room was very inviting and warm. Some of the most unique furniture I’ve seen! Don’t let the whole being inside a cemetery thing turn you away nothing about the location felt unsettling or off and the location into town is the perfect distance for some privacy while still being able to walk to Warren Street. Laura Ann is an amazing host who responds very quickly with suggestions and recommendations. She even left a little pastry outside the door every day so we had a bite to eat before going off in the morning! The kitchen is stocked with all sorts of kitchen gadgets that cooking any great meal is possible. A very memorable and must stay if you’re spending a romantic or special weekend in Hudson!"

It's quiet, interesting and I loved the unique, artistic touches in the room. What makes the booking extra special is Laura Ann and her hosting. She was communicative and helpful from the start and even was able to pick me up and drop me off from the train station, which I sincerely appreciated it. She gave me plenty of recommendations and there are notes and thoughtful touches all in the room and at the property. The birds are also super sweet and social! The walk from the Warren strip to her place is relatively quick and quiet and you can see so many stars at night. 10/10 would return again!"

Stayed a few nights","What a sweet place Laura Ann has here! We liked being in the middle of a cemetery, and we really liked the space inside our unit. Laura Ann has a quirky and inspiring decorating sense. She is also a true conservationist: the only paper you'll find there is TP (and no kitchen towels that we could find); there are kind notes to avoid overusing water and she keeps a tight lid on heat usage. These are things we do at our own home and I was impressed that she carries these important practices into her business.
We met only one of Laura Ann's two cockatoos - Poppy (Popcorn) which was a real treat. The antique Chinese bedstead, while beautiful to look at, is not super comfortable but it was okay for us for a few days; it's also a double size so tall people and wide people may not be comfortable. Hudson is a fun city with what seem lots of new shops and restaurants occupying lovely old buildings."

Great to walk and run around the area, go for picnics and hikes or just sit in the town- amazing to return home to this cozy room. Perfect for 2 people! Laura Ann is a wonderful host and made sure everything was provided with ample blankets, coffee, shower supplies, cookware etc."

Laura Ann was great with communication and kind enough to let us hang out one night with her cockatoos - Tico and Popcorn. Although Hudson is a bit cold and snowy in December, we had a great time and an awesome room to come back to each night. I would definitely return to Laura Ann's place during the summer!"

Stayed one night","The Asian Room isn’t your typical Airbnb. We were met by the warmest hostess who picked us up at the train station with the friendliest cockatoo, Tico-Rico. When we reached our room, we were met with a lush, unique, and mystical space. The room has a wow factor in its design, but was also very cozy. You’ll sleep on a cloud in her opium bed, but check out its intricate carvings in the daylight. Finally, the town itself is super cute, and you can find plenty to do. We loved the pastries left for us at the door the morning after! A must stay, and highly recommended. Thank you for this invigorating retreat!"

It is of course sitting right in the middle of a cemetery, about 0.5 miles from the main part of town. Despite being out of town for most of our visit, LA was very attentive to our needs and requests for local recommendations.
The Mad Hatter is in the basement and is acceptable but not luxurious. The Asian Room upstairs is much more spacious and comfortable, quite special.
Many thanks."

Gave us all kinds of lovely recommendations. Left us fresh strawberries and pastries for the morning. Shared her 3 absolutely fabulous cockatoos with us...we admittedly fell a bit in love with our new feathered friends. The Asia room was spectacular--so funky and fun, we loved every ounce of the vibe and feel. The only thing we'll think about for next time is maybe adding a couple extra blankets on top of the opium bed mattress...it's quite firm ;) We could go on and on about our stay...the setting was also brilliant. The walk into town is an easy and fun stroll, and the town itself is as charming as they come. We cannot wait to go back! Hoping to bring a handful of our friends along to enjoy the 3 other fab spaces Laura Ann has on offer. 110% will be back!"

As is common with unique spaces, the pictures shown hardly do justice to the purely magical experience of being in the home nor the glory of it’s location; a free standing tower overseeing a beautiful cemetery on all sides. A lovely short walk to town as well.
Though your privacy is absolutely respected, Laura Ann’s ecstatic spirit and artistic vision are present across the building, and we couldn’t be more excited to return to sample the other rooms to take more of it in when we return. We were honored with a peak at one room in the works, that when complete, will surely cement this spot’s reputation as Hudson’s own little Madonna Inn."

The space is so amazing and enjoyable to relax in that we stayed in both evenings and enjoyed some dinner and cocktails. Everything was just perfect with our visit.

Laura Ann was out of town, but one of the residents in the house picked us up from the train station, and even let us drop off our bags and drove us to the top of Warren so we could get brunch!
The end of Warren is pretty close, but Warren is a long stretch, so it could take you like 30-45 mins to walk the whole street (without stopping) - but my boyfriend and I enjoyed the walk and looking at the shops. We LOVE cemeteries, so it was such a cool location, being inside a cemetery. We took so many photos!

Normally we sleep in a queen size bed, and typically like having a larger bed so we can each have our own space. So we were a little bit concerned that it would be too small. It really wasn't! I'm 5'10"", we're both pretty fit people and we slept just fine.
We also made use of the refrigerator, stove, microwave, and most everything else in the kitchen for a couple of our meals. Everything worked great.
We're definitely hoping to revisit sometime!"

Stayed one night","A converted schoolhouse that is nestled in a historic cemetery - and it's every bit the interesting and unique experience that you could imagine. Laura Ann is an absolutely delightful host: friendly, helpful, quick to respond, everything that you hope for in an Airbnb host. The building and this particular room are fun, funky, quite comfortable, well appointed, completely interesting spaces that make you smile and engage all your senses, making for a completely enjoyable stay."

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I spent a long-awaited getaway weekend in The Asia Room at Laura Ann's place. Tiana was there to greet us when we arrived, despite our being late. The space was exactly as pictured; plenty of light, plenty of space and a total cocoon-like bed. We loved every second of being snowed in Saturday AM, and once the roads were cleared it was a 2 minute drive into a town FULL of restaurants, antique shops and galleries. It was perfect! HIGHLY recommended space and host!"

I'd go back just to hang with Tiko some more, but also the place had a perfect vibe, was immaculate, and the decor details were really special. Great for a writer's retreat space, or romantic weekend. Staying in a graveyard was surreal and added a layer of quiet peacefulness. I will definitely be back!"

Stayed one night","My wife and I LOVED staying here! The space is fantastic and incredibly unique, and Laura Ann is the BEST host.

First, the place is like a loft, with super high ceilings and industrial features, yet warm and inviting thanks to the exotic decor, great lighting, and bright colors. The Chinese wedding bed was brilliant - I wouldn't have thought it possible, but I'm 6'3"" and my wife and I slept in there well. And the bathroom and kitchen were clean and modern (which I love).

Second, Laurie was unbelievably welcoming and hospitable - she was funny, sweet, and diligent, and even offered us rides to/from the station.

The location is unusual, but is only 10-15 mins walk to town, and it helps keep things quiet and serene - not creepy at all, particularly since it's an active cemetery despite being old (e.g. families visiting loved ones, etc)."

The decor was beautiful. Lots of sunlight during the morning without it being overbearing. We were able to sleep in just fine. Very charming location to spend a weekend. The town of Hudson was great. Felt secure at all times of the day, even at night despite the cemetery. Definitely the best Airbnb experience so far!"

Stayed a few nights","Our host, Laura Ann, was just terrific --- warm, welcoming, and always wanting to help us. We even had Chinese food in her loft (with the cockatoos) and watched the second presidential debates together.

We just LOVED being in this loft --- very good for concentration (great long table), fantastic fun bed, very artistic, very large. Every little detail was great-- even cake under glass left at our door. It was a fun experience and we brought chinese robes to add to it! The cemetery is beautiful and it is peaceful to be in such a quiet place-- really silent, but not at all scary. We came without a car. The walk to Warren Street is easy and you can take a shortcut through the cemetery. We would definitely return! This is a great place to stay even longer, to bring books or to write. I think it would be great in any season.
Every amenity is thought out and thoughtful, down to the pile of books left to read in the reading corner. There are nice soaps, nice shampoo --- you can see that everything is done with great care. I actually wouldn't mind going there for a month just to relax and escape from NY City."

Stayed one night","One of our best Airbnb experiences ever! Laura was a perfect host! On our arrival she greeted us as if we were old friends, and we were made to feel right at home! She took us to our room, showed us around, and introduced us to tiko, her pet cockatoo, who made himself right at home on my husbands shoulder!!
The space is one in a million! The room was even more beautiful in person. It is filled with some of the most beautiful furniture I've ever seen, as well as some beautiful art pieces created by our wonderfully talented host. You can just tell how much love and care went into making this a very unique and tranquil space. laura is very accessible should you need anything. She responds within minutes and will also check with you to make sure you have everything you need.

The schoolhouse is perfectly located... Walking distance to warren street for cool shops and great food. Places of interest, hiking, etc are all just a very short drive.

The only thing lacking for us was time - We only stayed one night. We do hope to come back again soon to truly enjoy all that this great town has to offer!!"

The location in the cemetery allowed for some privacy without moving us too far away from the downtown area. Laura Ann was a welcoming host who not only picked us up from the train station, but also left breakfast outside of our room every morning. We recommend this Air BnB to anyone looking for the luxuries of a fully functional suite combined with an eclectic experience you would not receive at a hotel."

Stayed a few nights","We had an absolutely spectacular time during our stay this weekend in Laura's loft. The loft itself was absolutely gorgeous. It was beautiful, spacious, and extremely clean. The furniture and art work are one of a kind, making the loft feel that much more special and intimate. The pictures of the listing are exactly as shown. It is even more impressive in person. Upon arrival, the facade of the building is so inviting, instantly making you feel like you've stepped back in time. Upon our arrival we were greeted by Laura and Tiko who we instantly felt comfortable with. The building itself is stunning with artwork covering the walls and work done by Laura herself. Laura was extremely informative giving us a tour of the loft, and letting us know where things were for our use. She was also extremely quick in her communication with us. She was a quick email away if and when we had a question. We had all of the amenities one could ask for during a short weekend getaway. The view of the cemetery from the loft is beyond calming, with a staircase to stand outside and relax on with a morning cup of coffee. The AC unit worked beautifully as well, and the bed was beyond comfortable. We slept like babies. In the event we became warm, Laura also provided us with a fan to help cool down the space. The two mornings we woke up in the loft, we were left with a morning surprise; coffee cake on a plate left by Laura. How thoughtful of her. It's the little details that make it worth the trip. Our checkout was effortless and we cannot wait to come back and visit. The listing is a short walk to town where there were so many wonderful antique shops and restaurants. Our trip and stay in Laura's loft was truly one of a kind that we were sad to leave. We cannot wait to return for another weekend. Thank you Laura for being such a wonderful, warm, and inviting host."

Within walking distance of Warren Street, although secluded just enough to be peaceful. Great energy. Room was extremely clean, and the bathroom is fantastic. We enjoyed the room so much that (unfortunately) we didn't even take time to explore the cemetery. We will definitely be back! Book this room (and these people (and birds))!!"

Stayed with a pet","There’s no denying this is a beautiful Airbnb. There are a few honest things I wish I had known before booking so I’ll lay them out for you now. 1. Noise. Lots of it. Between the street noise & the person occupying the space above you and pounding their feet on the floor into the wee hours. If you like your sleep, do not stay here. 2. Parking. It is NOT free. It is metered Monday-Saturday for 50 cents an hour- max is 2 hours. So if you’re driving in, plan to run back to your car to feed the meter all day.Overnight parking requires an alternate system. I didn’t even know what that was and had to look it up 3.Semi-pet friendly. I booked this place so I could bring my pug, and learned a few days before the trip they have a rule about no pets on the bed. That’s not happening with a pug. So I didn’t bring him. 4. Transparency. I wish I had known these things before booking. If you’re a city dweller who can take the train in you’ll be fine. If you’re used to the quiet, maybe rethink this one"

Stayed with a pet","This stay was beautiful, the apartment was well furnished and in a great location. I really appreciated how flexible Zach was when my dog sitter didn't work out, and I needed to bring my dog along at the last minute. The only thing I wasn't totally happy about was the cleanliness of the apartment. I'm not sure if it just didn't get cleaned as thoroughly as it usually does, but I found dirty dishes out when I arrived. I also found hair that didn't belong to my guest or I in the bathroom and shower. Additionally, my dog found some food on the floor that was under a chair. Maybe it was a fluke since many of the previous reviews are about how clean it is. Other than that, I really enjoyed staying here and would come back again."

A big project she will complete beautifully when she has time. One suggestion is that softer pillows are put into the small bedroom as they are quite hard ! Other than that we were really at home and hope you found it in excellent order. Thank you so much for having us

Stayed a few nights","Super cute apartment in a great spot on the main street of Hudson - all the restaurants, bars, and shops are within walking distance, and the apartment itself was super clean and well decorated. Only 2 small complaints: one is there isn’t free parking like the listing says. Zach does a great job explaining the confusing parking in Hudson, but there’s no designated parking space and you’ll still have to park on the street and move your car all the time to avoid tickets. The other complaint is that the building itself is pretty old, and as such there’s lots of noise - both from the unit above and from the busy street outside. Not a huge issue, but do be warned that it can be pretty loud on Friday/Saturday nights as people walk up and down Warren street from the bars. But other than that the apartment was great! Definitely a great place if you’re looking to stay in Hudson."

Stayed with a pet","In hindsight, I was the worst guest you could imagine. I misread something and let it effect my mood and attitude. I owe a huge apology to our hosts!
This is a fabulous place to stay in “uptown"" Hudson. It’s close to the Hudson River and the train station. It’s in the midst of the arts and antiques businesses on Warren Street.
We love dining at Feast and Floret and found ourselves there once again. We loved being so close having had a few drinks with dinner.
Our hosts were kind enough to open our door when I confused the access code arriving home. They are an amazing young couple with excellent taste in interior design and outfitting the perfect apartment.
I was pleasantly surprised at how quiet the street noise was in the morning. I expected to be woken up early by cars/trucks. We slept until 9am!! It was great!
Did I mention the shower? Best ever...
This is a delightful apartment and the hosts couldn’t be better! We highly recommend you stay here!"

We loved going to Hudson Roastery in the morning and the French restaurant right next door for lunch.

Stayed a few nights","If I could give this place more than 5 stars I would.
The space is so well thought out, charming, spacious, and comfortable. I did feel like I was transported to Paris, with the tall windows and beautiful light. Felt very comfortable and safe in this apartment alone. The updated restroom and kitchen are wonderful. The shower is just enough pressure and gets pretty hot. The bed is comfortable, and I used the daybed in the smaller room to drink my morning tea, and read and write. The decor was perfect, I’m obsessed with the giant mirror! The tv mounted in front of the bed, but covetable was also nice touch.
For the space, I recommend 2 adults max, and 1 child potentially. The bed is big enough for two adults. The smaller room has a day bed that can easily sleep a child maybe below 7-8 years old if they aren’t too tall. Otherwise I used the room as my office and hang area.
The location was superb. It’s by some great shops and cafes and nothing is too far of a walk. It’s just one flight of stairs on a walk up. I walked everyday I was there, and when I couldn’t get a car to take me back to the Amtrak, I ended up walking all the way there. About 20-25 min straight shot, not bad.
The host Zachary was so easy to communicate with, and courteous, and really did not need to contact them much. The doors are automated making the entry easy to come and go.
This is probably one of the best airbnbs I’ve ever stayed at."

Please note: this apartment faces Warren street (what a perk!) , which can be quite busy. If you are a light sleeper, you may be woken/kept up, by the cars going up and the street, as this is an older building, there is not much for sound proofing on the windows."

My friend and I felt like Emily in Paris. The entire apartment was very clean, and the bathroom and amenities were nice, too. The host was very communicative, and the check-in was very seamless. A few things to be mindful of... There is a long narrow staircase to walk up to, so those with a big suitcase would have a bit of trouble carrying the luggage up. Also, the apartment is located in a popular area, so while it's easy to navigate around the town, it's a bit noisy early in the morning and sometimes at night due to cars driving by."

We were here in early spring, place was nice and warm - the radiant heat in the floor is utterly delightful! The place was super-clean and fresh. In response to other reviewers, I brought a dishpan but the bathroom sink, while small, was serviceable for washing out cups and plates. The two steep stairs down to enter were not a problem for us but if you badly need a new hip or knee, you might find that rough. Had some delightful meals in Hudson and nearby Rheinbeck. great recommendations from the host. Great experience."

Being only a block and a half from Warren St. made so we didn’t have to use the car to explore. Nancy also gave really detailed instructions and recommendations. As others have mentioned, I wish there was a better way to wash up dishes than in the bathroom, but it was a really minor thing as we only had one meal in the apartment given the great food options in town. We will very happily stay again next time we’re in town!"

Our bedroom was very comfortable, and had everything that we absolutely needed. Closet space and additional hooks would be perfect.

Stayed a few nights","Overall, it was ok. Things to know before you go: There are no places to hang clothes, and they're were no hangers for our stay (though I'm right there's usually...one). Made it hard to iron or steam suits and dresses for the wedding we attended, because we had nowhere to put the clothes to dry or keep from wrinkling. You will need to run dehumidifiers at all hours and empty the collectors every day; these dehumidifiers emit lots of heat, so the room is toasty at all times--great unless you want to go to sleep. We needed to keep the patio doors open and have them battle the dehumidifiers to keep temps lower. Then mosquitos came. There's a low rack in the bathroom for toiletries, but basically no sink space (couldn't even balance their cups on the sink). Bed is extremely springy, such that any movement will jiggle the entire thing. Watch your hands on the second (of three!) doors into the unit because it's so close to the doorframe that it will cut your finger if you aren't careful."

Stayed a few nights","This is an attractive basement walkout, nicely decorated and equipped in a great location - walkable to great restaurants and breweries and in reach of so much of interest in the area.
Because it’s a basement, dehumidifiers run 24/7 and heat up the place. There’s an air conditioner but it struggles to keep up with the heat output. Together they create considerable ambient noise, which people who sleep with fans will appreciate. Probably very cozy in winter!
You climb a set of stairs to get the key and then down that set and another short set of stairs accesses the unit’s entrance. The vestibule has a stone that doesn’t completely fill the dirt floor and makes for tricky footing while you’re loading in. None of this presented a serious issue for us since we’re agile."

However, there were two bulky pieces of equipment (one a dehumidifier and the other an AC unit) that were not shown in the photos in the listing -- and we did not learn about the dehumidifier until we received our check-in instructions. Unfortunately the AC was in a room separated by a partial wall so it did not cool the whole place down effectively. Our biggest complaint was that it was warm but little could have been done about it given where the AC unit was located. Even though it wasn't as light and bright as the photos on the listing -- and the dehumidifier and AC were also not shown in the photos (which was misleading) overall the space was cozy and cute. And again... can't beat the location!"

Stayed with a pet","Three stars because it is a very cute basement apartment with incredible built ins, very clean, and a short 2 minute walk to Warren street with great restaurants and shops. However I visited with my elderly mother and dog and being that we both have Asthma, I wish we would have known the apartment smelled of mold and was equipped with 2 large dehumidifier’s which each needed to be emptied twice a day. They are not shown in photos or mentioned and I wish we would have known this beforehand as we had reactions, coughing and allergies and had not planned on this added maintenance for clean air. Additionally there is a sound sensor and camera at the airbnbs door, when it’s opened you can hear it activate on a higher floor of the home alerting the host of our coming and going. I’ve never experienced this type of monitoring from a host, it made us uncomfortable, we felt like we were being watched and there was no mention of this beforehand."

Very close to Amtrak/Warren street. Highly recommend Moto Coffee which is a 3 minute walk and The Maker Cafe."

Stayed one night",Overall great place for a 1-2 day visit. But it is a basement unit (did not appreciate this based on the photos / description provided) with a portable AC cooling it down. AC didn’t work too well for us but again wasn’t a big deal given our 1 night stay. Would’ve loved to have paid less for the stay but wasn’t too disappointed.

Stayed a few nights",Nancy was very responsive. This is a bottom floor studio with no separation between the daybed and the bed. I think I looked at the pictures showing the hallway and misunderstood but we were fine. There is no space to hang clothes or put items away and no storage in the bathroom. We were able to use the chairs to lay out our wedding attire but there were plenty of towels and the beds were comfortable. The daybed in the living room does squeak when you move in it but was very nice to sleep in. If someone is staying in the unit above you will hear them. Luckily our upstairs neighbors were very courteous and we didn't hear anything late at night. Lovely park across the street and very walkable to any restaurants on Warren Street.

Stayed with kids","This is a BASEMENT unit, and it very much feels like a basement. Felt that the pictures and description were misleading…not as upscale as presented. Entry is unsafe if arriving at night (it was very dark and I tripped on the uneven floors), and the hall to the unit is very unwelcoming. The bathroom is tiny, as is the shower. Towels had a mildew smell and the AC unit is quite loud, especially at night. The location is close to restaurants/shops, but also a block away from a state Correctional facility. Left feeling unhappy with the stay and the price."

Stayed one night","This is a very well located garden level/basement apartment in a townhouse on a quiet block next to a park. Check in was easy and there were really nice sheets and ample towels. Nancy responded immediately when we had an issue with the TV. The only downsides were that the space was a bit musty, and there was a very large and loud air conditioner in the main room, along with a dehumidifier. Those with respiratory conditions might have issues. We also found the space a bit cramped for three people with little storage space in the bathroom. But it’s a great location and Nancy was a lovely host."

When we reached out to Nancy regarding lighting, she responded within minutes. We loved the decor- lots of character with the built-ins, mirrors, & books. There was an abundance of linens,blankets, & towels. We sat outside to read, listen to the birds,and have a glass of wine. We loved Wunderbar Bistro for more casual dining as well as W.H. Farmer for more gourmet style meals and drinks! Felt at home here and is definitely a place to return to! Gail & Nancy"

The damp weather did mean emptying the dehumidifier quite a bit, including once late at night, but fortunately, Nancy was able and willing to allow us a bit more time to rest on our last day. Plus, the rain was needed and obviously not Nancy’s fault. Highly recommended!"

The main queen bed is comfy but we found the day bed to be a little stiffer than we would normally like.
We had three women stay here and I think it would be more comfortable for a couple.
Nancy is quick to respond to any questions you have."

We discovered places on both banks of the Hudson with hikes found in a book in the apartment and a great Cidery that we shared with the Jonas Brothers. The apartment is cozy and was a great place to relax after a day spent exploring the area. The apartment on lower Warren is highly recommended."

Stayed a few nights","We were in Hudson for the long weekend surrounding the NYState sheep & wool festival in rhinebeck. Hudson was abt a 20 min drive and wonderful in that it’s not overcrowded with festival attendees.
Jenny’s place is well-appointed and comfortable. It’s also restful and we really enjoyed our time there.
A bonus for us was Billie Holiday (a small white dog) who lived next door. We just lost our small white pupper Phil, and Saturday morning during our stay, I heard some small footsteps on the back deck. When I looked out the back window, YAY! The Puppy Distribution System was in full force and we got to spend some quality time with Billie. Well, maybe only 5 minutes, but for us, terribly missing our dog, it was wonderful. Thank you Billie’s human, Jenny and Billie Holiday herself for some very welcome wiggles and pets."

The apartment is on a street that comes close to having the most traffic, on foot and by car, in the downtown Hudson area. The layout of the apartment and plantings in front provide a decent setback and ample quiet inside.
The apartment itself was very well appointed, all the entry and checkout instructions were clear and simple. There are books and online info on local food and sights. Jenny was incredibly welcoming, thoughtful and responsive to us on a number of levels. Take her advice on restaurants and you will be SO happy you did!"

The apartment is extremely spruce + clean, the beds are highly comfortable, and shower is great. Above all, the hosts are extremely kind people and super responsive about all aspects. This is the rare Airbnb where you feel a cozy sense of the person's home, and also excels in all areas of amenities one might want for a stay in Hudson.
There is AC in the two bedrooms which kept us nice and cool. The kitchen is well stocked, we were able to cook whole meals and there are delis/groceries nearby.
We would definitely stay here again (if amenable to the kind hosts), as it was very easy walking distance from both the Amtrak train station, shops + restaurants. Perfect for a family or couple.
Lastly, the friendly yellow door makes this place easy to spot, and is a great symbol of the cozy + high standards here."

Stayed with a pet","What a fabulous stay! Jenny is lovely and so is this apartment, which could not be more convenient to everything Hudson has to offer. Fabulous cafes and shops are just down the street in either direction but it somehow feels calm because the bedroom and back patio are away from the street and the house is already set back itself. Lots of free on-street parking too, and the kitchen is very well provisioned. The only thing we’d note is that the second bedroom is really small, so much so that it would be hard to close the door (we used it for storage). But for the two of us, it was the perfect base for a week-plus Hudson Valley vacation."

First of all, we lovvvved the aesthetics of the apartment, from the tasteful art on the walls to the eclectic dinnerware, to the great books on the shelves. Jenny has the decorating Midas touch! Great energy throughout.
Secondly, the beds were very comfortable, the bath towels soft, and had a great back patio for morning Joe. All the extra touches meant a lot to us. Fresh coffee beans. A new tube of toothpaste and extra toothbrushes (hubs forgot his paste, daughter forgot toothbrush) in the bathroom medicine cabinet.
We were walking distance to everything we needed. Great restaurants, great shops, great coffee. Being a California girl, I loved the little organic nonprofit, Rolling Grocer, half a block away.
Jenny was super responsive and super cool. Next time I’m in Hudson, I sure hope her place is available. It was a comfortable, sensory sanctuary.
Thank you Jenny!

The apartment itself was super clean and cozy. The rain shower was amazing. And the space was a great size for me, my husband and our dog. The fenced in yard was such a nice luxury for the pup!
We’ll definitely recommend Jenny’s place to friends looking for a nice getaway!"

Jenny was a great host. Welcomed me when I got in and kept up quick communication. I accidentally left behind some toiletries & medication -- and she helped make sure that they got back to me. 5 out 5 stars."

Stayed about a week","This was my second visit to Hudson and staying at Jenny’s lovely cottage made it an amazing and unforgettable trip. I came here to work on a creative project (and my day job) and was able to get all of the things done that I wanted to because I was able to relax in this lovely environment.
The colors in the space along with the eclectic collection of books and pieces of artwork around the home made it really fun. Every day I was discovering something else that was interesting like books on decorating or a lovely wood curtain rod in one of the bedrooms. Don’t get me started on the shower. The rainforest showerhead is a dream and the selection of lovely soaps and body washes were a really nice touch and very thoughtful.
A friend joined me for the latter portion of the visit and she loved it as well. We both will be back. Jenny is an amazing host and Kent is as well. I had a few minor issues and they both were super responsive and helped to alleviate things quickly.
Last but not least, Jenny’s place is in close proximity to so many cool restaurants and art galleries and other sites to see!
This was one of the most fun and relaxing work trips I’ve ever had! I highly recommend this stay!
Thanks, Jenny and Kent!"

The bed and the sheets were phenomenal. The shower head was the size of a plate and also amazing. It had a cute outdoor patio that was wonderful for writing and dreaming.

Her home was everything I hoped for and more! A jewel box of a place. Ultra comfortable beds and linens, the dreamiest shower, beautiful, thoughtful original design and custom-built specialness throughout. Hand-picked delights everywhere (art and photography, that book collection, swoon, yes those cool and very functional hooks). There’s a fab little kitchen with a gorgeous stove for cooking outfitted with all the basics plus, should you choose to stay in. La Perche, Verdigris, Moto coffee, Maker Hotel just steps away make it easy to explore great local food. This is a special part of Warren Street, quiet, bright and cheerful.
Amazing! Could not recommend it more highly.
Creating a home and hosting is clearly a labor of love for Jenny. She’s a wonderful person. A complete and utter joy to stay with: lovely, thoughtful, responsive and warm.
I’ll be back soon. Come stay here! You’ll love it."

There were A/C units in the bedrooms that worked well and for parking we were easily able to find free (no meter) street parking. We enjoyed a nice lunch from items we collected at the farmers market out on the back patio of the apartment. Jenny thoughtfully provided shampoo, conditioner, and body wash for us, which was really helpful. To top it off, Jenny is incredibly warm and sweet. We loved this place -- perfect for our group of four -- and look forward to staying here on a future visit to Hudson :)"

Stayed a few nights","My wife & I loved our stay in Jenny's home. It was very clean, and in an excellent location within easy walking distance to all of the cafes, stores and other Hudson attractions on Warren street. Checking in and out was seamless and we were able to find parking right outside our door. We can't wait to visit again!"

Stayed a few nights","Jenny’s pace was great! Perfect location, clean, and one of the most comfortable beds I’ve slept in. Check in was a breeze and Jenny was quick to respond and very accommodating when we wanted to check out a bit later. Highly recommended.
Thanks Jenny!"

Stayed a few nights","Jenny’s place is an absolute gem and I highly recommend her space for your stay. The apartment is located right on Warren Street and the perfect spot to walk to the endless options of cafes, restaurants, galleries and shops. The apartment is quiet and cozy and you’ll feel right at home from the minute you walk through the door. It is thoughtfully designed, impeccably clean and the most comfortable bed that I’ve slept in while traveling. I would recommend this space to anyone traveling to Hudson!"

Stayed one night","I booked Jenny’s place for a quick midweek stay, and it is utterly adorable! The photos only hint at what a sweet place it is. It's charming and stylish, with so many touches that make it feel like a home away from home, only nicer.
There are thoughtful touches everywhere—great books to look at, art by local artists on the walls, cool and lovely furniture, beautifully finished knotty pine floors, fresh paint, a cute, well-laid out kitchen with everything you might need, all clean lines and bright colors. The back door opens out onto a new deck that is perfect for morning coffee. The two bedrooms are cozy and the was amazingly comfortable. The blackout shades were great, and the AC kept the apartment really cool. The bathroom is beautifully tiled and has a sleek curbless shower, marble counter and frosted windows. The shower has amazing locally made organic body wash, shampoo and conditioner, and the shower head is like standing under a waterfall!
Jenny is a cheerful and totally accessible host—even though she’s in Brooklyn she wanted to make sure I got checked in with no hassle, and is ready with great recommendations for the many cool places to walk to—restaurants, stores, boutiques. I loved Cafe Le Perche just a few doors down, and Wm. Farmer and Sons, which is a five minute stroll from the house.
Great stay, great place, great host. Hudson is a gem of a city and this is a gem of an airbnb, and I plan to stay here whenever I visit!"

Stayed a few nights","I have stayed in many Airbnbs and they rarely feel like hotels. This felt like a hotel, but also like a home! The bedding was so soft and cozy; the decor was fun and mod, but live-able mod, not too dramatic. There good books to read, a quality tv, ac units, and a fully stocked kitchen. And a rain shower in the bathroom! Literally, everything was available and more. There were so many little touches that made this feel really like a special stay. I was able to meet Jenny as we head out and she's just as lovely as the apartment! Also location can't be beat -- you can walk from Amtrak and walk all over town and have a totally car-free experience quite easily. We will be back!"

Stayed with kids","We had the best stay at Jenny's home. She was sooo accommodating to our needs and even let us check in a day early for a lower rate, as our plans changed at the last minute! It was perfect for what we needed. She was there makin sure everything was perfect for our arrival so we got to meet her on her way out. The self check in is super easy and she had everything we needed. It was spotless, and beautifully decorated. We had zero issues and were actually more that impressed with her accommodations and communication. Her place is on the Main Street where all the stores and restaurant are, but not right in the middle of it all. Just at the end of where the action is. We would definitely suggest this to anyone looking to stay in Hudson."

Stayed with kids","Jenny is a terrific host. Very communicative and pleasant. Her home is cute as a button, with stylish touches that make spending time there all the more enjoyable. Though, if you're in hudson, you likely won't do much hanging out in the apartment. Everything is out your front door. Seriously amazing location. Great stay. Highly recommend!"
