Stayed one night",It was exactly what I needed for my over night trip go Stillwater for Special Olympics training. It was a great location. It had all the amenities needed and more! I always appreciate locations that provide some little touches and Tammy's spot offered this. Highly recommend and will seek out this spot for future stays in Stillwater.

Stayed a few nights","We stayed at Barefoot Creek for 2 nights while moving our daughter out of her dorm at OSU, which was .8 miles away. Tammy has done an amazing job transforming this downtown office buidling into an Airbnb oasis. She provided coffee, water, dishes, silverware, toiletries, a sound machine, a stand alone fan, an extension cord, streaming TV and very clear instructions on parking and staying there. I'm listing these items to make others aware, but I want to be clear that I don't consider any of these negatively. The bathroom was tiny and it has the only mirror, but for 2 of us it was fine. The rooms without an ensuite had use of a bigger bathroom. It was very bright in our room in the morning, but we both sleep with a mask on so this didn't bother us either. The beds and bedding were extremely soft, so we both slept great. We loved staying at barefoot creek, so we're going to book again in November."

It is super close to OSU, convenient and safe. The shower has fantastic water pressure, better than home! Tammy provided a fully stocked kitchenette and bathroom, I did not need a thing. William was there everyday cleaning and turning over the rooms. He was super friendly and made me feel at home. I highly recommend this airbnb, it is like a small hotel, and I found all of the other guests to be respectful, every guest kept to themselves and there were no disturbances or loud noises. Excellent experience. Thank you, Tammy & William!"

Stayed a few nights",Tammy and her husband William made the whole experience extremely pleasant. The creativity of the entire layout was phenomenal from the interior design to the layout of the entire place. I was beyond amazed with how they renovated the building to provide each room with every accessory and utility you could have. Bathrooms were fully stocked with everything you needed and the room was spotless. With that being said Tammy’s husband William was there nearly everyday cleaning and maintaining the building. William was friendly and respectful. The location is right in the center of the downtown area making it easy to get to all the main attractions of Stillwater. All around I would give this place 10 stars if I could and I will be staying here the next time I visit. Thank you both so much for the experience!

The bed was a little uncomfortable when my partner and I were sleeping in it together. The sink is a little smaller than I expected but we made it worked. For the price and location definitely worth it. Would probably stay again! I love how she had places she recommended! We really enjoyed a lot of her recommendations.

The corner haven room was smaller than we had anticipated but we were able to reserve another room and easily switch. Tammy and William are friendly, very responsive, the rooms are well kept and extremely clean. When we stayed in November my boyfriend forgot his laptop charger in the room. Knowing we’d be back in February he asked if they could just hold it for him which they did! Awesome place, great location and great people. Highly recommend!"

The room was small but it was exactly as the pictures looked and perfect for what we needed. They utilized the space very well. The price is awesome. We will definitely stay with them again. We have tried to book many times but they fill up very quickly. I think that shows that they are very good.
The only suggestion I would make is to possibly add a small foldable chair to the room. It would be a nice addition so you do not have to only sit on the bed. Other than that is was great."

The existing shelves are all full, so finding room for all the pillows on the bed and our things was a little challenging. The bed was also creaky, so every time one of us moved, you could hear it. It was comfortable though."

While somewhat out of her control, there was a party on the back patio where there were people peeing and throwing up. In addition, we found a pair of dirty panties under the bed while stripping the bed before checkout. I wish the place was a better fit, but I would probably not stay here again."

Stayed a few nights",I’ve stayed in two rooms at this location now. This one has its own bathroom which is a nice perk. However I prefer the Cozy Cottage over Corner Haven. I was able to hear a woman having a phone conversation in the next room and it sounded like she was in the room with me. The coffee pot in this room has a short cord and doesn’t reach the plug. The sink in the bathroom is tiny which makes it very difficult to brush one’s teeth. During my first stay in this room the shower never got hot but it appears that problem has been fixed. I had plenty of hot water this time. Would stay again but I prefer the other room!

The mattresses, pillows, and linen added to the comfort of the large beds. What is really great is the large private yard. It is perfectly set up for family gatherings. We will check to see if it is available the next time we need to stay in Stillwater."

Stayed a few nights","Gretchen's facility definitely met our initial expectations based on the content and on the photos presented on its online listing page. The house appeared to be very clean and spacious enough, and we didn't encounter any difficulties with finding or using there the necessary kitchenware, bathrooms, air conditioner, etc. It was also pretty quiet while we were staying there. There were some difficulties with parking, as our car has a low bumper and as the main parking slot there is not very well-adopted to such cars. During our stay in that facility, we were also notified by the neighbors that parking the car in the street near the facility was not possible as well. So we still had to use the main parking option, in any case. At the same time, it was also nice to see that the house has all the necessary furniture, lamps, kitchenware, laundry, etc. and that the furniture and the necessary equipment are in a good state there at present. We liked our stay in that facility much, merci!"

The homeowner called me to check in on us and made sure we were okay and everything was okay the following day. To me that was very caring and thoughtful for them to check on us. Being 8 hours from home with a toddler isn’t always easy. They were very polite about us getting checking in at 3am and checking out after 11. Not to mention the place was SPOTLESS! So clean! Made me feel at home and relaxed. If i come back to Stillwater i definitely would want to stay there again!

Stayed a few nights","There are so many good things about Janelle's property which is why I gave it 5 stars. We will definitely stay there again when we are in Stillwater. It is perfect for OSU parents visiting their kids. It's about 10-15 minutes from campus.
Janelle and her family are very considerate of their guests, for instance, during our stay the weather was really bad, (severe thunderstorms, heavy rain and tornados) for the area. Janelle's husband called to offer access to their panic room in their home if we felt uncomfortable with the weather. We really appreciated the offer, it was really kind of them to think of us.
Finally, this is not a negative on the property by any means but don't use Waze and Google maps when trying to find the address. We found this out the hard way but on the bright side we saw some beautiful countryside. Apple maps worked perfectly.
I highly recommend this property. I promise, you won't be disappointed.
Thank you!

Stayed over a week","This space was beautiful, small house with everything someone would need. Newly renovated and very clean. Well furnished with a comfortable bed and not too far out or town. Janelle and Jeff were very helpful with check-in and some local recommendations!
Only heads up I would provide is that the water heater is small (28 gallons) so the shower only has 5-10 minutes of hot water (with great water pressure). However, there is a heater build into the bathroom vent you can turn on. So for someone who takes longer showers, it still stays comfortably warm if you need to turn the water off here and there to make it last longer!
All considered, it is a great value for the price and I will absolutely stay again if my work brings me back to the area!"

Stayed a few nights","Tucked away in a quiet neighborhood surrounded by taller apartment buildings that seemingly protect you from the elements is a place where you can relax and unwind. Andrea's place is filled with character and history - a history that may date back to the married housing provided to soldiers returning from WWII who sought to use their G.I. Bill at OSU. The interior makes one feel at home as if visiting a sibling or cousin with really good taste for decoration. The kitchen provides ample space for those who prefer cooking their own meals. The bedroom is spacious, comfortable, and will put you at ease when you need it the most. The bathroom is clean and bright.
Andrea has provided a cozy spot that makes you feel as though you have always belonged to the Stillwater and OSU community. Her Oklahoman hospitality rings true and is a testament to the care Andrea has taken to make your stay comfortable, safe, and quiet for the ""sleepy"" traveler."

Stayed a few nights","We loved our time at The Nest. It’s comfortable, clean, laid out well, in (what I like to call) manicured nature, private and filled with natural light (while also having blackout shades). The front porch was a very nice place to sit, chat, eat, read and was almost always shaded from the sun. We loved making s’mores in the fire pit under the string lights. The fire starter log also made the evening incredibly simple. The property is nice to walk around and there is a pond but I’d say it’s on the very very small side. Stillwater itself I cannot recommend as much but if the goal is time away in a nice space to rest The Nest is a home run. A couple spots we found worth mentioning in Stillwater were Devoted (a ramen restaurant tucked away in the back of an Asian market) and Balanced Coffee. Highly recommend this spot."

The bed was very comfortable and I enjoyed hearing the rain on the metal roof at night. I would love to visit in the fall or winter months to sit outside by the fire pit and enjoy the fall foliage of the surrounding woods. Great Air BnB experience!"

And then you go to a place like this that is everything they say it is and more.
New, fresh, clean. Amazing location. Modern and on trend. Walking trails, etc.
I loved this place and would go back a million times."

The cottage is wonderful, but we also really enjoy the grounds.
The communication with our hosts was awesome. We have stayed twice this last year….and both times the response to any question was almost immediate. The second visit I struggled to get the fire lit, and our host was there in 5 minutes to get it going.
I’m inspired to have my own Air B&B like these someday. So important to have a place to escape and getaway."

Turned out much better than I could imagine. Everything about this place was amazing! After settling in, we drove a whopping 4 miles to enjoy dinner. After dinner, I started a nice fire outside in the shared chill space. Wife beat me to the tub while I was watching the fire. The tub was awesome!!! I soaked in it for Atleast 30 minutes. Just what this tired body needed! Then, to close the the evening, we played card games by the fireplace. 🤷🏽‍♂️ Who says I’m not Romantic? I will definitely book this place again in the near future.

Stayed a few nights","ALL TIME FAVORITE!
This was one of the best Airbnb homes we’ve ever stayed in. My wife, two sons and I had an amazing time here! The cabin is cozy, and a perfect size for our family. The home is about a seven minute drive to town, and only about ten minutes from Walmart if you need anything. The bed and couch bed are comfy, the AC works great, and the bathroom is huge. The kitchen has all amenities you’d need to cook meals too. We spent a lot of time on the front porch while it rained and stayed dry. Plus there’s a nice fire pit if you want that one evening.
But the cool part is you’re far enough out and secluded (minus the other cabin next door) that you feel isolated and away from it all. You’re surrounded by lush trees, grasses and flowers that allow you to relax and slow down. Plus plenty of birds chirping and frogs croaking to make you feel like you’re in the middle of nowhere. Bonus: tons of fireflies at night!
Plus, there’s a private pond right behind your cabin! We fished on and off for four days and caught tons of bluegill and a few bass. My son caught his first fish on this trip too!
As for the hosts, you couldn’t ask for better. They were super fast at responding, and were extremely helpful. This was hands down one of our favorite Airbnb stays to date! Our son might have thrown a little fit when we told him we had to go home today! Can’t wait to go back. If you’re considering this place, do it! You’ll be as happy as we were."

Stayed with kids","all around, we were pleased with our stay. It's in an old home with cute, up to date decor very well done. Was clean. Not so much under the bed in the middle bedroom. Granddaughter dropped something that rolled under the bed I had sweep it out from under. Old socks and much dust! The showers had intermitted hot and cold water even though we spread out our showers. The beds were comfortable. Outside of the main bedroom, a light kept coming on and going off throughout the night keeping me awake. Might have been the house behind us with the dogs. Which by the way just happened to be the house my deceased brother lived in! We were in Stillwater for his funeral. The back yard was awful and empty aluminum cans were lying around. The home can benefit from a visit from an exterminator because we killed lots of spiders! In all, I'd like to thank the hosts for all their quick responses and for making an older home comfortable and ecstatically comfortable. Toni"

The sleeping arrangements were not super clear so my recommendation would be to check to make sure it works to have the sofa sleeper in the primary room
That said, the primary room bed was SO comfortable. We slept great and the fan kept the room cool. I have a kid that sleeps HOT and their room (with the loft) got a little toasty but the AC cooled down the house quickly.
Owners responded within minutes when I had a technical issue with the front door."

The location is so so but I think once all their renovations on the houses nearby are done it will be good. The recycling center is very noisy starting at 630 am so that might be an issue for someone wanting to sleep in.

The place is immaculate and I couldn't have been happier with my stay. The host did inform me prior to my stay about the properties on either side. They are a little run down but theu are actively working to clean them up and make the area better.
The ONLY negative I have is there is a recycling place behind the house and they start early. But this is not something controlled by the host and doesn't affect my rating for the location.
I would 1000% stay here again!"

Stayed one night","The place itself was the absolute cutest place I’ve stayed. The best decorated and well thought out. Very welcoming hosts.
All that said, while it was pretty, the mattress is rock hard and I could not sleep. I’m not asking for a temperpedic or anything, but I would like to not feel like I’m sleeping on a wood floor. Renting an Airbnb has one purpose, and that is to have a place to rest. I had to be up there for one evening, and since I had to get up at 3:45 AM to drive back for work the next day, I wanted a place to sleep to avoid falling asleep on the road back. I maybe got 2 hours of sleep because of the mattress.
There are no curtains, so I also felt like people could look though the windows. There are blinds, just not that added security of curtains.
Being by myself, I didn’t feel safe in that neighborhood.
Again, super duper cute— just didn’t serve the purpose of rest that I desperately needed and missed out on for the rest of the work week."

Stayed one night","The house was spotless!! So clean, smelled so nice!! Decor was wonderful, brand new consturction! One of the best air b&bs we have stayed as far as the actual home was concerned. It was located in an older part of town and the owners have purchased the two lots on each side of the super cute house. The lots have vacant houses on them at this time. The host did message me the day before our arrival to let me know what to expect when we arrived. I probably would have felt at ease if my husband would have been with me, but this trip was just for my daughter and I. I would definitely stay here again if my husband were along for the trip. It will be super nice when the homes next to this house are finished :)"

The arrangement is weird because the bedroom didn’t had any bathroom so I had to walk across the hall just to use the toilet.
I wouldn’t recommend this room to anyone because you won’t have any peaceful sleep."

Mind you it was 35 degrees outside and when I reached out to the host, they said I could turn the heat up to 65 degrees and then during the middle of the night another guest turned the air conditioner back on to 62 degrees.
Great value for the price but being a heated blanket for the winter time."

Hoping for a relaxing hot shower after a long day (finally getting in around 9pm) and I wanted to get out almost immediately. I asked the host directly if she was planning on changing the showerhead and she ignored my question completely after reading it. So I assume that to mean, no. :) Other than that minor irritation, the stay was excellent."

Stayed one night","A few months ago, we stayed at an airbnb in Stillwater that was actually a hotel. lt did not meeting our expectations and I hoped this airbnb was better.
Man, this airbnb was 100% better. We stayed in the Rustic Cottage and it was perfect for our stay. It was clean and cozy. The neighborhood is fine and its so convenient. The complimentary water, coffee, and eating utensils all came in handy. We will definitely be staying back. The bed, it was so soft and comfortable. We actually slept painfree and wish we could've slept longer, therefore, my only recommendation is if you stay to bring a sleeping mask, which we will do next time. Otherwise, as soon as the sun comes up, you're up too.
Book this airbnb if in Stillwater."

Please be respectful of other guests trying to sleep!

Depending on the room you rent you may have a private bath. We didn’t and knew that, had zero issues even though there were others sharing the bathroom too. But if you don’t want to I would say look at the rooms and get one that has its own."

Sound machines have been placed to attempt to drown out noise. This room has a separate kitchen space with a Keurig coffee pot and small fridge. Bed was comfortable. Plug-ins aren’t very accessible.

It was a room with two beds as advertised. There are 2 shared restrooms (one with a shower) for all the rooms. The room we had was close to the front door and across from bathroom. The room door did little to filter the hallway noise. Not a huge issue as we use white noise on our phones at night to sleep. Even with white noise, we were easily able to hear activity in the hallway.
Everything was clean and it worked for a 1 night stay."

Before our arrival I was skeptical because I had never stayed in a setting like this before but our stay was wonderful and really opened me up to looking for rooms instead of houses from now on.
The communication with Tammy was very timely. The privacy was remarkable, everyone stayed to themselves and wasn't loud! We stayed in the White Country Cottage.
When looking for a place to stay we will certainly look for this Tammy's openings first. Thank you for being a wonderful host we look forward to staying again!!"

Stayed one night","This is a room with a shared bathroom (1 1/2 bathrooms) with 2 more rooms available to rent. The pictures and description of our room were accurate. The room could have been cleaner especially the floor, which needed to be vacuumed. Two large fluorescent lights were on the ceiling in the bedroom. I thought this was a poor choice for lighting. The rooms and bathrooms were located in a long dark hallway. It is located in a business area.
On the night we stayed, there were people banging on the main door at 11:30 p.m. Then, later in the night there were several people standing at the main door entrance , talking loudly and laughing. A little after that I heard someone trying to open the door to our room. I opened the door and they said that the room that we were in was the same room that they booked and that the owner must have double booked it. It was a terrible night."

But because of the location, I can walk 10-15 minutes to the art museum, and the history museum. It's on main Street in less than five minutes. It's amazing. It said is half bathroom, in fact you can use the whole bathroom and toilet if you tell Tammy.It's very private. I highly recommend this house if you go to Stillwater！！"

Stayed a few nights","Stayed 5 nights total.
Kiersten was over-the-top on customer service. She worked with me on my indefinite booking dates due to the uncertainty of my grandson's birth. She even quickly readied the place for just one night when the birth time was later in the day than I thought.
Then, I returned 2 weeks later to help out with new baby and finish the remaining 4 nights. She even let me see the place a month or two before since I was staying many nights.
My multiple questions she answered quickly and when there was a need while I was there, she was johnny on the spot, going the extra mile.
The only item those who stay may want to know is there is no garbage disposal, in case you plan to cook alot. That did not affect me as I ate at my daughter's or had take out.
Another plus was the new washer/dryer, which was handy as I washed many loads for my daughter's machine which was on the blink.
A house-infused subtle, calming scent each day was welcomed.
Thank you. I will stay again."

Stayed one night","Entering the property, my boyfriend was instantly impressed (that says a lot)!! Lol. We are both really picky about where we lay our heads. Even more so, since COVID…We never felt like we couldn’t be comfortable in the home. The house has nice relaxing energy, with kind of a rustic feel, clean, and well kept. Toiletries, pots, pans, cleaning, and washing supplies are all provided. This cute little house has everything your heart could desire!! The neighbors in the area, on the other hand, were kinda sketch.. they watched us a lot, whenever loading our vehicle or retrieving our food deliveries.. but, that has absolutely nothing to do with the host!! She was great!! She personalized our experience and we had such a relaxing time. Thanks so much!! This will be our pick above hotels when we just want to experience quiet time, alone in the city. We will definitely return. This staycation was exactly what we needed!! 5 stars for the host, the house, and the amenities!! 3 stars for the area and neighbors… either way, we enjoyed ourselves and so can you and your loved one.. book asap and please respect the property! This is truly a HIDDEN GEM in Stillwater, Oklahoma!!"
