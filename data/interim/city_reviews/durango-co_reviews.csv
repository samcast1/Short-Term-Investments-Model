Stayed with a pet","We absolutely loved our stay here! Kati was a wonderful host, very kind and responsive. Our trip had some last minute changes and she was flexible and understanding in our check in/out times - we appreciated it so much!
The airbnb itself was so sweet and cozy, us and our dog loved the peaceful, quiet property and watching the chickens and deer! Definitely coming back to this lovely spot next time I'm in town :)"

Stayed a few nights",This place is so adorable. It was great. It was clean and just perfect for someone on a budget. This was our first Airbnb and Kati made it a great experience. We had trouble with hot water for the shower and she immediately came to help us out. The hut doesn’t have ac but it has plenty of windows for air circulation and she even gave us a fan to use. We also got to see two does which was nice. The wifi was great and the portable bathroom was clean as well. Only cons are the outside shower could use a bit more privacy since it felt like the neighbors could see you. Also the little wall way was bit narrow. Sink inside the hut only had cold water.The parking spot she originally wanted us to park was to narrow for rav4. Even with this conns they felt like you could work around it. Kati really did make our stay great and honestly would love to come back. Plus the bed was amazing to sleep in. Kati is also extremely responsive and did an amazing job accommodating us! Definitely recommend it.

Stayed a few nights","This was a great airbnb! I had to go to Durango, Colorado for a 2 day work trip & this was the perfect place for me to stay. Kati is very kind, helpful, & responsive. The flower hut was very cute & perfect for a lonely traveler like myself. Would definitely stay here again if work brings me back to the area."

Stayed one night","If you want to be away from the hustle & bustle from busy, hectic life...then Kati's place is ideal. Living on a farm myself, I felt right at home with her friendly chickens, and beautiful calm quiet surroundings.
advice: when you pull up, your beautifully decorated, lovely art work filled private little hide-away is located FRONT OF the PROPERTY, to the LEFT. Not the building or house right up front or the home in the far back. Just stay L- not hard to find. Thanks Kati for the clean porta-potty!
note: folks, if your wanting hotel-style extras, close to shopping & restaurants, look elsewhere. But if you crave-peace, nature, back to basics...then I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS HIDDEN LIL GEM‼️"

Stayed one night","Katie was quickly responsive and thoughtful. The room was just as described. Nice selection of coffee and teas.
The outside shower is fun and kind of edgy, early in the morning. The chickens are entertaining. The rooster is noisy like all roosters. That is his job. And I grew up on a farm, so it didn’t bother me!"

The room is charming and comfortable, and we enjoyed being wakened by the rooster. This truly is glamping, and so much more fun than a generic room somewhere."

I did not have the pleasure to meet her in person unfortunately, but I definitely enjoyed the stay and hope to stay again. The place is exactly as described. Funky and cozy. Comforter is so soft and she even left tea and goodies for the guests - so sweet! One thing I would like to note is that you do have to walk through a dirt path to the flower hub and the port-a potty is a bit of a walk too. Not a big deal unless it’s raining - just something to keep in mind."

The kitchen was fantastic and we enjoyed comfy living room at the end of the day to watch a movie on the smart tv. The location was the best part. Just steps from the Main Street of downtown but far enough to be quiet at night. We were there for a long weekend and always found free parking in the lot across the street. Would definitely stay here again the next time we’re in Durango!

The kitchen was amazing and huge, and I really appreciated the gas stove! The place has plenty of space.
We loved how easy it was to walk everywhere in downtown. Parking was a little tricky but not bad. The covered parking a couple blocks away was great our last night when it snowed. Also, it was a very easy drive to Purgatory to ski.

The kitchen was well stocked with everything we needed and the living room (which turns into a 3rd bedroom) was very cozy. Trent was quick to respond to a few things that came up which was much appreciated. A great spot for sure!

Stayed with kids","For Durango, this location is perfect. It’s situated literally steps from the main drag, with walkable access to all the shops and restaurants.
As for the space itself, it was very comfortable, clean, and cozy. All the amenities you’ll need are there, and everything was modern and updated. Trent was very responsive as well.
There are only two “cons” I would mention, (and they’re not deal breakers):
Parking is a little complicated (the reserved spaces are a block or two away), but that comes with the territory when the location is so convenient.
The front steps can be a little treacherous in icy weather, as the gutter empties directly onto them.
Either of these shouldn’t be a major issue unless a member of your party has difficulty walking.
Other than that, a very pleasant experience, and definitely a recommendation from me."

But, you are steps away from restaurants, a winery, bars, and shops. The home was built in the late 1800s but it has been beautifully remodeled with an open kitchen and dining room space, and a very comfortable living room. The bookshelf has many great book titles that I wish I had had time to sit and read during my stay."

We stayed in the downstairs apartment and found the location to be very walkable to the main street of Durango. We were close to restaurants, breweries, and shopping. The hosts were able to provide us with some great recommendations. They were super responsive when we may, or may have not, tripped a breaker in the middle of a blizzard. They quickly came out in the poor weather to access and fix the issue that was present. They were responsive to us throughout the booking process and the stay. I cannot say enough good things about them. 10/10 would recommend."

Stayed a few nights","Located in downtown Durango, across from City Hall, and within walking distance to everything that is Main Street Durango- eateries, shopping and the train station! My two teens walked over to the nearby ice-creamery a few times (which is a must try). Reserved parking is a few blocks away. Otherwise, there is metered parking directly in front of the home and free parking across the street at City Hall during designated times.
Contemporary renovations with a beautiful kitchen, plenty of hot water, a comfy separate lounging area to relax with family for games, movie night, or to read a book.
Books and a variety of board games are provided. Standard kitchen amenities, hair care products and dryer, and extra pillows and blankets are available. It is part of an upstairs/downstairs duplex, we were downstairs. The way it is designed you really do not encounter the upstairs tenants although you can lightly hear them walking around.
Trent is excellent at communicating and has a good response time too.
Overall, we had a great stay and would definitely stay again!"

Durango is BEAUTIFUL.
We booked this place after an unexpected event led us to leave Farmington, NM last minute.
One night was all it took to fall in love with the beautifully remodeled space.
Clean, modern, cozy.
We were so eager to check in that a small hiccup in the check in process almost crushed our dreams. However, the host was able to assist us and it was worth every penny!
Parking is a bit tricky but you don’t even mind since everything is walking distance. The host gives you detailed instructions on where you are able to park!
You can’t beat the views from all the around the home.
Beautiful kitchen, well- equipped, and just an overall cozy space.
I loved it so much, I am planning my next trip to Durango and I hope to be given the privilege of renting this space out again."

Easy walking down to Main Street and easy walking to explore the incredible architecture in the old Durango neighborhoods. We never even got in our car during our stay. The place is beautiful! We ate out every meal (great restaurants in Durango) but the kitchen was big and nice and would be perfect for cooking in. It has a large dining table and island. The 2 bedrooms had super comfortable beds and the bathroom was great too. The house also has an extra room that is used as a TV room with a couch. For sure could be used for sleeping. Very spacious home! Loved every single thing about it. Definitely one of the best AirBNB's I've stayed in! I'll be back 100%!

Nice dining area with large table seating six. The main living room facing the street is large as well and there are board games and a library selection. Big screen tv w Netflix too! Excellent communication throughout stay. Easy check-in. Prompt response from hosts. Near grocery and pharmacy and Main St dining and pubs. Great spot all around. Highly recommend! -Steve C of Utley, TX."

Walking distance to City Market and all the shopping. Parking was a slight concern when we got there, but hosts made it simple by giving 4 different parking options - all very very close! I cannot recommend this unit enough."

We also enjoyed the large kitchen and dining which we enjoyed cooking in. Family area has great large windows that let plenty of light in. Hosts are friendly and easy to work with. Option to include upstairs too, we didn't try this time, but maybe on our next trip to Durango with more friends."

Here’s the parking heads up …..
You can only park in front of the building if you pay the meter like $1.00 an hour with a 3 hour maximum time, But you can also stay in that spot after 6:00 pm it’s free until next day by 7:00 am and pay the meter specially when you’re checking out, or you can park 2 blocks away for free"

Stayed a few nights","This is a lovely, well-decorated, spotlessly clean home that has been converted into 2 apartments (upstairs & downstairs - this is the downstairs unit - you may hear footsteps of upstairs tenant. Not too bothersome). Location is perfect - walking distance to everything.
Parking is a bit of a pain, but that is not the fault of the owners - Durango has parking meter enforcement that will catch you within 2 minutes of overstaying your meter. Just know that going in.
Beds are on the firm side. Shower is a rain shower head - lovely. Even though you’re right close to downtown, noise is not really a problem at all. Train sounds during the day, churchbells are charming, and good windows keep out most of the rest.
Listing says sleeps six. Six adults in this space would be quite cozy. Our group of four was just fine, however."

Love the easy access for self checkin, guaranteed parking spot is so helpful downtown, and just in general it is a good location. Couldn’t recommend it enough for someone looking for a fun stay in Durango!"

Parking space is nearby and very welcome. I was in town to see relatives, but the condo would be great for someone who wants to make the best of what the town has to offer."

Due to my confusion as to our checkout date, we didn’t check out on time. The hosts reached out to us and we had to scramble our afternoon plans but we managed to clear out just as the cleaners were there for the next guest.
My point here is that the hosts were extremely patient, helpful and understanding once they discovered my error.

Stayed a few nights","The unit was as described: close (meaning right downtown), quiet (well, the condo next door was having some remodeling done, but that was only periodic during daytime), and comfortable. Travelling alone, I don't need too many extras, but when I decided to cook dinner the final night, everything I need to prep the meal was there.
Their description indicates it's close to everything downtown. Very true, literally steps away from Main Street, which offers easy walking access to restaurants, shops, chocolate and, of course, the scenic railroad. Durango has lots of outdoor activities available (none of which I did because it was cold and I was lazy), so Robby and Kristen's place can be a good one for 1-2 travelers.
Thanks for letting me visit."

All of the utensils you would need to cook a meal were in the kitchen (although we did not). The bed was very comfortable, but like the previous reviews said, the frame will get ya (we just put towels on the posts). The instructions for access and parking were very well communicated. There is a coin laundry on premises, but they were not working well. Coffee was provided (a very nice touch). If you are planning on going all the time and just need a place to drop and go, I highly recommend this wonderful rental."

The private parking spot was a huge plus too. Amenities in the apartment are good for a cozy studio. The shampoos & soaps were a nice touch in the spacious walk in shower. And the local coffee in the freezer was appreciated. This apartment was very clean, except for a weird smell coming from the garbage disposal (the last guests didn’t flip the switch so there were food bits stinking up the studio initially…the switch is behind the coffee machine for future guests). We definitely loved the location of this spot especially if you want to have a home base for all of the day trips you can do in and around Durango."

The space Eric has created is so comfortable, peaceful, spacious, open and private at the same time. He has put wonderful attention and discernment into the reclaimed and eclectic furnishings, as well as the art pieces.
Everything works well in the space, and Eric has been wonderfully responsive and supportive. Will definitely return!"

A fawn welcomed us upon our arrival.
Eric messaged us daily to see if we needed anything. Running low on coffee? That afternoon a fresh bag of organic coffee was waiting at our door.
We highly recommend Eric’s Inner Galaxy. I’d wondered about the name. It’s tied to the location, and the stars at night are amazing!"

Cozy, inviting, comfortable, thoughtful design touches, quiet and beautiful setting, great location, and superior cleanliness. On top of that, Eric is a welcoming host who is responsive and full of recommendations to help you get the most out of your visit to Durango. The bed and bedding were extremely comfortable. The shower was amazing (spacious, great pressure, very clean). The kitchen was very basic, and I don’t know that I would have been able to cook much, but we had no plans to cook because we love eating out in Durango. I will definitely be recommending a stay at the Inner Galaxy House to anyone I know who is heading to Durango, and I look forward to my next stay!"

Artfully furnished in an eclectic combination of old and new, Eric's place was perfect for our holiday ski trip. Close enough to walk to food and action, but tucked away enough to see deer in the yard. Loved making our own breakfast in the kitchen area that had everything we needed and eating at the table surrounded by windows w/lots of natural lighting and great views of nature. QUIET! The king-sized bed was uber-comfy and the bathroom was modern w/natural stone tile in tub/shower area. Only regret is not having enough time to hang out on the comfy couch and watch a movie or read a book. Just have to go back! Eric is a SUPER-HELPFUL host w/good taste in coffee...appreciated having enough for that first morning as we had forgotten to bring ours. It's the little things that count."

Stayed a few nights","The Galaxy house was PERFECT. Not only was Eric flexible with check in and check out for me due to some of my circumstances, he was always communicative and asked if things were going alright or if i needed anything extra. He really knows how to be a great host. The views were INCREDIBLE from every angle of the home, the natural light was amazing, the space is clean and quiet, location is minutes to town and many options within walking distance to eat. I brought bikes with me and I was able to keep them inside the house since it was really spacious. The bed is really comfortable and lots of storage space in the bedroom. AND I saw deer out near the windows early in the morning! I really enjoyed having my coffee and wine on the private patio overlooking a mountain ridge, surrounded by trees. Eric even left me some tea and coffee to try. I’ll DEFINITELY be back here when I visit Durango again. 10 out of 10 stars, I’m still blown away by this stay. Thank you!"

His place is nestled among the trees so you feel like you are in the middle of the forest listening to birds sing and watching the deer graze. The decor is unique and cozy. Very close proximity to downtown. We had a quiet, peaceful getaway and look forward to coming back very soon."

Stayed a few nights",Eric's home was a perfect spot for a weekend trip. It is very close to skiing (30 min) and downtown (6 min). We were there when there was a huge snow storm and the roads to his house were already plowed and made it very easy to get to. The big bonus was to see wildlife outside your window at all times of day and night! I would definitely recommend staying here during your time in Durango!

Encased in John and Toshikos’ place-
From the nest in the tree-
To the ducks in the creek-
All cares from the world erased-
Magical- momentous-
The palette of colors on display-
Fresh daffodils so strikingly yellow-
While fresh greenery of springtime buds-
Give in to the breeze at bay-
The sound of the creek was enticing-
Leading to blissful sleep-
Refreshed, renewed and invigorated-
These memories we shall always -
Forever keep……
Thank you John and Toshiko for sharing the splendor of your place. It truly was a remarkable time!"

Located creekside, at the end of a private road far from the highway, we could watch the creek rippling by and marvel at the snow covered cliff sides right out the big picture window from the warm comfort of the place. Our hosts were super nice and accommodating when we needed a slightly later arrival due to a late flight into Durango. There’s a friendly breakfast place not far away, and Durango is just a short 15 minute drive. So you get the best of isolated peace and quiet and access to all the recreational and dining opportunities in the area. On top of that, the kitchen is well appointed if you just want to relax and stay in. Definitely recommended!"

Stayed a few nights","If you are looking for a retreat space, just outside of Durango, this is a beautiful space right on a creek. The view was absolutely amazing and we saw deer every day which we loved. It’s a small space, so not really suited for more than two people, but the place was beautiful and nicely finished. The only challenge we had is that it’s really a place to come for peace and quiet and I guess because of the weather, the owners were using their riding mower to suck up leaves every day we were there. That spoiled some of the peace and quiet for us, but they did stop on the third day when we finally ask them to. This place is probably best suited if you’re going to stay there quite a bit because otherwise it’s a 15 minute drive into Durango."

While we've stayed at numerous properties across the country and especially in Durango, this absolutely is set apart.
We spent most of our days busy with various destinations and activities in the area. However, this is truly a place you could stay and relax and never leave for your entire visit. We enjoyed the views, listening to the creek and the elk bugling at night.
Another highlight was the gallery.
I highly recommend scheduling a time to view it. The owners are accomplished artist, and have studied, trained, and taught art across the entire world.
We actually saved our visit to the gallery for our last day and viewing the art was a perfect way complete our trip.
Thank you so much toJohn and Toshiko

Stayed a few nights","We LOVED staying at Toshiko and John's cozy and comfortable studio. Yes, Toshiko, the view sitting in the comfy chairs at the picture window is simply breathtaking. We loved sitting there watching and listening to the rushing creek. In fact, we made a point to get up early to drink our coffee at the window and to get home early enough to have a cocktail back in our favorite chairs!
The studio was clean and provided us with everything we needed. Toshiko assured us that we just needed to ask for anything we might need.
The location was perfect - we easily drove to Mesa Verde National Park for our first day - the drive there and back was breathtaking! The following day we spent in and around Durango. We got in a fabulous 2 hour horseback ride with Over the Hill Outfitters that started on the outskirts of Durango and quickly got us up in to the foothills. We successfully went cowboy boot shopping and birded a nearby reservoir, before getting back home to watch the sunset. Perfect!"

I wish I could give it more than 5 stars. Nothing is left out. They share their beautiful place and their beautiful souls. Their home, artistic ability, family and love for the beauty of nature makes this place a complete package. They are two of the best people we have ever had the pleasure of meeting. God laid the foundation and they perfected it."

This lovely cabin is secluded, but only a short drive to town. The cabin was well stocked with all the comforts of home. John and Toshiko thought of every little thing a guest might need. The gallery was astounding and is a must-see. John and Toshiko were wonderful hosts; very friendly and attentive. I can't wait to come back. Thank you, thank you thank you!"

The studio was beautiful and fully stocked with everything we needed and worked great for our family of 4. Note that there is just a hotplate for cooking however this worked just fine for us.

John & Toshiko communicated all of the important information to us ahead of time and Toshiko greeted us at check in from the garden, which is clearly a labor of love. The value in this Airbnb comes from the riverside setting, which can be enjoyed from the thoughtful seating areas and multiple vantage points. The guest house has a lovely picture window, well-equipped kitchenette and a comfortable queen bed, but we wouldn’t recommend using the sofa bed as a second bed option. If you’re looking for a weekend getaway with easy access to the Durango Hot Springs and James Ranch Grill, this is a great option."

Stayed a few nights","The studio on this property is absolutely beautiful. It had just what we needed to reset and relax…. a comfortably firm bed, hot shower, and stunning views. About 15 minutes north of Durango, we were close to everything we wanted to see and do. With such idyllic surroundings, we slept peacefully and had plenty of energy to hike and explore. The property itself felt like something out of a painting…. Soft grass, flowers in bloom, that stream running right outside of the studio…and had several comfortable places to just sit and enjoy nature all around you.
The only thing I should point out is the kitchen, while well equipped otherwise, has only a hot plate for cooking. It didn’t bother us, ( there’s a restaurant across the road and a small market 5 min away), but if you are planning on doing a lot of cooking on your trip, it’s something to consider.
I cannot recommend this place enough, and hope to return soon.
Thank you John and Toshiko for allowing us to enjoy a small slice of the paradise you have created!"

These visitors will be walking around the property, including around the outside of the Airbnb. To include the private deck/patio which faces the owners house, as well as the picture window of the Airbnb that faces the river. You see, the gallery is attached to the Airbnb so they have to go in front of the Airbnb. Additionally, there is no direct lighting in the entire Airbnb. If you like to look in a mirror to see your face or possibly put on make-up, forget about it."

As we pulled in, Toshiko greeted us with smiles and good vibes. She was as happy to see us, as we were to her. She gave us a tour and was willing to answer any questions we had for her. She was very welcoming and friendly to someone who is somewhat new to airbnb.
You have the entire tiny home to yourself. A ton of privacy and everything you need. A kitchen with a fridge and many items you can use to cook breakfast lunch and dinner. She provided an electric kettle and tea for you to use. I was even able to make my morning smoothie with the provided blender.
The bathroom was up to date and gorgeous. Towels and toiletries were provided which was great.
The living area and bed was very comfortable. The fireplace immediately warmed up the entire place.
Your vehicle will be locked inside a gated area which feels very safe. Especially if you have bikes on your vehicle.
Best of all was the window with a view of the mountains and stream. This alone will get me to stay again. View this from inside the home or along side the stream with provided chairs. They even have a hammock if you enjoy that too.
The provided pictures do not do any justice to this home. I saw the pics and then the home in person and was blown away by the choice I made.
I'm sorry but I cannot pick any downsides to this home. Everything was great and well worth it!"

The bathroom is clean and Libby provided the basic toiletries and the kitchenette is well stocked with spices, utensils, coffee and tea.
The queen size bed was comfy with clean linen. There’s a small creek that runs behind the cabin even though it was dry during our stay. The surrounding area is very quiet since it’s a residential area even though neighbors are spread quite apart. About an eight minute drive to downtown Durango and with plenty of restaurants, cafes, and gift shops.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and can recommend to anyone without any reservation."

Stayed one night","I am traveling from Missoula, Montana to San Miguel de Allende, Mexico and what nailed the reservation for me was having ""The Untethered Soul"" in her library. Anyone who has that book is a friend of mine. But it was much more!! She has everything a person needs and it's in a perfect space for one person and a small dog! I guess it would be good for a couple too, but I'm one person with a dog! It smells so good. No chemical Tide/Downy stink! All her spices are organic. Himalayan salt. Tea and Coffee. The refrigerator door had so many useful things when having take out or cooking for yourself. I enjoyed the peaceful early morning light and making coffee. The shower head is one of those amazing top end that feels like one is under a waterfall. I wouldn't expect that in a shack! I'd love to come back every year. Loved it! Terry"

Sitting right on a beautiful little creek with a large private side yard and funky covered space with a wooden porch swing, the outdoor space alone was awesome. (Sitting outside listening to the rain on that tin roof was divine!) The ""Bunny Shack"" itself is adorable, inside and out. It's positively dripping with character, and Libby's thoughtful decorating with an eye toward comfort and delight is off the charts. It's a tiny space, but thoughtful design and decoration actually make it feel quite large -- and definitely homey. Have you ever been to a rental that has deluxe (sharp!) knives in the kitchen?! From the collection of gourmet teas, coffees + snacks to the ultra comfy bed with rolling storage underneath to the thoughtful book selection and charming artwork, I was delighted to stay here and definitely will again.

Also the outdoor area/yard surrounding the cabin could use some sprucing and picking up. There’s old metal and wood being stored there as well as a run down workshop and if this was picked up and made to look more cozy, it would add to the experience more. Location to town was great and loved being on the creek."

Stayed about a week","Absolutely perfect place for us! Exactly as delightful as described by the many other 5 star reviewers who've enjoyed Maebunny's.
Billie and Pippy, the small and the tall, are the friendliest dogs ever, but never pests. The shack had everything we needed and nothing we didn't, supremely clean, and the almost magical location: literally 5 minutes from downtown Durango, yet nestled within trees, birds, butterflies, with the sound of the water in the creek running behind the shack. Cars passing on the road mere whispers. The deep country experience just minutes from food, drink, rafting, etc.
Libby was low-key and friendly, responded to questions immediately, couldn't ask for a better host. We left a personal item behind and she was kind enough to mail it back to us.
I'd give 10 stars if I could. Would love to return!"

The small size made it so cozy, and was very well put together! This one had everything we needed, from TV, music, a small stove and dishes, and lots of extra special touches that made our stay very comfortable. The sound of the stream was magnificent and the location was perfect and super close to downtown Durango! It was a perfect start for our road trip, and we would love to stay again!"

The place was very clean, had all the essentials and nice touches of complementary items. I appreciated that the products were natural and/or organic. We did not get to use the outdoor space as it was raining on our one night, but the area by the creek looked cute. There is a fairly busy road right next to the property but the traffic noise was not bad inside the cabin. The location is great, little outside of the main part of town so quieter but a quick drive to everything Durango has to offer."

Stayed with a pet","MaeBunny was just as described and perfectly fit our needs for a two night stay while in Durango. The location was great; less than 10 min to main street and a skip away from the Colorado Trail, trailhead!
Communication was just right and check in was easy. The ""shack"" was clean and included several thoughtful amenities.
We greatly appreciated that pets are allowed too.
We will definitely book again if in the area. Five star, thank you!"

Stayed with kids","This was exactly what we expected. The bathroom has been updated to a porta-loo since the listing was created, which was a welcome improvement. If you stay here when it's cold at night just make sure you turn that space heater on asap! I unfortunately waited too long and was uncomfortable for longer than I needed to be. I arrived late at night and my son was already asleep so I didn't get to settle in before putting him in bed, and it was hard for me to find the heater under the circumstance. With that said, I do NOT recommend staying here if you might be arriving late at night. This is ideally a place you want to adapt to before night falls (like when you go camping!). All in all, I appreciated the accomodations and would certainly stay here again."

Listing is as described, so don't expect the most luxurious amenities, but for those that enjoy yurts and simpler living type stays, its a great find. Being only 15 minutes to everything in Durango is also a really nice advantage to have, so if you wanted to add some more social activities to your agenda, it makes a great launching point without being too far away. Would recommend an extra blanket for those visiting in the winter months, but beyond that it lives up to expectations and is a great experience."

The kitchen was very well equipped and easy to navigate. Each cabin on the property had its own dog run, which made it easy to bring a dog(s) as well as lent a very dog-friendly vibe. We came to snowboard and enjoy Purgatory Mountain, less than a half hour away from the cabin. Vita was a very communicative host and made sure the check-in and check-out went smoothly. I forgot something in the cabin when we left and Vita responded immediately to my inquiry. We would return to this cabin rental in the future because it has the perfect combination of ongoing upkeep as well as a responsive host. Shelley"

Couldn't get the windows on the west side over the dining table open which may have helped with a better breeze. Evenings were cool and quiet. Other than that, all was comfortable and clean. The Internet was spotty but I think the evening before we left they (Spectrum) upgraded the system. But it wasn't that important to us. Even being off a main road, it was pretty quiet. Cute cabin.

For a weekend getaway, it was exactly where we wanted to be- close to hot springs and Purgatory ski resort, Honeyville, and about a 15 minute drive from North City Market and friends in Durango. PJs Market in Hermosa is also a great place to pick up supplies (or in our case, our friend's birthday cake!). Cabin #3 was so cozy and pet friendly. It would be a family-friendly cabin as well. Great place to cook and sack out watch movies after a day of venturing in the local area. Loved the gas fireplace. It was an epic stay and we will certainly be back for more- her chateau would be great rain or shine!"

Stayed a few nights","The cabin itself was really well equipped and clean. We enjoyed the fun arcade game, the smart TV and full kitchen. We did however have an incident with the neighbors on the property. The cabin sits on a lot with a few more airbnbs all managed by the same person. Because of this we ran into limited parking and unfortunately a loud party next door. Although it was not the owners fault I think it might have been nice to know the rest of the properties on site were airbnbs as well and all in close proximity to our Airbnb. If your looking for a more private cabin, I would probably look elsewhere.
The location was great, in Hermosa in between Durango and purgatory ski resort."

The kitchen has nice dishes and eating utensils. Yes, Route 550 is a little close but it is not too noisy. The other cabins are far enough away that you hardly notice any other guests. Pictures are accurate and communication was excellent. We would stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","Do not book this cabin until you understand there is no privacy (several cabins in close proximity) and the location is sandwiched between private property and the highway - so you have to get in your car to do anything - ride bikes, walk or go for a run.
With no AC, it gets very hot in the summer months and some windows were missing screens and other windows cannot open so limited ability for fresh air into the cabin. An extremely small fan was in a closet, but way too small to allow for any relief of the heat. Very disappointing and we did not stay. We rebooked immediately and found an amazing site just a few miles away. As of this posting, I have not received any refund since Vita seems to think it’s up to Airbnb to decide this."

It is close to the road but we really didn't notice any noise and the surroundings are so scenic. It was a perfect spot for exploring Durango and day trip to Silverton. We hope to come back. It was clean and well equiped. We couldn't get the gas fireplace going but there was some electic space radiator heater so it wasn't an issue at all. The check in and out process couldn't be easier. I have no hesitation in recommending. (I think better suited to a couple, might be a bit crowded for a family)."

Stayed about a week","It is a modular house. Big enough for the three of us. Our dog was welcome - huge plus. Owner and agent were very fast to respond - great service. On a slightly negative side - location is ok, but not great. Next to 550 - hear cars passing by if windows are opened. Need to have a car even for a walk - no easy access to river and/or trails. We also thought that it was overpriced a bit. Otherwise it was a good spring break stay."

Stayed with kids",We really enjoyed our stay here! The location was perfect as it was pretty much right in between Purgatory Ski Resort and downtown Durango. The cabin was cozy and just the right size for our family of 4. The kids had never seen the old school table arcade before and they though that was “super cool”. Kitchen was pretty well stocked. We couldn’t figure out how to get the fireplace going but we didn’t need it because the space heaters warmed the space well enough. Overall great place and would stay again!

Stayed with kids","This place was really great for our family of 4 plus 1 doggo! I feel the need to tell every detail because we enjoyed it so much. First, the communication as outstanding. The day before we arrived, I asked if there was a grill. The property manager said he'd bring one over. There was a new grill waiting for us with grill utensils when we arrived. We were also sent exact coordinations to the house, but found it easily with the address. The house has a small fenced in back years that was perfect for our doggo. There is also what looks to be a garden in the summer that fascinated our 4 and 2 year olds. We'd love to come back when it's warmer and utilize fresh herbs or veggies! the bed was very comfortable with plenty of pillows. There was a small heater in the bedroom that warmed the space well, as it did get chilly at night! In the living room, there is a fireplace that I assume was gas. Very simple to turn on and off with a remote, and kept the whole cabin toasty. The kitchen was a small and efficient space, with a gas stove (which I love and prefer). We have young kids, so we really appreciated the sturdy and solid furniture, which was a beautiful wood. There were some really great touches in the cabin, including games, like Connect 4, several books, and, my husband's favorite, an arcade game with pac-man, Gallagher, dig out and others. There is also a washing machine that is a washer/dryer combo, which, to this point, I've only seen in Europe and South America. The space was very clean! Even my extremely picky husband commented on how clean it was. There was a locked closet that I assume had cleaning supplies in it, but we didn't have access, so if you want to clean up after yourself, plan to bring some disinfectant wipes. There is a really great deck on the front to enjoy the beautiful mountain scenery. While other houses are close by, the cabin does sit on a quiet back dirt road that was so nice to let the kids run on, and walk Teddy Roosevelt (the dog). As discussed in the description, you are exactly 12 miles to town, and apparently about the same to Purgatory, as the other rental property looked to have winter sporters staying. Easily a 5 star stay. My husband travels to Durango several times a year for work, and this will likely be our go-to whenever it's available!"

Sarah, the host, is very friendly, responsive and helpful. We stayed for my son’s birthday and I mentioned that to her, so there was a birthday gift for him waiting when we got there. :) I’ve never had an air b&b host go above and beyond like that.

The lights in the Polar Express room were also a fun touch! Close to anything you’d want to do, but still felt like our own private getaway. Anything you need is already there, and instructions are clearly marked so we didn’t have to “figure anything out.” And who doesn’t love a nice warm (CLEAN) hot tub!! I sincerely hope we can come again, Sarah and her family are top notch - don’t hesitate to rent anything from them!!! Thank you Sarah, from the bottom of our hearts!!!"

Sarah’s recommendations led us to the best meal we have had (Primus) and a beautiful trail I had not found on the AllTrails app. We were close enough to town while still having the privacy and space of living outside of town. Perfect stay!

My wife really appreciated the thoughtful details—the host set up a wonderful coffee bar and had coffee creamer and eggs in the refrigerator. Our dogs also had welcome treats. The beds were comfortable and the outdoor patio was a great gathering place to eat and relax. We’ll definitely be back.

We also received a thoughtful welcome basket filled with local chocolates and tea. The refrigerator was stocked with cold local beer, and the bathrooms had high-quality toiletries. Sarah even provided amenities for our fur baby, Max. The place had everything we needed, including a hot tub, games, foosball, cornhole, and a large TV with DVDs. Although we didn't use the ping pong table, the fire pit was perfect for roasting marshmallows and making S’mores (even during a heatwave). Downtown Durango was a short drive away, offering even more activities. It was a perfect retreat for our entire family, thanks to Sarah's exceptional hospitality and attention to detail."

It’s close enough to Durango that the drive into town is easy but also the drive to Purgatory is a little closer than if you stayed in downtown Durango. The metal bunk beds were super sturdy and didn’t make a lot of noise like some metal beds do. We came in July and the AC units upstairs really helped in the afternoons to beat the heat but we turned them off when we slept and it was great! The downstairs stayed really cool despite the heat and we loved the back porch! My kids loved the scavenger hunt clues! Thanks for the chocolate, fresh eggs and beer. We would stay again!"

We were worried about the weather and it almost made us cancel our trip, but Sarah was helpful in sharing what was going on in the local area and sharing her expertise on fire hazards and safety since she is used to living in the mountains. We appreciate her hospitality!!
Also - the games at the house were awesome and location was perfect, you’re only a 10-min drive into town :)"

Stayed with a pet","Stunning views is right! You feel welcome right away, Sarah left friendly messages on dry erase boards by the front door and one near the kitchen. First of all the place was spotless inside, very orderly with plenty of room. The kitchen is finely updated and Sarah left us a welcome basket with snacks from local businesses, which we found to be really cool. We especially enjoyed the loose leaf tea. Also, thoughtfully, there were bottled waters for us which are very much needed when traveling to higher altitudes. The spacious deck off the back of the house has a neatly landscaped lighted pathway that leads to a hot tub. We soaked after dark and the star viewing was other worldly. The fire pit has an amazing back drop that made us feel we were far from any city. The king size bed in the main bedroom is extremely comfortable and the high thread count sheets were a nice touch, we slept like babies. Sarah came to say hello and was very friendly to us and our mini schnauzer."

Stayed a few nights","This was, by far, the best Airbnb experience I've ever had! My girlfriend and I decided to take a last-minute trip to Durango, and VERY fortunately stumbled upon Sarah's listing. After a long day of driving, we easily found the residence and followed really clear instructions (posted throughout the house) to get settled in. We immediately fell in love with the rustic surroundings and the spacious first floor (there were only two of us, but we want to bring kids back soon...PLENTY of room!), but the best part was upstairs.
We were greeted with a handwritten note from Sarah along with local tea, soap, beer, and chocolate, not to mention four eggs laid by the family's chickens! We loved every second of our stay, but the highlights were definitely the hot tub and the incredible firepit area where we had the unique pleasure of getting to know our hosts under a gorgeous night sky and around a warm fire. I could go on, but I'm out of space, so I'll end with this...thank you, Sarah!"

If for the road noise, I would have given the property five stars. The back deck is lovely but you should know that you share the property with the owners home. The two acre description is mainly behind the property and does not feel as private as I would have liked given the proximity to the main house. Sarah was lovely, and we enjoyed getting to know her and family and dog."

Our family had a winter wonderland adventure. The weather created some obstacles, which Sarah handled with true dedication and care for our family.
Sarah goes above and beyond with inviting treats for the young and grown. The kids sled right in the back yard off the beautiful deck. Our daughter has an incredible memory for her 13th birthday. Thank you Sarah."

Stayed a few nights","This AirBnB is fantastic! Don’t hesitate to book it or it will be taken! Sarah is a super responsive host. She even left us farm fresh eggs and a basket of local goodies for our stay. The location is close enough to town to take in all of the great restaurants and shops and a great, quiet place to relax after a full day of fun! The star gazing was amazing! We will definitely return to this beautiful place!"

The property is beautiful, quiet, and peaceful, yet minutes to downtown Durango. The hot tub was perfect to relax in and Sarah was even nice enough to provide firewood during my stay. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in the Durango area!"

The deck was relaxing, hot tub was perfect after a day of biking, and the beds were comfortable. The kitchen was a great size for us to cook and gather for girl talk and enjoyment."

We had a wonderful soak in the hot tub and had our coffee on the back patio while looking at the absolutely beautiful views, even got to hear Sarah’s chickens chatting in the background. I really do believe that Sarah’s place is definitely on my favorite list. Would LOVE to stay there again. Thanks Sarah!"

Sarah was the best host and went above and beyond to welcome her guests (beer in the fridge, local goodies, and even a personal handwritten note!) She and her husband were also gracious enough to give us hiking recommendations for the area we were going to and were super accommodating with some extra needs we had.
It's the perfect distance from town where you feel remote but are close enough to get anywhere, has designated workspace for remote workers, has a really nice open layout, and the best part - the outdoor area is incredible between the patio / hot tub / bonfire pit / views. Loved our stay here!"

We felt right home! The view was stunning and our trip was much better than we expected and Sarah played a huge role in that. She knew all the fun hotspots to go in the area and led us to some amazing places. Probably the best family vacation we’ve had and it definitely wouldn’t have been so awesome without Sarah’s help and guidance! If your planning on staying in Durango I would definitely choose this place!

She gave her guests a glimpse of what Durango had to offer while supporting local vendors at the same time. Thank you for your hospitality, Sarah. The little gestures did make us feel more at home at your place."

Stayed with kids",Perfect location and great host! Sarah is very responsive and thinks of little thoughtful gifts for the entire family to make the stay memorable. Downtown is a short drive but at this location you dont want to go into town. Home was clean and extra linens. Very thoughtful and descriptive instructions on everything to use in the home. The home is situated against beautiful red cliffs that truly make the property one of a kind. Due to the rain we were only able to use the firepit one night but so glad we got to. They definitely had a creative side in this design. The home has plenty of room for many guest or just 1 family. The first level of stairs is a bit tricky but my 3 and 1 year old managed without a hand rail just fine. The house was clean and very airy to enjoy the mountain air.

The main level is the living room, a full bathroom, laundry room, and the guest room that has the bunk beds. The upper level is the master bedroom, master bathroom, dining, kitchen, and exit to the patio where you can grill, eat, have a fire and hot tub. I totally recommend this place unless you have someone in your party that cannot do stairs. The kitchen has many utensils etc if you plan on cooking. Nice size fridge and pantry too."

Stayed a few nights","If all Airbnb’s were like Sarah’s, I would never stay at another hotel in my life. I was actually about to book something half the price as Sarah’s place, but saw her listing right before I booked and her reviews made me adjust our budget so we could experience her place. I’m so glad we did. It was sooooo worth the solitude and beauty for her location. From the hot tub, you have beautiful red rock views from one angle, and beautiful green Mountain Views from the other angle. Usually when I’m on vacation, we wake up and are immediately out the door to explore, but I found myself wanting to linger at the property, making breakfast with the farm-fresh eggs, and just relax on the porch for a bit while the kids explored on the red rocks. We ended up wishing we could add on an extra night!"

1.
And that's a wrap. Great spot. Incredible attentiveness. You can be everywhere without putting up with anything. Quick trips to traipse around town, to stumble over to Trimble, or zip up the hill for countless Coal Bank adventures. Or just hide out in the Woodshop in quiet mountain town comfort."

Kids loved the chickens that are right next door and enjoyed the outdoor games
Durango is beautiful and it’s only an hour from silverton so this is great place to stay if you are coming from low altitude so you can sleep at lower altitudes then head into the mountains"

Complimentary Fresh eggs, local goodies like tea, beer, root beer, soap and chocolate (and a scavenger hunt😊) started our trip off amazing! This property has the perfect location less than 15 min from town but with all the perks of the quite with an amazing view. This is the perfect place for a relaxing vacation. We enjoyed hiking right outside the back door, ping pong, cornhole, foosball, roasting marshmallows and of course the hot tub. You won’t be disappointed. Sarah is a wonderful host!"

After sleeping in the comfy king bed and making breakfast in the morning in the well stocked kitchen, we stepped out onto the deck to gaze at the red rock cliffs and just said, “Ahhhh…”
Although minutes from town, it has the feeling of being away from it all. The hot tub is nice and hot and we really enjoyed spending time on the deck.
Great as a couple’s getaway and great for families, you won’t be disappointed staying here! Sarah provided some lovely touches like local goodies and recommendations. If I could give 6 stars I would."

Stayed with kids","overall, this is a great place to stay at. no major complaints whatsoever. At one point, there was an item that needed immediate attention and the host was pretty responsive and took care of it right away. The house itself had everything we needed. I really liked the fact that the pantry already came with some leftover items such as ketchup, cooking spices and cooking oil, this made cooking handy (as I had forgotten to buy these). I loved the location of this place, close enough to downtown durang, like 10 or 15 min but far away to get the feeling of the countryside. I was really comfortable asking the host for recommendations or any tourist question icould think of. I would definitely stay here again. thanks for hosting us."

Our stay started off with a cute scavenger hunt for the kids and a complementary s’mores kit, tea and chocolate from local stores. Sarah’s husband personally woke up each morning and shoveled snow off the drive way and scrapped ice off our cars for us knowing that we had plans to go out on the town during our stay! BBQ propane was out when we were there but they quickly came to ensure we had what we need. We love how clean, organized, and comforting the home was. The home is certainly fully stocked with supplies and responsive communication was very much appreciated! I love how clean and organized the home was. Views from the home was impeccable and heating throughout kept the home warm for us. We definitely would return again :)."

Very close to the airport as we flew in at midnight and had no problem finding the place. Sarah your host, will have the light on and the house heated before you arrive if you ask her to. The master bed, lined in wood logs, was incredibly comfortable and located right off the kitchen and on the same level as the hot tub. Downstairs was the foosball table and Net-flicks on TV. Full kitchen so we cooked almost every night, breakfast every morning and made sandwiches each day for our trips out to adventure. We will definitely be back and will bring others with us!

The back yard is a vacation destination in itself!! The pictures do this no justice. Plenty of delicious food locally , close to everything. Mesa verde was so much more than I expected and I felt rivaled Yellowstone and RNP (I have vacationed in both). Do yourself a favor and research the native history, put some flute music on your playlist and sit in that hot tub looking at that view and any worry in life you ever had will
Melt away❤️❤️. Perfect post covid reboot !!!! Ps although we did not travel with kids this time this home would be very welcoming to a family. There is a ton of things to do close to this home if you so choose but be pre -warned :you won’t want to leave the yard !"
