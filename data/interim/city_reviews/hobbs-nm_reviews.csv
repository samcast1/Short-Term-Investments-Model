It was a great place for the entire family to stay, and being able to cook and grill meals was amazing. Kitchen has brand new pots, pans, and anything else you would need. Coffee machine with pods was amazing and was just what we needed during our stay.
Host was very responsive and made the whole stay pain free with no issues. I can't say enough how beautiful and what great shape the place was in. If we ever travel to this area again this will be the first place we look to book."

Stayed about a week","These hosts are two of the nicest I've ever had on airbnb! I rented this place for one week to scope out the area before committing to a long-term rental for my contract. I ended up booking one of the other apartments in the house, because I preferred it's particular ambience despite fewer amenities.
The Rose Room features a full kitchen, a spacious living room area, and lots of storage in the bedroom. It's very good for night-shifters because the bedroom does not have windows - close the door and it's almost black-out dark. I slept extrmely well through the hot days thanks to the dark room and the powerful a/c unit in the bedroom. There are string lights in the bedroom to give you some soft warm lighting. On my days off, I could still enjoy natural light from the vaulted window in the living room. The shared hot tub is huge!
You can text the hosts for anything you need! They brought me brand new tubberware in varying sizes within an hour of my requesting it"

Stayed one night","I had a quick overnight at Melisa’s spot. Very easy to get to and I had a chance to meet her and her husband in person. Really nice folks as we chatted for a bit.
Spot is certainly cozy and exactly what I needed to crash and get back on the road.
One thing I should note that’s not easy to tell from the listing, but there are quite a few tall ledges getting into the room and down the bathroom stairs. Not a big deal, but can definitely throw you off in the night if you’re not aware.
Would definitely stay again."

Stayed one night","Honestly, was one of the easiest places to get to. It was not to far from restaurants, or our destination for the reason of being in Hobbs. The price was not bad at all, especially for just two of us. I would most definitely be interested in staying again when I'm in that area. My recommendation is a 9 out of 10, only reason for the living room area just needs a small heater for the person sleeping on the futon."

The kitchen had only 3 coffee mugs, 6 plates, 3 wine glasses. We had to purchase mugs which were taken home by family members. Rodney kindly responded to my request for dish towels and hand towels. Compared to other Airbnb experiences this lack of some of the basics was disappointing."

Rodney and Laura were proactive with check-in details and were quick to respond to our questions. This made it a worry-free booking with my busy work schedule.

We loved having an unexpected but handy high chair! Kitchen was updated and well equipped as were bathrooms. Signs throughout were funny and amusing and helped set a tone that was a relaxing getaway from home. Only suggestions would be perhaps to provide tissues, more wastebaskets in bedrooms, more clothes hangers and maybe more washcloths. The tile floor did make my barefooted husband's feet dark, so mop more thoroughly for bare feet. You really have the place very well appointed in every way. Thank you for a fantastic stay. We would love to make this an annual destination."

Stayed with a pet","This was a beautiful and very clean home. Easy to check in. All three beds were VERY comfortable. Plenty of space for the six of us to move around. Neighborhood was quiet. It is very close to a Walmart for all those little things you may need. The hosts were very responsive, which is a huge plus.
If you want to sit outside, you will need to bring your own chairs, as there is nothing to sit on at the 3 patio spots.
Very minimal amount of supplies for our stay, but that is an easy fix, so I’m sure the hosts will have that taken care of.
It was nice to be able to park your vehicle in the garage as well as on the street in front of the place."

I walked to Starbucks every morning with my dog. If you do not have a car, everything you need (restaurants and groceries) is within walking distance. And we really enjoyed the quaint neighborhood.

Luckily we had some folding chairs in vehicle. Super quiet neighborhood. However. Joe Harvey is a main thoroughfare and there is a fire house right there. So lots of traffic and sirens. Lovington Hwy is right there too. The hospital is out that way. So lots of big trucks and siren noise. Walmart is 5 minutes away as well as numerous restaurants. Hosts very receptive. We will definitely stay again ."

Stayed with kids","I go to Hobbs to visit family a lot. I usually rent 2 hotel rooms, and even 3 one trip. I found Hector's place by chance and it was comparable to the 2 hotel rooms I was looking into. I have had a couple of bad experiences with small town airbnb's pictures not matching reality. I'm so glad I took the chance. It was me and my daughter and 6 yr old grand daughter. It was so much nicer to be in a home with amenities and the best part was the time we got to spend together in a beautiful home that is loved dearly. The kitchen was great. All you would need including spices, and various other items you don't usually see. The decor is stylish and some really thoughtful pieces. He has a patio and fire pit and grill. This home food not disappoint and the host was just as great. We will be skipping hotel separating stays, for a place together, to just spend time enjoying our getaways with each other. If you want a quiet, private and peaceful place this is it"

Stayed with kids","The house was nice and clean when we arrived. Location is great with fast food restaurants at a walking distance.Hector allowed us to check in a bit early since we overlooked the time zone difference from Dallas to Hobbs and ended up up arriving an hour early which was nice of him. The house was decorated with nice Christmas things which made the house feel homey. The two things that could make the house a better experience would be to add tvs in the rooms or at least in the master bedroom since there’s only one tv in the whole house located in the living room. We also saw quite a bit of roaches which is something I really don’t like, This should get handled before it gets worse with time. Overall the experience was good for the price"

This is the 2nd Air BnB that I have rented in Hobbs. I loved this one because it has a private back yard, and the neighbors aren’t so close. Everything you need is provided. This house is right across the street from Carters for weekend groceries. Lots of fast food restaurants around. The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. This was just an all around great experience. I’d definitely recommend."

There is also a Walgreens right across the street.

Stayed a few nights","Hector’s home is one of the best Airbnb’s I’ve ever stayed at. The place is immaculate, very modern. The master bathroom is amazing, so big. Loved the kitchen too. Can’t say enough about how amazing this place is. Hector was very responsive to any questions. If you’re in Hobbs and need to stay at a place, look no more than this beautiful Airbnb. Also, it is close to a park and the neighborhood is perfect for running!"

The location allows for easy access to anything in Hobbs, and is across the street from a small park - perfect for kids. The house is beautifully updated, and came with all necessary cooking supplies, towels, and bedding. AC worked great too, and Hector was very communicative. Thanks so much for letting us stay!"

Stayed a few nights","The house was great! The only complaint I had, is of no fault of the owners. The neighbor’s dog barked nonstop until late evening. That needs to be addressed by neighbors, I don’t see how they could listen to that day in and day out! The toilet was a little wobbly in the master bath, but not an issue. Otherwise, it was a perfect place for us to stay while in town for a few days! If we are back in Hobbs, we will definitely stay here again!"

Stayed with kids","First time staying in Hobbs, New Mexico. We got here at 3:30 in the morning and arrived at our cousin’s place. The lovely hosts let us check in 3 hours before the actual time, which was very convenient since all of were very tired from the 9 hour drive from Denver.
The house was just as described and very nice, comfortable, cozy, warm, lovely, and just right for the family. Rooms were spacious for the amount of luggage that we had. The shower was just right and super warm. The kitchen was clean and comfortable and amazing to cook in. Wow, the closets were huge and great.
The host was very friendly and welcoming. We didn’t get to meet them, but were very responsive when I had a question or comment. I would definitely recommend this lovely place. If we come next time, we’ll try to reserve this place again. 5/5
Thank you so much for your patience and understanding. And just thank you for everything.
Love from Denver, Colorado."

My friend and I stayed here for six weeks and they accommodated to our needs whether it was helping put a lightbulb, dropping off the garage remote, or lending us the mailbox key. The place was perfect for us since the kitchen and living room separated the house and made it feel like we each had our privacy yet we could still share when we wanted to. Having a washer and dryer also came in handy, they kindly left tide pods and dryer sheets. There are pots and the basic kitchen essentials as well. We needed to study during our time here and they set up a desk. It was definitely used! Thank you to the Palacios team for making us feel welcome and helping accommodate to our needs during our time here."

We spent a lot of time visiting (and napping!) on the back patio. It was perfectly shaded with comfortable seating.
Owners were receptive and friendly. We 100% recommended this property and will book again if we’re ever in the area."

There's even a fully stocked coffee station. The den was a surprise bonus room. The wifi was strong enough for both my boys to be gaming at the same time. You can light up the night with an amazing outdoor space that also has a firepit and a bit of wood to burn. The host is very responsive and left clear, simple

Stayed with a pet","The home is nice and conveniently located. All basic needs are met. Parking is easy and garage parking is available. One roll of paper towels and one roll of toilet paper for each bathroom are provided, but no backup. Kitchen is nicely furnished with small appliances, pots, pans, dishes, and cutlery. No filtered water or ice from equipped fridge. There are no night stands or bedside tables in the guest rooms, except for one on one side of the king bed in the master bedroom. The living room could use an additional sofa and it also has absolutely no side tables or coffee tables. Nor does the living room have any lamps; only very bright overhead lighting. There are also no seats on the nice outdoor porch, so no seating at all available outside. The bedroom television remote did not work. The master bedroom main light did not work. The towels were very fuzzy and had other people's hair on them. When drying off, I got covered in towel fuzz and found a stranger's hair on my leg."

These are just things that you need working for the guests. Other than that it was ok.

We had no problems with the neighborhood and felt like it was close enough to everything we needed. Not being from NM, our 2 little dogs didn't like the rock yard (it was a gamble) or the large aggressive dogs next door attacking the fence if our dogs and theirs were out at the same time. (they were otherwise quiet and never an issue unless you have a dog out at the same time)
We had a great trip and the pictures and description is accurate and worth a stay for sure."

I called to let them know and they answered immediately. Not only did he answer, but got ahold of a plumber and called me back within five minutes!! Also, the remote batteries died and they had someone drop off some more within twenty minutes!! That had never happened at other places I have stayed. Well done you two! The place was great for our family of four. Not only will we be back, but we have recommended it to others we know that travel to Hobbs. I would highly recommend staying in this beautiful house with great hosts. Until next time, thanks again!"

Group trip","This is the cleanest and most beautiful Air B&B. The area is very quiet and in a good spot to go wherever in Hobbs. This will be my family vacation spot every year. You will NOT be disappointed Rodney and Laura are nice people. I recommend this place to everyone visiting Hobbs, New Mexico, it's way better than a hotel."

Stayed with a pet",It’s a small three bedroom house that is clean and new. It’s in a central location close to Bender and Del Paso. The area was quiet. I highly recommend this house over any hotel.

Stayed with kids","Beautiful house, so bright, love the design, decor, and especially the 3 big cozy beds! The beds were amazing, and helped us get a great night sleep! The air conditioning was amazing, especially with the heat in the 100’s! Perfect distance from everything & safe new neighborhood! Door dash, and other delivery services deliver there! Definitely will book next time we’re back in Hobbs visiting family!"

Stayed a few nights",Nice place in quiet neighborhood. Plenty of room for 4 people. Beds were very comfortable but I would have liked more blankets. My bed only had a thin blanket and there weren’t any extra blankets available. I would stay here again.

Stayed a few nights","This house was plain, good for a bachelor but I was with fiance and daughter. Cold with paper thin blankets and no spares. One extra towel for 4 people. House looks like a fixer upper bought to upgrade a few things then rent out. Outside was not in good shape or clean. Inside was clean and tatseful. Beds and mattresses were not comfortable. This place wasn’t worth the upfront interrogation or high fees. Also had someone banging on a bedroom window it the middle of the night then people yelling down the street along with sirens. Will be looking for a hotel next time."
