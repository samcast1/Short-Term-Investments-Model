Stayed a few nights","Jennifer’s place hands down was amazing from 1st contact till departure. Beautiful area and home. We felt right at ease and enjoyed the space. I highly recommend staying here. Her personal touches and having anything and everything you could need was phenomenal. The honest cookies with a personal note was a huge bonus. Husband ate them all but 1 🤣 I got that one. Lol
Check in was simple. Bed was comfy. Everything was clean. Pool felt amazing. Space was perfect.
Thank you again Jennifer for an awesome few days with brand new grandson. We appreciate all your hospitality.
We will be back!!"

Stayed about a week",Jennifer and her family are great hosts hands down! They are willing to go above and beyond so that your stay in their Cozy and Safe Guest House is just like at home. Everything is exactly as described and the pool is fabulous. Heated and well maintained the swim is so relaxing. Not to mention the fully equipped kitchen and washer/dryer that makes your long term stay just like at home. Sparkling clean and fine touches this place stole my heart. Last but not least the cookies are such a nice and welcoming sweet present that gave me great vibes throughout the entire stay and I will happily come back at any given time for another round. Thanks again for the cozy stay!

Stayed a few nights","AMAZING HOME! The place was better than the photos online. Jennifer was the most above and beyond hostess we have encountered. The list of available extras and necessities was top notch! From gum, cold waters, warm cookies and a very welcoming card; to shaving cream, extra toothbrushes, antacids, and allergy medication. Just wow! We booked this home while I was in town for a wedding. Two large mirrors and especially the outdoor area by the pool (which felt great), allowed for amazing photos. Lastly, the comfort and cool temp, which could be adjusted, made for a great sleep! Outside of the home, we were close to fast food and restaurants, grocery stores, and coffee (if you wanted something other than what was already provided). Very very convenient, safe, and quiet home. We would happily recommended this home and would love to book here again!
Thank you Jennifer for the amazing space you created, the quick responses, and simply being available to us when we needed it!🫶🏽"

Stayed with kids","This place was beautiful, comfy, and in a safe neighborhood. We did have a few complaints but they are easily fixable things:
1. Some dishes were dirty or in poor condition
2. The heating was on a schedule that made it very hot at night time. (73F - 80F) We had to manually go in and delete scheduled temp settings so it would stay on our preferred setting which was within the standard temps that Trent wanted it to stay at in the binder. (68F - 73F)
3. The grill was in poor condition and not clean
Despite these complaints we overall had a pleasant experience staying here. Thanks Trent!"

The house is spotless, decorated so nicely and very cozy. The fireplace is wonderful, the neighbors are quiet, and even the back porch is welcoming. This house is one you want to come back to time and time again. The garage access is also very nice when the weather is a bit cold outside. Everything in this house is top notch, beds, linens, decor, furniture, everything! We look forward to returning soon."

Stayed a few nights","Thank you, Trent, for having provided two fantastic, destination experiences in Lubbock! I've enjoyed staying at your amazing and comfortable homes, and this particular one was exceptional. It was obvious that every interior space was carefully considered and remodeled with upscale design, lighting and function in mind. I greatly appreciated getting a wonderful night's sleep as the beds and linens were extremely comfortable. It's also rare that I've ever experienced Airbnb kitchens, dressing areas and family rooms that are so well-equipped, clean and beautifully decorated with everything needed to feel at home. Thank you also for providing the lovely, locally-made soaps and shampoos -- those additional touches truly enhanced the overall experience. I also appreciated your prompt communication and helping me to seamlessly extend my stay. I'll definitely be returning with every trip to Lubbock as well as sharing about your special properties with family members and friends!!"

Also this is the first property that I have been to that has a garage without a garage opener.
So u must let yourself out the garage and then go back in the garage to close it, then through the house to lock the door."

Stayed one night","As a Super host of 5 homes myself, I can tell you emphatically that Trent & his home are both Exceptional! His attention to detail & the extra amenities he provides make for a perfect stay. The home was fresh, trendy & had been recently remodeled. The towels, sheets & bedding & mattresses were new & the house was very tastefully decorated. I would have gladly paid 3x more than his nightly rate so this home is such a great value. All I can say is that if this spot is avail for your dates, you would be foolish to choose any other home! A+++"

Stayed a few nights","We had a great experience with this Air BnB! The home was beautiful and exactly as pictured. We loved that there was a coffee station, sample toiletries in each bathroom, a few laundry pods, and a few dish washer pods for guests to utilize. Trent was a great communicator and made it a smooth process for check in and out. We traveled into town to celebrate Christmas with our step daughter and Trent was very accommodating before our stay and told me that the Christmas tree and Christmas lights would stay up for the duration of our stay. Couches and beds were comfy with lots of extra pillows and blankets to make it a super cozy home. Kitchen had everything we needed to feed our family from home. I would definitely stay here again!"

It was spacious, comfortable, super clean. We greatly enjoyed the outside area as well—my children especially had to be pried out of the hot tub. We also used the grill.
The host was incredibly kind, friendly, and responsive. She gave us good, family-friendly recommendations. The house is close to many amenities. We had to take one of our children to urgent care and that was only a five-minute drive.
The neighborhood was safe and quiet. We greatly enjoyed our stay and would recommend that if you are traveling to Lubbock, that you book this property."

Stayed with a pet",I really enjoyed my stay at Bryce and Kyles place. I was taking a road trip to New Mexico from Houston and it was the perfect spot to rest my head for the night. It is impeccably decorated to make you feel right at home. Super clean too. My dog absolutely loved the totally fenced in yard. He’s a small dog and I usually have to worry that he will escape in small holes in fencing but that was not a problem here at all. The fencing is secure all the way around so it was easy for me to relax in the beautiful hot tub while my dog roamed around and played. The host was also super responsive I got replies to my messages in a matter of minutes. I’d highly recommend this place to anyone traveling to or through Lubbock.

However the main reason we chose this place was because it had a jacuzzi, and we really needed that to help us relax because of how over worked we’ve been. But most of the jets in the jacuzzi didn’t even work. So it was more like just a hot bath. If you’re gonna have a jacuzzi, the whole thing should work, all the jets, not just a couple, which barely did too. So a little disappointed, as that was the main feature we were excited about."

Garage is small, but we were able to squeeze in our mid-sized SUV. Some curtains are light and see-through, but rooms and bathrooms have solid blinds for privacy. Cleanliness: rooms, bathroom and living room were clean and neat. Kitchen and yard had a few issues. Host Response: We wrote them twice. First time the response was almost immediate. They gave local shop advice. 2nd time was during checkout. No response, but we were able to checkout just fine."

Big dining room table was perfect to get lots of work done. A private bath in the master bedroom was a lovely surprise! And a giant walk-in closet for longer stays! The location was perfect - UberEats deliveries within 15 minutes, Uber pick-ups within 5 minutes. Bryce and Kyle were very communicative and accomodating. If this house was near me, I would live in it!"

Group trip","As someone who has stayed in 100s of airbnbs this was by far the best stay and experience I’ve had so far. David was super friendly and reached out early to ask if there was anything we needed before our stay so he could help or accommodate it. The house was in a great spot and was beautiful. It had everything you needed. Washer, dryer, nice fridge, good AC, clean bathrooms, great living room, and to top it off an AMAZING pool. We were in the pool about 99% of the time we were at the house. It was super clean and felt amazing. The tree provided great shade and it was perfect. There wasn’t much more that David could’ve done for the house. I definitely recommend this to anyone that wants a house in a peaceful neighborhood with a pool and a great host."

House was immaculate. Interior design was very impressive. Guest sign-in book was a nice feature. They even provided snacks. Laundry was great. Fenced in yard was a great feature for my dog. This is one of those houses that makes you take out the trash and not just remove the sheets but start the load of laundry for the sheets. Still have them 5 stars because the place felt safe and was very clean"

We appreciated being able to park in the garage, especially with as cold as it was! The waters in the fridge and the snacks on the counter were a pleasant and welcome surprise and a nice, thoughtful touch to make us feel at home. Especially with two little kids. There was a high chair, crib, and pack n play for our baby, which was much appreciated as well. All in all, it was a wonderful place to stay and we plan on staying there again the next time we are through town. Thank you Barbara!"

The AC was out so she offered this location at a discounted price to help us out as we did not want to be in a house where the temperature was 85 degrees. I was a little disappointed that this home was not offered at the same price as the first booking seeing how what occurred there was out of our hands but in the end the host tried the best they could to help us in a tight spot as there were no available hotels for us to go to. Overall a good experience and I would rent from this host again when in the Lubbock area. We will be here often as our son is a TTU student.

Unfortunately, although no animals are actually allowed to find dog hair at check-in on some upholstery and cover. We also had to free the beautiful and really spacious garden from dog droppings before we could use it.
For our guests number, the equipment in the kitchen for self-catering was sometimes a bit scarce. Otherwise, the house is really super equipped.
So overall, we were happy with a few restrictions."

Stayed a few nights","The Chilton House was amazing. Based on past experience, our expectations of Airbnb in the Lubbock areawere not high at all. But Sydney has an amazing offering. Not only is the house named after a famous....ish, drink discovered in Lubbock. But Sydney was kind enough to leave the ingredients for us to make a Chilton upon our arrival. And then we gave ourselves a tour and we were very happy with the place. The beds were extremely comfortable. My wife actually joked about taking the comforter home with her. Our daughter loved the 2 other bedrooms (somehow she used them both).
We were there to visit with family, so there was no cooking. But, the kitchen was stocked with everything you need, even if you want to BBQ. Sydney even provides coffee!
All in all, this was a great place just barely outside of Lubbock, on the best side of town. Stay with full confidence that your time here will be very comfortable."

Stayed with kids",this place was one of the best we’ve ever stayed at. very clean and Zane and the co-hosts were very responsive. they even were flexible with check in and made sure we were able to get there as soon as we needed. very nice kitchen with everything you could need. the bathrooms were clean and even had extra toiletries. we didn’t get to bring our dog but the space was very dog friendly. we will definitely be staying here again when the need arises!

Stayed one night",We just needed a place to lay our heads while coming through and it was well beyond our expectations. We had a bottle of wine waiting on us and super cute origami folded towel animals. Also host was super wonderful and answered questions immediately. We had also found a kitten that we thought was a stray and host went over first thing in and found its owner. He not only loves animals but had a great home to stay at!Highly recommend for anyone!!

The fully fenced back yard was so perfect for the pups who were happy to run after a while in the car. We needed an extra hour at checkout and Zane accommodated us wonderfully without question. I highly recommend!"

Stayed with a pet","Zane was very responsive in his communication, which is always appreciated. The house itself is basic with straightforward amenities.
The two things to be aware of is the very strong smell of air freshener plug-ins and that the yard is full of foxtails. One of the reasons we booked the house was for the yard since we were with our dog. Unfortunately, both the front and & back yard was completely full of foxtails, which can be deadly for dogs, so there was no way we could let her off her leash."

Stayed one night","The house was exactly how it was presented. Easy access, instructions were clear. House was clean. There was a bottle of wine for us as a gift. We are not wine drinkers so we left it for the next guest, but it was a kind gesture. Everything worked properly, no issues.
As for Zane, he was extremely responsive via text. About 30 minutes after the 10am check out, we realized we left some of my mom’s clothes hanging in a closet. I texted him of the situation and he replied back quickly saying he would provide me with a new access code to go back inside up retrieve them. This was after we left the house at 7:45am for a doctor’s appointment. Very accommodating.
When we got back home 2.5 hours away, my mom realized she might have left her keys at the house. I texted Zane, and he jumped into action right away. He was able to find them and offered to mail them back to me free of charge. Very kind and we are extremely grateful.
Great house and even better host. A+++++

Our dogs absolutely loved the backyard, especially after such a long drive and had plenty of space to run around and play while we enjoyed the seating area. The location was great, with many places to visit and restaurants nearby. I also loved the special touches put into the place, like the Lubbock and Texas wall design which was a perfect spot for a picture. Also offering a local wine to relax with and I especially loved the “You had me at woof” sign which definitely goes with the Rest your Paws” theme.

The kitchen sparkling white and a comfy L shaped couch and apps ready to watch on the tv made a nice place to curl up for a movie. I will check to see if his place is open every time! Thank you for the extra level of comfort."

Stayed with a pet","Zane was very easy going. He was kind enough to allow us to check in early and check out late. I always appreciate an Airbnb that doesn't require a pet fee. My dogs LOVED the fenced in backyard and the two toys that were provided. They had so much fun! The living room was really comfortable. My husband enjoyed the giant island to prep dinner on. It was nice having an ensuite bathroom and a tv in the master bedroom. The house was close to Target and several restaurants. The neighborhood was quiet.
Only thing is there are a few lightbulbs that are out, the tubs were kind of dirty so I ended up cleaning them and the tv stand in the master bedroom was very dusty.
Overall we enjoyed our stay and appreciated Zane's hospitality."

We fell in love with the house immediately… it almost like being at home - very well equipped. The unique and tasteful decor was the icing on the cake.

Wife and I are fans of stained concrete floors. But it was everything. Kitchen is beautiful and house well decorated. Beds are on the firm side which I like and need for orthopedic reasons. Short version, as long as this property is available when we travel in this will be the one we always pick."

Stayed about a week","This home is just perfect in our opinion. Homey but not cluttered. Wifi is stable and enough for streaming. In a nice neighborhood. Close to everything but still super quiet at night. Lovely neighborhoods for a morning walk. Brianne is always helpful and responsive and flexible. This was our third time staying here, but not our last. We love this home, this neighborhood, and Brianne! Book it!!!"

Stayed a few nights",If I could give Bri’s place 10 stars I would. She strives for 5 stars but my visit was way above that. Let's just say they went above and beyond to provide the best service. I’m very picky about where I stay and Bri met all the standards. The place was immaculate. The AC was very cool which is a priority in this hot Texas temperatures! Checking in and checking out was a snap. There is also a garage which made unloading and loading the car easy. The neighborhood was safe and in an upscale area. I was about 2 miles from where my son lives which was great. I plan on visiting Lubbock frequently and Bri’s places will always be my first choice for my home away from home. Thanks Bri & Matt.

Other than that it was very clean and nice. They even leave out some snacks and waters in the fridge. The game room was a hit with our kids. I reccomend this place."

Group trip","This was our second time booking this house. We love it. They are great about making you feel at home, but yet they still treat you like a guest. They take care of cleanup and you're not having to run around trying to figure out where to dispose of trash when you leave. You don't have to stress about getting beds stripped when you're trying to just get on the road. It's a small thing, but, it makes a difference when traveling. They have snacks, water bottles, dinnerware, silverware, etc. They provide a laundry detergent pod and dryer sheet in case you need to wash anything. The beds & bedding are super comfy. The jet tub is AMAZING! it was great for my gf's back after a long day of working. We didn't use the arcade this time, but it is really cool. Just be mindful of the stairs as they're a little steep. Check-in was incredibly easy! The keypad is a nice feature. We'll definitely be back again."

The hosts are very thoughtful with the snacks & water they give you. It's immaculate, organized, and worth the stay. We loved checking out and how they handled cleaning the home after. Like going to a hotel and not having to strip beds etc., we don't mind doing it, but it's nice to not have to worry about it. Don't forget to go upstairs and kick back into the 80's with pac man 😊"

Stayed with kids",Great house and location. Really enjoyed the game room and being able to park in the garage. Only complaint is the use of air fresheners through out the house. We are a fragrance sensitive family and it was hard to breathe. Please consider removing all artificial fragrances or replacing with essential oils. Same with the laundry detergent and no dryer sheets.

Stayed a few nights","Oh this home... As beautiful as the pictures are, it is more amazing in person. This home was just breathtaking.
Entering the beautifully landscaped front yard, one is greeted with a safe entryway. Simple keypad access, no keys to lose, or messages to send. Open the door, you are greeted by a pleasantly clean, and very wonderfully smelling house.
The kitchen; Jevon has a coffee setup that is amazing. The sink has a filtered water dispenser. No need to be running out to buy water and Ice.
The laundry room was clean, and well organized. The washer and dryer are newer; with all the bells and whistles.
We loved the game room. it was a magnificent place; where the family enjoyed each other's company.
Cooked dinner, and ate on a clean, large, and very elegant dining room table. Cleanup was easy with a dishwasher, and provided dish soap and hand soap, and cleaning sponges. Book this place if available. You'll never want to stay anywhere else in the Hub city!"

Stayed a few nights","We went to Lubbock to watch the Jelly Roll concert and we were so happy when we arrived. This home is beautiful and clean. It smelled fresh, very private and was so comfortable. The pool was a welcome amenity, as we had had over 60 days of 100+ degree weather where we live. Jevon was super responsive every time we messaged with questions.....that was awesome. I always worry about the beds when I stay at Airbnb's so I went straight to the master bedroom to try it out and it was AMAZING. We had a blast during the evenings, playing in the game room. All in all, this home is probably one of the most comfortable, secure, safe feeling homes I have ever stayed in. We will definitely be back, should we ever need a place in Lubbock again!!!"

Stayed with kids","Nice neighborhood. Fabulous backyard with pool and fire pit. The new game room is awesome and adds 4 twin beds for additional sleeping options. The host was extremely responsive to every need. Of note, the pool area and outside patio have cameras that monitor all your activity. This is stated in the listing. Also, you will sign an additional rental agreement for this AirBnB and put up a refundable deposit (ours was $300). Once there, you will be asked to sigh a waiver regarding damage and injury while using the pool and fire pit. That was all a different experience for us since using AirBnB. Overall, a positive experience. If I listed one con it would be the need for improved kitchen supplies (which I will message the host about in detail.) Loved the home, it was beautiful. This is my best Lubbock AirBnB experience so far. Would definitely stay again."

Stayed with kids",We do Air BNB 2-3 times a year so its not super frequent. This house was one of the best places that we have ever stayed in! We took our kids to Hamilton and Dude perfect for a nice local getaway for us since we are from a nearby town. I really enjoyed the attention to deail that Jevon showed toward the coffee makers in the Kitchen. He was so thoughtful about adding most different types of coffee makers so that whatever your style is he had it covered. Outside was like a private secluded oasis. Our kids enjoted playing corn hole while we relaxed by the pool with comforable reclining furniture. The back yard had a TV and a BBQ gril both of which were immaculate and in perfect working order. All the towles and linens were included and where you would expect them to be. The garge was converted to a game room with Air hockey and foosball. Our kids absolutely loved this room with the small chairs that were on the floor for gaming and watching TV. We Will be back!! 100%

The rooms, bathrooms, living room & kitchen are just the best we’ve ever had the opportunity to stay in and enjoy from Airbnb. Definitely the Best and most well stocked kitchen along with the BEST coffee bar we could have ever asked for. The backyard was simply fabulous and beyond what we expected. Though all the photos are beautiful, the entire house is even better in person. We can’t wait to be back!"
