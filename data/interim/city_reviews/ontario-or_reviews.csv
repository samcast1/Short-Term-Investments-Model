Stayed one night","This is an absolutely beautiful Trailer/Home. I struggled w/ the key pad..but Jill was available to come guide me. Once inside it was simply amazing. The bed was heaven. One of the greatest parts of this visit was the ""detailed welcome book"" and EVERTYTHING is labeld..so you dont have to guess what each lightswitch does..or how to run the AC/heat or which remote to use.
The outdoor seating area is private, roomy and open.
This is a fantastic stay. You will not be disappointed at all.
Thank you Jill !!"

Stayed one night","Staying at Jill's place was a pleasure! We literally wanted for nothing. Directions and parking are a cinch, check-in was simple, and the RV is VERY well appointed! Everything we needed was provided, down to a fan in the bedroom. I usually travel with my own so it was a joy to see one waiting for me! Local restaurants and stores are only a couple of minutes drive away. Be aware, this neighborhood is full of life and that does bring sound. Knowing we may encounter sounds during the night/morning we opted to turn the HVAC fan to ""on"" so it ran continuously while we slept. It was the perfect white noise to block any enthusiastic kids or waking roosters. We awoke peacefully on our own terms the next morning. Jill's place was the perfect stopover point for our road trip and we hope to return. It would be a great longer-term base for exploring the area. Highly recommended!"

The farmhouse has A/C, which was a great feature during our stay - we had highs in the 80's, and the A/C kept the house comfy and cool. They were also very responsive communicators, and very patient! Their farmhouse allowed us to celebrate the vow renewal of dear friends that we haven't seen in almost a decade, and to do so in comfort. We highly recommend their farmhouse, and if we are in the Fruitland/Ontario area again, we'll definitely book with Tyson and Wende again!"

Stayed one night","this is a gem of a find in the Ontario Oregon area. few places left on this planet i feel i could leave a door unlocked and still feel safe. this house is one of them. the house itself is one of the cutest houses that i have been in, the decor was spot on, the house immaculate. the beds very comfortable. the host was very accommodating and made us feel welcome. and best coffee bar and snacks! i wish other bnb, vrbo's etc could take notes from this place. if your in this area, i can not say enough good things about it. i would definitely stay here again."

We left the airbnb to go to an event and in the end, we had all wished we would have spent our time at the house instead. It was so awesome! It was a big hit going with an airbnb vs a hotel room. What a difference! Thank you for making our night so memorable.

Stayed a few nights","the farm house is hands down number best Airbnb we ever stayed at and Tyson is so friendly and accommodating to the people who stay, wish more people were that way , the house was right out of the picture book story of how a farm house would be looking modern day way, the beds are so comfy and he mostly provides everything you might and may need on your stay. from a personal welcoming no matter what time your arriving and making sure you have everything for your stay and how to work every thing you might use during your stay, his created the perfect image of what your might picture how a farm house would look today, it's amazing. long with a beautiful setting and a cat or little dog that might come say hello to while u stay, fresh apples depending on what time u stay that you can actually pick off the tree yourself, witch is a amazing if your a city girl like me that's never actually seen them growing on trees. I would recommend to anyone who wants a safe comfortable relaxing stay while visiting fruitville to stay here, way better and much quieter and inviting than anything else offered in a 100 mile radius of this place. we diffently always try to stay here time we visit, cause it's actually with the money we been crazy not to stay here. the farm house is so warm and inviting you'll never want to leave , I know I didn't!"

Stayed one night","HEATHER AND NATHANS WERE WONDERFUL HOSTS!
This place was just right for me and my Bestie the reason for the stay, She flew in from South Carolina to visit me!
Heather and Nathan contributed to a wonderful fun comfortable night! We had a GIRLS NIGHT TO REMEMBER! Heather and Nathan made that possible! ""-)
I always like to end my reviews with the best and worst thing about my stays. So here we go. BEST: how the rooms were set up, it was open and for us gave a feeling of being away at camp. WORST: Would have liked a lamp or light I could have on in that would be a dimmer bulb where the personal business area is. The track lightings too bright, because of how the beds are set up puts to much light out. If one person is trying to sleep and the other is still up in the business area doing some work.
So if that is the worst thing I can say don't ya think you are pretty much guaranteed a good stay? If not then your just too PICKY!"

When we needed something a little more unusual for the kitchen they did their best to supply it very quickly. We found the beds supportive and everything in good working order. The space is very spacious and thoughtfully designed for a simple layout. The neighborhood is on the north end of town and not especially walkable, but that is the nature of most of this rurally located small-medium sized city. I would not hesitate to recommend their loft to others."

Everything listed in the description was there. We were even pleasently surprised by the extra touches that Traci provides, ie iphone chargers, paper towels, coffee pods, laundry soap and a basket of welcome snacks. She goes above and beyond to make you feel at home. It was nice to park in the garage to load and unload. I would definitley book with Traci again."

Stayed with kids","Was a beautiful home and place to stay for a relaxing get away to visit family in the area. Very comfortable furnishings and a great place to just hang out. We brought a few board games and enjoyed the extra large table for playing and dining. Also has a nice TV in the family room for movie nights. Great kitchen, loved the extra storage that the walk-in pantry provided. Also was very convenient to be able to park in the garage. We're so glad we decided to go with an AirBNB instead of a hotel, and are very happy we came across Traci's beautiful home. Traci was a great host and took care of anything that came up during our visit. Highly recommend this rental and would stay here again if ever in the area."

Bathroom very nice and modern. Dog park righ across the street. Was a GREAT place to stay while I had a 2 week trial- the kitchen made a fantastic “war room” where we could huddle up every day after court and strategize for the following day- the glass cabinet was the perfect area for putting up dozens of big post-its for various trial ideas. Lightning fast wifi. Absolutely PERFECT for working. HIGHLY recommend. Oh- and checkout? No cleaning required! Just wash your dishes and lock the door. Unbelievable! Usually the downside of an Air bnb is all the chores- so hard to do in the morning when you’re trying to get to work after!!

Stayed one night","Love this spot ! A nice little get away from my regular routine ! This location is in great distance from the freeway and plenty of food and shopping near by , the fence gives a nice sense of privacy! Jill is very friendly and helped with a minor outlet issue I had upon arrival! She was there with in minutes and helped sort out the problem! I would definitely recommend this place for you and I’ll be booking again in the future!"

This unit was very close to the college campus within a neighborhood of similar size houses and apartment complexes next to a great park. No grass in the front yard but well done hard-scape that creates lots of parking and a couple outdoor seating areas that were nice and shady in the evening hours. Jill has thought of everything as far as I can tell! The kitchen was superbly stocked, linens were plentiful, house was clean and nicely decorated. We only stayed one night but we had everything we needed and we did enjoy the local recommendations and the guest book. Would definitely stay again!"

Jill was an awesome host; beautifully redone and curated home and clearly dedicated to her host role. I didn’t realize when I looked at the listing that it was a split house with another Airbnb spot which was totally fine, I just felt bad that we had a crying baby but we couldn’t hear anything from the other side so maybe they didn’t notice!! It had its own door and parking and we didn’t run into each other. Loved the very thoughtful touches like coffee/creamer/sugar. Very comfortable (probably new) mattresses. Loved that!!"

The kitchen and home are well appointed and were entirely clean. The beds were comfortable. Jill went above and beyond by contacting us about something we had left behind after our stay and we were able to get it before we left the area. The communication and instructions leave you without any questions about what to expect before, during and after your stay. Her kindness is an additional example of what makes her a super host."

Stayed one night","I often wonder if people who give places like this these glowing reviews actually spend more than 5 minutes there. I spent $170 for one night here. Based on the fact that I had one of the worst night’s sleep ever, that’s about $70 more than it should have been. I’ll start with the positives. It’s clean and nice looking. The free bottles of water and snacks were a nice touch. The Wifi worked well; my laptop tested at about 40MB download speed. Now, for the not so positives.
I’ll start with the biggest problem, since the entire point of staying at a place is to have somewhere to sleep at night. The bedrooms were hot and stuffy, which made sleeping almost impossible…unless you like sleeping in 80 degree rooms. There are two small window air conditioner units, one in the living room, and one in the kitchen. Guess what rooms don’t have A/C? Both the bedrooms. So the back of the house is a totally different (and much warmer) temperature than the front of the house. Based on their size, and the fact that half the house was too warm, the A/C units don’t appear to be adequate to cool a 4 room house. This could easily be solved by having two stand-alone fans (one for each bedroom) for guests to use to cool down the bedrooms. It was in the mid 90s the day I checked in, and the bedrooms remained warm the entire time. There are ceiling fans in the bedrooms, but I had them on for several hours before I went to bed, and they did little to cool the bedrooms down. Additionally, as someone with sinus issues, having ceiling fans 5 feet above the bed blowing lukewarm air on me all night wasn’t an option. Oh, and if you’re looking for outside air to perhaps cool down the bedrooms at night, good luck with that. Neither of the bedroom windows open (and the other 2 windows have the AC units in them). So the house is hermetically sealed up like an office building.
Just when I thought the sleeping situation couldn’t get any worse, once I got into bed I realized it was equipped with a hard-as-a-rock memory foam mattress AND pillows. Good grief. If you know anything about memory foam, besides being rock hard, it also absorbs body heat…and, as I mentioned, I was already hot enough being in a hot bedroom. Out of frustration I was trying to beat the pillows throughout the night when I couldn’t sleep, in a futile attempt to soften them up. It didn’t work. So I spent the first 2-3 hours of my night trying to get to sleep and being half-awake most of the time. Finally around 4 AM I passed out, because at that point I was too exhausted even with the hot room and hard bedding.
Other “features” of the place: Upon entering the house, I was greeted with the smell of a potpourri explosion. I’m guessing that because the owner allows people to smoke pot in here, she needs to then mask the scent with some awful spray. Um, how about not allowing smoking instead?
The lighting in the bathroom is atrocious. Unlike every other bathroom on the planet, there are no lights above the bathroom mirror. Instead, the bathroom lighting is in the center of the bathroom. What does this mean? It means that while the shower is lit up decently from the lights, you get to see yourself in the dark in front of the mirror. The left side of your face will be partially lit, while the right side will be in the dark. So if you always wanted to look like the Batman villain “Two Face”, have I got the bathroom for you. Don’t try to shave your face in front of that mirror unless you’re feeling brave.
Last but not least, there is no way to adjust the volume on the TVs. They are Roku TVs, which theoretically should come with remotes with a volume button on them. Instead, the only remotes provided are the same ones you get when you buy a Roku box. With the AC blasting in the living room, it’s often hard to hear the TV. I searched through every menu option on the TV I could find, including Googling it to see if there was a trick, and nothing allowed me to adjust the TV volume. Because a lack of light is a theme in this house (the bathroom wasn’t the only room that was unnecessarily dark --- the kitchen was the only well lit room), I couldn’t see what may be on the side of the TV itself, so I even used the flashlight on my phone to search for a volume button on the TV, but couldn’t find any.
$170 for all this fun? I think not. Ironically, the Wifi name in this house is “Giggles”. I guess that could be one reaction to this place….maybe after some of the green stuff."

It’s just on the edge of Ontario, yet town is just a few minutes away. The upstairs sitting porch was one of the many small surprises, which included very workable kitchen, roomy cozy bathroom, and separate sleeping quarters upstairs that gave a compartmental and private feel that I did not expect. Parking was easy. The room was so quiet, I could have slept forever! I highly recommend this AirBnB in Ontario, Washington - I am super impressed by this town and this place to stay. Thank you so much!"

Group trip","The home was big and accommodated our group of 7. The low ceilings in the bottom floor were a little inconvenient for our taller family members. The ceilings on the main floor were tall, which made the rooms feel bigger. All beds only had a fitted sheet, folded blanket and pillow. 1 of the rooms had a top sheet, which we used to make the bed. Three of the fitted sheets on the beds had oil stains on them. When we reached out for top sheets and clean fitted sheets, the hosts promptly provided what we requested. The bathmat in the upstairs bathroom was dirty and had some hair on it from previous guests. Overall, our stay was ok. Despite these inconveniences, the home was conveniently located and the hosts were very communicative, kind and helpful."

Stayed with kids","We were so grateful that Heather and Nathan's ""Little Big House"" available when our children and grandchildren announced they could join us for Christmas near there. They were kind enough to allow an extension of our rental when one family surprised us by arriving a day early. They noticed that snow was predicted the next day and went over to put deicer on the driveway before that early check-in. We can highly recommend this home for families with several children who want to be together in a homey atmosphere rather than split up in multiple motel rooms. It was in a convenient location for us to get to nearby winter activities such as Caldwell's Winter Wonderland light display and Boise's World Center for Birds of Prey. Thank you, Heather and Nathan!"

Inside the Friday I found an old pizza box’s and beer andThe dishes were dirty. The back yard was being renovated which warranted a ton of cause tape areas. Saturday night we come back and the bbq is at the other units patio. Unaware this was a shared bbq. But the worst part was the sliding back door was off its hinges. Like someone had tried to or did open it. All our items were accounted for aside for a vape pen. I would not stay again.

Bed in small bedroom had a broken frame hidden so I stubbed my toe. Kitchen was ok but the counter top was coffee stained and the dishwasher was still full. My biggest complaint is the liv room furniture, old and not comfortable. This seems to be common among airbnbs that I have used. I will say that the shower is awesome! Best I’ve had in some time. Overall it was ok, and priced fairly, just that a little more attention would really help and make for a more enjoyable stay."

Stayed with kids","The experience left much to be desired. From the moment we arrived, it was clear that the cleanliness of the place was severely lacking. The state of the accommodations was simply gross.
There was an overall lack of cleanliness. The floors were dirty and sticky, beds were slept in, trash inside was built up and dog food every where. It seemed like the property had not been properly cleaned in a long time. There was a a green trash bin overflowing in the front and reeked, making us feel uncomfortable from the start. Plus a room inside was locked which made us feel very vulnerable.
Adding to our disappointment was the host's complete lack of communication. Despite sending several messages and inquiries, we received no response from them throughout our stay. It's essential for a host to be reachable and responsive, and their negligence in this aspect only added to our frustration. We ultimately decided to leave after 2 hours of nothing from her and decided to go to a hotel instead."

Stayed one night","We stayed here July 8 and again Sept 1. While this unit is inexpensive, other rentals are nicer and a better value so we won't stay here again. A few insights:
(a) The lack of privacy is unsettling. The back of the unit faces the parking lot for Malheur County Fairgrounds. The window blinds are broken for the sliding glass door in the back allowing anyone in the parking lot to see inside the unit.
(b) We notified Jocelyn the window blinds were broken July 8. We expected they would be fixed for our 2nd stay but they are still broken as of Sept 1.
(c) Online instructions need to be updated; examples include: The door lock has been replaced so the online instructions for entry are obsolete. Both interior and exterior pictures are outdated.
On the plus side: While yard weeds desperately need to be cut, the unit was exceptionally clean on the inside both visits. The water filter on the kitchen sink is a nice touch. The bed is very comfortable."

Stayed one night","This rental was very clean -- we'd say it was spotless! Lots of nice touches: my wife recently had back surgery and said the bed was perfect, the bedroom had black-out shades, the kitchen faucet had filtered water, the TV offered a wide variety of platforms (Youtube, Netflix, etc.). The property has zero 'curb appeal' but the interior was nice and incredibly clean. The pictures posted online need to be updated to more accurately reflect the property and furnishings. The property backs up to the Desert Sage Event Center. There was a large event the night we stayed but the noise was muted and not intrusive - we slept soundly without any problem. The only concern we had was that the broken blinds for the back door provided no privacy, allowing those using the Event Center parking lot to easily see into the unit. The neighborhood looks a little rough but the neighbors we met were friendly and welcoming. Finally, Jocelyn was a great host! Overall, we had a 4.9-star experience!"

First and foremost, the house was spotlessly clean and well-maintained. Jocelyn takes pride in providing a comfortable and welcoming environment for guests. The rooms were spacious, beautifully decorated, and equipped with all the essentials one might need during their stay. The beds were incredibly comfortable, ensuring a restful night's sleep.
The kitchen was fully stocked with high-quality appliances and utensils, making it a joy to cook and prepare meals. The living area was cozy and inviting. Moreover, the complimentary Wi-Fi worked flawlessly throughout my stay. The location of the house was also fantastic.
Lastly, I must commend Jocelyn for her outstanding hospitality.
In conclusion, my stay at this Airbnb house was nothing short of exceptional."

The home is a hodgepodge of decorations and furnishings, far from “ and oasis “ as described. Clearly needed some maintenance and extra cleaning. The patio shades were missing half of its slats, and some wall art missing with the hangers still on the wall. There was a couple lightbulbs missing. When I contacted her, she quickly responded that she would send housekeeping over if needed. Much appreciated her quick response."

Stayed with a pet","Our visit had a rough start but Jocelyn responded quickly when I messaged her about problems (for example, the cleaner hadn't run the dishwasher so there was no clean silverware and the microwave was dirty). Jocelyn got the cleaner back and sent supplies we needed , and when we got home she followed through on her offer of a discount for the inconveniences during our 5-night stay. We travel with our cat and appreciate that her ""pet-friendly"" policy includes more than just dogs!
Jocelyn's place is comfortable and in a quiet neighborhood. The duplex is in a great location for walking to the 4 Rivers Cultural Center and its Japanese Garden, to old downtown, to shops and coffee, and for groceries. Close to the fairgrounds if you're coming to an event there."

The lock on the door gave me some difficulty once, but perhaps that was user error. The internet was a bit on the slow side, but hey it is good to practice patience and get away from a screen sometimes. The TV did have several options for watching television, and I enjoyed watching grey's anatomy while lounging on the furniture. Between some episodes I enjoyed the large bath tub, and then was off to bed in a cozy king size bed. Would recommend to anyone needing a place to spend the night in the area!"

Stayed with a pet","Perfectly suited to our needs. We are relocating from the PNW to Arizona, and this was a great first stop since we weren't able to leave Seattle until about noon. Easy to find, clear directions, easy access, very clean, and very quiet.
Others have commented that the location wasn't the best but we didn't have any issue. We weren't asking for much though, since it was just spend the night and head out in the morning. Easy freeway access which was nice too. I'd recommend.
One thing to note, since we are travelling with dogs: it does have a fenced yard but it's open at the front end of the house (yard goes along one side of the house but the fence doesn't close it off at that end. It wasn't a problem for us since our dogs don't run off, but just something for other dog owners to keep in mind."

Stayed a few nights","We stayed here while meeting a future puppy that was nearby in Idaho, so although it was a nice neighborhood we didn't really spend any time locally and just jumped on the freeway to Idaho (it is conveniently about 3 minutes to the freeway). The place was clean and the photos were accurate. We did have an issue with the entry (the lock was broken). Luckily, we were able to get in. Jocelyn, the Host, did respond a bit later (she was traveling and had some wi-fi access issues on her end). We explained to situation and ended up sending over a handyman the next day, as we were afraid we would be locked out. He was nice and in fact, acknowledged it was broken and removed that part of the lock (the door was still secured). Overall, the space was clean, spacious and accommodating and we would likely stay there again, if in the area."

Stayed with kids","We needed a place to stay for the night on a long road trip & at first this place seemed to meet all the criteria—it was clean, the beds were comfortable, and it had everything we needed. As we were going to bed, we noticed that the walls between the duplex units were very thin—we could hear the neighbor’s TV through the wall & could hear them coughing in the bathroom. But it didn’t seem like a big deal until shortly after midnight, when the neighbor started playing music so loudly we could recognize the songs and song lyrics through the wall. It was so loud it was impossible to sleep even with earplugs & a pillow over my head, and the music didn’t stop until 4:45am. We were then able to sleep for a couple hours before we had to get up & get on the road. It’s obviously not the host’s fault that the guest/tenant on the other side played the music so loudly, but I left feeling like I needed to warn any light sleepers (or anyone who enjoys sleeping between midnight and 5am) that this might not be the place for you."

Would not stay again because of the location, but the Airbnb itself was nice. No communication from the host, but none was really needed. The smartlock was a little hard to read in the dark but carefully reading the hosts instructions helped me figure it out."

There is a trend with airbnb hosts where they are becoming host-centric and not customer-centric. Not so with Jocelyn! Not at all! The overarching theme of her house rules are about your comfort and enjoyment while you are hosted by her. Thanks for a great stay, Jocelyn!"

Stayed one night","This was a very nice alternative to a hotel/motel. It was roomy enough for moving around and the two chairs and couch were comfy. Though we barely watched TV, it was nice to know that Netflix was available on the Roku. The flies were bad and more came in when a door was opened to the outside. It also smelled like dog, but we were forewarned that it was a pet-friendly place. It was clean; it had less kitchen supplies than we expected, but it worked for the food we prepared. I would chose it again over a hotel."

Stayed with kids","Great place to stay on yhe way from here to there. Jocelyn left the a/c running for us so when we arrived on a very hot day we were greeting with cool welcoming air - an excellent start!
We were five people so the place was a bit small but it searved its purpose with great value for money.
The beds were very comfortable, the sofa was okay, I wouldn't suggest relying on the single fold out couch (very thin mattress with bumpy springs) so if you have extra people then the extra queen matress is probably a better choice.
The hot water wasn't enough for five showers but we didn’t have to wait too long before the water was hot again, so all in all pretty good (and very good if you're only about 3-4 people)"
