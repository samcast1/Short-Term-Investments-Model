Stayed a few nights","Perfect for me. I do business on the East side of Austin, so not having to drive to downtown is ideal. The location couldn't be more perfect. A very ""Austin"" place to stay. Will certainly return."

Stayed one night","Second time staying at this place and like the first time was extremely content.
IF SPOT IS AVAILABLE do yourself a favor and book it!
Maybe next time I'll get to do the sauna and cold plunge, but for now great stay.
If you uber to anywhere downtown or in south congress its at $6 - $10 total.
Only about 5/7 min max
a lot of privacy and room!"

Even with the shared yard everything felt very private and the cold plunge and sauna was a fun addition to a cozy getaway. Only thing unexpected was the TV was downstairs with the couch instead of upstairs in the loft space. Would absolutely stay again!"

It is a beautiful home, and all details seem carefully considered, from the artful and comfortable decor, to the many relaxing spaces (sauna, cold plunge, front porch swing, covered porch). It’s a little oasis. We particularly loved the art work of Deep Eddy and paintings by Ever that were present throughout the space, as well as our daily visits with Whiskey the garden cat.
Very thankful for our time in this space. :-)"

Stayed a few nights","My stay at Julie's Airbnb was nothing short of exceptional! From the moment I arrived, the host made me feel completely at home with their warm welcome and attention to detail. The space itself is beautifully decorated, offering a perfect blend of comfort and style.
What truly set this experience apart for me were the incredible amenities. As someone interested in health, I was very excited to use the sauna and take a cold plunge for the first time. It was a great way to start the day! These features added a level of luxury and wellness to my stay that was truly special.
The location of this Airbnb is also fantastic. While we opted for an Uber, the place is only a 20-minute walk from the downtown area which is really favorable for anyone who wants to avoid the stress of parking.
I can't recommend this Airbnb and its host enough. If you're looking for a memorable stay in Austin that combines comfort, luxury, and convenience, look no further. I can't wait to return. Thank Julie!!"

We enjoyed every minute of our time here and would urge others to book this place! Also, Whiskey the cat was the best bonus!!"

Stayed a few nights",This was by far the funnest airbnb I have stayed at. I clean them for a living and this was squeaky for authentic. Perfect art. Architecture and fun! Had everything we dreamed. Fun shower. Great tub. Sauna and cold plunge. Made me feel alive again. Not 1 but 2 guitars to write songs with. Body mirror to find the right outfits. The neighborhood was the most quiet. We were able to walk in the middle of the street without a person in sight and enjoy the fun houses and history. Never felt unsafe once. Walkable local entertainment and grocery. Quick scoot or Lyft to the city parts. We actually enjoyed this neighborhood more than the city. If we ever make it to Austin again we will for sure be staying here! Thank you to the beautiful friendly hosts and neighborhood feline whiskey to make us feel so welcome!

It felt a little older than I anticipated, but the listing is clear that this is a funky older home that has been restored— and they did a great job restoring it! Just had a slightly more shiny image in my mind from the photos— but I loved and really grew into the real-life charm. And the heated toilet seat, great heaters, and sauna all kept me cozy through this stormy first week of 2024. Comfy bed, nice coffee. I would absolutely stay again!! Thanks y’all! 💚"

Stayed a few nights","Julie's place was in a great location for exploring Austin without a car. I could walk to the bus stop, a bike share rack, a coffee shop, and many good restaurants. Some highlights of the home: a toilet with a warm seat and a bidet with warm water, 2 acoustic guitars, sauna, and screened patio. The only minor drawback was that the 2nd bed was up high and a little scary as there were no guard rails. Also the ladder, when drawn down, blocks the entrance to the hallway leading to the
bathroom and main bedroom."

The mix of ambient and natural lighting truly made the place feel cozy. I tried to spend as much time in the cute outdoor patio and porch. The gorgeous garden and greenery almost makes you forget you’re in the city. Despite its central location, quiet hours were respected. Whiskey the friendly cat was another highlight of my stay. Although I came on a work trip, Julie’s place offered so much to help me unwind at the end of the day. I truly hope I get another chance to stay here!"

It was easy to find, a breeze to get a rideshare, and we were even able to walk back from our final destination of the evening. We all agreed that the outdoor space and plants were very calming and peaceful. I was the only one who used the sauna (the cold plunge was way too daunting!), and it was easy to use and adjust. The beds were all comfortable and clean, as were the towels we used. Julie and her gang were also able to coordinate an early check-in, since we were already in town, which was awesome! Definitely worth the stay!"

Overall, I would stay here again, it was close to everything, easy to get to, private, and perfect for our little family. Thank you!"

It was a perfect retreat....plus at 107 degrees for several days at a clip, the cold dunk was perfect...sauna wasnt needed as if you are outside for 30 min in any part of Austin, you get your sauna.
Thanks so much for having us!!!"

Stayed a few nights","We loved our stay here! Would happily book again. The inside is peaceful and artfully outfitted and there was ample outdoor space (though we came during quite a hot time so didn’t take full advantage). Great for a romantic getaway! The AC worked perfectly, which was important during Texas summer. We didn’t spend much time at home, so the location was absolutely perfect – everything we wanted to do was often as close as 2 mins and sometimes at longest 15 mins by car. It seemed like it could be walkable, though it was too hot to take advantage of this. The area was generally quiet and it feels very tucked away behind it’s own gate and gardens. There is a lot of character in this property as well! It was clearly designed by someone who loved the space very much. It did feel clean, though just to note there are some vintage looking pieces (like tub, kitchen sink) that while certainly clean, don’t have a spotless appearance due to their age if that makes you squeamish."

I think that everything is perfectly clean it's just something that can be gross if you pay attention. Visit was great and Julie was responsive. I wouldn't skip just due to the shower since this is a common problem, I just want people to be aware."

The sauna and cold plunge were fun amenities!"

Honestly the best bnb space I’ve ever stayed in. Entertainment was within walking distance. The space was as advertised. Every amenity worked properly.

Stayed a few nights","This location was a total Austin-vibe gem. Very artsy and unique, cool loft with pull down stairs, all amenities you could possible need. The highlight was the bathroom - full shower, separate sit down tube (throw back vibe), bidet, toilet seat warmer. Everything was super clean and cozy. VERY close to downtown and many activities - easy to drive or Uber. Our group had an awesome time!
The only possible negative was no heads up on booking page or prior to arrival that there is a gentleman that lives in the back in a separate building. We arrived late (930 PM) and it was dark and we were greeted by a man (Kenny) that honestly scared the crap out of us (in a funny way). He was very polite and helped us get settled in and we didn’t hear or see him the entire rest of the weekend. However, a significant heads up would’ve been appreciated! I went back to look through booking page and messages and the only thing I could find that mentioned him was a message on the evening of our check in."

The sound of the wind chimes outside the bedroom window and the way the afternoon sun seeped through the curtains made it extremely difficult to get out of bed. I miraculously got out of bed at some point and walked to the nearby coffee shop which was a delight! Everything about this place is amazing! The tub, rain shower, location, screened in patio, radio which I kept on the classical station- truly a relaxation paradise!"

Stayed a few nights","We loved staying in your rental. It is so and full of fun surprises. We loved the binder you provided, we took it with us everyday and followed a lot of your recommendations.
This home was fun and laid out in such a fun and thoughtful way. The cantilevered stairs. The porch swings. The sun room. The cathedral ceiling. The open air shower. The bidet (I’m now a convert 😂).
We enjoyed everything about your home.
Thanks you for your kind hospitality."

Stayed a few nights","I have nothing but great things to say about this beautiful home. I've stayed at a lot of Airbnb's in Austin over the years and this has, by far, been the best Airbnb experience I've had. The house itself is gorgeous and feels like home. There are so many little artistic touches all around the property that we loved. We frequently talked about how we would love to live there! The location was also perfect! We love east Austin and rarely want to stay anywhere else. We very much enjoyed the cold plunge, as it was really hot in Austin. We also adored the sweet cat on the property that showed us nothing but love and made it easier for us to be away from our own kitties. The onsite caretaker, Kenny, was very helpful, attentive, and all around a very cool guy. We will definitely be renting this beautiful property again next time we are in Austin. Thank you so much for this awesome stay!"

Stayed one night","This place, this place!!! It has something for everybody. If you want a great location to go a short distance to party you have that! You want to enjoy just some time and reflect, this place provides that too. If you want to check out great breakfast tacos and coffee the next morning. There is that as well!! Judging by what I’m writing you can tell I did all three!! The infrared sauna and cold plunge was amazing addition. They thought of everything at this property down to the shot glasses!! Thank y’all so much, would love to come back if you will have us. :)"

Stayed a few nights","We couldn't have asked for a better stay than at The Carriage House. We felt at home in such a peaceful, beautiful corner of Austin. We had no problems at all, the house had everything we needed and was extremely convenient. Within walking distance there was a Target, Monkies thrift store, and Goodall's restaurant at Hotel Ella for a great brunch. The State Capital was easy to access by walking, as was downtown. We opted to Uber to South Congress when we spent the day in that area. It was a pleasure to come home to The Carriage House after a long day exploring the city. We would love to stay again."

Our hosts were very accommodating and responsive. The check-in was easy and there were detailed instructions once we arrived. In fact we arrived quite late at night but this was not a problem.
The kitchen was also very useful and had all the necessary appliances and cooking basics (including cooking oils, herbs, and coffee/tea). If we had any problems or questions, Cindy and Stephen were very quick to help.

It's perfectly located to walk into Downtown Austin and has all the amenities you could possibly need. The fact that it's also in a very peaceful part of town is the icing on the cake. For a single traveller like myself, it was cavernous. Certainly compared to the places I tend to stay in Europe. And it would be absolutely perfect for 2+ people. I highly recommend a stay here!"

Stayed a few nights","If you are in town visiting Austin, this is a perfect location! The Brady Carriage House is set on Judge’s Hill. It is conveniently located close to all the sites, yet off the beaten path allowing for a cozy and quiet evening!!! I was a bit nervous renting close to downtown, but when I read the reviews I took a chance! Wow, it sure was worth it!!! This house is located in a very affluent area and there is no reason to be concerned!!! I was also pleasantly surprised how close the location was to bike sharing. My husband and I rented bikes for 2 days and went everywhere! Another perk is the free parking pass that allowed for easy parking on the street in front of the house for the entire stay!!! Thank you so much Cindy for the great communication, recommendations and for sharing your home with us!!!! I was also a pleasure meeting Ella, the Lab!!! 🤗 🐶"

I asked the owner if guests could use the gas fireplace. Cindy came over that evening to show me how to use it! Definitely made my stay that much better. No complaints here!

Super comfy bed. Very peaceful and quiet neighborhood. Cons: the natural light is great but no curtains on the frosted windows in the bedroom is hard in the morning. Bring your eye mask! Basic necessities in the kitchen and bath (although it was nice to have filtered water pitcher), needs a little extras in the bedroom like a dresser, sturdy nightstand, and a full length mirror. Cable was pretty slow, but who comes to Austin to watch TV? 😊 all in all a good place to stay. And they were very patient when we left with the parking pass. Really nice people."

But, if you don't mind that AND if you want a clean, peaceful oasis to return to once the crazy is over, then definitely highly recommend."

Stayed a few nights","Quite simply, the carriage house is a gem! It's in a beautiful residential neighborhood that is quiet, yet walkable to many locations around town. It's perfect for a couple's get-away--charming and spacious. The bathroom is large with lots of space for toiletries. The main room has a nice dining table and comfy couch. The bedroom closet is huge, with room to hang up your clothes if you'd like. There is even a nice little porch where you can enjoy morning coffee or an evening glass of wine.
Cindy was super responsive, both before we arrived and while we were there.
We had an amazing stay and would definitely stay there again!"

Various dining options nearby (walkable), and the neighborhood itself was very charming. The unit itself was spacious, super clean, well stocked with everything that was needed, and came with free and easy parking - a great value all around! Cindy was an attentive host, and was very responsive to any questions along the way. My younger son also loved playing in the yard with her black lab Ella! We would definitely stay there again!"

When I had a question about Austin before our arrival, I appreciated Cindy's prompt and very helpful response. We would love to return to the Brady Carriage House!
I especially appreciate how understanding Cindy was when we mistakenly took the parking pass with us. Even though we immediately put it in the mail back to her, it was most likely an inconvenience for her. However she showed no sign of that to us. We appreciate how very gracious she was about our mistake. We highly recommend the Brady Carriage House and its kind host!"

The shower was really awesome! I never heard from the owner which I’m used to but that didn’t really bother me. A couple of small things… there was only one coffee filter even though we were there for 3 days. They do not provide any cream for your coffee and no snacks like most other Airbnb so if you like your coffee light like me, make sure you bring your own creamer. The water here tasted particularly awful, maybe the worst tap water I’ve ever tasted. They provide a Brita water filter but it does not help with the bad water taste much. Highly recommend bringing your own bottled water, I had lots of water elsewhere in Austin and it wasn’t an issue. The Roku tv was not working when we arrived even though Wi-Fi signal was strong, after a night of just streaming on our iPad we did a reset of the network through the tv and that fixed the problem."

Stayed a few nights","The Brady Carriage House is on a lovely street in a very quiet neighborhood. It is an easy walk to many things, including the famous Ellsworth Kelly Chapel at the Blanton Museum of Art. It's a quick drive for world class ribs or to go out for music. We were so happy to find the place was pristine, the bed super comfortable and the bath large. We really appreciated having a washer and dryer, too. Plenty of room, views out into the canopy of surrounding trees and a sweet full kitchen. Cindy and Stephen were the best hosts, very responsive and friendly. We will definitely plan on staying at The Brady Carriage House the next time we're in Austin!!"

Cindy allowed me to drop my bags off before check in which saved me because I was traveling alone and would have been stuck waiting somewhere with all my luggage. Her communication is spot on and she’s got everything very clearly presented for a smooth stay from beginning to end. I would definitely stay here again!

The location was fantastic. there are so many beautiful houses around I felt totally safe walking around the neighborhood with my 12months old baby.

Stayed over a week","Spacious one bedroom apartment with plenty of room to spread out. The location was just outside of the central downtown core so do expect a 15-20 minute walk to most of the activity and dining options in downtown. There are some closer if you go towards Lamar. The area was quiet and easy to access via Uber or receive a food delivery. Everything was clean and the host left some nice extras for our arrival which we appreciated. A couple of notes we did find it more challenging to work from the apartment. Internet was great. However the table wobbled so was not possible to have two people working there. The counter height option in the kitchen was a bit uncomfortable. Repairing that table would solve it and maybe some better chairs. If you don't work remotely like us than you wouldn't care. Also the bed we found to be very soft compared to virtually all our stays in other places. Again, personal preference just be aware it is a very soft mattress."

I enjoyed the modern features of the apartment and it was very cozy. The apartment was exactly like what is shown in the pictures. This was a solo trip and I felt extremely safe traveling about late at night. What impressed me the most though is this: The day before I was scheduled to arrive Britta reached out to provide some additional information and to ask when I would arrive. I let her know that I was arriving in the morning and planned to do some exploring until check in time. She reached back out to me to let me know that the apartment would be ready for me when I arrived in Austin! I truly appreciated her thoughtfulness and willingness to accommodate my schedule at the last minute. The next time I'm in Austin, this will be where I stay. Thank you Britta!"

Started the trip rough with another AirBnB & last minute booked with Britta, which I should have booked with in the first place. Not only was she very flexible & accommodating to us but the place was incredibly beautiful, organized & warming. The location was in a very nice, safe & quiet area. AirBnB was a walking distance from several areas but most importantly she does offer bikes if chosen to get around. Has great parking space, many recommendations & many amenities that you could possible use. She not only let us arrive within a couple hours of booking & but she also let us arrive early. This is definitely home away from home, DONT HESITATE & BOOK. Worth every penny."

It's a very clean and cozy apartment with everything you need and very close to downtown - only minutes away with Uber or Lyft if you don't have a car. Britta is an excellent host, extremely responsive, provided very detailed instructions to get in and out as well as left a binder full of recommendations of things to do in Austin which was a great touch. The area itself is pretty quiet so if that's what you're looking for away from the downtown action then you'll enjoy staying here. The only thing to note is that the apartment is on the second floor and there is no elevator, although I had a heavy and large suitcase and was able to get it up and down the stairs without a problem by myself. Overall, a great experience and I would stay here again:)"

It was a beautiful condo with everything we needed to feel at home in Austin for our 5 night stay. She even had umbrellas at the front door which were 100% necessary as we walked to and from the festival every day and it rained nearly every day.

Stayed a few nights","The condo was perfect for our needs. We had 4 guests, which was tight for the space but entirely doable. The layout of the bathroom really helped with that, because the potty area was a bit closed off from the sink area making it more possible to share the space comfortably. Having the bikes was great and made many wonderful things in Austin way more accessible. Plus the space was far quieter than I expected. I had fully expected to hear other building tenants at least a little, as you do in condos. In fact, it was entirely quiet.
The only thing to be aware of is that you need to go up a double flight of stairs (and bring the bikes up and down them) to access the condo. I am sure that is in her listing, but I didn't really absorb the information. It was no issue for us, but it might be if you have issues with stairs. The stairs are wide, comfortable, and very safe, with handrails and plenty of room to move luggage/bikes/ etc."

Stayed a few nights","Britta’s condo was beautiful and modern. We liked that the location was far enough away from the hustle and bustle, but was still just a short drive away from all the things we wanted to see/do on our trip. Britta was a wonderful host, and even communicated prior to check in when HOA work would be happening at the condo so we could plan our day accordingly. Very clean, and SUPER comfortable bed! Thank you Britta for sharing your home with us!"

I was traveling to SXSW for work and was so grateful to have a home base that was clean, beautiful, safe, and easily walkable. It truly felt like a home away from home and made our experience so special! Britta is an incredible host and was amazing at relaying all the details before check in and was very accommodating. She was super responsive and so helpful, (as this was my first time visiting Austin) and had a manual of things to do while staying there- including providing bikes, rafts, towels for all the adventures. Everything was stunning and so well thought out. I loved having our private balcony and also enjoyed the shared balcony. I truly can’t wait to come back and stay at this beautiful home when I come back to visit!! Thank you for everything Britta!!"

The space is super clean and modern with everything we could have wanted. We didn’t have a car but would totally have felt comfortable with the parking if we did. Britta offered us a ton of recommendations for things to do, both in her house binder AND in advance so we could plan ahead! She was super responsive and proactively communicated with us.

There are bikes available, which is great, but we didn’t end up using them. We mostly used a rental car, so it was wonderful to have a parking garage to use instead of having to leave the car directly in the 100+ degree weather. The bed and pillows were very comfortable for sleeping (and I’m a bit picky when it comes to pillows). The couch was comfortable for lounging (we did not use the sleeper part during our stay). The bathroom and laundry room were well stocked with essentials. Everything was clean and well organized. Check in and check out was a breeze. We would stay here again!"

The AC works great and is quiet. No road noise during the night. We didn't cook but it looked like the kitchen was fully stocked with things like flour, olive oil, tin foil, pot and pans, etc...

Stayed a few nights","Me and my boyfriend chose Britta’s place for our anniversary and absolutely loved it! The location was perfect, just minutes from all of the main downtown areas and a really lovely walk when the weather is nice! It was a bit cold most of the time we were there but ubers are super cheap and ranged from $6-$8 dollars local. Our further trips were only about $20. The place itself was perfect. Very clean, easy to access, in a nice neighborhood, and full of thoughtful details for anything you might plan to do that day. Britta provided bikes for outdoor exploring, beach towels, and a very thorough list of things to do in Austin. The decor is well designed and makes the condo feel cozy—a home away from home. Overall we had access to everything we needed and Britta was extremely responsive when I reached out to communicate! I would definitely stay here again if I find myself visiting Austin in the future :)"

Everything was incredibly clean and the beds were super comfortable. The apartment has everything you need and is thoughtfully arranged. We didn’t need to get in touch with Britta but I felt as if I could easily reach her if I needed anything. Her welcome binder was so helpful in guiding us during our stay.

We stayed for a week and Britta's extra touches - local beer and water in the fridge, a personalized welcome note, and numerous amenities - really made us feel at home. The balcony provided a comfy space for coffee in the morning and wine in the evening, and the bed was like sleeping on a cloud. We've traveled all over the world, and Britta's condo is by far one of the best we've ever stayed in within this price range. If we ever make our way back to Austin, we wouldn't stay anywhere else."

Britta made check-in and check-out painless, and was flexible and responsive at every turn.

A common area with very comfy couches and a golden view is a huge plus. Kitchen has everything you might need! Parking is great and extremely convenient! The place looks brand new!

Stayed about a week","We have stayed in quite a few places over the years and our apartment was as close to being home as we have ever experienced.
From the decor to the comfort of the bedding. The personal touches were really nice and well appreciated such as a personal note to us upon arrival, a well stocked pantry with essentials and beverages in the fridge. Since this was our first time in Austin, the notebook was very informative and helpful to reference throughout our stay. As an added bonus, we had access to bikes which really allowed us to experience Austin like a local. The place was in a very good area but it was nice to park in a secured parking garage that was conveniently located a few steps away from our front door.
We have absolutely nothing to complain about after staying for a little over a week and would absolutely stay here again when we are back in Austin."

The space was clean, was within convenient range of the concert venue we were visiting, and was super quiet despite being only a block or two from an arterial road. My only minor note is for taller guests - the shower head was high enough for me as a 6' person, but the bed was too short, so my feet were hanging off the end unless I curled up. Otherwise, cozy little spot to stay, and the air conditioning was a lifesaver!"

The kitchen area is fully equipped as described in the listing. Everything looks like it is practically brand new. The bed is comfortable. There is a luggage rack in the closet. The laundry room is in the garage below, and is easily accessible. Mark and his wife live in the adjoining house, which is located in a quiet, residential neighborhood. We spoke with Mark on the day we arrived. He was very personable and eager to please. Manor Road is just a couple of blocks away, where you will find some very good restaurants, and a couple of food trucks. I could hear noise from the highway. But it didn't bother my wife at all. She liked the place so much that she said she wouldn't mind living there."

During my stay I felt a little under the weather for no more than a couple of days. I let the host know I would be staying at home to recover and I was invited to collect some hot soup from the food truck, ""Thai Thani"", which they also manage. The soup was amazing and the food in general from the truck itself is incredibly tasty! I would recommend trying the yellow curry, it was such an authentic dish and was excellently cooked.
They were in communication with me the whole time and ensured my comfortability and convenience was tended to.
I cannot thank these lovely people enough for giving me such a positive experience as a lonesome traveller.
I will certainly be back and cannot recommend staying here enough!"

The location is great! only a few minutes away from the Moody Center. Seeing neighbors walking their dogs and jogging made the area feel safe. The room was clean and cozy.Mark left complimentary drinks which was a life saver for us as we were so thirsty when we got back from the concert. Laundry use is available but we didn't use. The king bed was comfy. Although, our only small complaint was that when we got back and finally ready for bed, we noticed that the bed is only laid out with a sheet and a quilt for covers. We preferred a comforter blanket as the quilt wasn't the greatest to use at night to sleep with. We checked in the closet hoping one was in there but there were only towels. we didn't want to bother at 2am so we made due. Overall, we
would definitely stay again!"

It took us everywhere we wanted to go to see and hear all the Austin sights and sounds. Bus line 20 even goes straight to/from the airport with no transfers. So convenient. And the Salty Sow near the Airbnb! We went there twice because it was so good. Highly recommend this Airbnb and the bus and the Salty Sow.

The location was perfect, so easy to walk to a yummy coffee shop and wait till my check in, I was able to leave my bags in a secure spot. Mark was very communicative and helpful, and so nice. The house was clean and so precious. Every detail was looked at and made comfortable. If you are thinking about either staying at a hotel or an Airbnb, I highly recommend this place. You get a little kitchen with a refrigerator and an icemaker, and there’s even coffee that you can make in the morning and some snacks if you like. The bathrooms even had little soaps and shampoos if you need it…they even had poo-pourri, so that was 5 stars right there!
The bed was super comfortable, and the pillows made me sleep like a baby…which is rare for me. The neighborhood felt safe and I was able to take a little walk and enjoy all the Halloween decorations that were going up. Really a cute area. I have nothing bad to say about this place, I really hope to get the chance to stay there again one day, and explore Austin even more. Thank you for such a great stay, and making me feel comfortable and at home."

I think I walked to three different restaunts, two bars and didn't even come close to hitting everything in the area. I also used one of the bikes to meet some friends at a BBQ spot just over a mile away. Great little perk. It was easy to walk to/from the UT football game I was in town for. Inside the place was super clean. In the bathroom were a handful of helpful extra items (I definintely took advantage of the sunscreen). Plenty of towels too. The wifi was super fast and never had any issues so working from there was easy. The bed and pillows were comfortable. The A/C easily made it comfortable despite the triple digits outside. And Cristiano was maybe the best host I've had from a communication standpoint from start to finish. Seriously great place."

One thing I didn’t expect was that the water pressure of the unit is low, but this part seems to be out of the control of Cristiano. And if there’s a double lock inside the door, that will be a plus. Overall, I had great living experience and will recommend the place to other travelers."

The deck and outdoor space was lovely, perfect for sunny days. And above all, Cristiano was an awesome host! He checked in with us after the first day and then we got to meet him a few days later, where he had great recommendations of what to check out in the area. We had a great trip and a great stay!"

The only area of improvement I can think of is to have blinds or curtains on the smaller windows. They let in a lot of light at night and made it somewhat difficult to sleep without a sleep mask.
Overall, I recommend and would stay again."

Stayed a few nights","This is our third stay at Cristiano's place and has come to feel like our ""Austin home."" Cristiano is always available and responsive to any needs we've, though the unit is so well equipped, there is little left to want. It is located behind Crisitiano's family home in one of the coziest neighborhoods in Austin. Close to UT, to restaurants, and to I-35 (but not so close as to be noisy). It is light and spacious with a lovely deck.
I've had to adjust our reservations a couple of times, and Cristiano has been prompt and gracious about making the changes. He has gone beyond the call of duty for a host.
I highly recommend this place!"

The deck was fantastic and even though the Austin weather didn’t cooperate, we enjoyed some time relaxing there. The hanging chair is fantastic. Cristiano’s hospitality was top notch and he made us feel welcome and right at home. We look forward to a return visit. Bottom line, don’t look any further and book this place.

Stayed a few nights","This is probably the best AirBnB I've stayed at- it made you feel at home immediately. The space was decorated beautifully; the pictures are beautiful but do not do the place justice. The hosts were so sweet and friendly, and very responsive and easy to communicate with. The check in and check out was convenient and easy. No matter what time of day, street parking was easy, plentiful, and felt very safe. The furniture was so comfortable- highlights included the cosy bed and the patio swing chair, and the adjustable TV to watch shows from the couch or the bed.
It really felt like they put in a lot of thought into stocking the place with every amenity you could need, like a iron, hairdryer, and multiple options for toiletries. I appreciated the little details like the ring light mirror to put on makeup with, and the wireless charger on the bedside table. The kitchen is so well stocked and easy to cook in. The fridge has filtered water and some basic pantry items to supplement our recipes. I did not use it but there were also scooters and bikes for use as well as a washer and dryer on site. The location was great- there were lovely places such as the Salty Cow for food and Techo for their agave flights within walking distance.
If I had to nitpick for some cons- some of the smaller windows do not have blinds so if you are a late riser, the sunlight may bother you.
Overall, I would highly recommend this place to anybody considering a stay in Austin and would definitely rebook it if I'm ever in the area again."

The photos are great, but the real experience far exceeded my expectations. The space is impeccable, spotlessly clean, relaxing, and inviting. Everything you could possibly need and more has been appointed. Cristiano goes above and beyond. He responds quickly and does whatever he can to make the entire experience seamless. I was moving my daughter into her first year at UT. Cristiano truly made us feel welcome and helped our process run smoothly. n The treehouse is magical The beautiful private porch is among a grandeur of massive trees. I sat in the swing every night gazing at the moon. It was tranquil and glorious Every detail is obviously well thought out, including the best coffee in the world.... Nespresso expresso, in every flavor!!!! The Austin Treehouse is my go-to now, This ARBNB is top-notch in every way, Great location, an Amazing host, and Gorgeous space!!!"

This place is amazing and in such a cute neighborhood. We walked to eat several times during our stay. I accidentally booked our stay one day too long and Cristino was quick to get that taken care of. Thank you so much for a wonderful stay. We loved having use of the SUPs and bikes! We will be back.

I did morning yoga on the tree house deck followed by a nice espresso and a chat with the cute kitty who wanders about. I also enjoyed the shower and laundry after hot days outside.

Stayed over a week","Extended Vacation!! I was here for 14 days and loved every minute! One person 2wks = excellent. 2 people 2wks = very good! This place had all the amenities I needed to actually live. Things like a kitchen (with all the utensils to cook) , comfortable bed, dining area, comfy couch, washer & dryer (below in the garage available to use), outside deck area. Close by to everything!! Coffee shops, bars & restaurants, supermarkets, close by to UT campus.
Cristiano has an electric scooter and bikes available to use. I used the eletric scooter basically to go everywhere! The city is so scooter friendly. I was able to take it into every place I visit. There are paddle boards available to use with a close by (maybe 2mi away) dock you could visit for paddle boarding along the river.
Cristiano and Christine (his Wife) were both so accomodating! I was provided a laptop to use because I mentioned I wanted to search jobs and homes in the area. I didn't bring mine with. Christine even provided a ride to the supermarket because I had planned to grocery shop while I was there for such a longer period of time!

Stayed about a week","Cristiano's place is in a quiet neighborhood, close to UT, LBJ Library, restaurants, bars and cafes, and near enough to I-35 but without the noise. The space is perfect for 1 or 2 people, clean and well equipped. The hosts are delightful people who make you feel like you are their personal guests. This is our second stay at Cristiano's place and will be my accommodation of choice for future trips to Austin. Highly recommended."

Stayed a few nights","This is such a fantastic AirBnb! Extremely clean, just as stunning as in the photos, a safe walk away from the downtown area - if I could permanently move in, I would!
On top of that Cristiano and his wife are the most friendly, welcoming and helpful hosts! And the AirBnb has anything you could possibly need - a Nespresso, filtered water, pots, pans, toaster, plenty of towels and bathroom essentials, bikes (!) - the list goes on! You can definitely tell it was put together with love and attention for detail. Unfortunately we didn't have time to take full advantage of the place as we were too busy having fun out and about in Austin, but I'd love to come back and stay longer!
Thank you again for having us!"

This location is super easy to Uber to anywhere downtown and just under 10 minutes. Also a very quick ride to the airport. The loft is super clean and updated. It has a great shower and the air conditioning is super cold, which is nice for those 95° Austin days. I would definitely recommend this place. five stars."

Cristiano was going to adjust my rate for leaving early. I didn't feel he should miss out on funds for my misfortune. He gave me an alternative of giving me a discount for my next visit which I will totally stay there again. This place was so very comfortable. I look forward to staying there again when visiting Austin.

I stayed four nights while working at UT Austin. This is definitely the perfect place to stay if you have business at the university. Each day I rode the provided bikes the short five minutes to campus. It was so convenient. Cristiano is a gem of a person and really looks out for his guests, accommodating my early arrival schedule and giving me great tips about the area. One of my favorite Airbnb experiences. I would book again in a heartbeat."

Easy communication. Very clean space. The bathroom was fully stocked with toiletries , like a hotel and the room temperature was perfect due to their HVAC unit was in great working condition , STAYING IN MID JULY in TEXAS (That's worth a mention!) This space was soooo close to everything, we were able to use their really cool ORO bikes to bike around a really cool city! I definitely recommend their place. They are friendly, accepting, and just a really cool team. The space is private in proximity to residence. We enjoyed our stay and I hope for an opportunity to stay again with them in the future."

While I couldn't take advantage of the lovely deck (because I just happened to be visiting in the midst of the worst winter storm Texas has ever seen), I can only imagine lovely afternoons spent in the sunshine out there. Also, Cristiano and his wife, Christine, went above and beyond to help me make it through the week. When everything shut down due to the storm, Cristiano and Christine made sure I was warm, and fed - going so far as to bring me food because the shops were all closed. Couldn't have asked for better hosts. All around just amazing people!"

They gave us so many great tips about Austin which made our trip more meaningful and efficient. :-) We have a 4 year and he, himself enjoyed the stay thinking he gets to sleep in a “tree house” and also, he got to play with some toys belonging to the owners’ 7 year old son left outside. He had a blast to say the least. Overall, we had a pleasant stay and honestly, the Nespresso machine for our morning cappuccino ritual and all the little details in the cute studio brought so much value to our stay. Thank you Cristiano and Christine for being such wonderful hosts.

Stayed a few nights","When you arrive, the accomodation just looks like any standard ‘garage with a loft’ in a backyard converted into living space. However, opening the front door is a revelation. The property is spacious, light and airy, has a bright colour scheme with an ‘up-to-date’ paint job. The appliances, bathroom etc are all fairly modern and the host has added some nice touches such as a good quality bath soap, some toiletries and even extra soft toilet paper. It’s only a hop, skip and a jump from all the action in downtown Austin, so what’s not to like!!! It’s one of the best Air B&B properties we have stayed in during our long trip around the Deep South👍👍👍"

Stayed a few nights","Excellent apartment in a great location. Only 10 min away from the Austin International Airport. Uber/Lyfts are abundant and extremely affordable. Lots of coffee shops and eateries nearby (try the ""Sour Duck"" that's within walking distance... ""Take Care Coffee"" serves wonderful cappuccinos!).
Christopher is a very responsive host. The space was exactly as advertised. There's coffee + tea, some condiments available. Washer comes with Tide Pods. Everything is well-stocked. The place is private though all windows do overlook the nearby houses, so if you like your shades wide-open, it might be a bit weird.
Water pressure in the shower was a tad weak but the water temp was perfect. There's an AC in the unit with the cooling/heating feature.
Fair warning if you're traveling with heavy luggage or just lost of bags - there second floor is accessible by stairs only. Also, the bathroom is on the 2nd floor, so be ready for some light cardio! :)
Overall a delightful stay, highly recommend!"

Deceptively quiet location, for all the convenience and close to the freeway, UT, &c. Fast WiFi, too."

The space was comfortable, roomy. I stayed during the summer solstice and the outdoor temperatures were hitting three digits, but the indoor temperature was cool and comfortable. The furnishings were nice, and it was a bonus to have a washer and dryer in the space as well. The shower had hot water right away, the towels were nice and thick. All the comforts of home provided. If you need to be close to the University of Texas at Austin campus for whatever reason: business, social or going to a sport events, please consider this place."

Stayed a few nights","This Airbnb was nice and clean. The bed was comfortable. It was close to restaurants and UT. Communication with Christopher was good. He even allowed me to have something from Amazon mailed there as I knew I couldn’t get it at home before we left. There were plenty of towels and pillows, but no paper towels even though there was a paper towel holder. Was probably just an oversight. The only drawbacks were that the listing says the driveway was ours. There was a car already in the driveway so we parked in the street when we got there. Then when we came back after dinner, there were two cars in the driveway so we had to park on the street which made me nervous. I’ve been towed in Austin before. Also, the listing says there is a coffee maker. There was a French press which we didn’t know how to use. We ended up buying a small Mr. Coffee at H‑E‑B."

First of all, Christopher was very easy to work with: accommodating, communicative, and kind.
The place, itself, is amazing.
I especially loved all the natural light upstairs.
The decor was simple and soothing.
The kitchen was stocked with basics, and fun to cook in.
Additionally, the whole place was super-clean.
And if that's not enough, the location is really convenient to walking to lots of great eateries, as well as UT campus and downtown.
I highly recommend this cute little house, and plan to return, myself!"

Stayed a few nights","This home was a great value for a small apartment stay in Austin. The bed was comfy and the place was clean and simple and had everything we needed to relax and use as a home base for exploring the city.
Unfortunately, the apartment smelled terrible of cigarettes (apparently the past guests were smoking in there). That was really tough for me, as I am sensitive to it. Also, the wifi did not work for the majority of the time we were there which was difficult as I had hoped to do some work there and the one time we hoped to relax and watch a show on the tv, we were not able to do so.
All in all, the stay was good and the host was really kind and helpful and tried to resolve the situations but was unable to do much. The house needs time to air out and the wifi needs to be addressed.
All that said, the bed was comfy, the place was clean and the host was nice :)"

The king size bed was super comfy, water pressure in the shower was good, and the bath towels were very soft and fluffy. The guidebook and rule book were easily accessible and easy to interpret and follow. Christopher was very responsive, as was his cute pupper, Genevieve, who we had the opportunity to meet!

Stayed one night","This was a quick getaway for my husband and me as we had a wonderful spa day planned the following day and wanted to stay close. The house is the lower level of their residence and although it was a bit awkward meeting the owner to go over house rules, it is completely separate from the rest of the house. While we did not feel it was as private and comfortable as it would have been if they also did not live there, we never saw them and our privacy was respected. It is a short walk across the street and down a rocky path to the lake and we found some really great flat rocks to sit on and just watch the boaters (and a few interesting things from Hippie Hollow). The house is very well appointed and decorated in an industrial chic theme which I adore. We would definitely stay there again if we were in the need of staying in the area."

Stayed one night","I was doing a boy's trip with my 14 yr old son. Our favorite feature: The shaded pool was cool and refreshing in the hot, hot evening. The space is very well appointed, beds comfortable and everything is spotless.
We were close enough to The Oasis to be able to pop up and enjoy a beautiful sunset from the patio. Quiet little neighborhood to enjoy some downtime.
There's access to the lake, but it wasn't quite what we expected: across the street, down a hill, and the shore was rocky and not very scenic. Fine for walking along, but too hot in August to jump in.
Host was very available, friendly, but not obtrusive. We enjoyed it!"

Stayed one night","Perfect getaway spot. Was not familiar with Lake Travis but this place was amazing. By the lake down a private road, far enough off the street to not be bothered by the very few cars that drive by. Erik greeted me at the agreed-upon time and showed me around, even gave me a few recommendations about where to eat and places to go. They have a binder with information available as well... The private pool is worth the price itself. I almost didn't go to dinner because I was relaxing in the pool. The place is the lower level of their house and there are neighbors, but the way it's set up you feel like you're secluded... The space itself is extremely nice. Two bedrooms with nice sized beds. I didn't use any of the TVs or kitchen area. Shower was nice with plenty of soap, shampoo, wash clothes and towels... They had a couple of kayaks available to use, but I decided to sleep in the next day and didn't get the chance... It's the perfect place to relax in a beautiful part of Austin."

Stayed a few nights","We loved every minute at Kimberly and Erik's place. It is absolutely gorgeous with an impeccable sense of design and an unparalleled pool-side living situation. The kitchen is well-supplied, the linens well-stocked, and the design inside very stylish. The propinquity to the lake was an absolute treat. Such a wonderful place to get away for a few days...and only wish it were longer."

This house is a work of art and the hosts and interesting, friendly and accommodating. Don't miss out on that pool! It's a dream!"

Windy point park was also about 2-3 mins away and had a huge staircase that reaches into the lake. The space was central to everything but still secluded from the road and other houses. Everything was amazing inside and out."

It's only a short drive downtown, and perfect communication throughout the stay about check in and check out. Hope to stay again very soon!!! xx"

Stayed a few nights",We had a great stay at Eric and Kimberly’s beautiful lake house. It is well anointed with a clean industrial design that was very cool with all of the decor. Very convenient to the Oasis and our boat rental which made for a very enjoyable stay. We love the private pool/patio as well. Check in was easy and Eric was on the spot to help us with anything we needed. It made for a great trip to the lake.

Good parking and the private pool is a real nice feature. It's out at Lake Travis, which is beautiful and picturesque, but 30-60 mins out of downtown depending on traffic. I would highly recommend this property."

Stayed a few nights","Fantastic place high in the hills! Loved everything about it, clean and spacious, industrial decor which was way cool, loved having coffee out on the deck listening to the water feature in the private pool! The best part for me was the kayaks that were there for our use, watching the sun set over Lake Travis down at the water. For my husband, the best part was the fact that we were only about 15 minutes from downtown, but felt like we were out in the quiet country, no city noise. Amazing place, Eric was a terrific host and we would definitely stay again! :)"

Austin became my new favorite destination as I got engaged during our visit. :)
Side note... I would not eat at the Oasis but it was definitely worth going for the view."

You are near a couple public access beaches and one beach that you can access walking across the street from the house. The beaches are a bit rocky so we just sat and enjoyed the views. Sunsets are great too! Place was very comfortable and the pool is nice on a hot day. Check in/out were easy!

We will definitely stay again!"
