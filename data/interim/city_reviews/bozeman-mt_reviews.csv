The location is very nice; it's quite close to downtown, nice and quiet, but you can still easily hop on a main road to go anywhere you need. The studio is very spacious with lots of natural light. The setup is also perfect if you're looking for a cozy evening inside, watching a show.
The owners were quick with responses and super helpful. We had no issues finding the entrance, thanks to their directions, and check-out was very easy."

Stayed one night","We came into town for a concert at the Elm. This location was absolutely perfect for that. The walk was less than two blocks from the venue!
It was a little difficult to get to if only because its down an alley of an alley... But Katie sent some detailed instructions on how to get there.
The actual space was -incredibly- clean. Like even the baseboards were spotless. The space feels very open and comfortable. The guest book was quite entertaining to look at and sign.
My only issue was that the air conditioner popped out of the window and was a little difficult to get back in.
Otherwise it was an absolutely wonderful space for a single night stay."

Stayed one night","Close enough to walk to downtown! No complaints about the place but we did pay $20 for a late checkout, thought it would go to 12 but only got an extra hour, was told we had to pay that money for them rescheduling the cleaning lady but she entered at 10 anyway! Also there was a dirty glass on the bedside table when I arrived but then I had to clean and put away the dishes before I left so would have liked that for me as well. For the price I paid plus the extra fee, it was just mildly annoying."

There isn’t AC so we slept with the windows open to try and cool it off. Would have been fine but the neighbors seem to hangout on their roof and we woke up to them eye level with us in the bed. That was an awkward surprise lol.

The host's attention to detail was evident throughout, from the comfortable bed to the well-equipped kitchenette. The location was within walking distance of downtown and MSU, where I was headed on this trip for Bozeman High School's graduation. Katie was both welcoming and accommodating, making me feel right at home. I highly recommend this studio and will plan to stay there on my next trip to Bozeman."

I would highly suggest to stay here. The morning sun pops over those mountains and it gives you a nice wake up call if you have the blinds open."

Stayed a few nights","This place had the comfiest bed of all during our visit to the area. The modern and clean suite was very relaxing with an open layout, aside from the entrance and bathroom. There were plenty of windows if you want to let in light or a breeze, plus there’s a ceiling fan to circulate air. The kitchen was super - we loved the popcorn maker for a quick snack. The bathroom overall was spacious, clean, and has a big mirror. The suite felt private from the rest of the house and was easy to find and get into. The host was responsive with directions and info on checkout. There are plenty of places within walking distance or a short drive, including the Fork & Spoon community restaurant which is a couple blocks away. I would definitely like to stay here again when I’m in the area."

Stayed a few nights","Of all the 2-person airbnb's in Bozeman, we chose the best one! Once we climbed the stairs up to the studio and put our luggage down, we stopped to gaze at the magnificent views. There are 8 or 9 large windows on three of the four walls that show off the incredible mountains. The studio is modern and super clean, with a really comfortable king-sized bed. The big-screen tv can easily be moved to be viewed from anywhere in the studio. We really enjoyed meeting the host, Katie who is knowledgeable about Bozeman, skiing, and the airbnb business in general. We plan to stay at this studio on future trips to Bozeman to visit our son."

NKatie is one of the best hosts we have ever met on Airbnb. She was super nice, responsive and helped us with any problems we had. The wifi internet was not super fast at first because the room is located a little too far from the router, Katie was super responsive at 9pm and helped to get us an extender.
Overall a wonderful experience for us, highly recommend!"

The kitchenette was quite functional, lacking only an oven (had a nice cooktop, microwave, and refrigerator). The parking was close and private, and accessible from an alley. Location is convenient to downtown, and could be walked/biked, especially in the summer. Katie makes check in and out simple and easy. We would highly recommend staying here if you are coming to Bozeman for any reason."

Stayed a few nights","We loved this little cottage so much! I came with my three teenagers to introduce them to MSU. Wendy and Mike were so welcoming, and the house and surroundings were perfect. We loved the neighborhood, and while the downtown area was walkable, we chose to take the 6 minute drive. The pillows and beds were so comfy and clean, and one night we stayed in and watched Netflix. It felt like home and we are so grateful to know of this sweet little spot. Thank you!!!"

She offers responsive communication and local recommendations - the hot springs were a highlight of our trip. Totally worth it."

Stayed about a week","Wendy was very responsive and helpful. My husband is a c4-C5 quad and I had questions about accessibility. Wendy was responsive with questions and had a ramp we could use. The house was very manageable with a wheelchair and the master bedroom had a lot of space to get everyone settled.
The two other bedrooms had higher beds which our 3 girls enjoyed. The high beds made great private spaces for the kids. They would be more difficult for any adults. The amenities in the house were great. It was a good place to stay for a trip to Montana to visit relatives.
I would recommend this place to anyone."

Not only was the place beautiful and tidy, they went above and beyond with making sure that we're well taken care of. They had little signs in the studio with things like recommendations for places to eat near the area, etc. They had Roku with guest mode so you don't have to worry about forgetting to sign out of your streaking accounts when you check out. They also provided snacks and drinks, which is not something I normally see provided in other Airbnbs. They just made things really convenient for us so we can maximize our enjoyment of the vacation.
Another plus here is that they didn't have so many check-out instructions like other Airbnbs do. I've stayed at other places where they had specific instructions on removing the sheets and towels and putting them in one place, etc. I was pleasantly surprised that they made both check-in and check-out really seamless for this place.
If we're ever back in Bozeman, I will definitely choose to stay here again!"

You will have a beautiful, cozy, and private home all to yourself in a quiet neighborhood of Bozeman. Have a fantastic sleep and then wake up and make some tea while snuggled up on the couch with a blanket. You will be beyond refreshed!"

Jeni and Ross were more than generous, accomadating , and so so kind.
They were right on the app for any questions and all check in info needed. I would give them 10 stars. I felt like family to them in tge way they really cared about our stay.
Hands down a must stay in Bozeman. I’m definitely staying again as I’m there once a month from now on.

Despite us not even asking for an early check-in, Andy had the place ready for us well before we were originally scheduled to check-in & let us know we were welcomed to come at any time. The place was nice, private, cozy, and less than a 10 minute drive to Main St. Very nice coffee offerings & bathroom toiletries made available to you. If we were ever in the area again, we wouldn't hesitate to book a second time."

Was confused when I arrived because it's described as a cottage on Air BnB but it actually seems to be a converted garage. A really nice young man helped us out. Once inside, we completely forgot what the exterior looks like! Really cute. Had everything we needed."

The cottage was clean, private, well equipped and extremely comfortable. It felt just like home. While it is only a 5 minute drive from downtown, the gorgeous Mountain View’s made it seem like it was much more secluded. We enjoyed our evening walks in the neighborhood! For hikers like us- it’s also a great central location for most hikes in the area!
Honorable mention for the sweet little black cat in the neighborhood that would often greet us once we arrived back from our daily activities! We got a kick out of it!
We will definitely be looking for openings at Andy’s cottage during our next trip to Bozeman!"

Everything was well stocked and even though there is no kitchenette area there were plenty of plates and bowls, both disposable and plastic as well as plastice silverware which came in handy when I had forgotten I needed any of those things for dinner. The location was just what I needed: peaceful neighborhood, just enough on the edge of town to feel peaceful and quiet yet not far from everything in Bozeman.

Their place was an ideal stay coming up from Yellowstone with the washer/dryer and space to repack for our flights. Wish we would have had more time to take advantage of such a great kitchen! One of the best we've had for an airbnb. There are a good deal of steps from the parking spot to the apartment, so just something to be aware of if stairs are an issue or you have a lot of luggage. But beautiful views of the mountains from the living area!"

Loved the big open windows with views out into the mountains. There was a dedicated table for working, but could also work at the kitchen counter or the couch. Internet was fast and reliable for conference calls. The space was sparkling clean. Looked brand new and like no one had ever stayed in it before. All of the furniture and bed were comfortable, easy climate control, and full kitchen, equipped with everything you need for a short or extended stay. Even have Greenpan non-stick ceramic pans which are the best. Easy parking with your own spot and keyless entry. The unit is above the garage and separate from the main house, so it's very quiet. The neighborhood itself is also very quiet, safe, and serene. Great place to walk your dog, yourself, and even a couple little trails nearby. Bozeman downtown about 10 mins, and about 30mins to some great hiking."

Stayed one night","We cannot rate Rebeccah’s home high enough! My husband and I had our United Airlines flight canceled and were stranded at the airport.. so we decided to get a place to stay for the night, and found this wonderful home.
It was the perfect location, with the most relaxing surroundings and home finishes. Everything was incredibly confortable and ultra cozy. We immediately felt rejuvenated from having been stuck at the airport all day.
The home was well equipped with everything we needed for toiletries (sans a toothbrush/toothpaste), and the ability to wash clothes - which was a life saver for us!
Wonderful coffee and tea also!
Rebeccah was super helpful, and accommodating for all our needs.
We look forward to coming back as soon as possible and staying longer!
Thanks, Rebeccah!"

Her beautiful cabin was waiting for us just as she stated. She has the cutest powder room with an outdoor claw foot tub 🛀. I will have to come back to take advantage of that 😁.
Since we arrived at night we couldn’t wait to see the area in the morning. What a breath of fresh air when we woke up to such a pretty place with great views. All her animals were very friendly bc too. Loved the horses, ponies, hens and Icelandic goats. We felt right at home. Our only regret is that we couldn’t stay longer and had to continue with our itinerary. We can’t wait to come back.
If you ever stop in Bozeman, don’t hesitate to stay in this beautiful cabin. Katy is an awesome host and very responsive. Thank you so much Katy for sharing your cabin with us."

And Bozeman is a also very beautiful place.
We are so sad that we only stayed there for one night… We would come back any time. :)))"

I was concerned about its close location to the interstate, but I honestly wasn't bothered by it at all and I'm a light sleeper and we slept with all the windows open. The farm is surrounded by trees and green; it felt very rural yet the room is decorated very cute. Loads of windows let in ample light and fresh air (there is also an A/C unit), and shades on all the windows provide shade and privacy. Would definitely stay again! p.s. shut your poop flapper!

Just a quick (5 min.) drive from town.

I was able to get some dinner to go at a nice restaurant downtown and just chill for the evening and next morning surrounded by green and countryside instead of concrete and florescent lights.

Tim and Katy’s cozy cabin was like something out of a fairytale.

A dozen or so calm and friendly animals welcomed our presence but the funny part is that they all seemed to respect the quietness.

Stayed one night",Katy’s Ranger Cabin is the definition of aesthetic! Seriously adorable decor and gorgeous views of the mountains. Cute chickens roamed the area and they have have some beautiful horses. The Powder Room was well kept. My boyfriend and I loved our 1 night stay. We also used Katy’s recs in the host guide and enjoyed a delicious dinner at Montana Ale Works followed by a soak at the Bozeman Hot Springs which made for the perfect end to our Yellowstone adventure. Would definitely recommend staying here!

I didn’t completely realize that there wasn’t a shower until we got there. I wouldn’t recommend more than a one night stay unless you are okay with that. Katy did provide us with an offsite location/solution for that. All in all the location was great and Bozeman is a great little town to visit.

This location is just the perfect distance from Downtown only a couple miles . But honestly if I was blindfolded getting there I would say it was another city.

You can see how much thought and effort has been put into making this a great place to stay. The bed is so comfortable - I slept like a rock and the bedding was soft and warm. There were options for both warming and cooling the cabin, so it can be set to whatever temperature is comfortable for you. Don't let the lack of running water deter you - a big carafe of drinking water was chilled and waiting in the fridge for me. The bathroom was super clean and smelled fresh, and they created a makeshift sink (that worked perfectly) so you can wash hands with soap and water. You can't beat the location, as it is only a couple minutes from groceries, restaurants, and shops in the downtown area, yet is perched just outside the hustle and bustle on a beautiful, serene property. I was even greeted by neighing horses as I arrived. 10/10 would stay again!"

Stayed with kids","Our stay at the Cowboy Up Cabin was great! The cabin had everything our family with 3 little kids needed to sleep comfortably and make meals for 3 nights. Location was private, on the west side of Bozeman. It was about a 15-20 minute drive to most of the activities we did. Kate communicated well, and left us some personal/thoughtful touches. Would stay here again."

Can’t imagine a better way to enjoy Bozeman and the Montana countryside both. Woke to the sound of horses, watched deer graze in a far field at evening time. 20 minutes to get wherever we wanted to be in town. I’d happily stay again. Kate was a great host."

My wife and I were lucky enough to spend several days at Cowboy Up! during our son’s graduation from Montana State University (Engineer with honors 🙂)…the memories will last a lifetime.

Stayed a few nights","The CowboyUp Cabin was wonderful! We found it to be super clean, quiet, comfortable, and convenient. We found we had everything we needed. We stayed for four days while in town visiting family. Three beautiful and friendly horses kept us company right outside the cabin and it was awesome looking out the kitchen window to grazing horses. My children especially loved petting and visiting them.
Unfortunately, our stay was during a serious heat wave with temps in the mid 90s (really hot for Bozeman) and the cabin doesn’t have central A/C (neither do most places in the area). It does have a very nice window A/C unit in the main bedroom, ceiling fans, and an extra portable fan in the 2nd bedroom. We were able to leave the windows open at night, run the fans, window A/C, and stay comfortable.
Highly recommend the CowboyUp Cabin for your next stay in Bozeman, especially if you want that country feel."

Stayed one night","The best airbnb I've ever stayed at. Finding where to go is easy, you can park right next to the door and the neighborhood is beautiful and feels safe. The interior is spacious and clean, there's lots of amenities and the room is also beautiful. I had an issue connecting to the wifi when I got there and messaged Emilee and Chris, they responded within minutes and fixed my problem. The airbnb was also the cheapest one of all my stays on my roadtrip. Can't stress enough how great this stay was."

The only reason it got 4/5 stars was there was no really cozy place to sit besides the bed, and because they have a glass door to the bathroom, when my husband got up in the night to use it- it lit the whole studio up and woke me and our baby up. Just something to keep in mind, but truly an accommodating and wonderful stay!"

There was a great kitchen and super close to the airport. Unfortunately our stay fell within the week that Yellowstone was flooded and we couldn’t get out for a day. We had asked for a refund for that first day of our stay that we missed, only because it was a very extreme event, and that didn’t work out. We didn’t realize how important that option is with extreme weather that alters a trip and we learned very quickly what an important option that is to have with all of the other airbnbers around us getting help from their hosts. Other than that, we had a good stay."

Stayed a few nights","The only disappointing thing about Chris and Emilee's space is that we couldn't enjoy it longer! The studio is light, airy, and spacious, with windows on each side and minimalist decor. The space is very clean. The kitchen area is well-equipped with an electric stove, small fridge/freezer, microwave, Keurig coffeemaker, and all the pots, pans, dishes, and utensils needed. After seeing the kitchen, we decided not to go out to eat. There is a chain grocery store about five minutes away with all the necessities, including fresh, ready-to-heat meals. The bed is comfortable and the bedding feels luxurious. There is a desk with good lighting, and Wi-Fi works well. The bathroom towels are also nice and soft. Communication with the hosts was excellent! They responded within a few minutes and answered my questions fully.
While I would highly recommend Chris and Emilee's studio, there are a few things to consider. I think this space is for the travelers who are looking for a place to unwind after a busy day or to get work done without distractions. The studio is located in a quiet neighborhood, not within walking distance to shops/restaurants/activities. We found the nights to be dark, peaceful, and relaxing. There is no television in the studio, but the hosts have thoughtfully provided books pertaining to Montana, Yellowstone, and outdoor themes in general. Also, the space is above a garage, so it may not be the right space for anyone who can not negotiate stairs.
It was the perfect space for us! Thank you so much, Chris and Emilee!"

Eventually we decided to stay with them and luckily the water was back on the second evening. Their place is clean warm and quiet. We even saw deers passing by in the evening :-) The kitchen is fully equipped so we could prepare breakfast and lunch by ourselves. We would love to come back if we visit big sky again.

Stayed a few nights","Well, this was probably the BEST airbnb I've ever stayed in. Immaculately clean, all the amenities one could need, even great, local coffee was included! Though let me explain who this airbnb is ideal for:
1) If you are a writer looking to finish your book/screenplay, this provides a wonderfully private, comfortable space away from the world to do so. Amazing desk and chair and, best of all, NO distracting TV - yay!
2) If you're someone who just wants to experience Montana, you're a 10 minute drive from Bozeman, a 30 minute drive from Livingston, a hour north of Big Sky, etc. It's got this perfect combination of feeling like you're out in the middle of nowhere (it sure gets quiet at night), but not entirely (the closest supermarket is 2 miles away).
I predict this will be one of those places that's always booked, considering it's location, price, and how lovely it is. If you want to see Montana, I can't imagine finding a better spot!"

Centrally located to everything Southwest Montana has to offer, this space has everything you need and is the perfect home base for all your adventures while visiting Bozeman. Meghan and Matt are beyond welcoming and communicative, the neighbors are great, and there are tons of walking trails around the neighborhood. If peace, quiet, and safety is a priority, this is the place."

Stayed a few nights","A very comfortable and convenient suburban location. We had to split our time between work and play so the location worked great with easy access to places around the valley, Big Sky, and the airport. Less than an hour to Big Sky so easy to make first chair at Madison base. 15 minutes to the airport so easy to catch an early morning flight. Quiet place to work and fast internet speeds. Everything you need to cook for yourself if you want. In on business, it works great for work and easily let’s you sneak in some play. Megan has things we’ll thought out and organized for an easy nonstressful stay."
