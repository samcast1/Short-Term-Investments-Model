Stayed one night","AC is fantastic , this weekend was the 55th Selma Jubilee and all hotels were booked, my pageant sisters and I had to opportunity to stay two nights at Woolworths loft. As this was not my first time staying , it was my sister queens and they really enjoyed being close to downtown , parking was perfect , we ate lunch at downtowners which was walking distance, and in route of the parade. This visit made it my 3rd stay and I’m making it a priority to visit each loft ."

Stayed one night",This is an ideal place to stay if you want to really experience Selma. Location is on the main street just a short walk to the NPS Center and the bridge. The rooms are amazing in a nicely renovated historic building with lots of character and modern conveniences. Very comfortable. AC is a tremendous help with planning your stay. We did her sampler tour which helped get us oriented to the community. She had great recommendations of things to do and places to eat. Good information is also found in the room. Can not say enough positives and it is worth a stay in Selma if you want to appreciate the historic significance of this place.

But there is one bright spot, which is the Woolworth Lofts. Their owners have done a wonderful job of preserving and converting the building into splendid loft apartments, and a delightful design shop on the ground floor. It was a great place to stay. The host is a wonderful soul."

AC is a wonderful host who knows all of the local hot spots and can tell you all about Selma! Don't miss out on the opportunity to stay in the lofts! They are breathtaking and will make your stay unforgettable!!"

We were very pleased with our experience, and the accommodation exceeded our expectations. We highly recommend this Airbnb! It was very clean, spacious, located in a safe and quiet area not far from downtown."

Stayed with a pet",Beautiful home! Parking was the only thing I had a slight “inconvenience” with. If you have a bigger vehicle it’s kinda tight back there where they want people to park so you’re right ontop of each other if one care takes up a wide gap. (Which is what happened to me) She worked with me on checkout and having a package delivered day of checkout. She leaves cool snacks and goodies that are locally bought. Very friendly woman. Lovely furniture. Only downside was not many practical cooking I utensils. (Big spoons ans such) and the roads in that area are horrible. Major potholes so beware. Which is out of her control. I don’t blame the host. But if you’re staying in Selma. This Is in the safer nicer side of downtown. Would recommend 100% if you’re staying in this area. Oh and one bedroom has no tv and the other is like 20 inches. So bring your own. But I would def stay here again

The churches and temple are so beautiful and so many different types of architectural styles are represented. I was amazed by the sophistication of the different styles.

The building itself is beautiful, hardwood floors, high ceilings, stain glassed windows. The beds were very comfortable, and I had everything I needed. On a personal note about AC, the owner. She is such an inspiring human being. Woolworth Lofts not only provides a nice place to spend the night but also celebrates Selma and offers a healing place to explore some of America's traumatic history. AC helped me in ways that were above the call of duty for an owner as well. She was so generous towards my family and I after a traumatic personal event happened while we were staying in the loft. Her support and care during the early times of dealing with things was unbelievable. She is an angel, and she is the person to ask to guide you through the city of Selma. Thanks, AC!"

She went beyond the call of Host duty. We appreciated her kindness and thoughtfulness. She ensured we were doing well while staying at the lofts. We loved the lofts and the history that came along with them. We will visit again and without a doubt will be staying at the Woolworth Lofts.

Stayed one night","This apartment is simply adorable! The decorations are perfect and made the apt feel cozy and comfortable. We only stayed for one short night. We didn’t arrive until 9:30 pm but the apt was well-lite and entering was a breeze using the very clear instructions sent from AC. The apt is located downtown, and we had our concerns about safety at first but felt okay once we entered. We left early the next morning so we didn’t get to enjoy the space and views as much as we would have liked to. At any rate, we enjoyed our stay. The one thing that I would like people to know is that this apt is located in a noisy area — or, it happened to be noisy on the night we stayed (a Friday night). There were emergency vehicles (with sirens) and loud vehicles that passed by the apartment numerous times during the night. The noise maker provided didn’t help with these loud sounds but did help with regular street noise. I felt like traffic was beyond the host’s control but wanted others to know about this."

We love the authentic and historic you get inside the whole building. AC did a great job renovating the whole 2nd floor and in my opinion there is no better place to stay in Selma. Just a few minutes away from everything that is worth seeing in this charming city. We'd love to come back someday."

We arrived a little later than expected and it was a bit rainy on arrival day so we weren’t able to explore quite as much as we had planned, but that turned out perfect because Woolworth was absolutely lovely for a movie night in. So comfy & cozy, and being able to have our dog seriously made it feel like our home away from home.
The host went above and beyond in so many ways = offered so much info about the area & even has an app where you can purchase the audio + directions for self guided tours! They also had great custom goats milk soaps!"

In addition we took advantage of ACs, walking tours of Selma, in addition to our preplanned visits along the civil rights Trail. Our stay could not have been more perfect. You do have to be able to carry luggage up and down stairs, that was fine. We would highly recommend."

The bed was a bit too squeaky for us, and I didn’t get much sleep because of it. The building is old, so we heard every footstep of anyone else in the building. The sound machine was truly a game changer- it was very much appreciated!
I’d recommend the loft for people who aren’t light sleepers and want to stay in Selma for a few nights."

AC knows so many people working to transform Selma into a cultural destination, growing forward from the past, and loves to share what they are doing. It is also a great place from which to visit the community murals by artist Tres Taylor in several small cities close by, including three in Selma.
I would definitely stay there again!!"

AC is a wonderful host who goes above and beyond for her guests through genuine hospitality. Her knowledge and passion for Selma and the surrounding region runs deep and her enthusiasm for sharing this special place makes for a special Airbnb experience. There is also a vibrant community and art space beneath the lofts and we had the good fortune of joining an event while there, which drew a wonderful group of people whom we were lucky to meet.

The only reason for a 4 instead of 5 star review was that there was a storm that night and around 4:00am the skylight began leaking and the sound of the dripping kept me up. I was assured this would get fixed and I believe it will. I would definitely stay again.

We were happy to find the Woolworth lofts on Airbnb, with the kitchen we needed. Keep in mind this building is well over 100 years old, and that's the charm of it! High ceilings, tall arched windows, and decorated tastefully. AC was extremely helpful with our every request. We stayed in Loft ""A"". If you love the glorious sunshine in the morning, Lofts A or B are wonderful choices. Would definitely go back again if the opportunity presents."

Stayed a few nights","(This is a cross-posted booking for several of Ac’s lofts). This is our second year booking the Woolworth Lofts in Selma for a work event in Greensboro. Everything from the booking process to check-in and our overall stay have always been A+. My personal favorite part (aside from the location) is how inviting the environment of the lofts are— there are numerous pieces of art throughout, many which are for sale, which is such a simple yet thoughtful part. I love being able to take a piece of my experience in Selma home with me! Would definitely recommend to anyone and definitely plan to return again :)"

The view from the front windows is picturesque and the bright lighting over the parking area made things feel safe and secure. Check-in was a breeze and our hosts were very gracious in showing us around and being available as needed for communication about anything. Will definitely stay again on future trips - this is a great find in a great location in this historic city!

Stayed with kids","What an amazing place to stay! For starters parking was excellent. We had a front row spot right by our door everyday. As you walk up the stairs and into the hallway you’re greeted with beautiful hardwood floors and lovely light fixtures that take you back in time. At this point you can already tell this building was meticulously restored to its original state.
The room itself has a great amount of natural light. Lay down in the bed and look up to take in the most gorgeous skylight you’ve ever seen. That was hands down my favorite feature. And don’t you worry about street traffic waking you up. The room has a sound machine that drowns if all out. A very nice touch, and something you can remove from your packing list.
The living space is open with very large windows that have a touch of stained glass at the top. Peek out the windows to take in views of the pristine Dallas County Library and a pretty little fountain at city hall. At this point you’ll be torn between hanging out inside the loft or hitting the streets of Selma to meet some of the nicest people around!
Everything in the loft is clean, freshly painted, and uniquely decorated. You can’t get this level of comfort and style at a hotel! Come visit!"

It is beautifully decorated with a light and airy feel. The tall ceilings make the space feel much larger than it is. There is an incredible surprise when you lay on the bed and look up…I will keep it a surprise. This is a must stay if going to Selma.
AC is an amazing host!!! She was there every time I had to contact her. I even lost the keys….and she was so accommodating and kind…..while I interrupted her vacation.
I can not say enough about my experience here. I will definitely be returning to Selma, and I hope Loft A is available for me yo stay in again."

The lofts were clean, well lit (fabulous windows), had comfortable furniture (including the beds) and Loft B had the perfect kitchen table for family card games and late-night snacks. AC (owner) responded immediately to questions by text, and it was fun to run into her around town. AC's check-in/out instructions were clear and concise, and again, her phone number is everywhere if you have a question. Enjoy your stay!"

The Airbnb Clean, Very spacious, Extremely comfortable bed, large walk in closet, large bathroom with double sinks, several places to sit, nice sectional for relaxing and watching TV, and it's beautifully decorated! Taylor is an outstanding host. She is very prompt in responding to any questions or concerns you may have. Taylor was even thoughtful and left history about the city of Selma along with suggestions of places to visit. The area is very peaceful and quiet. There is a nice decorative sitting area for lounging and relaxing out front. If you are looking for an amazing place to stay for a great value not too far from the grocery store, restaurants, fuel stations, you will not be disappointed!! Please give Taylor's place a try you will be glad you did! Thank You Taylor for providing a home away from home feel."

Stayed a few nights","Talk about ""Community"", well I was actually referred to Taylor's prestigious listing by another ABNB owner LaQueena. A last minute emergency arose with my booking with LaQueena. She communicated with me every step of the way. I literally drove through a rain and hail storm getting to my destination from Texas to Alabama. LaQueena and Taylor worked together like true professional business owners who value their customers.
It didn't take long for them to collaborate and connect so that my family's lodging was secured. Initially my stress levels were high, but after receiving immediate responses from Taylor (Love this host) and LaQueena, my stress simply melted away because I knew things were going to be ok.
There are hundreds of ABNB business owners out there, but what separates the elite from the rest is how they respond when things go wrong. These two hosts are among the elite, and Queens Palace was the icing on the cake, as my family LOVED this place!
Thank you to my two angels!!"

NO NO NO! It was NO STOVE and you really have No privacy. I brought my husband to see his family that he haven’t saw in a decade and was going to cook them a nice meal but that didn’t happen. IMMEDIATELY pulling into this driveway WE FELT WE WERE BEING WATCH! It’s definitely not worth the price that we paid IT WAS THE NO STOVE FOR ME! PLEASE MAKE SURE TO READ THEIR RULES AND POLICY FIRST!!! The place is very CLEAN AND NEAT."

Stayed a few nights","I needed a place to attend my oldest brother's wedding and Taylor's place is just as described and shown. Very clean, smells nice, and comfortable... Side note, I'm am particular about certain things when staying or eating at places outside of home- especially now due to Covid. I'd contacted 2 places with questions about their spaces and got late responses. Being new to Airbnb, I was worried about my timing, how things work, and climbing stairs, etc. Taylor promptly responded and gave clear instructions for everything needed before and after booking to where there was no need for a thing for my entire stay! And no worries as Taylor's steps are well padded and not steep which takes a lot of strain off the body. I found my little brother booked one of the places I contacted (reason for the late response), yet Taylor's place was nice, so comfy, cozy and clean that my little brother and sister-in-law with my 10-month old niece preferred hanging out there during our downtime instead of their Airbnb😁. My brother's place was uncomparable and we'd not hesitate to book with Taylor if ever in Selma again!😎"

Taylor has all the details down pat. Keypads for easy self check in, signage for important things and she even left a few drinks and snacks. I’ll definitely stay again."

Stairway don't meet code either & in desperate need of painting. Upstair Bedroom ceilings coming apart w/large old water stains. One with open ceiling vent. Sisters couldn't sleep per felt a critter would come through vent. Spider webs on ceilings/walls/light fixtures. Saw a roach as well. Upstairs' bath inside top cabinetry look awful. No bathcloths instead bathRAGS. A bath rag had huge stain. I couldn't use it. Very little used liquid soap & dish detergent/with Perhaps 1 or 2 ounces each. No one could get sleep to include me. Fortunately, I brought my own sheets/pillow & made a small corner on sofa but sofa had smell. KITCHEN: Floor sinking/Not to Code. Large plastic spoons need r"

The house was super clean and is very livable with three comfortable bedrooms.
Yes the house is old and it has not been refursbished to modern standards but if you look for an authentic experience in a neighbor riched of history then this is the place.
Thanks Denis for your support in local communities. We'll be back!"

Stayed one night","I cannot, in good conscience, recommend 422 Lapsley St as a place to stay. The poor air quality, cockroach/insect infestation, lack of cleanliness, and unaccountable co-host made our experience truly dreadful. Save yourself the disappointment and find a different accommodation option in the area.
The overall condition of the property was appalling forcing us to leave prematurely.
The air quality within the rental was absolutely deplorable. As soon as we entered the premises, a stale and mildew odor engulfed the entire home, making it difficult to breathe and triggering allergies for some members of my family.
We encountered cockroaches scurrying across the walls, making it impossible to relax or feel at ease leaving us disgusted and repulsed.
Accumulated dust and webs were visible throughout the property and urine stains were on the sofa.
The co-host responded dismissively, brushing off our complaints and placing the blame on us. This was a terrible experience."

The bathroom sink upstairs didn't work, so that was inconvenient. I was surprised at how dilapidated the town of Selma is, although part of the damage is due to a tornado in 1/2023. Despite this, I was grateful to stay in this historic house in such a historic town. If only the walls could speak!"

Denise had the house clean and warmed up for us during a stretch of cold weather. Denise is very responsive and reasonable about house rules. I thought the house was clean and didn’t see any evidence of pets having been there.

Stayed with a pet","My husband and I enjoyed our stay in this large historic home, and so did our little dog. There are many architectural details in the home to admire. Having owned an old Victorian home ourselves, we know that it “is not perfect” as the listing states, but we felt that this place was perfect in its imperfection; if you love old houses and can understand that, this is a great place to have a relaxing stay. The super comfortable bed in the downstairs bedroom gave us restorative sleep and its attached full bathroom was cute and cozy. The fully equipped kitchen helped us feel completely at home as we prepared meals, and the living room and outdoor seating areas (especially the front porch!) were great places to relax and soak up the charm of the area. The home is located near the historic sites in Selma and is a great base for exploring. Denise and her husband are great communicators and super helpful. We are so glad we stayed at their sweet old place."

Stayed with kids",house was nice being an older home. there were only 2 small hand towels left out for 5 guests being there and coffee pot had old coffee and coffee grounds left in it .not sure if a professional cleaning service comes if so they were not doing their services properly overall price could be less due to lack of towels toilet paper and cleanliness. host communication was timely so it may be due to the cleaning service they use . would stay again if a little cheaper

Stayed a few nights","This is a beautiful old house and we loved staying here. The rooms are large and airy with nice areas to relax; we did not have occasion to cook on this visit, but the kitchen is well appointed and would be fine to prepare meals to enjoy in the dining room; bed was very comfortable and we slept well; I loved soaking in the clawfoot tub upstairs!
This is a work in progress and, with some devoted restoration work, I am sure will be a showplace. There was a plumbing issue downstairs which I am certain is being remedied now. I love the peacock accents around the house, the unusual clock upstairs, the interesting faceplates on some of the electrical sockets, the brick patio, and the front-porch swing.
We are thinking about a return visit in the fall and would enjoy staying here again. Denise and Terrence are very good hosts."

This was also the first Airbnb I've had that had its own ADT alarm system that we could arm at nights and when we left which made us feel safe and sound. The private back porch area was our own little oasis. The owners Denise and TV are the sweetest, most accommodating people ever! Would definitely recommend this place for any Selma bound travelers."

We were able to cozy up and enjoy the treats she so kindly left for us, and were pleasantly surprised to find such a great place at the very last minute. I found the cleaning fee to be a bit high, but the space was very clean and welcoming. The upstairs was closed for renovations but when it reopens I'm sure this place would be perfect for family reunions, weekend getaways with a group, and beyond. Thank you Denise!"

Taylor is super friendly, gives very thorough instructions the day before your check in and She always promptly responds back to any questions you may have. Taylor is also very thoughtful she provides snacks and water along with other drinks like coffee if your a coffee drinker.. The price you pay to stay is very reasonable!! The location very peaceful and quiet. If you're looking for a home away from home this is most definitely the place. This is my third time staying at Taylor's and anytime her place is available I will continue to stay.

The area is very peaceful and quiet. There is a local grocery store, gas stations, and restaurants not far at all if you need anything. Taylor's is an amazing Host. Any questions you may have she promptly responds. Taylor provides you with recommendations of places to visit along with any valuable information you may need for your time at her place. There are also amenities in case you leave something behind. The kitchen has what you need if you want to warm up food. Taylor also provides a snack as a welcome gesture.

It's out in the country, but so is everything down there. It's set in a little grouping of guest houses so you won't feel isolated but you definitely have your privacy. A lot of thought was put into this cute little place to make it welcoming and comfortable. I especially loved the little outdoor area that's screen tented against the bugs, equipped with a fan, and with Alexa to play your favorite music. What a lovely way to end or start the super hot days. Like sittin' on the front porch. I'll definitely look to stay again."

You can tell that she absolutely cares about her guest, and went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed. From the beginning of the stay, all the way to the end, we felt the warmest and most welcomed with all the little extra added, touches and benefits that this place provided along with the amazing host. Thank you for being a host on Airbnb!!"

It was perfect for sharing meals with a large kitchen and dining table, and the sitting room was cozy with quiet mornings with a coffee, newspaper, sunshine and birdsong. The bedrooms were comfortable and we had great sleep. The neighborhood is quiet and neighborly and easy to access. Angela, the host, was friendly, helpful, checked if we needed anything, and fast in responding, and when we had sudden car trouble she came through quickly with helping us extend our stay and offering local suggestions to help us. Thank you for a wonderful stay."

Your communication on directions, access, and wifi was impeccable. This was a very clean and spacious AirBnB equipped with everything we needed especially since we got in late. The snacks was much needed since everything was closed. NOW THAT'S HOW YOU HOST!!!😊 You are definitely a great host and the information on local things to do was a great addition. We had a great time at this Airbnb. The communication was super easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does on the pictures. Even better in person. (Please check it out) The neighborhood is very conveniently located downtown and safe. Would absolutely recommend anyone to stay there!
We still couldn't get over how nice the place is decorated and the (3) bedrooms was super bargain for 2 people vs a hotel stay. The variety of coffee and teas was an absolute joy especially winding down in the evening.
We even had time to put some steaks on the grill.
Please stop and stay here! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!👍👍👍"

When the hot water went out, it was kind of late and he responded quickly. Came and checked it out and we were back up and running. I would definitely recommend this property. 10 out of 10 stars."

He made sure that we had everything we needed and more throughout the entire time of our stay. It is definitely spacious for your family and neighborhood is very quiet and also close to local fast food spots. I would definitely recommend this home to anyone who travels or visits to Selma. We would definitely let him host us again.

I thought I would not be checking in until the next morning, because of a canceled flight but I was able to make a stand by flight, and arrived at my schedule time, well, he never gave me the code to get in (I should have gotten it 24 hours before check in) so sat outside in the heat for an hour trying to get a code, to find out the place had not been cleaned cause he let the quest before me stay later and waited to clean up, had to clean ourselves in order to sleep that night, He did come the next day and clean and it looked great, however I requested at last a half of a day to be refund, because of what happened only refunded $25"

This home is large, plenty of amenities, access to the city of Selma is great. Neighborhood is safe and we loved being here. It took the sting of being displaced away a bit.
Quinton was attentive and very kind to us. He ensured the home was clean and even allowed us to get in a bit earlier because he had no where to go.
This was a really great experience."

Group trip","I am a native of Selma and returned home to visit family. Not enough room at my childhood house for my family so we opted for AirBnB. The tech house was great! It is located in a quiet, safe neighbourhood, which was good considering Selma's overall decline and increased crime since I moved away in the late 80s.
All the rooms had very comfortable beds, the bathrooms were well-stocked, as was the kitchen. Quinton gave us a pre-visit call as we were en route to the house, and talked us through some housekeeping issues, which was very helpful.
I would highly recommend the ""tech house"" for anyone visiting Selma with a large family."

The host was on the spot with his communications and welcomed us with complimentary snacks, drinks etc. The house is in a great location where you can get to the main streets that have all of the conveniences within minutes. We did however have some things that happened that inconvenienced our stay such as a late check-in and a couple of other things that I would not mention here because I feel they may have been beyond the hosts control Along with the late check-in. Upon reading all the reviews before our stay, I feel like we just got all the bad luck. However, we plan to frequent this area in the near future and will keep this house on our list as one of our favorites. I am confident that this visit was just a fluke."

Stayed a few nights","The host's write-up for this home is accurate, and the home is roomy and clean. Quinton was a wonderful host!
The A/C worked great, there are TV's in each bedroom with streaming services already hooked up, ceiling fans throughout, and the kitchen is very well appointed. Two bedrooms (queens) on first floor, and two (queen, single) on the 2nd floor. Quinton provides some drinks and snacks, which is very convenient, and all the usual amenties were there as well. The beds were comfortable, as were the rest of the furnishings. The new hot water heater provided the best pressure/volume to the bathub/shower in the hall bathroom, but it was also acceptable in the others 2 showers. Towels and bedding were fresh and soft.
Easy to find and you park in the off-street driveway. Close to anything you will want to do locally. You will not go wrong if you stay in Quinton's offering here! I brought 2 people who had never done AirBnB before, and they are now sold on the concept."

Stayed a few nights","Great location for direct access to Selma. Quiet, well-kept neighborhood of apartment duplexes.
Inside, the air felt nice, cool, and fresh with solid AC.
Enjoyed maps and rustic feel, and appreciated the rustic headboard lamps in the master suite for evening reading.
The 2 bed/2 BR each, which had a classic and simple design.
Mattress and bed/BR linen choice was most disappointing.
While it beat the alternative of sleeping in a tent for the entirety of the [wet] weekend, the full-sized, stiff boxspring wasn't comfortable--especially if sharing a bed. Felt like sleeping on very* cheap linen and pillows, but was clean.
Same with the white towels and rags in the BRs, but unfortunately very cheap rags/towels do not handle wear well from previous use, though presumed clean, of course. Quality in these regards goes a long way.
Freezer handle wasn't secure and was like halfway popped off, but was clean and cold nonetheless.
For the location and price, it really was a solid BnB!"

Stayed one night","This historic loft (Joan Baez stayed here when she came to the March on Selma) is beautifully restored and looks out over downtown Selma. High-reaching ceilings, beautiful stained-glass windows, great art, magnificent light and very comfortable. Easy to get anywhere in town. You are right downtown, so street and occasional train noise nearby was present, but Ac provides bedside ""noise"" machines to help soothe any of that away and it was not a problem for us. Ac was very communicative, helpful and provided all sorts of suggestions for tours (she has her own self-guided tour that she makes available in addition to lots of eating, shopping and other tour guide suggestions), and she encourages guests to try to look at Selma in a different light than what people think of when they think of Selma, Alabama. It was a great stay. There are stairs to climb, FYI, so pack/prepare accordingly (it's an old, historic building!)"

The Coffee Shop across the street was great and super friendly. We were enjoying the loft so much we picked up takeout (at Lannie's bbq) and stayed in! We were able to peak in a few of the other rooms, and we would be happy in any one of them. Sure hope to come back! Thank you AC for creating such a wonderful place to stay!"

Stayed a few nights","If you want to submerge yourself in the history and culture of the South, you’re at the epicenter when staying at the Woolworth Lofts in Selma. AC, who owns and operates this small collection of units renovated from the old Woolworth Building, has added her loving touch – creating a cozy hideaway (mine was Suite B) tucked off the main street that is both a traveler's refuge and itself a space that speaks to the historical importance of Selma and contemporary elements of its location along the Alabama River. In fact, you'll enjoy all the creature comforts of an upscale Airbnb – but with plenty of room and amenities of a spacious apartment you'll wish you owned! There's no better guide than AC to point you in the direction of significant landmarks, and to introduce you to local characters that literally bridge the past of the Edmund Pettis Bridge to the present, as Selma continues struggling to shape its identity in the modern world. Don't miss out on the next door ""5 and Dime"" (of course) art gallery – an expansive space that rotates a variety of award-winning artists on a monthly basis. Art from the heart, I came to think of it: local artists, including several important figures, who represent the fiber of the region, creating art that lets through creases of light through their mostly three-dimensional work. Character, cleanliness and culture -- my 3 Cs (+ AC!) when traveling, and the cornerstones of an amazing experience you'll enjoy when you make the Woolworth Loft your home in Selma for a brief visit (mine was three very full days) or a long-term stay. Highly recommended."

Stayed one night","Ac has created such a special, artistic, and unique place to stay while in Selma, and my friend and I enjoyed staying in Suite B. The stylish furnishings in the beautiful space made for a comfortable respite. The bathroom was roomy and was nice as a shared space, and the master bedroom was peaceful and cozy, and the second bedroom (with two twins) was also comfortable. Note, the photos for this suite don't really reveal all this space has to offer -- the main suite was large and gorgeous; the second bedroom was small, but plenty comfortable with two twins. The location was perfect for walking through town, and parking was free and plentiful when we were there. Would definitely stay at the Woolworth Lofts again when visiting Selma. Thank you, Ac!"

We were in town for a two day basketball tournament and with having only one uniform, the washer and dryer came in handy.
AC mentions the noise machine to cancel out the sound of the train whistle. But even the sound machine couldn’t cancel out the street noise. This is totally out of AC’s control, and the only reason I mention it is so future visitors can bring ear plugs. Unfortunately folks treat Broad Street like their own personal Talladega."

Stayed with kids","Suite B is where you want to spend your time in Selma. Natural sunlight floods the space with happiness and warmth from the huge windows that are capped off with stained glass. The loft will become your personal art gallery as you enjoy work from local artists on every wall. But please don't stop there. Look around at the trim and the furnishings. I'm convinced the twin beds were constructed from wood reclaimed from the space. Add to that a bathtub made for soaking and relaxing. I also encourage you to partake in the book selection. My kids and I enjoyed reading from the selection of local books. And as a mom let me add that the small touches like white noise makers and blinds in the windows and a fridge and freezer and natural soap products and the washer and dryers available down the hall and having a private locked space made my stay safe and relaxing. Please make the Woolworth Lofts a part of your stay and take the opportunity to become a part of this community, looking for the unexpected finds like sun print artwork on fences and paintings under the bridge supports. 😍"

This was my second stay at the Lofts (Suite A the first time, then Suite B). Both are comfortable, open art-filled spaces with interesting street views and amazing light. The only negative is that the street noise is very loud, especially at night. The white noise machines in every bedroom help cancel out the noise. I’m looking forward to future stays at the Lofts."

Stayed a few nights","Suite B is a private apartment with full kitchen on the second floor of an old building on Broad Street. It’s close to the Edmund Pettus bridge. There is ample parking in front or the side. It’s easier to back out if you’re parked on the side.
There is a flight of stairs to ascend to the second floor. The old building has creaky - but solid - wooden floors that I enjoyed listening to. Suite B is on the corner so you have expansive views on two sides. I love being able to see outside. The blinds close for privacy when you want.
The place is remodeled and in great shape. The plumbing fixtures are first class! The internet service is fast, 100mb plus. There are many nice touches, the host did a great job.
I will caution future guests about the street noise. Broad Street is a major highway with frequent vehicle traffic. The host provides sound machines in each bedroom that help, but do not eliminate the street noise. Small price to pay for a wonderful location, but worth being prepared for. I travel with a 20” box fan; placed beside the bed I slept all night without issues.
Recommended. I will look for availability here the next time I’m in Selma."

Stayed a few nights","AC's place at Woolworth Lofts was one of the best airbnb experiences i've had! The units are in the center of historic Selma, and you can't help but root for a revival of the beautiful city. We spent a few days working from unit B, and loved the high ceilings, antique furniture, and amazing light that came through the windows in each room. The wifi was fantastic for two of us working with video calls and whatnot.
There's been so much great work to the building, and it has a ton of charm. Note that there are three beds in the place - a queen, two twin daybeds, and a pullout from the couch. AC was a great host, and was an awesome person to discuss life and its complexities with. I would also extend the recommendation to stay here if you're also looking at getting an airbnb in Montgomery or Birmingham, as there's so much more charm in Selma in my opinion."

Stayed a few nights","This is an outstanding lodging option for anyone who is visiting Selma or the surrounding area. Suite B is spacious with plenty of space for a family. The kitchen has all the essentials to cook at home, with a large table where everyone can gather together. Tastefully decorated, the owner has highlighted local artists and Selma's history. The Lofts are a quick walk from a coffee shop, the National Parks office, and the Edmund Pettus Bridge. We are looking forward to our next stay at the Woolworth Lofts!"

Stayed one night","If you’re in Selma, this is THE place to stay! I stayed here as I was evacuating from Hurricane Ida & had no idea where I was even going. Ac is the best host I’ve had on Airbnb & I travel frequently. The space is cozy, clean, & decorated beautifully. Ac even has art for sale on the walls! I learned so much about Selma by all of the books on the coffee table.
Thanks again, Ac!"

Stayed one night","Exceedingly comfortable, exceptionally clean and convenient Airbnb. One block from the Edmund Pettus Bridge, one block from the good coffee shop, tucked inside the Historic District with abundant parking - it really couldn't be any better. Owned and staffed by great people helping to build the future of Selma. We absolutely loved it and can't wait to return."

Stayed a few nights","The place is really beautiful and has a lot of space to hang out, which is what we needed. We used the kitchen and kitchen table quite a bit and it was nice to hang in the living room.
It’s also really convenient to many historical sites. The beds were comfortable and the shower is roomy.
AC is easy to communicate with and open to suggestions, and I mentioned that the bathroom needs hooks and places to put your toiletries, and I’m sure she’ll work to make that happen."

Stayed one night","It was a blessing in disguise that our airbnb reservation was cancelled on us at the last minute, and in a mad hunt for a place to stay, ran across Ac's place.
As a former member of a historical society and a real estate developer, this place made me giddy in its redevelopment. Ac did it RIGHT!
Utilizing the existing bones, the unit is well designed to maximize the high ceilings, oozes charm, full of local details and art that you wanna buy for your own house, plus high on the list, super CLEAN, modernized and made me wish we had a few more days to stay and explore Selma.
If you need a place to sleep in Alabama, this is it!"

Stayed a few nights",We rented a handful of the lofts for Alabama Audubon’s Black Belt Birding Festival in Greensboro! It was a great experience staying at the lofts. AC was an excellent host and was so thorough with providing check in/out information. Such a wonderful experience in a beautiful town.

Stayed a few nights","This place is a great reason to plan a trip to Selma. Great, clean and vibrant space to explore a town that has deep and hard fought history. I would totally advise that everyone get a chance to see this special and important landmark town. AC is a great host and gets everything just right. Perfect accommodations! Everyone I met in the town was real warm and friendly. I'd definitely stay at AC's place again if I return."

Stayed a few nights",I love Woolworth Lofts. The Cadillac Loft is my favorite one. It’s very spacious and so clean. I recommend any of the lofts they are all unique in their own way. This is my home away from home in Selma.

Stayed with kids","This inviting space provides comfort, functionality, and convenience. The renovations tastefully retained the vintage character of the original structure, while mindful upgrades have kept kitchen and bathroom appliances and bedding, top notch.
The hostess was equally endearing and pleasant. She communicates in a clear, thorough, and kind manner.
We felt appreciative to have a turn to stay in this special, well cared for space."
