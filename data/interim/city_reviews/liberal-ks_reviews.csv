This place was amazing I have never felt so at home in an air bnb before!! The owners thought of every little thing we might need which was amazing. The welcome book had clear instructions on what do when checking out with used things in the home. The guest book was an awesome creative touch:) the house was very very clean and smelled so so nice. I have so much to say but I will leave it at THIS HOME WAS AMAZING!! If you’re looking through the options for Meade stop at this one, this house is exactly what you need for your stay!!

Initially, I was a thrown off by being so close to the train but it quickly became part of the charm. In addition, the dirt roads and sprawling fields, gorgeous sunrises and sunsets…. makes this hideaway a MUST place to stay.
Renae was a fantastic host, quick to respond and ready to answer any questions or concerns. If I’m in the area again, I will for sure plan to stay here."

Stayed with a pet","Kade and Ellen's barn is my most favorite stay EVER ~ pictures cannot capture all the beauty!
The second I walked into the barn, I gasped at the wonderful smell!
Everything was pristine clean with soft linens and 5 star quality bedding. When you hop into the comfy beds, you'll once again smell the soft scent of the home.
My first night, it rained and I fell asleep listening to rain drops on a tin roof! The next morning, I enjoyed the sounds of happy birds as they dipped and dived in the nearby fields.
The cats are wonderful to watch and they are ""besties"" with the farm's fouls. But, it's the two working farm dogs I loved ~ they are friendly and will certainly greet you, but they are working to keep the farm animals (and guests) safe from the roving coyotes.
Kade and Ellen will make your stay absolutely perfect! Friendly, communicative, and just down right nice. Their family is simply darling and they go the extra mile just for you! Thank you so much for an awesome stay ❤️"

We were in town from Colorado with our dog for the dog show and wanted to catch up with some friends who live in Kansas and this was the perfect place to meet up! The barn is out in the middle of the country, not very many amenities around so plan ahead and bring groceries and entertainment as needed - but can always make the drive to Dodge city. There is a large amount of open grass space to play corn hole and other provided yard games, grill and relax! The interior of the barn was fantastic - what a fun way to remodel a milking barn into a living space. We had a great trip and if ever back in Kansas would stay there again!
Ps the hosts even offered us fresh eggs from their chickens! The hosts are fantastic, extremely responsive and welcoming without being around too much either! (Host live in house on property away from barn)"

There is a lot of great things about this place & the pictures don’t quite capture how beautiful it is inside & out. It’s also really nicely priced. My dad loved the family history shared about the property as he also runs a centennial family farm. Walking along the pasture with a cup of coffee while watching the cattle graze was very peaceful.
Downsides: the sewer is pretty strong smelling in both bathrooms & the scented laundry detergent is quite potent on the bedding. If you have no fragrance sensitivities you’ll be in good shape. Still a 5/5 stay for us. We’d recommend it!"

Stayed with a pet","We loved our stay. The setting is peaceful and quiet. There are good restaurants nearby as well as a grocery store, and Kelli was very responsive. I loved the architectural materials, many of which were reclaimed. Raised wood panel doors custom cut for headboards on beds and corrugated sheet metal for ceilings. The bathrooms were spotless and modern. There is lot of craftsmanship and attention to detail. We loved staying here with our dogs and hope to return with friends and family."

The value is fantastic for the available space and amenities. If one forgets anything, Kelli most likely has it available. She is a fantastic host, always available if needed. Lodge is always clean and decor enlightening to their ranching history. Local history available to be browsed should it be of interested. Ranch history is amazing. Each visit is greatly enjoyed. Great people to know with fantastic integrity. No such thing as a stranger. Enough cannot be said for the enjoyment had while here. Look forward to our next stay!

I figured I would at least check the OK panhandle or Southeastern Kansas area. Kelli's ranch home came up. Great reviews and only $40 a person. I must say this is gem of a deal. It sleeps up to 12, but I was solo traveling. Private, secluded ranch home. I wish I had people with me to share the space! This is an active ranch, that is surrounded by beautiful OK country side. Plenty of room inside and outside. They have everything you need to be comfortable. Washer and dryer. Grill outside if you want to have a cookout. Highly recommend this if you are in the area. Thank you Kelli for having an option like this for travelers!

Stayed about a week","Disclaimer: solo traveller.
As such, the place could host a dozen or more people. I felt bad because I underused the property. There is basically a west wing of rooms, but I hung out in the east wing. Quiet, peaceful, huge yard lined with trees. Deer, cattle, horses, storms on the plains, big full moons and stars.. SW meets great plains, so you get some pretty nice sunsets and such . Rescued a bird. We're friends now. Dorothy's house is a fun drive away Really just a nice place to reset.
The place is well stocked and the TV area can seat at least a dozen people. The kitchen area is huge as well. Sand dunes and lakes in town, with markets for all the basics, 15 minutes away.. Owners were accommodating and communicative. Warned me of a big storm that was fun to watch. Huge tree-lined yard with a creek 200 ft away. Clean, stocked with most everything you need, wifi and cable are solid.
Can't say much more. It's a true 5*"

Super clean, quiet and restful. We were able to walk around the ranch and down by the creek. Kelli gave accurate directions and had a snack basket, too!
It’s about 20 minutes from a grocery store, so I suggest stopping for food to cook beforehand."

Stayed one night","My pup and I absolutely loved it here! It is such a cool house and much bigger than it looks from the pictures or the outside of the house. I loved the decor and found it very cozy. This would be the coolest place ever for a big family getaway or a bachelor/bachelorette party if those are allowed. I bet older kids would love this place too. I would definitely stay here again.
Kelli was awesome helping us figure out everything, as we were coming with a Uhaul truck and trailer moving across the country. I didn’t even have to back up bc of the circular drive, haha.
Couldn’t recommend this place more highly!"

The house is incredible and has amazing history to it. It also comes with a walk in shower and a relaxing tub in another section of the house. The den with the TV is also incredible but you won't spend much time there if you love the outdoors. Plenty of animals as well on the land. They also have a handful of gentle and playful dogs that got along great with ours! Can't wait to come back again for a vacation"

However, my stay also includes full access to hi hunting lodge. Downstairs was a full kitchen, restroom and dining facilities. Upstairs was a wonderful, huge relaxation area, with tables, wood stove, pool table, sofas and TV. After two days of stomping down WIHA grass, C.J. offered a guided hunt, with him and his pointers. His dogs are great, and I knocked down a few birds. In the off times, C.J. and I had great conversations over coffee. He is a great host and went out of his way to insure I enjoyed my stay. I will keep in touch, and most likely return with family."

Staying here was more than just a place to sleep - definitely one of the highlights of our vacation. Peaceful and quiet, we enjoyed the fire pit each night, looked at the stars. One morning we took a long walk down the road and just took in the beauty of the countryside. Note that this is a hunting lodge with bunkhouse, so my husband and I had separate twin size bunks. We had fun because it was different. We slept really well. Plenty of hot water in the shower. The hunting lodge had everything a person could need: kitchen, bathrooms, living room with all the cable channels. Very charming place to stay."

The ambiance is fantastic with the charm that only a hunting lodge of this caliber can bring. The barn was warm and cozy with the Christmas trees up with lights still on. We enjoyed playing pool and a round of darts. The kitchen area was perfect for cooking our meal and pretty much anything we would have needed was there in the kitchen. All kinds of pots, pans, cutlery, etc, were present. Amenities were plentiful on toiletries, towels, bedding, etc. The sleeping arrangements were fun with each adult having their own bunk room. For me the bed was comfortable and the sleeping lodge was warm and very clean. I could go on and on about how fantastic our experience was at C.J.’s place! Do your self a favor and book this experience then you will know the definition of Kismet. God bless C.J. And his family. XO, The Hartman’s"

Stayed one night","This is a wonderful place to stay! We were looking for a place with space to run for my dog on a long-distance move. My dog loved running in the corn fields and it was very peaceful! It would have been nice to stay for a few days as it was completely set up with a lodge set up for cooking, pool and tv, but enjoyed the quick night. Great communication with C.J. too, though we never saw a soul the entire time we were there (which was great, too)."

Stayed one night","If you're looking for a quiet place well away from town or highways, this is for you. Arrive though, in daylight as we are talking dirt farm roads. Easy with google maps in daylight. Entrance is not the first 2 driveways, go round the first corner to the left and the barn and cabins are easily seen. CJ was quick to respond to any questions and I was very comfortable staying on his farm as a single female. I was fortunate enough to have him give me a tour of his farm. Clean and comfortable with all the basic needs. He was willing to help with any thing I might have needed. Bring all your food/drinks with you as it's a long way to a grocery store! I would stay here again if traveling this part of the country."

The shower worked well too, had abundant hot water. The bedroom had dark curtains and the neighborhood was quiet and safe.
It's a nice one-night place to stay. Didn't really watch TV or stayed very long, since we were trying to get back on the road early the next day.
The only item I would upgrade would be the cooking utensils, pots and pans. Also make sure you leave enough time to do all the dishes before you leave."

Jerry was quick to respond and answer questions. We ate at Cattlemen’s on Jerry’s recommendation and it was amazing. Had the chicken fried chicken and cat fish. Sweet workers.

Side note: you might check out Cattleman’s restaurant. The steaks we had were a treat."

Jerry was great to communicate with and responded to me very quickly. The house is on the second level so you have to walk steps, but they are inside and very wide. Being upstairs afforded us the use of a private deck overlooking the neighborhood, which proved very peaceful, watching squirrels and birds. Jerry made sure that there was coffee and creamer available for morning. Also although we did not use it, there is a washer and dryer downstairs. All in all a wonderful place."

Stayed with kids","It was nice to find a place near our friends to stay. It was spacious and unique so the kids loved the house. The kitchen was well stocked with nice pans and utensils to make our own meals. I hope you use my old school potato masher when there ❤️ because it got left behind by mistake. The abundance of two plate sets allowed us to not have to wash between meals too, so we spent more time visiting. The outside patio table allowed us to enjoy the weather and make a fall wreath. The bathrooms were stocked with clean linen and finding hairspray available in the bathroom saved the day. The large friendly cats were funny. The farm was a favorite of the kids and my daughter loved the calf but I strongly recommend children not be allowed to roam with a bbgun while the property is occupied. By the grace of God our stay ended well."

Stayed with kids","When we arrived we were extremely happy with our choice to stay there due to the house being spotless, spacious and peaceful. It was kid friendly as they had crayons and coloring books and kids puzzles which we appreciated due to having two kids under 3 with us. With the limited options in this area this has to be the best option by far and I would highly recommend. Matter of fact we booked it on our way home too and can’t wait to stay again"

There are 3 floors, each with their own sleeping area as well as an extra space to sit and relax. There is a large front porch to escape and a picnic bench out the backdoor. I was glad there was an enormous garage to park your vehicle. And the stars, oh my goodness, I think you could actually see other galaxies ( of course, I am not an astronomer).
You would be absolutely crazy to stay in a hotel if this place is available!"

The hostess had the cutest welcome sign, homemade chocolate banana nut bread, and we had access to farm fresh ground beef.
We highly recommend this Airbnb if you are traveling through the OK Panhandle and need a place to stop."

Stayed with kids","My family needed a place to spend the night on our drive through Kansas. We were given helpful instructions on how to find the place as the address in g-maps is insufficient. I was able to tag the spot on the map ahead of time and find it without any difficulty once we drove there.
I love the blackout curtains that allow for my kids to sleep but also move easily and allow you to see the beautiful sunrise over the fields. We also thought it was fun to park on the scale and see how much all our cargo weighed!
They provided a pack n play with a sheet when requested and we all slept like rocks in the beautiful silence. Beautiful and friendly dogs. My 3 year old is usually terrified of dogs but enjoyed petting their dogs.
Good spot to spend the night. Thanks!"

There was no rocker. Ryan was very responsive and easy to deal with. Thank you Ryan! The outside light was burned out which was a negative as we arrived late and could see nothing. It was quiet and private. Over all it’s worth the money if you don’t mind making do with whatever doesn’t work or is missing.

Stayed with a pet","Our Airbnb was amazing for me in a way that had nothing to do with the actual accommodations, but the landscape. Being from eastern Kansas I always get a little miffed/defensive when people dismissively talk about Kansas being flat. I’m so quick to assure them it’s not all flat, like that’s a bad thing. This place was FLAT and gorgeous! There had been a lot of rain and a storm the night we were there, so as we left it was a 360 degree green earth against a perfectly even blue sky. Of course puffy clouds everywhere. Over the rainbow country! Flat and fabulous!
Accommodations were nicely country! If you’re not into a country stay, don’t stay here. It will be wasted on you. There is a mile of dirt road so be aware of weather. There was a lot of rain around time we went so quite muddy. Don’t go for the wifi, it’s spotty. Take a break and disconnect. I’m sending my family who travel between Albuquerque and eastern Kansas to stay here."

Cute little guesthouse has all the necessities and farmhouse-chic decor. The kids were thrilled to find coloring books and crayons in their room. The main bedroom's bed is huge and luxuriously soft - best sleep of the whole cross country road trip - and it was great that the kids could have separate beds in their room. In the morning we met chickens, ducks, horses (one very big, one very small), and one barn cat before heading out. As someone who grew up in the country but has lived in cities the last decade plus, the highlight was definitely that night sky! Absolutely breathtaking!!"

Because it is in a farm setting, we were grateful to be away from the usual city noise and to be able to land in a safe and calm place after being on the road for so long. Many thanks!"

We had some difficulty finding the location because we arrived later in the night but the host was kind enough to rescue us when we were aimlessly driving around 😂 There were the most adorable dogs on the premises we had the pleasure of giving many belly rubs to and the Airbnb space was adorable, comfy, and well equipped! We were in and out pretty quick due to our travel itinerary but I’m confident that this is a lovely, relaxing place to stay for a small vacation. I would also like to mention that the host was very kind and one of the most responsive Airbnb hosts I’ve had."

Make sure you clarify directions because GPS might not work. The only downside was a large barking white poodle that I wasn't sure was friendly or not. They called her in when I requested and that was appreciated. A nice place to stay and get away, especially for road trips!"

Group trip","A relaxing, quiet, and comfortable stay! The listing description perfectly lays out what to expect and it is important to follow the host’s directions in because Waze and Google maps will take you along dirt roads for a whole lot longer than you’ll want. Master bed was oh so comfortable. I slept so peacefully! Pet friendly with approval and an additional fee. My kids enjoyed watching the chickens and ducks, petting the friendly resident turkey, and playing fetch with farm dogs. We were in town to visit family, but were able to make our stay into a relaxing mini-vacation. House is clean and cozy with plenty of linens and appointments to keep my family of 5 comfortable for three nights. Ryan is very prompt with communications and extremely helpful as any issues arise. If we are ever back in the area, this is where we will be staying."

Everything was great except there was absolutely no hot water and there were bugs everywhere. While it’s expected to have to deal with a few bugs while at a farm, it was much worse than expected. The bathroom floor/shower mat was covered in small bugs that crawl all over your feet and there were a few pretty big wolf spiders that were definitely not afraid of humans."

Stayed with kids","This place was excellent value - it comfortably slept our family of four without feeling like we were on top of each other, and the separate rooms were a welcome change from the four of us all in a shared space for the preceding 6 nights we'd spent on our road trip / vacation. The king-sized bed was exceptionally comfortable and I my only regret was that I had to get out of it in the morning. The kids enjoyed the bunk beds, too. We didn't prepare any extravagant meals while there, but it appeared to have everything one would need for making breakfast, lunch & dinner. The linens provided for bed & bath were also more than adequate for us, and it was nice not having to unpack that which we'd brought with us just for a night.
Overall, definitely recommend a stay here if you happen to be in the area. We were on a trip back home from a couple states west of KS but wanted a change of pace from the same trip out we'd made along I-70. It's 15 minutes (or less) from US-56, 83 & 160, so close enough to any highways you might be traveling, but far enough out that you don't have nosy neighbors. Just a word of warning if you book this place - heed the owner's advice about directions when he sends them to you, since Google seems to have made a mess of how the streets in the area are labeled."

The location is typical of Great Plains lands, with fresh air and sweeping ground level views. The animals are a nice touch. The “amenities” are the authenticity. Animals, farmland, a good and safe place to stay. Rustic and small but country living is real. We were a family of four, with school age kids and a dog. Comfortable, plenty of food in Sublette (15-20 minutes). What a beautiful piece of the earth."

We really enjoyed driving out into the rural Kansas farmland and arriving at his beautiful farm! We were greeted by his sweet friendly dogs and easily found access to the lovely apartment that is separate from the main house. The place was charming and full of lots of nice country style touches -- including farm fresh eggs in the frig! The kitchen was all set up to cook with dishes utensils and cookware -- we enjoyed making our home cooked meal upon arrival! It was a very quiet cozy and restful stay -- We would definitely like to return sometime!

Stayed one night","C.J. was an extraordinary host. We stayed for a short night just to sleep and were getting in pretty late. He stayed up to ensure we were able to find our way to the cabin. Extremely responsive in the chat as well.
The cabin itself is larger and cuter in person than the photos let on. Everything was very clean and the place smelled fresh and clean. I wish we had more time there, we woke up at sunrise snd enjoyed the fresh air and bird songs. Quite an amazing little place they have.
Absolutely follow his written instructions to find the place, do not use your phone map. If you use his directions it will be no problem. Will definitely recommend to friends and we would love to stay again.
We loved reading his bio as well, you can tell him and his wife are very passionate about their little piece of heaven, as they should be.
Thanks again!"

While you're there kick back on the porch with a book in the evening, then watching the sunrise in the morning — that's the life! Due to its remoteness, the cabin may not be suitable for working remotely, but it's great for a digital detox or to break up the drive between Kansas City and Santa Fe, as I did. Just be sure to use C.J.'s excellent directions; don't rely on your phone's maps!"

When I needed a crockpot, C.J. brought one over for me. And since I was an extended stay, they put up a Mail box for my cabin which was super nice of them. The horse Grey loved the apples I would give them. The farm cats were cute too. Laundry was in the other cabin but still super close and everything I needed was provided. Wifi was a little slow/far away but still worked for schoolwork (with patience). The land around was gorgeous and you can often see deer, pheasants, coyotes, etc.
the stars in the night were the brightest I’ve ever seen since there was no light pollution. Overall 9.5/10 stars 😀"

Stayed one night","C.J.'s place is truly a gem in the rough! WOW! I cannot wait to go back. The peacefulness and serenity of Kismet, KS is something I have experienced very few times in my life. If you watch sunrise you will want to stay for much longer then one night and also listen to the serenity of NO NOISE around you at all when you walk or sit on the beautiful cabin porch. Highly recommend relaxing in the cozy space with the book Hillbilly Elegy by J.D. Vance, available to read in the cabin. It is incredible! The town of Liberal is fun to explore and the plane museum as well as my favorite stop was New Beginnings Church in Liberal. Very welcoming and an amazing word of God! I ate at Brick House in Liberal and also C.J. was very kind and graciously gave me a tour of the farm (meeting his horse Grey was epic and wonderful- what a beauty! C.J. is very kind, helpful, accommodating, responds quickly for anything you need, and will help make sure you get right to the cabin safely. His character is resounding and he has the best stories. What he has built at the farm is beauty and harmony. Enjoy your stay and the simplicity of how life can always be if we allow for it! Thank you for a great stay C.J."

Group trip","My family enjoyed the house , great house and very homie, way better thank a 5 star hotel. Everything in the home was up to par, the layout of the house was awsome. We actually got together as a family in the dinning room for Thanksgiving and also i n the inclosed back porch we ust relax and talk about get together until 2 am, very quiet neighborhood , we actually got caught in the snow storm and it was time for the kids and adults to go outside for a little fun. If we would travel agian to leberal kansas, we all decided that we woild stay again at the Ozome house agian . Thank you to the Ozome house family and see you in the future for another stay!!!!😊😊"

Group trip","My recent stay at the Ozsome house was nothing short of magical! From the moment I stepped through the door, I was swept away by the charm, comfort, and attention to detail that made this Airbnb experience truly exceptional.First and foremost, the communication with the host was outstanding. They were prompt, friendly, and went above and beyond to ensure a seamless check-in process. The warm welcome continued as I entered the space, finding it meticulously clean and beautifully decorated. The photos online don't do justice to the cozy ambiance and tasteful design that permeates every corner of this home.The attention to detail is what sets this Airbnb apart from the rest. From the well-curated selection of snacks and thoughtful decor to the fully equipped kitchen stocked with essentials, every element is carefully chosen to enhance the guest experience. It's clear that the host has put a lot of thought into creating a space that feels like a home away from home. Highly recommended!"
