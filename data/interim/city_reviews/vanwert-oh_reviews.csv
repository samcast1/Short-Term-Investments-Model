Group trip","We were in Van Wert for the eclipse. Jennifer proactively provided eclipse glasses. From the Farmhouse it is an easy walk to down town where there are several coffee shops and bakeries, and to a park where we saw totality!
The Farmhouse was very clean and we enjoyed the country decor. We really appreciated a supply of common kitchen spices and other kitchen basics. Good pots, pans, bowls, etc.
We definitely would stay here again."

Stayed with kids","I wish all Airbnb stays were as great as this one! We stopped on our way through with several of our children and 5 grandchildren ages 0-5.
Parking was fine for 3 vehicles, with one in the garage.
We all enjoyed the Shel Silverstein books from the library, and the children loved the playroom toys. Plenty of room for 11 people.
The kitchen was clean and well stocked. There were lots of clean towels - we only used a fraction of the supply.
The decor was tasteful and comfortable - not as bare bones as you see sometimes. The house is old but feels well maintained.
I wholeheartedly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights",Was the perfect setup for my coworkers and I to share while in town for a project. Working all over the country we usually split hotel rooms and that can be pricy and cramped at times. This home had a separate bedroom for each of us and plenty of room in common areas to make us feel at home. Plenty of nearby food and shopping options. Two thumbs up from all four of us on the accommodations.

Our family of 9 fit easily, with room to spare- and we were even surprised after day 1 to find the finished basement!
Everything was clean and organized and felt like home. The home already met all expectations, but the little touches like coffee and keurig containers, laundry soap, and shampoo/conditioner/body wash made available put it over the top.
We really enjoyed our stay and absolutely loved the beauty of the home. Definitely recommend staying here."

Having 2.5 bathrooms was fabulous. All the little extra that were available were a plus. (bottled water, snacks by the front door, coffee, hot tea, shampoo, bodywash, plus more). We were intown for The World 100 in Rossburg at Eldora Speedway. We will definitely stay again. Hopefully, we could make it a yearly trip with all of our friends who loved the place also."

Stayed with kids",Our stay at the Farmhouse was so wonderful! This house is huge and stocked with pretty much everything you need. The 3 (!) bathrooms were spotless. The bedrooms were spacious and comfortable. I also couldn't believe how quiet the neighborhood was. Never once was I woken by traffic or people during our weekend stay. I slept so soundly. Jennifer was also very responsive through text. We really enjoyed our stay. My only complaint (and that of the other adult guests staying with us agreed) that the main floor of the house was very grimy. It was sticky and all of our socks had black stains on them from it. Not necessarily something I want to let my one year old walk/crawl around on. If there had been a steam mop at the place I would have cleaned it myself. Other than that there was nothing else wrong with our stay. We may very likely return again in the future!

Stayed with kids","What a find! Things we loved: Walkable to the cute downtown (go see Expressions coffee shop. Coffee-snob worthy Italian beans per my Chicago/17year old/barista kid, beautiful breakfasts!)
This was perhaps the best-appointed airBNB we've ever visited. And it was immaculately clean. I think it's actually better in real life than the photos.
Some things that were life-savers: emergency monthly female supplies (13 year old was so thankful!), and snacks to hold over the 5 year old nephew from a meltdown. This is a well-laid out floor plan. Lots of getaway spaces, fun and quirky play room for the little kids, loved having box fans in each room. Seriously- every detail was attended to. Covered back porch was a beautiful spot for morning tea.
2 block walk to downtown, antique shop, a cute park with a gazebo was a nice meditation spot. It's a pretty picturesque midwestern small downtown. We'll for sure be back!"

Air hockey, fooseball, board games, and books for all ages are available for fun. The beds were soft and comfy, and the sheets and blankets clean and fresh. From snacks to water bottles, fluffy towels to shampoo, conditioner and body wash, Jenniffer thought of everything to make a stay at the Farmhouse on Wall easy to relax and enjoy. Our family was totally blessed to come here together from Texas, Ohio, and Pennsylvania for a wedding. We all enjoyed our stay immensely! We agreed that we would love to bring the family together for another stay here."

Stayed with kids",We came in to visit family and friends. I was worried at 1st because I had never rented an Airbnb before. It was easy to do. Jenniffer was very responsive and answered any questions I had. The house was beautiful. It had plenty of room for my family of 5. My 2 year old loved the kids play room upstairs. We had everything we needed. It is in waking distance of the historic library. And the town center. And close to stores. There is a full size bathroom with walk in shower down stairs. Which was so Helpful for my mother in law. She had trouble getting upstairs. The couch pulled out into a sleeper sofa. My mother in law finally decided to go with us. After I already booked the house. But It was easy to contact Jenniffer and get her added to her number of guests. The only issues we really had was my husband and mother could not get back in from the front porch after setting out and drinking coffee. The entry code did not work for that door. My husband had to walk around to get back in.

The beds were comfortable with plenty of blankets, pillows and linens. She even had a fan which I always sleep with but would not have thought to bring! The amenities were plentiful and much more than other places I’ve stayed in the past. I highly recommend this beautiful home if you wanted a relaxing place to stay. Plenty room for kids of all ages and even pets! (We have adult kiddos but toddlers on up would enjoy this place. ) Thank You for a great, stress free stay!"

Stayed a few nights","The ""farmhouse on Wall"" was a perfect location for our friends' board game weekend. We chose it for its central location from our homes in Chicago, Michigan, and Columbus. The house is very charming with a great kitchen, multiple rooms for hanging out (we especially loved the back room in the morning for its natural sunlight), and four large bedrooms with very comfortable beds. We had a nice afternoon walk to downtown Van Wert. There was a cool historic library, a few interesting antique shops, and we found a classic diner for lunch. I definitely recommend the house for any group looking for a relaxing getaway in a well-stocked & comfortable house in this area of Ohio."

Stayed with kids","This is a great place to stay for families with children or multiple families! Large, spacious, and well furnished. Our children loved all the games and didn’t want to leave. Unfortunately in their play they knocked over a desk lamp and broke the shade. Jenniffer found a replacement for a very reasonable price and we were happy to reimburse her for that.
There is parking space for 2 vehicles in the garage and street parking which might be crowded, but we found it adequate.
You will not be disappointed with this house. It is pet friendly, but even so we found no “evidence” of former pets staying there, for which we were relieved!"

Stayed with a pet","The farmhouse is beautiful, spacious and dog friendly which was nice. There is a little back yard and not much room to let animals out, parking is limited.
A few issues we had with this property is the beds have a memory foam topper which makes it difficult to sleep when you’re hot and melted into the fabric.
Another issue we had is this property as you walk in is so perfumey you feel like you’re at a bath and body works. The bedding was heavily washed in beads/ detergent which made it hard to sleep- one of our guest ended up sleeping on the couch because of it. The towels also were strongly perfumy. We are not a sensitive smelling family but this was rough. Ended up checking out a day early because of it and no response from host regarding concerns. We will not book this home again."

This house was the perfect place for the 7 of us to meet! The house itself was beautiful. It was nicely and comfortably furnished, with every amenity I could think to ask for. The little touches including a welcome basket with snacks, coffee and creamer for the K-cup machine, and even a dog bed, food and water bowls, and dog treats, were extremely appreciated!!!
We had no issues causing us to contact Jenniffer, but the minimum communication required for the booking was polite, timely, and made things easy as pie. So thank you Jenniffer for a wonderful stay! We hope to come back again!"

There was a dog bed which was very welcoming to my dogs and it was nice knowing that they understand fur babies are part of your family and they truly made it comfortable for us all. I think anyone would be very pleased to stay here. It really was a gem!

The pictures do not do this place justice. There is plenty of room for large families and so many thoughtful touches for all guests. (Extra pillows, blankets, games, baby high chair, pack n play a little toy room, and so much more). There are two beautiful patios to enjoy a cup of joe from the adorable coffee bar. There is garage parking. I could go on and on. We have family in Van Wert and will definitely be back to stay at the farmhouse."

Thankfully, this beautiful and well appointed home was available, and was able to save the day for us! This home has a wonderfully stocked kitchen, an amazing washer and dryer and plenty of comfortable beds for your loved ones. Wifi is fast and reliable, the TV is easy to use and the heat works! We stayed in this home during one of the coldest times this year and were nothing but comfortable.
I am deeply appreciative for this home and this host. Thank you for making our Christmas enjoyable and not miserable experience."

At first I thought I would be interrupting and disturbing the hosts by having company or coming and going at all hours of the day and night but they assured me that it was not a bother at all and to feel free to proceed with my plans as planned. They were accommodating and were always making sure I was comfortable. A couple days got chilly and they brought me an extra heater even. I highly recommend this place. 10/10"

Stayed with kids","This was a perfect place to stay with our young children overnight on our way to a wedding. The space was small but well laid out with everything we needed as well as a few activities for the children. All of the beds are upstairs and the bathroom is downstairs. The kitchen was well stocked for us to do our own cooking. We loved the peaceful country setting that made us feel more at home. The backyard was great for the children to play with the playsets and green space. It would have been fun to swim/kayak/play in the sand if it were summer. The trampoline was not assembled as pictured but maybe that is a seasonal thing as we arrived in November.
The place was clean, tastefully decorated and well thought out. Marci was a great communicator and a wonderful hostess. Would recommend!"

Was a great clean and safe place as home base for the activities I needed to accomplish while in town. The host was very responsive and helpful. In case it matters, know that the beds are all upstairs and the only bathroom is downstairs. Also, for tall folk like me, the upstairs slanted ceiling was low even at the highest point and much lower at the head of the bed. It only took me about three “head bangs” to finally figure that part out. :)"

But other than a half second of confusion when we first arrived, everything was great! the listing undersells the back yard. our two year old had a great time playing on their little beach, and jumping on the trampoline."

Stayed a few nights","Family with 3 kids from Germany, came to the area for a weekend to visit friends. Maci's place was perfectly located for our purposes, right between Bluffton (Walmart at approx. 8 minutes) and Ossian (don't miss Heyerley's bakery for the best donuts). We had a great stay for 3 nights. Our girls had a lot of fun on the property, with the family cat, the swimming pond and the swings. oh and the lightning bugs swarming the fields at dusk are another highlight. Marci is a real awesome host, very caring and accommodating, even helped us out greatly by taking care of our laundry, which was perfect for a fresh takeoff into our further vacation. Also enjoyed the forest neighboring the property, which belongs to the nearby High School is open to public use and features well maintained cross trails. We'll definitely recommend this nice place and come back if we get the chance some day."

She also reached out a few times during our stay, just to check on us. The back yard space was great! My little one loved the ""beach"". Even though the place was only separated by the garage, we hardly heard anything on our side, just car doors occasionally. Definitely recommend 😀"

Stayed one night","Such a cute little home. It’s like a guest house located next to their actual house, but it’s a completely separate building. Very clean and spacious, I guess the only thing is the bedrooms are upstairs and the bathroom is downstairs so it’s a whole journey if you need to go in the middle of the night. The backyard is lovely, they have a cute pond and I spent my morning watching crayfish and herrings while sitting on the small boardwalk they have. They are quick to respond when I had questions, and if I’m ever traveling through again I’ll be sure to stay!"

We went to the recommended Mexican restaurant for dinner then came back to sit on the deck by the pond. We may have dipped our toes in that warm water for a minute or two before heading back inside. We propped our feet up on the soft reclining couch and watched a movie before heading upstairs to bed. We've been coming through here pretty often over the last several months and without a doubt we'll stay here again! Thank you, Marci and family!!!"

The guest apartment was very clean and just as pictured. I am very sensitive to smells, and there is a room fragrance and old smoke smell that I could smell, but my partner couldn't. It triggers my allergies, but other than that, it was a wonderful stay and so quiet and peaceful! Marci was a great communicator before the trip as well. If it weren't for my allergies, I would happily stay again."

Stayed with kids","This two story apartment was designed and is maintained with love. Spotless and cozy, the comfortable furniture and warm decor made me wonder if the space was originally meant for the host's grown children or parents. In any case, it was perfect for our family's visit to relatives over Christmas.
Marci was an extremely warm and gracious host, pro-actively messaging us several times during our week-long stay to check in. She volunteered to provide a pack-n-play without my asking and also (twice!) to wash a load of laundry for us during our week-long stay.
One small inconvenience to note - there is no bathroom on the second floor, where the bedroom and bed nook are located. However, there is a nice light dimmer switch for the stairs, so you can safely descend at night without being blinded."

Stayed with kids","Very quite home that gave us a place to rest and recover after visiting family.
We were disappointed to find that though it can sleep 4, it only had eating space for 2 at a time. Also, wish there would have been a coffee table of sorts that we could have set up board games on as it is a family pass time. There was ample floor space to play, but due to physical limitations I couldn’t sit on the floor long enough to play a game with my husband and son.
The hosts were very quick to respond and very accommodating when requests were made. We will most likely be staying here again next time we are in town."

Group trip","We were glad to find a place to stay in an area with very few lodging options. Our group of five used all the beds and the sofa. We found this house to be clean and comfortable. It was warm during our stay and the A/C worked well. We had all five of our group on the internet at times and found it plenty fast enough. We didn't really use the kitchen much, but it had what we needed. About the only negative is that the kitchen is carpeted and the carpet is damaged and worn out. Jack told me he plans to replace flooring when the season slows down. We did manage to fit a pickup truck towing an 8 ft U-Haul trailer and a compact SUV all in the driveway in case that applies to anyone else. We would return here should the need arise again."

Stayed a few nights","The Cherub Chalet was very nice. It was easy to find and is located very close to a McDonald’s, a Cicle K (open 24 hours) and a Rite Aid. All are within a very short walk, in good weather. Check-in was the easiest of any stay we’ve ever had.
The fridge is full size and the kitchen is well stocked with equipment i.e. plates, bowls, silverware, coffee cups, pots, pans, measuring cup, mixing bowls and baking dishes, including a glass bread loaf pan as well as a glass 8”x 8” & glass 13” x 9” pan. The oven is a smaller width, but has full-size depth and worked great baking brownies in the 13x9 pan.
It was cold when we stayed, but the heat worked great.
My family and I would highly recommend a stay here!"

The home was quiet and worked for our one-night stay before heading home after a family reunion. The queen bed was very comfortable, and the smart tv was nice for lots of options. The shower had great water pressure. The home was in a very nice neighborhood, and we felt safe the entire time we were there.
We will remember this place when we make trips to Ohio in the future!"

Group trip","Myself, my boyfriend, our two kids and my mom stayed at Dees place for two nights for a wedding we had in town. Dee was very accommodating! There have been some recent updates to the place including a new heating and cooling system, and modern lighting on the ceiling fans. The location is perfect! It is close by to gas stations, restaurants, and downtown. Everywhere we needed to be was within 10 minutes.
Since it is on a busy street, there is some noise. If you’re a light sleeper I would recommend bringing a fan or something along for some white noise. The water was barely warm. I could hardly withstand the shower because of it. I have reached out to the host with the recommendation of checking out the water heater. Otherwise we had no issues with our stay!"

There aren't many airbnbs in Van Wert, especially that allow dogs. These days all travel arrangements for me are made with my dogs along or I don't travel. Adams place is very peaceful, quiet, not much traffic, beautiful views and just what we love! It's nice and bright inside once you throw open the curtains on the huge windows and the AC worked great! It's quick and easy to change to dark and cool if you're ready to relax for a bit. All of these things made me feel just like I was at home. Oh, and the bed in the master bedroom is to die for comfy!! Can't wait to visit my hometown again now, thanks Adam!!"

Stayed with a pet","It was a pretty good stay. I would recommend providing laundry detergent. Would have been nice to do our laundry with 2 kids and 2 adults before going back home. The shower grossed me out a little , i’m sure it was clean but looks dirty. I would recommend adding lighting around the bathroom sink for the women who do their hair and makeup, it was rlly hard to do my usual routine bc i couldn’t rlly see much. The living room was nice the kitchen was okay. The beds were extremely uncomfortable my back is killing me. Overall could use some updates. Mediocre stay."

Everything was comfy, room for 7 of us and an ideal location for every place we needed to be that day. It was a much better deal that could have been provided by a local hotel, especially for the number of people who came with us for the celebration.
I will definitely book again for my next visit to Decatur. Thank you for a lovely visit."

This is especially helpful when stores are closed and you need a cup of tea or a quick meal. There are toys for the children and games for the family to play. Too bad we didn’t get a chance to use the firepit - maybe on our next visit to Decatur.

Group trip","We travel full time, coast to coast, as touring musicians. Jessica's home in Decatur was one of our top stays. Jessica has created a wonderful respite that was much appreciated by our family (5 adults) while on-the-road between performances. Our time was necessarily brief but this would be a lovely location by those seeking accommodations for longer periods of time. We were able to cook our supper and although the dining area was beautiful and spacious we took our meal outside to the picnic table to enjoy the fresh air and song birds. We took a walk down the country road just as it was getting dark and recharged our spirits with the fireflies twinkling over the prairie grasses. A big storm blew through but we felt safe and comfortable inside and Jessica even messaged us to make sure we were ok and had power - we were!"

Stayed with kids","Where do I begin! This place is like HOME. There were things this home had that I didn't even think about. I traveled with my elderly parents, my brother and my daughter and it was comfortable for us all. After coming from a funeral it was comfortable for us to relax and enjoy ourselves. It was so peaceful and warm during these cold days. There are plenty of blankets to feel nice and cozy and watch the big TV on the couch. I cooked full meals in the well equipped kitchen. My favorite part was the Sega Genesis game console, i felt like a kid again. Me and my 7 year old had some good times playing it our first night. There is literally nothing this home lacked. There were snacks waiting for us when we arrived. Jessica was great with communicating and prompt. This was my parents first experience at an air bnb and they were impressed. I've stayed at several in many different states and i would have to say this is my favorite. Thank you so much Jessica!"

Stayed a few nights","Joy's AIRBNB was lovely and you can tell she takes a lot of pride in what she has accomplished by doing most of the work herself. Exceptionally clean and comfortable. Close to downtown and walkable to many locations.
I did experience problems getting the code to work for opening the property. I spoke to Joy and we made it work once but after that we had to find a work around.
I also had trouble with the TV/Cable. The system was not synced properly and I had to spend about 30-45 minutes with the carrier to get them to work. After that, every time I wanted to watch TV, I had to go through that process again to sync them up. I'm sure that isn't the normal but it worked for me."

It’s small yet it has a surprising amount of culture. We used it to go the Eldora Speedway for a 4 day event, and we all enjoyed it."

The parking behind the house is great, which fits an Expedition and F150 truck. The washer and drier were a plus, and the extra linen was helpful, especially with 7 people."

Stayed a few nights",This is an absolutely lovely place in a great location right on main street in walking distance to the main street ammenities. Yet the area is kind of at the end of main street so it is very quiet and peaceful there. Everything was so clean nice and new! Decorated beautifully. Joy is an excellent host as she came out to help me in the pouring rain when i accidentally locked myself out DUH! but Joy was so nice and came right away! (Note to self is to not lock the front storm door to the porch and leave out the back door locking that too because you wont be able to get to the front door keypad if you do!) lol smh. But she couldn't have been any nicer about it. We really appreciated that. And apparently a spare key to back door was right there on the fridge for our use also but we had not seen it. I guess we were just so discombobulated from a long trip. But anyways I highly recommend this place and Host Joy for a stay and hope that it is available for a booking the next time we come.

The house is impeccably clean, incredibly affordable, extremely comfortable, and downright beautiful. My kids were overjoyed with a home that had toys for them to play with and they loved the oversized bean-bag chair. When it was time to leave my oldest son (4) lamented our departure, “I never want to leave this house!” We look forward to our next stay when we are visiting family in the Van Wert area."

Stayed with kids","From the moment you walk into the breezeway, you will feel at peace. Staying away from home can sometimes be nerve wracking and cause some anxiety for myself, but this home was a home run out of the ballpark! The ease of contactless access and check-out was a blessing for us as some of our family had flight delays and others came early. It was so nice to see the little details throughout the home—like popcorn, travel sizes of shampoo and body wash, even some tide pods so we took home no dirty clothing. The linens throughout the home were wonderful, soft, and plentiful for our family or 8 guests and one baby. I cannot put into words what the shower feels like. It was like a spa experience and so talked of how wonderful it was. The water had our hair feeling so soft and it wasn’t your average hotel shower that doesn’t have any pressure to it. The checkout list was also helpful for the kids to see and know what was expected before leaving. The kids enjoyed watching movies and playing with toys in the upstairs 3rd bedroom/living room, which allowed the adults to enjoy some football without the kids being bored. This home had a fantastic table for all of us to enjoy meals together as we had family from several different states together. The home has a very warm feel and we would recommend to anyone looking to stay in the area or if you are just passing through! The price of a hotel was more for the area we were looking and Joy’s home allowed for us to all be together, wash our clothing, and cook meals together for an even better price.
Thank you Joy for allowing our family to enjoy some very special moments together after such a hard time with the pandemic. We look forward to having more guests stay here in the future!"

The price was very reasonable for a room with a private bathroom and access to the kitchen, living room, and porch with chairs/table. Don communicated effectively and informed us of the code, how to check in, where to park, etc. Coffee, tea, and water were provided, and there was much room to store food in the refrigerator/freezer. The rooms were painted and decorated with professional care, and we enjoyed the two pieces of candy left on the bed tray. If you have time, you should take a self-guided tour of the historic homes nearby, too!"

Check-in, parking & check-out instructions were crystal clear. It’s obvious Don is a seasoned traveler as his attention to detail ensures a comfortable stay for all guests. He & his on-site staff have carefully thought of “extra touch” amenities that just make your stay more pleasurable whether it’s complimentary coffee, tea, local restaurant menus, bedside tissues or extra blankets. The entire home is tastefully decorated, spacious but not overdone with unnecessary “fluff.” I cook while traveling as my husband & I nourish with only fresh food. The kitchen was fully stocked, & appliances, sink, dishes & utensils were spotlessly cleaned. We live in a 200 yr+ gothic revival & felt right at home in the Victorian guesthouse. Our stay was perfect. Thanks, Don!"

It was nice that my family coming in from different area where all able to stay in the same place, have our own private space and beautiful common areas to connect. I would highly recommend staying here. It’s close and walkable to all the bars and eateries. And a block away from St John’s church if you are in town for a wedding. Don and his team are very responsive and kind. Old school bed and breakfast vibe with the modern air bnb spin. I will def stay again."

Stayed one night","Don was extremely responsive and couldn’t have been easier to work with. The property was absolutely gorgeous. I highly recommend the room we stayed in - Room #4. Don supplied everything you’d hope for, from cushy towels and excellent pillows to lovely extra touches like a welcome station in the communal dining area with bottles water, snacks and self serve coffee, easy to find extra blankets and even little extras like chocolates in the room. I also love that in his welcome email with building and room entry codes he explained everything in detail. Even though Don was very quick to reply to texts, we only had to look to the email to find the answer to all of our questions (where to park, wifi password, check in and check out time, where to find things we needed, etc.). I would definitely stay at the Victorian Guesthouse again. Even if you live in or near Delphos and just want to have a lovely staycation, we say check it out! Thank you Don!"

Stayed with kids","Beautiful vintage home! Quiet and peaceful. I was traveling with my sisters to visit our great aunt who was turning 95. She was in Piqua, Ohio. We chose this location for several reasons 1) it was only an hour away from Piqua. 2) the space was absolutely perfect for a large group. House was as pictured and described. 3) we love historic homes (the woodwork was so well preserved! The porch was inviting with plenty of room to relax). 4) the outdoor space had a lovely farmyard feel: oaks, fruit trees, huge barn, and well kept flowers/plants. We felt at home instantly. 5) very reasonable price! It was, by far, the perfect place for us. We enjoyed the ample sitting arrangement in both the living and dining rooms- we could just relax and chat, play games, and eat the meals prepared in the kitchen. I slept very well, the beds were so comfortable. Plenty of space for all of us! Bonnie was very attentive and made us feel welcomed to her beautiful home! I highly recommend Five Oaks!"

Stayed a few nights","I am a frequent visitor to the Van Wert area to visit my family after moving out of state almost two years ago. After trying many of the local hotels, I became disappointed paying the price for dirty rooms and showers with no pressure or slow draining. So I decided to look into what else was available. We were pleasantly surprised to find Emma’s place through here. Her place is beautiful, modern, cozy, and equipped with everything you would need during your stay. There is some noise being that it is on a busy street, but we listen to a noisemaker at night, so that wasn’t really an issue. We are used to a king size bed, so the queen was an adjustable for us, but comfortable enough for a couple nights. I actually loved the feel of the sheets and blanket that were on the bed. I looked at the tags and am planning to purchase for my own home. This will definitely be my go to place if available on my trips back to Ohio."

Stayed a few nights","This place is a gem! Such a cute and clean little cottage. It’s a perfect place to stay while visiting the Decatur area. It’s located in a delightful neighborhood and very walkable to downtown and local restaurants etc. We were in town for a birthday/family reunion and found this house to be perfect for our family. So many extras - the fridge was stocked with milk, OJ, wine and cheese & salami snacks. Also in the kitchen was a delicious breakfast brioche along with fruit and cereals. What a welcome addition to our stay. Also there were tons of extra towels and linens which were very much appreciated. The house was spotless with cute homey decorations. Will definitely stay here again when visiting. Kelly goes above and beyond to make sure your stay is perfect!"

Stayed with kids","This is such a fantastic little b&b, and I can't say enough nice things about the host! My daughter forgot her iPad, and Kelly was so helpful in getting it back to us.
This place has more thoughtful amenities than you'll find at the most upscale hotel, at a price that compares to moderate/budget hotels. If you're staying in Decatur, it's really a no-brainer to stay here. It was really nice being able to give my daughter her own room during our stay, and having kitchen access while traveling is a must for us too. The snacks and cold waters we found upon our late night arrival were beyond appreciated after a day of travel, and having the spare basket of toiletries and night light available were nice perks. We also appreciated the soft towels/white linens, candles, and disposable plates/flatware for convenience. The muffins were delicious.
The location is easy to get to, and it was nice to have an off street parking spot. Located within a few minutes' drive of several restaurants, ice cream, etc.
Cleanliness was a 10/10, and I can't think of a single negative thing to say other than that the master bed was on the firm side, which some people might prefer. (the couch and twin beds are softer, so you've got options if you stay here.)
My daughter enjoyed the games and especially the coloring book provided, and said her bed felt cozy .
The decor was on point, and we enjoyed the bee theme in the kitchen and throughout the house. We could tell that a lot of effort was put into modern updates with a cohesive design.
Thank you for your attention to detail that made our stay next level. we hope to stay here the next time we're in Decatur!"

Fully stocked kitchen with plates, cups, utensils. Coffee for guests which was nice. My only complaints would be the curtains were sheer and it was a tad bit cold. Perhaps a space heater or some extra blankets would be great! Still deserves 5 stars in my book. Host was great too. Super responsive. Thanks!"

I literally have traveled the world for the last 15 years of my professional career and been blessed to have many wonderful experiences,.

Conveniently located for walking to coffee, restaurants, etc. Would be awesome if there were a bigger bed or additional sleeping space in living area if more than 1 guest.

Sticky is a first class host, I'm sure he would have additional recommendations."

Stayed one night","This place is very cool. (I know that's an old term, but this loft is very well done). Modern design, with everything you need for a comfortable stay. Well appointed kitchen, large bathroom with walk-in shower, comfortable living space with a large tv. Great location right downtown so you can walk to a lot of places. The only caution I'd mention is the twenty-one steps to get up to the unit. As I said, we're old and decided to leave our large bags in the car rather than schlepping them up those steps. Also, the bed is a full, not a queen or a king. We were cozy, but just so you know. Otherwise, we thougholy enjoyed our stay."

The kitchen is well stocked with any cooking utensils you should need and the full size refrigerator was a a bonus! The host had wonderful communication and assisted with any questions I had.

There was also a big playground set and trampoline that the kids loved!! We would love to come back in the near future!! Lexy and her family were very kind and welcoming.

We loved the ping pong table, and my son liked being able to play with toys that are available in the family room. Overall a great stay."

Stayed with kids","This property is gorgeous inside and out. We were free to use the pool and play in the yard whenever we wanted. The basement apartment and being outside felt private despite the owners being there. There weren’t any other people in sight! My phone had no reception in the apartment and the WiFi didn’t work well. It was surprising because I never go anywhere with spotty internet connection, but ended up being ok because it forced me off my phone, left me without Netflix, and untemped to throw the kids in front of the tv instead of playing and dancing with them. I would def stay again! If there were a hot tub outdoors, I’d book a few nights this winter to take in the gorgeous sunsets to the west which will be even more delightful once the trees are bare. Thanks for being great hosts!"

The internet and cell phone coverage is spotty but I was still able to work with a few internet service interruptions while I was there.
I will say that if you're looking for quiet solitude, this isn't the place for you as there are small children on the premises that do what small children do. Otherwise if that doesn't bother you, I would highly recommend staying here."

We had our one year old with us, and they had everything for her as well - pack n play, high chair, toys - we didn't have to bring a thing. The pool was gorgeous and well maintained, it was so nice to lounge in the pool all day. The wifi/cell service can be spotty, so it may be hard if you need to do something with internet service. However, it was nice to be a bit more disconnected. Would definitely recommend a stay!"
