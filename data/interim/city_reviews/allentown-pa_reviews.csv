Stayed a few nights","Ashley's home is truly stunning - the photos in no way do it justice. The house is large and ultra-modern, filled with light and art and thoughtful design touches. The open plan downstairs is perfect for a (very) large family or group of friends to spend quality time together. There are four separate (but connected) seating areas, not counting those outside in the gorgeous backyard. Both the house and the area are serene, and it's lovely to be able to walk to the Rose Garden or Trexler right from the front door. Ashley's home is packed with every appliance you might need - from a Kitchen Aid mixer to a built in surround sound system. It feels like a real home away from home. Ashley was nothing but generous and responsive to us, and we couldn't have asked for more. If you need time in the Lehigh Valley, this home is our unreserved recommendation - you won't be disappointed."

Stayed a few nights","Ashley’s house is one of a kind! Large and inviting, with tons of original art and a sharp eye for design, this was a pristine, beautifully laid out house for a weekend stay in Allentown! My family spread out comfortably. The kitchen was extremely well equipped for cooking in, but several good restaurants were right nearby, and Ashley was kind enough to include additional recommendations in the welcome book. We took one of those suggestions and had a superb meal at Bolete - thank you for the tip! The house is incredibly close to the Muhlenberg campus if that’s the reason you’re in town, and a short drive to everything else."

Her beautiful home was exactly what we hoped it would be. It was the perfect size for our family. It's proximity to Allentown's green space, walking paths, and rose garden were great. Ashley was also extremely responsive to my questions (Yes, there is a Nespresso machine - with a complimentary sleeve of coffee capsules. Yes, it is an original size machine).

The kitchen is a joy to cook in with everything you could ever need, including seasonings, condiments, cookware and appliances. The beds are comfortably firm, which is a welcome change from many airbnbs. We enjoyed every part of the house, including the lush backyard, visiting with friends in the living room and kitchen and playing ping-pong in the garage. Ashley was very responsive and accommodating. We didn’t want to leave and we hope we can stay again next year when we’re in town."

Stayed with kids","Ashley's place was simply amazing. We were in town to celebrate Thanksgiving with my sister and I was easily able to prepare a meal in her kitchen to take to my sister's. Everything we needed was there from cookware & dishes to spices. The double oven came in handy as well. The home itself was gorgeous, well appointed and modern with luxurious finishes and beautiful artwork. Even with that, it still felt homely and our three kids (9,12 & 14) all felt comfortable. Would definitely recommend her place for a quick getaway with family or even a girls weekend with friends. You won't regret it.
As a host, Ashley was friendly and very responsive."

Group trip","This is one of the best AirBnB experiences I've had. Lauryn's house is amazing: clean, cozy, and comfortable. You'll feel like you've arrived home as soon as you walk through the door. We slept like babies on the big king mattress in the master bedroom, and made food in the spacious modern kitchen. We did long walks around the quiet neighborhood and the adjacent golf course in this rural-ish setting near a Whole Foods store.
Lauryn herself is a fantastic host who has constructed a great place to stay. But her real superpower is her attention to detail (everything is taken care of) and her friendly, helpful demeanor. Any questions I had were answered immediately, and general communication and instructions were flawless.
There's no higher praise I can give this experience!"

Stayed a few nights","I have stayed at a lot of AirBnB properties and Lauryn’s by far has been my best experience. The house was extremely clean, well maintained, and very inviting. I was amazed how clean this house was. I called my wife after the first night and told her the bed sheets smelled like home; I was truly amazed.
The kitchen had everything you could want or need. Lauryn had plenty of coffee, she even had to go cups, which was helpful when leaving at 7 am for a training class. The living room furniture was very comfortable, not to mention, the beds were outstanding to sleep on.
If you find yourself needing a place to stay in Eastern PA, you must book Lauryn’s house. I would stay here anytime I’m in the area.
Lauryn - well done, you are an outstanding host and keep an extremely clean house. Thank you for the welcome letter, free coffee and waters in the fridge.

We enjoyed the open kitchen and comfortable large living room , sleep was amazing, beds were comfortable, temperature was ideal and there were blankets and extra towels, linens available if needed. This sunny location is perfect to enjoy a quiet morning watching birds and wildlife in yard, and a nice cup of coffee from the coffee bar. The host is so thoughtful, so many nice , welcoming touches and communicative. Relaxing, close to many restaurants,, grocery stores, and shopping was idea to get a few things we needed. We enjoyed our visit so much, it was hard to leave. We consider this location to be an excellent value and very nice experience. Would return anytime we need to visit family in the area."

Stayed with kids",Was staying in the area for my sons surgery at the nearby hospital. SOO GLAD we chose this place! Literally the nicest Air BNB I have ever stayed in. Lauryn is probably the most thoughtful kind-hearted person. What a wonderful host she has everything you might need while staying. Say you might have forgotten anything at home? Don't worry she will make sure that you have it. Such a beautiful home! Beds were VERY comfortable. We did not want to leave! A plus for any families wanting to stay - she has an alert ring system for when the outside doors open and close! We felt super safe with my special needs son. Will definitely be staying here again if we ever need to come back to the hospital again.

It couldn't have been any cleaner and well-maintained. Communication was extremely good, while maintaining privacy and it was clear that Helen was just a text away.
The location has lots of quality eating and some shopping nearby as well as a quaint tavern just across the main road. Near to all major routes to most anywhere in the area. Hoping to stay again!"

Stayed over a week","My stay with Lauryn was absolutely perfect! Lauryn is very responsive and kind, always happy to help or answer questions. The house was beautiful and exactly as shown in the photos. The space was clean and inviting when I arrived, and check in was very straightforward. The bedrooms were spacious, comfortable, and stocked with lots of pillows and linens. I was so impressed to find a closet full of toiletry items easily forgotten when traveling. I was there for an entire month, and it snowed a couple of times; Lauryn and her family came to shovel and salt the sidewalk and parking spaces while I was at work completely unprompted to make it easy for me to get in and out of the house. She also organized for a neighbor to help take trash and recycling to the curb on trash days so I didn’t have to worry about it. Check out was just as easy as check in. Lauryn was a wonderful host, and I will absolutely be staying at Helen’s House again when I’m back in the area!"

Stayed one night",By far the best Airbnb I have stayed in. Lauryn was extremely helpful and kind and responsive if I had any questions. Would 100% stay again and recommend if you need a place to get away and relax. The house itself was beautiful and even better than photos can show! It was fully stocked with anything you may need. Can’t say enough about this place!

Stayed a few nights",This was the best Airbnb experience my family had had. We stay across the US traveling for lacrosse and this has been by far the best. Lauryn was very responsive and proactive making sure we got in ok and felt safe and comfortable. Lauryn also had some golf clubs delivered so my son could golf in between games. The house was as described and more! The view was awesome and it was close to everything we needed. I will definitely be staying there again! Highly recommended!!!

Stayed with kids","I wish I could bring this house with me to everywhere I travel! This was one of the best AirBnB houses that I have ever had. Everything was clean, brand new, and in excellent condition. This house had the most comfortable beds I have had at an AirBnB. The host is extremely nice and responsive. There were crayons and coloring books left for my kids, along with a handwritten note.
This was very much appreciated by my daughters. We only stayed one night, but I wish it was more. I will definitely stay here again if in the Allentown area."

Stayed a few nights",We had a very pleasant stay. The townhouse is very well decorated. It rained a ton while we there. The electric fireplace was really nice to have even thought it was summer. The A/C works great! The kitchen is well stocked. Coffee and Syrups were a very nice touch. The house is very welcoming and cozy. Beds were comfortable. Only one full bath. The other bathroom is just toilet/sink. We didn't have any problems with only one shower. Lauryn has really thought of everything to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. The only thing that I didn't like was the use of plug in scent freshners. They were in everyroom. It was too overwhelming for us. Otherwise I would recommend staying at this Airbnb 100%.

My wife and I unfortunately had our hot air balloon ride cancelled. I reached out to Lauryn for local recommendations. She essentially gave us a two day itinerary. She has to be one of the very best hosts I've ever had. I fully recommend the house and the story behind it as well.
We loved the house and it was every bit worth it. Thank you Lauryn for saving our anniversary!!!!"

Group trip","Our stay at Hellen’s House was nothing less than perfect! It exceeded our expectations. The hospitality that Lauryn provided was top tier. All the amenities, supplies, and comforts were amazing. The coffee bar was fully stocked and we enjoyed it every morning we were there. We stayed here after a concert so Lauryn left us some late night snacks and waters in the fridge! The best part was the accommodation that she provided so we could stay at this lovely place another night even though she had another guest checking in the same day we were leaving. If I could give this stay 100 stars, I would without hesitation! Thank you so much Lauryn. We definitely will be back!"

Stayed one night","This is the BEST place to stay in Allentown! We needed a last minute booking for a work trip to Allentown and this place was both the nicest looking and had the best rate in town! The pictures perfectly represent the clean, modern and well maintained home that you will experience. Even better, Lauryn is the most responsive and accommodating AirBnB host I have ever booked with. Our booking was instantly granted, Lauryn responded immediately to any and all messages we sent her and she made for a very easy check in with our late night arrival. The home is pristine and located in a safe and quiet neighborhood, offers two parking spaces right out front, has keypad door access for a simple self check-in and, to top it off, has the most comfortable beds you could imagine. This is what you hope for in an AirBnB!"

Stayed with kids","Lauryn's place was beautiful, clean, and fabulous. The beds were deliciously comfortable. The finishes and decor were fabulous. There were robes, extra toiletries, a great coffee bar and accouterments. There was tons of room and even a great work station. A couple of restaurants were a short walk away, and a quick drive got you to a dozen more (I highly recommend Notch). Plenty of grocery stores and other shops were close by, and access/ parking was easy.
Lauryn was super helpful, responsive, and accommodating. She added personal touches that made us feel right at home. Check-in was clear and easy. I can not recommend this place more. I have stayed in Airbnbs all over the US, Europe, and Puerto Rico, and I have never been more pleased than I was here.
Absolutely a 10 out of 10 experience!"

The kitchen is so well stocked (plenty of pots and pans, appliances, cutlery, tools, etc.) that I regretted that I hadn't planned on cooking while I was there. Every room is welcoming and thoughtfully decorated (my 17 year old son exclaimed, ""is she an interior designer?""), and every need has been anticipated. My son is starting at Muhlenberg college in the fall and I'm guessing we're going to come back to Lauryn's every time we visit! I can't recommend it highly enough."

Plenty of room in the living room, kitchen, and bedrooms. Everything was very clean and Joseph was very responsive to all of my requests and questions. There was also plenty of stuff for us to use for the kids, like a pack-n-play, changing table, and a washer and dryer that helped a lot. We had to extend our stay by two days, and Joseph was very helpful and accepting of the late change to our itinerary. This place worked out very well for our situation and I can't thank Joseph enough. I recommend staying here if you're visiting Allentown and I will likely suggest this place to any family or friends visiting us! Thanks again Joseph!"

It is perfectly located to our favorite spots like the Rose Gardens, Trexler Park, Wegman's & it's easy to get to the highways. We got takeout from Biaggio's which & conveniently located in the same plaza as the wine & liquor store and grocery store Weis. Since it is winter we didn't get to sit outside but when we come in the summer we will definitely enjoy it.
I highly recommend staying here."

Our two-night stay, from 12/30/23 to 01/01/2024, allowed us to enjoy the beautiful surroundings and conveniently explore Blue Mountain Ski resort for some delightful snowtubing.

We came for the US Cycling National Championships, which were held at the Valley Preferred Cycling Center, and ended up staying here for 10 days. For those of you coming to the area to race at the T-Town track in Trexlertown, this is super close. Absolutely loved this house. Super convenient to food stores, shopping and gas stations too. Really nice park right across the street to enjoy. We were so comfortable here, it felt like home. We look forward to staying here every time we come back for Races. Highly recommend this house."

We cooked our own breakfast and kitchen has spices and coffee maker and Wayne dropped by to provide more coffee pods which is great. Wayne is an incredible host. When we checked out and accidentally left a valuable piece of jewelry and didn’t realize it until we got back to Utah, Aisha and Wayne were so accommodating that they dropped it off to my brother-in-law’s office the same day.

Stayed one night","Wayne had a very beautiful home in a good location. He showed up shortly after our arrival and showed us around the house. I selected the option to have the entire place to myself but he was sleeping in the house and stated that only the right side was available to us. Later on 2 of our friends from the area came over to eat with us and he called us promptly to tell us that he would be calling the police if they did not leave because they were intruders?! When we were leaving in the morning I walked out to put some of our bags in the car & when I turned around he was standing behind me silently. He startled me and simply said good morning but I could tell he was upset and I was creeped out by the fact that he knew our every move. It was well before check out time so him being there was just odd. At this point we decided to leave right away instead of staying for the last hour to clean up the small mess we made like we had originally planned because this was not the first time he popped up on us. Before we left, he made sure to harass us again stating if we did not give him our friends contact information he would be calling the police immediately. I'm pretty sure this is just something he says often due to finding a letter in the house that he wrote to one of his tenants saying the same thing. Overall the area was very nice but the host ruined our stay. We paid to have the entire place to ourselves but he was staying in the house and also knew our every move to the point that he had to have been watching us and cameras would not surprise me. Lastly for about 2 hours after we checked out the host was messaging me about a missing remote controller that he was claiming we took, he billed for it then later had to cancel the bill due to the remote still being there."

Stayed a few nights","Julia and Wayne’s house was simply perfect for our weekend in the Lehigh Valley. The kitchen was stunning, the beds were incredibly comfy and the couch! Holy moly. SO great. It was great how Julia greeted me and showed me the ins and outs of the house. Even though it’s a shared space and not technically the entire house, I didn’t even notice they were there. We had all the privacy in the world, which was just what one would hope. The BEST part was the amazing view of the Parkway and secondly, how close it was to both downtown Allentown and Bethlehem. And it’s a lot bigger than the photos show. And it was super super clean. I would definitely recommend this place to out of towners!"

I wish it had been nice out so that we could have used the back patio and fire pit. Very comfortable and clean house. Loved the double sinks in the bathroom and the rain shower.

My colleague and I stayed for a few nights while working in nearby Emmaus, and we loved staying at Wayne and Julia's place. The living room was so big we were able to stretch out and do yoga after work - a great way to wind down the day. They're right by the Parkway, which is a beautiful park with a running trail and stream in the middle of Allentown. We had a lovely time in the winter and it would be even better in the summer! Julia was very thoughtful and made sure we had everything we needed, but we also had completely privacy. Great stay."

The pictures do not do this place justice. It's incredibly stunning and open with so many amenities (K-Cups galore!) Plus the king bed was like sleeping on a cloud! Close to where we needed to be but also felt secluded. Would definitely love to stay again! Thanks so much for allowing us to stay, Julia and Wayne!"

Wayne and Julia are friendly and experienced hosts. This home is located across the street from the famous Rose Gardens which also hosts walking/jogging paths. It's location is excellent and close to restaurants, grocery stores, Dorney Park, Lehigh County Velodrome, DaVinci Science Center and local colleges.

Stayed one night","This was my first Airbnb experience.
Searching for hotels in Bethlehem, Pa, a couple of months before my niece’s college graduation proved surprisingly challenging, so I expanded my search to Airbnb. Wayne’s place in nearby Allentown seemed by far the best available, so I snapped it up. (The second bedroom was a definite plus with three adults travelling.)
My wife, son and I were greeted warmly by Wayne upon arrival. He showed us the living/dining area and kitchen of his home, and the adjacent, separate area of our rooms. (He also told us that there were four local colleges having graduations right around then – thereby explaining the unexpected lack of decent, reasonably priced hotel rooms.) He suggested some local restaurants for dinner, then he left us alone; after making sure we knew he was available if we had questions or needs.
Since we just basically needed a place to lay our heads for the night, and were up and out fairly early the next morning; we did not get to see Wayne again. Still, we were pleased with our brief stay. Our rooms were clean, comfortable, private and quiet. We had access to the spacious living/dining area and kitchen. Wayne’s beautiful home is in a nice area and we would have liked to had time to visit the expansive park across the street.
For those of you who are suspicious of reviews with no negative comments, I’ll say that the TV channel selection was limited (no ESPN!) and the TV lacked an on-screen guide as to what was available. The only way to tell was to scroll through the channels. (Wayne can correct me if I’m wrong. I didn’t reach out to ask because it was relatively late by the time I was discovering this.)
In the event that I were to stay in the area again, I would be pleased to book Wayne’s lodgings once more. I am happy to recommend this listing."

I felt comfortable respected and most of all welcomed inside Mr. Wayne's home. I definitely would recommend this house 100 × 100.

Stayed a few nights","There is only one way I can sum up my experience at Wayne's house, AWESOME. He was able to accommodate our last minute request for a Sunday night check-in. When we arrived, he was there to greet us with a big smile. My husband, 1 year old son & myself felt so welcomed from the time we arrived until the time we left.

He has a beautiful ranch style home which is a perfect set up for an Airbnb. Wayne & another Airbnb guest stayed on the left side of the home while my family stayed on the other side. Everyone had their own bathroom and plenty of privacy. I never stayed at an Airbnb when the host stayed on the property but it was a great experience. Initially when Wayne stated there was another Airbnb guests already staying there, I was a little apprehensive. But I am so glad I still decided to book. We were all on a different schedule and interacted in the evening, which I enjoyed.

This is a great location for a single, couple and/or family. We had full access to the common area (kitchen, living room, dining room, washer/dryer). During the day, I would be working in the living room, while my son was watching TV in his play pen. It was like a home away from home. The internet also worked well.

Wayne was so kind to drive me to run an errand and also took us to the local playground. Wayne was like a mentor. He gave us insight on the area, car buying, home ownership & how to build wealth. Wayne has a wealth of knowledge that he is eager to share. It was by design that we stayed at his place. After leaving Wayne's home, I felt that he would not only be a great point of reference but he could also be a friend.

If you are looking for a safe environment, immaculate home & gracious host, there is no other place to stay but Wayne's home."

Stayed a few nights","2 years ago, my family and I had the absolute pleasure staying at Bonnie's Bethlehem location twice.
This time, we were attending the Army vs Navy game in Philadelphia and were intending on staying close to the city. However, our original booking wasn't what we expected and was actually inhabited (double booked). We contacted Bonnie, not only very last minute, but late (in the early AM hours) in desperate need of help and a place for my 4 children, husband and I. Not only did she remember us from 2 years ago and respond immediately, she welcomed our stay in the middle of the night and we drove to her beautiful place in Allentown. She came to the rescue and the Allentown home was just as home away from home, as her Bethlehem home was in January 2021. Regardless that we stayed further out from Philadelphia, I would never give staying in Allentown a second thought again if our travels have us attending something in the big city again. The Lehigh Valley area is always a favorite of ours!"

Group trip","100% Recommend this Airbnb and the host to anyone who is in the area and needs a relaxing, home away from home style stay!
Yes, It’s was CLEAN!
Exquisite interior decoration, all the amenities were as described —the ping pong table was a big hit!
We all also enjoyed the views both from the inside and a short walk away. — also, the local stores down by McDonald’s had everything you’d get in any major city.
Good Parking too!
The space was very accommodating to our group of 6 and the dinner table allowed for wonderful family style dinner!
PS: 🔥🔥🔥 Diversity books selection on the bookcase next to the dining table"

Stayed a few nights","Overall my experience was very positive. There are a few negatives worth noting, however, mostly related to accessibility and heating.
First the positives: The house is very cozy and tastefully decorated. The owner was responsive. We rented the house for a week around Thanksgiving 2021, and when we arrived we found a very nice Christmas tree lit in the family room - we appreciated this little extra as it made us feel welcome and more like ""home."" The kitchen and house was well stocked with essentials. The back yard has a very nice porch with lighting - great for entertaining guests; and there is a propane fire pit that works well. The owner was flexible when we asked for a little extra time to checkout.
I'm spending more time documenting the negatives since they may be a deal breaker for others (though they weren't for us, hence the high rating).
On the accessibility front, there are a LOT of stairs to climb, so you may not want to consider this house if anyone in your party is elderly or has trouble doing stairs. We had a 72-year-old woman in our group and she can do stairs but had some difficulty with this house. It is built on 4 levels, although one is the basement which holds only the ping pong table and washer/dryer. The move from level to level is only a half flight of stairs, however.
The front steps are the most troublesome. The first step is higher than the others. I didn't measure it but I'm sure it is significantly higher than standard stair height of 7.5 inches - maybe by as much as 2 inches. Both the railings on those steps are loose; I  wouldn't recommend anyone putting their full weight on those railings.
Inside, coming down the stairs from the top (bedroom) level to the middle (kitchen/family room/dining room) level, the railing is too short so you have to lean down over the first step to reach it. This would be an issue for anyone with balance issues.
Two of the stairs had low ceilings at the top, requiring tall people to stoop to avoid hitting their heads.
As far as heating is concerned, we came in November when temps were in the 20's at night time and I found the heating of the house very uneven. There is only a single heating zone, with the thermostat on the main (middle) level. The owner has left instructions to only set temps in the range of 68 to 72 degrees. We found that 68 at night left the upstairs bedrooms rather hot, so we wound up opening the window.
Some minor points with the bathrooms. Neither one had enough counter space for people to put their bathroom things on (especially the second bathroom on the lower level which had no counter at all). The upstairs bathroom has insufficient lighting for shaving or makeup. There were lights over the sink, but they didn't work. I couldn't find a switch to turn them on.
The oven was dirty when we arrived, obviously hadn't  been cleaned after the last renter. It was not a big deal, we wiped it down with paper towels and were able to use it.
As I say my experience was overall positive, so these negative points should not be overblown, but I am bringing them up so others know what to expect."

Stayed a few nights","Bonnie could not have created a more beautiful environment in her home. Her home is decorated beautifully and not only very comfortable and inviting, but a true inspiration of artful design. I don’t think we have ever stayed at an AirBNB before in which we had so many discussions about the design and artwork! Bonnie was very communicative and always available to help - which is always appreciated when renting an entire home and the host is offsite. Her home is very central in downtown Allentown (but extraordinarily quiet despite being in the city) and less than 10 minutes to the Allentown Fairgrounds (which is why we were in town). A well-appointed and spotless kitchen was very much appreciated and we especially enjoyed access to the Weber grill and fire pit where we enjoyed S’More Time together. All in all, it was the perfect location for a group of old friends to create new memories."

Stayed with kids","This was an awesome house. Worked perfect for the family which was my wife and I along with our son and his family which include a 1 1/2 year old and a 2 1/2 year old. The main living area was a good place for the kids. If you have little kids you may want to bring a kids gate to block the chairs. There are two sets of stairs to consider. We did bring a gate but didn't need it.
Back yard was great for the kids. Large and fenced in. The covered patio was a big plus. We used it for some meals and the wife and I enjoyed some wine out there as the grandkids were winding down inside. We enjoyed watching the rabbits in the back yard. There were around 5 individual ones and sometimes there antics were very amusing. If you were slow and quiet they would allow you to get within about 6 feet of them.
We also took advantage of the grill and fire ring in the back.
Location of the house was very good. It is in a very nice quiet area. We found a very nice play ground within walking distance.
We were in the area visiting my in-laws. They are getting older and it is no longer possible to stay with them.
Bonnie is great to work with. She responds quickly to any questions you may have.
We highly recommend this house and if available for future trips would rent it again!"

We loved our evenings by the fireplace! Definitely would recommend as a great place to stay in the winter, and will look to come back in the summer to make use of the outdoor fire pit and great patio."

Group trip","Look no further, this house is fantastic. The layout of the house, the design aesthetics down to the amenities were very well thought out for guests. It was like staying in a house right out of a designer magazine. The house manual was also a very nice touch. We ate breakfast out on the covered porch out back, hung out around the fire pit at night. The neighborhood is also a nice quiet area which was a bonus. The house is also in a great location where all of big family and friends attractions are very close by. Bonnie was an amazing host with quick responses, checkups to make sure we arrived, how we were enjoying our stay and helpful with instructions. It was a great way to get away with friends and we all agreed we’d definitely individually come back with our families to give them the experience we had. Thanks again for such a wonderful experience Bonnie!"

The bed and bath were fantastic, and if you don't know Wegman's, goooogle it because they have a location down the street. The only suggestion for Alrick is to consider stocking pots and pans. This place has a full kitchen, and unless I missed it, I think that stocking the kitchen may put this place over the top. And if I did miss it, apologies to this great host."

Overall handy to everything. We were only 15 min drive from Wind Creek event center
that we had bought tickets for a music concert. We would stay again.
Only a few things we would recommend be changed.
More cooking utensils and equipment / There was no toaster- had to use oven. Only 2 knives and forks.
No egg flipper and no tea towel to dry dishes. We went and bought and left there..
Very minor concerns. Great place!"

The place was great, the only concern I had was that the apartment above, if someone is fairly activity you will be keep awake at night as we were till 1 am but it was a Friday and Saturday night. Overall, the place was clean, the fridge did need a deep clean, but otherwise a great, wonderful, clean place to stay a night or two. I would recommend this spot to anyone visiting Allentown or the surrounding area."

Plus the lovely owner even had spare deodorant, mouth wash, tooth paste, etc. it was so nicely put together. We stayed for a few days and had weird airplane schedules and he allowed us to be flexible with check in and check out due to airplane schedules. He was super accommodating and willing to help. The down side is there is no parking other than street, but that’s not the owners fault. I would rate this 10/10. Would stay again in a heart beat."

Stayed a few nights","Great location, conscientious host. Decor was aesthetic, pleasing. Apartment was just big enough for the four of us. Might have been a little worried about there only being one bathroom at first but once we got there, the bathroom was sufficient for four. The layout of the bathroom allowed for my daughters to get ready in front of the mirror while I used the shower, the toilet had some privacy just be on the shower, so it worked out! We visited the town of Bethlehem and Bear Creek ski lodge. We had easy access to both from our location. Any shopping needs are within a five minute drive, everything from Dicks to Whole Foods to Target. This was a nice rental for us, I would like to know that there are many steps leading up to the apartment, so consider this if you have elderly or very young in your travel group. This did not pose any problem for us."

Stayed with kids","Great spot. They don’t call it “sky view” for no reason. The sky just looked gorgeous from the apartment window.
I traveled with two kids while they attended camp at Davinci Science Center locally.
Best features:
1. Great aesthetics. Looks just like the pics. Has great energy. Everything is new.
2. Shower water pressure GREATLY APPRECIATED. You can’t always get good pressure and it was heavenly for me.
3. Some nice games inside and outside the home. Great for spending family time. Was an added bonus
4. 2 min to Dorney park. Literally. Area had everything.
5. Charging ports EVERYWHERE. Very thoughtfully placed.
6. There were snacks and coffee etc left along with a Brita water jug in the fridge. Helpfully when you’re arriving.
If I have to go back to the area, definitely staying with Jill.
Jill is a lovely, warm and friendly business woman. Everything is very organized. Jill is super responsive and on it. You will have a great stay."

Stayed a few nights","Dear Future Guest,
We had the best experience ever during our stay at Jill's Cozy suite. The ladies and I did a weekend vacation to get away from the hustle and bustle of our busy lives and Jill's place was Perrrfect!!!
It all started with corresponding with Jill immediately after reserving her place. She responded to all of my messages within an hour or two of me sending them. She is one of the sweetest host I've ever met during my experience in staying at AirBnB's (in the past). We actually met Jill a few hours after our arrival and she gave us a complete tour of her property. She actually did this after a long work day and week.
Jill's suite is located in a quiet neighborhood and the location is perfect. Dunkin Donuts and Wawa's are both within walking distance to the suite and Costco, Wholes Food and many, many other stores/restaurants are all within a 3-5 minute drive from Jill's spot.
When we enter into this cozy suite, we instantly smelled the cleanliness of the suite and were most excited about how sparkling clean it looked (as we walked around admiring the decor).
Jill had an inventory of everything you would need to make your stay comfortable, starting with a basket full of treats sitting on the table, a basket of a variety of teas and things needed to flavor both your tea/coffee, a cabinet full of mostly used and needed seasonings and ending with all of the cleaning tools and products needed for you to keep the suite tidy during your stay. We all slept like babies on the comfortable beds that had fresh linens and soft comforters.
I can go on and on about Jill's cozy suite, but I am sure by now, you get my drift (lol).
Let's just say, this AirBnB has earned a 5 star rating from my friends and I and we do plan on returning one day in the near future.
Book your stay now because I can promise you this, you won't regret it!
Thanks for making our stay and experience wonderful Jill:-)
Sincerely,
The Foxy Ladies of Maryland"

Stayed a few nights","Jill’s place was very cute, cozy, and clean - perfect for a group of 4 of us for a girls’ weekend! The location was in a private, safe area with parking out front that easily fit all of our cars. Arriving and departing the apartment was simple with the two keypad doors. Jill made us feel welcome by greeting us with a smile and little touches that made us feel at home, including a light breakfast. There was plenty of space for us to relax and lounge around inside, and more than enough to explore outside of the Airbnb in the surrounding area. We had a delicious dinner at Notch with drinks and dessert afterwards at BJ’s Brewhouse and a fabulous brunch at the Shelby (highly recommend!) - all within 5 minutes. Blue Mountain Ski Resort was a quick 30 minute drive away with a great nearby ski rental shop HalfPipe946. We had a great experience and such friendly interactions with local people. Jill was quick and detailed with communication. I would definitely stay here again!"

The aesthetics flowed throughout the apartment from the wall colors, utensils, backsplash, paintings, comforters and amazing couch (we’d love to know where the couch came from to get our own!). Having 4 mirrors was a plus! There was plenty of storage for coats, bags, clothes and extras. By and large, we recommend this apartment and the only reason I wouldn’t say this is because we want it to be free for whenever we need it 🤣 (Oh and the bathroom was perfect! 🤩) Thanks Jose!"

Stayed a few nights","We loved staying at this great little apartment while going home to visit family and friends. It's an adorable space, perfect for 1-2 people. Seems to have been recently renovated, and it's clean, comfy and pretty quiet considering it's in a downtown area. Bed is super comfortable, shower is amazing. Great location--we walked to a couple of restaurants and the Allentown Farmer's Market. Parking on the street was never an issue, and often we found a spot right in front of the building. Check in was a piece of cake. Jose was super communicative and quick to respond when we asked for some items we couldn't find. Only drawback I could see is there is not a dedicated work space. There are stools and a spot on the counter where you could put a laptop, but it probably wouldn't be comfortable for a long period of time. Didn't matter to us, since we weren't there to work! We'll be back for sure!"

Some lights were on motion sensors, which was interesting but we would have preferred if they weren’t. Upon arrival there was a smell of pets but once the place aired out it was great. The bathroom had hair and body soaps. It was quite small though, particularly the shower. When I alerted the host to a beeping he drove in from out of town to fix it. He was very responsive.

Stayed one night",Great end of day find- booked late afternoon but quick response put us at ease. Great price and located on quiet street just block away from everything. At 6’ 1” there’s a support beam to beware of but I’d definitely book again.

Stayed one night","This was a great place. Super cute. Exactly as described. Quiet, comfortable. I've never had a pool table in an AirBnB before!
The bedroom was large with lots of space for luggage and a place to hang clothes. The bed was comfy and there were plenty of blankets for cold weather. We had planned to also use the fold down coach, but it was pretty stiff (like a regular sofa bed).
The decor is fun and quirky which I liked.
The shower is really nice with the large waterfall shower head. Super appreciated after a long drive. Lots of good food options in the neighborhood too. The friendly kitten who visited in the morning was a total bonus!"

Stayed one night","The place was very clean, tidy, and well set up. The bathroom was very nice and I may have had the best shower I have ever had in their shower. I enjoyed the pool table along with the nice TV and sound system. The bed was comfortable, but the couch (that turned into a bed) was pretty uncomfortable for my other guest. There’s more to say but I want to end it off with how I accidentally left something at their location and they were more than happy to mail it home to me. I’m not saying they would do that again for someone else, but I was extremely appreciative of that. I would 100% stay here again for my future visits to Blue Mountain. Thanks again! :)"

But the fragrance from the little wall dispensers was so over powering I instantly got a headache as soon as we walked in. I am allergic to the strong fragranced smells. If we would have know, we would not have stayed here. That should be in the description. We hunted them down and removed them but to late, five days with a headache; it about ruined our trip. The couch is a brick. Really uncomfortable to sit on. It looks nice but it was awful to sit on for five days. Sorry, this is my review and our experience."

Safe, secure, and very very clean. fun pool table and beautiful tv. Beautiful bedroom and was very comfy relaxing in the bed. The host was outstanding and very welcoming.

Stayed over a week","Stayed here for 6 weeks during a work contract. The space was clean on arrival. Hosts were responsive to questions/requests in a timely manner. Since it is a basement space, there were times when it was pretty loud d/t activity upstairs. During the last few weeks there was a pretty significant ant problem that arose. The hosts were responsive and sprayed/fumigated, which helped a little, but continued to be a problem throughout the end of my stay, regardless of how often I cleaned.
Overall, the space is in a good area - across the street from a school, so it's safe. Lots to do in the surrounding area. Parking available on the street, directly in front of the house. Would be a good choice for a short-term stay."

Stayed a few nights","This was our 2nd time staying at Rossi’s Green Guest House within the last three months and won’t be the last. We absolutely fell in love with this beautiful quiet place. The hosts are probably two of the kindest people I’ve met. Their response time is quite fast, and the instructions are crystal clear! Great location with restaurants, stores and and shops close by. A great outdoor space and seating area to enjoy reading a book, a cold drink and some cuddling. Although the mattress is not as comfortable compared to our Tempur-Pedic at home I still highly recommend this beautiful place!!
Thanks Rosaura and Roland for a wonderful weekend! We will be back, Kat and Angel!"

Stayed a few nights",Super cozy! Soon as I walked in it smelled great and felt inviting. Everything was just as described. Her and her husband were very nice and accommodating. They were quick to answer any questions I had. The mall and many places to eat were within a 5-10min drive. We even got to go axe throwing 7min away. Would definitely stay here again.

It was beautifully decorated on the inside."

Stayed one night","We absolutely loved staying here. Rosaura’s home is so cozy and clean- awesome bar, bathroom, and comfy space. You can’t beat the price for the location. We spent the day in Bethlehem and explored the Christmas village. The town is so cute and has excellent restaurants. At night we went to Windham Creek casino. Everything is about 10 minutes from Rosaura’s.
She had the fireplace going when we walked in. It was spotless and so cozy! We’re inspired to redo our own basement to make it like Rosaura’s! She is communicative and clear. We’ll be back next year!"

My husband, 8 year old sister, and I spent the weekend here visiting Bethlehem for the Christmas festivities, which was conveniently located only a 10 minute drive away! The apartment was so cute and cozy, and we LOVED playing pool together! We watched Christmas movies on the couch and the bed was big enough to fit the three of us. Thanks for an awesome stay!"

Thanks for hosting us!"

The shower itself is worth staying here for. The bedroom has beautiful furniture and the fireplace is the perfect touch. The bar is adorable and a great picture opportunity especially for a couple or girl’s night. I will absolutely be staying again.

Rosaura was prompt with responses, and the house rules are more than fair. So many great eateries locally, Copperhead was delish! I'd recommend Rosaura again and again! Can't say enough, it was beyond expectations!"

Stayed a few nights","We absolutely loved our stay. The room is exactly as described. The bed is comfortable, the fridge is a larger size mini fridge, the microwave works, they provided not only a coffee pot but coffee too, we enjoyed playing pool, and being able to use their Netflix and Prime video is a great perk. Don’t let the No flushing of toilet paper scare you away. It’s really not a big deal! We were Leary of it but it really was NOT a big deal. The couple couldn’t have been nicer if they tried. So accommodating!!! Ron got the fire going for us because the wood had gotten wet. Rosaura checked on us to make sure we had everything we needed. She had left me a welcome gift because I was apparently the first to book on line and she remembered that my mother in law and I were celebrating our birthdays together a few months late. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it. It was in a great location also. 👍💕❤️🤩"

Check in was easy and there was room for 1 car in the driveway so no need to park in the street. We were in town for just one night and it was perfect for our stay. We will stay here again if we are ever back in town.

Stayed a few nights","People were extremely nice and attentive. They respond to you right away and so their absolute best to accommodate you. But I don’t think it’s worth 100/night. Note that it is a basement and you need to go almost to a hole looking for the entrance. My 6ft husband had to tilt his head couldn’t stand firmly because ceilings were kinda low. It is VERY LOUD you can hear every conversation and footstep from upstairs almost like they are next to you. Bed quality was bad you could feel every spring on it. Bugs kept coming out from nowhere as it is a basement. Like other review said, showers were chef kiss"

Rosaura and Ronald are just the nicest people you could ever want to meet too. I wouldn't hesitate if I were you: book their place if you can!
(added bonus? the most fabulous shower you will ever have! just wait until you try it! :-) )"

This was much needed and the host was amazing ! Extremely clean and answered question immediately when it was needed (which was only once because Everything is explained so well). They had a beautiful home in a beautiful safe convenient area.
And they really out did themselves with the interior design. If your looking to book in Lehigh valley area. Your search ends here! This is the one!
I Will be back again!! And I recommend everyone who plans on staying in the LV area to book this stay! You will Not regret it!"

Communication was very good and the hosts are very friendly. It was perfect for what we needed. One thing to mention is that the ceilings are low in the bedroom. We would recommend staying here if you're in or near the Allentown area.
