Stayed one night","Theresa I was in the middle of a busy day when I left such a short initial review, but I now get a second chance. Theresa was so kind to get us out of a bind when another Airbnb was not suitable by responding within minutes to our request. Always kind and responsive. She takes pride in her Airbnb and it shows with the attention to detail and immaculate condition. The hot tub is a bonus to such a lovely home. She had filtered water, ice, and made an extra trip to make sure we had goodies in the morning to eat. You will not be disappointed with this Airbnb."

Stayed a few nights","We stood on the porch in the morning listening to a cacophony of birds all around us. We heard at least 10 different bird calls- it felt like we were in an aviary, or a forest. Two massive mules behind a fence that were curious about us. It was nestled right against the mountains and beautiful. Quiet. The house was clean and gorgeously furnished. The bed was comfortable. Allyson was helpful and responsive, calling my sister after her SOS text about how to get in, talking her through the process. I'd definitely stay again."

Access to Sierra Vista’s restaurants and any shopping needs are close by yet being in the heart of the many canyons to explore is what we love most. The cottage offers privacy and all the features needed for a comfortable and relaxing stay. The history of this part of SE Arizona is right outside and available for you to explore and enjoy. Allyson and Lee are 5 🌟hosts.

We both like to hike and rock climb, and the cottage was conveniently located close to both activities. It was peaceful, quiet, and had beautiful views of the mountains around Ramsey Canyon. The kitchen was well equipped and surprisingly spacious. Allyson was very thoughtful and welcomed us with a heartfelt note and a delicious bottle of wine to help us toast our 40 years together! I highly recommend this place for anyone desiring a quiet romantic getaway with lots of outdoor activities just minutes away from your front door!"

Stayed one night","We loved Allyson's Sky Island Escape Cottage! From the time we drove up, with quail running across the driveway, to the time we left with roosters crowing in the distance, we had the most relaxing, peaceful stay ever! The cottage is stocked with everything that we could have wanted - Keurig pods, nice shampoo/conditioner/soap, full laundry, well stocked kitchen, and a really comfortable bed. We could easily stay comfortably for an extended period. Allyson even provided pasta and sauce for an easy dinner! One of the nicest features were the most comfortable glider/rockers on the front porch! We loved them! We had a glass of wine and appetizers as the sun went down, then chatted well after dark. Just perfect in every way. If we are back in the Sierra Vista/Bisbee/Tombstone area, we will definitely stay here again. FYI - loved the coffee at Nirvana's Cup of Joe and Urbano...just minutes away!"

The house was a perfect launching point for enjoying the outdoors in Ramsey Canyon, Carr Canyon, and Ash Canyon, and there were great restaurants just minutes away. We also loved spending mornings and evenings on the porch in the comfy glider chairs - and even saw and heard barn owls and great horned owls from the back yard!"

It felt like a home away from home when I needed it. Beautifully appointed, cozy and comfortable, Allyson and Lee have thought of literally everything you could need or want during your stay. They are friendly and very responsive to any questions that arise during your stay. I have stayed in many AirBnb’s and this was at the top of my list.

Stayed over a week","This lovely, quiet, and well appointed cottage had all the amenities we could have asked for. It's location is in the back of the owner's property. It is fenced in and felt very private and safe. We thoughly enjoyed the cute donkeys next door who were very quiet and well cared for. Allyson anticipated every need we might have had. She went the extra mile in providing great quality bathroom products, such as shampoo, conditioner, soap, and lotion. She provided a generous quantity of kitchen cooking supplies (pots and pans), utensils, dish towels and dish soap. The seating area was very comfortable. The TV only has Roku, but we were able to keep up with the news. I think they do have vdeos, too. We would go back in a heartbeat!"

The back yard/patio is very spacious with a wonderful hot tub, games, fire-it, grill and more - had a large portion that was covered. Can't say enough nice things about this house/location. I suffered a loss in my family and Ali went the extra step to leave beautiful flowers with a lovely note. Top 5-star quality all the way around. Highly recommend this house/Ali to any visitors to Sierra Vista!!"

The house was very clean, stocked well, and the beds were comfortable.
The house was smaller than we realized and cozy for 8, but it worked. Everyone enjoyed the foosball.
The pool was a short walk from the house and had a hot tub as well. We did not get a chance to use the hot tub at the house.
The yard was small but had a nice picnic table where we had morning coffee and caught a couple of beautiful sunrises. A more comfortable chair on the porch would be nice.
This is in a neighborhood of closely built homes, but the noise was minimal.
We enjoyed our stay."

Group trip","We enjoyed our stay at the desert nest, and Ali was a great host. Very responsive and easy to reach. The home is very comfortable and I felt very safe in the neighborhood.
There were a couple of things we weren’t expecting, some of the skillets and utensils had to be scrubbed to remove left behind cooked food. The sheets were clean but had some stains that looked as though they may have washed with something that may have left a color stain.
To me, these are minor things that never bothered me and they would not change my overall impression of this home.
I would stay at this property again without question."

Stayed with kids","Can see how they became super hosts! I’m into privacy more than most, so I wasn’t a huge fan of the unplanned meetings, but all three times were so Zoey could offer my kids home-made treats, so who is going to complain about that? And Zoey is an immensely talented baker. I sampled all the treats for my kids and sheesh! She doesn’t miss! I think I also misunderstood what they meant my the pool being ‘solar heated’. I think they meant ‘heated by the sunlight’ whereas I thought it was heated by a solar cover. It was really cold and hot tub was covered. But my daughter had fun with the pool and playing ‘avoid the water’ anyway. Very clean, well-appointed property with everything we needed and more. Was not surprised to see Ron is a real estate agent. Stellar property. Great hosts!"

We were able to arrive on our own time due to some expected events they were more than understanding provided the code as well as clear tips for the road leading up especially driving at night. We arrived with a welcome board with our names on it. Zoey greeted us in the morning to provide the area updates and suggestions of where to visit and less than 30 minutes away. Because I lived in Hawaii and going to return Zoey graciously gave my husband's and I the updates and suggestions as they were just there the week prior. She then scurried off and encourage us to take advantage of the time and property. We had an event taht evening however she messaged about a dish I mentioned earlier and had made some which had me in tears. Not to mention the hiking trails, the deers and javelina sitings. Well needed rest and super duper hosts. We will be back!!"

It is best for a small family because the main room is a nicely furnished efficiency without a full stove top.

We (girls trip from NJ - myself and 2 daughters, aged 20 & 17) stayed at their incredibly hospitable cottage in the heart of the Southern Arizona mountains & canyons. Having never been to the Southwest, we were greeted with the most amazing views around Zoey & Ron's place. Birds, wildlife, peaceful quiet and a gorgeous pool! Our hosts provided everything we could ever need and then some. We had very busy and packed days and every day we were so excited to head back to the comfort of the cottage. It was so cozy and inviting that we felt like we were headed home. It was that much of a welcomed feeling. We relaxed by the pool in the early evenings and the girls even swam under the moonlight. There are so many cool things to do in the area and Zoey helped guide and us every step of the way. She was unbelievably helpful and caring. We did NOT want to leave and will miss Arizona and our awesome hosts!!!!"

She even offered so graciously to do a small load of laundry for me. I couldn’t have imagined a better hostess and overall stay.
My time at their place was nothing short of perfect. The kindness, hospitality, and generosity, was something I’ll never forget.

The bed and fold-out couch were both very comfortable, the bathroom and roomy shower a pleasure to refresh in, and the location couldn’t be beat. You’ll feel as if you’re much further out in the country, but it’s only a quick 4-minute drive to Highway 92. The Huachuca Mountains rise in splendor behind the Casita and watching the morning sun illuminate them with a hot cup of Joe was memorable. We especially enjoyed the small placards with words of wisdom scattered about. It’s clear a great deal of loving and careful thought has been put into every detail here, and we can’t think of a better place to lodge again when we’re in the area."

She thought of everything, including the suggestion that we stop and get groceries on the way since we were arriving late so we could relax once we arrived! Her recommendations of things to do couldnt have been more spot on….the hikes, places to eat etc. I have never had a host be so responsive every time we reached out! We felt so taken care of. We were lucky enough to meet Zoey and she is lovely! Private location but close to Bizbee and Tombstone and more!"

We were not sure what to expect in regards to its location but we’re blown away by the views of the mountains and property. The pool is breath taking all on its own! The room is separate from the house and connected to the game room. We definitely enjoyed some healthy competition with the pool table. We also enjoyed every second of the pool and had it all to ourselves. The owners were absolutely kind and offered tons of ideas of things to see around the area. We were beyond appreciative by our experience and hope to visit again in the future! Thank you so much Ron & Zoey!

Unfortunately, we weren't there long enough to take advantage of all the features available to us such as the beautiful swimming pool. The highlight for me, as a birder was the Phainopepla that visited the pool area and the location was great for accessing all the birding hotspots in the Huachuca Mountains. Excellent value, much better than staying in a generic hotel."

Having only an outdoor kitchen could be challenging but if the weather is right for being poolside, it's great. There are also plenty of great local restaurants. Zoey made every effort to make sure we had everything we needed and were comfortable. The house is on the road to Ramsey Canyon and very near Ash Canyon, so if you are a birder, this is a perfect location. Roadrunners and Gambel's quail were seen from the property and in season, Zoey has many hummingbird feeders around the pool."

The pool area blew away my expectations. The temperature of the water was absolutely perfect. There is also an area to sit and watch the sunset or enjoy your morning cup of coffee looking out over the trees and mountains. You don't even realize you're in a populated area. Truly a wonderful little gem with gracious hosts. Thank you again for sharing your home!"

Additionally, the drive to Fort Huachuca is manageable. Not only was the Casita a sanctuary, it is adjacent to the garage with games, darts, and pool table for fun times! What makes this Airbnb so special is not only the place to sleep and relax, but the generous hospitality of the hosts, Zoey and Ron."

Stayed a few nights","Private, spotless, luxurious, peaceful serenity in paradise... This beautiful casita has it all. From the hosts, who are absolutely some of the most genuine and caring people I’ve ever met. Ron was very friendly, and Zoey and I visited daily. She’s a treasure. We really connected on a soulful level. I actually felt sad leaving their space as she now feels like family and I miss her calming energy and loving demeanor already. She went above and beyond to accommodate myself and my family. To the weather, which was perfect during our stay. The pool and Ramada were functional, beautiful and felt like we were living the life of the rich and famous.. The amenities provided made everything convenient and and stress free. Zoey has thought of it all. Plenty of clean towels, bath and body products, snacks etc.. The space was extremely clean and we felt very safe and supported during our stay. The property is about 10 minutes outside of town, but close enough to everything that a quick trip to the store or restaurants were a breeze. They even were able to accommodate my 32ft RV, and when I had a mechanical issue offered to assist me with getting it resolved. So amazing!! My heart is so full as I reflect on our unforgettable time there. I highly recommend this space as a restful retreat for a single, couple or small family. They have another property which can accommodate a larger family. I am looking forward to returning as soon as possible. This was hands down the best Airbnb experience I’ve ever had!! Easily 10 + stars. I feel blessed to have been given the opportunity to stay here and connect with truly pure souls. Don’t hesitate to book your stay! Take care, Ron & Zoey! Until we meet again!! Xoxo"

Stayed one night","The location, privacy, and relaxation factor is unmatched. It was 100% private and felt like home. The pool was amazing and staring up at the mountains made it tranquil and exactly what we needed. Communication was constant to include while we were there and after. Check in was seamless and I had mentioned it was my girlfriends birthday and they added personal touches like fruit, a flower, and even a personalized sign. I have never seen her so happy. There was not a single thing out of place and was much better then described. If you have a chance to stay here, even as a staycation, it'll be well worth it. We are looking for a way to come back in the very near future with no need to look anywhere else."

Stayed a few nights","We had a fabulous stay! This home was 5++++ stars!
From the very start, Tracy & Doug were friendly and quick to respond to any & all questions or concerns.
The keyless entry with your own personal code is awesome. One tip: give the door a good push after keying in your code. Once we learned to do that, getting in was easy-peasy.
The house is IMMACULATE. Cleaner than mine, that's for sure! It is beautifully furnished in a southwestern motif, very tastefully done. It looked brand new. Also very comfortable. The sofa was comfy and the beds were comfy as well - nice & firm, but not rock hard.
The kitchen pantry is full of appliances to choose from. We used the drip coffee maker & toaster. Coffee filters were provided. Dishes were ample & adequate.
Location is great. It's in a quiet neighborhood but close to shopping and places to eat. It was a good home base for our adventures to Tombstone, Bisbee & Kartchner Caverns.
We would definitely stay here again!"

The fireplace was a delight to warm up by and I enjoyed the patio to catch some morning rays as well as sunsets.

Felt very safe, neighbors made us feel welcomed with kindly waves of hello/goodbye. When in the Sierra Vista area I would definitely see if the rental is available. Layout of home and colors add to the beauty of the home. Back yard is relaxing. Eddie was quick to respond to any question or concerns that we had, and was polite to check up on us to make sure we were comfortable or needed anything"

1. There are 4 dogs. When we arrived, they kept barking. That was scary to us and we barely dared to go through the backyard and went to the room though they were locked in the house or another part of the yard. Steven was responsive after I messaged him.
2. There was only one thin blanket on the bed. And it was cold on the night of Dec though we opened the heater.
But the price was reasonable."

The location is a bit rural but good for getting to Sierra Vista or Bisbee. There are dogs on the property that are very friendly and bark a little but got along well w my dog through the fence. Steven was very responsive when I requested more creamer and other items. Friendly host and the value cannot be beat!"

The host communicated well and I was very comfortable throughout the stay. My only note would be that there are dogs next door that are fence reactive and interested in fence fighting. This wasn’t a problem for my trained dogs but something for visitors to be aware of before letting the dogs out into the yard. I would absolutely love to stay here again next time I’m in the area!!

There was plenty of space for everyone and was very comfortable. Drank coffee in the screened in area every morning and watched the sunrise. The only issue we had was we didn’t realize it had a swamp cooler and it kind of made everything feel damp. We also had a night after it rained where the door wouldn’t open. Luckily we had the emergency key with us. Would gladly stay there again though and thoroughly enjoyed it."

Not only was the house welcoming and cozy, but it was spacious and comfortable. Pretty much everything you have at home was provided for you. Couch blankets, extra pillows, tea kettle, even candy treats for my children, and so much more. The design of the home was thoughtful and yes, has a washer and dryer too. This was an excellent stay!

Group trip",We stayed at the Gathering Place for just one night while on a west coast trip from NY and this was part of our plans to take my parents to Tombstone while in Arizona. We couldn’t tell much about the area because we came in after it was dark but we still loved how peaceful it was. The home is so cozy and Staci did such a wonderful job making sure everyone felt at home. She left us chocolates and the bathroom even had amenities that you wouldn’t even find in a hotel room. Beds were super comfy and we woke up to a beautiful view with birds chirping all around us. We had breakfast out on the front yard and we absolutely loved it. The Gathering Place has everything you would need and then some. Would definitely want to stay here again if we’re ever back in the area. Thank you Staci for being so thoughtful about your guests.

The yard is lovely, the front has an incredible view of the mountains, and the patios (front and screened-in back) are perfect gathering places. This is a great house for multiple people or families because there are so many living spaces to go to if you need a little alone time. Finally, Staci was so quick to respond!

The beds are comfortable, the sofas are great to lounge on, and there is plenty of room just for hanging out. The kitchen is well furnished so you can cook easily. The outside space is inviting. We all liked the mountain views and hearing the owl nearby. I hope to have a chance to stay here again."

With 4 little ones they were desperate for comfort and The Gathering place provided just that and more! The grand gestures of coffee, wine and even a welcome gift for my kiddos was beyond what we could ever ask for.

We really appreciated the portable crib (a small pack-and-play type), the booster seat high chair, baby walker, and various other toys/items. Additionally, the hosts have screened in the porch since our first visit. We had a nice evening grilling and eating in the new screened in porch with views of the mountains. As before, the place was immaculately clean, the bed was very comfortable and there was plenty of hot water. There were also various extras that were much appreciated--a bottle of wine, box of girl scout cookies, etc. The cooling in the summer is via swamp cooler, so it's a bit humid but the temperature remained comfortable, especially with the ceiling fan in the master bedroom. We'd definitely recommend this house for a stay in Sierra Vista."

A sing in the front porch. A dinning table right outside the kitchen to enjoy the morning or evening atmosphere. As well as an enclosed back yard with fire pit and sitting and dinning area to enjoy with your children and fur babies.

Stayed a few nights","Staci and Jaclyn are excellent Airbnb hosts. Their home is spacious and comfortable and well appointed with everything needed to spread out, relax, and enjoy. Whenever we had questions, they responded quickly. We enjoyed dinner on the patio one evening. There’s a swing for two and more casual seating in the backyard. The beds were very comfortable and we slept very well. It was a delight to stay at Staci’s place."

We enjoyed it while my husband and I were celebrating our 28 wedding anniversary with our 3 four legged doggie-daughters. Great place for pets, as yard is fenced in all around, complete with doggie door into house! They pay so close attention to details that they provide doggie bowls and poopie bags for clean up. This place is very kid/family-friendly from the little plates I saw in the kitchen, to the play toys for the tub! Our main purpose was to hike. Many trails to take in all directions! We will book again!"

The kitchen was so well equipped and had everything the six of us needed to cook breakfast and drink many pots of coffee. There was even a coffee grinder! The well-stocked game cabinet turned out to be a great addition and we spent many hours playing and laughing.
Everything was super clean, easy, and comfortable. Thanks for the home away from home!"

Stayed a few nights","This place was perfect for us. The house was immaculate with all the amenities you might desire, and plenty of space. It was quiet with a beautiful view of the mountains. As a serious amateur photographer, especially wildlife, I chose to come to Sierra Vista because it is one of the top three birding areas in the country. Lupita's place is convenient to all of the popular sites for birding. It took no more than 15 minutes to reach any of them, except for one that went up a mountain on a really rough road. But, no matter your reason for visiting Sierra Vista, I highly recommend this place."

We were able to walk a nice trail to Brown House from the house. Our granddaughter was pleased to find toys in the kids' closet & it kept her busy when she visited. We felt like we were staying in family's home as it was warm & accommodating and had everything we could ever need. Thanks Lupita!"

The beds were comfy and warm, the kitchen was awesome and stocked with everything we could want. She even added some extra goodies that were appreciated and tasty.
Bathrooms were spotless and plenty of hot water for 3 adults. Bedrooms were good sized and super clean as well. The fire pit out back was nice even if it WAS a bit cold. lol. The neighbors were friendly and quiet and there were restaurants and stores within an easy drive.
Lupita responded quickly to our few questions (mostly about where to get something to eat) and was friendly the whole time. We would absolutely stay here again if in the area. We were in the area to check out Bisbee and are 100% glad we stayed here vs hotels. If you're looking, this is the place you want."

Stayed about a week","We were in town to attend Southwest Wings birding festival - our stay was a week. What a fabulous home. We felt right at home the minute we walked in the door upon arrival. As birders, we were super excited to see the wildlife in our own acre+ yard. The views of the mountains was spectacular - we were blessed to see a sunrise and the full moon setting one morning over the mountains with our expansive view. The neighborhood is very quiet and walk-able. Sierra Vista is not a humongous town so even though you are a little south of the stores/restaurants - it's only a few miles to get anywhere. Lupita has everything you would ever need - plus more - provided in the house. We only cooked one night but found everything we needed. The beds and furnishings are comfortable. The house is quiet and large enough for a few couples or a family to share. Again, Lupita goes above and beyond with what she provides for your comfort. We had a fabulous stay and would come back in a heartbeat!"

And if you're a stargazer, this location will not disappoint. I'd definitely stay here again on future visits to Sierra Vista."

Stayed with kids","There aren’t enough stars to give to this place! Lupita’s home is not only spotless clean, unbelievably welcoming and cozy but she goes above and beyond by having a few snacks available and some bottled waters, coffee/tea/sugar/creamers and even some pancake and muffin mix available. These things are so nice especially after a long day of travel to actually be able to walk in and not have to immediately find a store just to have a few things. The kitchen has anything you would need to make any meal from the plates to the strainer to the cookie sheets and anything in between!
My husband myself and our 6&9 year old were here. We didn’t even use the upstairs at all since we didn’t want to have kids downstairs alone.
(that’s just us since unfamiliar area/people.... we wld do the same anywhere we don’t know). The downstairs bedrooms are so roomy and she has the greatest futons in each bedroom. Beds were so comfy even the blankets and pillows were super cozy.
How amazing that there was even shampoo and cond and body washes in the bathroom!
I could just keep going on here!
As far as I’m concerned Lupita is the gold standard for what AIRBNBs SHOULD be!
If you considering booking this place ...... just go ahead and do it.... you won’t be disappointed !!!"

The location has stunning mountain views on all sides and close proximity to a paved walking / biking trail which we enjoyed each morning.
Communication with Lupita was superb, and she had thought of every detail to make finding and staying at her home a pleasure. We have stayed at many Air BnB's all over US and abroad, and this is one of the best we've ever seen. If you have the opportunity to book with Lupita, don't hesitate.

We had plenty of cooking utensils, entertainment options, miscellaneous supplies… just about anything you might need and forgot to bring. She was also very available for any questions or special requests we had. The house is very comfortable and has a cozy vibe with a spectacular view of the mountains. We really enjoyed our time here."

Stayed with kids","I haven’t been giving reviews on the places we’ve stayed just because by the time we are home from traveling and usually exhausted, our lives get back to craziness and I just don’t have the time. I usually just tell friends, that we’ve had good luck with Airbnb. With that said, as I settled back into my own home tonite and thought how nice it was to be home and relax, I felt I really wanted to give Lupita a review. This home was just a beautiful place. Peaceful, comfortable, from the moment we walked in. Very spacious for my husband and I and two adult children that came with us. It was clean and smelled nice and Lupita had extra little amenities tucked everywhere. She really thought of everything that one might need while they were there. We had a couple of long stressful days of funeral services and this home was a place we could really just retreat to at the end of the day to relax and unwind. It’s in a wonderful location on the edge of town, so very quiet but yet just a very short drive to everything . I really felt at home here. We took a beautiful walk one morning and saw wild life and spent evenings in the private back patio looking at the mountains and sunset. I truly hope it’s available the next time we come to Sierra Vista. Definitely the best Airbnb we’ve stayed in."

I took off one star because there were plug-in air fresheners placed in every room and hallway, which I was allergic to. Luckily we were able to unplug them and air out the house."

The master bedroom gets bright, warm light all day with beautiful mountain views but all the windows have blinds to block it out if you need to nap. Lupita left a well-stocked kitchen and bathrooms. Everything we needed was provided. It’s a quiet neighborhood and Ramsey Canyon was less than 10 miles away. Easy check in and quick responses. We would definitely return!"

Host was thoughtful and even left some snacks for the kids. We’re a military family and this would make an excellent tdy home that we would refer to our friends.

Stayed with kids","Amazing property that made me feel like I was home. The beds were some of the most comfortable I have slept in, the towels were plush, and the house was spotless. The kitchen was fully stocked, we cooked multiple family meals and even ended up hosting Christmas dinner.
Jorge brought in a Christmas tree to help the home feel more festive for my 2 year old nephew, and the house was decorated for the holidays. There was a small snag prior to arrival, and Tessa worked tirelessly to come up with great solutions. Even the smallest details are important to Jorge and Tessa. This is THE PLACE to stay in Sierra Vista....10/10."

There was plenty of space for all of us and we did not have to worry about getting in each others way. Tessa and Jorge did an amazing job with remodeling and decorating the house. The whole house looks fresh and clean. The colored lights in kitchen and livingroom are a great feature. This house is in a nice quiet neighborhood. Perfect for morning walks. Tessa was very fast at responding back with any questions I had. The check in and check out procedure was very simple. Tessa and Jorge are a wonderful host!

Being able to park in the garage was nice and offering laundry detergent etc. was nice if there was a need to do laundry.

All of the beds are super comfy and the pillows were the best pillows I’ve ever slept on lol. This place is 10x better in person. The photos don’t represent how beautiful the layout truly is.

The house is very clean and nicely decorated to welcome you. We are actually looking to move to Sierra Vista and took a weeklong trip out, to make sure we like the area (coming from San Diego). We've scooted the area for property listings to buy and a rough idea what to expect. When we walked in my wife Jen said ""I want this one when we move here"" and I agreed.
It was just Jen and I on this trip, but this place would comfortably home a family. SV is a smaller community anyway, compared to what we are used to in San Diego, but everything is located close by. Read the other reviews and you will see that you will be happy here!"

We had 4 kids and 3 adults in our group and had plenty of space to spread out for down time as well as to gather together for a movie night or board games. The kitchen was well appointed - even having an ice cream scoop which we usually don’t find in Air BnB’s. The beds and pillows were comfortable, the temperature of the house was fantastic and the hosts were responsive and helpful.
We were in town to celebrate our son’s 9th birthday with a cowboy theme. We enjoyed going over to Wilcox and over to Tombstone. We even got to go to the batting cages, thanks to a tip about them in the guidebook when it rained and hailed the first day of our trip. We missed seeing several things on our list and are looking forward to coming back to explore more! Thanks again for everything!"

The house is newly renovated and beautiful! The kitchen is well equipped. Ice cube trays are available in the freezer as the refrigerator water and ice maker are not hooked up. There is every appliance that you would need and even storage containers for leftovers. TV is available but you must use your own streaming services and remember to delete the devices from your account. The location is great with grocery stores not far away and prime parks within short drives. The yard is all stone (arid area) yet corn hole game is provided for added fun. A great rental for a family or couples (3 bedrooms, 2 baths). We would definitely return."

It truly felt like a home away from home! We even enjoyed water from their new machine that makes water from the air (water vapor).

The casita has a very nice front porch that we loved. We sat there every evening with wine and cheese while we watched the hummingbirds and sunset.
Sarah is an outstanding host. She is a lovely person! We really enjoyed meeting her and Adam. She was very helpful and gave us recommendations for restaurants and grocery stores. We ate at 2 out of 3 of the restaurants she suggested and they were very good.

The casita is the best stocked Airbnb I've ever stayed in. Tupperware for leftovers! Flashlights and gloves for exploring a nearby cave! Treats to bribe their delightful little dogs! A welcome basket of snacks! Tasty coffee beans! A fire pit with logs and firestarters! Bird feeders (one for hummingbirds) outside the windows! A shampoo/conditioner/soap dispenser!
The location is a quiet street on the edge of town with views of the mountains. I came to hike and the casita was a great basecamp to explore a surprising variety of trails and attractions."

Stayed a few nights","This listing is a gem! I couldn't recommend it more highly. Sarah is a gracious host, extremely helpful, very knowledgeable about the area. She responded instantly when I had to adjust my reservation dates. All communication was timely. She provided additional photos (illustrating the parking area and passageway to the back of the house) and driving directions the day before arrival. She greeted me on arrival, when I had a chance to make friends with Alfie and Barley, the two dogs.
The listing description and photos are completely accurate, concise and precise. If anything, the spaciousness and comfort of the casita are only better when you see them in person. A comfortable bed with plenty of blankets. A full kitchen with utensils/pots/supplies galore. A gorgeous bathroom. Instant hot water! A desk the size of a door. Travel guides, maps, birding books. A firm reading chair and footstool. And the views to mountains - in two directions - are magnificent. A quiet, peaceful, relaxing place to stay!
Business at Ft. Huachuca? Working on your screenplay? Studying for finals? Biking on or off road? Hiking the nearby nature preserve? Tracking birds? (I saw hummingbirds at the feeders). Exploring southern Arizona? Day-tripping to Tucson? Sarah's casita is for you!"

The residents of the next unit will walk by the 1st patio when getting into their unit. However, there is a bamboo private screen/wall between the 2 units. Our patio was peaceful and private. The 1 bedroom apartment was quiet, private and had everything one needed for a very comfortable stay. A true home away from home. Allen and Priscilla were also kind enough to receive a small package on my behalf and to drop it off for me during our stay.

The entry to get to the apartment is compact and next to a busy road, but the apartment is quiet and you don’t hear too much.

As someone who was staying alone and not very familiar with the area, I felt a little exposed to be the only car in the parking lot with lots of cars and pedestrians around. However, once inside the gate you do not feel like you are off a main road. It was quiet and peaceful. Allen and Priscilla have done a great job with the space and were very communicative."

Stayed one night","The apartment is nicely set up and tidy inside as well as outside. Things I appreciated most included a spacious shower, a comfortable bed, and a cozy atmosphere. The location is terrific with several restaurants within walking distance. This was my first visit to Sierra Vista and I thoroughly enjoyed myself."

Stayed a few nights","I stayed at Allen & Priscilla’s Air BnB over the memorial weekend with my boyfriend. From the beginning, Priscilla was communicative and responded quickly. She accommodated our check in time, which we appreciated very much. The apartment was exactly what we needed, perfect for a couple or somebody traveling alone. Since our main interest was visiting Tombstone, I can’t say much about what to do in Sierra Vista, but the apartment’s location offered privacy and was close to gas stations, grocery store, Starbucks and a few fast food and non fast food restaurants. The apartment itself was very clean and offered many amenities. Overall, it was very comfortable to stay in. Thank you Allen & Priscilla!"

Stayed one night","The hosts, Allen & Priscilla, communicated so well. Their detailed instructions made a late night check-in very easy, and a warm lamp glow welcomed me into the home. It was pristine, spacious, comfortable and well-appointed. I sank into the soft bed and immediately fell into deep sleep. My only regret is that I couldn’t stay longer, as this place is quite a gem. The hosts obviously put a lot of thought and care into creating a home-away-from-home."

Allen & Priscilla were lovely and we had several chats over the days I was there. Spotless property, everything you could need for a week’s stay."

The place was amazing with the amenities like kitchen, microwave, hair dryer, Wi-Fi, television, shampoo, body wash and conditioner. This little oasis was a true gem 💎 to stay at and I wish I could stay longer. I would stay again. They genuinely care for their guests and put a lot of thought in their Airbnb. I was impressed with their kind hospitality. Thank you."

When we reached out to Allen and Priscilla with a question about the apartment, they responded immediately and offered a good solution. They were great hosts!"

Quiet because it's behind a business and the street noise. Very convenient to all the stores in town. A much better place to stay and more spacious than a motel room !!

Their place is very cozy, nicely decorated and well equipped. If you’re planning on doing the Queens copper mine tour which is excellent, then make sure you book online ahead of time! Coronado monument is a must! Amazing view at the top!"

Stayed a few nights","Allen & Priscilla's place was small and quaint. The location was perfect. We had a family member at the Fort Huachuka and it was very close for them to come over and visit. The directions for check in was spot on. We walked in and it was cute. There's a patio that we sat out on in the evening. The scenery wasn't the best, but that didn't bother us. Many close restaurants with in a couple of block's. This place has everything we needed. We didn't cook while we were there but it appeared the kitchen stocked. Allen and Priscilla's place was very clean. If I were to go back to Sierra Vista I would stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","Interesting location and the process you go through to access the apartment. My husband is a big guy so there is one lane walking traffic from your vehicle to the apartment. There are no stairs, just a super narrow walkway. The inside looks newly remodeled. We had what we needed as there were lots of provided amenities. The outside area was decorated to make for sitting outside comfortable. No views of the surrounding mountains, however. Maybe a mural of mountains could be painted on the brick wall. The inside is cute and comfortable. I'm just not sure how the entry and outside area could be more inviting, albeit, they are trying to have it be an inviting area. We had a bit of a problem with the TV receiving a signal, but worked through it with the host. It seemed quiet for being located a little ways back from the busy street. I guess we would stay there again"
