Stayed a few nights","i have stayed in many air bnbs, but zuhair's home is on a completely different level. it was the best place my husband and i have stayed in. the home is gorgeous, incredibly clean, welcoming, and cozy. we felt like we were on a houseboat and couldn't get over how great it was to experience such a cool home. the house sits off a busy road, but it's in a great location with close access to restaurants, downtown springfield, and bradley airport so we didn't mind. the surroundings are breathtaking and we enjoyed waking up to/sitting on the screened in porch listening to nature/watching the water. the home is equipped with everything you'd need: bluetooth speakers, games, extra blankets/towels, and even condiments! also, zuhair is friendly, knowledgable, and a pleasure to work with. he should teach a class on how to ""air bnb"" because he nailed it. new england is our second home and this will be our go to place. do yourself a favor and book this home. you will not regret it. thanks zuhair!"

Stayed with kids","If a six-star rating was a thing, this place rates. This stay was everything advertised, and more. A beautiful combination of peaceful and contemporary, with a dash of excellent communication by host. The rental is stylish, comfortable, and very clean. The host gives extra thought and attention to details and amenities that, in our experience, are typically overlooked. From health and wellness details like yoga mats, family games, and new plush furniture, beds, and home decor, to the solid communication and responsiveness from the host. We'd most definitely return anytime we're in the area."

Honestly such a great host would recommend to all my friends!

Stayed a few nights","We choice this property because of the proximity to my family. The property was just the right size for my husband, my 90 yr old dad and myself, along with being so cute. My family even visited and loved the property set on the Connecticut River. Zuhair was always making sure everything was great and we didn’t need anything. Will stay again if needed on our future visits to Agawam."

Stayed with kids","Zuhair is friendly and welcoming and did a nice job remodeling this little home.
We, (grandma, daughter and grandson), enjoyed our stay with a view of the Connecticut River. Nice clean bungalow with easy access to main travel corridors to surrounding towns and Connecticut.
Beds were firm, but comfortable. Heating was good. Grandson loved the hanging egg chair, large building blocks and television. Plenty of supplies in bathroom and kitchen. Fast hot water and filtered drinking water. Large parking area made it easy to get in and out.
Would stay here again when in the area."

Group trip","We feel so lucky to have found this riverside home, the most beautiful Airbnb we have experienced. It was the perfect size for our family, and absolutely tranquil - the screened in porch is the best place to watch the sunrise and sunset. We have never been welcomed with such an array of teas and coffees. The place was spotless, with every convenience having been considered - plenty of the softest blankets, lots of food containers for storing leftovers, a state of the art range and microwave…. We were able to work from the Airbnb because of the flawless wifi. Zuhair checked in regularly, not too much or too little, and any time we had any needs (like more paper towels), he dropped them at the door within an hour. The waterfall shower was a comfort every day! I have only positive words about this luxurious place. We hope to come back again!"

Stayed a few nights","We loved Zuhair's place!! it is immaculately clean, beautiful, cozy and has comfortable beds. The decor is perfect! There are so many good things to say about this place. All of the kichen utensils and iems are new and top quality. We loved the fireplace and the screened-in porch; being on the water was great! So close to The Big E fairgrounds. Lovely neighborhood, I took a walk along the Connecticut River on the Walking Trail; so nice! Zuhair was a great host; he communicated well and responded right away, so pleasant and helpful. He went above and beyond when my sister left an important item there; he found it and mailed it to her immediately; and she received it right away! I highly recommend this place and will definitely stay here in the future; if we are in the area."

Stayed one night","Wow! I clean for a living and am very particular. Zuhair's place was the cleanest airbnb that I've been to in a very long time! Thank you Zuhair! Here is a person that really cares about making his guests comfortable because he's thought of everything! There's even 2 types of coffee preps. The kayaks were great fun! The beds were comfortable and with all the natural light coming into the premises he has easy to use shades for each window that make sleeping enjoyable. Zuhair provided helpful links to know what's available for groceries and restaurants. My only issue is on me and it's that we could not stay longer. I had just one night to hurry up and relax!
Thank you so very much for your hospitality Zuhair!"

Stayed one night","My partner and I were looking for a scenic spot to stay the night passing through the area and this place was perfect! The setting on the river was great and very chill. We were drawn to the home mainly because of the outdoor space but, due to the rain, didn't get to use it. That didn't matter a bit though as watching and listening to the rain fall into the lush trees and onto the river was super cozy and very relaxing after a long drive. Zuhair was exceptional in his communication and responsiveness, as well as his generosity in making sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. Definitely a top notch host in a very nice setting. Only thing to be aware of is that you can hear some noise from the highway across the river but, after a while, it really just became white noise. Sleeping itself was very quiet and comfortable. Kitchen was well-appointed and ambiance inside the cottage was perfect for the setting and very clean. All in all, a fantastic stay! Thank you, Zuhair!"

It is very conveniently located for Six Flags, Springfield and the Forest Zoo (all less than 10 mins drive away). The Riverside Pub (15 min walk) is a pleasant local bar with outdoor seating. We also enjoyed a really excellent Korean meal at Yori restaurant (5 min drive).
Thank you Zuhair!"

Zuhair is a fantastic host and we appreciated his proactive approach and communication. The house was perfect for our group of 3 and it is well stocked with everything you would need for a short or longer stay like ours. Everything in the house is new, clean and well decorated and it was so nice to sit on the porch for morning coffee looking at the river. Highly recommend for anyone hoping for a home away from home experience!"

Stayed a few nights","Where to start on this one.. from the absolute moment we found this place, kind of last minute, Zuhair was EXTREMELY accommodating for our travels from the eastern shore of MD. He does have a no pets policy, but was willing to work with us and our two small labs to help alleviate us spending hundreds more, further away from our destination, and being singled out. He made an exception for us and really went out of his way to make our stay unique and special. He even let us check in early so we could make the tournament on time!!! When I say this home was perfect?! It was perfect! The views from the upper porch, down to the waterfront deck were breath taking!!! Zuhair was right at my fingertips anytime I had a question, or just needed to know where the best recommendations were! With him being a local himself it was easy for him to steer us in the right direction. He supplied everything for us, even toiletries!! The coffee bar was amazing… just all around 10000000 stars!!!!"

Stayed with kids","My family of 4 thoroughly enjoyed a relaxing weekend at Zuhair's lake house. It was tastefully renovated and of a quality like you'd find in someone's own home. Fun amenities included a motorized adjustable bed that my kids dubbed ""the sandwich bed"", Nespresso machine, a gas fire pit and even toothbrush kits in case you forgot yours. The house was tastefully decorated and comfortable to cook, eat, and lounge around in all day.
Zuhair was friendly, communicative and responsive from booking through check in, offering advice on traffic and local grocery stores. We got locked out once and he was able to remotely reset the door code in no time.
The outside deck area was great for BBQ and lounging. There's a great paved path that runs along the river which leads straight to the house, perfect for running or biking. Oh, and there are games - giant Jenga! We had a blast and would definitely stay again."

There isn’t a dishwasher but it was no big deal for us. Joel is a good communicator and I felt comfortable to ask for help if I needed it. He keeps the house nicely landscaped and there is a driveway for off street parking which is really convenient. The back garden has a grill and nice seating area. Bedrooms are small-ish with comfy beds. It was everything we needed to call home for a 3 week working trip.

I don’t know where to start, the Welcome card, fresh flowers, decor, furnishings, sofa bed, linens, private bathroom, toiletries, amenities, coffee, snacks, just WOW…Heather went over and beyond and provided everything!!! And when I say everything…EVERYTHING. She kept close contact, ensured my first night went well including each additional nights; she responded quickly. She extended the use of her car garage that was greatly appreciated with the 24-hour snowstorm we had. That sofa bed, I swear it swallowed me & rocked me to a deep sleep. It was like Heaven’s luxury studio, I am not kidding. Her home is located on a busy through street but it was quiet, peaceful, and in a safe neighborhood. I will definitely return & highly recommend for a getaway. Thank you Heather for your BEAUTIFUL HOME inside & out. I didn’t want to leave, I loved taking photos of inside looking out the big windows, natural warmth & lighting."

Upon entering the space you feel like you’re walking into your own home. Calm, clean and serene…every detail has been thought about when preparing the space. The bathroom is immaculate and spacious for a suite. Small kitchenette area set up with a fridge loaded with waters, dishes, utensils and all the necessary items to help assist with the basics. Pullout couch/bed was super comfortable with the added bonus of amazing linens! Heather put a lot of careful thought into the “little” things which as a renter means ALOT! The space was quiet and peaceful. Cozy evenings set a mood when you light the candles, turn on the fireplace lights, close the blackout drapes and snuggle in for a respite from reality. With easy access to conveniences such as Dunkin Donuts, Big Y, Gas, CVS or experience the charm of Wilbraham at Rices. You are minutes away from everything."

It’s one of those places where I wish that he would rent it out for a reasonable price with housing. Market is so insane right now. Mark was an extremely accommodating host. The place was just as pictured the loft was a nice touch, and the best thing about it was I extended my stay And I had some unforeseen issues arise, which prevented me from checking out on time. In fact, I.L late checking out due to a family emergency, coupled with my own physical limitations due to my physical disability. Mark was super understanding and also very patient and he didn’t need to be at all if it was me knowing that I had company coming in I would’ve been a little bit more pushy to say the very least. He is patient and he was kind and he showed methat when I needed it, the most his place is quiet, clean, and a nice place for a couple or if you yourself want some time to recoup. A+"

Stayed a few nights","Marc’s place was tastefully decorated, the lighting was exquisite especially the living room chandelier! The loft was a neat addition as well and Marc communicated with us better and faster than any other host. The space was roomy the bed comfy especially the down comforter and The bathroom was also nicely decorated. We had a good stay but I was not happy being charged such an exorbitant cleaning fee when there were several bugs in the bedroom. But that’s to be expected this time of yr. Marc waived what WOULD have been the 2nd fee when we had to extend our stay. Overall Id come back. Marc and his wife are great hosts.
Pros: great host, good communication, fast response, stylish, good for a romantic getaway, lots of extras, close to city, flexible check in.
Cons: shower had warm water for @ 6 mins, directly abuts hosts home=little privacy,
(fyi several chickens on property and a rooster whos up @ 330am DAILY. )
Loft beds are just wooden so they could be uncomfortable. Kitchen dirty"

Stayed a few nights","This little cottage is very sweet and cozy with lots of great amenities: a big, cozy bed with lots of extra blankets, hot/strong shower, gas fireplace, gas stove, small but well-equipped kitchen, living room with big window, little sweet elevated nook area (great for reading, might be a bit hard of a surface for sleeping). The only thing to note is that it's very close to the main house and the windows look onto the hosts' front/backyard so if you're keen on privacy you'll want to draw the blinds often. It's also close to a somewhat busy road, but the noise did not bother. I recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","Very cute place. Marc responded quickly with good dinner recommendations so we could make reservations on a busy Valentine's Day. The only issue we had was partly our own mistake. It was very cold when we got there. We figured out how to turn the heat up on the split just inside the door but it never got very warm. After 2 nights we realized there was another thermostat. Once we turned that up, all was good. We probably should have messaged Marc, but it would also have been helpful to have had instructions on how to adjust the temperature."

The cottage is on the hosts property and very close to the main house, which is occupied by the host and his family. We were out exploring the area during the daytime, and didn’t have any interaction with Marc or his family while we were there. It snowed during our stay so Marc shoveled for us, and told us not to rush out in our checkout day."

Stayed a few nights","Beautifully redone old New England cottage with wide hardwood floors and modern heating and bathroom. Lots of space for my husband and I with a living room, bedroom, kitchen, bathroom and really cute loft. The loft would be tons of fun for kids age 4 and up to stay, and is very separate from where the main bedroom is. Chickens and a rooster in the back yard added to the New England farm feel. The house was very sound proof. If the rooster welcomed the morning, we never heard him. I loved the built in wooden table in the living room and bathroom. I would definitely stay there again."

(Before we checked out, we CHECKED the brand of the mattress. We're ordering one this weekend!) REST: MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! Another reviewer mentioned road noise. In 4 days, we may have HEARD 4 cars? It was NOT an issue. If you plan to cook and are VERY tall, this might not be the house for you. The house is clean and bright, immaculate and old (which made me happy. We had fun trying to decide whether it was formerly a carriage house or a chicken coop, or something else.) There is one thing and I feel lame mentioning it. There are 2 TINY steps up to the master bedroom (3 inches high?) and I hate to mention it but when you have knees as bad as mine, those 2 steps first thing in the morning, we'll put it this way, I noticed them, my husband didn't. LOVED THE HOUSE, loved the town. Excellent coffee at Rices Fruit farm. Look forward to another visit!"

I think anytime that you’re staying in a place and wondering how you could replicate the look and feel in your own house, they have done an excellent job! Woodwork was beautiful, bed (and linens) were extremely comfortable. My son loved hanging out in the loft upstairs and it was great to light the fireplace at night. This space was the perfect quiet respite while we were up visiting family. Marc was really kind, friendly and responsive and the space was neat and clean. Also loved the string lights outside that would be on when we came back at night- both helped us easily find the house and made it feel like we were really coming “home”, even if it was a temporary one.

The cottage is a little closer to the main house than I realized but the way the windows are situated you don't really notice. There's a separate driveway for you to park in. The front porch seems like it would be a very nice spot during the warmer months.

Wonderful choices, all around, like old-time Springfield redone by a woodworker -- who clearly added his own furniture pieces. Cozy rooms, hand-crafted wood platform bed, chairs, et al. Simply lovely, and a perfect location for us. Marc, the host, was -- and I do need to online this here, because it's so under-rated as what I think of as the core of service -- simply responsive and welcoming. Much appreciation, Marc. Hope to stay in your space again sometime. So sorry we didn't get a chance to say hello in person."

While we did not need the kitchen this trip, do not be fooled by its size - our hosts have managed to stock it with all you would need to whip up any meal! Lovely rain shower, comfy bed, great sofa and easy to use TV options. Beautiful area. Rice's Fruit Farm, just a short drive away, is great for breakfast sandwiches, baked goods, lunch, early supper and great ice cream and coffee. Just a terrific tiny house with beautiful style."

Stayed with a pet","We were in the area for my daughter's graduation from Western New England University. This cottage was only about 4 miles from the school. It was very clean and well kept cottage with a nice private driveway to park off of the street. Luckily it came with a window air conditioner and fans which kept things pleasant with the heat wave that was there at the time. Breakfasts choices were easy with The Village Cafe being within a 5 minutes walk down the street, or a short 10 minute drive to the Rice Fruit Farm. Also had pizza at Pafumi's To Go, another short walk down the street. We finished up with a trip to the Yankee Candle Village in Deerfield. We loved the stay in the cottage and would definitely recommend it for anyone visiting the area."

Our 7-yo son loved staying in the loft, and our dogs liked looking out the floor to ceiling window in the front. The place is very clean with modern yet cozy decor. All of the host tour guide spots were great. Marc was a responsive and friendly host with whom we enjoyed chatting as well.

Stayed a few nights","Look no further, this is the cozy and beautiful place you’re looking for! Marc’s place was absolutely spotlessly clean, and with zero musty smell (not that I expected it, but I personally hate that). Picture the cutest, most charming cottage, combined with the stylish, cozy charm of every tiny house you’ve seen and you have Marc’s place! We enjoyed two very cozy nights in late October. Upon check-in (which was smooth and simple) we were greeted with a fire in the fire pit, such a lovely touch for a beautiful fall evening. We ordered a delicious Pizza from about 5 min away and enjoyed it by the fire. The bed was very comfortable and each night we slept about 9 hours (we’re both bad sleepers, so that was INCREDIBLE!). The kitchen is small but we made a delicious dinner our second night and had everything we needed. All of the decor and woodwork in the cottage is so peaceful and beautiful. The cottage is located behind Marc’s house, but we felt like we had complete privacy. The rain shower was also fabulous after a rainy day zip lining at Berkshire’s East (SO FUN!). The cottage warmed up super fast as well, but there were also fans in each room, which we really appreciated. We will without a doubt be back (the next time we need good sleep!). Thanks so much Marc!"

Stayed one night","We enjoyed our stay at Donna's. She was very responsive when messaging before our check-in, and we were able to meet her (and her husband in passing) upon our arrival. Donna's place was just what we needed for a nearby trip to Springfield. It's a very convenient location, only about a 10-12 minute drive to the MGM Springfield. We appreciated the amenities, adjustable thermostat, snacks/water available, and the privacy, despite being under their main residence. There is a dirt path next to the house that leads to the parking area that you drive down, it was no issue for us but would recommend reaching out to Donna if you are traveling in inclement weather in case that is a concern. We appreciated the friendliness and comfortable vibe and we would definitely stay again in the future."

Everything was clean, and outfitted with all the amenities listed as well as a few nice touches like snacks and waters.
Donna is a delight! She met me when I arrived to ensure check in went smoothly. I asked for some local recommendations which she was happy to provide and informed me that the same information was on an adorable chalkboard inside. I had an exceptionally pleasant time and will certainly look to stay there again the next time I find myself in the area!"

The location to Robinson State Park is perfect. I went for a few trail runs. It’s quiet and serene. I’m a songwriter and had such a great reset while I was there, that I started writing a song during my stay. I finished it by the end of my vacation.

Stayed one night","A lovely ""in-law apartment, downstairs with seperate coded entrance in the rear of the house in a very quiet residential neighborhood, public park/ball fields down the way, great place to take a walk and quite centrally located to the BigE, Springfield Cassino, Basketball Hall of Fame, and Westfield, which was the main reason for selecting this location. Has a little kitchen with minifridge, toaster, microwave, Kurege Coffee Machine (with a selection of roasts), a basket of snacks and plates, bowls (for cereal?), mugs and glasses provided plus flatware. soft carpet, sofa and generous sized bed with very large flat screen tv with Netflix access plus good WiFi service. Helpful hints and notes throughout the place. Two caveats - Fnding the side unpaved drive/path down the hill at night to the back door, which is tricky. Although Donna was very quick in responding to all communications, they all go through the Airbnb app, which if you are not quick or comfortable doing with a mobile / smart phone, they can potentially lead to frustration, not the fault of the hostess. Very satisfied Airbnb travelers."

Stayed a few nights","Comfortable, clean and quiet. My friend and I both loved the beds, soft pillows and fresh linens. Very nice sitting area for watching tv or just chatting. If you want, you can really cook a meal. The kitchen has mixer, crockpot, pans, all the essentials. There's a keurig coffee maker. I appreciated the attention to detail and the small ways Charmaine makes the apartment feel like home. The bathroom has a great shower. The apartment is in an ideal location, and comes with a parking spot. I would just point out, though, that it is on the 3rd floor walkup, so maybe a little tough if you have mobility issues."

Stayed a few nights","Charmaine's place was exactly what I needed-a quiet and affordable place to stay while I attended a work conference. The layout of the space was perfect for me to eat, relax, & grt a bit of work done before turning in. It was an easy walk to the hotel conference center where the event was, & I passed Nadims (a good local restaurant) on the way... others might enjoy the closeness of the casino & its events as well, & if I hadn't been working so hard it would have been a nice place for a run as well.
Charmaine was a great communicator, sending me all the information I needed when I needed it, which was perfect since I was extremely busy with work. I didn't have time to cook, but while I prepared my breakfast each morning I noticed that the kitchen was well-stocked with cooking utensils and appliances- as a tea drinker I really appreciated the nice kettle!"

The unit was spacious and has a little roku tv, so I was able to sign into my accounts and enjoy my shows prior to bed. Made me feel like home. The shower is PERFECT! You don’t often get both pressure and heat… this shower was remarkable. Private off street parking was a big win."

Stayed a few nights","Alyssa's place was SPOTLESS, and I look everywhere in every corner, even the bottom of the garbage cans were spotless. That's what I need to feel relaxed and her fee was very reasonable for her lovely large place.
EXTREMELY comfortable bed and cooling bed sheets. She even left a snack basket out for us, water bottles and water filter pitcher in the larger-than-usual compact refrigerator.
We normally stay in either Northampton or Amherst areas but we found that this location in Springfield was just as close or closer and was much easier to zip back and forth to Mt. Holyoke College for events we were attending.
Although we never physically met each other, she was always responsive, friendly and courteous. Would stay there again most certainly and I really recommend this place."

Just note that you'll need to walk outside through the grass to get to and from your car and the room - so if you're going out or wearing nice clothes/shoes you may want to keep that in mind. Also, be sure to bring slippers to wear inside to honor the host's ""no shoes"" request. Great stay, and Alyssa was so helpful. She brought down a steamer for me so I could get the ""travel wrinkles"" out of a dress shirt - immediate response, and very accommodating. Great host! And yes, we occasionally heard the sounds of playing above us, but it was not at all disturbing to us, and I wouldn't let that discourage anyone from staying here."

Folks with mobility issues might have a bit of difficulty, but otherwise it is a short walk down a slight hill, with a set of lit stairs, to the back. The setting is a typical suburban neighborhood in Springfield with lots of families. I came to spend the Christmas holiday with my family and I can say that coming back to the Airbnb at the end of the day was a welcome respite."

Stayed a few nights",Alyssa was very kind and the listing is just as beautiful in person as it is in the pictures. My only complaint is as a 238lb woman. The shower head is really close to the shower wall which doesn’t allow for much scrubbing room. I was still able to do everything I needed as the shower head is removable. The place was the perfect size for 2 adults and our 1 year old. We made her a blanket bed on the floor and it was honestly softer than the bassinet she slept in as a newborn. We highly recommend this place and would love to stay here again if we travel back to Massachusetts in the future!

The bed was so comfortable and the bathroom has a spa feel with such wonderful touches. The weather was extremely hot and humid while I was there, but the air conditioner worked so well and was EXTREMELY quiet, so I was beyond comfortable. They have thought of everything, including everything you need to make meals, with a grocery store nearby. The neighborhood is safe and friendly with parking right out front. On the last day, I locked my keys in my trunk. They came out with tools and helped me, even after AAA said there was no way to get them. I stay in many Airbnb's, but this one is at the top of my list. I can't wait to visit again!"

Alyssa was quick to respond with any questions and gave privacy during the stay as well. It snowed quite a bit during the time there and Alyssa kept the driveway cleared out as well as a path shoveled to the entrance. Accommodations were clean and comfortable which made work travel a breeze. Many thanks!

Disclaimer: If you’re tall (>6 feet/183cm) then you will find yourself needing to duck through entryways and the showerhead will feel low for you.
It was a wonderful, calm experience and I hope to stay there again."

Stayed a few nights","Thank You for allowing us to stay in your home. We found the space, very well for the value paid. I enjoyed the coffee and nice hot showers. The peace and quiet was very nice as well. Being across from the Big E is a huge Plus. Unfortunately, I felt the host could give more accurate descriptions of the home setting. The ceilings in the home were 5’8” or so. Which makes it hard for a 5’11” guy like my husband. I also feel the host could be more responsive.
It was okay other than that.
I’d book here again. No Major Issues."

The temperature was warm and toasty on the coldest day of the year. There is parking in the back and not requiring you to park on the street. There are several restaurants nearby too. It’s great for the price!"

But for the rest of us short people it was great! You can hear some light foot traffic above you but it didn’t bother us and was a wonderful experience near the Big E!
Though the parking was a little rough if you have a larger vehicle (truck or suburban) but a car or suv would have been no issue! We managed just fine with our issue!"

Stayed one night",I loved this place. Me and my boyfriend wanted to go to the Big E For the first time and we live two hours away and also wanted to check out the MGM casino so we thought it would be cool to stay over for a night. He found this place very quickly and it seemed perfect especially the price! The place was very clean and seemed to have everything you need for a night stay or even more! It was fully stocked with paper towels and toilet papers. She even had Qtips in the bathroom and shampoo and conditioner in the shower! It smelt great in the place and seriously was so clean. It was very spacious for a basement apartment. We thought we had saw it said a 5 min walk in the description which it turned out to be 17 but we might have misread that. Also one thing to notice the bed seemed to be lopsided and it turns out two of the pegs on the bed frame were either missing or broken! I just wanted to point this out for the host and the customers sake! It was still amazin! Thanks irine :)

Stayed one night","Iryna's basement apartment was an absolute gem! From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with ease and convenience. The fact that we could arrive in the evening without any hassle of getting into the space was a huge plus for us.
Parking just a few feet away from the door in a private lot was such a convenience, especially after a long day of exploring. It gave us peace of mind knowing our vehicle was safe and easily accessible.
The cleanliness of the bathroom was top-notch, and we were pleasantly surprised by the hot water with good pressure in the shower. It's those little details that truly make a difference in the overall comfort of a stay.
Overall, our experience at Iryna's basement apartment was outstanding. It's evident that the host pays attention to every detail to ensure a comfortable and enjoyable stay. We highly recommend this cozy space to anyone looking for a home away from home."

It is definitely a basement with the sounds and cooking of upstairs part of life. Ceilings are 6 for max with some ducking needed at times. It worked well for a night option that felt safe while on a roadtrip."

Stayed one night","I would highly recommend Iryna's place. It costs almost half when compared to other locations. In fact, it's such a great offer that it seems to be full most of the time. It is a very nice, finished basement that remains very well ventilated and cooled, so the guests should not find any bugs. The place is located in a safe, suburban New Englamnd neighborhood. It is basically a one-bedroom apartment for the guests while Iryna lives upstairs. It is a short drive to a plaza and liquor store, very near to several colleges. The price was great and host was sweet. I hope to visit this place in the future. She was so nice that I left my apartment spotlessly clean since I'm a superhost myself and felt like I should help such a sweet lady. Best wishes to her."

Pros:
-cost savings for a private space was unbeatable.
- ac kept me cool on the 90F day
- easy check in
Cons;
- loud hearing people walk up stairs—multistory unit and this unit is in the basement.
- Didn’t see a lock on the door that led from the basement space to the rest of the home (didn’t feel secure and since people were easily heard walking upstairs & there were moments I was unsure if someone was walking down to the unit or not—they weren’t but it’s sounded like it)
- loud AC
- curtain for a door that separated the basement space from the room"

Stayed a few nights","The space was as described in the listing. It does have low ceilings and a steep staircase without a railing. The bed was uncomfortable…too firm for my taste and sloped to the right. I never really heard voices or much sound, but I was awoken every night by someone walking above between 2 and 4 AM. I did not get a good nights sleep any of the days I stayed. The rugs and shower curtain smelled of mildew and needed to be washed. While the room is separate from the rest of the house, and I never felt like I would be intruded upon, there is no door or way to secure the basement apartment from the rest of the home. All in all, you get what you pay for, and the rate was very reasonable for what was provided."

Stayed a few nights","Like quite a few posts said: This Airbnb is a great place to stay for a night or two with just about everything one needs. It was very clean and nicely decorated. I would consider it semi-private due to the curtain separating the host’s space and the Airbnb space. You have to go through the curtain to get to the bathroom. The bed linens were wonderful. The ad says mini kitchen and the pictures only show the fridge wall and table wall. The other wall has a small toaster oven – no potholders. There was bottled water and creamer in the fridge. As other guests have said, the ceilings are a tad bit low, which might be a challenge if you don’t know how to duck. I lived in a basement apartment, so I’m used to hearing a heat system kick on and upstairs tenant noise, so it wasn’t too big of a deal for me. It's a great location if you're going to the Big E or something downtown around Memorial Bridge. I had a good stay. Thank you!"

Stayed one night",The place was clean and there was a bathroom but the separator between the bedroom and the rest of the house was a curtain which made the experience less comfortable as it was not shown that way in the booking pictures. It functioned as a place to stop but even as someone 5’7 I had to be concerned about hitting my head walking to the bathroom.

Stayed one night","The apartment is a great place to stay for a night or two with everything one needs. It's cozy, clean and spacious for two. I especially appreciated the private and very clean bathroom and separate kitchen. There is no full stove, but there is an excellent high end toaster oven for toasting and even baking and broiling, etc. The coffee maker is a Keurig, but there is an electric kettle to heat water if one prefers coffee by other means. As was pointed out by another guest, the ceilings are a tad bit low which might be a challenge for unusually tall folks. I had a good stay and would stay there again. Thank you!"

Stayed a few nights","NOT IMPRESSED! I stayed here for the Fiber Festival at the Big E for 2 nights. She told me to self-check in. I had no clue if it was street parking or if there was a specific area to park; we parked out back. Yes, the listing read private entrance, but the basement is shared with host, though she never came down. The listing omits there is a toaster oven with no oven mitt, the coffee maker is a Keurig, the sugar in held in a dirty cup, there were two open containers in the fridge - half & half and almond milk, you could constantly hear EVERY footstep upstairs all night long, draws and cupboards opening and closing, she yelled at her cats, you can hear the cat's meow and hiss, she vacuumed at 10:45pm, silverware are plastic and plates are paper - there is no cutlery, eaten bag of Chips-a-hoy under the sink, both shampoo bottles were empty. There is no thermostat to control the heat so first night was a dang sauna!! I messaged host but never got a response so second night was also freak'n hot! I did not get a wink of sleep for my much-needed show."

We never received any check in instructions, just found it unlocked with the keys."

Stayed one night","This place is great for what you pay, location to the big E is amazing, parking is private, out back and easy! Same complaints as others on here, the ceilings are pretty low so you may have to duck if you are tall, I’m only 5’8” and had to duck in a couple places. The space isn’t really “private” as there is only a curtain hanging in the doorway next to the bed, that leads to a shared hallway, washer and dryer, bathroom and staircase that leads to the upper level of the house. Being in the basement you can hear the noise of people walking, talking ect above you, we could hear those above us till close to midnight, but again it’s a basement so understandable. Communication was a little difficult and even non existent on the day of check in on. Overall the place is clean, bigger than anticipated and in an unbeatable location for the fairgrounds! We are easy going so none of this actually bothered us, just info for others to use while booking!"

Stayed a few nights","This was a convenient and nice place to stay while In The Springfield area. Having a full fridge helped with having some of our own drinks and food y leftovers . It was clean , bed was comfy and although in the basement it was spacious and comfortable. Not sure why some reviews said it wasn’t private . Whole basement is private. Host lives upstairs and there is a basement door she uses I assume to come down but she never did while we were there . Bathroom is not shared. Basement stairs are a bit steep and doesn’t have a railing so if some one has some mobility issues , it may be difficult for them to get down them. But we would stay here again. It was definitely convenient for the big e as we walked there. It’s about a 10 minute walk ."

Stayed one night","Nice little apartment, firm comfortable bed, quite private. Very Nice laundry machines (you pay a bit extra). While this place might be best for travelers with cars, from the point of view of someone who arrived with Lyft, the neighborhood really shuts down at night. One could order food for delivery (there are some brochures). However, in the morning there is a quite nice place about a five minute walk away called Memo's. Very local and relaxing, good light muffins (three berry is particularly good) and not awful coffee. Also I was able to walk over the bridge to the bus at MCM Casino, it was pleasant. Perhaps West Springfield has much more going on on weekdays. Also, the small historic area near Symphony Hall is worth a look, and on other trips, I have enjoyed the museums here."

Upon arrival, we were pleasantly surprised! The space was much larger and cleaner than the pictures showed. We were all impressed – the price was definitely worth it. Everything, from the bathrooms and kitchen to each room, was very clean. It was a perfect short stay for a large group. If you're looking for a spacious and clean place near Amherst College, I highly recommend checking this rental option out!"

We stayed for three nights over our son’s graduation weekend from a local college and appreciated it every step of the way. The house itself is stunning with original woodwork. There are 6 bedrooms to choose from, all unique, all with comfortable beds. The upstairs bathroom has a clawfoot tub which, though I never had a chance to use, is just beautiful. The Air BnB is equipped with every possible thing you could need and the full kitchen even offers a fridge stocked with water and juice, an adorable coffee bar, and snacks. Salomi has thought of everything. We were especially grateful because Salomi allowed us to have a gathering of family and friends at the house after the graduation ceremony. The back yard and deck were the perfect setting for a truly special time that we will remember forever. This house is a gem and Salomi is the ultimate host. I can’t wait to go back!"

Stayed with a pet","Very clean and nice place to stay. The backyard was nice for our dogs. We were at a dog show so we were gone all day and to have a yard to let the dogs run around in early morning and late evening after our show was helpful. Upon booking it was not clear that the charge was per bedroom/number of guests. After booking when I added my housemates for the weekend to the guest list I was surprised at how much of a price increase. One of our friends was not able to attend so there was only 2 of us at the price of 3 bedrooms which was a little disappointing. Overall it was a nice stay though we were only there to sleep at night, gone all day. We hope to re-book in the future."

Easy to find, lots of parking, and the snacks and drinks available in the house were definitely a plus that we appreciated after a long night of dancing.
Only issue we had was with some of the cleanliness and clutter, with some trash left behind in a few of the bedroom trash cans when we arrived and a few miscellaneous items in the bedroom closets and dressers. Otherwise, was a great stay! If you have a large group (we had 6) staying in Springfield you should definitely consider this place!"

The bedrooms were comfy and well appointed. There were two full bathrooms which is great for larger families. We were about 15 minutes from Six Flags which was our destination so that was perfect. We had to drive a little find a breakfast spot but that was no problem. There was a full kitchen and dishwasher so if we planned better we could have cooked or grabbed something from the supermarket. We would definitely stay again due to the size and comfort of the place.

Only 10 minutes from Western New England University, where we were visiting our son and a mere 5 minutes from the downtown area. We visited the Basketball Hall of fame and the Dr. Seuss museum. Salomi is a great host, always instant with a reply. We wish her the best with this new project."

We stayed here during the Arctic Chill weekend when it dropped to negative temps with -40 degree windchills and the bedrooms were heated spectacularly -- if you've ever owned an old home, you know this is a feat (and that snuggling into a nice toasty bedroom is a great end to a long, bone-chilling day). There was more than enough room for us, which was a welcome change - we even had our pick of bedrooms, what a luxury!"

KP was quite the hostess and hospitable beyond expectation.
The common areas are quite the experience— the silver room hosts the best sunsets over the city skyline and disappears behind the mountains. But I like to be hot so I spent most of my time outside on the veranda. I’m in love. The brown “receiving” room is my favorite room, perfect if you like to sit and read or if you just want to beat your significant other at a mean game of scrabble, connect four or any of the other board games offered in the house.
If you’re hesitant about staying here, just book it!"
