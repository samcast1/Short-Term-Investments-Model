Stayed a few nights","This cabin exceeded expectations. Everything is exactly as described. The entire place was pristine in cleanliness. We've stayed in several cabins in TN & MO and the setup of Kerri's hot tub & the hot tub itself is by far the best we've experienced. Kerri is an incredible host as well. So responsive & kind. Secluded is very true & that was so nice. We will definitely stay here again. It is certainly family friendly & kids would love it, but is perfection for a couple's get away. Every positive review is true. We're so happy to have found this location."

Stayed a few nights","We absolutely loved this space! Right on the river, woods and ground to explore and very private. I wasn't expecting the taxidermy but it was all tastefully done if you like that sort of thing. The hot tub and fireplace almost felt treehouse like, and the wrap porch had a beautiful veiw of the water and wild life. It was exactly the peaceful weekend getaway we where looking for."

Stayed a few nights","Beautiful setting, peaceful, clean, private, everything you could ask for on a weekend getaway. Cabin has everything you need in the kitchen to cook with including seasonings and cooking oils. Could use some grilling utensils or we just couldn't find them. The river is beautiful, current is strong so be careful when getting in. Hot tub building is amazing, as is the outside fireplace. Do use bug repellent, as the one day I didn't, the chiggers found me, my bad. Was a perfect weekend to celebrate my wife's birthday. Thank you Kerri for sharing your beautiful cabin with us. We look forward to coming back.

Stayed a few nights","We stayed at Kerri’s cabin for our first getaway as a couple after having our baby last fall. It was such a great experience! We brought our own canoe to use on the river. The current was strong so beware, but we were still able to paddle upstream a ways, swim at a beach, and then float home. The Airbnb itself was cozy and clean. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook, the porch was great. The stairs upstairs were steep, so watch your step. We loved the side cabin with the hot tub too. The space was very private as well with only occasional motor boats going by.
We would love to come back again some day!"

Stayed about a week","Heaven on earth exists here! My Husband & I stayed for 8 days. Every day we saw something new! The wildlife is priceless! Seeing deer, turkeys & so much more was the coolest thing! The windows in the cabin give you so many views it’s impossible to sit around! The Cabin is gorgeous! We felt right at home! Everything was so clean including the amazing hot tub! Every detail has been thought of and executed perfectly! This is hands down the best experience ever! There is not a single thing to complain about! My favorite part were the tiny tree frogs. The night sky is so bright at night. Plenty of shade when it’s sunny and the river is remarkably clean. There are trails to walk and lots of nature to experience! This was Our Dream vacation and because of Kerri, it came true! We will definitely be booking again! You won’t be disappointed with this property!"

The only thing I would say I was not fond of was there was no privacy in the bedrooms upstairs. There was a curtain on one side, but no walls to separate the bedrooms or a door. We would definitely stay again though. I highly recommend if you are an outdoor lover for sure!"

Stayed with kids","This cabin in the woods is perfect! The cabin is decorated with a rustic, outdoorsman theme. It was clean and had everything we needed to make meals at the cabin. The hot tub area is unique and perfect for relaxing even if not using the hot tub. It’s secluded and right on the Black River. With the trail, river, fire pit, and open area, there is plenty to enjoy the outdoors. We loved this cabin and enjoyed getting away with our family. It makes me want to purchase a cabin for my own family. We hope to come back!"

The log cabin in the middle of the woods that backed up to the river was exactly what we were looking for. Oh, did I mention the hot tub was the most relaxing part of the whole trip. Thank you again for sharing your beautiful hidden jem with our family."

Stayed with kids",I would 100% recommend this cabin! the pictures does not do it justice! I knew the outside was going to be beautiful but I didn't realize how secluded and how much space there really was. Also the inside was far nicer than I expected! the small bridge between the bedrooms was so cute and different. The whole place was incredibly clean and the host took pride in making sure everything was up to par. We unfortunately had car troubles before we left but she helped us find a good mechanic and even offered to bring us what we needed since we were stranded for a bit. Me and my husband spent alot of time fishing and cooling off in the river. Everything was perfect and I wouldn't change a thing about the place if I could! My family hopes to come back next year in the spring or fall to experience the place in a different season!

Stayed a few nights","The place is very peaceful. Very beautiful getaway! Mosquitoes are pretty bad but nothing can be done about that when your by the river just make sure to have bug spray! They do have candles that help and had bug spray. The only other thing to watch for would be if you are coming out of the hot tub room with DRY feet be careful you will slide without warning! Other than that coffee, dishes, condiments, seasonings, candy, clean comfy beds, tv, washer and dryer all a plus. Was already cool inside when we got there. There was a deer on the trail we got to see as well!"

Stayed one night","This cabin is a huntsman paradise! Even though mounted animals and camo printed linens aren't for me, it was incredibly comfortable! Out of nowhere, down a winding dirt road emerges a small piece of heaven! 10/10 hands down the nicest and most memorable place you could possibly stay when visiting Poplar Bluff!
Bad weather left me unable to get the full experience, but the refuge and relaxation provided via the separated hot tub building was some of the very best in my life thus far, no question!"

Stayed a few nights","We loved staying at this cabin!! It was definitely a glamping experience with the fire out front and river access. Talk about a secluded retreat! No other property is even within view and is a short drive from the main road outside of a closed gate. If it was any cooler we would have loved to take advantage of the hot tub and gas fireplace inside the additional structure but we didn't use it, being so hot outside in July. Many little details were thought of and provided such as games, life preservers, additional seating and fans for the upstairs loft area. Excellent stay and would highly recommend!"

Truth is, it doesn't get better than this! It was thoroughly clean, relaxing, right by the river, and all the amenities you could hope for. Kerri was very kind and communicative, and the property is simple breath-taking. If you're looking for ultimate romance, this is the place. If you're looking for a place to hang with the girls for the weekend, also the place! The beds are comfortable, the hot tub addition is amazing, and it's close to town if you've forgotten anything.

Stayed a few nights","Awesome place! The house and tree house hottub area is amazing! The river access is just right there in the yard. We found out that you can do a little float trip, it will take about 3ish hours and you stop at Hillard Bridge. We had 2 cars and parked one at the bridge so when were done we just drove home which took about 7 minutes.
Couple of things to note, the 2 bedrooms do not have doors and are just up in a loft area. Also meaning that if you are downstairs you can see and hear into the room areas. Even though the bedrooms are not ideal it was still a great cabin and experience! Kerri was quick to respond and helpful with questions."

The screened in hot tub room is such a retreat and I love that it's separate from the main house. Everyone loved the rope bridge too. The river is beautiful and makes it everything so serene. We walked the trail and enjoyed seeing lots of deer in the field near the cabin. We can't wait to stay here again on our future trips to the area."

Kerri was great with communication, directions and instructions for check-in. Any older folks or people with disabilities should beware of the stairs to the bedrooms - they are very steep and can be a little tricky to navigate, particularly when carrying luggage, etc. However, don't let that deter you from staying at this great little cabin - the furniture is just as comfy to sleep on!!! :) Overall a wonderful stay! Highly recommended!"

We spent our days floating, fishing, and exploring and our nights were spent sitting by the campfire making s'mores, sitting by the river listening to the wildlife and watching the stars, and relaxing in the hot tub. The decorations are perfect and really make it feel like home away from home. They have everything you could possibly need while staying there. We only left to visit Big Spring and to run to the grocery store. We had a perfect Memorial Day weekend and can't wait to return!"

You just never really know until you get there, and we were blown away when we got there. The privacy was amazing, loved feeling like we were alone in the world out there, and yet it was just a short 10 minute drive into town with anything and everything you would need if you had forgotten anything. It really was the perfect place to relax and disconnect for a bit, even though we did have perfect cell signal while out there which was very surprising. We truly loved every second on our trip and plan on saving this cabin for a future stay. We've already told many of our family and friends how great it was as well."

It was sparkling clean and had everything you’d need for a romantic weekend or a family getaway in a rustic, hunting lodge motif complete with stuffed deer heads and bob cats. The river is just 100 feet away and its cool water is nice, although it’s not as nice as the screened in hot tub. Plenty of wildlife in the area that visit too."

Between the screened in porch, fire pit area, deck, and actual cabin itself, it's easy to find a spot to read or watch a movie and be comfortable no matter the temperature outside. It was in the upper 80's/lower 90's during our stay and the hot tub was still great to use in the mornings and evenings. We enjoyed jumping in the river (life jackets advised) upstream from the cabin and letting the swift current take us back to their boat launch area. A bonus, it's not a super buggy area, with regular application of bug spray we only came away with a couple of bites which I was impressed with. We hope to return again!"

The location is so private. It truly is your space away from the world on the river while you rent it. You may see an occasional fisherman traveling past by boat, but other than that you could dance naked on the wrap around deck if you wanted. We were so grateful to be able to stay again.

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I have stayed at countless airbnbs, vrbos, and the like. We are always looking for hidden gems that are worth a repeat visit. We do our research prior to booking and generally are always satisfied. But, when we arrived at this cabin we knew we had found that gem. The cabin sits directly on the river and offers privacy that very few places afford anymore. The kind of place that doesn’t need curtains or blinds. The wrap around deck is amazing and offers covered and oncovered areas to sit and admire the river directly in front of you. The owners had to have put in countless hours to clear the land around the river to offer such a view while still preserving the beauty of nature that surrounds it. The river is slow enough in front of the cabin so you can take a swim and cool off if you would like. There is a boat launch/public access up river if you wanted to float down to the cabin….that was our original plan, but once we got to the cabin we said to heck with it. The cabin offered all the entertainment we needed….a small zipline, yard games, a walking/ATV trail. The inside of the cabin was immaculate and stylishly decorated. Some people open their home to you, these owners truly OPEN their home to you. I couldn’t believe the things they made available to their guests. They had a large screen TV connected to dish network. We were able to screen our phone to the TV and watch the Cardinals game each evening. Everything was great. I hate to write this review….I wish some things could stay secret, but I owe it to the owners for an awesome weekend. I hope you will have us in the future because we will definitely be requesting a booking again."

Stayed a few nights","Great place
Really comfy
All the supplies for cooking meals are there.
Television is easy to hook up to iPad.
super clean, quiet, senic.
The river was so nice and lots of wildlife from deer when we first pulled in, to tiny field mice, and a frog. like the field mouse and the frog were together it was so cute. An ole owl that hoots right up till the sun comes up. I'm an early bird myself so I was sitting by the river to experiance all this. oh yeah and a beautiful woodpecker. I was one of 4 guests that stayed this weekend and this is my personal review. We all loved it."

I had an issue with a ceiling fan not working and I messaged Lane to give her a heads up and she offered to send someone out asap to fix it. It wasn’t a big deal so I declined but I did appreciate the offer! I had to message her a few times but every time she was responsive & helpful. I would definitely stay here again!"

We were visiting for the Puxico Homecoming. Weekend weather was quite warm, to our dismay there wasn’t an ice maker or trays to make ice! This would have been much appreciate. We did purchase a bag of ice 😏
The linens and beds were wonderful.

Stayed with kids","This house is an amazing find in Poplar Bluff! We've stayed at many places in the area and this one is by far the best. First impressions, the place is so cozy and more importantly very clean. I didn't feel like I was staying in a place other people are in and out of.
In fact, my kid loved the decor in the house so much he wrote in the guest book that he'd like you guys to come decorate our house.
Lane was fantastic to communicate with. The one issue we had was solved so quickly. I also got to visit with her because before the trip she arranged to come by one morning while internet was getting installed and she was a delight.
We hosted a couple family members for a post-Christmas celebration and they all mentioned how nice the space was.
There's two living rooms, which was very ideal for kids. We could get some time away from each other while the chilled in one living room and the adults hung out in another."

We did buy and leave a few kitchen utensils as well as trash bags, paper towels etc. overall it was a great experience just a little short on supplies. We probably could have asked Carla but it was a holiday week and we didn’t want to disturb. This is not a negative review in any way.

Stayed one night","If you’re going to be in the area, book this place without hesitation. All the other reviews are right, this place is a jewel! Our family absolutely loved our visit. It’s a great place to relax and enjoy the sounds of nature at night. The place was immaculately clean and comfortable. The kitchen is only minimally stocked with dishes and glassware, but the kitchen in the main house is available for use if you want to prepare food more complicated then a microwave can handle. The full breakfast provided for us in the morning was a pleasant surprised and very delicious. Every thing you might need has been thought about and the amenities are numerous. We will be back in future. Bring a fishing pole if that’s your thing, as the pond is stocked and is a fun place to drop a line."

Stayed one night","The view of Mirror Lake was incredible. From the time we arrived to the time we left, the hospitality was top notch. When I booked the cabin, I didn’t know it was actually attached to the B&B they ran. When Becky showed us the cabin, she then asked us what we wanted for breakfast, we were caught off guard a little as she gave several options like pancakes, eggs, B&G, etc. She also gave us a few options for supper, but we already had a place in mind (Bread&Butter). When we told her, she agreed that was a good place to eat. If you needed anything, you could texted them, but the place was also private."

Stayed a few nights","The property was as pictured and as described - very pretty, with calming colors and nice decor. Kristin is super responsive.
Bloomfield is a nice little town, and host provided recommendations for dining and other activities. While options in Bloomfield are limited, nearby Dexter has more options. Sikeston is within about 1/2 hour. We enjoyed the nearby town square and all the historical markers. Our reason for staying in Bloomfield was to visit the Stars & Stripes Museum, and for that, this was a perfect location.
Our only issues keeping me from giving it 5 stars are that the housekeeping person didn’t re-stock some items needed (we expected to have toilet paper and coffee for 2 people for 2 nights) and we had to work around a leaking bathroom sink - Kristin offered to call a plumber right away but didn’t want to inconvenience us by making us wait around when we had plans for the day. A stop on both ends of the barn door rail to keep it from sliding off would be helpful."

Stayed a few nights","What a gem in Bloomfield! It looks AND feels like the interior of a Pottery Barn store!!! We were in town for a family wedding. I work remotely and this was the perfect place to work during the week: quiet,swanky, fast & reliable internet, plenty of air conditioning, plenty of workspace, and a large fridge. I got a lot done in our 4-5 days staying there - even my laundry! Kristin was wonderful! She was quick to respond to all of our questions - even BEFORE we made a reservation (and a reservation on short notice at that).
This is a gem and it will certainly be our “go-to” from now on when we visit family in Bloomfield. We highly recommend the stay, it’s worth every penny. Bravo!!

Stayed a few nights","We strongly recommend a thorough cleaning of this house. We had severe allergic reactions while inside the house that noticeably cleared up outside the house. Non-stop sneezing, congestion, itchy eyes, and coughing. The tissue boxes everywhere were a nice touch but made us wonder if this has been a problem in the past. We noticed in the listing that pets are allowed and we are allergic to cats and some dogs. There was a strange smell in the house as if it hadn’t been opened in awhile. The smell of old or musty. The local host did not respond to my follow up email asking whether there were other people staying in the downstairs since there were lights on every night even though we booked the entire place. Quite concerning. The kitchen was also weirdly outfitted. We ended up needing to buy a pot and a spoon or two because there weren’t any. We also couldn’t watch tv because it said that the streaming services were already being used on too many devices, although not by us.
Other than these things, we enjoyed our stay and the property is quite pretty."

We felt very safe in this location.
Beds were super comfortable and we had a very restful sleep. Would definitely recommend as very fairly priced."

The outside of the house was fairly run down. The lock was very hard to use, both locking and unlocking.
The neighborhood was really rough: abandoned, boarded up house next door and several houses that were kind of scary. We were three ladies and when we were by ourselves we felt a little unsafe- even though nothing happened.
However, the price reflects this and I think for the cost it was a good deal. I would have wanted to know about the neighborhood before we reserved- that is why I am sharing that."

Every detail, from the well-stocked bookshelves to the assortment of games and amenities, contributed to a memorable and enjoyable experience. The double bunk beds were a hit with the kids, and the sun porch provided the perfect spot for relaxation.

The screened in porch was easily our favorite part of the cabin, but we also greatly appreciated the seamless access to WiFi and our favorite streaming services! The cabin was quite clean for our stay. We enjoyed the proximity to Wappapello State Park, too. The Allison Day use area was fantastic!
There were a few things beyond the host's control that I would want to know if I booked. These things didn't diminish our stay too much, but are notable. We were not thrilled with the neighborhood. One home had broken junk and trash lined up along the road along their entire property line. The neighbor that you can see from the cabin had a very messy outdoor space within visibility, which kept us off the front deck. We also had an instance where their dogs followed us.
All in all, we enjoyed our time together, and I'm very thankful for the wonderful host that Lauren was!"

The state park is lovely, picturesque, and not crowded; we can't imagine why it's not overrun with folks from St Louis. We did 1 of the hikes which was well maintained until the last half mile, then the waist high grasses covered the trail, tic and chigger heaven.
We are glad we found this cabin and this park; we'll be back!"

The kitchen was well-stocked. The bedrooms were clean and spacious. The bed was a little firm for our preference.
The proximity to Lake Wappapello State Park is great. We went for a hike, enjoyed the beauty of the lake, and spent some time there. Also, it's not too far of a drive to Poplar Bluff, which has some good antique stores, shops, and restaurants.
The biggest bummer was the neighborhood around the cabin. While it's not really the fault of the host, the surrounding neighbors and homes leading up to the cabin are very junky and unkempt. Lots of trailers, trash scattered around, etc. Sort of ruins the vibe."

It is so lived in and cozy - like a hug! We spent lots of time on the screened in porch playing chess and checkers. Our 6 year old son loved chess so much we had to order a set before we even left. Our two year old enjoyed the swing, the hammock, the playdough and so many other toys that Lauren has thoughtfully cultivated. We went hiking, fishing and swimming at Lake Wappapello State Park which is a short drive away and had a really good supper at Crabb & Company. It was wonderful to have uninterrupted time together. I am dreaming of a fall trip with my girls friends to this sweet cabin. It is such a lovely place to just be. If you need a getaway, the Hillside Hideaway is a dream!"

Stayed with kids","I booked a last minute getaway, just to get a change of scenery for my family. This cabin was perfect for us and our two young kids (3, 5). There were toys and games, which were perfectly suited for them and they loved the novelty of playing with something new (rather then the toys we brought). Of course they also loved the bunk beds, screened in porch and outside space (hammock, fire pit). The place was cozy, well-designed and the kitchen was well-stocked. Nice touches included having charcoal for the grill and firewood on hand. If you’re a coffee drinker, there are a few different brewing options as well! Hiking and boating (if you do that) at the lake is about a 10-15 minute drive away (rough guess). If I had any complaints, there isn’t a dishwasher, so it’s just a bit of a bummer to have to spend so much time hand washing during a “getaway”… but also wouldn’t expect one in a cabin like this!
Overall we had a lovely stay and only wish the weather had been warmer so we could’ve spent more time on the porch in the morning and at night."

Stayed with a pet","We had a great little last-minute, long-weekend getaway at this adorable cabin! The drive south to the cabin was easy, peacefully scenic and low in traffic (keep in mind that for maybe an hour on highway 67 approaching the cabin, there is little in the way of food and gas options, so plan accordingly). As others have stated, the cabin is CLEAN and well-stocked with cooking and baking equipment. We brought all of our groceries for the weekend, including a family-sized container of cookie dough, which we used to bake several batches of cookies with the kids. The colorful plastic kids’ dining items helped keep track of whose plate and cup was whose, and we didn’t have to worry about anything breaking. The cabin’s location is nicely secluded. It is not “off-grid” or “dogs can roam off-leash” level secluded, as there are a few homes in the vicinity, but it was definitely rural, woodsy and very quiet. We weren’t quite sure if there were hiking trails within walking distance (we didn’t want to pack everyone up and drive into the state park), so we spent most of our time around the cabin, reading books and playing with the fun games and toys that Lauren provided (the younger kids were entertained all weekend). We also enjoyed swinging on the saucer swing outside, and drinking coffee, playing checkers or reading a book or magazine (Lauren has some interesting reads scattered around the cabin) on the screened porch. Nights were quiet and peaceful, making s’mores at the fire pit and appreciating the stars, then coming back in and gathering around the fireplace- electric is so fast and convenient!!- and watching a movie (streaming and WiFi worked flawlessly for us). Hot water for dishes and bathing was plentiful, and the beds were very comfortable; we all slept uncommonly well. Lauren always communicated extremely quickly and thoroughly. Thanks for a lovely stay!"

Lots of hiking trails close by as well as a great beach to go swimming. Everything we needed to cook our meals was provided as well as common spices. Highly recommended.

Stayed a few nights","We understood there was no internet, we thought we had Ethernet.
We didn’t expect that we would not be able to watch tv at all. We felt misled.
The couch in the living room is the most uncomfortable couch we have ever sat on. The back door needs to be replaced, we were two women and a grandson traveling for the holidays we could see daylight through the door. It made us a little nervous. We planned a two night stay but left after one night."

Stayed one night","The price per night is on par with the place and location. There is a giant sign when you walk in that says the host isn’t responsible for stolen property or damage to vehicles. Which makes me think there have been issues in the past. Thankfully, we didn’t have an issue but every noise outside makes you get up to look out the window. The house is in a gravel parking lot right off the highway where they seem to store construction equipment. As I said the price per night is reasonable. But, the cleaning fee seems a little steep considering the place wasn’t very clean. There were cobwebs in the doorways, mud in the hallway, and hair in the hall bathroom sink. So, I’m not sure where the $100 for cleaning goes… lastly, there is a tv with Roku so you can watch Netflix etc. but, the internet isn’t fast enough to stream anything. So, that seems like a waste. I’m not sure I would stay again."

Stayed a few nights","This property served its purpose. I’ve stayed in many Airbnb and this one was lowest in quality. It’s a trailer which is not in the description. The amenities were sparse and low in quality. One of the bathroom’s shower/tub floor felt like it had a bubble under it. Each time I stepped it popped. Some of the electrical outlets didn’t work. Ants were in the kitchen. I left a glass of water in the kitchen. When I returned , there were ants in my water. For the price I paid for each night compared to the quality of the property, it was definitely not worth it!"

I felt very safe and was less than 10 minutes from food stores, restaurants, etc. Kelly was always responsive when I had questions. When there was a power outage, she sent a message in less than 10 minutes letting me know it was due to maintenance on the lines and would be back on shortly. The condo was clean and uncluttered, yet stocked with items commonly needed in a home. Very handy. I was also very happy it had a carport. I highly recommend Kelly as a host and this condo for a stay."

Living room furniture is showing wear but it works.

Stayed a few nights","Just... wow!! What an amazing space with tons of character! Kimberly has clearly put a lot of time, detail, and care into creating her cabin theme. She created a beautiful mash-up of quaint country and the 70's, with so many details that both make the space more cozy, beautiful, and on theme. I could go on and on about all of the things, but I will try to stick to a few of my favorites. I loved the farm-fresh eggs in the fridge with supplies and tools to make pancakes or waffles, and there was also a vintage-style popcorn maker, which was fun to re-experience. The outdoor spaces were well adorned with the hot tub on the back porch and the fire pit, lounge chairs, and grill on the other side. The record player in the corner was such a nice touch as well!
The usual vacation things were also of very nice quality... the bed and bedding were divine, the robes and towels were super soft, and the bathroom was well stocked with toiletries.
Highly recommend staying with Kimberly! :)"

Mrs. Kim took such good care of us throughout our entire stay and answered all of our questions so quickly. She discovered there was a problem with the hot tub a few hours before our check-in time and called to let us know we had the option of staying in her other space while she and her husband got it taken care of. It was fixed quickly and she even comped our first night because of it, she truly went above and beyond for us all weekend long. This is the perfect place for a getaway and the boat ramp right down the road was the cherry on top! We loved this stay and started planning a trip to come back before we even left! Thank you for a great stay, Kim and Jeff!"

Stayed one night","My wife and I just spent a weekend a couple months earlier at ""the roost"", Kimberly's treehouse rental and loved it, we had to come back. We loved ""the fox den"" just as much. The area is so quiet and peaceful giving us the away time we so love. Made for an amazing Valentines/Anniversary get away. The place was clean, well kept and had all of the amenities you would ever need for a home away from home."

Check in was super easy, the place looked exactly as shown, and I felt completely safe. This will surely be my go to getaway!"

Stayed one night",My husband and I had the best stay here at Fox’s Den. Kim was an amazing host and made sure to have instructions written out to everything. She also went above and beyond to provide everything for it to feel like a home. The decor was to die for! From the hanging swing all the way down to the Volkswagen tissue box. We really loved the added details of the 70’s memorabilia everywhere. Kim really put her heart into this place and it shows. The hot tub was such a nice thing to have after a long day. There was an Atari system included and we really enjoyed getting cozy and trying to beat each other in frogger. If you’re looking for a quiet and peaceful getaway this is the place!

Stayed with kids","When my family and I came to town to deal with a family emergency, we looked for a spot that we could afford AND would be as comfortable as home to help mitigate the stress we were all under. We found that and more in Carla's beautiful, spacious home. The kitchen is well stocked and the best part: TWO LIVING ROOMS WITH TV'S that made traveling with a teenager easier than ever!
Carla is also a stellar host. One morning halfway into our stay, we awoke to a problem with the furnace during a major cold spell. Carla not only started the process to get the furnace fixed ASAP, but she got another of her listings ready for us in the event she couldn't get the heat going again in a timely fashion. Fortunately, the HVAC repair person got it back up and running the same day, and all was well. I can't recommend Carla enough, and if you need a place to stay for an extended period in Poplar Bluff like we did, look no further than Stoney Manor!"

The master bath is not practical for those with any kind of mobility issues, so I recommend that you sleep in one of the bedrooms on the other side of the house.
That said, if I’m on the road again in the area I will be happy to stay at one of Carla’s properties."

The kitchen was roomy and the two living room spaces were super inviting. The big, comfy sectionals were perfect for gathering. The bedrooms were wonderful and the beds comfortable. The location was minutes away from everything. We had an issue the first night, but Carla had it fixed promptly. Our family got to be together to share meals and moments instead of being separated in hotel rooms. Everyone commented on how warm and inviting the house was and how comfortable we all were during our stay. I highly recommend Stoney Manor to anyone desiring a family/friend gathering place in Poplar Bluff."

Group trip","I took a weekend trip with my son & his buddies. There were 6 of us. It was perfect size, and only 40 min to current river.. It was a perfect location for what I planned. I also enjoy hiking, and there is a trail pretty close that I was able to go walk while they hung out and was grilling supper. We do plan to rent the house again for when we plan another current river trip. I couldn't have been more satisfied. Shannon even allowed us to check in early."

Random but shower water pressure was super good!! Also responsive friendly host. Beautiful nature surrounding the cabin. Wish I could move this house to Texas and live in it :)

Stayed one night","This was a perfect place for our family of four to stop on our way home from vacation. Very well-kept and clean, open and spacious living space, and comfy beds, to go with a quiet, off the beaten path location with a huge yard. There’s no wi-fi and even LTE connection is very spotty, but for a short stay that wasn’t an issue for us at all. Would definitely stay here again."

Stayed with kids","I loved this place! It was beautiful inside and we felt right at home. My 4 children and I stayed for only 1 night, but we would've stayed longer if we could've. The shower worked great, and it was nice to have the opportunity to do laundry before hitting the road again. My kids were disappointed there wasn't any wi-fi, but it gave us more time together since they couldn't have their faces in screens 😂. There were hiking trails right down the road that go for miles and miles, and we saw several turtles on our morning hike. I'd definitely come back for a stay if ever in the area again!"

Everything was easy and predictable (no surprises). Beautifully done home. The remodeling effort was very well done in every way.
Thank You Shannon !!"

Just like staying at your own home, there’s everything for cooking, like spices, condiments, waffle maker, deep fryer, griddle, BBQs…pebble ice maker and wine fridge etc! Amazing views, super private & cozy relaxing places to sit, sunbathe or enjoy the nights under the deck playing corn hole or lounging around the outdoor fire place. Every time I thought, “Oh, I need a…” I’d find whatever my need was. Comfy beds and luxurious bathrooms! 100% love the decor!! Gorgeous landscaped grounds with creative lighting…and a shocking lack of mosquitoes! We sat outside late into the night and got no bites!! One unexpected but much cherished feature was Tom the cat…so gentle and sweet that we looked forward to his company starting each day! Can’t say enough good things about how responsive our host was too! We would love to visit in the future and completely recommend!"

What you will enjoy most is all of the amenities of the home as we only ate out 1 time during our 10 day stay because being at the cabin was so enjoyable. Our resounding comment was it was so peaceful with the river being directly behind the cabin. If your looking for a place to unplug, this is your place! We hope you enjoy it as much as we did! Thanks Kerri!"

Stayed a few nights","First of all, this was the best air b&b we ever stayed. We came to the area for an event so the price was maybe higher but, for what we were looking for with 2 couples and the event, we could not have made a better choice. The house and peaceful quiet surroundings was Ideal!! Our host's personal touches was also very fun and thoughtful. We all agreed that we will try to come back with more time to just relax and enjoy the whole location. We feel the place is significant to visit without an event that brought us there. We'll be looking ahead to our calendars. Thanks very much to our hosts!"

Stayed a few nights","Let’s start with, BOOK IT NOW! Kerri’s cabin is absolutely gorgeous and perfect for a secluded family getaway. When I say everything about this listing is above and beyond what your expectations are, I mean EVERYTHING. We were greeted with the most welcoming personal host, Tom the cat, my daughters enjoyed every second of Tom’s cuddles on the amazing back porch. The kitchen is locked and loaded with any spice/cooking need one would need for cooking.. on the Blackstone! There was no need to eat out because with everything Kerri provides there is absolutely no need. I could go on and on about how awesome every detail of this cabin is, but you need to book it and experience it instead yourself - you won’t be disappointed."

Stayed with kids","Book it. It will be worth it. You are going to be wowed. What a view, what a farm, what a getaway of serenity and relaxation. We walked the beach twice during our overnight stay and our littles absolutely loved playing in the water. We ate dinner at Lambert’s in Sikeston and snuggled in for a cozy night together. We quickly befriended Tom, the cat, and our family of four felt right at home with the wildlife inside Kerri’s cabin. Favorite touches: front porch swing, kitchen tabletop, vaulted ceiling low lights, upstairs shower, bobcat rug, and hot cocoa. Thank you, Kerri, for a lovely last night of our family vacation. We were rested and ready to head home after staying at your retreat."

We loved that we were able to use the black stone grill to cook our meals and then eat on the deck. I would definitely recommend this place. We had an amazing stay and will definitely be coming back.

The kitchen was well provisioned with nice appliances and great pots, pans and dishes. Plus 3 (!) grills. We ate every meal In because there was no reason to go out. The bedrooms and bathrooms were ample sizes (loved the sunken tub for a good soak). The great room was ideal for hanging out. Perhaps the best feature was the wrap-around porch with spacious, comfy seating. We spent most of the day on the porch - lounging, reading, watching the water from the Black River. A perfect get-away. And, lest I forget, Tom the cat was an absolute delight. We really wanted to bring him home…"
