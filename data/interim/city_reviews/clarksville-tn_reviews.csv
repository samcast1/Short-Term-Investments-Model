Stayed one night","The spot was very well done! The building is very old, but as soon as you get into the room you can't tell at all! The arena was probably 1 minute walking distance, and there were a bunch of restaurants near by. Perfect little spot for a couple trying to get out and spend some alone time together! Ethan was very helpful and very responsive, and made it his goal to make sure we had an amazing time there!"

Stayed a few nights",The CUTEST little get away! I was in town on work and I absolutely adored the place! And it was within my extremely low range per diem! It’s the sweetest touch of Paris and made me want to come straight home and build a loft similar! I have been looking for reasons to travel back to Clarksville just to stay again! 17/10 would recommend.

Stayed one night",I must say this place and stay was amazing. It’s perfectly located within a close driving distance to everything. Definitely love the area great for walking or a commute on a transit bus. And the bonus is there are many great restaurants in walking distance and a very good ice cream shop within a quick 1 minute walk and yes 1 minute walk.

Stayed a few nights","Ethan was a gracious host who earned our respect immediately. He over compensated to make our stay perfect! Ethan provided extra amenities that he didn’t have to…and out of kindness…offered extras that we were not entitled to and assisted where he could. We visit Clarksville, TN often and will return to Ethan’s same adorable loft that is well-maintained…clean and in a perfect downtown setting. A quaint city and many shops and restaurants within walking distance. Ethan’s loft apartment offered more than we ever needed! Thumbs way up to a wonderful and giving host! We appreciate Ethan and the great time we had this past weekend!"

Stayed one night","Loved this loft and the location, especially since we were going to an event at F&M Bank Arena. Only a block away!
The only downfall to our stay was the upstairs neighbors decided to start moving furniture or something very loud from 6am until around 9am. 🙃
Other than that we loved this loft and the location!
Thanks Ethan for being a wonderful host!"

The riverfront is about a 10-minute walk away, and it's only steps away from all the cafes and restaurants.
Bed comfortable, stand-up shower (no tub) is very specious. Loft overlooks the street.
Ethan was the perfect host and communicator! Easy checkin and checkout. Will stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","Everything about this place is wonderful, from before check in communication, to the room, to the comfy bed, to the exit communication. This is my official Go To when I am in Clarksville now! I felt so comfortable. You will want to park in the parking garage, but it is just across the street a bit (bring an umbrella if it rains) and a parking pass is provided (just remember to return it). PLENTY to do within walking distance, and there are bike rentals by the parking garage if you wanted to explore a little further.
Something to note that did not bother me in the least but may bother others, it is an old building that has been updated. It has quirks and charms and thin walls. I take a fan with me and that blocked out the street noise and neighbor noise. It isn’t excessively loud, but it is a city so don’t expect quiet."

Right in the middle of downtown, easy walk to all the bars and restaurants. Ethan was very helpful and proactive in explaining the parking situation. The only caveat-if you stay in the winter, that bathroom just isn’t getting warm unless it’s from shower steam. But we had a lovely stay. Would definitely stay here again."

The apartment is lovely and perfectly placed in downtown Clarksville, within walking distance to a ton of great restaurants and shops. Ethan's recommendations for eats were spot-on! I highly recommend Strawberry Alley, the Mailroom, and La Costa. Ethan is friends with the owner of LaCosta, who treated me to my first ever Cafe con Queso! Mmmm...
My whole experience at Ethan's place and in Clarksville was superb. I cannot wait to return and will be booking Ethan's spot again and again when I do!"

Stayed a few nights","A charming cottage located walking distance from the Cumberland River. A short drive to Ft. Campbell, 5 short minutes to historic downtown Clarksville and close to many other landmarks as well as grocery stores. The cottage is highlighted with well chosen decor. Soft, high thread count bedding and fluffy towels are all a plus. The stairs leading to the absolutely wonderful second floor are steep and taking a heavy suitcase up/down is something you may want to think about. I am a chef and found the kitchen complete and suitable for basic needs. I would stay at any of Samantha and Giles locations without hesitation."

I will admit that I have very high standards for how clean a place is - especially the bathrooms, and I wasn’t 100% satisfied with the cleaning job. But aside from a few small issues I discussed with the host (who was always quick to respond to messages), the space felt clean and comfortable. My only other small complaint was that guests are asked to take out the trash (a common Airbnb request, I realize) …but the dumpster is quite a walk from the unit."

Pros: Super clean, easy check-in and out, came with amenities such as coffee, snacks, etc, super comfy beds, quiet and peaceful neighborhood, really nice backyard! The house is super cute, just as pictured!!!
The only con: The sliding glass doors leading to the backyard don't have any blinds or curtains so there could be a privacy concern to anyone who really likes their privacy although it isn't visible to the street it anything- just the neighbors backyards, although there is a fence!
Overall, I loved my stay here and so did my guests. Amy was super accommodating and made sure we were comfy and taken care of! I'd definitely stay here again :)"

Stayed a few nights","This place has potential and good location. The tops of surfaces and beds were clean. The entire unit needs painted with holes filled. There are huge scuff marks on all walls low and high. There is large amounts of dust on all baseboards, walls, celling fans, celling vents, decor, and just general grime. The spare bathroom shower curtain was gross and dirty. There is a sign that offers you creamer for coffee which is located in the fridge. That creamer was opened, both were more than half used and one was expired. The sliding glass door has a lock that is broken and they just put a broomstick for security. We booked for the bathtub and we decided not to use it because of general untidiness of the house. We did not cook in the house but there are very few items in cabinets. This house needs an extreme deep clean. The previous reviews, do not match what we experienced. If you expect clean, do not stay here. We travel and stay with Airbnb frequently. I’m unsure how this is rated highly and how they are super hosts."

We enjoyed our stay here! My only recommendation would be to put curtains on the sliding glass door that leads into the backyard. The master bed wasn’t horrible, but I definitely felt it in my hips after about two days of sleeping on it. So maybe in the future investing in a more comfortable mattress.
Outside of that… it was a nice spacious home that met all of our needs! We highly recommend property!"

The house is fabulous. It is immaculately clean and so well designed and decorated that it belongs in Better Homes and Gardens magazine as a showcase for airbnb community. Amy's house and her hosting are a testament to what the airbnb community stands for. It is one by which others should be judged. The house is incredibly comfortable with nice furniture and beautiful decor. I could not have been more pleased. I cannot wait to visit here again, and I would strongly recommend this place to anyone wanting a perfect place to stay in the Clarksville area."

My reservation request was made the same day as check in and the whole process was so smooth. Amy was so responsive and even offered to assist us in any way we needed.

Towels, coffee and snacks were all provided. The only minor complaint we had were the lack of hand soap in bathrooms (the bottles were empty). Otherwise everything was fantastic. I would definitely recommend staying here."

Located in a quite subdivision within a 10 minute drive of downtown the house was roomy, comfortable, and provided for everything three trial lawyers from out of town needed during a lengthy stay. The home is within minutes of tons of restaurants and stores, and the home contained virtually all of the accoutrements we needed to make our stay as close to being at home as possible. Super place, and we highly recommend it to business travelers."

The neighborhood is extremely beautiful, space, and gorgeous.
The inside is absolutely immaculate with very unique and special features by Amy.
I visited solo for a quick work trip, but this home can accommodate a large group, family, or perfect for solo travelers as well!
Amy makes you feel right at home with every detail. She really cares about the guest experience! This location is perfect and SO close to everything you need in the area within a 5-10 minute drive to EVERYTHING you need & anywhere you go.
I felt MORE than at home and will be definitely staying again, and hopefully for longer next time!
Communication was also amazing. Hands down the best, I cannot say how great this host is and how special and unique this house is! 100/100! 💯 & a FIVE STAR STAY! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

It had a hidden surprise that was not disclosed on the description nor was it listed in the house rules. A infrared camera is placed in the living room. We did NOT discover it until we were checking out. It started clicking. Needless to say we were creeped out and angry. This is a huge violation of someone's privacy. I understand wanting to protect your home but to record someone without their knowledge or consent in a place where most people would expect privacy is wrong. This behavior is creepy, gross and illegal."

Clarksville happens to land in the sweet spot for my travels north to south and back, so I am glad I can stay at Tamara's place. It's cozy, clean, and has everything I need -including a netflix guest account so I don't have to watch on my laptop -which I use comfortably at the bar in the kitchen with coffee or a beer while getting work done. Also, plenty of places to pick up a meal within 10-15 minutes."

Stayed a few nights","What a pleasure staying in Tamara’s pool house… even if it wasn’t pool weather!! Everyone (dogs included! were so friendly and welcoming! The pool house was so sparkling clean and fresh it looked brand new!! We were fortunate to find Tamara’s space for a thanksgiving trip to visit our kids and we will certainly hope to stay there in the future!! Very comfortable, we felt very safe, and it’s very conveniently located. Five stars all the way around. Tamara is a Super host for several reasons, but here’s a reason we experienced… we weren’t completely comfortable operating the HVAC properly and reached out for help. She had us warm and toasty in no time!! We HIGHLY recommend checking out this gem! You will be glad you did, just as we are!"

Stayed one night","Tamara's place was a perfect pause in my road trip. Easy to find, quiet, all the amenities one would need and so much better than a highway-side hotel -it's worth the extra 15 minutes to get off I24 and stay in a well-kept place. Personally, my favorite airBNB are the ""shack in the back"" type, so I lean toward places like Tamara's -and it's not a shack, lol, but a well-appted guest cottage in the back. Good bed, eating ""bar top"" with stools, good wifi so I was able to get my work done and access to her Netflix acct so I can watch a show before hitting the colloquial hay. Parking is easy and signed. And, there's plenty of food choices in Clarksville -I'm into Korean food these days and there are choices for each return trip."

The place is spotless and well stocked with amenities and kitchen items. The location feels pretty secluded for an in-town stay with a privacy fence around the area. Parking is pretty close. Food options, historical sights, local parks, a lively downtown, and shopping are all nearby. This was a good stay for some rest and short trips to fill the day. Tamara was a very good host.

Group trip","The place was beautiful and clean except for downstairs bathroom. We were texted it was out of order while in transit. We should have been informed of the situation prior to check in date.We thought we could make it work But commode was full of foul smelling water making it hard to stay downstairs. I specifically asked if anyone flushed it.They said no it was already there as they were viewing the space upon arrival.water also in bathtub and clothes in drawers. Tv also not working. Seeing conditions, we asked for refund but realized we had no place to go after traveling 8 hours out of state. We decided to stay and make the best of it but asked for half refund due to the fact we paid for 3 1/2 bathrooms as advertised; the reason we chose the unit; but was only able to use 2 1/2, making it uncomfortable for all.Thankfully half refund was returned and they seem to want to make things right.However they think the broken bathroom was used and stated we will have to pay extra fees"

I don’t see that a lot, it was very convenient. Also the coffee maker as well as complementary coffee. I could tell the host really put a lot of thought and effort in to making the guest feel at home. I would definitely recommend staying here.

We had dinner and did some shopping also within a mile. But the home was nestled privately on a hill and looked hidden away like a little treehouse.
We woke up to TONS of rain and storms outside, and the bottom floor had some water come in. However the place is clearly new and Matthew was quick to respond with a handyman coming to get that cleaned and fixed! Things like that happen!
Otherwise this trip was perfect and wonderful and we’d definitely come back!!!"

(I was more chilly but warmed up comfortably, my husband not so much lol) other than that, it was a great stay! Great communication, great location from where we needed to go everyday which was in a different town, everything we needed to stay in for the week, and check out was easy as well. I would stay here again for sure and I know my husband would prepare accordingly next time. I recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","Matthew was helpful and responded very quickly when I asked for recommendations. We planned this for a quiet, long weekend with cozy vibes to read, drink coffee and relax. This was the perfect spot! Clarksville was also a great town and Matthew provided a lot of recommendations at the house & when specifically asked and all were exactly what we wanted. Overall, the house was clean, cozy and exactly as explained in the listing."

Stayed a few nights","Easily one of my best rental experiences. Matthew was very responsive. He was able to add a day for me relatively last minute. The rents was pristine, homey, perfect for a weekend. I worked remotely while there and had no issues with connectivity. Kitchen had everything I needed to make my meals, and location is close enough for an Instacart delivery and food delivery. I wish I’d gotten to use the fire pit, but snow prevented it. Hoping to return on my next trip to the area."

Stayed a few nights","I'm not really a ""5 stars unless the place sucks"" reviewer (check out my other reviews for proof) but this experience was very solid. What I needed was a place near my family's farm (I am visiting from out of town) with 3 bedrooms, quiet, clean, and inexpensive. That's exactly what I got.
The place was located well for what I needed, clean, everything was provided (dishes, laundry room and detergent, cleaning supplies if needed) and the gaming table (Foosball) was a nice added touch. Showers were clean and the beds were VERY comfortable. The host was lightning fast to reply to any questions I have.
As a nice bonus, the check-out / clean-up procedures were very reasonable. Many AirBNB hosts require you to do extensive chores these days on top of having cleaning fees; this place simply asked me to take out the trash and to load & start the dishwasher. No turning down / making beds, no laundry, etc.
I'd definitely come back in the future for more family visits."

Stayed with kids","Overall, our stay at this Airbnb was decent. While the location was initially a bit tricky to find, the provided directions proved helpful. The space itself was clean and inviting, and the owners were attentive, repeatedly checking if we needed anything and emphasizing the importance of 5-star reviews. However, the beds were quite firm, which might not be to everyone's preference. Additionally, we found the towel situation lacking, with only 4 towels provided for a group of 6 over a 2-night stay. When we requested more towels, they promised to bring them promptly the next morning but only arrived shortly before our departure, which inconvenienced us. They had to come into the space to unlock a linen closet to get more for us. This was frustrating. Despite our request for a later checkout due to this delay, we were granted only an extra hour. While not a terrible experience, it was frustrating, and I would suggest future guests bring their own towels to avoid similar issues."

Stayed a few nights","This is my second time at a Giles and Samantha hosted listing and I just can’t say enough how awesome they are. They leave a few treats, the place is always cleaned very well and they are very responsive to questions! Clarksville is an awesome growing town and this location is perfect to be in the heart of their downtown! I will continue to rent with Giles and Samantha for each visit!"

Very evident hosts would do anything to make our stay as comfortable and carefree (even to come and help get on tv if we weren’t able to resolve after following their instructions…which were perfect with no need for them to make a visit). Definitely follow instructions for parking (carport was wonderful since we had rain on several occasions). Would absolutely stay here again next time we travel to Clarksville which is a certain.

Stayed a few nights","A great place to stay in Clarksville! We were a 10 minute walk from the Roxy Theater and lots of downtown dining. Just be ready to go up and down some hills on that walk! They also offered bikes!
The wall murals you see in the pics are hand painted, and much of the art and photography on the walls features local landmarks. It felt like a big ""Welcome to Clarksville!""
I'd recommend this property and these hosts for people visiting downtown or the university as long as you are able to use stairs! (bedrooms are both upstairs) You will be just as charmed in-person as you are when you view the cute photos!
Thank you for the beautiful place to stay, Samantha & Giles!"

The linens were WHITE and the towels were WHITE... crisp, clean and white! The sinks and toilets sparkled and the shower curtain liners were clean and clear! There was a new sponge on the kitchen sink and the refrigerator was immaculate! The amenities of bottled water, pretzels, 'York Peppermint Patties' and a bottle of wine were a much appreciated surprise! The property is with in walking distance to downtown Clarksville, restaurants and night life. There is a great balcony-deck off of the master bedroom with a 'bar' and couch. Our stay was perfect!

Stayed one night",This was an awesome find! I was able to check in late due to a long drive and the house was ready for me to crash. It was a home away from home. I enjoyed the personal hot tub and fire pit in the back yard. There were specific easy directions on how to operate all the amenities that were included. I look forward in staying at this house again.

Stayed with kids","If you are looking for a home away from home, Mechellela’s home in Clarksville, TN is the place to stay! Whatever we needed, she had available. It is placed in the middle of a quiet area with little to no traffic. The 24 hour surveillance system made us feel 100% comfortable. Anytime we had questions, Mechellela or Sammie answered quickly - since the day we booked our stay!
She really made this trip a memorable one for my family! I could not say enough good things about Mechellela and her bnb!
Highly, highly recommend!"

Lastly, I felt extra safe with the home alarm, ring camera on the driveway on my car, and the locks for the front door and backyard gate.
The host is very thoughtful in all their offerings and timely communication."
