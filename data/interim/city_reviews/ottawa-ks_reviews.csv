Stayed a few nights","Eric and Cheryl’s place is very unique. We arrived late at night and the church big and overwhelming. Once inside it was absolutely beautiful and comfortable. We visited for a graduation and it was central to every direction we needed to go. The kitchen was wonderful and they allowed us to have a few people over to have cake to celebrate my daughter. The space was perfect before heading to dinner. The kitchen was fully stocked. Beds are very comfy.
I’d still rate this home a 5, but it was quite dirty. A lot of dust and cobwebs. The floors were very dirty and there was a load of bedding in the dryer. We had to use the washer and dryer while we were there because we have a small child that got very dirty, otherwise we wouldn’t have noticed the full dryer.
Hosts were quick to respond to everything except when I requested a credit of money paid for booking and canceling bc of an emergency. I was able to rebook and fulfill the reservation but they didn’t honor my request or follow up."

Stayed a few nights","Eric and his wife were fantastic hosts. The place was truly incredible and exactly what we needed. This historic church is renowned in the community, and it holds special significance for my family, as they had worked on it during its time as the 'Hope House.' It was heartwarming to discover that many of our family members had contributed to the place when it served as the Hope House. The space was incredibly comfortable and perfectly suited for hosting a large family dinner. Every guest who joined us was astounded by the renovations and the effort put into restoring the place. We are sincerely grateful for this unforgettable experience."

Stayed a few nights","We had a restful stay in Ottawa, a lovely small town in Kansas 20 miles from thriving Lawrence. The place is just a couple blocks from a sweet downtown and a few blocks from a beautiful bike path. The hosts were responsive to our many questions as we settled in. The master bedroom and bath were spacious and comfortable. Being converted from a church allowed for a church-size kitchen with plenty of counter space. We enjoyed walking along beautiful old homes in the tree-lined neighborhood, going to a farmer’s market for fresh local meat, eggs, and vegetables, hiking miles of shaded bike path, and feasting on home cooked meals. It was just the R&R we needed. We recommend this getaway, and we certainly will be back!"

Stayed with kids","The farmhouse was beautiful. The trail cut through the woods and farm was great for our family get out and explore! Lots to look at and lots of relaxing. The only downside was the squeaky bunk bed, our boys had a hard time getting to sleep if the other one moved a bit causing lots of noise. The only other issue (mostly for small kids) is the very hot furnace fireplaces that heat the house. To me they were very cool and worked great, our boys loved laying right in front and warming up! But for our 1 year old it was always a thought on our minds to make sure she was away from them. Overall the place was great and our family had a great time! We would rent again!!"

The house was clean, tidy, and welcoming - Lara had even written our daughter a ""Good luck at Regionals"" (gymnastics) welcoming at the entrance! Talk about attention to detail! The accommodation was just as advertised. The kitchen and bathroom were stocked with everything we needed, and the appliances were in great working condition. We played games (provided), watched a DVD (many provided), and made smores around the firepit in the backyard. Everyone agreed the beds were cozy. We enjoyed walking the short path around the property. The garage was utilized for parking our vehicles when a sudden thunderstorm arose. We all relished the relaxation and togetherness the property provided! If ever needing to stay in the Topeka area again, we will definitely be back! Thank you Lara for being such an amazing host!"

Everything was as Lara described. We enjoyed doing a puzzle together and playing the games provided on the large coffee table. The only downside is that it's very close to the highway, which Lara aptly disclosed, but that made time outside a little less peaceful than we'd hoped. Not a huge deal, but something to keep in mind. Overall, a great place to reconnect and relax."

Not only was the farmhouse beautifully decorated but it was so much larger than the pictures give it credit for!!! Definitely a must see in person. Plenty of safe parking and easy check in and out. We felt right at home. My mom and son and I played games, watched Christmas movies, made s’mores at the fire pit, took walks and did crafts. No phones! (except for pictures) That was my favorite thing of all. We truly got to enjoy each other’s company. We cannot thank Eleanor’s and Lara enough for a perfect time."

Stayed a few nights","Just a lovely Oasis. It was closer to the highway than I thought it would be, which was weird at first but honestly wasn't very noticable during our stay. The house is so welcoming, Lara had water and ice in the fridge and snacks and spices ready. The leather couches in the living room are so comfy and the entertainment center is loaded with DVDs and games. The kitchen was easy to navigate.
I highly recommend driving South to Lyndon and visiting the Chapters bookstore and the coffee shop up the street. It added to our experience to have great food choices near the house. We ate at Buzzards Pizza and Cilantros.
We will be back to Eleanor's Farmhouse and I will recommend it to anyone who needs a quiet, cozy retreat."

We all thought that was an awesome gesture! The house was cute and cozy. We felt safe and at home there. Lara was so easy to communicate with and respected our privacy. The family games provided were a nice added touch. The lighted fire pit area was awesome. My family enjoyed walking the trails around the property. There were no houses on either side of the Eleanors so you had complete privacy. We would definitely stay here again if in the area and would recommend to everyone to stay there!"

She made sure the place was clean, we had everything we needed for our stay, gave clear instructions, and she was extremely kind throughout. The space was absolutely breathtaking. We made good use of the fire pits and smores sticks. The house was so comfortable and luxurious, and the property was just gorgeous. Most of us went on individual walks on some of the trails. It was very serene. This stay was everything we needed and to think it all came together last second is just mind boggling.

She was so prompt in her responses when we reached out to her even while we were at the house!
We were meeting as a family of 16 for the weekend of our Mom's Celebration of Life. It was wonderful for gathering together with enough space for all of us to be together and enough room to spread out if we need a break from close proximity. Beautiful decor that wasn't too overwhelming!
Plenty of hot water and water pressure. Large kitchen. Great extra touches, such as soaps and shampoos, plenty of linens, extra bed options, a beautifully written welcome note with lovely gifts for our group to take home and goodies to use during our stay.
She has a wonderful gift of hospitality and wants her guests to feel welcome! Five Star!"

Stayed with kids","This is our second time staying at one of John’s places. We stayed at one nearly five years ago, which has since been redecorated. This was another top notch stay. It was comfortable and had everything we needed for our stay. The bed in the bedroom is arguably the most comfortable mattress I’ve ever slept in away from home. Thank you John for continuing to offer these in Ottawa. In a small town, these are truly are the gem of Kansas."

I was traveling by myself for business, and appreciated that it was a quiet, off the main road place to stay, but also was within walking distance of my favorite thing: Kansas Mainstreets! Easy to find, and easy access to more ""modern conveniences"" by car ride as well. (by modern conveniences, I mean the grocery store and some fastfood ;-) )"

Would definitely stay again if I’m ever passing through Ottawa. Great location to the downtown area as well. Following the last review, I wanted to provide a cockroach update. We did see multiple roaches outside the house when we arrived at night, likely due to the summer humidity. The house was spotless with the exception of one roach we saw in the kitchen. We did not see it the next morning, nor did we see any outside the front door. Otherwise the place was perfect. Even given the minor issue, I would stay again."

Stayed a few nights","This is a beautiful space with fun decor in a small town with so much to do. Were it not for a few issues, this would be my favorite AirBnB so far. John is responsive and offered a partial refund as soon as I made him aware of the problem. I don't doubt he will take care of it, but until then I felt future renters should be aware.
The issues I encountered were bugs. Lots of bugs. I arrived after dark and to my dismay the grass in front of the apartment was infested with roaches. I had never seen such a thing but a Google search identified them as lawn roaches. We saw them that night and any other time we were out after dark. We also had to outmaneuver a few roaches to prevent them from running in as we entered the front door. We encountered 3 roaches inside the apartment as well. The entire place is SPOTLESS - sparkly clean - so I can only assume they are managing to sneak in from their home in the lawn. I also saw a brown recluse crawl out from under the washing machine.
As soon as this problem is eliminated, John's place will be the perfect place to stay. The decor is on point, plenty of plates and cutlery available, a Keurig with a generous amount of coffee provided, and plenty of towels. The vintage fridge and stove/oven are so fun and work perfectly. There are vintage games and a record player in the living room.
Ottawa is a small town with lots to offer. There was live music and food trucks in the park, coffee shops, a decent variety of restaurants. We had dinner at Luigi's which was outstanding. Right next door is a music store where I got an incredible deal on an electric violin, and got invited to their weekly jam (alas, it is a 10 hour drive from where I live 😄). What a great community! I found myself daydreaming of moving there."

The space is SO cozy & always extremely clean. The backyard space is large & private, the fire pit & stars are epic & it's a quick drive or short-ish walk down the gravel road over to the lake, boat ramp & hiking trails.
My brother & I had a much-needed 'chill zone' weekend out at the farm & left better than we came. Will DEFINITELY be back!
Can't forget June & Petunia...they're a treat & LOVE their special, donkey-approved treats - especially strawberries! Apples & carrots were a hit too.
Stop looking & start booking :)"

Ty brought firewood and started us a fire to keep warm. Ty and Marcie went grocery shopping for us so we had food. When we got stuck in snow Ty was up early in freezing snow pulling me out so I could go to work. They took care of us as if we were family! Oh yes! The house was very comfortable and clean!

Stayed a few nights","Ty's place was exactly what we needed! We were in the area to celebrate a belated Christmas with several of our children and grandchildren. They all stayed at our daughter's large house, but we ""older"" people wanted our ""own"" space. Ty's place was perfect for that. It was located half a mile from our daughter's home, in a beautiful location, peaceful and quiet. It was perfect for us! Ty's place was exactly like they said in the ad. They provided everything we could need and more! The only thing that saddened us was that we didn't get to see the mules. We had brought apples to let the grandkids feed them. I am assuming this was because of the cold, wet weather and the mules were probably in the barn. Ty has no control over the weather! So we will try again this summer! This is a place we will return to! Thank you Ty and Marcie for making our stay exactly what we needed!"

Ty and Marcie's instructions are very clear, and everything is well stocked and easy to find. Beds are very comfortable and quiet, ac works great. Beautiful nights by the fire pit with plenty of wood right on hand. The donkeys and chickens are friendly and fun to feed, and Mango the dog is a sweetheart. If you are a fellow birdwatcher, morning coffee at the picnic table is a treat, too. Bring bug spray for night time outside though, especially after a heavy rain. Overall 5+/5. Thanks to Ty and Marcie for providing this gem. Hope to stay again one day when we are back in the area."

John and Carol were great hosts and provided a few things I needed, as well as being immediately responsive. I would definitely recommend syncing your own music to the Bluetooth speakers—the sound is awesome. This AirBnB is well worth the visit to Ottowa!"

The ""Orange"" room which is what my wife calls the ""Sherbert"" is perfect in all ways. Central location, walk to restaurants, first floor, quiet neighborhood, and parking 12' from the front door. Matching chairs aside the 1960's Bluetooth-equipped stereo console with our Spotify 1960's playlist is pure time travel. Splash on a little Tabu or Brut prior to your downtown walk."

John and Carol have impeccable taste and the space is appointed with just the right amount of kitsch. The photos don't really do the space justice. The vintage turntable, radio, collectibles and mid century furniture add to the style and appeal. Highly recommend!"

We have stayed in many Airbnb's and my wife and I firmly say this is the best one yet. So close to all the best restaurants in Ottawa's historic town. Really....It's like a 3-minute walk to Pizza, Mexican and Italian. Not your normal restaurants either. All are top-rated establishments and fairly priced. Don't hesitate to stay at the Sherbet Suite one block from all the action downtown. The space has retro furniture and a very relaxing atmosphere we were sad to leave. And the 1960's big wood stereo console really kicked it, and it had a Bluetooth device that immediately connected to our Spotify. We will be back."

Lots of quirky accessories to examine, including a limited edition Buck Rogers Ray Gun. We also really appreciated the Barbarella posters from the Jane Fonda movie. Great color scheme.
Be forewarned, there is a fair amount of noise from the HVAC system, which is in the center of the apartment, so it’s very hard to escape from the noise of the blower motor."

The bed is incredibly comfortable, the rainfall shower will comfortably shower any person. The amount of outlets was so appreciated. The ability to connect my music playlist to the retro radio was awesome. The dishes, the almond milk in the fridge, the abundance of coffee. I loved it all and will now be a regular. You can tell this place is more than just a money maker. It took some heart and soul to create it. The location is outstanding!

It was perfect for me alone, and there was room for my wife and daughter if I did bring them. The kitchen had everything one would need to cook in (which I did for the week). My only regret is that I didn't have time to go and explore the area with my Nikon and some of John's photography tips.

Stayed a few nights","I was visiting from Texas and I couldn’t find anything close to Ottawa and oh how this place just blew me out of the air. Completely better than I expected and for good pricing. My boyfriend and I absolutely loved the place it had its own style that throws you in a bit of a time machine. The whole place was styled and it certainly felt very comfortable even being so far away from home. John was very hospitable throughout the whole stay and made it very easy for check in and check out. Ottawa itself is a beautiful small town and the place was right in downtown ottawa, very easy to go shopping by foot and explore the town. I completely recommend staying here, I will definitely be booking again next time I’m in Ottawa."

The owner was just as amazing very helpful and knowledgeable of the surrounding area. And was very quick to respond if there was questions or concerns. Definitely recommend this accommodation to any traveler heading to Wolf Creek Nuclear Station in Burlington Kansas and Ottawa Kansas was the closest town near the Bunkhouse only 7 miles from the location.

The view was gorgeous, especially at 5am as the sun was coming up.
Well maintained outside - grass was short so our pups had a massive area to romp after the 8 hr drive up.
Inside was incredibly clean - floors, counters, furniture, bedrooms. Beds were comfy and the a/c kept the house nice and cool. Washer & dryer worked great, even had a couple detergent options.
Location was perfect for us. 35 minutes from our event and 20 minutes to town.
We will absolutely be coming back the next dog event we have up this way!"

Group trip","Kania's place is located within 15 minutes of anywhere in town. The neighborhood is peaceful and getting to and from the home was quick and easy. The home itself was much larger inside than what it appears on the outside, yet it still felt very cozy and relaxing inside. The home is full of character and charm. My wife and Aunt loved the decor and aesthetics of the home. We also loved the added amenities such as toothbrushes and razors in case you forgot your own. For those who enjoy snacking, it was great to have snacks provided especially if you have late night cravings! We were also quite impressed with the lot size given that it's an older neighborhood in a small town. There was plenty of space to hangout and have a good time out on the massive deck or in the large yard. This is especially great if you have multiple guests or kids who want to run around. We would highly recommend Kania's place to anyone staying in town and would definitely choose it again if we're in the area!"

Stayed a few nights",Kanias house was amazing!! She has put so much thought and detail into every inch of the house. We were greeted by fresh flowers from her yard. They were beautiful. We were traveling during a storm. Kania reached out to me to let me know they were on tornado watch and let me know there was emergency lighting at the house. We didn’t need it. But she was very very helpful and made us feel at ease. I can’t recommend this house enough. It had been my favorite airbnb to stay in. Every detail was perfect.

We stayed over Thanksgiving with our adult children and a grandbaby while visiting family in Kansas! It was perfect for us!
Tons of space! Beautifully decorated! Homey feeling! Quiet neighborhood!
The bedroom with the sitting room off the side was perfect for a baby in a playpen! Anything you could need (bathroom essentials, snacks, coffee bar, kitchen essentials, usb port for charging phones, first aid kit) is in this house because Kania has thought of everything! Especially if you have an appreciation of historical houses you will be blown away by the amazing details of this home!
We will definitely be back again! Thanks for a great stay Kania!"

I called the host beforehand so they would be prepared for family dropping by and lots of coming and going to and from wedding prep etc... they were very understanding. They were very friendly and shared info with us about their place. And best of all it was quiet and beautiful there. Will be recommending to any needing a place near there."

It is very private, with Scott's house 250 meters away the only other occupied structure on the farm.
We needed a place on relatively short notice for a KU football game, not too far distant from Lawrence (16 miles), and could also allow us to leave our dog unattended on game day. Turns out that Scott has an excellent chain link dog enclosure with insulated dog house at the lodge.
The kitchen and laundry room are what I would call fully equipped, with detergents, cleaning products kitchen utensils, herbs and spices; it was all there.
The welcome gift of a jar of clover honey from the farm's own apiary sweetened the deal."

Scott is great, very attentive, friendly and watchful especially when a hail storm went through. A favorite was the delicious clover honey that was harvested that day we got there! The perfect ending to parents weekend was being able to go fishing with our son at dusk on the Lake located on the property. Absolutely beautiful and was even able capture a picture of a bald eagle perched in a tree. Doesn’t get any better!"

On the second night, we arrived to find a camp fire set up for us by the host and some extra wood and some Cornhole boards, which we made good use of.
We might have errantly been expecting a little more privacy - didn't realize the property was on the same grounds as the host, but we didn't experience any problems.

Stayed with kids","Very nice house. Clean and nicely decorated. It is nice place to stay with no kids. Based on description and price, we thought it was a little bigger. Also, the heat only blows well in the small bedroom, And a little in the living room. So if you have any doors shut to the other rooms, they get cold fast. Especially, the back bedroom. The small bedroom door did not fully shut either.
Other than those few things, it’s a nice little place. And the host is very friendly."

Stayed about a week","Cute 2 bd 1 ba house in quiet neighborhood. Super comfy queen-sized beds. High gentle rain showerhead great for our tall people. Lou had it well stocked. Games, iron and board, garment steamer (didn't use but nice), dishes, pots, tea kettle, keurig And regular coffee maker, 3 kinds of coffee (the filters are in the fridge), several types of tea, toaster, appliances, lots of towels, lots of blankets, kleenex, books, baskets with: snacks shampoos, etc. etc. etc. Good heating system. The house was nicely decorated cute lamps, quilts, fab wood table, and seasonal decorations. Even had seasonal coffee available. Downsides:
Creepy back play room, we closed the curtains and ignored it.
Floors were very creaky. Bedrooms had doors for privacy, but you could still hear someone walking in main room. Felt uncomfortable moving around if someone went to sleep early.
Pin required for tv services: hulu, netflix, espn, etc, so couldn't use.

Stayed with kids",Lou is an excellent hostess. We met her upon arrival. She was friendly and made us feel welcome. Our family loves history; the Hickory house is full of nostalgia and tidbits of history everywhere. My kids enjoyed playing eye-spy with the pieces of local and family history and items that we guessed were probably hand-made. There were so many thoughtful touches that made this place a charming place to stay.

There’s nothing you’ll be in want of…she even had snacks laid out on the table. If we had more time we would have taken a walk downtown to eat out. Ottawa looks like a nice town with many dining options and has a laid back vibe. We will definitely stay here again if we are in the area."

Stayed a few nights",The Hickory house was a nice place to stay for the money. It was close enough to downtown for a nice easy walk and within two blocks of a very nice park. Made for a very relaxing stay. Check-in and check-out was very easy. All in all a good value.

Group trip","We just returned from our road trip to Kansas, where we stayed at the Hickory House in Ottawa. We were able to rest from our long journey and enjoy ourselves for the weekend with such a great place to stay. The house was clean, cozy, charming and well stocked with amenities. If we make it back this way we will definitely stay here again! Thanks Lou."

Stayed a few nights","This house is a WONDERFUL place to curl up with family!
While it's true that traveling always accompanies a sense of adventure and the wonder in discovery of new things, one fact is unavoidable: Staying in someone else's house--or even a hotel--never feels like home.
However, the hosts of The Hickory House have gone so far above and beyond expectations, familiar is nearer than it typically is in a VRBO setting. Listing everything would require pages and pages of accolades, but we'll relate some highlights here. This lovely home is stocked with just about everything you can possibly need--not only for a place to sleep and shower, but even for gatherings as well.
All the quotidian, expected accoutrements are easily present: hand soap, sanitizer, extra toilet paper, coffee, tea, creamer, sugar. But we also found a glut of additions which easily go overlooked when not provided.
Our mattress was clearly not a third hand-me-down from your cousin's guest room, guaranteed to leave you in pain the next day: we slept quite comfortably in the room that is most likely not considered the master bedroom (we selected it to be in the front of the house).
We didn't cook while we were here, but the basics are at our disposal as well, with a teakettle, plenty of dishes, pans, casserole dishes, cooking oil, a few basic spices, aluminum foil, blender, toaster, microwave, and three coffee makers--small/large standard drips and a Keurig. A fire extinguisher in the kitchen illustrates so well how thoroughly everything is planned.
One of the first things we noticed was the dining table, quaintly set in a welcoming arrangement. There was a basket of snacks and a stack of local restaurant menus and pamphlets describing local attractions. We unfortunately didn't get a photo--it was lovely before we ate lunch, displacing everything.
The house was clearly built in the early 20th century, and it retains all the charm from that time. However, there are just enough modern upgrades to make the stay practical. A remodeled shower and toilet top the list, because really... quaint is beautiful until you're actually using that Sears catalog for ""other"" progress and missing technological progress.
Other contemporary essentials include
5GHz (and 2.4) WiFi
and this reporter's favorite: a *wired* connection, for when additional security is needed (e.g. banking or remote work)
digital thermostat, super easy to use
A flat screen TV, probably 45"" (though we never turned it on)
power strips, outlet expanders, and extension cords (those old houses don't have many outlets--but the Hickory House has you covered)
A few unexpected things we found as pleasant surprises:
a coat tree just inside the door
folding chairs
umbrellas
about a million towels
plenty of drawers and dresser space
a flashlight
feminine products
basic medical, e.g. Tums, Tylenol, Ibuprofen, band-aids, allergy pills
zip lock sandwich bags
extra face masks
This is a beautiful slice of nostalgic Americana and an ideal place to relax and unwind or base family activities around OU. We can comfortably and confidently recommend The Hickory House to anyone who plans to stay in the Ottawa area.
Enjoy!"

Stayed a few nights","Enjoyed our stay at the Hickory House. Living in Wisconsin, we wanted to get away from the snow and ride our bikes in March and this Airbnb was great for that. There are two Rails to Trails there and easy to get on because of the Hickory House's location. We did 95 miles while there for four days. Very comfortable stay and the community was very courteous to bikes. Lou was easy to work with and got back to us quickly whenever we had questions. Several places to keep the bikes safe when not in use."

It was a great place to stay and host our college student and his friends for dinner. The house is very well laid out, very clean and had all the amenities we could ever need. We will be staying here EVERY time we come to Ottawa!"

Upgraded plug outlets for usb charging! Wi-fi, large TV, and so close to OU. There were lots of options to help keep safe during covid-masks, lysol, hand santizer! You’ve truly thought of everything.
