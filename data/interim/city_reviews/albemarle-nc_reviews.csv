Stayed with kids","This was my first time experiencing North Carolina, and a tiny home, and I was so pleasantly surprised how much I loved both! This tiny gem in the middle of gorgeous woods was just the peaceful respite we required. My three-year-old loved the deck, the loft bedroom, and had an absolute blast. The shower was so nice after a long day of travel, and I loved sharing close space with my family without feeling cramped.
Hosts were very kind and thoughtful and made sure we had everything we required. Wish we had more time to experience it!
Would highly recommend and would book again."

We really enjoyed it and sadly we didn’t have enough time to go see the other tiny homes that Brett was working on. Great experience in our first tiny home! Our family already wants to book their own trip to visit! 🩷

Stayed a few nights","I really enjoyed my stay. It was a great location out in the country, no traffic but modern conveniences just up the road. It was just as described. The bed was very comfortable and slept cool. The upper windows and ceiling fan created a nice cross breeze. It was also a nice view of the sky in the morning. Easy check in and Brett messaged me upon my arrival to ensure everything went smoothly. Just as described you can hear the paintball next door on the weekend but by the time they got started I was off to my events for the day and they did not play once it got dark so it wasn’t an issue. I would definitely stay again. Thanks so much Brett"

Stayed a few nights",Tiny Blue was perfect for our quick anniversary get away! It was so peaceful and tucked away which was exactly what we were looking for. Brett cautioned that we may hear noises from the paintball field not too far away but we never heard a thing even though it was packed both days! We cooked and ate out by the fire pit one night and while we were eating Brett messaged to let us know there were deer all in the yard behind Tiny Blue! It was so magical to be eating dinner while the deer grazed and ate as well right by us!!! It was a great trip!

The firepit was great and feeding the chickens was an added plus! If you are looking for a small space to stay with plenty of things to do, you should stay here! Many local restaurants, distilleries, wineries, and hiking locations available within a 20 minute drive. Did I mention there are chickens!!! 😀"

Stayed one night","This was an extraordinary bucket list stay that will not be our last in this cozy, fully stocked, comfy, and peaceful, tiny home. What an amazing experience for my hubby and I, along with our son who recently turned 18, and his pal. The four of us had an absolute blast! We spent the evening at a Charlotte Hornets basketball game and settled into our tiny home nooks after we returned. We opened the windows to fall asleep to the soothing sounds of nature. At sunrise, the light danced across our tiny home space creating an unbelievably spacious feel. The owners were so kind and we enjoyed sharing a little bit about each other and our passion for tiny homes. Do yourself a favor and enjoy a stay in this tiny home. There are multiple venues for breakfast, lunch, and dinner within minutes but this tiny home location is peaceful and off the beaten path if calm and mindfulness is a must."

We had a minor issue but Brett really went the extra mile to make things right for us and we really appreciate that. This is my wife and I's first time staying at a tiny home, but will definitely not be the last. We will absolutely be staying with them in the future. Brett is Definitely an asset to Airbnb. Wishing you many more years in the future with hosting. I've stayed in a lot of places before, but this is by far been my best experience. Thanks for a memorable and amazing trip."

The weather wasn't the best or I would have spent more time relaxing on the front porch or exploring the property but all around I would highly recommend staying here and would love to come back sometime!

Stayed one night","I’ve been wanting to stay in a tiny house for some time now. Brett’s place was indeed tiny but super cute. Upon arrival we had an unexpected welcome party of about 15-20 ladybugs inside, no fault of Brett. He offered to come right over & take care of them but we were able to use the vacuum provided to do a catch & release ourselves! We were not quite prepared for the paintball complex at the end of the gravel path near the home. So there was some noise from that & quite a bit of dust kicked up from the cars. But after closing time all was quiet. The shower was very small (think tiny house!) & the water pressure was really low. There was only one bath towel provided but we did have two wash cloths & a hand towel. There was coffee & essentials provided plus bottled water & some apples in the fridge. I can’t say a whole lot about the bed, just a mattress on the floor of the loft. Overall it was a neat overnight experience."

Stayed with kids","If if I could give 10 stars and 2 thumbs up, I would!
We had the absolute BEST time! Off the beaten path feel, with the convenience of being real close to town.
We always try to get out and explore while we stay away from home, and this was a great location for that! We are nature lovers, and boy did we get our fill! Deer, lizards, turtles, toads, frogs, a vast variety of birds, and the friendliest host chickens!!
If nature isn’t for you, I’d still highly recommend! Inside Tiny Blue is comfy and cute! Hop in your car and you’re 3 minutes from a gas station and 5 minutes from the bigger stores and restaurants.
We got the pleasure of touring the Tiny Homes that Brett is currently building, as well as the neighboring paint ball field (of which we never heard a noise from, which wouldn’t have bothered us a bit, but was still very nice!)
I could go on and on about the absolute pleasure we had staying here, and will definitely be back to stay again! Brett and Heather, thank you so much!"

The beauty of their property seems to be the perfect setting for the perfect tiny home. Our family was very comfortable for the night and grilled out. Heather has a beautiful garden next to the porch. For breakfast, Brett invited us up to gather some fresh eggs. Talk about amazing! And for those that really love tiny homes, Brett is a designer and builder. If you are lucky, he may give you a tour."

Stayed with kids","My husband, our two boys (ages 9,10) stayed and had an amazing experience. There was plenty of space although it is a tiny house, it was perfect. Room for board games, family TV and lounging, outdoor adventures. My sons were able to feed and pet chickens and told me they were living their best lives. It had a quiet, country feel outdoors but fully modern interior. Two lofts provided the perfect bedding set up. The mini toiletries were adorable! There is even a guide to local restaurants and more on tiny home living. Well-laid out design, comfortable, and we definitely hope to be able to return soon! A 5 out 5 stay, incredible! Exactly what we were looking for! Thank you!"

Stayed with kids","Awesome tiny house! It had everything we needed for a short stay. The property is back behind trees and is mostly private, you can just barely see the host's home between trees in the back. On the weekends it is noisy and some traffic since there is a paintball field/center across the way, but it did not disrupt us. We enjoyed the fire pit, feeding the chickens (made me feel right at home), a walk in the woods, and exploring old sheds from the original land owners was cool. It was 4 min from Walmart and many other local stores and amenities yet feels like you are in a remote property once back at the house! First time in a tiny house :)"

Stayed one night","Tiny Blue was a wonderful stay! My boyfriend and I only stayed for one night after a wedding but it was an adorable place and just like the pictures. They had board games and a binder filled with rules for games present in the yard as well as food suggestions. It was quite cold when we stayed in there but it was also 22 degrees fahrenheit the night we stayed! I would definitely recommend being comfortable with the people you stay with here as it would be difficult to change/get ready in the rest room but I would expect that with any tiny house. Overall, I really enjoyed the stay, the place was beautiful and wonderfully prepared for activities. It would be quite fun in the summer."

Brett was super accommodating with anything we needed or asked for ….He did a great job packing a lot of usable essentials into a small space. Even a small washer/dryer! If you haven’t tried tiny living and wonder what it’s like come for a stay…..we highly recommend"

Stayed with kids","Tiny Blue was just as described! The tiny house experience was fun for our family of 3. My 14 year old son loved having his own loft and ladder. Tiny living is surprisingly very functional and we enjoyed all the little nooks and crannies and storage. The front porch is wonderful and my son enjoyed sitting outside playing his guitar and singing. We were out and about most of our stay but Tiny Blue is conveniently located near Locust and the wedding venue we were at for our friends. We wish we would have had more down time to enjoy the hammock and other games in the deck box (definitely check those out). My son and fiancé did get to play horseshoes and feed the chickens which was great! Just some notes and not at all a negative reflection on this place because we would absolutely stay here again. There is a paintball place past Tiny Blue and traffic can get heavy at times early on Friday morning (my early is 9am) but there is no sound from the paintball place from inside the house. Be prepared to climb stairs and hunch over to get in the bigger loft area. This was not a problem for us as we are 5’3 and 5’6 but taller people should take note. If you sit up in the middle of the night you might hit your head on the ceiling. The only other thing is if you want to sleep late be aware the sun comes through the windows and there is really no way to block this out. For us, we had to be up early anyway. Brett was very kind and very quick to offer his assistance with anything we needed. He was very friendly during our communication and I wish we could have met in person! We will definitely be staying again when we come to visit our friends!"

The most surprising things were the full-sized fridge and shower. The host went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed during our stay and even gave us farm fresh eggs for the weekend! The tiny house is tucked away, so it's quiet with the only sound being the occasional car heading to the adjacent paintball field. I needed assistance getting the oven going, and Brett came over right away to replace the propane tank. We will definitely be staying here again!"

The kitchen is fully functional & everything looks brand new. The cottage also have plenty of activities to keep everyone entertained. Now my husband wants to book the place for a guys' weekend!

We relaxed to surround sound music. We ate food, built a bonfire, fished, walked around the lake, enjoyed the porch, swing and rocking chairs. We enjoyed nature, birds and the beautiful lake and fountain.

Group trip","We had a wonderful weekend. Our son's wedding was nearby on Saturday. Our family and the groomsmen stayed at the house. We hosted a rehearsal dinner the night before the wedding and it turned out great. The weather was perfect, and we used the porch for guests to eat dinner. The space worked great for our group of 30 guests, the kitchen was spacious and traffic flowed easily thanks to all the access points from the deck and kitchen. We decorated the beautiful porch with lots of fairy lights and flameless candles for some sparkle.
We had plenty of room for our group of 12. The view of the pond was a great backdrop to the weekend. Our sons had a great time fishing. We lit the firepit and enjoyed making smores. Jeffery was a wonderful host, he answered every question and provided lots of valuable information before our stay. He continued to be a great host even after we'd left as we forgot an important item. We give the location and the owners our highest recommendation"

Group trip",This was the perfect location for our wedding. We rented from Thursday-Sunday and had our wedding on Friday the 13th. We did not have to rent tables or chairs from an outside vendor because they have them for rent on site. Plenty of refrigerator space for the catering. I forgot my drink dispenser for tea and lemonade but they had more than enough party supplies if something is forgotten. The house didn’t feel like a rental it felt like a home we had been to 100x. The house was big enough for our wedding party to stay along with us. Every single wedding guest fell in love with the house and the pond and land was the perfect backdrop to our day. We will be back probably annually. Thank you guys for being amazing hosts!!

Jeffery and Betsy are wonderful hosts; they anticipate needs, provide excellent communication, and do it all in a friendly, easy going manner. The house and property are absolutely amazing. We had between 9-11 people staying during our time there, and we had plenty of room to spread out. We were celebrating my daughter's wedding and were able to host three wonderful events there--a family dinner (35 guests), and bridal brunch (14 guests), and the wedding reception (90 guests). Everyone commented on the excellent use of space in the house and the beautiful setting and grounds. I cannot thank Jeffery and Betsy enough for providing this wonderful home for use on Airbnb. We made memories to last a lifetime, and the bass pond was a huge hit with our high school boys!"

The beds were comfortable, and there were enough places to sit for everyone and areas to recede to, if desired. We loved playing games of pool and enjoying the pond area and trying to fish (the poles could use a little TLC). My dog enjoyed the freedom of the yard, and we enjoyed being able to have her there. Even though we didn't need it, they provided a big crate, which was very nice of them. We would definitely recommend this lovely, peaceful home."

You feel the joy that Jeffery and his family have infused into the property immediately upon arrival. Peaceful, tranquil, and beautiful. The amenities with the home are over and above what is usual in most Airbnb properties. A complete package. Jeffery is a superhost, and it shows. From communication, to delivery, Jeffery felt like a relative allowing you to use the property. We have many memories as my son's wedding was at Tuscan Ridge, and the location was fabulous! Just minutes from Tuscan Ridge, and all that the area has to offer. We already are planning a possible first anniversary celebration here. AND, it could be the perfect location on its own for any celebration with its built-in ability to host gatherings. What a pleasure to stay here. If Sam is mowing the yard while you are there, interrupt him for the homes history. We will be back!"

Stayed a few nights","Our family thoroughly enjoyed our stay! From the moment we got there we felt right at home. Checking in was easy. The house itself is absolutely beautiful and has everything you need. We have never stayed at a place that has a kitchen that has everything you could possibly need! We love to cook! There’s plenty of room to prepare your meals and tons of options for sitting down and enjoying your meal. Between the bar, dinning room, wrap around porch and backyard. The pool table and darts downstairs were a hit! The guys love playing cornhole so the fact they had boards was great! A couple fish were caught and released in the pond. Our overall favorite was the shaded backyard. It’s just so beautifully landscaped. We enjoyed s’mores at night around the huge fire pit.
Lasting Memories were made with family and friends. Our youngest daughter graduated high school on Friday evening and our middle daughter Married The Love of Her Life in an intimate ceremony on Saturday evening.

There is a Walmart about 20 minutes away, which is just far enough for the home to feel peaceful and away from everything but not totally removed.

If you have young children, they will have a blast. We brought a kite and got it up high in the field beside the pond. There are several types of flowers growing wild on the back side of the pond. We made a beautiful and colorful arrangement. My son took his niece for a small walk in the woods to hunt up fallen branches for the huge fire pit. We all enjoyed the hammock in the backyard. Great sound system that plays in the house and outside (when we arrived the music was on. It was a nice touch.) My kids kept saying the house felt so homey..

My family of 4 along with my brother in law and his family of 5, 2 grandparents and a Labradoodle spent the week at Jeff's house and it was wonderful. We enjoyed everything the house had to offer from the amazing fire pit to the many hours fishing on the pond, I also think my son and nephew put about 300 miles on the paddle boat. While the house is spacious, clean, and amazing we spent many hours on the beautiful porch chatting and enjoying the view. We had very few needs or requests but Jeff and Betsy were quick to reply to any questions we had. We used Walmart delivery for groceries and rarely ventured out. I would highly recommend this property to families large and small as it has so much to offer. We are already looking for a week next year to return. For those coming from out of town we also highly recommend Jay's Seafood which is about 15 minutes away, get there early."

Group trip","Here’s a review from another member of our family…
This is the second year our family has chosen Jeffrey’s place for our family reunion. This AirBnB has a charm that’s hard to resist. We love the wonderful shade trees. The long, deep porch that extends on three sides of the house was a perfect place for relaxing, reading, eating, and visiting.
The pond stocked with fish was a huge attraction. One young teen, who spent most of his waking hours at the pond, was still fishing the last few minutes before his family’s departure. The paddle boat (equipped with life jackets) was another major attraction. The chairs around the pond were a good way for parents to sit and watch their children.
The house itself is roomy and comfortable and beautifully clean.
The kitchen was spacious. The second refrigerator was especially nice with our big family.
Jeff and Becky were extremely accommodating, answering questions promptly and showing true Carolina hospitality.
Thanks to our wonderful hosts and their beautiful house, we had a fun, memory-making weekend."

The property is absolutely gorgeous, wit the best views from the back porch! In fact, we spend every meal, every cup of coffee, and every conversation on that porch! The setting is idyllic overlooking the pond, watching the bunnies romp under the shade of the trees...perfect place to relax!
The huge Firepit was another nice amenity. We all enjoyed a big bonfire (next to the pond) and sat around for hours chatting!
Jeffrey, the owner, was very communicative during our stay. We only had one question and he was quick to respond. The house is well organized, with every kitchen tool you may need.
If you’re looking for a beautiful home, for a large group, on a beautiful, tree filled site, this is your rental!"

Jeff & Betsy leave nothing to chance. They supply so many games and yard toys to entertain both yong and old alike. Perfect location for family events and gatherings both small and large.
It was well worth the drive from Pennsylvania to stay here!
Great value for the money!"

Jeff and Betsy were very responsive and willing to work with us on our stay every step of the way. From trivial questions about how things work in the house to offering recommendations of local amenities they were always quick as a whip to respond and seemed to have lo the answers. The place is huuuuuuge and very well kept. Plenty of room for activities from the bass pond to the pool table, yard games, board games and so much more. It’s quite difficult to find a reason to leave once you’re here."

You will not be disappointed!! We hope to come back again!! Jeffrey is a great host. He gave us a detailed layout of switches and how to work the fire place . He communicated before , during and after our visit. Many thanks for memories we will cherish always!!!!"

Stayed with kids","We rented this house for a combined thanksgiving gathering and our sons 1st birthday party. We could not have asked for a better host/house to make this the perfect long weekend. From the pond to the fire pit to the amazing accommodations we had room for everyone. The basement was perfect for the older kids to hang out And have their own retreat. The wrap around porch in the morning with a view of the pond and a hot cup of coffee was probably my favorite experience. Even the simple comfortable swing on the porch made for a wonderful place to sit and take in an early morning. The whole property was so peaceful, we will definitely consider this for an annual event.
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Group trip","We can not say enough about Jeff and Betsy's venue. It was absolutely perfect for our wedding!
Jeff allowed us to walk the property and tour the home before making a decision on reserving for our big day. We loved it so much we reserved the property that same day.
Leading up to the wedding Jeff was there to answer any questions we had with a fast response time. Before checking in Jeff gave us a full run down on the entire venue, guiding us with details to make our stay as seamless as possible. He arranged the rental for tables and chairs for the weekend, allowing one less thing for us to worry about.
The property was beautiful with plenty of room for us to hold our reception dinner (30 guests) and ceremony (60 guests). Venue could easily hold 150+ guests.
The home itself is very spacious. Our whole wedding party was able to stay comfortably. Plenty of bedrooms and bathrooms for everyone. The basement was a great space for the groomsmen to play pool and get ready, while bride and bridesmaids had the entire upstairs. The kitchen had everything we needed to prepare meals for the length of our stay. Wrap around porch was perfect for serving food and drinks. There seemed to be more amenities around every corner.
The backyard is huge. The trees give plenty of shade for a wedding even in the summer. The pond was a beautiful backdrop for the wedding and photos...as well as fishing! There were plenty of outdoor outlets for us to have additional lighting and to power our sound system for the wedding and reception.
We had the perfect wedding and the best weekend of our lives. We can not thank Jeff and Betsy enough. We never had an issue during our stay but had confidence knowing they were only a call away. We hope to rent this property again for more family/friend get togethers in the future."

Stayed over a week","This is a beautiful property with lots of room in the house and around it. The house has all the cool features including some fun activities, it’s very large, yet very cozy. We haven’t tried paddle boating or fishing but those is done here as well on the private bass pond! It would be awesome for a family trip and as you will see in the pictures it can accommodate quite a large group of people. I saved it for my future family vacation.
This time, we stayed here for mostly business for two weeks and we enjoyed the house and the property very much. We played some pool and games in the basement, walked around the pond, watched few movies by the fireplace, listened to some music outside and in the house through a nice speaker system Jeff had set up and had some wine on the porch watching sunset.
Check in and out is the easiest and Jeff sent us lots of helpful instructions about the house and the property. Everything is very easy and intuitive around the house. Easy access to garage, basement, washer drier, etc. Jeff is a great host and communication is timely and thorough.
This is a first class experience and lots of fun for family and friends. I would highly recommend Jeff’s place for any kind of travel. Can’t wait to come back!"

Stayed a few nights",Great place for a family getaway and host Scott was awesome in terms of communication. It's quiet place near the end of a cove so if you want peace. I recommend it. House was well set up to meet all needs and beds and bedding were much better than what we have at home. Going to need to fix that. The only suggestion I have as I mentioned to Scott. The best part of the house at least for us was the deck off the main-house. During our stay it was really hot and humid and that deck gets sun all day long so I would recommend bringing a couple fans to keep cool out there if you travel during extreme heat. All in we loved it. Nature abounds and we spent hours watching what I think we a pair of hawks or eagles nose dive into the water and grab fish. Some epic fights as they were going for some fish triple their size. The cove and house location are perfect for the 4 kayaks that come with the house. Great for kids as the water is only 2-3 feet.

I appreciate that he was very accommodating in my check-in and check-out. I had special circumstances and he worked with me to make sure I had a smooth check-in and check-out. Did I mention how clean the place is? Too bad our stay was short. I’d love to visit again in the summer time if there’s availability. Certainly on my list of places to return to. Thanks for being so generous Scott!"

Beds slept well and lots of nice towels. Tucked in a nice quiet creek on the lake. Perfect lake weekend getaway!"

The Kitchen and bathrooms are updated. The living has a large, comfy couch that is perfect for movie night and naps! The deck was great for sitting out enjoying early morning meditation and breakfast. We absolutely loved this space.
P.S.
If you are from out of town and fly in, please rent a car. Ubers and Lyfts are hard to get. You will have to reserve them in advance, which cost more."

Stayed with kids","When we submitted our request to book the question is asked “what is your travel for and brings you to the area.” I replied that my daughter and I were looking for a quiet get away where we could relax and enjoy a pool. The host, Carla, replied that she didn’t know if she could get the pool man there to get the pool serviced in time for our stay. I politely replied that we need to know if the pool was going to be available because we would revoke our request for stay for Friday, May 28th until Tuesday, June 1st. Carla (the host) replied that she would confirm that she could get the pool contractor there to service the pool. She then replied that she had schedule the pool service for Friday morning and they pool may not be available to be used on Friday and I informed her as long as it would be ready Saturday, May 29th because we would be getting the late evening Friday (after 10PM). Saturday morning I got up to go pick- up breakfast for my daughter and I saw 2 people out back. I went to the gate and introduced myself and Carla was very friendly and introduced me to Jericho - who she referred to as the handyman but it was obvious the more conversation we had that he is her partner/boyfriend as they referred to the house in Charlotte as “their home” I immediately noticed the pool was cloudy, murky (Jericho even used the word Algae to described the condition of the water). I expressed I was concerned about the condition of the pool and told them while in vacation with my husband once we stayed at a villa with a private pool and my husband got sick and we ended up at an urgent care where my husband was diagnosed with a “bacterial infection” that was attributed to infected water in a pool that was apparently not treated properly. Jericho said the ph level of the pool water was fine but the pool had not finished filtering to clean the water. This is Saturday. Carla took me on a tour of the main house and showed me some work they had done to improve the interior to establish 3 additional AirBNB suites inside the house. She also talked in great detail about a failed attempt last year to repair her injured keep and how the procedure had failed and she was now scheduled for a knee replacement. She also showed me the game room with pool table and movie theater in the basement ... telling me that Jericho knew how to play movies if we wanted to watch a movie. They also told be about a couple of activities we might want to try: visiting a strawberry farm and going to the drive in movie (but not mention of any of the things I had provided in writing in my request to book the reservation) In my request to book it asked what kind of activities you were looking to check out or visit during our stay. She told me in our communication in response to the information I provided that she would look into those things I requested so she could be a good host and provide us with information about specific things we were interested in. I noticed when reading other reviews when searching for a place to visit and stay that other reviews write beaming reviews about their host being very helpful in providing information about local activities. Aside from the strawberry farm (which we drive 25 minutes out to and it was closed) and the drive-in there were no specifics given for the other activities I submitted in writing and requested information on. They (Carla and Jericho) we very hospitable none the less and told us they were cooking out that afternoon and having a few neighbors and had family coming in town to stay at the AirBNB rooms inside the house. We asked what we could bring and we brought a couple of things for the cook out. My daughter and I rested part of the day in the cottage but were unable to watch reliable, uninterrupted tv because they only have streaming service and apparently their internet is not sufficient to accommodate the cottage which I made Carla aware of 3 times during our stay. In the afternoon my daughter was excited about going to the pool which is steps from the cottage but when we went over there I was extremely concerned about the condition of the cloudy and algae filled pool. This is when Jericho assured us that the ph level was fine and the pool had been treated but had just not had time to filter and clear up. Against my better judgement and at my daughter’s strong insistence I let her hesitantly let her in the pool. She didn’t stay but about 15 minutes and immediately wanted to get out and go shower. She said the pool was filthy. There were loose tools in the bottom of the pool that could not been seen through the cloudy water that Jericho warned her about and the attachments she found she got out of the pool. It got cooler and we went back to the cottage after we are and got dressed for bed to try to watch TV but the streaming would not work so we watched TV on our phone. Friday night we got in very late (like 12:30AM with the remote access to get into the cottage) so I slept pretty good because we had been moving earlier in the week and were just tired and wanted to relax and enjoy resting, watching TV and swimming. This brings be to the king sized bed in the upstairs bedroom. It was the most uncomfortable bed! The cottage itself was very clean (except no hand soap in kitchen and at upstairs bath sink) and the main house on the..."

Only missed counter space in the bathrooms, but was able to manage around it. Overall, highly recommend. It was about 18 minutes from the Stanly Civic Center, which was the venue we were visiting."

Stayed a few nights","Amanda’s place was perfect for us! It was just a short drive from our son’s home in Mount Gilead. Her home was extremely clean, probably one of the cleanest we’ve visited. I was impressed by how clean the refrigerator was! Our grandchildren played in the fenced back yard. They also fished off the dock, and my husband caught two large sunfish which we didn’t keep, but did get great bragging pictures. Amanda had children’s toys inside which came in handy one day when fishing ended earlier than planned. The lake view is awesome from the living room, our favorite place in the mornings. Amanda responded very quickly to questions we asked. The beds were very comfortable. Bed and bath linens were also nicely presented and pleasing to the eye upon entering those rooms. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! Our son and his family enjoyed the couple of times they visited. We visit the area at least once a year and think we’ve found our “go to” place on the lake for future visits."

Stayed a few nights","Rick and Shirley were outstanding hosts. They're friendly, responsive, and right next door if needed - which made me feel safe. Their property is a beautiful and well maintained little cottage quite near downtown Albemarle but on an extremely quiet street. Highly recommend both the property and the area for a fun getaway or work trip. It has all the amenities of home as well as being comfortable, very clean, and thoughtfully decorated."

Stayed a few nights",What a gem! Richard and Shirley have a beautiful slice of paradise in Albemarle and it is easy to get to most things in town. I really appreciated the lovely tropical landscaped yard with giant floofy banana trees. Richard was also very helpful and offered to shuttle me into Concord when the Hertz EV rental car turned into a disaster. The cottage is adorable and had everything I needed during my stay and I hope to bring my husband back when he travels with me next time. Thank you for being such gracious hosts!

Stayed with kids","What a wonderful hidden gem! My son and I were looking for a decently priced place to stay NASCAR/Memorial Day weekend and we found this place available! This was my son's first Air B-N-B experience and he was quite impressed! We loved the decorations of what looks like items from places they have visited. I requested to check in a little earlier so we could attend the NASCAR festivities and they offered for us to check in 30 minutes earlier than I requested so my son could enjoy the experience longer! Unfortunately, due to the rainy weather we did not attend. But we did spend hours inside playing board games. My son and I loved how we felt like we were playing at our own house. We couldn't have chosen a better place to spend the evening inside."

The place was full of charm and character, spotlessly clean, and with ample supplies of conveniences for the kitchen, bathroom and bedrooms.
The shower was one of the best we’ve ever had with an extra large head, amazingly water pressure and ample supply of hot water!
The garden was picturesque and both us and our little dog liked to spend time in it. We also couldn’t have asked for a better location as it is close to a few of our favourite restaurants as well as a very short drive to Morrow Mountain.
Both the cottage and our hosts were wonderful and we highly recommend it. Thank you!"

Plenty of seating in the living room to stretch out after a long day. TV with quite a few viewing choices. House rules posted on the refrigerator in clear view for easy reference."

Stayed a few nights","Very cute and clean house. House is located on a very quiet street, which is great for sleeping late and privacy. Kitchen was well stocked and had everything we needed. The home owners were having some major construction done to their private home which is located next door, so there was a ton of trucks and workers there the entire time but was pleasantly surprised that the noise did not disturb us at all. My only complaint was that the house had several air fresheners and I’m very sensitive to scents. I did remove them from the house and put them outside while we were there. This is just a personal thing for me because strong smells like that bring on migraines for me and that’s not a fin thing at all. With that being said, I didn’t have any migraine issues since I removed the air fresheners and would definitely stay again but would ask for them to be removed prior to my arrival."

Stayed a few nights","I can’t say enough hood things about Rick and Shirley and this beautiful property. The Meditation Station is a cozy, beautifully renovated bungalow with a large well manicured backyard. All of the features in the house are above average. The kitchen is very clean with stainless Steele appliances. The tile work in the bathroom is beautiful and modern. The hardwood floors have been restored to a high gloss. But the features that really stand out are all of the interior decoration. Art and artifacts from Southeast Asia combined with Persian style carpets and bright modern paintings create an exceptional space. The beds are comfy. The furniture is new and clean. The Linen and towels are high quality. There’s even a well stocked first aid kit in the bathroom. Everything is very thoughtful and designed for comfort.
Rick and Shirley are right next door and really friendly interesting folks. I had several nice conversations with Rick. They were also very accommodating to my dog. This is one of the nicest properties I’ve ever stayed at."

Beyond curating a beautifully decorated, highly functional, and incredibly cozy home, he took it upon himself to make sure we were safe, comfortable, and above all... had peace of mind. In an age where the world is so seemingly bleak, Rick offered a light that could surely outshine the sun. Words will never be able to encompass the gratitude that will live in our hearts, forever."

If you're trying to escape from the clutter and noise of everyday routine, this is definitely the place. We sat out one night and watched the meteors and listened to the frogs...it was great! There was no light pollution and road noise. The location is only 10-15 minutes from restaurants and stores but the suite was so well stocked we didn't need to go to the store.

AIRB&B: In the category of “buyer, beware,” it is important to understand that Airbnb fees and costs are expensive enough to double the published price of this place. But that is true no matter where I have stayed with Airbnb. Back to this place and this host: This is a wonderful place to stay. As a woman traveling alone, I have never felt so secure and comfortable in my travels back-and-forth to be with my family. So much better than any hotel!"

We so enjoyed our stay, and felt right at home. The suite is beyond neat and clean. There isn't one negative to discuss, we only wished we spent more time there. My husband and I were in town to visit friends so we weren't there too often. But when we were there, we were definitely feeling like we were welcome and at home.

Stayed a few nights","Perfect! This place is the most comfortable airbnb I’ve ever stayed in! The bathroom and tub and closet are huge and have everything you could want, the bed is really comfortable, they have really interesting books about the history of the area, it’s great! It’s secluded from most things to do but the roads are fun so I didn’t mind at all!"

Stayed a few nights","The explanation of Long Creeks suite was perfectly in depth and accurate! From knowing exactly where to park and having everything we needed (and more!) simply organized and accessible in our super clean suite up on arrival made us feel very welcome and at home. We hardly ever heard our hosts and communication was very easy!
The suite size was perfect for my husband and I when we settled in after a day out and about. There was no table to eat our carry out but we're used to that at home so we didn't look around to see if there was one in a closet. We managed perfectly fine. The bottled water, coffee maker and breakfast options were a welcome treat!! And the mini refrigerator stored everything we needed it to! The bathroom's double vanity was enough to make me want to move on permanently and the shower stall size was so spacious! What a bathroom!! The bed was cloudlike and comfortable! Plenty of fastfood and pizza options close by, CVS, Food Lion, terrific coffee shop and a bar all down the street and within a few minutes drive.
Great accomodations!!"

Rick communicated on a daily basis to ensure we had everything we needed. The suite is immaculate and the furnishings are in very good condition and very comfortable. There are books and games plenty if you just want to stay in and relax. The bathroom is amazing - you have to visit for yourself to understand what I am conveying! The bed and was so comfortable and linens aplenty. There is not a cooking kitchen however, there is a microwave, Keurig coffee maker and a small refrigerator. The surrounding property is so beautiful - rolling hills with woods and a creek - and don't overlook the family goat and plenty of birds to watch at the feeders. If you are looking for a quiet and relaxing home away from home, this is the place for you."

The location is away from the big city hustle and bustle but still convenient to the Charlotte metropolitan area. Our first day we road over to Pilot Mountain then on to Mt. Airy just north of Winston Salem. Our second day we attended church then went over to the Gold Hill community for a fabulous lunch at Momma T’s, then touring around the shops in the beautiful old village. Communication was great. Rick was available should we needed anything, but we felt like we had all the privacy we needed. Foodlion, Bojangles, and other stores were a convenient drive to the town of Richfield. Rick’s place is a great value and I hope to get the opportunity to stay again sometime."

Stayed a few nights","Our stay with Rick and Donna was outstanding!
My family lives throughout Stanley County and until this year we had always stayed in a guestroom of my cousins house. Well our guest room has been turned into a nursery for the sweetest little blessing- which meant we were sleeping on the floor or we needed to find a good place to stay.
Enter Rick and Donna's place! What a find!
From the moment I contacted/booked with Rick and we received an email back, I KNEW this was the place for us. Rick was so helpful, personable, receptive and welcoming.
The suite is B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L! Lovely decor, very inviting and relaxing. The bed and pillows are so incredibly comfortable that each night we were asleep within moments of our heads hitting the pillows.
The bathroom is enormous with double sinks, a vanity where I could sit and do my hair and makeup as well as a lovely jetted shower and large sunken jet tub (which I didn't get a chance to use but maybe next time!)
I was impressed with their walk-in closet which held extra linens and bedding as well as an iron and an ironing board and a full length mirror. I also noticed that the house was so quiet you couldn't tell anyone else was even there; it was really its own private suite!
Rick and Donna have a Keurig machine and a miniature refrigerator and each morning we would have some fruit and some coffee before hitting the road for our jam packed days with our family.
It was so nice to know that at the end of each day we were going back to a spotless, safe, quiet, inviting home to rest and recharge.
Our ONLY Complaint is that we could not stay longer.
We cannot wait to go back and have already started to make tentative plans for September. This is for sure our new ""home away from home"" when we are in the area.
P.S. We got to meet Chewy the goat who is super sweet and talkative and likes his head scratched - just mind the wire fence!"

I sent Rick a note at 6:30am and had a response by 7:00am. I booked the plane tickets and Ricks place by &7:30am and was in NC by 2:30 pm that day. We arrived after the first baseball game very late at night. We were blown away by how nice it was inside. You have to remember we arrived at midnight. The 3 rooms were spotless ! The bathroom is huge with every amenity. SUPER SUPER CLEAN ! The bedroom was great as well. The bed was so comfortable my wife set out on a mission to get the same topper for our bed at home. The bedroom was large, clean and very spacious. There was also a sitting room with a love seat (again very clean) with a small frig & coffee maker with some breakfast snacks. The rooms are attached to the house but completely separate. The locking system for the door was simple and easy to use. We arrived very late at night and no issues. The next morning I walked the property and found it was extremely well kept. By the pictures & review this place BEAT our expectations. IF our son plays baseball next for the copperheads we will be back without question. You positively cannot go wrong staying here. You will not find a better place to stay in 100 miles."

We especially appreciated the things like make-up remover wipes, coffee, snacks, and an iron/ironing board. We stayed here before our friends wedding and loved the quiet area. I highly recommend the donut dinette for breakfast or New Sarum brewery for beers and live music!"

The bathroom has everything you could ever want, my wife said, “Bathroom Goals!”. The location is quiet, gorgeous, and very serene. Rick and Donna made sure we had everything we needed, very courteous and just great people in general! We will definitely be back!!

There's honestly not any room for improvement as everything is obviously carefully considered and well executed, from layout and decor to fantastic pillows and choice of snacks & coffee. The area itself is quite rural but doesn't feel too far away from larger surrounding towns. I would heartily recommend Long Creek Inn to anyone traveling in the area. I can't imagine opting to stay in a hotel when there's a place like this available."

The space is plenty big for two people and it’s very inviting. My favorite things were the luxurious jetted tub, the most comfortable bed I’ve slept on & of course Chewy the goat! The creek is also a nice relaxing place to zen out. Without question I would recommend their suite for a stay and without a doubt if I’m in the area again I hope to get lucky enough for another stay. The only thing that I missed and would suggest to them is a microwave. Great people & great stay!"

Love the decor, cozy bed and oversized bathroom w/ his & her sinks and jacuzzi tub!
“Chewy”, the persnickity personality of the estate’s goat, made it a challenge of finding a treat to her liking! She has discrimminating tastes!"
