Group trip","Lori is a very responsive host and as sweet as can be. The cabin was spotless, and I appreciate that! I spilled some water in the kitchen when we got there and wiped it up with a paper towel. There wasn’t one spec of dirt on that paper towel! The beds were comfy with lovely quilts. She has a great gas/stove & oven, a microwave, and a toaster-type oven perfect for cooking big breakfasts. My favorite part, though, was hanging out and grilling on the amazing outside deck in the back. Such beautiful nature all around, and so peaceful. I loved enjoying my morning coffee there as well. Bring a few camp chairs for the deck. Lori also gifts you a homemade delicious cinnamon coffee cake. Thanks, Lori! We will be back!"

Stayed a few nights","This campground is magnificent and the host is incredible from the coffee cake to the nicely decorated accommodations. The creativity and talent that went into making the Big Barn special is magical. Our family felt “at home” and it helped us remember our grandparent’s heritage. The grounds are beautifully kept and the kids had fun catching fish at the pond. The four rooms were awesome with comfy beds, and lots of hot water, a nice sized refrigerator which accommodated all the food we had for our reunion. Thanks for a wonderful time Lori!!!"

Stayed with kids","We stayed at the Big Barn and this place was amazing. We didn’t rent it for the event space but Lori had no issues with us using it if the weather was bad due to our event being outside. Everything was described as is and Lori is an excellent host. I love all of the personal touches, from the bottles of water in each room to the delicious homemade cinnamon coffee cake that she leaves in each cabin. There was also extra cabins to rent which came in handy because we had one more coming and didn’t have the space in the barn. If you are in town and need a place to stay or an event place this is it!! Again an amazing stay. Thank you Lori for being such a wonderful host and allowing us to enjoy your space. We will see you again next year."

Group trip","Our stay at the Big Barn in Deridder was very enjoyable. We loved the entire place. it was actually better than we expected. From the beautiful lighting to the attention to details in each room, we were blown away. There were a lot of extras such as rocking chairs, Green Egg smoker, large barbeque pit, outdoor rocker swing and outdoor cooler for drinks. The whole area was unique with different themes for the other cabins. There were cement sidewalks for walking around the campground and bridges over the pond. Our host, Lori, checked on us several times to make sure we had everything we needed. It was a very pleasant experience. I would highly recommend it!"

Stayed with kids","The barn is beautiful!! The pictures do not do it justice. It has such a comfortable inviting feel to it. Everything was clean & had a wonderful smell to it. Floor to ceiling windows in the front and a large window in the back.
Stall 1 & 2 are just bedrooms. Stall 3 has a 1/2 bath in it. Stall 4 has a full bath in it. There are two additional large bathrooms coming off the main living area. Cold blowing air conditioning!! Two big central units for the main area (& ceiling fans) and then each bedroom has a window unit in it. Perfect for the hotter months.
The campground is lovely. There is a play area for the children & a pond with ducks in it. It was neat just to walk around and see how they have everything displayed.
Our host Lori was attentive and made sure we had everything we needed.
My one complaint is that we didn’t have more time to spend here."

Stayed one night","The Big Barn is amazing and so is Lori. My husbands family used this place for a Christmas gathering and I loved it so much. I booked it for my son’s high school graduation party and it was absolutely perfect. It is big and open, perfectly decorated. The attention to all the little details are just perfect. The scenery around it, just the whole way their little campground was put together is beautiful and our little town is blessed to have this place. Lori is amazing. Not only was she quick to respond and answer all of my questions. She was a joy to just talk and communicate with. I had really great visits with her through messages on here and I got to see her when I checked in. It’s one of those places you’re sad to leave because it’s just so comfortable and peaceful. Thank you Lori for the best location for the best graduation party for my son. Everyone loved it."

This was the most peaceful campground to stay at that was far from the wedding venue. When we first arrived, Lori greeted us as she was doing her final walk thru inspection, Lori was such a sweet charming lady. We loved the old vintage decor, reminded us of Cracker Barrel ❤️
We loved the story Lori told us of how her husband transformed the big cabin. The campground was really a peaceful place. We would love to go back and stay in all the different cabins available. We really enjoyed our stay.
P.S. We also enjoyed the homemade cinnamon loaf cake Lori made for us, it was delicious!!"

Went on a business trip and chose to stay here with some colleagues instead of a hotel and we can't wait to go back and host our own private event there. While inside the big barn, we were like kids looking at so many neat details on the decoration of this place. Strolling around the property looking at the other buildings just made our minds run wild thinking about how great would be to have the entire property for a big family and friends' reunion.

Stayed a few nights","Katelyn was a joy to work with! The Airbnb was perfect for what we needed for our stay. Very cute Airbnb and well stocked.
The house does have central air but Katelyn provides window units in all 2 of the 3 bedrooms and the living room. Which is nice for how hot it gets in Louisiana but the window units did put off a moldy smell and the living room filter was very dirty. I was able to clean the filter and put it back but the whole unit was covered in dirt/mold/dust and it left our house smelling musty. The unit does not have a TV, which is listed in the description but I overlooked that detail. It would have been nice to have a tv to watch in the mornings or at night time. Which these are all smalls things, just things we noticed. Overall, our stay was nice and comfortable. Katelyn is very accommodating. Very welcoming!"

Stayed about a week","We stayed here for a week. The home was very cozy with comfortable beds and lovely linens. The neighborhood was extremely peaceful with lots of trees. You’d never know you were close to town and yet a park, shopping and restaurants were all less than 2-5 minutes away. The neighborhood, as well as the town, made me feel comfortable and safe. I went out alone several times after dark and felt completely secure in doing so. Katelyn was not only super responsive but also very friendly and easy to communicate with. She gives clear instructions for check in, WiFi access and check out but she also posts them in the home which was very convenient and helpful! She and her husband are available 24/7 and make sure you have numbers to reach them if needed. The kitchen has pretty much anything you’d need to make meals including several small appliances. The snack basket was a nice treat but my favorite thing was the homemade bar of soap! It smells amazing! Thank you for being such a great hostess!"

It has super comfy beds, lovely linens, plush pillows, and soft towels. The house was spotless. So many nice touches, including a gift of homemade soap and a heartfelt message on the chalkboard upon arrival as we were visiting after losing my husband’s brother in Dry Creek. We have a small Dry Creek home damaged in the freeze, so we hope to return and stay during renovation. I can see why this home stays booked. You can’t go wrong with this rental. We were only there one night, but I could see us being comfortable for an extended stay. Thanks, Katelyn, for your hospitality and very reasonable rental fee during a tough time."

The place was near my residence and the location was excellent. My Pastor, was actually able to go on the back porch and study which he said was very quiet and a great spot for him to meditate on his message. They were very pleased and said the bed was extremely comfortable. Katelyn was a great host and met all of our needs. I will definitely use this establishment again. If you stay at this place you will not be disappointed. It is also close to restaurants and stores. Thank you Katelyn! My rating is a 10 out of 10!

However, this time my guest were attending a wedding and the Groom was staying there. He had out of town childhood friends drop in to visit on Friday and Saturday night, although it was not a party the neighbors was looking at the cars. We personally talked to neighbors and they said it was not an issue with people stopping by but I guess it became a problem. However, Gin and I communicated very well and we got through the weekend with no issues. I definitely would recommend this place if you are looking for a nice, cozy place to bring your family."

The kitchen is stocked with pots and pans, there's a separate dining room, fenced yard, and a desk/office area. It's an older home, but well cared for. I'm an AirB&B host and EXTREMELY picky, but I was pleasantly surprised by how nice this house is!
The best part is Gin herself. She sincerely cares about hosting and takes her work very seriously. She is easy to communicate with, and even when we had a last-minute change to our reservation, she happily accommodated us. We also received a hand-written welcome note and delicious cookies at our arrival. Gin's place made our Thanksgiving so much more comfortable!"

Stayed with kids","This was the perfect choice for my trip to Deridder! Home was exactly as described. Gin provided everything possible to make us feel welcome and comfortable -- including a personalized welcome and baked treats! The plastic ""left over"" containers and baggies were appreciated; most Air B&Bs do not provide those and they are a necessity when eating out or cooking in.
The games and toys were a big PLUS for the kids. The recliners were a big PLUS for the adults.
The neighborhood was nice, the neighbors were pleasant to visit with, the yard was nice to sit in and for the kids to play in (grass nicely mowed and area was bug free).
Highly recommend this home when traveling to the area."

Stayed a few nights","Gin's Guest House in Deridder is one of the best homes we've ever experienced through Airbnb. She's provided a reasonably priced house that is immaculate, attractive, and very well-appointed. The house has been stocked with numerous thoughtful touches, some practical and some purely aesthetic, and all very much appreciated. The wi-fi worked very well. I didn't test it, but we obviously had a very fast connection. I'm always looking for houses with a recliner because I sleep better on one. Gin's Guest House has four in the living room! I was thrilled. Yes, I only used one, but the other three looked just as comfortable. I slept very well, by the way. The spouse said her bed was wonderful as well. The house is in a nice quiet neighborhood within five or ten (usually just five for us) minutes or so to just about any place you'd care to drive to in Deridder. Do note, as some other reviews have pointed out, that there isn't a TV in the house. If you have to have one, this isn't your Airbnb solution. Spouse and I don't go on trips to watch TV so we didn't expect or miss one. We did, for the first time ever in an Airbnb home, play some rousing games of Sorry, using one of the games in the sun room. I loved the desk setup in the sun room for my laptop. I could go on and on. This is just a really nice house that provided all we could reasonably want in an Airbnb. If we get back over to Deridder, we'll definitely be wanting to stay here again."

The neighborhood is so quiet, the location is perfect and the hostess is so helpful and makes everything so easy. Gin was always available to answer any questions and went above and beyond any other Airbnb has done. Upon arrival we were taken back at how relaxing the atmosphere was, the hospitality of snacks, coffee and everything you could possibly need. The house is beautiful and the decor is amazing. The price was very affordable!! I would definitely stay again in the future over any hotel room in the area for the price!"

It's been newly renovated, incredibly clean and has quality linens - even multiple bed pillows for different firmness levels. Everything is clearly labeled for ease of use (cabinet contents, light switches, etc.) and it has a very well stocked kitchen. Our communication with Gin was perfect and her special welcomes, including home baked breads, were so appreciated. I can absolutely say, if this fits your group's needs, this is a superior experience and value versus local hotels (I've now done both). Many thanks for our good experience!"

We had everything that we needed during our stay. The host has even put labels on every cabinet/drawer so you don't have to search for things. The beds were comfortable and the neighborhood was very quiet. The only con I saw was there is no TV in the home. This didn't affect our stay but if you have children you may want to bring a laptop/iPad so that they can watch videos. There is good WiFi there for that purpose."

Lots of labels on things, bottled water in fridge and snacks on the counter, a Keurig with lots of options. Nice size shower in master bathroom. In fair weather the back lawn is perfect for grilling or relaxing and the small table in the carport is ideal for morning coffee. It is just as pictured or even better! Without a doubt this home is worth staying at!- Marianne"

Upon entering it was exceptionally clean and every room smelled amazing. Comfy beds, hot water, plenty of amenities. Check in was very easy and hosts were quick to communicate and answer questions.
This Airbnb also felt home-y without feeling like you were actually in someones house. It felt more like a luxury suite in a five star hotel. Perfectly decorated and everything was so cozy."

Stayed a few nights","our first time staying here and it was not terrible.. but we wish we would’ve known some things before hand. You aren’t allowed to flush any toilet paper down the toilet, you have to turn off all heaters to use the microwave, it is hard to get any signal, even with the hotspot, you need to take out your own trash, which, by all means is a norm for us on the daily, but we have not gotten asked of this at any hotel or airbnb we’ve stayed at.. all of which was not included in the description and stay here. also be prepared to hear vehicles from the road and any other activity outside.
overall our trip was ok. host was nice. just glad I had someone with me to make the time fun."

Coffee pot and coffee, refrigerator, griddle, farm fresh eggs and fresh milk from a local dairy, a lounging deck with grill and patio furniture, darling little 1 bedroom-1 bath guest house with a very homey feel, luxurious fluffy bathrobes and slippers, cutest doggies that greeted me when I arrived (got a kick out of watching them play in the sprinklers). It was very clean, and smelled so fresh... It is decorated so cute... I told her when I first got there and looked around.... I thought, ""We could be friends... "" I am a single woman, and I felt very safe here. This place checked all the boxes.... What a hidden gem :) I highly recommend!!! If you want to feel warm, safe, comfortable, peaceful, and well rested... This is your place!!! I will be back :)"

Stayed a few nights","First off, the photos of the house only do so much. When i walked in the house and saw how beautiful the house was, i felt like i was in barbie’s dream house. Everything in the house was perfect. The beds were so comfortable and the kitchen is priceless. Staying in her Airbnb made my whole trip worth it all! Everything fell into place and it was amazing. I will be back in another two months and i will most definitely be staying here again. Once again Monya, thank you so much for opening your beautiful home up to us! You are an amazing beautiful women !"

There were a couple good coffee shops, and a great restaurant, Cecil‘s Cajun Café, which you should try if you’re dining out!! The hosts were very responsive and the beds were super-comfortable, which made for a great stay, because we had late nights out at the camp and got great rest! We would definitely recommend Carol’s place, and would stay here again!"

I didnt see any straws lol. Yea, its that good. Now its possible i overlooked them lol. There was not a speck of dust or a crumb anywhere to be found. If yku are thinking about this property, i promise you wont be disappointed. Jump on this asap because im sure this property will stay booked.

Stayed with kids","Christy's place wholeheartedly deserves a five star review! I don't know where to begin! It is exactly as described, plus some! This is the best AirBnB I have ever had the pleasure of staying in. I am very observant of cleanliness and there was not a corner or a spot untouched or uncleaned in this property. There were even little toiletries laid out in the bathroom drawers, much more than what is expected - mints, facial wipes, etc.! My children loved the large yard to run around in, and I loved the quietness and privacy! We were even visited by the roosters! Everything I needed was in the home, and Christy was always responsive and helpful. The furniture is clean and comfortable. We loved that there was no TV. My children played with each other and enjoyed the children's books and played with toys. The adults talked and enjoyed the solitude. Do not hesitate AT ALL if you are in the area and need a place to stay. We will stay again when we are back in Louisiana!"

The attention to detail was amazing from the decor to well stocked kitchen including snacks and coffee bar, and bathroom accessories. It was easy to find and located in a safe country setting a few minutes from town. Christy had a quick response time and left great instructions. Cabinets and light switches were clearly marked. It was easy to find and check in. The pictures accurately portray the cottage and yard but the peaceful atmosphere and special efforts put forth from these host can’t be captured by photos.

Stayed a few nights","I was blown away by the thoughtfulness of Christy’s hospitality! Not only does the cottage have everything you need (and more), it served as a relaxing base for my family. If you’re in deridder, you need to stay here! We loved sitting under the carport, spending time together and my son loved running around in their HUGE yard. Cannot recommend enough! Thank you Christy!!"

Stayed a few nights","Nana’s Cottage was awesome. It’s a really special quiet place. I thought the best amenity was NO TV! Something families could use these days…time together. There were lots of games for family fun, comfy chairs for reading a book and a small outside sitting area for nature watching or morning coffee."

Stayed with kids","Our family enjoyed our stay at Nana’s Cottage!
The house was so clean, beautifully decorated, and had everything you could need. From the snacks and coffee to the bubble bath, we were constantly impressed with the thoughtfulness and love that Christy poured into this home.
We couldn’t have imagined a better Airbnb and we haven’t stopped talking about it since we left!!
Thank you so much for everything, Christy!"

Stayed one night","Christy's place was clean, quiet and really cozy. She left snacks on the bar, candy on the table and water and juice in the fridge. The coffee on the coffee bar helped in the morning because I forgot to get some.
The walk in shower was amazing, as well as, the jacuzzi tub in the other bathroom. She has the best towels.
I was a bit surprised that there wasn't a TV or a radio in the house but it turned out well because my significant other and I actually got to conversate.
I would definitely stay here again and plan to when I'm back down that way. Thanks again Christy."

We loved every aspect of it and the little details Christy created made the experience homey and luxurious at the same time. My husband and girls didn't want to go back home it was that relaxing and peaceful. Christy is a one of a kind hostess
