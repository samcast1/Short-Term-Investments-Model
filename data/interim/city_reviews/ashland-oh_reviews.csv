Stayed a few nights","Barb and Jim,
My sisters and I can't thank you enough for the hospitality you showed us on our recent stay in your beautiful Century Farmhouse. You both made us feel so welcome and comfortable from the start with your kindness and warm way. The Farmhouse was a home away from home, very much like the home and surroundings where we all grew up. We cooked big dinners, and laughed until it hurt. We created memories that will last a lifetime, spending time with our Aunt, cousins and their children will be forever cherished.
We loved the comfort of your beautifully maintained and updated Century Farmhouse.
We already spoke of planning another stay next spring on our drive home to the eastern end of Long Island, NY.
My sisters and I are so grateful to you both for making our stay so special!
Thank you again,
Marian, Florence, Nancy and Gail"

Group trip","Our weekend stay at Jim and Barb's Century Farmhouse was wonderful. It was a beautiful setting and perfect location for us to gather with extended family, to attend a family reunion nearby. We had 6 adults and 2 children, and had plenty of space and amenities for all of us to enjoy and be comfortable. Barb met us upon arrival, and was beyond friendly and helpful in showing us the house and explaining everything. She was very responsive with positive communication before, during, and after our visit. I've previously stayed in numerous Airbnbs, and this was the cleanest and most beautiful property that I've been at. The kitchen and bathroom were stocked with extra items (more than mentioned in the listing), so we had plenty of what was needed, and more. The Chandlers are very gracious hosts, and we were pleasantly surprised with a delicious treat of homemade coffee cake. Thank you so much for allowing us to enjoy your special retreat."

We will book this home again for sure!"

There is a sense of peace when you drive up to the property with its stately trees. The kitchen is fully equipped (even a crockpot) and ready to be used. We were in need of some night lights and they quickly came to our rescue. They also shared with us suggestions of restaurants close by. The beds were comfortable, there was plenty of lighting and the temperature in the house was evenly regulated. We had plenty of towels and each bed had an extra blanket. What’s not to like! Definitely an A+ In our book."

Stayed with kids","Barb is a wonderful host who responds promptly and goes above and beyond to make her guests feel at home. We were greeted with a nice touch, but I won't spoil the surprise. Let's just say it really hit the spot!
We had an unusual situation with a surprise cancellation at another host's property which required a sudden booking at the Century House. Barb helped us deal with the logistics issues inherent in people coming in from 3 different cities. She might not think she did much, but she really helped to put us at ease as we dealt with all of the challenges we had with our trip.
My wife and I noticed her other mid-century home listing and we're already talking about possibly staying there in the future for another little getaway from the big city."

The house and property are immaculate and the owner's attention to detail is simply outstanding! The house had all the amenities you could possibly need and she even gave us a quick tour to explain the history of the house and how much work they've put into it. Barb was very kind and hospitable and quick to respond to messages. She truly deserves the title of ""super host""! The house is also in a great location. It's only a few miles from a cute downtown area and other local attractions. We enjoyed our stay so much that we are already planning our trip back next year. I highly recommend anyone to stay with Barb and don't forget to say hi to the chickens and cattle!!"

We went snow tubing at Snow Trails, went to Lehman’s store which we loved (they have everything there), the Smuckers Store was not far and very cute, Grandpa Cheese Barn is close and amazing, Sweeties Chocolates is right next door with delicious chocolates, Beyond Measure Market has great Fry Pies, and a couple of us went to see where the Shawshank Redemption was filmed at the Ohio State Reformatory Museum. I can not wait to come back in the summer or fall and sit on the front porch swing! And I will be back for sure! Best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at! Just loved it so much! Thank you Barb and Jim!"

There are two great parks for walking/running a few minute drive away, we got a fascinating tour of Jim's small-scale cattle operation, and enjoyed the best coffee cake I've ever had as a welcome gift from Barb. This was one of my best AirBnB experiences ever."

Group trip","The was the best airbnb experience I have ever had. Barb was very kind and welcoming and supplied extra goods for our stay. The place was beautiful and cozy. The pictures do not do the house justice. If you're considering this location, I highly recommend it. We had a very large group and everyone was shocked by how nice the place was and how well it suited a large group. Also, Barb responds fast which is fantastic for figuring out plans. The place has everything you will need and makes the stay that much easier. Have fun with your stay here!"

Barb was incredibly receptive to questions and requests, and added the sweet extra touch of baking for us before we arrived. The house was remodeled beautifully - keeping some of the touches of the old, with an overall new farmhouse feel. And the spaces were quite large and fit our families well - both inside and outside."

Stayed a few nights","Pre-stay: Barb was easy to work with, quick to reply, and accommodating in every way.

Stay: The Century House was so nice - cozy with character and charm. We could tell Jim was proud of the work he did to restore the home, and rightly so. It was lovely to stay in a home with history AND all the modern conveniences! It was private, but the hosts were accessible for anything we needed. We enjoyed talking to Jim about the farm while he was at the barn, but he was never intrusive.

Barb and Jim clearly put a lot of thought into making this a welcoming and comfortable place to stay, from the games in the living room to children's books in the bunk room. Barb left a delicious coffee cake, as well as items to get us started in the kitchen.

We were in town for a family wedding, and we took advantage of the setting for the kids to run around (our 15 mo old son loved the cows), as well as the grill for a family dinner after the wedding (13 people).

Jim was responsive to question while we were on site, and went above and beyond when my husband realized he left his suit pants at home within an hour before the wedding(!!!). Without hesitation, Jim offered to help, and luckily they were close in size!

We highly recommend the Century house!"

The Farm House is exquisite, inside and out. The beautiful woodwork coupled with a modern kitchen, laundry room and bath made this a gorgeous home (it exceeds the nice pictures in the listing). I had family in from the west coast for a wedding and this was the perfect place to congregate as a family and relax. Some of the ""west coasters"" have never seen fireflies and were enchanted by the light show in the fields across from the house. The gazebo became the favorite place to hang out in the evening because of this. The house had everything we needed, just as if we were in our own home. As someone who uses AirBnB often, this was one of the best AirBnB experiences. We will be back when the next child gets married (soon, I hope!)."

Barb made us a delicious coffee cake (still warm) upon our arrival and Jim took the time to teach us about the baby cows on the farm. We loved sitting in the Gazebo at night. Everything was supplied that we needed, tons of towels, fresh sheets if desired, blow up mattresses and even toothpaste for those in our group that forgot it. Beds were very comfortable and everyone slept well. It was close to grocery and amenities but also far enough out that you felt at peace in the country. Watching fields full of fireflies was magical here. Would really recommend this place - a lot of love and care was put into making it a wonderful retreat and the hosts are magnificent."

The house is lovely and relaxing and it was spacious even for our party of six adults. We enjoyed using the large and attractive downstairs rooms—the kitchen, dining room, living room, and front porch. The views from the house are expansive across rolling farmlands and picturesque, such as the red barn in the early morning light. We watched a fox cross the road in front of our group as we sat on the covered porch one evening. We are fortunate to have stayed in this wonderful house and would highly recommend it. The property has very good access to Ashland and Mansfield. And Barb and Jim were perfect hosts."

Cooking Thanksgiving dinner was very easy in this home that included a fully loaded kitchen. It was clean and very spacious. This home was truly an amazing place to stay as it captured the essence of a Century home with its original architecture and charm. I especially enjoyed the morning views from the beautifully screened in porch. I enjoyed looking out into the pasture from the windows that surrounded this beautiful home. It was fun to be able to pet the cows adjacent to the property. Something I'm sure my family will remember for a very long time. The swing that hung inside the porch provided the ambiance of country life in this very exquisite home. To sum up our stay in only one word, it would be peaceful! I would highly recommend this home for your next getaway or romantic excursion."

Stayed a few nights","When we pulled into the driveway at the Century House, we knew it would be difficult to leave. Walking in the back door, we immediately felt at home. My husband loves to cook, and our girls and I enjoy baking. We were pleased to discover the kitchen at this rental house to be well-appointed. Our daughters were excited to find the bookshelves lined with classics, and the cabinets full of games. They couldn’t wait to sleep in the bunk bed room!

Mr. and Mrs. Chandler had written a list of “Things To Do” in and around Ashland during our stay. There was an incredibly delicious homemade coffee cake on the counter, and it was a blessing not to have to worry about breakfast for the first morning of our stay.

The front porch offers a peaceful setting to unwind and watch the sunset. It’s also the perfect place to watch the sun rise over the cornfields and gear up for the day. We could have spent hours watching the calves in the farmyard, a welcome escape from our busy life in a more urban area.

Thank you, Chandlers, for providing us a home away from home. We will return soon!"

The apartment itself is unique with its sports theme, beautifully decorated, and well-stocked to anticipate your every need. Coffee, restaurants and shopping are just outside the building’s front door. On top of all of this, Joe and Brittany were phenomenal hosts - super responsive and welcoming. 5 stars and will absolutely stay here again during our next visit!"

Stayed a few nights","This space is nothing short of AMAZING. It's a little bit of adventure to get up the steps to the doorway but once you open the door, your mouth will drop on how awesome this space feels, how it's decorated, and just feeling like you are truly in a hidden gem in Ashland. My daughter and I came for a college visit and we felt on cloud 9 coming back and forth downtown so close to campus. The downtown area is phenomenal and with the space having a unique rooftop view its one of the coolest experiences. Will make this our go to Air BnB if our daughter goes to school here."

Stayed a few nights","This Airbnb was an amazing experience and the highlighT of our trip! We were not expecting it to be such a large space considering it’s reasonable price but when we arrived we were blown away by how amazing it was! The welcome gifts were so great and the binder left for us to read was full of fun activities in the area, restaurants and even a list of their top recommendations. It also had great details on instructions of how to use all the cool things it came with and how to take good care of the Airbnb so it stayed in good shape once we were done with our stay. Even the response time from the owners was on point and they were so helpful and understanding! We will definitely be coming back to stay in this airbnb"

Stayed with a pet","Talk about a host who has thought of EVERYTHING before you can even think of it yourself. The Cape Cod on Broad was stocked with toiletries, appliances, coffee, creamer, snacks, dog treats, extra blankets, toys for kids, even flossers for your teeth! Being able to have a nice weekend at a cute house that is dog friendly where the host has literally thought of everything you could need (and then some) was a total treat. We didn't know about Ashland, OH before and are very glad to have become acquainted. This was a great base for my husband's ultramarathon race in Mohican State Forest - especially since we could have our pooches with us and have room to spread out. Beds were comfortable, house is super cute, and Ashland was a very nice, pretty, and peaceful surprise."

The place met our expectations set by the listing details and photos and the little thoughtful details through the house were beyond expectation. We were in town for a nearby family reunion and were sad that we didn’t have a lot of time to stay in and relax at the house. The coffee bar area was amazing with offerings of coffee, tea, and hot cocoa. The kitchen and dining area were spacious and welcoming if you want to cook and dine in home. The jetted tub was the cherry on top. We would love to stay here again when we are back in town and hopefully plan some extra down time to spend relaxing. We did not travel with children but I wanted to make sure to add that this place is perfect if you are traveling with a small child. Baby gates, the backyard, a child’s bedroom with adorable decor, child toilet seats installed within adult seats, etc. That was amazing to see."

The lock on the door didn't open the first time but she did warn me so it was fine. The only inconvenience was the only shower is on the first floor and the bedrooms are upstairs. There is a nice bathroom on the second floor with a jacuzzi tub which I am sure is nice for some visitors although we did not use it. There is a swing set in the back which was also nice for us. Abigail did allow us to have an early check in which we appreciated. I would stay there again if I was in Ashland.

The inconvenient little details like a shower only downstairs or the lack of covered parking available were surpassed by the host's willingness to make us feel at home, always very solicitous, quick in responding to messages, and with clear and direct instructions. We will certainly be staying there at a future opportunity."

Stayed about a week","My wife and I stayed a week at the Adeline and felt right at home. The location of the house was close to downtown (~3 min drive) and right up the street from a CVS and a very short drive to a park. The location would be very walkable during the warmer months - we stayed here over Christmas.
What we liked most about the Adeline was that it felt like we were at home. A true home away from home. The house was fully equipped, well stocked, and nicely decorated. The house was very clean and has a mud room - which was very helpful for our winter stay.
The house was also very kid/toddler friendly. There was child proofing (locks on cabinets, toilet training seats, plug covers) throughout the house. We do not have a toddler, so these features weren’t particularly helpful for us, but the child proofing did not cause an inconvenience.
The host was very communicative. She answered questions in a timely manner and gave recommendations for local spots.
Looking forward to staying here again!"

We loved having the pool table. It also felt like you constantly had choices: which shower you preferred, which room to watch TV in, or place to sit outside. You never felt 'stuck' or like you were having to 'settle' for something.
Hosts were extremely helpful and responsive. The space was clean, and had everything you'd need to stay for the entire week. It felt more like a home than a rental for sure. I would highly recommend this space and if we return the area next year it's top of my list to book!
Thanks for a great memorable, retro-week!"

Directly in the backyard is a path to Freer Field, which contains both paved and unpaved walking paths, and a small creek to explore. Our time at the AirBNB was during a time when we were displaced from our home due to a basement with water, so we were already familiar with the area. The home was spotless, and felt like home to us during an otherwise chaotic time in our lives, especially with 5 young children. Aubrey was very responsive to messages, and was flexible with extending check-in/out times as well as extending our stay when the cleaning/restoration project was occurring in our home. We have already recommended Aubrey's place to others, and will be back again should we ever need it (or have out of town visitors needing a space).
Thank you so much, Aubrey!"

We loved the turquoise appliances in the kitchen and the orange leather couch. My 17 year old said he wants to live in a cool place like that when he’s older! The little downtown was only about a mile away with super cute restaurants and shops. And if you like to golf, there is a beautiful course right across the neighborhood.

This location offered us a beautiful home to stay and we enjoyed the fire pit outside in the backyard. There is beautiful walking trails behind the house, the backyard itself is gorgeous and the house is spectacular. It’s a beautiful ranch home very spread out large rooms and spacious. The kitchen is very well appointed and it allowed us to cook in the home. We had fun with family with the pool table could play music and we use the garage so we were able to store our bikes and use the provided bikes to Ride around the neighborhood. The neighborhood is incredibly peaceful with beautiful homes, so it was fun to just walk around and enjoy the area. We will definitely be staying the next time we come to Ashland!

This place was so beautiful! The backyard area was pristine and the family had plenty of room to run around back there. There was also plenty of seating outdoors as well as a fire pit to use. We really enjoyed the playlist for the Rambler. The board games in the house were a big hit as well as the pool table. The kitchen and dinning area were spacious and we enjoyed using the laundry areas as well as the many sitting areas. This is a great place and you won't regret staying here!

Group trip","Hidden gem! This house was perfect for our family stay in Ashland! It truly is a fun house with so many things to do (games, pool table, smart tv, hiking trails in the back yard and outdoor areas to enjoy)! The 60's vibe made offered a neat theme. It is in a quiet, beautiful neighborhood as well! Fun seeing all the Christmas decorations in the house, neighborhood and city of Ashland! Beds were very comfortable! Music room was my favorite room to relax in, but the game room is where my family hung out most of the time. Kitchen & dining area were perfect and clean! So many things provided! We could make meals or sit down with carry out. Loved the coffee station area! Radiant heated floors in several of the rooms was a nice bonus! You won't find a better host than Aubrey! She spoiled us with her quick responses, and true concern for us to enjoy our time at The Rambler. We will definitely be trying to stay here again!"

We brought an extra cooler to put our beer and drinks in. The music room was so nice. Our daughter was playing the grand piano. The decor is very fun and retro. The pool table and texas holdem was fun for all. We used the outdoor firepit the first night. It burns wood very efficiently. Our adult kids had a great time throwing the football and frisbee. The yard is a very big size. I would stay here again and we all truly enjoyed it."

Beds were super comfy (we had them put the twins together in both bedrooms to make king beds for the two couples who stayed.)
And, lots of seating throughout the place made it cozy.
With cold snowy weather, the radiant heat under the floors felt wonderful!
We also enjoyed the views out back into the park. Would have love to walk through there if it were warmer.
Aubrey and cohosts were very accommodating and communication was perfect.
Our family traveled from afar to celebrate our mothers 95th birthday at a local assisted living facility, so this was the perfect spot.
The Rambler is a very special home."

My extended family of cousins booked this home specifically to be able to enjoy its amenities (pool table, games, spaciousness, record player, artful retro decor) as a way to bond together while remembering a beloved family member. That's a big role for a house to fill, and this house filled it perfectly. We had the chance (by chance) to meet Aubrey in person, and she shared that they had created this home specifically to bring groups of people warmly together. It's so much so; everything about our stay was clear, clean, easeful, and reliable, with swift communication and attention. Aubrey, thank you for making a difference for our family at a very special time."

Group trip","I can see why Barb and Jim’s mid-century home has a perfect 5-star rating. This is absolutely one of the best Airbnb’s I’ve stayed in. Not many places turn out to be as clean, lovely, and spacious as the photos — this one did. I booked this a year in advance so my family could see the eclipse. It was the perfect homebase for our dinners, game nights, and restful sleep. We watched the eclipse right from the house! It was my parents’ first Airbnb stay, and I wanted it to be a positive experience for them. They were absolutely blown away by how beautiful the space is and how caring and responsive Barb and Jim are. (One thing for future guests to know is that the roads by the house are not very walkable because of the lack of shoulder, but there are many other places to walk in nature a short drive away, such as Byers Woods.) All in all, if our travels bring us back to this area, we would absolutely stay here again."

Stayed with kids",We spent a magical week during Thanksgiving 2020 at the Mid Century House. It was a welcome respite from the stresses of the year and life. The house is every bit as stunning as the photos and larger and more spacious than what the photos depict. The decor is impeccable and the artwork thought provoking. Barb’s welcome coffee cake is the stuff of legends. The history of the house is also really interesting. We have family in the area and everyone had stories to share about the house. We felt like we were staying in an Ashland historical landmark!

Stayed a few nights","This house is so wonderful! I highly recommend. I stayed with two girlfriends for a little Mom's weekend away, and we had a fabulous time. Barb and Jim have thought of everything. There were flowers and coffee cake waiting for us, which were thoughtful (and delicious) touches. The rooms were incredibly comfortable. We loved that each of us had our own space in 3 rooms, but there is also plenty of room in this house for three couples or even a couple families with kids. I have little ones, and I even thought the laundry room could double as a room for a pack n play if you have a baby with you! Our plan was to hang at the house for a few days, relax, cook our own food, and enjoy some outdoor time. We did all of that, and more. The grocery store down the street was great. The kitchen had everything to make delicious meals. We went on a short hike nearby one day and visited the brewery downtown. Otherwise, we spent the whole time at this fabulous house. It was beautifully decorated and incredibly comfortable. I just cannot say enough good things about our stay. Just a great house and great experience!"

Stayed over a week","Barb & Jim were wonderful hosts. Met us at the property to show us around and answer questions and were quick to respond to all of our needs during our stay.
The house itself is very unique and spacious and has recently been redesigned and beautifully decorated by Barb & Jim. It is impeccably clean and has all cleaning supplies and equipment to keep tidy during your stay. The kitchen is well stocked and Barb was so kind to have made us a coffee cake upon our arrival which was delicious. The beds are extremely comfortable with high quality linens. We had so much fun playing all of our favorite childhood board games with our seven year old daughter.
We could not have chosen a better house in the peaceful countryside of Ohio. Thanks to Barb and Jim to hosting us."

Her home is in a beautiful, safe setting with a lake across the road and a barn and fields the view when you stand at the kitchen sink. Woke up to birds singing and wished that I had had time to go walking in the neighborhood. I arrived later than I had planned, and Diana left lights on for me! When I walked in I was greeted by a very clean, lovely home with treats on the table and basics like sugar, coffee, tea and bottled and filtered water available. There were plenty of clean towels and washcloths in the bath, as well as toiletry items in case you forget something. The bed in the main bedroom was amazingly comfortable (I only slept in that one) with extra blankets available. Diana also had a binder with menus from local restaurants available as well as brochures for local attractions; she really is a great host who thinks of everything you might need! I will definitely stay again when I am in the area."

The home is on owners property but they were very respectful and we’re not intrusive which we appreciated.
The house felt so welcoming and clean we booked another stay just to get away from the hustle and bustle of our everyday life.
Diana provided extras that made our stay delightful such as a couple of bottles of water in the refrigerator and some K-Cups to begin the day.
I would highly recommend this home. Especially if you are like me a value, “clean”."

She turned the lights on to accommodate my late check in, had plenty of amenities to make the stay more than comfortable, responded so quickly to all communication, but didn't bother my while I was there. I'd highly recommend staying at her adorable little place. While I only stayed for a long weekend I'd definitely stay longer if I had a need to be in the area a again. Thank you Diana for being such a great host and letting me stay at your cute home."

He said yes but you will be staying over there. Now that the preliminaries were out of the way, I entered the House that my son and I would be staying at, when we opened the door I was surprised by how well the place looked inside and out it was very cute the beds were comfortable and everything was immaculately very well kept . I would definitely not hesitate from Contacting Diana and booking this AGAIN. Thank You for a WONDERFUL Stay!!!!"

Stayed one night","I would call this kind of a 2 bedroom mother-in-laws suite with it locate close but not connected to the main home.
Great value for the price, clean and roomy with well stocked kitchen with a few snacks and water provided.
Main bedroom matteress was extremely soft, second bedroom mattress was very firm so we had option of which type of mattress we preferred (soft).
Plenty of room, ROKU on very nice digital web based TV. Watched Super Bowl and picture was very clear.
Only drawback is bathroom is small with very small shower. I'm 5 ft 8 inches about 175 lbs and I felt it was a little to tight.
I would and do plan on staying here again.
It is a few miles outside of Ashland with downtown and the college about 4 miles or so away.
Highly recommend Diana's place if you are looking for something near Ashland."

Stayed a few nights","What a great place to stay! Comfortable, clean and uncluttered, with all the little extras that make a guest feel welcome! We loved the outdoor seating area and spent a lot of time there. If you happen to be a bird watcher, please note - I enjoyed seeing and hearing a red headed woodpecker, quite a treat for me. And I was also able to watch an adult ficker feeding its young in the yard across the street.
If you are in the area, don't miss a stay at this wonderful home!"

The kitchen is well supplied. We stayed here a total of 15 days and were easily able to cook all of our meals. The internet was reliable. We didn't watch very much T.V. so we can't comment on that. There are beautiful lakes within walking distance."

Stayed with kids","We lived in Ashland for years, and the location was great in terms of getting into town and anywhere we wanted to go. Our main complaint was a huge stain on the sofa bed when we opened it up. We immediately pushed it back in and my son slept on the bed with my mom and me. There also were a few small stains on the blanket on the bed, so we removed that. There were crumbs in the sink when we arrived, which I cleaned up, and at one point, somebody was jiggling the doorknob into the apartment as if trying to get in - possibly a kid. I've stayed in numerous Airbnb's and cleanliness is my top thing by far, so this was a little disappointing."

As others noted, it is on a busy road, so there is noise from the cars, and the wall between the apartment and the host’s house isn’t super noise proof. Their tv could be heard clearly in the apartment kitchen and I woke up to a screaming child. Still well worth the price vs a hotel room and nothing some ear plugs or white noise on a phone couldn’t fix."

Stayed one night","First off, Monica was super responsive from the get go and allowed me to check in early due to needing a place to get to as soon as possible. She even offered a quick suggestion for a local cafe I could stay at while the place was cleaned.
Even with the early check in, the space was spotless. I felt comfortable and at home right away.
The full kitchen with fridge, stove/oven, coffee machine and utensils was perfect to have on the road. It was too cold for me to go out, but there was a nice patio with a table and a couple of chairs looking out at the backyard.
The space was huge and had everything I needed. I especially appreciated the separate water filtration and the heater in the bathroom.
Check in and out was seamless and the designated parking space close by the entrance was helpful to bring stuff in and out.
There is a bit of street noise but it didn't bother me at all.
I highly recommend. This space is a great value - Thank you, Monica!"

Stayed a few nights","Very nice updated kitchen area. A/C is window unit in bedroom only. My only wish was that we could've opened the doors and windows for a cross breeze- no screen doors to keep the bugs out and no screens in the kitchen windows. The suite was enough space for two of us for two days, bedroom was large. Also a tower speaker to connect via Bluetooth for music- this was nice. Monica was very friendly during a brief phone conversation. Neighborhood was quiet, very nice."

The view of sunrise and sunset was unobstructed. Coming from a fast and bustling country, Singapore, the quiet and peaceful of the loft is healing and refreshing.
The large space to lounge was also a plus for my because I stayed in a lot. The bed, sheets and blanket were all comfortable too.
Thanks for the stay!"

It is a lovely place, spacious, clean, modern and with everything a traveller needs to relax and enjoy the time. Just 4 minutes from Ashland University and just outside of the city, so it provides the quiet of country plus the convenience of city. The king bed was comfy and room was spacious, the kitchen is large with every appliance needed and the check-in process was quick and easy. I am so thankful to know a lovely place to stay as I hope to visit my son in the future. Thank you Monica and J for providing such a welcoming spot for visitors to your beautiful city. Hoping to return many times! ❤️"

There are also nightlights placed in each room in case you get up in the night to get a drink, use the bathroom, etc. The location is just one mile south of the park/softball fields, so that was perfect for me.

Stayed a few nights","Every single thing about the stay at the Westside Suite far exceeded my expectations. Communication, check in, response time, quality, and the amenities were amazing. This was my first stay in an Airbnb that I booked and it really set the bar high for future trips. Monica really has a fantastic place and I hope my boyfriend and I will be able to return and stay there every time we visit his family in Ashland. The bed, pillows, and linens were so comfy and I seriously checked the tags on everything so I could order it all for back home. The kitchen is stocked with everything we needed to prepare our meals and snacks. The bathroom was really nice and the shower head is high enough so I didn’t have to squat like I usually have to at hotels. Even though the suite is connected to the main house I never heard or saw anyone, so it felt very private. It’s perfect for a short or long stay!
Ashland is such a quaint town, I seriously felt like I was in a movie the whole time. Downtown had massive hanging flower baskets everywhere, at the grocery store they still help you out to your car with your groceries, and all the historic houses and beautifully landscaped yards left me in awe. If you plan on visiting Ashland anytime soon here are some of the things I enjoyed that I recommend you do:
- Get the fried chicken and jojo’s from the grocery store Miller's-Hawkins Market. (you will not regret it, I’m sad I didn’t bring a whole suitcase full of that chicken home)
- Ice cream at Yoder's Red Barn Ice Cream. Soooo cheap and delicious!
- Brookside park, the massive trees provide great shade from the sun. The creek and the pond are beautiful, and there’s lots of places to have a picnic. Perfect to take a stroll with your ice cream from the red barn!
- Ashland cemetery. There were so many momma deer with their fawns roaming among the old gravestones. I’ve literally never seen a more beautiful peaceful cemetery in my 31 years on this earth. The trees there are MAGICAL. We sure don’t have anything like them back home in Texas. There’s a huge mausoleum that looks like it’s solids marble inside. So much history in that cemetery, I could of spent HOURS there!
- Antiques on main has some excellent dealers with fantastic taste and really good prices on everything.
- Fig & Oak on Main Street is so dreamy! I purchased all of my gifts for my friends and family back home from this store. I will be ordering from their website to get all the things I wanted but didn’t have room for in my suitcase! The owner (I’m assuming that’s who I met) was so kind and has really created such a beautiful space.
- Grandpa’s cheese barn. Every single thing I ate at this place was to die for!
- Uniontown brewing on Main Street had EXCELLENT food, drinks, service, and prices.
- Wagon Wheel on orange st. Is a cute little bar with clean bathrooms, cheap drinks, good service, and a jukebox with a great selection!
- Bullshooters on E. Main is a bigger dive bar with great people watching, live music, cheap drinks, and live music."
