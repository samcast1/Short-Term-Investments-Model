Stayed with a pet","We were just here for a comfortable place to sleep before continuing a cross-country move with our son and dog, and Denise’s place was a great little reprieve even though McPherson was a little further from our travel route than I realized upon booking (totally my fault for not double checking that part though haha). Denise’s instructions for checking in were clear and helpful upon our very late arrival, and the house was clean, cute, and perfect for what we needed :). There is even a little playground across the street that we didn’t notice until leaving the next morning, but would have definitely taken advantage of with my 6 year old if we’d stayed longer! Overall I definitely recommend Denise’s to anyone driving through or planning to spend time in McPherson, KS— especially if you have pets and/ or kids!"

Stayed with kids","Great stay, and mostly well stocked house. Unfortunately our child got sick, but owner was very responsive and got us some fresh sheets right away. The one thing that would have been nice was more drinkable water. The Brio ran out almost immediately and that was a big problem when trying to get a sick kid rehydrated, we wound up having to go out and buy supplies. However for location, comfort, appearance, and cleanliness this place cannot be beat. The heat was also really comfy."

Stayed a few nights","The house was very nice and clean. It's a super cozy and charming place to stay. All necessities were included as advertised. Comfortable beds as well. Keypad entry was great and easy to use for entering and exiting.
Unfortunately, the fridge went out during our stay and much of our food spoiled overnight, but Denise and her husband handled the situation promptly that same morning and reimbursed us for the spoiled food. They both were very accommodating of the situation. It wasn't an old fridge by any means; it was just an unfortunate situation that could happen to anyone."

It was just as clean and perfectly set up as it was on the first leg of our journey. Very consistent. Just as described in the air bnb listing. Also McPherson is surprisingly really nice. Check out Lakeside park a few blocks from the house. It’s gorgeous.

Denise was a great host! She was very responsive when we asked anything and very accommodating when we asked if we could check in an hour early and check out an hour later due to flight changes.
Her kitchen was fully stocked, extra blankets were provided and if you’d like a tranquil neighborhood walk, this is the place. If I’m ever in the area again, I’ll come back!
Thank you Denise."

Safe location with lots of privacy and only a few blocks to the restaurants. We had no issues or problems through the entire stay. Everything was as described and functioning perfectly. Lee and Sonya are fabulous and even helped get some belongings back to us that were left on accident. This house has easy access to everything in the area and offers plenty of parking off street. It is perfect for quiet relaxation and recharge after a day out and about. I know that I keep going back to how safe and comfortable we were, but I have never been able to relax and have this strong sense of comfort as I did in this location. This is our first choice for the area."

Stayed with kids","The place was wonderful. We all wished we could have had more time there to relax and enjoy it—this trip was demanding regarding our time, but this house is such a great place to relax, and if your family is grieving, to heal before you must get back to the routine. It’s a few miles off the highway, so it’s easy to access, but not so close that you have to deal with the noise or population of traffic. The house and property are pristine, inviting, and very family-friendly. As another commenter posted, there is no TV, but that was one of the selling points for me. We don’t have one at my home either, because it doesn’t suit our lifestyle.
The house is an oasis—a blessed place—and is great if you have business in Wichita, Newton, Hutchinson, or the surrounding area.
Our hosts were proactive and gave me everything I needed to know before I needed to ask. I felt like if we had a need, we would have the support too. There was a hand-written welcome that was a kind touch."

It was way too hot though. The temp setting was at 78 when we got there at 3:30. 12 hours later, it got to a temp that was bearable. The house is old and took longer to cool. Suggest starting at a lower setting to ensure temp lowers for guests. We did not stay the second night. We all sweat to death and just couldn’t. We drove back to Dallas.
I would recommend the place but for summer time, put the setting for guests starting at a comfortable temp."

Stayed one night","My husband and I had a wonderful quick getaway to McPherson! It was our first time visiting, and we already want to go back. McPherson still has a pretty lively Main Street/downtown area. And with the apartment being right there, it was so nice to be able to quickly walk everywhere, and be able to stop back at the Airbnb to drop purchases off or take a quick break before going more places. All within walking distance, we went to two antique stores (The Ark definitely being the better one on Main Street), two gaming stores (that any other fellow nerds would love), and several restaurants that were all wonderful (Neighbors Cafe for breakfast, Main Street Deli for lunch, Easy for a drink, and Ristorante Italiano de Famiglia for dinner). And the apartment itself was super adorable - we loved the antique feel but still with any modern amenities you need (tv, wifi, etc.) My favorite part was getting to spend a lovely morning on the rooftop porch drinking coffee, watching the sunrise, and quizzing each other on ‘90s trivia from one of the provided games the host has in a bin in the living room. I can’t recommend this place enough!
A quick heads-up, though, for anyone visiting in the summertime - there is a/c, but the old building has a hard time keeping up when it’s 100 degrees outside. The host was very nice and quick to respond when we asked to turn the temperature down a bit, but unfortunately the a/c running nonstop could not cool below 76 during the heat of the day. Totally understandable for the age of the building and of no fault to the owner, so this is not intended to be a bad review, but I just want others to be aware of this in case they’re like me and keep their house at 68 and have a hard time sleeping if it’s too warm! So dress appropriately, maybe bring a little personal fan, and we even utilized the ice in the freezer with a wash cloth to help cool us down in the evening - this was a lifesaver for me :)"

We were in the area for state fair so we didn't have the time we needed for sure.

You feel like you have been transported back in time with so many original details still very much a part of the home. The rooms are generously big and you feel like you just belong there. The view of Main Street is an extra treat and you can walk to several shops and restaurants so easily! Our family enjoyed spending Graduation weekend in this beautiful property and would love to come back! We LOVED the library upstairs and the extra care taken to make the entire space feel authentic and welcoming! You won’t find a gem like this easily!

We spent a wonderful three nights at this brilliantly decorated home/loft. There is a surprise and beauty around every corner. The balance of antiques with the officiant updates that give you the functionality of a modern home. I was also truly surprised at how clean and comfortable this place was. I pride myself on being a clean person and understand that keeping older homes clean is much harder than new builds. Whomever cleans this loft does an incredible job!

Group trip","While I loved this very unique space with its mixture of modern and antique/collectible decor, our special trip and celebration was greatly dampened by the fact that the heat was not turned on. In fact, the system was turned to AC when we checked in at 9 pm on an evening that it was 25 deg outside. We could literally see our breath, and the space did not really heat up until around 10 am the next morning due to its size. It was so cold that everyone was wearing gloves, hats, and coats the entire time, most of us even while sleeping. I contacted the host and the only response was “it will heat up soon” and “sorry, but the cleaning lady left it that way”. For the price we paid, it was inexcusable to not have heat and to not offer a discount when an oversight was made. We loved the property but I don’t feel like our comfort was of any real concern to the owner."

My family and I appreciated the snacks and fully stocked fridge. It was such a nice touch to an already beautiful home. Love the neighborhood and location of the house.
McPherson, KS, is familiar to us since we are Central Christian College graduates and former Kansas residents. We visit the state and city at least twice a year. Dana's home made us feel right at home. We greatly appreciate her hospitality and her willingness to go above and beyond for us.
We will definitely book with Dana again! Thank you Dana! Thank you Mac House! ❤️"

Stayed with kids","We enjoyed our stay at the Mac House!
Nestled in a cozy neighborhood, easy-entry, and ALL the amenities you could need. We were in want of nothing. We had the ability to make a meal, relax, and live as if at home for the duration of our stay.

Would recommend this place for a comfy stay."

We have been staying in his Air BnBs since March of 2020, Heathis a great communicator and responds to questions/concerns quickly. This was most likely our last trip to McPherson. This trip was to help move our college grandson home after recently finding out his Dad has cancer. I will miss these trips. I feel like I am leaving part of my extended family."

This is more of an apartment than a house because neighbors live on the floor above you.
The driveway is better suited for cars and smaller SUVs not necessarily trucks, yet they do still fit but with having neighbors you have to be cautious about the location of their vehicles."

Stayed a few nights","Heath was a great host! He made check-in/check-out very easy by sending a detailed message that included everything my friend and I needed to know about his AirBnB before checking in. He was also able to answer all our questions and in a timely manner.
When my friend and I checked in he had a bottle of wine waiting on the kitchen counter which we thought was very accommodating. The space was modern and we loved the style inside and out! Having a garage was awesome and the parking space in the front was convenient. The living space was perfect for the amount of guests allowed. Everything we needed during our stay was available and accessible. There were even make up remover wipes in the bathroom which, we thought was very considerate (that’s a big deal for a woman lol)! We also thought both beds were extremely comfortable and cozy! The Kansas Classic is on a pretty busy street, but not very noisy when you’re inside. I loved how it was so close to Main Street, which has all sorts of stores, restaurants, coffee shops, and the movie theater on it. My friend and I decided to go bowling and Heath’s place is right next to the bowling alley as well. All we had to do was just walk. In my opinion, it’s in the perfect spot in McPherson! If you’re staying in McPherson, Heath’s, The Kansas Classic is the place to stay!"

Stayed with a pet","This home has a beautiful location, take the chance to walk around, bring your frisbee golf discs, there is a beautiful lake for fishing and frisbee golf a very short distance away (tennis courts too!) We enjoyed having the upper part of the home all to ourselves. I would say the only negatives is how firm(hard) the beds are, you can also hear when someone is coming and leaving the basement plus garage door opening and closing which took some getting used to. There were a few active spider webs in the bathroom that I had my husband kill for me :) I do wish the livingroom was a little more comfortable, I laid on the floor, while my hubby took over the couch, but that's not a big deal ,haha The couch didn't fit both of us laying on it too easily! Overall, we really did have a great stay and would stay again if we're come to town again for family. We were able to meet Eric when we got there and he was very kind!"

We had a college graduation reception there with 25 guests. Plenty of space and seating for everyone in dining, living and family rooms. Could not have worked out better.

Stayed with kids","Our stay at Jeff's (Oats and Mo's Place) is the best Airbnb we have ever stayed in. The place was perfect for our multi family stay. We were in need of the many bedrooms and bathrooms and this place was perfect! The beautiful Kansas decor and the personal family touches make the home comfortable and welcoming. The house was extremely clean and I really enjoyed having the separate space of the main floor, the upstairs and the full finished basement. We had a 3 and 5 year old with us. They enjoyed being able to use the streaming services for their ""quiet time"", and climbing the tree in the front yard.
We especially liked the fact that we were offered use of any left over items from the previous visitors in the refrigerator (noting expiration dates and personal choice). I have never seen that before as on offering in an Airbnb. We too ended up leaving food items for the next. Hopefully they won't go to waste.
The family memory given to visitors is a ""sweet"" touch!
We will be back!"

Stayed a few nights","Really not suitable for 6 people. The 3rd bed is a hide-a-bed in the living room. Only 4 chairs for the table, 4 seats in the living room, 4 cups, 4 bowls, etc. There was an extra caned chair in the living room with a hole in the seat we were afraid to sit on. Not very clean - the fridge hadn’t been wiped out, there was a previous guest’s toothbrush in the bathroom, the oven was dirty. There was a sticky film on the hardwood floors. The kitchen pans had burnt crud left on them. There was something sticky on the table that we couldn’t get washed off. A blanket tied to the curtain rod on one bedroom window. I dropped my ring in the bedroom & it went under the bed - when I retrieved it, there was someone’s dirty sock, some trash, & lots of dust bunnies under the bed. Thankfully we were in town visiting family & the 5th & 6th people in our group could sleep at their place, & we decided to cook our meals there instead. No handrail for the stairs & shower was unsafe for elderly parents"

After a week long long trip we were able to comfortably rest watching TV and catch up on the laundry. It had everything we needed and the location was great with a park right in front and all stores nearby.

Stayed with kids",We were traveling through Kansas on our way home to Texas but had to stop and find a place to stay due to a winter storm and icy road conditions. I requested a reservation for the night around 7 pm and despite being so late in the day Kristen responded within minutes. Check-in was a breeze. The home was clean and cozy and the heater worked well despite the cold. We all slept well and we were able to continue on our way the next mornkng without a hitch. Such a lifesaver and so much nicer than a hotel for our family of 6.

The house was fairly clean but could use a thorough cleaning as there was dust and dirt throughout. The shower had hot water but it's an old tub with a shower hooked up. The shower curtain had a mildew smell. The smoke alarm is laying on top of the dirty refrigerator and it does not work. I purchased a battery and put it in but the smoke alarm did not work. The beds were comfortable. The park across the street was nice."

Group trip","My family and I (5 people total) came to stay at this house, and it was pleasant. The furniture and linens all felt and smelled clean, each bed had a set of towels for the bathrooms and overall the necessities were there. I did find a few things that could be improved upon though. Since we were there for a longer stay, there were a lot of people taking showers, and there were no shower matts to lay on the floor so you don't slip. We ended up using some of the extra towels that were in the closet to remedy this, but it would be an easy improvement to the quality of the stay in my opinion. Towel hanging space was thin. The second thing would be that since the house has the ability to sleep up to 6 people, I think it is really important that there be enough seating at the kitchen table for that many individuals. When we stayed, there were only 4 chairs to the kitchen table I think, so the 5th member of our party had to sit on one of our storage boxes to eat dinner. Otherwise, it was great"

Starla and her husband are great, They made sure I was well taken care of during my stay by checking in regularly to make sure everything was running smoothly.
I strongly recommend staying at Cheyenne cabin!"

We found it very cozy and comfortable. We enjoyed the ping pong table and the back patio. The washer and dryer were great! There was plenty of towels/washcloths and such, but the kitchen could use some cooking supplies. Sadly we picked the wrong time of year, it was cold. LOL. All in all we had a great time, and will definitely request your place again ‘if’ we travel to McPherson Kansas again. Thank you very much for sharing your home with us."

We found no trash bags available to replace the one we removed from the kitchen can. We were left less than a half roll of paper towels and not enough toilet paper. We stayed 5 nights so we did have to buy all of these items."

Despite being out in the country and down a gravel road, the place was easy to find, even at night. There was a well mannered and friendly farm dog that greeted us upon arrival and departure.
Great place to stay. We will try to stay here again if available."

The house is so comfortable. The beds are awesome! We enjoyed the peaceful countryside and beautiful sunrises .
The kitchen has everything you need to prepare home-cooked meals.
There are jigsaw puzzles, games and books to enjoy.

The other Wow factor for me was the garage to park in with a door opener, awesome!!
Just a side note there isn't a television available, it didn't matter to us, but if you like having one, you might want to bring a small one with you.
We would definitely stay with Diane again!"

It was the perfect home base to come back to at the end of a long day and relax. Everything was clean and the bed was extremely comfortable, making it hard to get up at 5:30 AM! I was pleasantly surprised by the veritable buffet of breakfast and other snack options, with oatmeal, cereal packs, cracker jack caramel popcorn, Keurig coffee varieties, and more I'm probably forgetting - meant to take a picture but forgot. The power went out for about 2-3 hours on our second day, I'm guessing due to weather conditions, but it was back sooner than I expected, and faster than when that happens at my own rural house! We loved the peace and quiet and would like to come back next year if possible."

We never thought this would be something we’d be so excited about, but the homemade sausage egg breakfast burritos just out-shined it all!
Such a sweet gesture to add to the exclamation point that is the gorgeous quarters, so roomy, clean and never once felt uncomfortable or imposing. (This was our first time staying in someone’s home, we’ve always rented uninhabited rentals).
Again, absolutely wonderful and if we’re ever this way again we will surely make a point to stay again!! Thank you!"

My favorite was the comfort and cleanliness- the bedding smelled home-laundered clean, unlike the hotel we’d stayed at the night before. I might have gone a little crazy in the concession stand of snacks they had available. Dallas and Patricia make you feel welcome, like they enjoy opening their home to give you comfort by all the little extras they have provided. We left refreshed."

Clean, beautifully appointed, quiet and spacious. Everything you'd want in lodging and more. You get twice the square footage of a typical hotel room for less than half the price when you're traveling with two big dogs. If you're heading east or west on I-70 and can make a stop in central Kansas, it's worth a 30-minute detour on I-135 south to McPherson to stay here for the night."

The bed was extremely comfortable, and the family room had comfy couches and chairs for a crowd. It is a great place to stay."

We were very thankful to find this place!"

The only thing that was a problem was the back bedrooms were very, very cold. There is no heating in them so we were struggling a little. Overall a very nice place!"

It was so warm, cheery and cozy coming in to a pretty Christmas tree and the fireplace on. You can tell the hosts put a lot of love and thoughtfulness into everything. Great location right off the highway."

We loved the location. Every amenity you would ever need is provided. The assortment of breakfast items and hot drinks are varied and amazing. Dallas is excellent to work with. If we are in the area again, we’d definitely stay at Dallas’ AirBnB."

My only complaint is the TV and entertainment center. The TV has a red line running through the center and a large green stripe across the top. The cable box and DVD player didn't work either. They do have Netflix and Prime video.
Overall, this is a beautiful space to get away and enjoy the quiet of the country while being close enough to the city and highway."

Stayed a few nights","WOW! This is definitely a hidden diamond! The extremely thorough thoughtfulness of extra touches (bottled water, snacks, toiletries, etc) and absolutely gorgeous accomodations definitely make this place feel like home away from home. The pictures don't do it justice either... simply amazing! If my fiance's daughter ends up attending college at CCC, we'd love to make this place our regular spot while visiting! She even said she'd come stay with us there if we're visiting because she loved it too. That should say a lot coming from a teenager! Lol! Thank you so much for everything, y'all! Most definitely recommend!"

Stayed with kids","This was by far our favorite Airbnb stay. Patricia and Dallas were very warm and welcoming. Checkin was easy and the space was very clean. It had a homey feel while still offering a large space to have our family over while we visited. Patricia set up the kitchen with goodies, a keurig stocked with a large variety of pods, and all sorts of snacks and treats. She made some frozen burritos for a quick tasty breakfast, complete with sides of salsa. She also purchased a waffle maker specifically for our families stay, and included everything we’d need to make a waffle breakfast. She provided additional items throughout our stay. This stay felt less like a temporary rental, and more like coming home. It was so comfortable and welcoming that I actually felt a little homesick to leave. We can’t wait to stay here again on our next visit!
Also, the pictures really don’t do this space justice. This is a very large space and decorated with a modern country feel."
