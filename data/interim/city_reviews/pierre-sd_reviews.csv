Stayed a few nights","Rachel was amazing, she gave clear and concise directions to the location prior to the trip. Check in was very easy and she was waiting for us when we arrived. The location was large and contained every accommodation we needed and was also very clean. Rachel is very good at communicating on her end as well as responding to any questions or needs regarding the stay in a timely manner. As great as the location was, Rachel is what made the stay go from great to amazing, she’s also a great cook. I would highly recommend ‘The Lodge at Medicine Creek Farms’."

Stayed one night","We couldn't believe our eyes!
The lodge is on such a beautiful land right on the Missouri River.
The location: Very easy to find. It is only a ~ 15 minutes from Pierre and really easy to get to.
The space: Wonderful spacious rooms. Super clean and had all the amenities. The peace and waking up to the sounds of nature was unique.
The breakfast: Finger licking good! The scrambled eggs were from fresh farm chickens, and they were Delicious!
The host: Rachel is an amazing person. They have done so much on the farm, and she runs the lodge perfectly. We really enjoyed our conversations with her and learned so much.
Thanks so much, Rachel, for your hospitality."

The place is located on the river. They have all kind of animals you’d find in a farm and you’re allowed to stroll anywhere. Rachel has been a kind hostess to us. She also cooked a warm breakfast for us. Wished we stayed there longer. Highly recommended for a quiet getaway from city noises."

The room itself was huge, actually had a sectional couch in it, our own tv, comfortable bed, and everything was spotless. Rachel was the best host, provided a home cooked breakfast that was delicious, coffee every morning, fresh baked cookies and other snacks really more than we could have asked for. Rachel was also very helpful with directions and just the sweetest person. We were only there for a short stay, but I would recommend 100%! We really loved this place and wish we could have stayed longer."

Stayed one night","This was the best airbnb experience my husband and I have ever had! Rachel was super professional, kind, and an excellent communicator and host. The lodge was stunning, luxurious, and comfortable. We were traveling across the country for a move and it was a super convenient location for us. My husband and I had the privilege of having the whole lodge to ourselves the night we stayed—which was an added unforeseen bonus—but I think we would have loved it nearly as much and possibly more if there were other guests we could have shared the common spaces with. (We were looking forward to meeting other people!) Finally, the breakfast Rachel prepared for us was spectacular. Truly, our expectations were exceeded at every turn. We would recommend this airbnb to everyone!"

In the common area, we could use the pool table, massage chair, and foosball table. Breakfast included home-grown bacon, which was absolutely out of this world. Internet was fast and reliable.

Stayed one night","A truly memorable AirB&B experience. This is the real deal--a working farm/ranch that doubles as a spacious, comfy guest house, at a spectacular location right on the Missouri River. It's only about 15 minutes east of Pierre but feels like a world apart. My room was one of the suites with a private door to a patio overlooking the river. It was sizzling hot outside, but the room's A/C did the trick. Tons of stars at night! Rachel was super-communicative and cooked a wonderful eggs-and-pancake breakfast. The crowning touch was the otherworldly experience of the massage chair in the commons area...how a mechanical device can simulate a real massage so skillfully, I'll never know."

Stayed one night","This lodge is located a few miles outside of Pierre on a bluff overlooking the Missouri River with spectacular views. It is one of the most comfortable places we have ever stayed with Airbnb. The common areas of the lodge provide open spaces where guests can sit and chat, watch TV or just hangout. The bedrooms provide private areas with plenty of space and spotless bathrooms. The outdoor areas are accessible and we were able to interact with the owners chickens and goose, hear coyotes howling in the distance and see mule deer in the front yard.
Breakfast is included and features true farm to table ingredients prepared by Rachel and made fresh each morning. This is a very special place."

Stayed one night","You MUST book this Airbnb if you are ever in the Pierre, SD area! My two siblings and I stayed for one night at Rachel’s place during our road trip across the US. We were pleasantly surprised with the place and had more than enough space to rest - we each had our own separate rooms within a suite.
Rachel is such a great host! We arrived later than expected (forgot to consider the change in time zones), and Rachel didn’t get mad about it at all. Rachel even cooked the three of us breakfast with pancakes and fresh eggs from their family’s free range chickens.
I can’t even describe in words about how amazing our stay was! This was definitely our favorite Airbnb spot during our trip. I’d recommend checking in before the sun goes down since the place might be harder to find at night. Dinner and lunch spots are also a 15+ drive into town. Last tip: use the massage chair! Amazing!"

Why stay in a tiny hotel somewhere where you could have a lovely space on the river just a bit out of town?! We were able to get a cab ride into town for a night out with drinks. Such gorgeous views from
This place. Plenty of space and privacy. If you had a large group, for either reunion, fishing or hunting, it’s amazing! I would book it if we lived in a neighboring state. Perfection for relaxation"

Stayed one night","The lodge was easy to find; you can spot the tower from a distance. The location was a very quiet, scenic stretch of the Missouri River. You can hear every bird singing and cow mooing from miles away. Stargazing late at night was amazing. Host Rachel was there to greet us when we arrived, giving us information about the facilities and nearby dining. The room was very nice, put together for easy cleaning to accomodate hunters. Every room has its own bathroom. They are building a large addition, scheduled to finish in the fall of 2016. Breakfast was pancakes and eggs from their own henhouse. Take it easy traveling down the driveway, as the chickens are a little slow to get out of your way. Also fresh fruit, yogurt, juice, coffee, etc. This was a very unique and interesting place to stay on our way to the Black Hills. We really enjoyed our stay."

Stayed a few nights","What a fabulous place. The Lodge was a perfect place for some r&r for the two nights we were there. There were no other guests staying at the time, so we had the whole guest area to ourselves, which consisted of an enormous living area with comfy seating, a massage chair and a huge TV, much to my husbands delight which meant he could watch football (soccer) on Sunday morning before we headed out for a walk along and then a dip in the Missouri River, perfection.
We had their largest suite which was wonderful, very comfortable with a large corner sofa, but best of all, were the river views to wake up to.
Rachel and and Joe were wonderful hosts, very welcoming and interesting to talk to and we were astounded at how hard they work and with such ease and grace.
A 5 star breakfast was served each morning, which was an unexpected delight, and among other choices, there were eggs freshly laid by their free range chickens.
Cattleman's club steakhouse, half a mile up the road from the Lodge is a must for any visitor, incredible. I would highly recommend staying here. Rachel and Joe, thank you so much."

She sent us detailed instruction on how to find the farm to check in and wait for us even though we arrived quite late. Rachel even made a great breakfast for us the next morning. The farm locates right next to Missouri river and it is very beautiful. The lodge is spacious, clean, and super comfortable. You can find anything you need. My friend and I are really surprised and amazing by staying with Rachel. I would highly recommend Rachel and her farm to anyone traveling around Pierre."

The Lodge at Medicine Creek, which sits on the shores of the Missouri River, belongs to a darling couple, Rachel and Joe, who could not have been more hospitable, welcoming and accommodating. Our bedroom was beautiful, clean and so comfortable with a priceless view of the river. Breakfast was delicious. An unexpected perk was the use of their massage chair which, after long hours of driving, felt wonderful and relaxing. We have spent two nights here and will be back whenever travelling through the area. Highly, highly recommend!!"

Cell phone reception is patchy on and off the highways so communicating with Rachel was difficult en route. Rachel stayed up until midnight to let us in and showed us our room. She was welcoming and understanding despite the lateness and showed us our room. The rooms are large and airy and are on the banks of a beautiful river. The landscape is stunning. Rachel made us a wonderful breakfast which sustained us for the next chapter of our journey. It was wonderful to meet Rachel and get a small insight into life on the ranch...we wish we could have stayed longer.

Stayed one night","The listing description was totally accurate and it didn't even express how beautiful and peaceful it is there. I didn't realize it was 56 miles off the interstate (my fault) but it was worth the drive!! They greeted us so nicely and made us feel right at home and part of their family. Which they have a lovely one. Our room (suite really) was so nice and private. It was like we were in our own home. Rachel made breakfast and it was so good and we appreciated the time she took to send us on our way with a good breakfast. It is a beautiful lodge on a gorgeous setting. We got to watch the sun set, really pretty. Loved this place and hope we can come back some day."

Extras include the ability to use the fridge and freezer - a boon to us with our cross-country supplies in our cooler. Dinner recommendation for the Cattleman's Ranch down the road made for a perfect evening. And a full farm breakfast the next day was an unexpected pleasure. Thanks, Rachel!"

I am amazed at how wonderfully spacious and luxurious everything was for such a low price. And it's right on the river! We only stayed for a brief night but commented to each other about how wonderful it would be to take a long, relaxing vacation here. What a special place.

As far as Rachel, I don't think we could have met a sweeter person. We arrived after midnight but she stayed up just for us and gave us a tour and answered all of our questions. She made us a delicious breakfast at the time of our choosing in the morning and also allowed us to use the kitchen even though that was not a listed amenity. We ended up staying for a few hours after checkout because of our long night and were not interrupted or asked to leave at any point. Rachel and the Lodge have my highest possible recommendation."

Stayed a few nights","We wanted our ""citified"" kids to get a little taste of country life, and they sure got it at Medicine Creek Farms. When we arrived, the alfalfa had just been cut and it smelled SO good! My daughter and I took some lovely walks down the bank, to the river. All 3 of our kids were fascinated by the chickens and the idea of eating fresh eggs.
Sitting in the middle of all that beautiful country is a really cozy lodge. Our private suite was just the right size for us to share family time and still have some elbow-room.
The breakfasts were absolutely delicious. Our favorite was the ""French Toast Bake"", but the ""Apple Pancakes"" were a very close 2nd.
The gorgeous sunsets over the Mighty Mo were the frosting on the cake. The pictures we took were hang-'em-on your-wall gorgeous!
We look forward to staying at the Lodge again next time we're in the area."

Stayed one night","I had a conference in Pierre and decided this place would be *way* more interesting than a cookie-cutter hotel. It was completely worth it. It's about 15 miles from town, so it took about 20 minutes for me to travel back and forth from the convention site, but it was a beautiful drive along the Missouri. The lodge itself is situated right on the river, with fantastic views. I happened to be the only guest that night, so I practically had the run of the place. The corner suite was huge, with large windows, a patio looking over the river, a massive sectional sofa and a very comfortable queen-size bed. It was also incredibly quiet: the hosts have five children (with number six on the way!), and although my suite was adjacent to their living area, I didn't hear a thing the entire time I was there.

The hosts serve breakfast for guests, but I only had time to avail myself of the coffee before I had to get out the door in the morning. If I'd needed dinner, the lodge is only a few miles down the road from the Cattlemen's Club, a long-established steakhouse along the river.

The hosts were incredibly friendly. I arrived mid-evening, and they were more than happy to let me plug in my Chevy Volt overnight so I could get a full battery charge. They even indulged me on a tour of the place. Their expansion will be amazing when it's done, with a beautiful great room, large fireplace and viewing tower overlooking the river and the prairie. They've even got a hot spring on-size that they'll use to heat the place. I wish I would have been able to stay longer to get to know their family better.

It's obviously geared toward pheasant hunters, but the lodge is a super great choice for anyone traveling to central South Dakota. Because of the way the suites are laid out, it would be especially great for families or large groups traveling together: each suite is sort of a self-contained unit of three bedrooms and two bathrooms, so even groups of six or eight would have room to spread out.

Overall: great experience, friendly people. beautiful location. I'll definitely look for availability the next time I'm in Pierre for business."

The lodge itself was idyllic--very spacious, clean, and comfortably furnished. Moreover, the river-facing windows throughout the place offered amazing views of the Missouri and surrounding landscape.
We especially loved our private room with its own bathroom and walk-out patio. More pluses: two kitchen areas with fridges and freezers; super comfortable bed; adorable kittens playing on the farm; and a delightful porch swing.

Stayed one night","Exquisite historic home with generous owners. They were very welcome to me (as a solo, male traveller) and I felt so privileged to stay here compared to a hotel, and to learn about the home and its original owners.
The set-up is great, and one will have access to a water dispenser and mugs, tea/coffee in the next room- this was very convenient. The en-suite bedroom was first-rate, with wifi access and streaming networks. I would genuinely have paid much more to stay here, but it really was meeting the current owners- Ashley and Kevin, in addition to Sherry, that made it a fantastic stay. They are nearby if you need anything, but at the same time leave you to make use of their house (within reason!) It actually wouldn’t have been the same if they were away."

There were some lovely additions from when we stayed last summer: extra pillows, a hot and cold water cooler in the breakfast nook, and the attached deck to the breakfast nook has been renovated.
My husband enjoyed sitting downstairs in the study to have his coffee.

It was so nice outside that we had our coffee under the pear tree in the morning and enjoyed sitting on the porch in the afternoon. The weather was perfect for porch-sitting! We had a delicious dinner at Mad Mary's and a wonderful Mexican lunch at Gallos. We had Scooter's coffee but heard the Branding Iron Bistro was a great breakfast spot. We had a wonderful time and would definitely stay again when we are in the area.

Check-in was secure and easy, using a key pad. The individual room where we stayed had its own key to lock the room, which was a plus. The bathroom is attached to the room, which also gave it added privacy. Also, there is a small walk in closet to put your luggage and hang up your clothes. I really liked that!
This house is also tucked away from traffic, but still only a few blocks from the downtown center. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and look forward to staying there the next time I’m in Pierre!"

The view is so nice from the deck and Patrick has thought of everything for your needs to be comfortable. Rocking chairs, blankets, tabletop fireplace and a really cool backyard to enjoy. Toys galore for the kids.. The view from the deck is for stargazing and the sounds of wildlife make you feel you are in the wilderness.The bedroom off the deck has a slider that allows you to open and let in the fresh air and the sounds of nature. Beds were dressed in beautiful linens, and were very comfortable. The house is filled with all the amenities that anyone would need. The refrigerator had condiments, and all the little things you would not remember to bring. Patrick's home is a top notch place to stay. We highly recommend this house for a wonderful experience. Patrick is a wonderful communicator and we did not have to wait anytime for his response to our questions. All in all, a GREAT experience."

Stayed with kids","Patrick's home is as described. It's warm and welcoming - the decorations around the home are fun and just like ""home."" I did some baking and cooking while we were there and found everything I needed to complete the kitchen tasks. The kitchen was fully stocked with spices and there were even some condiments in the refrigerator. The floors and carpets and furniture and appliances were clean and user-ready. Amenities were close by. I had questions during our stay and Patrick was easily accessible and answered quickly. There was a fenced-in backyard, hammocks, toys for the kids to play, a swing set, trampoline, and plenty of room on his glorious deck. I cannot recommend this home enough."

Group trip","Hope’s Anchor Airbnb is absolutely pristine! We would definitely book again in the future! The hosts were absolutely lovely & personable & I loved learning unique little things about the property that Darcy and Andrew shared with me.
It was a bummer that the weather was SO foggy for the 3 days we were there, as I know the scenery out there is beautiful & it would have been nice to see the views, but that is just one of those uncontrollable things. Do beware that if it is rainy/wet/snowy, the muddy roads are not good. We saw 2 vehicles stuck. Again, doesn’t take away from the property at all. This place is 5 stars all day long!!!"

Group trip","We loved the house and really enjoyed our stay. It was warm and cozy on our cold January stay. All the amenities listed were present and the beds were comfy with plenty of extra bedding if it was needed. We needed a place for 8 to stay for a 2-day event in Pierre and it was a bit outside of town. The drive was easy and it really wasn't too far, especially for the cost (way cheaper than it would have been for a hotel for all of us and way more fun since we all got to be together). We will definitely keep it in mind for future trips to Pierre."

Stayed over a week","WOOOOOWWW
One of the best Airbnb’s we’ve stayed (and we’ve been staying at them over past 3 mo or so). Why you ask?
* Excellent communication with Katie, she was very responsive and friendly
* Quality appliances, dishes, knives etc
* Comfy foam queen bed, (I think the full bed in the front room is a pillow-top)
* strong water pressure in shower (although the standup shower was a bit small, but not at all a deterrent for us)
* loved having front door open with the glass door, let so much light in!
* extra space in the closets was nice to have as we were traveling with quite a bit of bags
* super close to the river and town
* if it’s summer, make sure you go to a Pierre Trappers baseball game! This stadium and hospitality is TOP NOTCH!
If your travels take you to Pierre, and Katie’s place is available, you’ll wanna book and stay here!"

Group trip","This is one of the finest AirBNBs we have stayed in. Our group did not stop talking about how comfortable and well maintained the home was. The home was cozy and comfortable and had ample space and beds for all adults to have a large bed of their own for a recharging rest, especially after our back to back hunting days. The beds are all comfortable and exceeded our expectations. These owners really took care to provide quality sleeping for their guests, which can be hit or miss with most Airbnbs. Some hunting party members were even able to do a little early morning telework when they needed in the private downstairs den as us folks who know how to unplug and have a proper vacation enjoyed our socializing upstairs in the main den! Ample space for a few trucks to park up at the garage, great mud room and laundry facilities, and a kitchen just like at home if eating in. This is hands down THE place to stay!"

Stayed a few nights","We had a fabulous time staying in this house. We've been on the road in the USA for the last four years, so we've seen many different rental houses, and this was one of the best. The owner and team are extremely responsive and thoughtful. Everything is very clean and very well planned. Nice quality towels, sheets, pillows, etc. - that really makes a difference. Comfortable furniture.
We would not hesitate to stay here again. We enjoyed being in the country - hearing and seeing meadowlarks, pheasant, sparrows, flycatchers, etc., while being only about 5 minutes from the center of town. Peaceful and private location!"

When we informed her that the cleaning team had not left toilet paper, she quickly brought it over herself. Four instead of five stars because the bathrooms and kitchen were a bit dated and tired, with a lack of attention to cleaning details."

All cooking utensils in great condition that you would need for a long stay. My stay was right around Christmas and it was a pleasant and unexpected surprise to find a fully decorated Christmas tree in the house. A very thoughtful touch that made my stay extra homely. Stan even came and checked in during the stay to make sure everything was well. 100% would highly recommend the host and place. Would definitely stay here when I revisit!
Stan - thank you for being such a hospitable host!"

Stayed with kids",We had a great stay. The main living room is very large and was perfect for my toddler to play in. My only suggestion is to bring some earplugs if you are a light sleeper since there is a road and train tracks nearby. But that also makes the location very convenient.

Most importantly, Stan our host, was very attentive and responded quickly. His goal was to keep us happy. I recommend this property and this host to anyone."

It was also very clean and comfortable and the neighborhood is quiet, which allowed us to get good sleep on our road trip. There is even a big nearby park where we were able to walk our dog. Would jump at the chance to stay here if we're in Pierre again."
