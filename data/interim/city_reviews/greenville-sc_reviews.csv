Kaye thank you so much for sharing your treasure. We definitely will be returning. Downtown Greenville is minutes away Uber was $11 give or take. Check out the treehouse you'll fall in love ❤️"

Stayed a few nights","This was BY FAR the greatest rental I have ever stayed at. The location was no more than 10-15 minutes to anywhere we went in downtown Greenville, yet while you were at the location, it felt like you were so secluded. The house was spotless and I am very picky when it comes to cleanliness! I didn’t think it would be possible for the house to be even more beautiful than the pictures, but it was! Kaye was so kind to leave easy directions, fresh flowers, coffee and treats. I am trying to find the next time I can visit again for the peacefulness and convenience of this home!"

Stayed a few nights","Fantastic home. Very well built, decorated, and maintained. Exactly like the photos. We loved the multiple outdoor spaces and quiet of being amid the trees. Our kids loved the rope hammock, and it was very comfortable. Host communicated very well and left a few items at check in that were greatly appreciated. House rules are to remove shoes, which we gladly did. The property is very clean and well maintained."

Stayed a few nights","I can’t say enough positive things about the experience. From the moment you walk inside, you feel comfortable, peaceful, and like you’ve escaped. Comfortable linens, so well decorated, and everything you need. All the extra touches and beautiful interior design make it special. Fresh flowers and cookies were an added touch. The porches, heater, outdoor tv, and roof top deck were amazing. I will definitely come back and have already recommended to friends. Thank you"

Stayed a few nights","We loved our stay in the Cozy Treehouse! That’s exactly what it is - cozy. Loved the decor, so well thought out and top quality. So peaceful nestled among the trees and greenery. Ate lunch on the deck with the sun shining through the trees. Near perfect! Coffee, creamer, and snacks were plentiful and appreciated. Shower was phenomenal. Everything really was just perfect!"

Stayed a few nights","I’ve stayed in plenty of Airbnbs and NEVER have I been this impressed. The attention to detail in the building process, decor, amenities, cleanliness, location. Everything about this stay was perfect. Kaye was very responsive and welcoming with awesome recommendations. It was very close to downtown while also feeling like an escape from everything. The peaceful view and the comfy and cozy spots to lounge around made it the perfect spot. I was nervous because the photos looked perfect and I’ve never stayed anywhere that the pictures matched the actual place perfectly. When I walked in I was in disbelief by how accurately it was all described. I will never stay anywhere else when I visit Greenville. Thank you so much kaye for creating such a dream for people. You should be proud! 🥰"

Stayed a few nights","I’ve been staying in AirBNB’s around the US and Europe for over 10 years and this was the most beautiful and cleanest one I’ve stayed in. It was in absolutely pristine condition when we arrived and our host, Kaye, left detailed instructions on how to operate everything in the home as well as snacks, coffee, tea and fresh flowers. All of the attention to detail throughout the home really made it feel like a home away from home verses the usual stale hotel feel. The home is very close to downtown Greenville which was beautiful as well and filled with many things to do and restaurants. I would highly recommend staying here!"

Stayed a few nights","It isn't often that places hit so spot on to expectations, but our stay at the cozy treehouse was as good as we expected, and more. The attention to detail that Kaye has put into her rental did not go unnoticed. Not only was this a great place for us to spend our time in Greenville, but it has the kind of lasting impression where I am thinking about what kind of projects I want to bring back to our home. The only negative I can think of is the train that comes nearby at night; be prepared to set up some white noise to help you sleep through the horn as it comes through. Even with that, I see ourselves returning to the treehouse next time we are looking to visit Greenville."

The house is peaceful, well organized, and cozy. The cargo net hangout was a big hit after a day of skiing. The modern Scandinavian vibe made it perfect for a winter weekend away. My family loved the stay and will recommend this listing to all of our friends and family. Kaye was a perfect host. We cannot wait to come back and visit again!"

Stayed a few nights","A wonderful stay on a very unique property. This is indeed a very ""cozy"" location, but also quite spacious for what it is. It's built higher off the ground, which lends to the treehouse feel (although it's not the same type of ""treehouse"" you may have had as a kid!).
Very clean, comfortable, and quiet. Tons of natural light through large windows, which we loved. There is lots of outdoor seating, with several porch areas. This place was exactly what we were hoping for, and we were very pleased. Just be sure to read the description and instructions carefully. We were fine without a full kitchen, and came prepared accordingly.
We recommend this place highly. It was a peaceful, private stay in a uniquely imagined space. Host was excellent and very responsive to our needs. Thank you!"

Stayed a few nights","I would stay here again and highly recommend for anyone looking for a clean, beautiful accommodation. It felt like home. You don’t even need slippers, it’s that clean.
Everything was perfect, from the decorations to the furniture, the comfortable bed and the fully stocked kitchen, just bring your food and drink to stay awhile. No corners were cut while building this tree house.
Kaye was also very helpful with any questions or issues we had. We had a hard time unlocking the door but soon figured out we were hitting more than one number with our fat fingers.
This property is well worth the money for privacy and tranquility. I plan to visit when it’s a bit warmer to try the outdoor shower and hang out on the roof top nest. Thank you, Kaye for a wonderful first time visit to Greenville. We will be back."

Stayed a few nights","Kaye’s cozy cabin exceeded all of my expectations ! I can’t say enough about how much I enjoyed the stay here. It was squeaky clean, all the pictures posted were accurate (maybe even looked better in person). The cabin is around 15 minutes from downtown but felt so private with all the space in the back. Some of my favorite features were the floating hammock and outdoor shower. Kaye went above and beyond to leave specific instructions for getting there and any questions I may have about the place itself. Also left a few treats before I arrived <3 Wish I could give this place 10 stars. Anyone planning a visit to Greenville definitely needs to book this place it’s so worth it !"

Stayed with kids","Absolutely loved this home. It was exactly how the pictures showed it to be, very clean & welcoming for our arrival. The host was easy to communicate with throughout our booking. We were looking for a unique stay in a treehouse & this checked all those boxes. Had the feeling of being in the wilderness but close to everything Greenville has to offer. The decor & style of the home was lovely & the little unique touches that made it stand out from other locations (outdoor shower, rooftop balcony, net hammock area). It was great to wake up and be among the trees in the morning & there was plenty of privacy. We would highly recommend this to friends & would definity go back to stay there again."

Kaye was a wonderful host and communicator throughout our stay. Was given clear checkin and checkout instructions. Enjoyed our welcome basket of snacks, water and sweets upon arrival. The treehouse was unique and tranquil with so many added features. Loved our time on the inside hammock between floors, the screened porch with comfy furnishings, and amazing indoor/outdoor shower. We even ventured up the stairs to the top deck for views which should not be missed. Definitely recommend Kaye’s place for your next trip to the Greenville area. It will not disappoint."

Stayed a few nights","The Cozy Tree House was even more spectacular than we anticipated! I could live there !
We got a lot of use out of the screened in back porch. The outdoor heater made the porch even more cozy as the nights that we used it ,the air was quite chilly.
We also loved the huge walk in shower in the master bedroom and the adjacent outdoor shower.
The welcome basket and fresh flowers were a nice surprise !
We were there for a girls trip for the "" Fall for Greenville "" festival.
We also checked out Unity park , some breweries , wineries and great restaurants.
I hope to return for another girls trip in the spring."

I will be honest and say we were a little concerned when we were approaching the driveway, but as we turned in we were pleasantly surprised with how private the location was. This home is absolutely adorable inside and out. The side screened in porch was one of our favorite parts. We loved the house so much that we decided to get take out and stay in the second night so we could enjoy the space. There really isn't one detail that was missed! Kaye left us snacks and worked with us on check in time. The decor is so cute and we had everything we needed for a fun weekend stay in Greenville. We will definitely be back."

A-Frame houses so this was a special treat. My only wish is that I would have waited until the weather was a little warmer to book so I could have enjoyed the outdoor spaces more. I will def stay again if I’m Greenville!"

Stayed a few nights","We absolutely LOVED our stay at the Cozy Treehouse. We booked our honeymoon stay in Greenville based on this Airbnb alone, and it was the perfect place to wind down and enjoy each other’s company in a peaceful environment surrounded by trees and nature.
The house itself was by far the most clean, homey, and well decorated Airbnb we’ve stayed at. We enjoyed the incredible showers, large windows, outdoor decks, and the cozy screened in porch– it was the perfect spot for lounging or having a movie night! Although the treehouse is tucked away and feels very private, it’s still super close to downtown which is very convenient. The only minor inconvenience to staying here is not having an oven or stove, but we planned out meals ahead of time and also went out to eat.
During our stay, Kaye was super accommodating and responded quickly to any questions we had. Overall, we would HIGHLY recommend staying at the Cozy Treehouse for a unique and serene getaway! All of our friends and family members are dying to visit after seeing our photos, and we hope to come back again in the future!"

Stayed with kids","We loved our stay at The Cozy Treehouse! This is a very unique property with stunning decor and really cool touches like the cargo net hammock that hangs over the living room from upstairs and the outdoor shower. The huge windows and multiple porches made us feel like we were sleeping in the treetops surrounded by green leaves, but it’s really convenient to downtown (a quick 10 min drive). The screened in porch was also a favorite hang out spot. Just make sure you plan ahead with meals since there is no oven or stove or plan to eat out. They have an outdoor fire pit (which we could have used for hot dogs and s’mores) but it was pouring the first night and too hot the next. This would be super fun in the fall with all the leaves changing! We highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","This treehouse was a dream. From the treats on the counter when we arrived, to the ceiling fans on the screened in porch, to the extra toiletries provided, Kaye and Ben thought of every little detail to make our stay comfortable, enjoyable and unique. The treehouse itself had some of neatest features, but the hammock on the second floor had to be our favorite. The decor, ambiance and natural lighting made you feel like you were lost in the mountains, but in reality you're just 10 minutes from everything in Downtown Greenville. We didn't spend much time on the top balcony, at the fire pit, or on the back porch, simply because we went in May amongst an abundance of mosquitos and spiders. There was some work being done on the property (tree cutting), but Kaye and Ben were extremely communicative and apologetic that it coincided with our stay. Overall, highly recommend the Cozy Treehouse for a one-of-a-kind trip!"

We loved lounging on the screened-in porch as well as on the indoor hammock suspended from the second floor!! (I think our next home will have one!) Everything was finished with incredible craftsmanship and quality. Such a peaceful environment. It was a perfect, quiet setting for our family of four! Even our teenage boys enjoyed the space and slept well in the bunkbeds.
Our hosts, Kaye and Ben, were so accomodating. We celebrated a milestone birthday and Kaye was willing to pick up pre-ordered balloons and special treats from 2 Chefs as a special surprise for the birthday girl. And, they were super quick to respond to any questions we had during our stay. No wonder this space is AMAZING. It was built by AMAZING humans.
Thank you! We will return during our next visit to Greenville!"

Stayed a few nights","We had a wonderful weekend at the cozy treehouse. The build quality, design, and amenities of the treehouse were top-notch, and it was perfectly suited for a couple’s getaway. The proximity to downtown Greenville was great—we were still able to eat at our favorite places in the city, and retreat to our treehouse in the woods within minutes.
Do be aware that while the outside surroundings are beautiful and serene, there are neighbors close by, so you will be able to hear the occasional sounds of people, kids, dogs, and lawnmowers. You can also hear the train and sounds of traffic with the city being so close. However, if you’re inside with all the windows/doors closed it’s very quiet.
This is by far our favorite AirBnb we’ve stayed in, and we’ve already booked it for our anniversary!"

Blamed it on AirBnB said they don’t communicate well. When I showed them the text they still said no. They did text me at 3:45 saying they were happy to inform me I could get in early. Check in time was 3pm we were already sitting in the apartment.
They gave us unit 4C which was literally in the elevator lobby so you could hear everyone come and go. There were only shades on the windows so sun came in pretty easily in the morning.
Overall for what we paid I would not stay there again."

I read reviews about the noise from the Orangetheory downstairs but we didn’t hear it at all. The apartment had eye masks and ear plugs in cute decorative pouches just in case. The eye masks did come in handy because there are not black out curtains so it gets really bright in there in the morning!
Keurig machine with coffee options (including sweeteners) were there waiting for us in the very well stocked kitchen .

By the time we made it home that evening after 10pm they had made arrangements for us to move to another unit and the apartment was already pre heated. Our transfer to another unit across the hall was seamless and we went to bed nice and cozy. They even responded to us that evening to make sure we were all set.

Stayed a few nights",Really nice and spacious place. Only issue was we were right above orangetheory and woken up at 5:30am by loud music for their classes. Luckily we found the earplugs and used them the rest of the time. The elevator was also broken most of the trip but we were on the second floor so not a huge problem until we needed to bring down our luggage.

Stayed a few nights","We've stayed here two years in a row for a conference. Great location - right near coffee and restaurants and the river walking path. The place itself is solid - nothing fancy and no character to speak of (very bland and utilitarian), but just what you need for a conference. Beds very comfortable.
We had a few issues with checkin which i think reflected confusion between Mint House and Airbnb, and also the lift was broken for a full morning at least (for a 5th floor flat) which made coming and going that day extremely awkward (lots of stairs). Fortunately it was fixed in time for us getting to the airport with loads of suitcases.
Overall i'd say a good place with a few issues which aren't insurmountable, but good to be aware of if you book."

Stayed about a week","Be aware that this company is extremely corporate. This unit is obviously not someone's home that you are staying in. I canceled my reservation and re-booked less than 24 hours later and that mistake cost me $500 because they were not willing to honor the original price that I secured. There is about an inch of open space under all of the interior doors, making it easy to hear everything, and the place was echoey so it made it hard for people with hearing aids."

Two lefts leads you to downtown and all the shopping and eating you want to do. on the way to downtown try Bubble Tea (that tiger sugar boba tea was amazing!)
The rooms and layout were exactly as described, but the pictures of the furniture are not accurate. The headboards, sofa, rugs, chairs, trees/greenery are all different then pictured.
The bedding was amazing, very soft and clean (mattresses were wrapped in plastic covers [didn't make any noise though]) Each bed had at least six pillows on it.
Kitchen had wine glasses, regular glasses, plates, pans, pots, and utensils.
Elevator was very efficient and there was a luggage cart in the lobby area.
I would stay there again."

It's actually the Embassy Suites hotel parking garage and you can pretty much see it from the condo so it's really not a far walk at all. The hosts were very quick to answer all of our questions. We would definitely stay here again.

Stayed with kids","Great location for visiting Greenville, everything is in walking distance and the quick access to the park is nice. The apartment had a lot of room. The furniture was different than the picture but it was fine. The pictures are accurate. I was a little surprised about the build quality of the apartment for such a new building but the pictures reflect this. The place could use some better design elements but not really important for our stay. The coffee supplies are a nice touch.
PARKING TIP: Parking in front of the building is not allowed. there is a big underground lot across the street. To enter, drive across to the Hampton Inn front door and pass the valet stand. Immediately to your right is a down ramp into the parking garage. It is easy to miss. You can use Parkmobile to pay (or credit card) and it is not very expensive. It would be helpful if the Mint House team would include this in their welcome email since the entrance to the paring garage is not easy to find."

Stayed a few nights","This was my 2nd stay at a Mint House apartment. It was very clean and the apartment was as expected. The location is great for access to downtown Greenville. We parked the car when we arrived and didn’t use it again until we left! I will definitely stay there again on my next trip to Greenville.
Our only complaint was access to the fitness center. In our arrival instructions it said “24 hour fitness center” that was open from 10-5, but if you wanted to access it outside that time to let the management know and they would make arrangements. I emailed the day before our arrival to ask about getting access outside that window (10 seems very late to me as I am a morning exerciser) and never received a response. Then I asked when we arrived at the property and was told that the keypad entry was broken (and he made it sound like it had been for awhile) and there was no way for us to get in until someone from the management company arrived, generally between 9-10 am."

Stayed a few nights","We were visiting the area for the weekend and two out of our four days it poured rain. We were thrilled to have this extra roomy space and felt at home. The kitchen had everything you need to make a meal but the place is just a block away from an array of restaurants (and shopping). The space was clean and roomy. We had overlooked the note from the host that there was quiet time at 9pm on and the room had a sound decibel machine inside. Despite our concerns after reading this, we did not have any issues and did not hear any other guests in the building. We actually rarely saw anyone. The only down side, if it is one, is there is not onsite parking. This wasn't a problem as there is a parking garage across the street and the majority of our trip we walked to where we needed to go. The convenient location, spacious place, and accommodations were great! I'd definitely stay here again."

It was in a great location, close to downtown and the river, and had a nice kitchen and washer and dryer too! We only stayed for one night so it was perfect for what we needed. I saw comments about it being bright, and these were definitely true. It wasn’t just bright in the morning but also bright at night. There are huge windows with thin blinds and the street lights and big blue light from the front entrance all shine in. That being said, they do at least provide 2 little eye covers to wear while you sleep if you like to use those. My only other improvement I’d make is more living room seating. The beds would sleep 6 comfortably but you could really only seat 3-4 on the small couch and chair in the living room. Overall it was a great stay for what we needed!"

As John has mentioned, the apartment is above a vibrant restaurant. If noise is a concern at night I would avoid Apartment #1...especially on Friday and Saturday nights due to the late night bar crowd. Apartment #3 & #4 are further away from the street and the restaurant, and would be quieter."

Our only issue was that we were in apartment 1 which gets a LOT of noise from the bar below. At the weekend this made the front bedroom (as shown in the main photo) unusable until the bar closed. The bar music was also loud in the lounge area.
We’d happily stay again but only if we could book one of the other apartments in the block."

Stayed a few nights","We were two couples who stayed at this classic urban condo during Euphoria Festival weekend. The location was excellent and easy walking distance to all the events.
The condo is stylishly furnished and inviting.
We gave a four star rating instead of five for the following reasons:
the restaurant and bar below had noise and music all three nights until midnight. We were aware of this issue through the listing write up and reviews for the property but were left with the impression that the noise ended at 10 pm. The owners do provide ear plugs and sound machine which helps but does not eliminate the sound transfer all together.
The king beds are comfortable but the bottom sheets need deeper pockets as they keep coming off and we ended up sleeping on the mattress protector.
We left a note for the cleaning people
with a small list of other things that we felt you needed to be aware of.
Overall we were impressed with the condition of the unit and would recommend it."

If you are a night owl and out past midnight you will be fine in this apartment. If you like to be asleep by 10, stay somewhere else... even the back of the building in apartment 4 would probably be fine.
Living room furniture needs to be steam cleaned. Everything thing else was perfect, roomy, well appointed kitchen, convenient to everything. We absolutely will be back but we will try a unit at the back of the building in hopes of something more private."

Having a bathroom attached to each bedroom was wonderful along with a half bathroom in the main area for any guests. It was easy to make ourselves at home here and cook a couple meals in the huge kitchen while also being right downtown with ample dining options. The parking space was great to have! The white noise machines drown out any noise from the restaurant / bar downstairs and it was no issue for us, plus they’re closed on Sunday and Monday. We will definitely be back!"

The host did a great job with food and entertainment recommendations and the place is walkable to all of downtown Greenville, including the west side and Gather Greenville, a unique outdoor food hall. The view to outside from the common area window was awesome and with good natural light. Kitchen had a coffee Keurig coffee maker with pods and if you wanted to cook, you had everything you needed. Great for couple or small family. Bonus of extra half bathroom outside of the two bedrooms. Thankful we were in this location, as it was so convenient. Would definitely recommend to anyone seeing Greenville for the first time or returning. Across the street from a great speakeasy named Vault and Valor that I recommend. 😎"

Easy to get in and out of. Perfect location for walking to all sorts of activities in Greenville. If you are an orange theory enthusiast, it is practically right out the back door so I loved being able to get a workout in! Next time I come to town with my husband he’s going to want to stay at the new Grand Bohemian, but it’s going to be a fight because I would love to come back to this apartment (which is just a lovely walk from the GB to go enjoy the restaurant and bar). John was a very friendly and responsive host. Highly recommend! Would note that there is a busy and loud restaurant below, but there were white noise machines in the bedrooms so that even my light-sleeper travel companion was able to sleep through it."

Stayed a few nights","The condo was very nice, clean, in a great location, and professionally decorated. However, the sitting area was not very comfortable, with one sofa and 2 chairs that were not very comfortable. The bathrooms in the bedrooms had barn sliding doors that didn't close in a way that there was any privacy. I realize that we were located on Main Street and one must allow for noise at night, but the bar beneath us had no insulation from the sound below. We could hear distinct conversations like we were sitting in the bar. This is something to bear in mind when booking this property. Our group had 2 couples. We drove together and that was a good thing, because there was only one parking pass. If we drove separately, as we originally planned, one of us would have had to pay for parking. I think that is bad form, considering what we paid for the weekend."

Stayed with kids","Simply put, this condo is the literal definition of “amazing”!
This is a place we will 100% visit again, and again.
It’s spacious, super clean, and a wonderful design form when it was remodeled with exposed brick and concrete from its original build.
The furniture and decor were “magazine cover” stuff.
The location is right smack in the middle of downtown, short walk to Gather, short walk to the Bridge, and just as centrally located as it can be.
The icing on the cake, is that it faces South Main St. Your windows look out and over the street, and thus the downstairs entrance gives you a very unique entrance right off the sidewalk.
You’d be hard pressed to find a more beautifully designed and decorated place to stay that’s closer to the “center” of downtown Greenville."

Yes there was a small amount of noise from the restaurant below ( as stated by host) however the noise was minimal and was only during the early evening and did not impact our experience at all. Again I would highly recommended! Such a beautiful city. And so many great food options.

Stayed about a week","We booked this apartment for a 9 night stay. We arrived a few minutes after 3p which was the designated check in time. The cleaning person was still cleaning stating they were running behind and would need another 20 minutes. She allowed us to bring in the few bags of groceries we had as well as our luggage. It ended up taking her almost 45 minutes to finish up. Not a big deal but we were ready to relax after a 11 hour drive that started at 4a. The apartment was much larger than expected and decorated very nicely. Bedrooms and bathrooms were large. Kitchen was well appointed. We made breakfast in the apartment most mornings but there were enough pots, pans, etc to cook a full meal if wanted. The vibe of the apartment as well as the whole floor was super cool. My husband and I were both very pleased with the apartment. Loved the exposed bricks, wood floor and beams, as well as the huge windows in our unit. The unit has 3 TVs but no cable or satellite so you watch tv via apps. Took us awhile to get used to that but once we did it was ok. The location was good as well although admittedly we always found ourselves heading north when leaving thru the door on Main Street. We did head south a few times but most of what you will walk to is north and a reasonable walk. As I said both my husband and I were very pleased with the apartment. Free parking was a huge bonus too. The downside to the apartment is the excessive noise from the restaurant, Coral, below. Coral is a restaurant with a popular bar, which sits directly below this apartment. They don’t start playing music until mid afternoon. They don’t stop playing music until 11p or a few nights closer to midnight. The building being old without any sound proofing and the location of this apartment being right over the bar is not a good combo. You not only hear the very loud music, but you can also hear peoples conversations - not muffled, full conversations. Again that stops by midnight so if you aren’t wanting to be asleep before then probably not a problem for you. We got used to it but both of us were very frustrated the first couple of nights. The thing we could not get past is the cleaning people showing up at 5am to clean the restaurant - with a shop vac. It woke us up every single morning with the exception of Monday and Tuesday since they were closed on Sunday and Monday. Our first night we sat in the bar at Coral and ordered dinner. My husband was talking to who he thought was one of the employees about the noise level. Turns out it was one of the owners. They were very nice and comped our dinner because of the noise level. They also said that they know that there are frequent noise complaints from the renters staying in the apartments above but that they follow the city ordinance. Regardless of how nice the apartments are the noise from Coral below is just too much for us to return or recommend to anyone else. It’s a shame because the apartment really is terrific. There are 3 other apartments on the same floor so apartment #4 (which would be over the back of the restaurant) may be quieter."

Checking in was a breeze. I had a quick question and response was immediate.
Extremely clean, upscale, well stocked for cooking, and amazingly comfy!
Gorgeous windows in the living room and main bedroom. This made it very special having my coffee in the morning.
Oh, there are nice thick drapes so the sunshine won’t wake you up.
Bathrooms were sparkling and nice linens.
Since you are staying in a loft above Main Street it quiets down in the evening. Bring a box fan if you go to bed early.
However, you may wanna stay up and enjoy a nite cap while admiring the beautiful lights strung along the trees. Also, a great view to people watch.
Great location, coffee shops, dining, and shopping.

The recommendations they provided were spot on. We found what is now one of our favorite restaurants (the Anchorage) bc of their recommendation. Great location super close to downtown Greenville which we fell in love with. Would highly recommend staying here and we hope to be back!"

The studio apartment is very well decorated, maintained & cleaned.
The kitchen was functional, I wish the fridge was bigger , since I stayed over a week & didn’t eat meals outside.
The queen size bed is super comfy with enough extra blankets if needed.
Jessica responded promptly to my few requests.
Her husband came many times to clean up the terrace to remove the leaves , their son also came once to help his dad ( thank you).
The studio is located in a quiet & safe neighborhood, with a parking next to the house where my friend & I were able to park our cars with no issue until it was time to leave to go home."

And special shoutout to Paige, who cleans the place. We locked ourselves out (our fault!), and Paige saved the day by going to her house and getting the extra key! Truly above and beyond. Would absolutely rent again the next time we're in the area."

Stayed one night","Our stay here was wonderful! Everything was nice & clean, and anything that we could have needed for our stay was provided. The bed & the pillows we're comfortable. The Wi-Fi worked great, and the Roku TV had all the Streaming services we'd typically use. The Coffee maker was nice, as well as all of the other appliances, gadgets & furniture. The room is well lit, inside & outside, even the stairs! Plus shades when you need them. There was anything you could need to accommodate your stay, and more. The AC/Heater worked wonderfully, we were were never too hot or too cold. The shower was awesome as well, and we never ran out of hot water. Plus all of the Towels were nice. Everything was clean, the linens, towels, & the room itself smelled great. I have to say that the rugs were incredibly soft & plush, a minor detail but we absolutely loved them. Overall the studio was incredibly tidy, neat & clean. We truly enjoyed our stay here and would love to stay again in the future!"

The bed had one of the softest mattress we’ve ever slept on. The kitchen was perfect since we didn’t really go out to eat and the fireplace went great with our hot cocoa. Our host were amazing and kept us updated throughout our stay. We even visited falls park on the reedy which really made our trip worthwhile. We would definitely stay here again if we’re in the area and would recommend this place for anyone looking for a cabin experience without all the extra expenses.

It was a little noisy for us because the cabin backs up to a busy road, but I think it was because it was a Friday night and there aren't a lot of leaves on the trees this time of year. The cabin is adorable. The only thing that bothered us was the fact that the TV/Internet access was not working. Again, we were only there for the night so we didn't bother them. Overall, we enjoyed our stay !"

We appreciate ours hosts letting us come and go late each night as we were in town for a music festival. It was quiet well into the morning as we caught up on sleep."

Tony and Racquel are wonderful hosts. They provided clear instructions on how to find the place and how to get in. It is close to downtown and surrounding areas, so going out was extremely easy. The next time we are in Greenville, we hope we can stay at the cabin again."

Stayed one night","We enjoyed our stay. The hosts were very responsive.
Because I had looked for this information in the reviews and didn't see anyone mention it:
1) as you would expect of a historic cabin, there was a very slight musty smell. It went away as we got used to it during our stay, and it wasn't a reason for me to not book again. Just something I had wondered about before our stay and thought I would include for others wondering
2) the property is next to a busy highway. It got quieter in the late evening, but there's definitely traffic next to the property. You are still in a city, despite the rustic setting. Since we normally live in a rural area, I brought a fan for white noise, and that was all I needed to get a good night's sleep."

Stayed a few nights","We wanted to go to Greenville but not pay the high hotel prices. There were many other Air B&Bs listed but none were as reasonably priced, and we didn't need much space. We loved everything being in one room (except for the kitchen and bathroom!) The floor in the bathroom sloped a bit, but given that the cabin was built in the 1800s we considered it ""character""! I also loved the minimum check out requirements -- basically just run the dishwasher before leaving, and leaving used towels in a hamper. Usually we have to empty garbage and sometimes even strip the sheets. They really took care of everything else! We also loved the privacy and coziness. If we visit Greenville again we will definitely stay there!"

Stayed one night","It's immediately clear that this is an old place, but it is very well kept and super charming and comfortable! There is plenty of outdoor seating and scenery, though the one night my bf and I stayed, we stayed hidden away in the cozy and comfortable cottage. Though the bathroom was small, it was done up very nicely and had plenty of fresh towels available. The little kitchen also had everything, including a dishwasher, stove and wall oven. I don't remember if the bnb is pet friendly but we thought it was very cool that there was a big doggy door on the door leading to the side yard with the outdoor seating. The bed was super comfortable and had luxurious bedding. Also was delighted to see a functioning fireplace with wood handy!
As a local, it was a perfect couples retreat, a nice place to escape within the city. Will definitely return and 100% recommend. Nat 20s for hospitality! Thank you Tony and Racquel!"

When we checked out, the host was quick to let me know that I had left my jewelry there on the nightstand, and they worked hard to make sure that it was returned.

The bed was very comfortable, the kitchen was stocked, everything was very clean. Check in and check out were easy and there’s plenty of space for parking. We only came in for a concert, but had I known this town and this cabin was as cute as it was we would’ve stayed longer.
I would definitely stay there again."

I was surprised at the amount of road noise (even when inside watching TV). Probably not a dealbreaker for most people, but I wanted to mention it because I combed reviews looking for any mention of noise and saw none."

Stayed a few nights","My hubby and I truly enjoyed our stay in this charming, cozy cabin. It was so well decorated and full of everything we needed. The towels smelled like fresh lavender and were so thick and soft. I felt like I was in a spa! The bed was super comfy. We slept like babies. The coffee bar was fully stocked with good quality coffee. We were there to cycle the Swamp Rabbit Trail and it was easy access from this location. Tony and Racquel sent us a list of great recommendations. We enjoyed several of those… a walk through Falls Park, pizza from D’Allasandro’s, the Swamp Rabbit Cafe, White Duck Taco, and breakfast at Tandem Creperie & Coffeehouse in Traveler’s Rest. We couldn’t have picked a better spot for our 24th anniversary weekend. Our only regret was that it was too hot to use the awesome fire pit area and that there wasn’t a grill. Highly recommend!!"

Actually more than we needed!! I had an issue with the door look and reached out to Erin and she replied immediately. Even sent someone to the unit. Realized it was my own stupidity and I still can’t apologize enough for that. But Erin didn’t seem to mind at all! 100% will stay here again and again! Thank you again Erin for the wonderful stay!"

We were in town for a concert at the Bon Secours Wellness Center and Erin's place is PERFECT! Just a short 5 minute walk. It made it great for going to the show! And we were able to enjoy her deck before the show! Overall, just an amazing experience! And little touches, like the blanket on the bed being folded in a flower pattern, and the same with the toilet paper. Love love love it!"

Stayed a few nights","We had a lovely time exploring Greenville & Erin’s place (top floor unit) was a great home base for a few days!
We appreciated the central location and personal touch of some sweet Christmas decorations; nice Roku TV and the electric fireplace was cozy.
Plenty of closet space with hangers & a nice chest of drawers in the br.
Updated, functional and full kitchen & coffee setup (Nespresso & old-school pot).
Solid shower setup with stationary shampoo, conditioner, body wash & black washcloths for makeup.
Amazing hot water & shower-head pressure and lots of towels!
Considerations: As other reviewers have noted, there are sirens in the area so use a white noise app/machine or bring a fan to help sleep. The bed is pretty firm, so if you prefer a softer mattress, just a consideration :)
All in all, good spot!"

Everything was hotel quality or better, plus it was in a quiet neighborhood yet still close to downtown.

The only complaint I had - and is no fault of the hosts themselves - is that the location is right off the main interstate that runs into downtown Greenville. I am a light sleeper and there is a quite noticeable amount of road noise all night in that area, so I had to sleep with earplugs. Other than that the location is great for getting around to the great food and entertainment that is downtown. Would definitely recommend (for heavier sleepers than I am)"

Stayed a few nights","The unit was exactly as pictured and well cleaned, although the carpet has significant stains and probably should be replaced. Access to the unit was easy and Amy was very responsive any time I had a question. On site parking was easily accessed through the alley and felt very secure. In our opinion, access to downtown is not convenient. The fastest route to Main Street takes about 15 minutes but forces you to use the narrow sidewalk directly next to a very busy three lane road. Selecting the “neighborhood route” to the Riverwalk is quieter and more pleasant than but takes about 30 minutes. If you plan on spending significant time downtown, this may not be the best location if you prefer to walk. The unit also backs up to that same busy three lane road (the feeder ramp to I385) making it very noisy for sleeping. With the bedroom on the back of the house, traffic noise is pretty much constant all night long."

Stayed a few nights","Conveniently located close to downtown but a little longer than the stated 10m walk. Nothing to do in the immediate area unless you’re visiting 1 of many lawyers with offices there. You approach the unit from an unattractive alley in the back of the building up 3 flights of stairs. The house is not marked on the back but instructions helped me find it. The unit has alot of natural light which makes it cheery but could use some room-darkening shades in the bedroom which overlooks a busy highway. Fairly clean although the carpeting is old and stained in places. Spacious bathroom with good water pressure although I was freaked out when I found a huge palmetto bug one morning. The hosts said they had never seen one there, and they used preventive measures. I’m not from SC, but was told a rain event which we had the night before may have triggered it. Upon arrival there was no guidebook with recommendations but upon request the host put one together. Overall, an ok stay for a good price."

Very nice and clean, beautiful views in front, a little creaky and a teeny but musty. I am very sensitive to that, though.
All rooms are super spacious, lovely non wood fireplace, great shower, kitchen well appointed.
Overall a great stay!"

My kids didn’t want to leave, they wanted to stay on vacation in that house. The care and beauty, the downloadable guest book that had over and above instructions to make you feel at home and know exactly what to do and how, to the comfortable bedding and beds, every aspect of this home was stellar. It’s immaculate and you can’t really quantify peace for those who travel

We walked to and from downtown daily during the mornings, afternoons and evenings and felt safe during our travels and with our accommodations.
Parking is a little challenging due to very narrow and cracked driveway but once you get the hang of it, you will have not problem. We Ubered to some restaurants and places that were farther out since we didn't want to drive at night. Quick and easy to use Uber.
We would not hesitate to book a return visit."

I would absolutely stay here again simply to see what they did with the other parts because it was just amazing. It’s SO CLOSE to downtown too, a less than 5 min drive, so when we went out & came home Ubers were cheap! & most definitely worth the price for all the things they have for you.

Stayed a few nights","This Airbnb unit (Unit 1) has large, spacious rooms in a nicely renovated historic house. The listing pictures are accurate. There is more than one unit in this structure. There are 2 things to note if both bedrooms are used: 1) one of the full baths is right off the kitchen downstairs and 2) the back bedroom is a half-flight down from the upstairs full bathroom which may prove a little tricky during nocturnal trips! The listing does describe this somewhat. The neighborhood is quiet except for the street noise coming from I-385 which is a block behind the house. Cleveland Park with an entrance to the Swamp Rabbit Trail is 4 blocks away. Downtown is about a 15-minute easy walk. Parking in the private lot behind the house is good. Turning left off I-385 into the neighborhood took some time during rush hour(s) so it's good to plan for alternate routes. Entry and check-out instructions were easy. Erin was responsive during the stay. Note: early check-in may be available for a fee."

There was plenty of space for our family of four to relax together or apart when we weren't walking to the park & zoo or restaurants & sites downtown.
The bathrooms both have bath/showers so there wasn't a line to get ready in the morning or for getting ready to go out for the evening.
Plus, there was a full kitchen with separate dining space for the mornings, which came in handy for our impromptu leftover magic breakfast with fresh eggs and leftovers from Fork and Plough.
Of course, we can't forget to mention the Nespresso coffee machine, which definitely got some use since the closest coffee shops appeared to closed on the weekends.
Thanks for having us, Adam and Abby!"

Stayed one night","From the get go Jimmy was very proactive and friendly! Gave us great recommendations for local events and places to eat. Our apartment unit was on the 2nd floor-- I didn't realize that I probably overlooked that on app), but it was not an issue.
I loved and appreciated the fact that there is art on the walls to purchase! What a phenomenal place to showcase!! I also really appreciated that Jimmy included local menus and guidebooks for the area.
The apartment is adorable. There was some traffic noise, as this location is right on a Main street, however with the AC and ceiling fan on we only heard the occasional ambulance. Being near a hospital that is to be expected.
The double sided brick fireplace and gorgeous wooden mantle is a sweet call back to yesteryear.
This unit is minutes from the cute Zoo. We ordered in from Willy Tacos. Enjoyed a wonderful lunch at The Bohemian Cafe.
Thank you Jimmy for the wonderful host that you are. Hope to be back in Greenville soon!"

Stayed one night","I wish we could have stayed longer! The unit was the perfect size for two people - especially as we spent most of our time walking around the city. We got to pretend we had an adorable unit in the city complete with a view of the skyline. The local art in the unit and the house was awesome, and there were plenty of pamphlets, restaurant guides, and even board games at our disposal. Jimmy was super responsive and so accommodating! If we ever visit Greenville again, I know where we’ll stay :)"

This was my second time staying in one of the units in the house. Location is good . It’s about a 15-20 min walk to the part of Main Street where restaurants and stores start. House has parking in the back if you have a car. Jimmy very responsive to questions and happy to help with suggestions for things to do or places to eat .

The space had everything I needed for a short stay and parking in the back. 10/10!

Con’s: First impression not great—overgrown yard and porch needed a bit of TLC. Bathroom, pillows and linens could benefit by some updating.

Stayed with a pet","We had a mostly nice stay at this Airbnb while visiting Greenville for a week. The location is extremely convenient for visiting downtown. The air conditioner ran very cold during our heat wave week with temperatures over 95° which was needed. The entryway to the house was nice with lots of character.
Some downsides - being a pretty small place there’s no place to sit besides the bed or one chair, or at the kitchen table. Sometimes the Wi-Fi was a little choppy which was a problem for working remotely. The chairs on the front porch were majorly in need of fresh paint. But probably the main creepy downside was the appearance of four huge cockroaches scurrying over the walls and floor two nights while we were lying in bed watching TV. These things took multiple shoe smacks to take down. I killed three back to back one evening and flushed them in the toilet in the morning and was very amazed to find them still alive, their little legs squirming as they traveled down the white rapids of the toilet bowl into the sewer. My girlfriend nearly had a heart attack and then we were worried that a night time trip to the bathroom would result in the crunch of a roach body underfoot from guest yet unseen. I know this is the south and these little guys are locals, but I would be remiss if I didn’t mention the gross out encounter. Other than that this was a nice stay!"

Stayed a few nights","Everything at Jimmy’s was easy and just as expected. He made check-in a piece of cake and we enjoyed being just on the north end of downtown. We didn’t discover the parking in the back of the building until our last day (we also didn’t think to ask), but it didn’t matter because the street parking is also abundant and (as far as I could tell) unregulated right on the next block."

Cons: Not walking distance to the Falls/downtown shops, no frills, kitchen was bare. Overall, we slept well and had no major complaints. The host communicated well and check-in was easy."

Stayed over a week","Well located near local restaurants and a residential historical district this 2 room unit + bathroom has most of what you need for a short term or long term stay. I found the unit perfect for my needs over a month. Even though it is an older building it is clean, with no signs of bugs the whole time I was there and the charm of the building and neighborhood reminded me of Los Angeles. It is a little close to a busy intersection, but I personally did not find that bothersome or the traffic noise disruptive. It felt safe. The host is on top of everything and very knowledgeable about the city as a whole. Would definitely stay here again."
