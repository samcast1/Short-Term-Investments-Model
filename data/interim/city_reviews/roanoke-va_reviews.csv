The cabin is very cozy, the bed in the primary bedroom is one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in at an AirBnB! The stairs to the loft are quite steep, so be careful. Highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","Kathleen's place was exactly what I needed to recharge after driving from Long Island. It was peaceful, comfortable and pretty, inside and out, with several decks overlooking the creek. I loved the interior of the cabin, and it was perfectly clean. The adjustable bed, complete with massager, was incredible! Kathleen went above and beyond to give the cabin special touches. Arriving to calming jazz was wonderful and began a relaxing first evening. I mostly stayed at the house because it was so enjoyable, but I also enjoyed hiking some of the less popular area trails like Poor Mountain Preserve which offered a spectacular overlook very soon into the trail. The long staircase from the road to the house felt like a lot upon arrival in pouring rain, but I loved it on the way out - a great workout! I enjoyed being surrounded by nature - felt much further from the main road than it was! Kathleen was quick to answer questions and very hospitable and helpful. I'm glad I chose this spot!"

Not a problem for us but that is the only thing I could think could be a issue for someone. Deer roaming around the area constantly and decks that overlook the creek. I've stayed in a lot of Airbnb's and I'd put this one with the best.

The adjustable bed is super-comfortable; I'm thinking of getting one for my bedroom. The cabin is very close to stores, restaurants, etc., but once you turn onto Crystal Creek Drive, you enter a lush green paradise. Our only regret is that the weather was so hot that we couldn't sit out on the decks - maybe next time!"

We saw 3 deer playing in the creek the first night of our stay. We also saw ducks and chipmunks right outside of the cabin.
Kathleen was such a great host. She gave us some wonderful recommendations for local restaurants and phenomenal hikes in the area. She also had music playing in the cabin for us when we arrived which was a really nice touch. Overall, we had a wonderful stay and would def book again."

Thought the house might be a bit more secluded, but there is a house almost directly across the creek. Not a huge deal, but slightly detracted from the views from the deck. Overall, a lovely stay and would return if we're in the area again."

Although it's not far from a major road and businesses, it feels a great deal more remote overlooking a babbling creek and down a slope from the road. The bed was very comfortable (and we didn't even make use of the adjustable settings), the walk in shower beautiful slate tile, the towels thick and luxurious, the kitchen well stocked and several decks around the house to enjoy. Really just a gem of an AirBnB"

Stayed a few nights","Highly recommend this beautiful place. Well stocked, sparkling clean, attention to detail throughout. If you are looking for a quiet place with modern luxuries and a cabin feel this place is perfect. Important to note: low ceiling in loft. Our 15 year old was fine with it but some adults might not be; entrance stairs - not a problem unless you don’t do stairs well and then getting inside would be a challenge; sofa bed - 22 year old found it slightly uncomfortable but it’s a sofa bed. The layout took advantage of all of the space, giving us plenty of room to spread out. Kitchen was gorgeous. Loved the use of the old cabin in the design and generally fell in love with the place as a whole!"

Great hiking options around that we didn’t have to go too far out of the way for. We took full advantage of the lower porch where we had drinks and just listened to the creek. Overall worth every penny and would probably stay there again if we find ourselves in the area.

It's pure perfection and we're already looking at dates so we can return! From the historic charm to the incredible view of the creek, from the thoughtful touches and a cleanliness level that would allow you to eat off the floor to the fact you're close to everything but feel a world away, this place is a gem worthy of 5 stars! Do not hesitate to book this cabin. You won't regret it. You just won't want to leave!"

Stayed a few nights","Kathleen and Billy provide a beautiful, rustic cabin that is a great stay for people visiting the Roanoke area. It is close to the city, but is also in such a forested area that deer frequent the property!!! All rooms are beautifully decorated.
One thing to note is that the house is only accessible by stairs which descend from the road down to the front of the cabin.
Such a beautiful cabin for anyone wanting to relax in a woodsy area."

The cleanliness of the home. The location. Everything was top notch. I also want to point of that we did not see a single bug during our 3 day stay. Considering the location, that is almost unbelievable. We will definitely be back!"

Stayed a few nights","Very cute place with a lot of history. The house is located in a secluded private spot on a creek, but minutes away from main road, shopping, etc. Location is very convenient. The house has all the necessities and stylishly decorated. Kitchen and bathroom are newly renovated, with modern amenities. The main bedroom is comfortable and air-conditioned. However, for those wanting to use the loft, it was extremely hot and stuffy in June, with no air flow. No AC up there. Very cute for kids, with the right temperatures. The outdoor decks are what also makes this house stand out. Very beautiful and relaxing. WiFi connection was very unreliable when we were there, hopefully that's all fixed now. Overall, a cute and memorable place, with style!"

Stayed a few nights","I have stayed at the Falling Pines Cabin many times. Not only is the location amazing (feel like you are in the middle of nowhere but right around the corner there is everything you need...grocery, pharmacy, restaurants, etc.) but the ambiance and beauty of the place is unparalleled. The cabin is always spotless when I arrive and there was even classical music playing when I entered. I enjoy sleeping with the Master balcony door open to fall asleep to the sounds of the creek and the evening.
I had an accident off site and ended up with a broken rib from it. I let them know and they checked on me daily and even took out the trash for me! I love Kathleen and Billy, very kind and super hosts! The adjustable bed was perfect for 5 days of rest. Unfortunately, I didn't get to accomplish what I came to VA for (my elderly parents nearby) but it was almost like a vacay anyway just to recover in the cabin.
There are still wonderful people in the world. They are some of the best!"

The loft/bedroom is tiny, with a very low sloped ceiling. Our five year old loved it, but it was uncomfortable for adults. They aren't kissing when they say it's not suitable for small children--the steps are gorgeous but open, and the railing is partially blocked by a rafter beam. There are also many steps down to the cabin. We loved sitting out on the lower deck by the creek."

One day we also enjoyed driving up to Natural Bridge and checked out some caves. Definitely check out downtown for a night also.

Stayed a few nights","Our trip to Falling Pines Historic Cabin was wonderful! It was peaceful and relaxing. Kathleen and Billy were excellent, thoughtful hosts. We were greeted with a personal note and cookies- a warm welcome after the drive to get to the cabin. The cabin is located not far outside of Roanoke, but felt like we were in the quiet of the woods up the mountainside. The three decks provided ample outdoor space, which we could enjoy in the unusually warm winter days. The babbling brook is so peaceful and we really enjoyed the views every day from the many windows in the living room. We used the full kitchen to our advantage, cooking all are meals and using the grill. All the basic kitchen pans/gadgets/cutlery were available to use, and of course, the essential wine glasses. The bed was super comfortable, and the bedding soft. We loved staying in this historical cabin and would definitely stay here again. Kathleen and Billy were easily reachable and answered any questions we had before and during our stay. You will not regret your stay there!
Though our primary goal was hibernation and relaxation, we did venture out for a fabulous hike on Dragon's Tooth in Catawba, about a 30 minute drive. It's a 5 mile out-and-back hike, decent difficulty, and fantastic views."

Stayed about a week","I can’t say enough good things about this cabin! My friend and I stayed here for a week. The wifi was great - I was able to do many hours of zoom calls with no problem. The cabin was sparkling and location was peaceful. We enjoyed all decks and cooking in the fully stocked kitchen. Trails on the AT were only about a 30 min drive - we did McAfee’s Knob, Dragon’s Tooth, and Tinker Cliffs via Andy Layne. Downtown Roanoke area about 15 mins - check out The River & Rail restaurant for amazing food and Sweet Donkey for great coffee! I would absolutely come back here again — definitely a highlight of 2020 for me."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I had delayed taking a summer vacation this year and decided to make it a fall getaway instead. We were looking for a comfortable place to get out of the city and enjoy the outdoors. Kathleen and Billy's cabin was absolutely perfect! They have thought of every last detail to make you feel at home, including welcoming us with delicious cookies and soft sounds of jazz. This year, in particular, I was concerned about staying in a place that was freshly cleaned and I was not disappointed. The cabin was spotless and had had a thorough cleaning before our arrival. We hiked McAfee Knob, Dragon's Tooth, and the Star trail at Mill Mountain Park while we were there and all were an easy 20-30 min. drive from the cabin. Our favorite part of the cabin was the THREE outdoor decks which overlook the creek and make it easy to enjoy the wonderful wooded setting surrounding the cabin. The kitchen is very well stocked and we had no problem making all of our dinners while staying there. A week in this cabin was exactly what we needed and I'm sure we will be back again!"

Our favorite parts were the deck by the creek, the updated, well-stocked kitchen, the little touches around the house, and Kathleen and Billy's hospitality (they live right across the street and were willing to lend us a small kitchen appliance that we forgot to bring from home). We even saw deer just like the picture on the Airbnb profile. The cabin is cozy but we were able to make it work with 4 people thanks to the pull-out couch. Thank you so much Billy and Kathleen!"

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I enjoyed our 2 night stay here while we hiked parts of the Appalachian Trail, including Dragon’s Tooth. One evening we went to Parkway Brewing Company (which is just a short drive from the cabin) where they had a live band, outdoor seating, and a food truck. The cabin was very clean and is a fun unique place to stay. One thing I really liked about staying here was that there was plenty of counter space to put my toiletries, hair stuff, etc. The bathroom has a good sized windowsill to set things on and the room directly outside of the bathroom has a tall dresser with a mirror and a bench. I can’t help but bring a lot of toiletries on trips and it is annoying when you have no where to put them for easy access during your stay. But this place was percent for that. Bed was comfortable. Really a nice cabin."

Most of the things to check out in town are an easy walking distance. Getting anywhere by car is easy as the streets layout is pretty simple. Corey was even kind enough to leave a coupon for a local establishment.

It was spacious, cozy and very easy to feel right at home in. It was walkable to several coffee shops and restaurants. Unfortunately, it was extremely cold and snowy the weekend we visited, so that limited how much time we spent exploring. But it ended up working out great because being inside was so relaxing. We had no complaints - the couch was comfortable, we could spread out and enjoy movies and TV and watch the snow fall. We would absolutely stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","Came to check out the Roanoke area as a place to retire. We live in Chicago and Amtrak started daily service to DC so, we could easily go for a week if we wanted to see a show or exhibit. Corey's place was just a short walk from the station and since the train normally gets in at 10:30pm the location was ideal.
In the morning the location was even better. A short walk to breakfast and then to the farmer's market. Even with the rain we strolled around the area talking to shop owners, walked along the river, and to Elmwood Park.
The apartment was wonderful. Everything I expected from the listing. I did leave a dim light on to light the (two) stairs to the bathroom as a precaution. We didn't really do any cooking as we wanted to eat out and experience downtown on the only night we were in Roanoke.
If I was coming to the area for an extended visit and wanted a place near some great hiking, road or mountain biking that had a decent restaurants and nightlife, I'd stay at Corey's again."

Stayed with kids","This was a great place for us to stay for the Go Cross Cyclocross Race. It was only a 10 minute bike ride to the park. It's also 10 minutes from the greenway trails. You can see the transportation museum and the center in the square from the huge windows. Easily the best view I've ever seen at an AirBnb. It's a 5 block walk to the center in the square. There are almost too many restaurants to choose from. The farmers market is fantastic on Saturday mornings. The building is cozy, safe, and easy to access. The hardwood floors are gorgeous, and the pool table was a great feature."

Stayed one night","I really debated on a 4 star vs 5 star rating for one reason. THE NOISE. I heard every step my neighbors took (the floors in my place and theirs's squeaked with every single step), I heard every word they said, EVERYTHING. At one point the floors were squeaking so much, I blocked the bedroom door to make sure no one was coming into the room I was sleeping in. The walls must have been made with newspaper. If you want a quiet undisturbed night of sleep this is NOT the place for you. If you just need a bed for a night and don't mind the noise this is a perfect spot.
Everything else about this stay was amazing. Corey was very proactive and even had a small gift card waiting for me to a brewery I was already going on. The room was super nice. The bed was comfy with tons of pillows. The bathroom was clean and had good toilet paper which is nice. The place and parking was a little confusing to find but I just parked in the parking garage next door for $8 a day."

Stayed a few nights","Corey was most attentive host we have encountered. Examples: we needed an extra day after the original booking and Corey obliged immediately, this move involved a need for luggage storage which Corey provided, personal recommendations for restaurants and events, and finally an unanticipated change of unit was painlessly navigated.
Beyond these larger issues his attention to the smallest details was exemplary. Immaculate rooms, breakfast beverages provided, hair dryers, irons, even tooth picks and cleaning supplies provided.
The only caveat we would offer has nothing to do with Corey. The gorgeous wooden floors, which appear to have been retained from the building conversion, are “creaky” and the walls are apparently quite thin. This may be problematic for light sleepers. We used a white noise machine.
Corey’s attention to both large and small details will keep us returning."

Hopefully it’s just an unfortunate one off."

We walked to Big Lick Brewing & we ordered our meal from the Burger place next door & they delivered the food to our spot & the bar for free! The food was delicious too! Then we walked back to the apartment & shot a few games of pool for a while which was a lot of fun!!"

Corey is always extremely friendly, helpful and responds quickly. It’s very accommodating with WiFi, Streaming services, extra towels, soap/conditioner/shampoo, cookware and stuff for coffee. I’ve stayed at previous air bnbs that did not offer as much for the price they charged. Also one of the cleanest I’ve stayed in. Very well kept and well equipped for anyone! Thank you for hosting me again, looking forward to coming back!"

Great location within walking distance to all of our planned activities for the day. Corey went above and beyond by offering to return clothes that I had accidentally left behind in the unit.
Highly recommend Martin's bar for delicious food as well as nightly events such as live music, trivia and more.
Center in the Square is enough for a full day of fun without ever leaving the building, although you should definitely enjoy lunch on the rooftop. Possibly from one of the restaurants in the City Market building? Definitely something for everyone to enjoy."

Stayed with kids","Very clean, spacious 1 bedroom. I had a teen with me who slept on the couch and he had no complaints.
My only recommendation is to arrive during daylight unless you have studied the back alley entrance on the map beforehand. Parking is challenging when you arrive at night. We could have stayed in the driveway with the other vehicle that belongs to an upstairs resident. But, was worried somehow we were blocking them in and needed to see the exit route opportunities.
But, the owner communicated all of this ahead of time. It’s just that having not seen it before AND arriving late at night made it challenging. But it all worked out. Would def stay again."

Stayed a few nights",Bob's place was very comfortable and in a great location. I enjoyed many walks to the Green Way and found a great spot to sit on the river. I did have to point out some housekeeping issues but feel that he will take care of it. I would suggest some porch and deck furniture to sit on. You have a beautiful deck that would be great to have some morning coffee on if you had a table and chairs. Maybe something for privacy too as you are right on top of your neighbors. A side table next to your beautiful tub would be good to set items you are using in the tub. If you are a light sleeper defiantly bring a sound machine because you are in the Grandin area and it can be a little noisy with cars and people doing yard work. It was a much needed time away and the home was very enjoyable!! Thank you!

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our time here and would readily recommend it. But here are a few tips if you stay here:
1. If the kitchen faucet suddenly loses pressure, press the toggle switch on the nozzle and you'll get a full stream again.
2. Bring along a white noise machine or ear plugs in case someone is staying on the second level.
3. If the occupants of the other unit don't park far enough forward in the drive, simply drive around the block to the alley and park in the back. The keypads on the back door (off the deck) are same as the front.
4. If you don't want water everywhere in the bathroom, simply put a bath sheet on the floor under the clear glass wall and aim the rain shower head away from the tub.
5. If you are staying here in winter, the bathroom will feel colder than the rest of the house, but the toilet seat is heated!
6. Last (but not a ""tip""): the bed is quite soft.
This really was a great place to stay. Just follow my tips to make it better!"

The babbling creek that you hear through the open windows, the beautiful mallard duck swimming around, the charming antique cabin, the well stocked kitchen, the soft linens, the comfy couch that I curled up in with my glass of wine and a bill. The amazing host left us a beautiful home cooked breakfast. The firewood was stocked and we used it for the creek-side fire as well as the wood stove that we chose to warm the house. The host also found out that it was my birthday and left me cupcakes and a balloon at the top of the stairs. Her home felt “like our home”. I want to go back. It may be the reason I fly back to Roanoke in the future. This cabin is SO beautiful and romantic. I wish there were more than 5 stars I could give it. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"

Stayed about a week","This was the most relaxing trip we've ever been on. We came out to celebrate our anniversary/ take our honeymoon and we could not have been more pleased. When we came in the windows were open, letting in the fresh air and babbling brook sounds from the backyard. Peaceful music was playing on the Alexa in the kitchen. We weren't there for 10 minutes and the relaxing had begun.
Everything about the cabin was amazing. There were abundant windows to let in the fresh mountain air. The creek in the back was home to ducks aplenty, and a great blue heron we had fun looking for each morning.
Lucy left breakfast for us, and stopped by a few days later with more! She was respectful of our time and space and was gone before we even knew she was there. And the food was AMAZING. If she leaves you a frittata, eat it! It was delicious!
Last but certainly not least, that bathtub. I told my husband no less than 4 times that we need one of those. Already thinking of renting next year! 100/10"

Stayed a few nights","Book this cabin! It’s hard to find the words to explain - you have to experience this cabin yourself. My favorite part was constantly being surprised by a new discovery in each room and outside. Lucy has created the most unique airbnb we have ever visited. We slept with the windows open - felt like we were camping but with luxurious bedding. And - We were visited by a Heron on the rocks below the porch - watching him hunt up close was very special. We sat and talked about every nook and cranny that has been thoughtfully crafted and is generously shared. Lucy prepared a wonderful breakfast of fresh fruit, frittatas and danishes, so appreciated. We wish we had more time. A great memory with our VT daughter. Thank you!"

She had such a yummy breakfast waiting there for us to enjoy. Delicious Pumpkin & Blueberry Muffins, Frittatas, and Berry Parfaits. Lucy does things up right! The moment you walk in you’re surrounded with eclectic decor that is beautiful staged. The soft music playing in the background just makes this cottage that much cozier. Absolutely loved this place!"

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at the magical cabin was nothing short of amazing. Lucy was the most hospitable host we have ever experienced and the cabin itself is truly perfect. When we arrived she made sure we had breakfast for the next morning as well snacks throughout our stay, fresh flowers on the counter, and the most amenities I’ve ever seen at an Airbnb. The views from all windows, the deck, the fire pit, were all incredible. You can expect to see a plethora of squirrels, chipmunks, fish, deer, and ducks! We could have sat with the binoculars all day, played the games she provided, or just simply lounged around the cabin. It was the perfect place to spend our babymoon and where we also got engaged (yay!). We cannot thank Lucy enough for letting us experience her lovely home."

Stayed about a week","I can’t say enough about how wonderful this peaceful sanctuary was. I just retired after over 35 years of teaching high school, and I wanted a fairy tale refuge where I could sit in silence and beauty. Lucy’s place did that and so much more. I sat by the babbling brook and read and watched all the wildlife going about their peaceful lives. I sat in the coziest of chairs and listened to the running water just outside the window. A close drive to Roanoke, I went on hikes and strolled along the Roanoke greenway path. Lucy provided the most delicious home-baked goods and I felt like I had my own personal nana making sure I was fed and comfortable. The space was decorated with impeccable taste. And the nights! Oh my. Sleeping in that cozy bed, listening to the creek outside the window…well, I never wanted to leave. Thank you, Lucy, for creating and sharing your piece of paradise with us all."

Stayed a few nights","We highly recommend Luci's truly magical cabin. From the moment we arrived, we fell in love with the cabin and the peaceful setting. As close as it is to the main roads, stores, and other city amenities, it felt like a world apart down there. We spent the first hour or so just exploring every interesting detail inside and outside. It is one of the most well-equipped lodgings I've ever stayed at. The breakfast goodies delivered by Luci and the other treats she provided were delicious. She was also a super host, promptly responding to any questions we had both before and after arrival. On one of the days during our stay, the smoke from Canadian wildfires kept us from venturing out on one of our excursions. So we stayed at the cabin the entire day and didn't mind one bit. Just being there felt like a vacation. Thank you Luci for creating a wonderful experience for us."

The creek is the perfect place to swim and chill on a hot day, and the fire pit with Adirondack chairs makes for a great hangout when the sun goes down. Beware though, the driveway is really tight, even for our mid size suv! Lucy is a great host, and clearly enjoys sharing this place. She puts a lot of effort into making sure her guests feel welcome. We really enjoyed our time in Roanoke and the surrounding area, and cant wait to visit again!"

She truly went above and beyond to make our stay the most relaxing and memorable that it could be! Most of all, we loved our time by the deck, listening to the rushing creek and watching the birds fly by. We enjoyed breakfast in the sunroom over the creek with the windows open and then dinners on the outside deck, overlooking the creek--perfection! She provided all that we needed and so many extras that it just made us feel loved and welcomed into her magical cabin! This is one of those places that you won't regret staying at! Until next time, Lucy!"

Stayed a few nights",We could not have asked for a better birthday getaway. The lovely location along the creek feels so remote but there were grocery stores and good food options less than 10 minutes away. It was a great home base for a day trip along the Blue Ridge Parkway and to Floyd. Would have worked equally as well for downtown Roanoke but we enjoyed the peaceful tranquility too much to leave the cabin very often. The decor is beautiful and all the food Lucy left was wonderful. With the sound of the creek in the background I got the best night’s sleep I’d had in weeks. Highly recommend this cabin experience!!

Stayed a few nights","Simply delightful! My husband and I decided to stay at Lucy’s place for our 1st wedding anniversary and it did not disappoint! From the moment we arrived from our long trip, we felt at home and welcome. From the music playing to a special anniversary treat! We absolutely loved having coffee and afternoon tea on the outside porch as well as the comfy chairs in the dining porch. A huge plus was that Lucy made an absolutely delicious breakfast frittata and also provided fruit and muffins. The sounds of the creek and viewing the wildlife were more than relaxing and it was an absolute delight to sleep with the windows open. I have difficulty sleeping especially when outside of my own home but I have to say that I slept very well at Lucy’s home. The creeks sounds to the super comfortable bed and linens made for a fabulous nights sleep! By far, this was the most relaxing vacation I have had and we so appreciated Lucy sharing this gem with us. Thank you Lucy for making our anniversary special!"

It feels isolated and secluded yet is less than 15 minutes from great restaurants, activities, and hiking.
It feels like every beautiful detail has been meticulously planned and currated yet it is completely relaxed and welcoming.
We were there during a really cold week and still enjoyed fires by the creek and coffee on the deck overlooking the water while wrapped in cozy blankets strategically left by Lucy, who is a host beyond compare. She did everything to ensure our time was top-notch. She has a real gift for creating stunning spaces that make for a great getaway. You'll be hard pressed to find a better spot in Roanoke."

In the description Lucy says convenient to everything but feels miles away, that was so accurate! The cottage is a gem. sitting out on.the porch and listening to the creek was relaxing.
The house is full of surprises and knick knacks it was like living in a fairy garden or a magic shop. You could walk from room to room and never get bored and you will always see something new. Delightful.
And even still among all the collections you feel comfortable and at home. The house is just wonderful.
Lucy was easy to communicate with and made the best breakfast. She loves her home and it shows by the way she welcomes and treats her guests.
This was a perfect getaway and I would visit again."

Stayed a few nights","This unique, quirky cabin was built in 1939 as a fishing cabin. The rafters and beams are constructed of repurposed box cars -you can still see the commercial printing on the wood.
We enjoyed a few nights here with a lovely view of Back Creek whose tumbling water filled the cabin with soothing sounds. The tranquil melody of the creek helped us drift off to sleep each night. Off the deck in the distance, we saw a bear cub and Herons. In the mornings we saw loads of ducks swimming.
Entering the cabin is like stepping into another in time. Most of the living space is on the main floor with a small upstairs ""attic"" bedroom, which has its own charm. The house is beautifully decorated, filled with unusual items—many dealing with fairies, tree spirits and wood nymphs- your eye never rests as you sit in the living room and try to take it all in.
Lucy is an ideal host. She left us muffins, fruits and a 'frittata'--a quiche-like dish. Food enough for several days. She was available to answer any questions- yet gave us complete privacy.
We really savored this idyllic cottage where you can just rest, relax and experience the joys of nature."

Stayed a few nights","Lucy's place is bursting with charm and filled with hidden touches and artistic delights! I think we could have stayed a week and still found new treasures to see, hear, taste, and touch.
The cabin's location is perfect - overlooking and just steps away from Crystal Creek. We sat on the deck and watched a whole family of ducks fish and sunbathe on the rocks. We were also graced by Lucy's Blue Heron, who came to feed in the early morning hours, as well as after dinner. I only wish I had brought my watercolors - I would have loved to paint him!
Lucy made us feel like family - leaving delicious homemade goodies to welcome us. There are binoculars to birdwatch, wood for the firepit, s'more making supplies, games, books, and so much more! The pantry and cabinets are fully stocked with anything you might need to prepare a meal, and Kroger (surprisingly!) is only minutes away. The bed linens are the softest I have ever felt. My daughter even remarked on their luxury.
When we walked through the front door we felt magic, and that feeling stayed with us until we locked up and left. Featured in several books, magazines, and newspapers, Lucy's cabin MUST be experienced first hand."

Aside from the style the host made the stay incredible through her hospitality, from making sure the fridge and pantry was stocked with much more than the basics, to having muffins and a frittata ready prior to our stay. To top it all off the cabin is in a wonderful, quiet, and scenic neighborhood on the creek below while also being conveniently close to downtown Roanoke and the Blue Ridge Parkway as well."

The host, Lucy, was really great about responding quickly to pre-trip questions. The cabin is easy to find via GPS. Upon arrival we were blown away by the decor and all the fabulous food treats Lucy left. She even left me birthday balloons! The cabin is perfectly situated right next to the creek, and the sound of the flowing water added to the magical feel. It is well appointed, with plenty of towels, soap, blankets, etc. As gals that like to cook, let me tell you, this place is fully stocked with everything you might need to prepare meals. The beds were comfy, there is central heat and a wood burning fireplace, as well as a fire pit down near the creek. This place afforded us such a wonderful, comfortable and cozy spot to relax and catch up. Additionally, although you might feel like you are deep in the back woods, shopping and dining options are actually a short drive away. We had a great visit and would LOVE to come again!!"

Our host, Lucy, made a wonderful homemade breakfast for us with fresh fruit, a frittata and vegan chia pudding! It’s was more than enough for our two night stay. The master bed is comfortable and the sheets are luscious. The loft bed might be good for kids but is not comfortable for adults.
Our favorite part of the cabin is listening to the creek rushing by. Open the windows in the dining room and the bedroom to hear the creek inside, too.
The cabin is funky and fabulous and Lucy is a great host!"

She is the best host we have ever had at an air bnb. I would give her 50 stars if I could!
The little fire pit down by the water made our Halloween weekend even better than we expected. The beds were insanely comfortable, and the ambiance of the cabin is absolutely magical. We loved waking up and being able to hear the sound of the running water by the river. I have ZERO complaints! Thank you Lucy!!!"

The creek out back did not disappoint; we saw deer, ducks, and a river otter. There’s a porch you could sit on to enjoy the views or a short walk down a few steps to get to a secluded little spot with Adirondak chairs and a hammock. Lucy really made our stay special from homemade breakfast, to having the fire pit ready to go, to homemade soap in the bathroom. She offered everything you could need. Soft, clean towels, candles throughout. Was just a wonderful stay! Do be aware though if you get in late like we did, the driveway down to the cabin is steep and narrow. Navigate with care."

Stayed about a week","This little cabin is quite unique! We had a very relaxing week ""glamping"" here while visiting Roanoke. It is in a quiet location on a back road, but just a few minutes' drive to the grocery store and restaurants. Wifi is fine for teleworking, and we were able to stream a movie with no problem. The cabin was quite clean and well-equipped. The deck overlooking the creek is especially nice: we loved having wine and cheese dinners out there and watching the wildlife (deer, lots of ducks, turtles, a big heron). The main bedroom is quite comfortable as well. We were there during a heat wave, and the AC more or less kept up. The one caveat I will add is that the upstairs loft is much warmer than the rest of the house (which I expected, from the photos) and the mattress up there is saggy and uncomfortable (which I did not expect). So I can't say as I slept all that well. But apart from that, we really enjoyed our time in the magical cabin!"

From the tire swing that sits by the babbling creek, to nearby fire pit and Adirondack chairs, to the darling, well-appointed and super cozy interior of the soulful space, Lucy’s place is not to be missed. The other touches she lavishes upon her guests also make you feel very special - like homemade goodies and even champagne. My last night there, at Lucy’s suggestion I opened the window in the bedroom (which overlooks the creek). The night air, the soft sound of the water and the symphony of the woods, made the best night-time lullaby. I cannot wait to go back. Thank you again, Lucy. ♥️"

She left delicious treats for us including a delicious frittata for breakfast. The serene view of the rambling creek wad picture perfect! The host provided the softest sheets I've ever slept on...We couldn't have asked for anything more. We are already talking about when we can return!"

Stayed a few nights","Lucy’s cabin is straight out of a fairytale. Her home is absolutely beautiful with gorgeous love plants and the sweetest homey touches in ever single book and cranny. The bed was SO comfortable too - my husband and I left the window open at night (which, despite being there in the middle of February, didn’t make the room feel cold at all) so we could hear the creek while we fell asleep and waking up and it just added to the magic of the trip. And my favorite part is that Lucy left us DELICIOUS muffins, scones, and quiche! SO THOUGHTFUL! We also lit a fire every day/evening while we relaxed and read in the living room. I couldn’t have asked for a more perfect place to unplug for a long weekend. Lucy was fantastic and I can’t recommend her cozy cabin enough."

Lucy’s hospitality and generosity, along with expert area recommendations, allowed us to truly relax and enjoy all that the area had to offer.
Pro-tip - sleeping with the window open listening to the creek in the background is absolute nirvana.
Thanks again Lucy!"

Being located right next to a lake was so peaceful and tranquil you can hear the gushing of water throughout the cabin or sitting on the deck and it really made everything that much better. Lucy is an awesome host, she made us delicious muffins and a frittata and left other foods to snack on and left us information on things to do and places to go. Would not hesitate to come back!"

It was the perfect place to escape reality for a few days. It was a working getaway and the wifi easily kept up with teaching online classes. Afternoons were spent exploring Roanoke and the beauty outside the city. Lots of fabulous restaurants to chose from, though I ate several meals off the delicious quiche and muffins that Lucy left for me. The host is quick to respond to communication and very friendly and accommodating. I definitely hope to return!"

I knew there'd be big windows and nice light, etc, but I wasn't expecting such a sweeping view of downtown, nor to arrive in the middle of a small snowstorm! Corey was kind enough to allow me to check in a bit early, so by the time the snow really started to fall, I was already nestled in safe and sound with a mug of hot tea, watching the city turn white below. The apartment was spotless and tastefully furnished, and there were a number of thoughtful touches that made the stay extra special: bags of popcorn in the cabinet, a gift certificate to a local brewery, Netflix with its own airbnb account, and even mints on a fresh pile of folded towels. The location is perfectly walkable to all the downtown shops and spots to eat, and my husband joined me for a little date night. Thank you so much, Corey, we'll be back soon!"

The apt is SUPER well equipped with classy touches like make up removal wipes, coffee, teas, chocolate, extra chargers, etc. The massage chair was a blessing after a long day of hiking while taking advantage of the many streaming services. Corey was more than happy to provide hiking and restaurant recommendations, logistical clarifications and he saved the day (well night) when I cleverly locked myself out of the apt. The complex is a funky renovation of an older building which translates to a charming unit - giant windows with beautiful city views, classic wood floors and a little bit of noise - but only during the day. Overall, the place was spotless, comfortable and the location and free parking are convenient. I plan on coming back and plan to stay with Corey again. I highly recommend this Airbnb and this host."

The space is all handicap accessible, which is rare, but it meant there was a lot of room (felt bigger then the pictures). Building and apartment was quiet. Appreciated the box fan for circulating air at night and the space heaters for drying clothes after walking in the rain. Corey is extra communicative! Would stay again."

Corey could seriously lead a ""how-to"" course for AirBnb hosts...every detail is taken care of to ensure the place feels like home. Roanoke is the halfway point for a trip we make regularly and we'll continue to stay at Corey's places for as long as we make the same trip!! Highly recommended!"

Stayed a few nights","Corey is an amazing host. Thank you for responding, especially when we had to move our car around 2am. That was very scary. Glad we saw the sign and called you. Couldn't risk getting towed, especially from the assigned parking spot. That was a really strange moment, all turned out well. The home is beautiful, so much light, loved it. Coffee was delicious! Only downside, entry door has a super large gap underneath, windows are screwed shut so we weren't able to get any fresh air( wish we had know this, with covid still hanging around) And filter on the air handler looks like it's never been changed. All in all, would definitely recommend. It's in walking distance to pretty much everywhere downtown. We rented spin scooters, so much fun! Corey provided fans in the closet, AC was super cold, beautiful views. It's a great place to relax. Must see the Roanoke Star, beautiful! We went to visit family and found some time to explore downtown because of our fabulous location. We'll be back"

Older building that has been renovated to everything you could need including laundry on the same floor. Easy check-in and access to the building. Corey was incredibly proactive and accommodating when the usual parking spots were unavailable due to a mural being painted on the side of the building.
Fully stocked kitchen (coffee, coffee maker, waters in the fridge, utensils). Wifi worked great, comfortable space for multiple people. Streaming services available. Located downtown, easily walkable to shops, restaurants, and breweries.
All in all, absolutely no issues. Loved the space! Corey is a responsive and kind host. If I am ever in Roanoke, this is where I will stay again. Thanks, Corey!"

I especially loved walking outside and hearing the bells from a beautiful church across the street.

Stayed a few nights","Location: 100% Perfect location, we couldn't have found a better spot right in the middle of downtown. Excellent view, we loved watching the sunsets. We had zero issues finding a parking space. It's important to mention thought that the apartment is above a nightclub in an old building with thin walls and creaky floors. We could hear the music downstairs until 11 or 12:30 Thurs-Sat nights. We could also hear every conversation and every step the neighbors made. The HVAC unit was pretty loud too. So if you're looking for total silence, this is not the place!
Bed: Comfy king with plenty of pillows.
Amenities: Filtered water in the fridge was a bonus.
Bath: Low water pressure in the shower but the water got blazing hot super fast. Lotsa clean towels and plenty of toilet paper."

Stayed a few nights","I REALLY enjoyed my stay in this apartment. There are tons of windows and natural light, the decorations and amenities were comfy without being cluttered, and the whole place felt open and honestly bigger than I expected. The mattress was CLUTCH, probably the comfiest mattress I've slept on ever. Corey was super responsive and friendly and gave clear instructions for check-in and check-out, and I really appreciated the water bottles he left in the fridge. 12/10 experience."

Great views of the city, too. The sofa, I will say, is well passed it’s prime. It folds out into a futon, but I can’t imagine sleeping on it (sitting on it was uncomfortable enough, and it’s not like we were camped out sitting the whole time). Everything was clean and operable, though."

HE HAS THOUGHT OF EVERYTHING.
MUCH MORE AMENTITIES THAN HE LISTS.
THE PHOTOS ARE EXACTLY HOW IT LOOKS. THE VIEWS OF THE MOUNTAINS, CHURCHES AND HOTEL ROANOKE ARE AMAZING.
WE JUST MADE COFEE (DUNKIN DONUTS) THERE BUT YOU CAN COOK A FULL MEAL IF YOU DESIRE.
COREY IS THE MOST RESPONSIVE HOST THAT WE HAVE EVER DEALT WITH.
HE HELPED US CHECK IN WITHIN SECONDS.
YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY STAY HERE WHILE IN ROANOKE."

We stayed for a great price, it was extremely comfortable and cozy and we had plenty of room for our son and dog to run and play. The creek was wonderful to play in during the day and listen to by the fire at night! The cabin had everything we needed and we would definitely recommend it if you’re looking for some peace and quiet while being close to it all."

Stayed with a pet","The cabin is cute and in a good location with a large yard. The fence does need repaired and I had to use some bungee cords to hold it together so our dogs could run around. Unfortunately, the biggest issue was that the sheets were visibly dirty with hair (pet/human) and debris. This was true even for sheets that we found in the dryer, so it’s likely that a new w/d would be useful. Due to how dirty they were, we actually ended up leaving and driving the remaining 4 hours home. Otherwise this would have been a fantastic place."

My house is all electric so I am not used to the fumes. Just my personal preference. To end on a good note, the sky's are dark and nighttime views of the stars is very good. I would stay again.

The large, fenced yard is ideal for children or dogs and the deck is expansive and pleasant to enjoy the outdoors. The creek behind the cabin is a soothing plus, and although there is a road on the other side of the creek , it is well screened by trees and bushes and road noise is not bothersome. It’s an 8 minutes or so drive to a grocery store and restaurants. The hosts were quickly responsive to questions and helpful. An enjoyable stay."

It doesn't take but a few minutes to get to town and amenities but honestly the cabin was so cozy and the creek and deck so nice we barely wanted to leave anyways. My toddler absolutely loved having run of
the yard and we loved not having to keep such close tabs on him. We'll definitely be back if we can!"

Stayed with a pet","We absolutely loved this place. I wanted to spend my 30th birthday off the grid a little bit. I enjoyed that it was tucked away but still within 15-20 min of downtown. I brought my two medium/large dogs and they had a blast running through the backyard and it was super awesome they had dog bowls, treats, and toys for them to enjoy!! I wish there was more access to the creek behind the house but we still got to go put our feet in. The water pressure was not super strong but not a huge deal when everything else was AWESOME. I also love how tucked away from the main road it was letting us feel secluded. Definitely would recommend for anyone especially with dogs!"

Could not find the wifi information even after asking which was frustrating, and the main bedroom door did not latch and stayed slightly open, but I still used the streaming apps on the TV and had enough mobile data to get by. Overall I was pleased with the location and the accommodations and I would stay again"

We were so appreciative of the fenced in yard for our pet. This is very helpful when traveling with a pet. It gave us piece of mind knowing that our dog could run around a bit/play and go to the bathroom in a safe, enclosed, big yard. The creek behind the house is lovely and the sound of if running is so peaceful. My partner wants to stay here next time we go up to Blacksburg for a Tech game! Overall wonderful experience and would love to visit again!"

Stayed one night",be careful booking this place the owner might try to take advantage of you. i cleaned up the house before we left chatted to the bens cleaning lady and then left shortly after. once i got home i received a message from ben requested a refund for cleaning and things that were broken that we never even touched or noticed that was there. $200 for a door latch that we never saw or touched… yeah i don’t think so. the extra cleaning they wanted to charge me for was bc after i straightened up the house and put all the trash beside the washer they went and through board games around and our trying to blame us. honestly had a good time at the cabin but didn’t expected to get scammed the next day so it really makes it an overall bummer!

Stayed with a pet","This property was extremely dog friendly, with a fully fenced yard, dog food and water bowls, and a box of dog toys. Location is very close to Tanglewood Mall and many restaurants, grocery stores, and other retail; however, its location off the beaten path feels very private, despite being so close to shopping and Rte 581. There are also several good, moderate hikes in the Blue Ridge mountains within easy driving distance. The cabin is well appointed, particularly the outdoor spaces. A huge outdoor deck includes a gas fire pit, lots of comfortable seating, a large shade umbrella, an outdoor dining table, and a large gas grill. The yard includes a wood fire pit. While this cabin feels private and worked well for us, note that there is a freight rail line very close by and a road directly behind the property that is pretty busy. It didn't really bother us, but to be clear to any other renters, you're not going to be in a quiet natural spot. Overall, great value and experience."

This is a great place. It's so close to many Roanoke businesses and restaurants, but it's a quiet place right on the river.
Cons:
One bedroom door doesn't stay closed (there is no latch plate) and there is no door on one bathroom.
The rate for 18 hours (4 pm to 10 am) is expensive. Many places have check in earlier than 3 pm and check out 11 am or later."

Stayed with kids","We enjoyed staying at the cabin M-Saturday during our vacation. The cabin was homey and comfortable and having a kitchen and laundry on site was really helpful while traveling with children. The location was quiet and we felt very secluded during our stay which was really nice.
My only feedback is that it would be great to install grab bars by the toilet for wheelchair users or those with mobility aides or physical disabilities to safely use the toilet. Also, the shower stall is unfortunately, not a roll-in shower and wasn't wide enough to accommodate a standard wheelchair width. My husband was able to use it with my help if I propped up his back wheel on the lip and helped him get in, but it would not be possible for him to use this independently in his chair without help and without sticking out a bit. It would be great to swap out the stall for a wider one or one without a lip entirely so a wheelchair user could wheel in independently."

Stayed with a pet","The cabin overall was cute and the hosts answer pretty quickly and have extra amenities like towels and such which is nice, but the fact that the cabin is listed under dog friendly with a fully enclosed yard is not accurate. The fence is mostly enclosed with a gap between the side of the cabin and where the fence ends that was big enough for my 50 lb medium sized dog to fit through and escape when we let her out to pee. Thank god we found her but we weren’t able to let her outside again without a leash for the rest of the trip out of the fear it would happen again. The hole is to the right of the door (if looking from outside) where the fence meets the cabin. The roof also unfortunately leaked onto my husband’s head while we slept (in the bedroom next to the living room on the right side of the bed). Otherwise the location is nice and quiet with a great view of the stars and a creek and is only 15-20 mins from downtown spots for food. Please be wary if bringing pets."

Stayed with a pet","Roanoke was experiencing colder than normal temps- most of Roanoke was out of power and although we had power (which we were so grateful) we also had some frozen pipes. Ben sent over water and called a plumber immediately. We appreciate this kindness so much and feel like he went above and beyond even during the Holidays! My sister and I loved how beautiful and homey this was along with being so pet friendly for my Lab and her pug. I loved sitting by the water and reading (the rest of the week was beautiful- especially being from NY). The fence is priceless, the beds were so comfy and despite the short time we didn’t have water (nothing you can do about it!) everything was perfect. My sister worked from the cabin and had no trouble with the internet, there were plenty of snacks and even beautiful dishes and pans. When our parents came over to visit we even played games together.Thank you so much for having this place for when we bring our dogs and are visiting family in Roanoke!"

The location is perfect for you if you’re doing anything in the downtown area where you’ll also find fun shops and great restaurants and bars. The loft was spacious, comfy and very clean. Jason has clearly earned his super host status! His communication is excellent, responding quickly and clearly. When one of his other units became booked while I was messaging with questions, he let me know about this loft which was just coming available. Parking is not a problem as Center in the Square Garage (very reasonably price) is just down the street. We were very pleased with this rental choice and you will be, too!"

Stayed a few nights","Cute and well appointed house. It is a renovated older home. It is very clean and well stocked. Had plenty of kitchen utensils for cooking at home.
We stayed to attend graduation at Virginia Tech. My older parents do not enjoy eating out due to health concerns so it was important to us to have a place to cook. This house is comfortable and is located in a quiet neighborhood.
We really enjoyed having the river trial nearby. We went there often to walk and run. There is also a playground and basketball court nearby.
I appreciated the host checking if we needed anything and being proactive at communicating.
I would stay again. Thank you for making our stay wonderful."

Group trip","We were looking for a house near Elmwood Park and this house was an easy nine minute drive. It made a perfect home-base while we were in town.
We found the space comfortable and extremely clean. The dining room table made the perfect spot to play cards. We made several meals at home and found the kitchen to be well supplied. One thing we really appreciated were the nightlights throughout the space and clocks by the beds. Both bedrooms and the living room had televisions, so everyone was happy! The low couch could be an issue for someone with leg issues, but there's a good armchair in the living room. The wifi was fast. Anna was a responsive hostess."

Stayed with a pet","Great location for our weekend in Roanoke to see a performance at Roanoke Ballet Theatre! The dance studios in Grandin Village are a very short drive (walkable, but we were a little nervous about walking home in the dark with no sidewalk and cars zooming over the hill near the house). The park across the street was a great place to let our dog run and chase balls.
We appreciate all the thoughtful touches - snacks for us AND our dog, a big box of dog toys, blackout curtains in the bedroom, comfy furniture. Plenty of room to put our dog’s crate in either the living room or dining room.
The spacious kitchen is well-equipped, although with so many great places to eat nearby, we barely used it. Bathroom was so stocked with necessities that I barely unpacked my toiletries bag…very nice shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, hand soap. Plenty of towels, and great lighting!
Anna was very communicative with check-in instructions and immediately responsive to any questions we had.
We’ll be back!"

There was nothing to fear at Emma and Anna's place, though! Everything was superb. The beds are nice, the kitchen had every utensil we looked for (we didn't do any cooking but you know that panic that there won't be coffee), and the space was great for our dog when we were out during the day. Lounging on the couch at the end of the long day was incredible. Shower has greta pressure and plenty of hot water, and the AC worked super well. Lastly the blackout curtains were amazing for sleep quality. Thanks yall, we really liked your place."

Anna's home was very comfortable and conveniently located within walking distance of the Roanoke Valley Greenway and Historic Grandin Village and Wassena neighborhood restaurants and shops. Downtown restaurants, shops and attractions were a short car ride and even moderately challenging hikes were only 20 minutes away. We highly recommend Anna's home to anyone visiting Roanoke."

The neighborhood is interesting. It’s perfectly safe although not very “pretty”. It’s a great location that’s close to the Grandin Village neighborhood. We walked though it’s a 2 minute drive. Downtown is literally a 5-minute car ride. I looked at lots of places before booking but I’m glad I chose this one."

Stayed a few nights","Anna & Emma are such terrific hosts! We were SO happy with our stay at their home and their thoughtful communication and little touches made it that much better. The house was so cozy and clean, had more than enough room, includes laundry, 3 flatscreen TVs each with streaming, comfortable beds, and I especially loved the shampoo, conditioner and body wash dispensers mounted on the shower wall - that body wash is especially amazing - my boyfriend agrees! The location of the house is IDEAL - there are neighbors nearby but they are not right against you, the neighborhood itself is super safe and within walking distance to markets, restaurants and the “hippie” district which was right up our alley. We stayed there during Thanksgiving week so the weather was pretty cold, and when we arrived at the house the heater was already turned on which was such a thoughtful (and much appreciated) touch. There was also coffee, sweet treats, and all the basics we needed in the well-stocked kitchen. We didn’t bring our dog on this trip, but he would have loved it there, and we noticed all the doggie treats & toys that were available for those that bring their canine companion. Check in & check out was super easy and on our own time which was great, and I knew that if we needed anything at all, we could send a message to our hosts and they would respond right away. I could not recommend Anna, Emma and the Biking Dog House more! We have family close by so we will definitely be staying there again!"

Stayed one night","My wife and I were doing an overnight in Roanoke on our way home from Maryland to Nashville. We have two small poodles. This place was clean and insanely convenient with a great location and good food not far away! We had a VERY nice dinner at Local Roots nearby and then breakfast at the Scratch Biscuits. It was the perfect stopover for us and when we make the trek again, we’ll definitely be back!"

Stayed a few nights","We had a great stay at The Biking Dog House. It was spacious, extremely clean, and well provisioned. We had everything - and more - than we needed for our comfortable stay. The hosts were very thoughtful in setting up the house, which is geared towards people who love to bike and love their dogs. Our hosts were great communicators too, checking in with us daily to see if we needed anything. I highly recommend a stay at The Biking Dog House the next time you want to visit Roanoke!"

Stayed one night","This Airbnb is the cutest home in Roanoke! My friend, her dog, and I arrived late at night and checking in was so easy. It’s an adorable, spacious free standing home in a beautiful naturey area. We loved how dog friendly it was. Perfect overnight stay. Thank you so much!"

Stayed one night","Anna's place worked fine for us for a quick night's stay – it's not a destination stop but a straightforward, clean place to spend the night. We found it slightly odd that there's a camera out front and specific instructions in the house manual not to obstruct its view, but if that doesn't bother you it's a safe bet."
