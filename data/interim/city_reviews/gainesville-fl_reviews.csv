Stayed over a week","The shipping container tiny house was the perfect option for my long-term medical assignment. Very convenient location, has easy parking, and a very safe location at all hours of the day or night. Location is very close to the medical centers and local shopping. I am planning to stay in the shipping container tiny house for my next assignment of 36 days. Easy individual access and peaceful location."

Stayed a few nights","The tiny container was pristine and perfectly comfortable for my husband and my short trip to Gainesville. Vanessa’s instructions for self check-in were very clear and intuitive and made finding the space a breeze. The inside is super cozy and squeaky clean, and the bed was also very comfy!
We didn’t have any face-to-face time with the host, which I honestly prefer. But Vanessa was on top of communication with us and available for anything we may have needed from her. Staying here enhanced our weekend and I couldn’t recommend it any more!"

Stayed a few nights","Loved the stay! Vanessa described the place clearly and the instructions were helpful, the only thing i WOULD say if i had to say anything is that prior to the instructions of check-in at booking i was not aware this was behind someone’s home but that could have been my own misconception! I didn’t really find it to be any issue of privacy tho, as it is gated in it’s own little area. Very clean and smelled brand new inside, people who live in the home were very nice as well.
Full five stars from us :)"

Vanessa communicates every thing you need to know beforehand. And, being in Gainesville (UofF), the location is just one turn off a main road, and then literally only 4 min from Main and University restaurants and music. I have absolutely nothing to complain about here!"

Stayed a few nights",I stayed here while visiting Gainesville for the first time and looking at UF. Vanessa’s place was lovely. From the second I walked in the door I felt safe and secure. It was extremely quiet and everything locks up. There were curtains that blocked every window if you’re someone who enjoys absolute privacy. Not to mention the bnb was fenced in it’s own private yard with a gate that also locks. I really enjoyed my stay and will definitely choose to stay here again next time I’m in Gainesville.

The communication and instructions prior to arrival were perfect.
Once we arrived, the unit was set to a perfect temperature and calm music was playing to set the mood. The unit was small, which we were expecting. However, everything was laid out so thoughtfully that it actually felt bigger than it was, and was comfortable for two people.
Thank you Vanessa and family for being such great hosts and for such a cool experience!"

But Vanessa made sure I knew what I was getting into before I even booked-so I LOVED it! The little touches in the space and with the write ups after confirmation were perfect. Book it. And enjoy!"

Stayed one night","Me and my husband were looking for a place for one night because we were visiting Gainesville for our friend’s graduation. We wanted something unique and were really happy when we found Vanessa’s place! This container provides everything you need - from cozy bed to hot coffee in the morning. I really liked the Swedish style of the place. Despite the small space, you will be able to find the place for all your clothes, shoes or other items. The backyard is great, especially in the morning - it feels like you’re in the forest, close to nature. I would definitely recommend this place and we would be really glad to stay there when we’ll have a chance"

Stayed over a week","Had the real pleasure of staying here for an extended working trip. The container studio is open, airy and spotless, so it's super-easy to get comfy and relax. Also thoughtfully furnished and appointed with a well-equipped kitchen featuring a not-so-mini fridge and a surprising amount of counter and table space. Then there's the roomy, plush and supportive queen and the deep-seat sofa you can just chill on forever. And the container's stationed on an adorable, perfectly private compound in the hosts' yard, yet completely fenced off and separate from it, and adjacent to a pretty wooded lot that has a knack for attracting a bumble bees and cool forest butterflies like red-spotted purples. Makes for really wonderful mornings sippin something you brewed in the nespresso. Ample opportunities to partake in greener practices are a seamless part of the container's design and the compound, too. And Vanessa and John are great. Responsive, friendly, and sent tips on what was fun to do in in the neighborhood (which is walking distance to historic sites like the Thomas Center and biking distance to downtown and UF) when I was there, but hung back and let me do my own thing. I prefer auto-pilot stays, so that's a plus for me. Almost didn't want to check out."

The upgrades and decor provide a very inviting energy and you immediately feel right at home. Small touches and provisions added an intimate touch to the space. It feels like someone takes great care of this cottage. Very easy to find, easy checkin with lockbox, and clear checkout instructions. Would definitely stay again and highly recommend.

Clean, charming, well furnished, and equipped with toys, toddler utensils, child locks, and other amenities that are very useful for little ones. Our 16 month old loved finding fun surprises all over the house, from the air conditioned Florida room with a view of the twinkling porch lights and garden, to the variety of toys in both closets. I hope this house is available again next time we’re in town!"

Due to the circumstances around our visit, we weren’t sure of how long our stay would be so we had to take it day by day. Mel was so understanding and accommodating. She was able to accommodate our scheduling and short notice extensions of our stay. She made the housing part of our stay very easy and smooth.
The house itself was very comfortable and decorated beautifully. The beds and furniture was very comfortable and the desk made the unexpected need to work remotely a lot easier.
Definitely a great stay, and compared to the other homes listed in the area, I think she’s priced very fairly. A lot of other homes in this area seemed to be over priced for not as nice conditions."

The yard was great, nice yard with tables and chairs for coffee and pastries from nearby Curia or Afternoon. We loved the small touches like the kid toys the closet (our kid loved the mini basketball hoop), the container of stuff in case you forgot toiletries (we didn't need it, but it was nice to see as an option if we did), and the body wash / shampoo in the shower (so many places don't have soap, which blows my mind).
In short, Melimeli went above-and-beyond with her space and we appreciated it. We'd definitely stay again next time we want to explore the area."

I would definitely stay here again! Very clean! Located right on the corner lot, which makes it easy to find (we did not hear any traffic). Still in plenty of nature and peaceful spot!

The neighborhood is quiet and could occasionally hear the upstairs neighbor’s footsteps/voices during the day but it was minimal and was quiet from 10pm until the next morning that it was never a bother to us. The place was so comfy we felt right at home when we walked in. We truly appreciate Christian’s quick responses and hospitality during our stay. We highly recommend staying here!"

We were able to visit Paynes Prairie, Micanopy, local museums, antique shops, etc. but still enjoy the convenience of having restaurants and shopping nearby once back here. Plus, it was the perfect place to rest after a long day of hiking!"

There's a private patio with table and chairs to sit outside. Inside the place was well appointed stylish and super clean. There's no living/sitting area - but we didn't miss it as we were busy all day and evening. There's a big grocery store 5-minutes walk away.

We were looking for a quiet getaway as we had been travelling for three weeks prior and Johnathons place checked all the boxes.
It has a little patio set on the entrance deck and we had our supper and lunch.

Stayed a few nights","Our stay in Ryland's studio worked out well for us. We were in Gainesville for an appointment at the University of Florida and Ryland's place was close enough to the university so that access to the early-morning appointment was quick and easy. While close to the university, the studio avoids the hustle and bustle of the campus as it is located in a quiet neighborhood and had onsite parking (always a plus!). Ryland was very responsive to our questions and needs, and we appreciated his recommendations for places to eat and sightsee - great to have a local's viewpoint. The studio itself was clean, well-designed and comfortable. We will be happy to return there in the future."

Everything was clean, orderly, and better than expected. Great privacy with a pretty back yard. Our only recommendation would be to bring a mattress topper if you are a sensitive sleeper like us.
LOVED OUR STAY!!!"

He spared no expense.
Morning coffee on the patio was heaven. He had everything one could want to make the perfect cup. Even the cups were perfect. Again, Ryland spared no expense.

Stayed a few nights","things, the campus is gorgeous: Situated just a few blocks from the UF, Gainesville, this lovely home away from home serves as a perfect landing pad for a short or lengthy visit to this proud college town!
Situated within a quiet and established neighborhood just off the beaten path of University Avenue, this cozy apartment is within walking distance of plush campus green spaces and bubbling brooks. Safe pedestrian walkways lead to a wide range of coffee shops and local restaurants of all varieties.
Ryland, our gracious host (who also had a hand in its construction), provides clear instructions for check-in and departure. The unit is a modern and stylish efficiency; immaculately clean. He even provides coffee and, better still, chocolate! Ha!
As a single mother, traveling alone with my daughter, it was very reassuring to know that Ryland and his family were accessible and kind. I am so grateful! Thanks, Ryland!

Stayed one night","This little slice of heaven was not my first choice for quick after holiday staycation but when the 1st host didn’t respond in time I decided to book. I’m a firm believer in everything happens for a reason because Ryland and his space were absolutely perfect. I read the overview so I expected short showers BUT the water stays hot way longer than expected! Everything was super clean, the bed was extremely comfortable and the charging port w/ multiple chargers was a nice touch! They provided us quick assistance w/ check in and a detailed list of restaurants nearby. I forgot my vape pen and he even mailed it back! Stop looking just go ahead and book already!!"

Stayed a few nights","I attended a conference at UF, the conference hotel was asking more than $320 a night for a three night stay, so I scoured AirBNB and found this gem. It is quite new, every interior surface is immaculate and modern. It is cozy, but much more generous than a hotel room. There is a private, small deck area (it was 98 degrees and 100% humidity during my trip, so I merely admired it from the comfort of the air conditioned studio apartment). It was exactly as described, the host was very proactive with communications, and I was even able to make excellent coffee in-room using the provided French press and accoutrements. I asked about and was given a roster of dining options, too. During my stay, I could not hear any outside noise at all, it is located in a fairly quiet residential neighborhood. I had a perfect stay and would re-book in a heartbeat should I return to Gainesville. Thank you, Ryland!"

Stayed one night","Checker's place was clean and well-supplied with amenities. The location was easy to find, and the neighborhood was quiet. My only issue was communicating with Checker during check-in. The door code for the room was not provided with the check-in info, and the hosts said they would greet me when I arrived and give me the code then. I messaged them through the AirBnb app ten minutes before arriving, and I saw that my message was read by Checker. When I arrived, however, nobody was there. I sent another message and waited. After a few minutes, I texted the number that was provided by the host (which specified texting rather than calling). No response. I then called the number and left a message. Finally, a few minutes later, Checker came out to greet me, barely even offering an apology for making me wait outside for 20 minutes. If the hosts insist on providing the door code in person (instead of just sending it ahead of time), communication needs to be better to avoid these situations."

Stayed a few nights",I stayed at Checker's Garden Room and it was great! They were super attentive. Any questions I had they would respond right away. The room looked exactly as it did in the pictures. Very cute and full of little touches to make you feel welcome and comfortable. I was visiting my son who goes to UF. The Garden Room is very central to everything. About 15-20 minutes from everything. I would definitely recommend it if you are ever in Gainesville!

Stayed a few nights","This place is perfect! The room is cozy but not too small and has everything we needed. He even stocked the fridge with soda and water!
I use Airbnb a lot, and Checker has something in this room that is REALLY hard to find - an actual freezer in the fridge! It’s apartment-sized so keep that in mind, but it’s not just a tiny frozen shelf inside the fridge compartment. It’s got a separate door and there is definitely enough room for a few days worth of meals.
Then there’s the outside - the garden in the back is absolutely lovely and lush. I worked there and I loved it as my office!
Lastly, Checker himself is a great guy - a wonderful soul who was warm, welcoming, and helpful.
We’ll be back!! Thanks Checker!"

Stayed a few nights","One of the best AirBnbs in Gainesville. I stayed a week and would have happily stayed longer. Cannot be beat for the location - close to everything - cleanliness, friendliness, and quiet. The bed was comfortable and I loved having a fridge in my room so I could store my food without feeling like I was taking up room in the kitchen fridge. There was a huge amount of closet storage too, which helped me as I have a lot of stuff for long term stays. I had the whole half of the house to myself including my own bathroom (just outside the room in the hallway, but still around the corner/ hidden from view of the rest of the house) and this made me very comfortable. As a single woman, staying here not only met my standards but Cassia made me feel at home and welcome. Would definitely stay again."

Otherwise, the space was clean and quiet and private. I typically prefer areas with separate entrances (I work nights, so it makes life easier for everyone) but the house was large enough, and the suite separate enough, that I was comfortable with the location.
I really appreciated the extra touches - including snacks, coffee and mini fridge! - of the space. Bed was comfortable. Place was perfectly clean.
Thank you!"

You’ll want to bring your own coffee/tea and any creamer additives for those drinks. The view outside is private and peaceful."

Stayed a few nights","Wow, unique stay, great location, amazing value and comfort!
I stayed here for a couple nights with my husband as we were visiting friends around Gainesville and Alachua, and it's a perfect cozy getaway for a single person or a happy couple.
I was a tiny bit skeptical about a shipping container but for the money that weekend, I couldn't beat it and interestingly, it's even better in person than in the pictures! It is SUPER comfortable, SPOTLESS and feels spacious... the bed was better than many hotels, and the shower water pressure and temperature were perfect.
They packed everything you'd need for a short stay into a small but perfectly organized place. We didn't need to cook but there is enough there to make small and basic meals for sure.
The property itself is very private and super quiet, great if you like to sit outside and meditate in nature (we do). Close to a ton of stuff in downtown Gainesville!
Better than ANY hotel in the area at this price! Would absolutely re-book."

Stayed a few nights","This was a fun stay! We enjoyed the concept of the ""tiny house"" and it was just what we were looking for to enjoy the weekend. Troy's directions in light of the phone insisting we go a different direction were perfect. Wished we had time to enjoy the firepit- maybe next time!"

Stayed a few nights","Very unique, cozy little space! Comes as advertised, very clean, modern and gets the job done. The space is quite small, that would be my only drawkback...suitcase was just in the middle of the floor as I couldn't really find another space for it. However, for a short 2 night stay, this place was absolutely fine. Really pleasant waking up to the greenery outside the glass wall. Would recommend"

Stayed a few nights","Great for short stays or new experiences! The container itself is clean and equipped with amenities. There were a few bugs but it is normal due to its nature/location but did not bother us. WARNING: the area at night can be noisy since it is near downtown (music blaring, etc.) if you are a light sleeper and cannot stand noises this place is not for you. The surrounding areas may feel a bit unsafe, please be careful (especially at night). Other than that the location is all the way in a secluded dead-end area, very private. The fireplace was lovely after walking downtown. Thank you Leandro!"

Stayed one night","I came up from south Florida to visit a few of the springs they have in the area. I wanted a nicely placed place that wasn’t to big as i wouldn’t spend to much time there. Troy’s listing was perfect for what we needed. The place looks exactly like the pictures and was very clean, it has everything you need. Troy and his team are very responsive and helpful. The college town of UF is also about 5 minutes away so there are PLENTY places to pass time or find food. I HIGHLY recommend troys listing!"

Stayed a few nights","I had a pleasant stay at this nice and affordable space conveniently located near the downtown area. When searching for the location, using car directions on G-maps will definitely assist you (When using the walk directions, it took me down an adjacent road that didn't have a clear pathway to the Airbnb). The unit is located on a small dirt road that passes by 2 small houses. The shipping container was a neat experience and it provided all the essentials necessary for a comfortable stay.
One thing to note is that walking around at night might be a bit intimidating due to the condition of some nearby houses needing some care. However, despite this, I didn't encounter any problems during my stay and would certainly consider booking this place again in the future."

The host did respond and apologize but I had to cancel meetings the next day since I only got 2 hours of sleep.

Stayed one night","COOL unit. Easy access and close to UF/town. Clean and perfect for a short stay. Pay attention to Troy's helpful hints, like close the door so to prevent mosquitoes coming in. Troy leaves some nice little essentials such as sunscreen and insect repellant, sugar, salt and pepper, but there is nothing like coffee. There is a sketch house next door and a trailer in the lot that is a little off putting, but I am a 6 foot male and was unconcerned. Overall the value is there for cost, cleanliness and proximity to UF. They do allow dogs, and this would be a GREAT spot for a dog owner as there was some runaround room for a dog. I would stay here again, especially if I were going to football game and tailgating, as you could probably have a nice little tailgate in the unit lot first before going to game."

The bed was comfortable and we loved being able to look out of the big window into the woods behind us. We were provided with everything we needed- including bug spray and sunscreen which was very nice. There were also citronella candles outside if we wanted to hang out in front. Being a Florida native who grew up in the woods, I'm used to the critters, so if you're not from here definitely heed Troy's warning! We felt right at home and had no problems finding the location. We were close to town and all it took was a 5-6 minute car ride to get to where we wanted to go. I highly recommend this spot for those who enjoy the outdoors as it feels very immersive."

The often ingenious use of space is complimented by the upscale-industrial design is well suited to steel containers.
I particularly appreciated & loved that they did not shy away from adding the comfy necessities of life today, minimal well-appointed kitchen & bathroom , nice towels, a huge flat screen where you can Netflix & Chill from the equally comfy bed or couch. Plenty of outlets and surface space that can easily be moved to suit your needs. It’s a fun and unique space that
I highly recommend!, & look forward to future stays and workshops."

Stayed a few nights","This house is amazing. You feel like you are in Miami, but it is Gainesville Florida. The toilets are a whole new experience...one of the best features. The furnishings, yummy blankets, games, pool, spa-like bathrooms, and overall aesthetic is INSTA WORTHY!! The pool is nice and heated, and the outdoor firepit made it nice on those cool spring/fall Florida nights. I have stayed here twice, and I will stay anytime I am in the area. They think of everything, coffee, hot cocoa, fish food for the koi fish, games, cozy blankets, laundry, and high level entertainment options. I would not stay anywhere else when I am in this area...only thing missing is a hot tub!!"

Slippers robes were provided, which I thought was a great touch. There is a scent being put through the AC ducks which took some getting used to. I would only suggest take better care of the exterior pool areas. Close to Gainesville airport which was great. Dropping family members off.

Group trip","This is a beautiful home in a really quiet, nice family neighborhood. It is very convenient to UF (my Gator rode his bike to the house to meet us) and also 2-3 blocks from a Publix & Fresh Market which was great for quick errands. The beds were very comfortable and all bedding freshly laundered. The back yard and deck were a great gathering place for the beautiful Florida November nights and the fire pit kept us warm! My family (husband and I, two college sons, and both sets of grandparents, and our dog!) spent thanksgiving there (in town for UF/FSU game) and the house was beautifully decorated for a great fall celebration. Thanks again! The host was VERY responsive any time I had questions with an open text thread during our stay. Great place for an upscale stay in Gainesville!"

Group trip","The house was absolutely beautiful. It was also well stocked with almost everything you could need on vacation. I would recommend this place. However be sure to inquire about all of the rules and expectations prior to purchase.
The host LaTisha was very responsive.
However we had a few issues during our stay and some of those issues were not resolved. We were also immediately blamed for the issues. I have a great reputation with Airbnb. I reported everything to her as soon issues occurred. The AC/fans in both small bedrooms did not work this was not resolved during our stay. The master bathroom toilet started leaking into the bedroom I immediately cleaned it up so the property was not damaged and promptly and respectfully contacted LaTisha. She sent out a plumber. Then later text me informing me that wipes were found in the pipes. I personally stayed in this room and used this bathroom and only used the toilet paper provided by the Airbnb. After explaining this I was informed a claim would be filed through Airbnb and airbnb could handle it. Which did not seem fair or understanding to me when I am certain that wipes were not used during our stay. Her personal staff informed me and my guests that the plumbing system was old and often backed up. We then encountered a huge amount of maggots after only being there 1 night. We had a small amount of trash placed in the appropriate trash cans (not full and only there for a short time). Maggots swarmed the back patio and patio doors. LaTisha did send someone to resolve this issue. However, long after the issue was resolved her staff continued to hang around the house making the guests uncomfortable. She did not leave until almost 10pm and she initially arrived at 3.
We paid a $250 cleaning fee but we’re asked to throughly clean everything or told we would be charged extra from a website hidden from Airbnb. All these rules and hidden charges were not disclosed until after purchase of the Airbnb.
Outside of these issues the place was immaculate. Again Latisha was very responsive at all hours and for the most part very helpful."

Stayed one night","What a lovely person she is. She even prepares breakfast for the guests. The first for me in the many air bnb’s I have stayed in. Delicious coffee, very good and fresh bread with cheeses. Fruit that tasted from the farmer’s market. Blueberry muffins. And a beautiful view of her patio full of tropical plants while enjoying your breakfast.
Room was big, clean and very quiet. Bathroom two steps away.
Highly recommend this Airbnb."

Our sleep was peaceful, quiet and had zero disturbance from external sources.

Just don’t blink while looking for the sign where to turn onto the drive listed as her street. It’s almost a hidden drive but well worth being careful to find! It’s by a sign “Hobits”."

Although the bathroom is not en suite, it is right across the hall from the bedroom door - and separate from the rest of the house making the entire guest area very private and quiet. Ilona offers a small breakfast (coffee, toast, cheese, jam and fruit) which was an unexpected plus, not to mention a lovely way to start the day. Furthermore, the location is quiet, secure, and convenient to almost anything you could need. Overall, I recommend staying at Ilona’s place without hesitation."

I ate a light yet delicious breakfast offered by the host, who must I say were so welcoming, considerate, and even encouraging after learning the work I do. I was able to work in their space within the privacy of the green space outside. The bed felt amazing and pillows were soft and fluffy. The shower water was great; I love hot showers.

Stayed a few nights",We liked this five star AirBnB and both Hosts so much we came back for a second stay! Our second stay was just as great as the first. Our Hosts were very helpful with everything we needed during our stay. They went above and beyond our expectations to make sure we were comfortable. Breakfast was delicious each morning. They are both interesting to talk to with a great sense of humor. Their TV with Netflix and HBO Max was great for binge watching. The large window in the bedroom lets in a lot of sunlight and the window blind makes the room dark at night the way we like it. Their bed is super comfortable in the large bedroom. Their neighborhood is quiet during the day and night. Safe neighborhood to walk in during the day with many stores and restaurants. We highly recommend the Adam’s Rib Company Restaurant up the street. Their brisket is the best! Our Hostess made delicious fried zucchini and shared it. I highly recommend this very clean AirBnB. Thank you both for another great stay!

The bedroom was large with a very comfortable bed and lots of sunlight. The two closets were spacious. The bedroom and bathroom were very clean with soft towels. The shower was hot. The breakfast each morning was delicious and I really appreciate it being ready when I woke up from over sleeping. I hope Ilona will forgive me for getting her up that early! It was nice to talk to her and her husband in the kitchen and have some laughs. I enjoyed tasting her husband’s delicious baked dessert that made the house smell like yellow cake mix! I walked the neighborhood & stores several times in the daytime and it was clean and safe. Lots of restaurants. I highly recommend this AirBnB with this very kind, down to earth couple.

Stayed one night",Ilona's place is tucked away in a little community at the top of a hill. Her husband checked me in as Ilona was out of town. I had asked for a secure and safe place to store my bicycle overnight and they provided space in the garage for me. The bedroom is right off the garage with the bathroom across the hall. Everything was super-clean. The bed was comfortable for naps as well as overnight. I did not take advantage of the continental breakfast Ilona offered. I was out cycling at 7am to avoid the hotter part of the day. The house was quiet and peaceful. All I needed was a bed and a shower for a weekend of cycling in Gainesville. Ilona's house exceeded my needs and gave me my night away from home. I would certainly stay there again.
