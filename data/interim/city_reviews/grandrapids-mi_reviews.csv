Stayed a few nights","A great place for the more free spirit artistically inclined individual. A short bus ride from downtown Grand Rapids. Within walking distance of local restaurants, markets, even a dispensary if you swing that way. Just a couple blocks from Frosty Boy, a great ice cream stand.
It is smoking friendly, but an air purifier can be supplied. A fully kitted kitchen is wonderful for those who love to cook. A dedicated space just for art helps add a wonderful personality. the projector in the living room is a wonderful way to enjoy some Netflix or Spotify without your phone screen.
Jacob the host is a great guy. Making sure everything is going good without being too intrusive. Snacks and a coffee machine in the bedroom is such a nice little touch. The bathrooms are stocked with the basics and kept nice and tidy.
All that and it being more affordable for similar places makes The Space Cave an excellent stay."

Stayed one night","Jacob's house totally matches the description. The area is very close to downtown, quite nice for walking. Check-in is easy and flexible. The place is well equipped to have a good stay. Although Jacob is quite clear with cigarette consumption, the smell can be strong for those who are not used to it. Overall it was a good place to spend time in Grand Rapids"

There were ample art supplies around, and made a couple masterpieces; which is awesome to see the works that other guests have made up on the walls.
Definitely looking to head back and spend some more time exploring Grand Rapids!"

Stayed one night","Last minute decided to go to Michigan for NYE for a concert and didn’t want to stay at some janky hotel for basically the same price so we decided to give this a try. And my boyfriend and I were so glad we stayed here. We have never stayed at a place like this, we usually have a hotel room or just rent out a whole house for ourselves, Only time I ever ran into other guests was during check out, which we both liked since we like our privacy. Everything was accurate from the listing, everything had a place. Whole house was clean, there were some delicious cookies Jacob left out which I definitely appreciated. Room was perfect for the night. The big selling point on booking this was that it was 420 friendly and that we were able to smoke comfortably, and didn’t have to go to the car and such. The location was perfect as it was only 10 ish minutes away from the music venue, which was super convenient. We honestly enjoyed it so much, I’m sure we’ll be booking again in the future!"

He explains it better than me but I think it's pretty cool you can smoke inside the house. His house cleaner cleans family I think. She does a really good job and keeps on top of everything.

Stayed a few nights","I struggled with this review. It’s an expectation issue. If you don’t plan on spending a lot of time in the house and just need a place to crash, it’s warm and comfortable. You’ll enjoy your stay. If you plan on spending a lot of time in the house, there going to be other people in the main areas and the rooms are on the smaller side. So adjust your expectations. Jacob is awesome and responsive. If you’re in town to have a good time in Grand Rapids it’s a great spot."

Kitchen was fully stocked with spices and gadgets, plus the backyard was nice and private. The AC worked great in the room. There's coffee in the rooms for the morning or whenever, and there was a side table with extra plugs that worked with my playstation! It was quiet and peaceful and I would definitely have to stay there again."

Restaurants, grocery stores, shopping, bars, CVS, all within 5-15 minutes away. The neighborhood is gorgeous and filled with historical homes. I would often walk around just to admire them.
The hosts (Jill and Tim) were amazing. They were so kind, helpful, and respectful of privacy. Clearly they have done some traveling themselves because the Airbnb has a handful of really cool maps!
This open concept studio is a great spot to stay in the GR area, especially if you're traveling alone. Clean, great AC, well stocked, and spacious. This spot is LGBTQ+ friendly, which is always a comfort to me when traveling.
Thank you, Jill and Tim!"

Jill and Tim's space is very clean and they've included lots of thoughtful touches - yogurt, oats and granola for breakfast, coffee in the freezer, stacks of books and board games, and even a little Zen garden by the window. Tim came down on our first day and gave us some great recommendations for food and drinks in the neighborhood. We tried Elk Brewing on his recommendation and were not disappointed! Overall this was an outstanding place to stay for our long weekend in Grand Rapids."

Also nearby is the beautiful historic Heritage Hill residential district, including the immaculately restored Frank Lloyd Wright designed house (for Meyer May). It’s also a short drive to downtown Grand Rapids, Founders Brewery, and the Gerald Ford Presidential museum.
Despite it being a basement apartment, it’s windows provide plenty of natural light and a great cross-breeze. Jill & Jim have made their space very cozy, including a comfortable bed and comfy leather armchair. This place is extremely clean & peaceful. Plus, they provided yogurts, granola, tea & coffee, which were welcome surprises for a quick breakfast to start our morning."

They have delicious food and great breweries, cute shops and stores all near by. Plus their neighborhood is charming. The apartment was very clean, with plenty of extra pillows and towels available. Jill and Tim have the apartment filled with trinkets from the GR area, menus for their local eats and some snacks and tea if you can't quite get enough while you are out.

The accommodations were as described (lacking nothing) and even a couple unexpected thoughtful touches.
From the booking through the departure Jill and Tim's communication was expeditious.

Stayed one night","The home was exactly as pictured... beautiful and full of character with modern amenities. A nice comfy bed, convenient seating area in the room, thick fluffy towels, a hot shower and an enormous tub! The common areas were spotless and comfortable too. We stayed in the Grand Room which is in the front of the house so there was some traffic noise. It didn't disturb our sleep, but others may want to book one of the other rooms in the back of the house. As the pictures show, there aren't any window treatments over the windows above the bed, so be aware if you aren't ok with waking up with the sun. The parking and driveway is tight but works, the comfort of the home more than makes up for it. The Heritage Hill area is beautiful. Be sure to tour the Mayer May House, but the free tickets go fast! We did the Pleasant Little Walk by Pleasant Park and viewed many beautiful homes. We would stay with Skyelar again!"

A large seating area, dining area, and a cute sunroom with a few amenities like toaster, micro, and fridge are open to guests. The grand room we stayed in was HUGE with seating for reading, desk space, a large tv, wardrobe for storage, and super comfortable king bed. The bathroom, equally as impressive, had a large original tub, glass shower, and was so roomy. Skyelar left snacks near the Keurig too. Location was perfect for walking to downtown or among the Heritage Hill neighborhood to check out the beautiful historic homes. Just a comfortable and fun place to stay!"

Room was comfortable, private, large and had a good bed.
Host was very responsive and easy to work with.

Another super plus to this home is the private parking, what a stress reliever knowing your car will remain safe as you go about your day on foot (as it is located within walking distance from Downtown GR) or grabbing a quick Lyft after a long day of fun!

Stayed a few nights","Lovely historic home with only a few guest rooms but a huge elegant living room, dining room and sunroom with snacks for you to enjoy. The pictures do not do the ""Grand Room"" justice because the room was so much bigger and prettier in real life, more like a suite with tons of built in closet storage and a unique antique bathtub. Walkable to downtown businesses, funky Eastown and gourmet paradise Martha's Vineyard, this spot is convenient in all directions. The driveway parking is pretty tight but it works if everyone follows the instructions on how to pull in at an angle, and based on this walkable location, you may just leave your car there anyway. Very responsive and friendly host."

There is parking provided nearby but in addition, we had an easy time with street parking when needed. We highly recommend staying here!"

Kelly & Jeff have thought of everything to make guests feel at home, from extra toiletries to complimentary snacks and gourmet coffee pods. We were no more than a 15- minute walk from everything we wanted to do over our son's graduation weekend - and we got to decompress in a spacious, comfortable space. If there were guests in the other suites, we never heard them. What a gem!"

Truly a wonderful place to stay if you’re ever in Grand Rapids and wonderful hosts to go along with it.

We were so impressed by both of them - and together they provided 5 bedrooms, two fully stocked kitchens, 2 living rooms and 5 bathrooms. I have never stayed at an Airbnb before that was so thoughtfully stocked with everything we could possibly think of in both the kitchen and bathrooms. The location was wonderful - easily walkable to great restaurants, bars, and events. We are very discriminating when it comes to accommodations, and this experience exceeded every expectation. Highly recommend."

We loved the foyer that allowed quick access to the Lehigh Suite next door. When both entrance doors were open, it felt more like a large home, than two separate apartments. We used the Drumlin Suite for the groomsmen to get ready in. This place was spotless. It was also well appointed. Items were definitely purchased with the guest's comfort in mind. The driveway is heated so we didn't need to worry about snow/ice in the winter. The Inn on Jefferson is located conveniently to downtown."

They've put thought into every square inch of the spacious loft. Everything from the super fast wifi and charging pads, basket of toiletries in the bathrooms, birthday candles in the kitchen drawer to the extensive booklet that anticipates any question you may have in the spotless 2 story loft. Everything is done thoughtfully and purposefully. Super responsive from pre-check in to ck out.
This is easily one of the best AirBnB properties I've ever stayed at. Will definitely come back if I am in GR again!"

The location is centrally located with plenty of on-street parking. Upon arriving, we were greeted with a beautiful welcome basket complete with snacks and a very detailed guide to the home and neighborhood. The place is spacious and meticulously designed with modern, clean finishes. Our stay was truly top notch.

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at the Drumlin Suite went beyond our expectations. I already knew that the home would be beautiful but every detail was something to look at. I planned a surprise trip to Grand Rapids for my boyfriends birthday and had mentioned this to Kelly & Jeff. They were so accommodating and sweet to use the décor that I had sent and hang it prior to our arrival. I was blown away at how well decorated the house was and my boyfriend felt very special too. They even had a card and a 6pack of local brewed beer with his name on it. That was a thoughtful touch! Communication with Kelly and Jeff was always quick. I had some questions about where to order a cake and they recommended a few local bakeries. I ordered the cupcakes and Kelly & Jeff offered to pick them up and have them in the suite before we arrived. That saved me so much time and the worry on having to get them without Mike finding out. The keypad entry eased our mind, the readily available amenities, the comfortable beds and extra pillows/blankets were a great perk. The Drumlin Suite had a hotel feel and nothing was lacking. We even forgot to bring shampoo but have no fear because each of the bathrooms had a stocked shower with Shampoo, Conditioner and Body wash. The location of the Suite was also great! Walking distance to most of the downtown restaurants, breweries and bars was awesome. Even being on the main road, the home was well insulated and we could not hear any traffic or city noise. I really cant say enough good things about these hosts and the homes that they provide. My boyfriend and I were very impressed and so happy that we could spend a special weekend at such a beautiful home. It was everything that we were looking for and we will definitely recommend it to our family and friends. Thank you Kelly & Jeff for all that you did. You really outdid yourself! We will definitely be back!

Stayed a few nights","Austin’s place is a gem! Perfectly sized & located with a great “sense of place” in a GR historic mansion. Make sure to read Austin’s AirBnB Local Guidebook - We took some of his great suggestions. As noted, the apartment is up two flights of stairs but we found the stairs to be very manageable, the apartment to be very quiet at the rear of the house, and even on a hot weekend the AC kept it cool and comfy. Accommodations were exactly as described and pictured. Austin was a responsive and helpful host who is a wealth of information about GR!"

Stayed a few nights","To Austin, or anyone reading this considering a stay here in Grand Rapids…DO IT!
Seeing the place on the app was one thing (amazing), but being there was an EXPERIENCE! Austin has designed the comfiest, and coziest place I’ve ever stayed.
The apartment felt catered to me, being a musician myself. I was in awe at his book collection, and having a piano on hand (get it?) helped keep me active, even while on vacation!
Location wise, it was just perfect. Located on a quiet, safe residential street, yet 5-8 minute walking distance from all the action of the city! Anything I needed that I forgot to pack was JUST down the road and I loved that convenience.
Austin was also the first renter that has been so attentive to any needs/questions/concerns I had. From before I even left Boston, Austin had reached out and I never felt alone while adventuring around. Truly wish we could’ve met, but perhaps another vacation?
Austin, thank you, thank you, THANK YOU for all of your help and opening your home to me and mine :)"

Stayed a few nights","Catherine has a gem of a place. One of those places that you look at when you travel and wonder what it would be like to live there. You're staying within her ""home"" not at some converted room or garage. You'll love walking up the stairs to your very private room with its own bathroom and amenities. The whole thing reminded me of what AirBnB used to be like in the past. People opening up their homes for you to enjoy and have a real local experience. My visit to Grand Rapids related to a family emergency with Catherine's home being just a few minutes to the Children's Hospital. Everything is close and there are a lot of great restaurants nearby. Next time that I'm back in Grand Rapids I will not hesitate to seek for another stay here."

Her home is perfectly located walking to local trendy neighborhood local restaurants; a Frank Lloyd Wright home (the Meyer May house) and also walking or a short uber/bus ride to downtown.
You can get all the best the central area of GRR has to offer while stepping away to a peaceful and quiet spot. Her room is perfect size for individual or couple traveling, the bathroom super clean, great amenities (in room cofee, TV, wifi, toiletries) and a lush tile bath with shower, tub and a heater for those who love pampering themselves.
Like the first time, we would definitively come back to Catherine's"

Catherine's place is in the historic Heritage Hills neighborhood, few steps away from Frank Lloyd Wright's Meyer May House and President Gerald Ford's boyhood home. The house is ample, clean and wonderfully appointed. The porche allows for a relaxing evening and it is only a few steps away from the Wealthy St. trendy establishments or a 20 min walk to downtown's venues. Her street is quiet, easy to access and packed with historical residences. Parking was easy and hassle free - unlike hotels, no need to park in a ramp, deal with charges and having to drag luggage around.
We stayed while in town for a Broadway show and definitively would do it again.
Catherine was very communicative, provided us with accurate information and was there to give us a warm welcome and help us with pointers about our stay.
Better than many other spaces in the area and certainly beats a hotel stay."

The bedroom and bathroom were roomy, very clean, and had everything we needed. The king bed and linens were very comfortable. The weather was dreary, cold and damp, but this home is warm, beautiful, and cheerful.
We highly recommend Catherine's home. For all the above reasons it is an excellent value. We will be happy to return there on our next trip to Grand Rapids."

We visited in December when it was very cold and after they had a huge snow storm. Her driveway, pathways, and steps were well cleared and salted. The room was as described and had a very comfortable bed and nice shower. The room was cozy and warm. There were space heaters in both the bedroom and bathroom. The room was spacious and had a chair and bench to sit on as well as a large chest of drawers for clothes. We visited around Christmas time and her place was well decorated inside and out. Catherine's place is an extremely good fine in heart of Grand Rapids. She is very welcoming and responsive. Check in and out was easy. Her place is a gem. I hope we are luckily enough to book this place next time we visit."

Stayed a few nights","We were in Grand Rapids for a wedding and arrived late to Catherine's place. I thought I'd sent her my eta. Even though she hadn't received it, she was gracious and welcoming when we arrived after 8 p.m.
The room was wonderfully comfortable and lovely. The bed is luxurious, the room is quite private, and the bathroom is roomy and well-equipped We appreciated the cold bottles of water since it was one of the hottest days in Michigan history, as was the day of the wedding. The room, with adequate AC plus a ceiling fan and an oscillating fan, was plenty cool for the hot days. We couldn't hear anyone else in the house, even though the family live there. Common rooms are gorgeously decorated, but we really stayed in our room or outside walking in the neighborhood or at our events. The room also has a little fridge, nice tv with lots of streaming services, K-cup with coffee & creamer, and a writing desk. Very cozy. The neighborhood is lovely. You can also walk to many restaurants and shops. A cultural experience! You'll love it!"

Stayed a few nights","The location is great and the home has the typical historical charm featured in Heritage Hills. Grand Rapids has limits on short term rentals and we are VERY familiar with them. That being said, it should be noted that Catherine does reside in the home AND her boyfriend was there overnights during our stay. We were the only guests as the city does not allow more than 2 guest per rental. Here are some things to consider when booking:
*Catherine’s bedroom is literally arms distance from the suite so there’s limited to no privacy. Waking up due to doors slamming, vacuuming etc just isn’t ideal accommodations.
*The suite was extremely warm when we arrived. Catherine made us aware that she didn’t turn on the AC until 4:30p (check in is at 4p) because she was on vacation and doesn’t like to leave it running when she isn’t home. It took a long time for the room to cool comfortably as we arrived around 830p.
*Guests DO NOT have access to control the AC and we woke up both mornings sweating as it was turned OFF
*After dropping off our luggage we went to grab food. Upon returning, the front door to the house had been chain BOLTED from the inside by Catherine. She said she doesn’t like to leave it unchained after a “certain time” which I found to be a passive aggressive way of telling us she isn’t comfortable with guests coming and going “late” hours. Mind you, it was hardly 1030pm. She stated didn’t know if we had checked in yet which was odd seeing that she has a security camera system AND we sent her a msg through the app at 8:26p letting her know we had just arrived.
*The door to the suite was inoperable at the time of our stay and we were told to enter and exit through the bathroom. There’s no way to lock the suite from the outside which presented a security and privacy issue.
*We kindly let her know the next evening we would be out really late and arriving back around 4am to attend an event because we didn’t want to be locked out the home. She then asked if we could not use the shower when we arrived back as the shower is “quite disruptive”. We weren’t comfortable with not showering however we felt like we didn’t have a choice as Catherine had already made the stay less than desirable by locking us out.
*The suite is not suited for relaxing and sleeping in as there are only staging shades on the windows making it extremely bright. Lights from passing vehicles on the street presented a sleep disruption at night. You can see straight through the bathroom windows as well from the outside as the very sheer window coverings presented little to no privacy so we found ourselves showering with the lights low or off.
We ended up cutting our stay a day earlier than planned and extending our time in the city some place else. Catherine was more concerned with us not giving her a bad review vs asking how she could make our stay more comfortable when I told her we were leaving. She later sent a msg in response to a partial refund request stating she was windowed and retired and needed the income. Well, we are fully retired and disabled veterans but that doesn’t change the fact that Catherine made our stay uncomfortable and inconvenient. She needs to include a more detailed written listing with her “rules, stipulations, and preferences” PRIOR to booking so guests have the OPTION to decide if this suits their needs. She later attempted to push blame and responsibility to us by telling us we should have selected accommodations more suited to our needs, which of course wasn’t the issue at all, and she never actually addressed the problems. My partner and I are both well into our 40s and didn’t like that we had to let the host know when we were coming in so we wouldn’t be locked out. Our stay felt more like a boarding school than a BnB."

It was maybe a 20 min walk to downtown, which was great both during the day and late at night. The room and bathroom were cozy and had a lot of charm. No problems of any kind. 100% would recommend."

This house is a renovated old soul home on a large lot in a rejuvenated area within a block of cobblestone street shops and restaurants. Stephanie's place is warm, relaxed, welcoming and well appointed, with unique historic charms. Her thoughtful provision of absolutely everything that might make our stay easier was noticed and very much appreciated. Would heartily recommend to all families staying in GR!!"

She even came over to help with a couple things and was quick to respond to any messages. Everything is clean and nice. Central air and ceiling fans were a blessing in the summer heat. She even gave snacks and beverages!
We came here with my 16 month old and they even have a high chair, pack and play, and stroller. Just had to make sure she didn't get into any non baby proofed parts but that's true with most air BNBs anyway!
I loved it. 10 out of 10 I'd come here again."

I normally avoid listings like this because I value my privacy, but I felt comfortable booking it after reading reviews about how this tiny house provides a lot of privacy. I am very glad that I decided to do that because my wife and I could not be happier with our stay.
The tiny house is exactly as described. It is very obviously well-built, including the fixtures inside. It is an ideal size for two people. We did not feel cramped at all as the interior is surprisingly spacious. We are very satisfied with every element of our stay and will definitely check availability the next time we return to Grand Rapids."

Stayed a few nights","My fiancée and I had a weekend business trip to Grand Rapids. While we enjoy downtown GR, we were also hoping to be able to unwind a bit while we were away for the weekend. Amy's place was the perfect fit: only 15 minutes from Downtown, we were able to zip in and out of the city for the meetings that we had. But we were far enough away, in a quiet neighborhood, that we were able decompress, relax, and enjoy some much needed time away after our other obligations were done.
We've stayed in ""tiny houses"" before and found that people tend to take pictures in such a way that make the space look much larger than it actually is. Amy seems to have done the opposite: when we opened the door at check-in we were blown away by how big the place really was. Once the door shut behind us, the decor and size of the place made it feel like we were standing in a full sized studio apartment. And with a full kitchen, bathroom, washer/dryer, couch, and bed, the space had everything we needed."

We had an internet problem one evening and they were very quick to respond and troubleshoot and got us back up and running quickly. As warned, Amy has a full house of kiddos so there was lots of activity around the house (this was summer time) but everyone was friendly and quiet at night."

It has absolutely everything you could need and even had small details that you wouldn’t think about so you can tell they put great effort into making sure their guests are properly accommodated. Amy was super responsive and let us check in early and check out late which was super appreciated and nice of her to allow. I can’t recommend staying here more and would give this stay a greater than 5 stars if possible. We loved it!

Stayed a few nights","The stay was amazing. This may seem minor, but the comforter they had for the bed was the most comfortable one I’ve ever used. They even had a Netflix account set up that we could use, I mean I have netflix anyway, but it was still a nice additional feature. The only issue we had is that there was no oven fan. It seems a little silly to have a stove/oven but no fan for it. The regular ac unit was across the room, so our smoke detector went off quite a few times while trying to cook because of the kitchen setup and the lack of an oven fan. The water pressure is also a little weak, but for a renovated pool house and for the price, it was absolutely amazing. I would definitely stay there again."

Stayed a few nights","Amy and her husband, Chris, were great hosts. We wanted to stay in to watch a college football game instead of going out to the bar and they made sure to set the tv up to get the channel we needed. Also in conversation with Chris, coffee came up and how we forgot to bring coffee creamer. They went out and got us a fresh bottle of coffee creamer. It's those small things that made our trip worthwhile. Also, the tiny house is adorable!"

Group trip","My friends and I loved this place. The location was great to everything on Cherry, Wealthy, & Fulton and extremely short drives to both Eastown & Downtown. The location was clean and looked just like the photos. I can see parking being difficult during the winter months as street parking must alternate on which side of the street you park during odd/even days after November 1. The price of the AirBnb is expensive but if you have a large group to evenly split the nights I definitely see it being worth it."

Parking in the street was very easy since we were there Friday after 5 pm and weekend. They only enforce paid parking mon-fri 8 am to 5 pm.

There is a small patio off the primary bedroom which would benefit from a small patio table and chair.The restaurants nearby are great.The best is Grove followed by Maru sushi.The Cherie Inn cafe, located directly under the apartment was just ok,not as nice as the website reviews of it suggest. It’s only open in the morning, so the noise was minimal.Parking on the street was good, apartment from Saturday night."

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I stayed here for a long weekend as a birthday get away for my wife. We live in Michigan so this was just a get- out-of-towner to visit Grand Rapids. This place is better than advertised! 2 things: accommodations and location! First, this is a completely, newly renovated Loft Style Condo. Wonderfully laid out with new everything. Add to this, the host has paid attention to detail, you really don't need to bring anything (except food and drink). Kitchen has coffee maker with coffee, dishes, towels, linen, washer/drier. Has wifi, a shuffle board, which we used, and Xbox which we did not use. And when it comes to food and drink, the loft is above a diner, across the street was a high end wine store, a tavern, a book store, a specialty coffee store, an ice cream shop, and multiple restaurants, etc. within 1-2 blocks! Plus, you are only a 6 min drive to the VanAndle Arena and other venues. We went to 3 nice restaurants in town and the Listening Room. Was an easy in and out of downtown. In my humble opinion, this place is a gem if you are looking to enjoy a cool area of Grand Rapids (East Town) with a smooth, light urban vibe. The only slight draw back is no dedicated parking (there is street parking) but we never had an issue finding a spot directly in front. The Host Max was great in ensuring we were comfortable in our stay. We definitely will be back."

Stayed one night","This one's as simple as it gets. If you're coming to Grand Rapids, stay here.
End of story.
Purpose-rebuilt basement done up as one-BR one-bath unit. Main room combines full-function kitchen and living room. Bed is VERY comfortable full king (BOY did we appreciate the difference between king and queen this trip), living room area is comfortable, kitchen is ridiculously well stocked, shower is great and, again, bathroom is ridiculously well stocked.
You're also in the middle of the hippest neighborhood of a hip town, away (but close) from the downtown clutter, and with about 30 cool restaurants in walking distance.
The basement issue didn't affect our stay...minimal sounds from above.
Oh, and lest I forget...SPACE IN THE GARAGE.
One thing this trip did is bring home clearly the difference between AirB&Bers who see themselves as your HOST and those who see themselves as just property owners. Diana is a host. A lot of thought went into making this place perfect.
We'll be back."

Stayed a few nights","Diana's place was as advertised and more! Easy to get to and located in a historic area. 1/2 block from Wealthy St. which had tons of dinning option from simple to sophisticated. The accommodations are exactly as pictured! Good thing because my first day in Grand Rapids it rained all day. I informed Diana that I would be staying in pretty much the entire first day and she quickly responded welcoming me as well as letting me know that there was a heater in the closet if needed as the temps dropped at night. The temp is the unit was perfect! Diana has the atmosphere at a perfect setting as there's constant airflow but it never got too cold. Even still, she offered to accommodate and change the temp if needed. No need, everything was just right!
I've stayed at my far share of AirBnB's but this one is easily on my top choices. I'll be going back to Grand Rapids in October and I'll for sure check to see if this unit is avail for those dates. Thanks Diana!"

The space felt very private and peaceful, especially at night and during the day while we worked remotely from the dining table. The location was great, just one block away from Wealthy St and tons of restaurants and a few shops. Diana was communicative and thoughtful in her preparation for our stay, including dog toys, water bowls, etc. The place was pristinely clean and the kitchen was stocked more than enough for us to cook dinner and breakfast. It was a nice home-away-from-home while on the road."

Stayed a few nights","Details on check in were provided, with pictures. Having the garage space to park with details on how to go about it was great since we didn't plan on driving around much this made it easier to have a space right there instead of on the street. Diana sent several messages the day of providing us with updates as check-in approached. She even decorated the space since I had mentioned that we were coming up for my birthday. There was more than enough space for my husband and I. Plus all of the amenities that you could possibly need for longer than our two night stay. Motion sensor lights in the driveway/stairwell, as well as under the cabinets in the apartment, plus night lights in the bathroom and bedroom so it never felt like you were stumbling to find our way in the dark. Wealthy Street was within walking distance for plenty of restaurants, drinks, coffee and shops. Beautiful area, loved our visit!"

You are greeted by the most beautiful garden upon arrival, the place is CLEAN with so many thoughtful touches. Diana did everything in her power to make sure we were comfortable and went the extra mile to make sure we had a great stay with her suggestions. The location was so close to Wealthy St shops (our favorite was Outdoor Coffee) We stayed for a week with our two pups and Diana gave us doggie items to utilize which was extremely thoughtful. The bed was clean and comfortable and the place is very taken care of. This basement apartment was pristine, cozy, and the perfect place for our Grand Rapids stay.

Firstly, the neighborhood is delightful! Peaceful & welcoming, yet near the city center and so many trendy restaurants and pubs/bars nearby.
That’s just geography though, what really matters to me is the host, and Diana is exactly what any traveler hopes for!
She was responsive prior to check-in, even accommodating a change in the time and if you’re the type who just wants to get in and out without meeting your host, the check-in process is straight forward and simple, yet secure.
The space is exactly as described, if anything she undersold it in the listing as she has gone above and beyond with the quality of things!
The bath towels were clean, high quality linens & plenty of them! Also, extra blankets, Bluetooth speaker, water pitcher with filter, & even an essential oils diffuser.
Don’t let the affordable price or downstairs location fool you, this space is top notch!
Bravo Diana!"

It was also what I needed to relax and decompress from hectic work life! It is also in walking distance of restaurants (and a good outdoor coffee place ). If I ever need another place to stay in GR I will definitely check if Diana’s place is available."

It was our first time in Michigan, and this place helped ensure we had the relaxing vacation we were looking for, while being close enough to things to do when we felt like getting out and sightseeing. Amenities were well stocked, host was communicative and proactive, and the area is great-all in all, everything you could hope for when booking a stay. <3
Next time we come to Michigan, we will definitely be booking with the same host. :)"

If something is needed, let them know and they will do what they can. I appreciated the efforts they put into their property. I will definitely be keeping this location in mind for the future."

Stayed over a week","I stayed at the Broadway Bungalow for a little over a month.
Pros: Jonathan’s communication was excellent (I had a few minor issues/requests that Jonathan quickly responded to). The place is cute, and the kitchen is well stocked. There was always plenty of parking on the side street. A few top notch establishments nearby, only a 5-10 minute walk. I worked remotely, and loved the sit/stand desk. Internet speed was great! The shower always had hot water (though you have to let it run for a while to heat up).
Cons: The steps to get into the unit are really steep. The couch is a bit worn, and the place was pretty dusty in spots. They’re remodeling the first floor, so during the day it was noisy (but quiet in the evenings). When the temps were cold, the space was chilly. I imagine once the first floor is done/heated, it will help keep the unit warmer. The bed was a bit firm for my liking.
Overall, it was a decent place, and Jonathan’s communication was top notch."

Stayed a few nights","Brian and Erica were extremely nice, they even accommodated our early check-in. They had wonderful recommendations and were always fast to respond to any questions we had. The location is AMAZING!! walking distance to anything you'll need. Although getting in, is a bit challenging. I do wish it would have been a bit more clean, and made more clear on the shared shower and it's size. It's quite small and the used bar of soap, and hair on the shower wall is definitely not what I expected. I also wasn't made aware that they have animals. Luckily I don't mind but someone else might 🙂 I would definitely suggest hiring a new housekeeper for the future. This is an absolutely beautiful home and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a home away from home. Again, Erica and Brian were both so dang nice. They also have great plant taste. That may have been my favorite part!
If you're thinking about staying here, do it! you won't regret it."

Very cozy, lovely decor and an all around unique and eclectic Airbnb. The hosts were responsive, had thought of everything and made sure we didn’t have to really ask any questions with their thoughtful additions to the place. The loft with massive window was a fantastic way to enjoy an urban condo. I fell in love with the decor and feel of this renovated high school gymnasium. (I want the Frida Khalo bathroom mirror and hanging star lamp !) The bed was comfortable and tucked away in the loft away from the massive window to give you nice ambient morning light. The kitchen was huge with a massive amount of counter space and a beautiful Boos Block island! Barely noticed neighbors and enjoyed hearing the highway traffic for that wonderful white noise. Thank you for a great place to stay!"

Stayed one night","This is The Place to stay if you’re staying in Grand Rapids. The other glowing reviews do not exaggerate at all! Brian and Erica have rightfully earned their Superhost status. They were super friendly - from our initial inquiry, the booking process, to our virtual check-in and tour. We basically had the entire place to ourselves as the hosts were staying on their other property. My husband and I always love to stay in unique stays when we travel, and this truly was a one-of-a-kind. This stay felt like staying in a museum - the place is filled with artful, carefully curated pieces that weave a beautiful and cozy experience, from the floors that are original to the school’s gymnasium, to the original school furniture that the hosts purchased when the school was converted into living spaces. Our only qualm was we didn’t get as much time to truly enjoy all features the space had to feature (we only stayed a night); next time, we’ll definitely check out the rooftop pool! 10/10 stars"

Easily walkable to great restaurants, other downtown attractions (we walked to DeVos Performance Hall, along the river - on a hot day it might've been a bit much, but in good weather it was a very nice walk). Really hope to have a chance to stay here again. Thank you, Brian & Erica!"

Stayed a few nights","We’ve seen old schools repurposed into housing but never from the inside. The condo was unique and fun. It is in a great location. Restaurants and breweries and the DeVos center are very walkable. Our only reservation is the space itself. We clearly didn’t read to understand the living area. The photos of nearly 1200 square foot unit are misleading. The space for rent/use is the 500 square feet mentioned on the 3rd floor consisting of a bedroom, bathroom and small living area. All in all, it was a great space, our expectation was just different coming in."

Stayed one night","This is a three level condo in a building that was once a high school. The unit itself was part of the gynasium and has hard wood floors that you would see in a gymnasium. There are three floors to the condo. On the first floor is the fully stocked kitchen, a powder room, a living room and a patio. On the second floor is an office. On the third floor is another living room, a full bathroom with a small walkin shower, and the bedroom. There is a huge window that is as tall as two of the floors. The unit is decorated with Mexican art, Frida art, and folk art. The parking lot is across the street from the building. Just a five minute walk are restaurants and breweries."

Brian and Erica also donate a portion of the Airbnb profits back to local organizations and I have never seen any other host doing this and thought it was amazing.

Stayed a few nights","Some people describe their Airbnb as a gem and others don't. Brian and Erica's beautiful home is more than a gem. The fact that it is in an old high school building(Union HS) the charm just starts there and continues to their incredibly cozy home. They were more than ""superhost"" . Not only did they give us the entire place to ourselves, but gifted us with one of their local breweries as a welcome, along with a variety of snacks, coffees and water.
Their amazing home was so close (walking distance) to many places on Bridge Street, which offers two breweries, many restaurants and two museums: Butchers Union, One Bourbon, Holland Brewery and Atwater Brewery, The Ford Museum and The Public Museum which has a very cool carousel are a must to go to. Also, walking distance from their home was the Six Street Bridge which crosses you to the other side of the river where you will find: City Built Brewery (latin inspired cuisine), Field and Fire Cafe(great breakfast and the river view awesome), Linear Restaurant (fancy, great atmosphere) and other great restaurants as well as Look Out Park. (if you are willing to climb the 145 stairs) the view to downtown GR is worth the climb. ""yes, I counted them!!!""
The Dash Bus-51 and 52 (which is free) will take you downtown where you can go to the Art Museum and explore what the downtown has to offer. David and I were blown away at how close their home was to so many places to visit and explore.
We went to GR, Michigan as I am on a quest to run all 50 states. Michigan was my 25th (halfway there.) We flew from NJ to GR, not knowing what to expect. It was an unforgettable experience and Brian and Erica's home made it happen, not only by their location to so many things but also, how comfortable and safe we felt in their home.
We would definitely love to stay at their lovely home, if we ever go back to explore some more of GR!!
Cheers,
Gresy Johnson and David Solin"

Stayed a few nights","The space exceeded our expectations and we are excited to return! The location is walking distance to DT GR and anything you'd ever need - food, beer, coffee, grocery... It's a tri-level space with a large window that spans entire unit - be prepared for getting in your steps for the day ;). This old school building was repurposed very creatively and retained much of the original materials seen throughout the building/home (floor, steel beams, doors, etc.). There is a pool and game room that we didn't realize (likely missed it in the write up) but will take advantage next time! The bed and living space was comfortable and the beverages and snack were a very nice (and generous) touch! We ended up having the whole unit to ourselves because the owners were out of town - otherwise, this is an open/shared space so that could be an issue if you are wanting more privacy (they airbnb the 3rd floor - living space, bedroom, bath; the 2nd floor is their master bedroom and office space; the 1st floor is the kitchen, living room, bathroom, balcony). P.S. It seems they may be out of town often - building a another home. Also worth mentioning if you missed it - Brian & Erica donate back to those in need with each stay in their place - very generous and heartwarming to see good being done."

Stayed a few nights","If you are traveling to Grand Rapids, try your best to stay in Erica and Brian’s condo — it was incredible! You’ll be in a gorgeous three story condo with stunning floor-to-ceiling windows and warm, arty decorations. Their condo is in the building of an old high school, and there are some awesome features (like the original wooden gym floors) still in place. The condo is a work of art and slice of history, we felt so lucky to stay there.
Above all, Erica and Brian are incredibly warm, welcoming, and friendly. While we did not get the chance to meet Brian, we had the pleasure of meeting Erica, who is just fantastic. Everything you could ever ask for in a host—kind, friendly, great recommendations, and very responsive. She also clearly cares for, and is involved with, the Grand Rapids community. Finally, a note for LGBTQ+ travelers: I felt super safe and welcome here! I reached out to Erica and Brian beforehand, and they were super supportive and made it clear they are very welcoming of LGBTQ+ guests. Grand Rapids itself seems quite queer-friendly, too—I’ve never seen so many Pride flags in one city!
Thank you, Erica and Brian, for a truly amazing AirBnB stay, you are AirBnB at its best."

Brian and Erica have decorated with an array of eclectic art objects and wall pieces. We walked to many local restaurants and attractions. We recommend them as welcoming hosts!

The location is within walking distance to several breweries and driving distance to many more. The building had a lot of history that Erica kindly shared with us and was such a fun experience. I definitely recommend downloading the Brewsader app if you enjoy beer or cider! Definitely would stay again!!!

Stayed a few nights",The definition of a five-star listing!!! Brian and Erica’s home was even better than described. The bed was wonderfully comfy and we had everything and more that we could have needed during our stay. Part of our visit was a celebration of my friend’s birthday and Brian and Erica SO kindly had a bottle of local wine waiting for us when we arrived! The rooftop pool is incredible and we had the amazing fortune of meeting some other residents while we were up there who invited us to a fun get together on their attached rooftop deck! All in all we couldn’t have had a more wonderful experience with Brian and Erica’s airbnb. The only “negative” was that they were out of town the majority of the time we were there so we didn’t get to know them as well as we would have liked!! It just means we will have to come back again another time!!!

Stayed a few nights","We have stayed at many air b and b's, This was our first disappointment. For starters we felt rushed during arrival, The listing shows kitchen, balcony and living room. Apon arrival it was made known we were not welcome in those areas. The loft was dirty( dirty sock, dust and film on surfaces and a dirty coffee pot) the floors were dirty the bathroom had no hand towel, wads of brown hair around the floor of the bed. The hottub was down (but we were understanding of the maintenance issues) The whole house stunk and we found a cigarette in the bedside stand. We were so dissapointed we booked for 2 days after waking up and being able to see we left after 12 hours and booked another air b&b. It has been dissapointing that they have not been cooperative in refunding the day that we did not stay, even with pictures of the issues. We hope this can be a learning experience and other other have a better experience than us."

Their suite has several amenities (TV, coffee, snacks, hydration) ideal to relax, work or play. The rooftop boasts a great view of the skyline and the hot tub an ideal spot to enjoy a snowy Winter day or a sunny summer.
Conveniently located to both downtown and west end highlights, Brian and Erica have an extensive in-depth knowledge of the best spots to visit that only locals would master.

The fans in the bedroom were helpful since I’m always hot, the view on the roof was awesome and the hot tub was perfect. I highly suggest anyone stay here if you’re in the GR area. Especially if you’re looking for a host who wants to show you around and have a good conversation with. (She’s also great at giving privacy if that’s how you prefer your trip). I hope to come back and visit sometime in the future."

Erica was seriously the nicest person ever and super hospitable, her living space was so unique and you could tell every little decoration was personal. She also had lots of local suggestions for us to try out and we enjoyed all of those we tried out.

Stayed one night","Can't recommend this place highly enough! I was a little nervous going into it because we have never stayed at a rental that is a ""shared space"". But it totally surpassed my expectations! Amy and Bob have created a beautiful space in their basement with lots of lovely little touches to keep you comfortable. I loved their wall of books, the cozy blankets, the sound machine and heated blanket on the bed, and of course the delicious banana bread and snacks. Amy and Bob were very quick to communicate and really respected our privacy. Even though you need to walk a few steps outside your door to the bathroom in the basement, it really felt like the whole space was ours the whole time. Everything was really clean and beautifully decorated. Loved our stay!"

The home is located in a safe neighborhood if you are a walker or a runner. Amy and Bob made it very easy to make a reservation and access the home. There are special touches including a small kitchenette with the ability to make coffee which was provided, along with bottled water and yummy homemade Christmas cookies and banana bread. The apartment-size refrigerator worked great for leftovers from restaurants. The home was exceptionally clean and quiet. The bed is slightly soft and a great sleep experience. Be sure to check out the restaurant sBistro Bella Vita or Butchers Union in Grand Rapids as well as Woodland Mall and Frederick Meijer Gardens-all are an easy Uber ride away if you don’t have a car. We will be back!"
