Very clean, comfortable beds, easy to find. We didn’t make much use of the kitchen but they seemed to have everything you’d need to cook. I absolutely recommend Loren’s home."

But he woke up ready to run outside, play on tractors, swing, climb, and more. We got to see goats, chickens, cows, and even a llama. Our dogs loved the fenced in yard to roam about. Can't wait to stay again."

Stayed a few nights","The place was very much as expected. If you’re looking for a quiet get away during the fall, this place may not be ideal with the corn maze and petting zoo being close to the farm house. We didn’t mind because we are night owls. The porch swing is very peaceful, the house is so cute with modern amenities. As stated on the website, the wifi does leave a little to be desired, but an unplugged weekend isn’t necessarily a bad thing! Weatherford is very close, should you need anything. Loren was very responsive to any needs we had and was an excellent host."

The water pump wasn't working initially, but the host answered the 1st call and fixed it within 10 mins! This is no knock on the host, as anyone who has stayed in rural houses, things happen- the host even offered to stay around for 30 mins at 2-3am to make sure the sensors kept working. We had no issues with the water after the initial; hot & good pressure! Would recommend the host and their place!"

Stayed with a pet","Our son goes to college and plays baseball at SWOSU, so we've been to Weatherford a few times to visit him and watch him play. We visited the farm in October 2021, when he first moved there, and loved the animals and the corn maze. That's when we saw the farmhouse and found out you could stay there. I was hoping we'd get the chance to stay during one of our visits before he graduates, and this past weekend, it was actually available. We are big city people, but we and our boys have always loved the country and the farm animals, so they thought this stay was really cool. Much better than a hotel they said. I loved sitting on the porch setting in the morning to have my coffee, and at night to watch the sunsets. The boys all loved hanging out with the animals. We brought two of our dogs as well, so it was very convenient having the whole yard fully fenced in for them to run and play. We hoped to stay again when we are there for our son's senior weekend, but looks like it's already reserve"

Stayed with a pet","We had a wonderful stay at The Farmhouse. The home was beautiful. It was peaceful. The playground was perfect for my daughter to run around and play as her toy Aussiedoodle followed after. We loved the goats and Alpaca. They were so funny. Owner came out to do chores and asked my duaghter if she wanted to feed the goats. So left us a bucket of feed out before leaving. That was a highlight even the parents. We thoroughly enjoyed our time there. Also our favorite restaurant Luigis was only 5 miles away in Weatherford, Ok. So we made a trip to town for one splurge meal. And cooked the rest of the time at the house. We look forward to coming to stay again."

The tvs with Roku are a great touch for the people who don't want to be outside most of the time. We are aways comfortable and extremely satisfied with our visits. My kids enjoy this place and the sweet animals so much. Some of their best childhood memories will probably be of this place which is priceless, and this is also an affordable option if budget is a concern. Thank you again for making it so special."

We saw chickens in their coop, cattle in the field and the goats and llama in the pen (the goats are entertaining to watch) it’s so relaxing on The farm that we make this a must stop on road trips across the country. There’s plenty of things for children if you have them. There’s a sandbox, swings, slide, and much more. Loren has everything you need at the farmhouse and if you need anything else Walmart is not far away and neither is the town of hydro and weatherford which has plenty of shops and restaurants. The farmhouse is super cozy, clean, and spacious. This is the perfect set up for anyone looking to be in the country and away from the city life. The access to the farmhouse is super easy to find, easy on and off from the highway. We seem to always show up late so the house is lit up and easy to find at night. We will be back again :)"

The Farmhouse is neat and tidy, and the decor is simple and thoughtful ... altogether lovely! There are two bedrooms upstairs, and one of them is very large with two beds.
We are grateful for our stay at the Farmhouse!!"

Group trip",Absolutely perfect! I recently got divorced and had to move 3 hours from where we use to live. Every few months we come visit so my 15 year old can spend the night with their friends. I usually get 2 hotel rooms but thought I'd give this a shot. 100% will do this again. The kids had so much freedom and space. They got to be loud and wild and carefree. It was a blast. The home is warm and cozy and has everything you need. I couldn't be happier.

We all had time to spend with one another vs having to go to a restaurant, which would have been too much on my mother. We absolutely loved the home and location. Christy was responsive on questions that were asked. I loved that she had a book with a time line of the land, home, and previous owners. We would definitely rent it again whenever we can come back."

My daughter found keys in shoes on the back porch, one fit the door and we ended up getting in that way but when the people came to mow we realized they were for them. There were instructions on the table INSIDE but the code in the book didn’t work on the keypad either so without that key we would have never gotten in. While we enjoyed the home very much we were very disappointed that their was zero response to any of our messages by the host."

Christy was an excellent communicator. She responded quickly to any questions. The beds were very incredibly comfy with nice linens. We had everything we needed for our short stay in the kitchen also.
This beautiful home sits on a beautiful red brick street full of historical homes, my grandmother’s being one of them which is to the west. This neighborhood is full of large shade trees and the kindest neighbors you could ever ask for.

We have seven people and there were no linens on the pull out trundle so we had to adjust sleeping arrangements. Also do not plug in the chair as it does not work correctly. Again for a quick overnight stay it was good.

The neighborhood was very quiet. This home is at the very end of road. We never had through traffic.
We truly enjoyed getting away from the lake at night and getting our baths in a tub and shower.
Thank you CE for the pleasant stay and hospitality. We will definitely stay again."

The property is a duplex, and we often choose side B (or II) over A (or I) due to the living room furniture being slightly more comfortable. Can't wait to head back to Elk and book the property"

She was tending to the yard when we pulled up and she was very informative. Once we started getting stuff out of the car, she made a silent exit.
The house was exactly like the description, it had all the comforts of home.
I went for a run around the block and the smell from the field next to the house was INCREDIBLE. Definitely recommend going for a walk at sunset and look at all the wildflowers."

Great accommodations for those traveling with dogs. My dog certainly knew other dogs had been there, but I sure couldn’t tell. Place smelled great, and was clean and tidy throughout.
C.E. was also very good with communication during the entire process. She happened to be next door cleaning when my party checked out, so it was nice to get to thank her in person.
I’d stay here again in a heartbeat."

I’m not sure if the smell was on the other side of the condo but this was definitely a headache to deal with finding a new place to stay when we arrived.

I loved the back story she told about her spotlessly clean, nicely supplied, and perfect place for 4 senior adults to meet, visit & get a great 2 nights sleep. This special ABNB is exactly as described. TV had a great variety & internet was appreciated.
We used the kitchen for breakfast & dinner.
It was easier for us to ‘meet in the middle’ between Edmond Ok & Amarillo Tx.
Sayre is a small Okla. town on Rt. 66. The Denny’s restaurant off I-40 was nice, clean & food was good on the morning we departed.
We did drive the short distance to Elk City. They have an antique carousel in the city park, as well as a few other things to see & Braums Ice Cream Store.
We highly recommend this place !

It felt dreamy and we had everything we needed for a very comfortable stay. The record player was also fun to play. We would definitely stay again."

I was initially worried about staying with my pup in a place with no yard, but there are plenty of green spaces nearby to walk, and Strayhouse was so pup friendly. The chai latte (they brew it in-house) and breakfast croissant next door were also amazing. We couldn’t have had a better experience."

Stayed one night","Geoff’s place was cool and fun. I loved the vintage look and we especially enjoyed listening to the Eagles on the turntable! The apartment was immaculate and comfortable. I was a little unsure of the location at first but once we got settled, I felt perfectly safe. There’s an alley that runs between the apartment and coffeehouse so be aware that you may hear a delivery truck in the early morning hours. I personally wasn’t affected by any noise from it but my husband did hear it. Also be aware that there is quite a large step up to the front door. Neither of these are deal breakers, I would definitely stay again and I recommend this space to others. The coffeehouse next door is great and so convenient! I believe Nicole served us and she accommodated our request for a specific breakfast croissant. It was huge and delicious! The raspberry lemonade is quite tasty too! You won’t be disappointed by booking Geoff’s place!"

The next morning we went to the cafe side and it was so relaxing- the food options were healthy and delicious! Also got a great latte there. Again our puppy was allowed and they brought a water bowl over for him.
The studio is the coolest. Set up really nice and killer bathroom!!!! Walk in huge shower with great pressure and heats up quickly. That fancy toilet and all amenities you need!

Whenever we are coming back through to visit family and friends in Tennessee, we will definitely be wanting to stay here again!"

When inside the Airbnb there is no way to know anything is around the place unless I would open the shade in the to see who's going through the drive-in. Just fantastic place!"

Stayed with a pet","Booked Geoff’s place late on a Sunday night after we had to leave a horrible inaccurately described RV park in Elk City. Wow was this such an upgrade—definitely worth the price and extra drive. Even better than the pictures. Spotless, roomy, cozy bed/linens, beautiful shower, and everything we needed in the kitchen. The area was quiet and black out blinds were wonderful to sleep in. Street parking only which seemed questionable at first since late at night it was like a ghost town but it was safe and upon waking in the morning I was delighted by the quaint town. We enjoyed coffee and an absolutely delicious lunch next door. Would highly recommend Strayhouse!!! I wish there were more Airbnbs with such quality and attention to detail!"

There’s tall steps at the front entry, but once you’re inside, it’s a all one-level, clean, cute, and cozy! The shower is nice & hot with rain style shower head. There’s a nice new toilet with heated seat and bidet. Plus very effective space heater & fan in the bathroom and central climate control with remote in the rest of the place. The kitchenette is well stocked. The bed was very sturdy & comfortable, the lights had dimmer switches, the linens were fresh, and the neighborhood was very quiet at night. We slept great, and in the morning we had delicious breves & lattes next door before hitting the road. I’ll most certainly be back."

Stayed a few nights","The host forgot to update my check in time after agreeing to accommodate my earlier check-in, so I couldn’t unlock the Airbnb when I arrived.
The split heaters never heated the space adequately, even when turned up quite a bit on heat setting. We used the space heaters that were provided.
Our water was shut off without warning or notice for a short period of time due to construction, which was very inconvenient and unsettling to suddenly have no access to water.
The entrance to the Airbnb was missing a step, the wooden step pictured in the description was not there making the first step up around 14-15” if I had to guess. Inconvenient and not safe for tenants with decreased balance and/or mobility.
The entrance to the Airbnb is located on the side of the coffee shop drive-thru. There is no signage indicating to drivers that pedestrians will be entering/exiting in this area.
The host replied very rudely & very distastefully when I asked about an amenity. Won’t be staying here again."

I was traveling through for work from Arkansas to New Mexico and will be heading back in a month in which I will probably book this place if it's available. My favorite Airbnb so far ♥️ p.s. my my little old lady puppy (shes 17) loved it as well , being pet friendly was a huge bonus !!"

Stayed with a pet",Such a great place to stay. My husband and I booked last minute as we were traveling through to our new home in AR. We were thoroughly impressed with all of the finishes and attention to detail. We would stay here again in a heartbeat. I told my husband that I would even live here if given the opportunity.

Note: There isn't a stove here, so plan your eats accordingly.
Long live the bidet!"

Beautiful to look at, comfortable to be in, thoughtfully arranged and stocked, and literally steps away from a good coffee shop with a menu of goodies to choose from to eat. Couldn't ask for more. A wonderful value."

I never would have thought to look in Clinton, but I used the map feature on Airbnb to scroll along the highway looking for something special. We found it! Beautifully designed, lots of extra details. This is NOT your average road trip over-nighter. This place left us relaxed and rested, and a bit pampered, too! And if you’re looking for legitimately good coffee, the shop next door will no disappoint! I highly recommend for those traveling Route 66 or road tripping!"

Stayed one night","A perfect reprieve after a long day on the road. Geoff's spot, along with the neighboring coffee shop are an exquisite find right off the freeway. Every tiniest detail is aesthetically pleasing: the linens, the lighting, the scent of the dish and hand soaps--the place is a modern charm. There's two AC units which can get you as cold as you'd like. The unit is much bigger than the pics can capture. And every review is right on about the bathroom.
Geoff was immediately responsive when I had a question (even on a holiday). Without question, this is my new go-to when traveling to the SW. Oh, and Strayhouse is a serious artisan coffee shop--my espresso was sweet with no bitterness."

I knew we wouldn't have to worry about running out. Pauline gave us her direct number and told us to contact her if we needed anything. The house was close to the water park which was a blast for our kids. It was directly behind Mcdonalds, Braums and close to pizza hut. There is an amazing local mexican restaurant, Canelos, which I highly suggest. We stayed on Easter and the host went out of her way to wish us a Happy Easter and hope the kids were enjoying their easter. I highly recommend staying here. It felt safe and cozy and Pauline was a breeze to communicate with."

But what truly set this Airbnb apart was the host's attention to detail and commitment to ensuring a comfortable stay. From the good Wi-Fi to the cozy cozy feel of the home, every aspect of this Airbnb was designed with the guest's comfort in mind.
In conclusion, this Airbnb offered a fantastic blend of comfort, convenience, and hospitality. It truly felt like a home away from home, and I would not hesitate to return. I highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a quality stay."

That is a lot of space to clean. We didn't have any trouble or need to reach out, but they were responsive when we told them we were checked in and checked out. I see why Jessica and SJ are superhosts. They have a great place and they've made it extremely comfortable. Well done!"

The rooms have locks on each individual door, which is great. Especially when trying to keep littles out of the basement. Plenty of space for everyone to spread out and enjoy each other's company. The neighborhood is nice and quiet, with a great park close by. The local recommendations in the booklet were also helpful. Jessica and SJ we're always quick to respond anytime we needed anything."

We could not have asked for a better host. The house was spotless and the price, in my opinion, is actually too low for how many guests the house sleeps. We had everything we needed in the house and then some. Her personal touch made us feel right at home and I felt like I could ask her anything. She responded within minutes each and every time. We will definitely stay here again when traveling to Clinton. So much better than staying in a drab hotel! Good job Jessica!"

Stayed with a pet","We were so fortunate to find this home on our journey from Michigan to Texas! Jessica was the perfect host. She communicated well, was super helpful, and was very kind. This home was even nicer and larger in person. The home was very clean and had everything necessary to accommodate a small or large group. This was lovely for an overnight stay, and if I needed an extended in the area stay, this would absolutely be my first pick! The location was great. The neighborhood was nice, and it provided enough quiet and privacy while also being close to highway access and businesses. There were some great restaurants to choose from, a water park, and other local attractions. If our trip had been longer, we certainly would have been able to find plenty to do. If you like to cook, and plan on cooking on vacation - this house has a great kitchen - clean, well stocked, and has tons of counter space. The furniture was comfortable and clean. It was a lovely place!"

The decor reminded me of my childhood- Hardy Boys books galore, miniature shuffleboard, that was a hoot, built in spa, fireplace and decor that defines what a ranchhouse is all about. Books, movies galore, antique items throughout, even has postcards available. WOW, this place was amazing, wished I could have stayed a few more days just to browse inside the house. Three beds, 2 bathrooms, a well stocked kitchen and everything inside was immaculate and well organized.
I would definitely recommend the Lazy B to anyone out there, you will not be disappointed one bit."

There’s also a pool in the backyard, a volleyball net and a fishing pond back there too. There also a friendly horse that hangs out nearby. The hosts were very helpful and are great at communicating.
It’s a great place for a staycation or just some relaxation during R&R, or if you’re just in town to visit but don’t want to deal will all of the thrills of the city.
I will book again in the future if I am in the area."

The house was much bigger than I expected and included a huge master bathroom with a jacuzzi tub. There were a lot of activities for the kids to do inside too, such as board games, a rope ring toss, and foosball. We were definitely sad to leave so soon and would definitely like to visit again sometime."

The space would be more than sufficient for a full family as well and the beds were all exceedingly comfortable. Pay attention to the directions to the house provided by Derrick - I just copied the address but my phone got confused and left me on the other side of the noncontinuous main road (but a very kind neighbor actually drove us to the correct half of the street). We had a very comfortable stay!"

Wifi was good enough (speed 1.2 to 4 Mbps - I measured it several different times); latency unloaded 49 ms, loaded 159 ms; upload speed 1.7 Mbps). I used it for work all week and it didn't cut out (sometime you have issues with the stability with it interrupting calls etc. but I didn't experience any of that).

There is plenty of room to spread out, lounge, and interact. The rooms are large and spacious with plenty of storage for bags and belongings.
The kitchen had plenty of dishes and appliances for our family of 5. LOVED the dual function coffee maker as it's a bummer to find just a single-cup machine when you need a whole pot! Large table seating with bartop too makes the kitchen a very usable space.
The Christmas tree was set up and made a great backdrop for some family photos!

Stayed a few nights","We will definitely be adding this place to our list of places to revisit. Kayla sent great directions with the check in information and even sent a message to make sure we had arrived without any complications, as I had expressed concern early with being able to find the location. The cabin was beautiful and cozy."

Stayed one night","Kayla is a super host for a reason. You will not be disappointed.
This place is very tranquil. She even left homemade cookies, which was a real treat from some weary travelers.
We would highly recommend this cabin. We will definitely like to stay here in the future.
Thank you, Kayla."

Stayed one night","Everything was great except for the futon in the living room. It was very small and not comfortable for a small adult to watch tv on or sleep on.
She made fresh cc cookies for us and they were delish!!
Thank you."
