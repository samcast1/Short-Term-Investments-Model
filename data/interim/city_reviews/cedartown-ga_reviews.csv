Stayed a few nights","This could have easily been 5 stars all around other than a communication error. We rented the place based on the pool. However, it was not listed that the pool would not be open until late May. The owner was very responsive to our messages and was apologetic for not letting us now. Just be sure to check if the pool will be available when you book."

Stayed a few nights","This spot was perfect for a fall weekend! It was tucked away in the north Georgia mountains and we had the best view of their small farm. We felt safe and secure the entire time! The bed was very comfy, the tub was easy to step in and out of, there were plenty of towels and places to sit! If we need to come back to this part of Georgia we will check here first!!"

Stayed with kids",Let me first say working with Miss Sandra was easy and she was super helpful. It took us 4 hours to get here due to traffic and she had everything ready to go for us. We were traveling for a softball tournament and we were about 20 min from the fields. This location was perfect. It was nicer and cheaper than a hotel. It was peaceful and quite. We got to enjoy hot chocolate and chill out afterwards. The bed was comfy. We could not asked for a better place. Thank you!!

Stayed a few nights","An extended vehicle repair on the way home from a retreat in the Blue Ridge Mountains brought us to the Farm Cottage- though we quickly realized it was a Divine Appointment! God blessed our stay here with privacy, relaxation, and reflection. The wonderful hospitality from Sandra working with our unexpected schedule and even the gifting of fresh farm eggs was the cherry on top! Comfortable furniture, a full kitchen to prepare meals, and evening mountain drives as we looked for deer (though many days they were standing in the front yard) made this stay perfect in every way! It is great to meet people that have a zeal for the Lord! We will absolutely plan more getaways to the Farm Cottage!"

We enjoyed the pavilion with the relaxing swing benches and the farm area with the animals. The baby goats were adorable and it was a treat petting them. Maybe next time we’ll go in the pool (the water was a little to cool this go ‘round). Communication with the host was excellent, and we received responses almost immediately. The check-in and -out instructions were detailed and clear. We appreciate the attention to detail and care. ¡Muchas gracias!"

Stayed a few nights","The Farm Cottage at Silver Creek must be experienced, because it is so much more than even the beautiful pictures describe. The comfort and style that surround you are a feast for the eyes and honestly all senses, because it's so fresh! Creativity pours from every corner, inside and outside your space. It's an ideal couple's getaway or even as a single traveler in need of a retreat. Close enough to Rome for shopping/food, but far enough out to enjoy the serenity. There are several properties that the family offers with sweet hospitality as a joint venture. We could have explored Rome, but we knew once we arrived that this was a ""hole up with your groceries and pamper yourself"" spot, because it had everything we needed and then some. Incidentally, Sandra and Stacy have booths at a local antique mall, if you would like to take home a piece of your experience. Sandra is lovely to talk to and makes you feel right at home, yet you have the space and needed whenever needed. The peace of God flows over you here, even when the animals greet you ""en voz alta"" when you're reading on the unbelievably comfortable swinging daybed outside. Though our stay was a winter one, we loved every minute. (If you DO decide to dine out, check out The Gravy Boat for breakfast, even to go, and Jerusalem Grill for lunch/dinner.)"

Only knock against this is the surrounding farm and area is quite pretty but you can't see it from inside the rental. The windows looking away from the pool area are covered by landscaping and the two that look out look right out on where you park.

You drive about 15 minutes from the main road to reach this place. It is roomy inside and my favorite part was the bed swing outside under the gazebo area which is next to the pool and has a full outdoor kitchen. Bring a book and you will probably fall asleep on the bed swing.

Stayed a few nights","Really wonderful location, easy to find and very well appointed. The pool pavilion is deserving of more photos! The only two suggestions I have are adding a fan to the bedroom and possibly a tv. The rooms are very large if you're an apt. dweller, it was so much larger inside than the pictures can show. The kitchen was very well suited for a longer stay, with a crockpot, tons of utensils and even more cooking options outside with both propane and charcoal grills. On my next trip I'd love to make use of the fire pit after dark. The bed is perfect for me, pretty firm but delightfully luxurious. Having the stack w/d for wet garments was handy, too. I enjoyed the animals, the wandering friendly kitties, the small dog, the turkeys, goats, and chickens. Miniature horse didn't show his face for me but I'll see him next time :)"

Stayed a few nights","This place is a lovely separate cottage, gated and safe, in the countryside. It's super quiet, quaint, and very cozy. The space is large, has full kitchen, lovely den area, streaming shows at your fingertips, and a large bedroom with COMFY bed/sheets, and large bathroom. It included other residences on site but was still very private and included separate parking. I would most certainly stay here again and am beyond grateful for an affordable, NICE space to stay in the countryside."

Walking into the cottage I was in love with the whole vibe. The cleanliness was impeccable, that’s something that is huge for me. And the decor was absolutely superb, from all the little decorations everything was beyond what I envisioned!
After a day of errands, being able to sit on the back porch was one of the highlights of my trip. I would recommend this cottage who is looking for a beautiful place to relax and feel like home at the same time!

The dog mentioned is one of the sweetest dogs I ever met. It is a small dog that I didn’t hear bark not once during my stay.

I called them to see if they had a step stool I could use to get into the bed which is kind of high. Normally not a problem, but I was still recovering from surgery and it was a bit of a struggle for me. They were on their way to their anniversary dinner (in Tennessee, I believe) so I told them not to worry about it. They texted me the next morning after I left for the day to let me know they had left a step stool by the door for me. It made all the difference for me and the bed is sooo comfortable! I would definitely stay there again and absolutely recommend!"

The hosts were so prompt in calling to check on us and cared enough to make sure we had everything we needed during the short power outage. They even brought a care basket to the Cottage filled with candles and things we might need. It is nice to know we have a place to visit where we feel right at home.

Stayed a few nights","Mark and Annette are so amazing. I don’t think I can put it into words. They helped us out in our most desperate time. We fell into bad luck during our trip but Mark and Annette stepped in; even though they didn’t need to. I can’t recommend them enough as hosts, and cannot say enough words as to how terrific these two people are as individuals. I do want to put out there that getting an Uber or a Lyft may be more difficult if there’s a large event going on, as there are not that many, but a taxi service may be more reliable or maybe rent a vehicle if you must travel. Everything is so walkable the food is great. The community is very welcoming. We will definitely be booking with them again, if they will have us again, when we decide to come back."

Mark and Annette outdid themselves with the decor and all and so many extras!!! We didn't get to use the fire put and toast the marshmallows they put out for us but my husband did eat some . And the natural spring water from the Cave, which is within a nice walking distance, was such a plus. You get more than the moneys worth here. And Rome is in easy driving distance for more , food and fun. Thanks Mark and Annette. We used this as a prayer retreat, my husband and I and it was perfect."

Water Pressure was AMAZING! Great water heater, phenomenal dishwasher!
Kitchen: Spectacular supply! crockpot, mixer, tons of pans and containers that made eating in and enjoying time with family such a breeze!
Internet was used heavily as I work online and had No connection issues when I had to log in. Cell phone coverage was minimal (AT&T) But wi-fi calling worked just fine.
Beautiful yard with plenty of space to enjoy.

The home is exactly as described. The kitchen was well stocked with all the pots, pans, and utensils needed to cook a meal.
The pool was still open when we went and was clean and clear when we arrived. A generous supply of pool / beach towels were also available. Make sure to bring sandals when going out to the pool as there is a small walk across the driveway to enter the pool. The pool was private with plenty of sun and shade.
There was plenty of outdoor lounging space on the front and back porch and around the pool. There was a firepit in the front and a standing outdoor fireplace in the back and wood for both.
The location isn't too close to the hustle and bustle of the city but close enough for a trip to Broad St to see some of what Rome has to offer for visitors.
We really enjoyed our stay and look forward to going back!"

The home was surrounded by woods with a creek, footbridge and fire pit. We enjoyed the pool and it’s space as we would eat then swim as we enjoyed the day. The home is clean, comfortable and has the best set up! Wifi worked like a charm.
We are interested in living down South and Cindy went above and beyond to provide information on the city: schools, housing, restaurants. The time she took with me was so much appreciated.
The house had every amenity including pods for laundry and dishwasher.
We will be back! If we are not lucky enough to grab this place, we will definitely seek out her other Air BnBs!!"

The door under the kitchen sink won’t close and the bathroom ceiling dripped half a pail of water when it rained. We placed a bucket over the toilet, which caught the rainfall. Pretty cute bcuz I love old things but undesired. Back patio furniture and the chairs around the fire pit outside in the front hadn’t been cleaned 4 a while. Overall great stay, awesome views, and beautiful architecture but needs some work. Also, living area has a wasp nest, which my grandkids were obsessed with. It’s natural considering the location but something needs to be done to control wasps on the inside"

Parked the vehicle and just used our bikes the whole time. Rode into town the first day to eat at a local coffee shop and stock up at a grocery store, both of which were very close to the trail. The platform queen-sized bed in the master bedroom was the most comfortable I’ve ever found at any Airbnb or hotel. Wife also really enjoyed the jetted tub. Complimentary bottled and refrigerated filtered water were nice touches. Kitchen was well stocked and equipped and we also appreciated the charcoal grill out back. Cozy well decorated cottage. Makes you feel right at home. Host Julie was also very responsive and helpful."

There were so many thoughtful details. There is firewood for the fire pit and makings for ‘s’mores. Tons of yard and board games. It is just the driveway away from the bike trail. Make sure you follow Julie’s directions though. I was following my husband who was riding the trail from Powder Springs and I discovered county road 94 stops just short of the cottage as the bridge is blocked off! It was just the two of us but there are four bedrooms making this a great place for several couples or families. We definitely want to come back and stay longer in the spring or summer as it is right on the water.

We loved the fire pit and appreciated the extra goodies that Julie had for us (s'mores kits and roasting sticks, popcorn, and oatmeal). The master bed downstairs was very comfortable and I appreciated the basket full of clean hand towels and washcloths. We had a few minor issues with communication and supplies, but things were resolved very quickly. My youngest child is 8, so we were fine, but I could imagine that younger kids might have a difficult time with the antiques in the house and the hardwood stairs to where all of the bedrooms are (except master). All in all it was a great stay!"

Stayed a few nights","This place is special. Anyone biking on the Chief Ladiga / Silver CometTrail should highly consider staying here. It is right off the trail. It is a remote place in the forest with few humans near by. It is 5 miles by bike to the town of Piedmont.
The kitchen is fully set up for cooking, we made particularly good use of the electric skillet and the coffee maker and of course the BBQ.
There are four bedrooms, 3 upstairs with one bathroom and a very nice master bedroom on the main floor with a master bath. The open living area, walls and the floor seem to conduct sound, so don't expect lots of privacy.
You can do your laundry with the washer and dryer. There is ample property on which to have a bonfire, or throw a frisbee.
Julie, the owner is extremely helpful and communicative. Which I find very important."

Group trip","Julies place is the perfect location if you want to cycle through quiet woods along rambling creeks with interesting bridges and mountains and fields. The house is perfectly situated on the trail in a very remote location, but merely 5 miles from the grocery.
Our party consisted of 5 upper middle aged or senior women and 3 senior men. The layout ensured that everybody was in close proximity to the necessities.
She asks us not to park on the grass, but there is ample room to park in the drive. We had 5 cars which easily fit. There is a wonderful front porch and a great screened in back porch. The kitchen has most everything you might need. The living room is very comfortable. And Julie has supplied many games for rainy days or yard play.
I would definitely recommend this stay and hope that we can return. For us it was about the trail. We rode 44 miles from the cottage to Weaver on Saturday, with a stop at Struts in Jacksonville. Sunday we rode out before dawn to the Georgia state line, which was another 20 miles.
Beautiful country. Beautiful cottage and property. Very memorable trip."

The house itself had plenty of room and everything we needed for a weekend get away. We found 3 out of 4 beds to be extremely firm for our taste."

It's a very pretty home, however there are an extreme number of easily breakable items in literally every room, making it a nightmare if you have kids. Also the complete lack of phone service is something you should be aware of. It's also rather hard to find at night. If you want a nice private hideout for a small group of adults than this will be great."

Stayed a few nights","This is such a neat home! Spacious, well decorated, and comfy. It felt like home when we walked through the door. The Christmas tree was lit when we arrived and that was an especially nice touch. We did not realize how remote the home is which wasn’t a negative for us. It made for an interesting ride in the dark as the roads got narrower and changed from pavement to gravel and we wondered if our GPS was correct! There is no cell signal at least for Verizon, so if you’re looking to be unplugged, this house makes that easy for you. You could totally disconnect from the world and give up the WiFi and Direct TV.
We chose this home in place of staying at the Hampton in Jacksonville due to the pandemic. The home was quite clean, Julie was always responsive, and there are lots of games, bikes for the Chief Ladiga trail, the makings for s’mores was a nice touch. I personally loved the screened back porch in the warm sun to read. We didn’t use the fire pit but it was available as was an outdoor heater on the front porch. Julie has clearly gone through what makes an Airbnb house desirable and made those things available to those who stay here.
The book of instructions and local tips was great. We found the Elevated Grounds cafe that was recommended had great coffee, great breakfast wraps and wonderful service.
Although our son graduated from JSU which was the point of our visit, should we return to the area in the future, we would choose this house again."

We especially loved riding toward the Georgia state line/Silver Comet Trail. I also highly recommend kayaking Terrapin Creek while there. It’s a beautiful, fun float. There’s also a great little coffee shop in Piedmont called Elevated Grounds. The coffee, food, and owners were lovely. Our experience was a very nice and much needed get away from home.

We were delighted to find the ""fixin's"" for S'mores right there on the counter and we certainly took advantage of them. It turned out the weather was near perfect for a fire in the fire pit in the front yard. We were kept company by between 5 and 12 deer that were to the North of the house every night. There was also a bunny rabbit that was hopping around the yard. During the day we found large cat tracks behind the house and what looked like the tracks of a small bear along the bicycle trail. But what was best was the night sounds echoing through the mountains as we sat by the fire roasting hot dogs! A perfect get-away!"

The house was wonderful (so clean, cute, and homey) and the hospitality from Julie was excellent (she was constantly in contact, easy to reach, and extremely kind). Julie gave recommendations for things to do in the area (hikes, bike trails, local food, etc). We spent our days going to local parks for hiking (there were so many amazing national parks within 45 minutes of the house). There is also a really nice biking trail right next to the house. The amenities provided at the house were more than you could ask for and the sleeping arrangements were perfect! Plenty of space for a large group or a small couple. We didn't want to leave. I honestly cannot recommend this place enough! Thanks, Julie, for all of your amazing hospitality!"

The whole place is roomy, comfortable and the kitchen fully supplied with everything you need to make a nutritious recovery meal after long days ride. Richard, our host was attentive and responsive to our needs. He went above and beyond by generously supplying us extra butter and bread when we came up short on food supplies! I miss calculated thinking the Roost was closer to town and stores. So bring in food supplies for your multi day rides or stays. We thoroughly recommend The Roost and Richard, plus his pooches. Genuinely warm and inviting. We had a lovely nights stay before biking on to the Alabama/Georgia State line. Our 91 year old Mother rode 38.8 miles with us. I truly believe the good nights rest and recovery at the Roost really made this possible. Thank you Richard!"

From the beautiful fire place at The Manor, to the delish home cooked breakfast, our comfortable room (complete with electric blanket to warm your toes) - we couldn’t have been made to feel more comfortable. We would highly recommend anyone to stay here!!
Myra and Thomas thank you so much!!!"

Stayed one night","This is a great stay! I came to Rockmart for a wedding at ""In the Woods,"" so I didn't really get a chance to use all the amenities this bed and breakfast has. But, the stay was great! Super easy check-in, and Thomas gave me easy directions to find the place and my room. If you're coming on Sunday, breakfast is served early, and I overslept, but they left it in the oven for me and had plates, coffee, and water all ready for me when I woke up!
I'll also note I was surprised with how quiet it was, other people were staying there, and I never heard them leave, and I didn't hear anyone cook in the morning either."

Stayed one night","So my husband and I stayed last night here at the Manor on Becks Lake in Rockmart. We were so impressed with the beautiful lake views and more than anything the sweet hospitality we received from the owners. We felt like and were treated like royalty the entire time. If you enjoy just being outdoors and looking at God's beautiful creations please consider this bed and Breakfast in Rockmart GA. As soon as we checked out I had to share on my facebook page how serene, how beautiful, how relaxing our stay was. So this is what I shared on my FB page for all my friends to see: “ We want to tell you all about a bed and breakfast we stayed in last night. We just wanted to do a little over night visit close to home. And boy did we hit the jackpot. A couple from our church have opened their beautiful home overlooking their ten-acre lake with 50 beautiful acres for walks (or sitting and looking and thinking about walking). They have fishing and kayaking too for those who like that. But oh my goodness the breakfast was absolutely delicious and they made enough for an army. So you are asking where is the gem of a place? How about.....rockmart ga. Yep we went and stayed 15 minutes from our own house and had one of the most peaceful relaxing overnight stays we have ever done. I guess I just want everyone to experience that same welcome we received from this very sweet Christian couple who opened their home to us. The name of this place is The Manor at Becks Lake. And you reserve thru Airbnb. I know Rockmart is close by for us but well worth the trip to go.”"

Stayed with kids","We found this place after lots of searching for a local getaway. I like to believe it was fate. Myra and Tom were such amazing hosts and we couldn't have felt more at home. They welcomed us into their home and made us feel as family. The lake and kayaks were our favorite. The animals on the property were a hit with the kids, the goats were so cute! The pool looked beautiful (not ready for use at this time). They gave us a tour of the property and some back history on it. They made a yummy breakfast for us on each morning of our stay and invited us to join the family for dinner. Our kids just adored them. We will definitely be back to stay at the Manor. Highly recommend!"

Stayed about a week","This charming barn stay was unique in style, location and all the “above and beyond extras” provided by Robin. We saw wild turkey, deer, so many wild birds. It provided country like privacy with the touches of a boutique hotel. There were shampoos, lotions, plenty of linens, a well stocked utensil cabinet with pots, pans, glasses, etc. We especially loved the s’mores kit and danishes left for us!! Just need to mention that it rained while we were here and the sound of it was so pretty on the rooftop. Oh, and working bathtubs overlooking the woods/fields! We highly recommend this place. Go a couple miles down the road for quaint antique shopping, taste local candy or kayak a river. Then, onto Rome for regional events or shopping. Enjoy!!"

We love good food and hiking-highly recommend Doug’s deli in Rome for lunch, Swift &Finch coffee, and Black Bluff Preserve for playing in the creek (short hike with limited parking right in the roadside). All just a short drive from the barn. The ice cream shop in Cave Spring was wonderful. We did fill our water bottles with Cave Spring water which was really good!"

It had so much space and had everything one might need when away from home. Our dog loved playing with sweet Petey, who is one of the calmest and nicest dogs I have ever met!! Petey’s co-host Robin, owner of the Red Barn, was just so kind, caring, and thoughtful. She made us feel like we were part of the family.
Time seemed to slow down during our visit to the Red Barn and it was definitely hard to say goodbye."

Robin’s place was thoughtfully stocked with everything we needed from seasonings for food, to games and books and even s’mores stuff. The views from the red barn are just gorgeous. It’s situated within minutes from the downtown of Cave spring, but how it’s laid it makes it feel really remote. If the night is clear, you’ll have no shortage of stars to see. We have three kids who had the best time running around the property and playing on the play-set. Robin was great and so helpful during the trip. I will recommend this place to everyone and hope to come back once my husband returns from deployment. Thank you for such a memorable experience!"

It was the perfect spot to just enjoy our time together. We are a family of six and had plenty of space. The outdoor space is so nice even in the winter months. We enjoyed our visits from Petey, the dog, as well. We went to Rome, GA for a nice meal and to explore. Cave Spring is a cute little town. We also ventured to Little River Canyon and De Soto Falls in Alabama to hike and see waterfalls. It was a great spot to relax but also has things to do that aren’t far. Robin was also had great communication. We would definitely stay again!"

Stayed a few nights","This was our second stay with Robin. She is always responsive. We knew how to find it.The power went out in Georgia due to a big storm. Robin had candles for us on arrival which was very late because we of a rental car issue delay. She was very helpful to us during this stressful time. She checked on us & still gave us space & privacy. Last time we did not meet her but this time we got to visit a few times & I was so glad did. She is a new friend. We always enjoy the tubs on the deck. We had family visit us as we did last time. My brother in-law enjoys flying his drone planes. It is a perfect place(if you are a good operator, last time was a tilled field, this time tall cornfield!). Robin recommended Joes BBQ in town & the Cave @ Cave Sprgs( which I had planned) as a way to get food & cool off. The food was great! anyplace where you can get turnips & banana pudding as sides with Beef brisket is ok in my book! Full kitchen to cook & lots of rest! Dozens of Fireflies @ night over fields"

Stayed about a week","The red barn was as anticipated and more. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay from the moment we arrived, soaking in the ambiance of rural farm life. Our entire family felt a sense of history of good times, relaxation and country living throughout the property.
The kids enjoyed running and playing in the wide open field and on the play set, the woods and especially Petey, the farm dog. They truly appreciated the landscape and the openness and stayed outside almost the whole time despite it being cold. We built a fire, made s’mores and didn’t turn on a TV or screen even once for the whole week. They did puzzles and arts and crafts and just had fun being kids.
Robin was extremely accommodating and helpful with finding things to do, like going to Cartersville to the Tellus Museum and Chattanooga to the Caves. She even helped us find a great mechanic when we needed brakes because we don’t have hills like this in Florida. Can’t wait to visit the Red Barn again soon."

Robin did send a little bit of money back but not sure if I would stay again , even though robin did try to help , things just seemed to keep happening that made it very uncomfortable and my kids didn't sleep well .

and those tubs on the deck! we chose this spot specifically to celebrate the conclusion of my 500-mile walking pilgrimage on el camino, arriving straight from the atlanta airport. sitting in the tub was with the view of the cornfield and tree line was a much-anticipated delight!

Stayed a few nights","Awesome hosts, excellent location, quiet, secluded. There's enough close to keep you ""busy"" during the day. But as the hosts says, it's best just to disconnect and relax. Go fill up some water bottles at the springs, eat at the local Linde Marie's, maybe float the river if it's warm enough.
Word of caution, there isn't enough hot water for BOTH tubs on the porch, so enjoy during the summer, but don't plan to enjoy both for a warm tub during the winter. Do, however, plan to take full advantage of this gem of a barn."

Group trip","The Big Red Barn commands attend in a huge field all on its own, upon entry you will know you are in for a unique stay. Sleeps 6 ( I think) upstairs in the loft. The Master bedroom is spacious with a private bath and laundry room which was much needed on our two week trip. The kitchen was well appointed, a little too well as one of my sons on a special diet, but I quickly saw all the condiments and such so it was ok. We used the fire pit (firewood provided) and roasted marshmallows. Had family member visit for a while. We were going to see Cave Spring but it isnt open yet, so we just enjoyed the claw foot tubs, HOT AND COLD water on the deck, and some wine. We cooked all our meals and just relaxed. LOTS of cozy blankets which is hard to come by, I bring my own but nice to have extras. The outside table to et is nice we had lunch and dinner out there. We saw fireflies and heard some coyotes talking back and forth in the field at night when we had our fire, it was kinda scary cause one was pretty close, but kinda fun at the same time. Lots of green grass to play/walk in, and we will definitely come back for a longer visit. Thank you for sharing."

The driveway starts almost right across from the two mailboxes. The space has everything you may need and more. Robin and Petey are such nice hosts. There are so many places to sit and relax. It is a great space for family gatherings or a quiet getaway as a couple. Robin also allowed our senior pets to be with us, which just made each moment there all the more special for us."

(always a nice surprise!) all was very clean, beds were comfortable (with the adult children bunking in the same room like on our early family trips), towels were plentiful, and the deck tubs were a great bonus. this will be our first choice when we return to the rome area for more visits and exploration."

Stayed a few nights","Every year we look for an escape where we can celebrate my husband’s late January birthday. We decided to do something different than our traditional cabin-in-the-mountains getaway. Our search led us to The Red Barn and it surpassed our EVERY expectation! The website pictures are enticing, but they still did not fully capture the property’s actual beauty or the barn’s loveliness with all of the special touches we discovered in every room. Nor do the pictures adequately reflect the spotless cleanliness – so important during this pandemic time. It’s obvious that the owners are focused on keeping their guests not only comfortable, but safe.
Our entire experience was delightful. The property owner Robin has clearly earned her Airbnb “Super-Host” designation. She was wonderfully helpful during the reservation process and the time leading up to our arrival. She checked on us shortly after our arrival and greeted us with a plate of right-out-of-the-oven, gooey-good but healthy brownie-bran bites! They were delicious every morning along with the fabulous coffee we made from the very specially and fully stocked coffee/tea bar!
During our stay we enjoyed… preparing meals in the large kitchen that had everything we could possibly need/want; grilling on the deck; lazing on the super comfortable great room furniture while being warmed by the fire; watching the beyond-description pink morning sun and full moon rises over the trees; puzzling at the table and looking out the windows to see deer grazing in the winter field; our dog waiting for the owner’s precious dog Petey to come to the door every morning so they could play together outside; the quaint Cave Spring downtown and an amazing dinner at Linde Marie’s Steakhouse on the Square; exploring the surrounding areas – our 2 favorites…. the Little River Canyon National Preserve (Fort Payne, AL) with its magnificent falls, and then walking on the Silver Comet Trail.
Of our many, many vacation rentals over the years The Red Barn is our new favorite, and we’d love to experience it in every season! Thank you so much for having us."

Stayed with kids","We stayed here for the christmas long wkend from Miami and we absolutely loved this barn home. Tom and Robin were such great host. Tom helped us out of mud puddle after getting stuck upon arrival.. Peter 🐶was such a sweet boy, my kids adored him.The barn home was PERFECT! It had everything, plenty of pots, towels and extra blankets/quilts. Robin had such the sweetest little touches such as smore kit baskets, coffee cart, pillow sprays. We cant wait to come back and spend more time in the barn. Oh and we had snow flurries which the kids so psyched about, first time seeing ❄ snow. Again thanks so much for everything. SEE YOU SOON!"

Before our arrival and during our stay, Robin sent out messages to see if we need anything. The barn has everything that you possibly need, including several different flavors of coffee. Our kids had a lot of fun at the barn, especially the bon fire right in front of the barn. We were left with the impression that the barn doesn’t have WiFi when we booked it. But it does! My son did the online lesson with no trouble at all. Overall, we had a great two nights stay at this Barn and we highly recommend this unique stay!"

Stayed a few nights","We had a completely delightful time at the Red Barn! It was perfect for our girls' getaway - plenty of room for sleeping, eating, talking, taking walks, going window shopping (and ice-cream eating) in Cave Spring and Rome. We practically lived on the porch, and just thought the tubs on the porch were a hoot. So many little touches - it is very well appointed. We brought food and had amazing meals with the assistance of the grill - never ate out once (except for that ice cream). It's such a peaceful place, and we enjoyed walking the country road and basking in the lovely fall temperatures in the chairs on the porch. Planning to make this a twice-a-year event, for our mental health, you know."

I can't get over how quiet and peaceful it was. I also took my two pups who enjoyed exploring the fields and finding a sunspot on the patio to nap while I soaked in the tub. The kitchen has everything you need to make meals and the coffee station is well stocked with coffee, tea, sugar, creamer, etc.. I did drive through the town square area that is like 3 mins up the road and it is very charming. I didn't feel comfortable eating at a restaurant during these times but maybe next time. I highly recommend this place."

Stayed a few nights","The views from the porch are breathtaking! Our first night we enjoyed some relaxing time in the “hot tubs” while my children chased fireflies in the massive yard. There was plenty of room for my family of 6 plus our Aussie. My kids appreciated the large selection of games and puzzles and each had their own bed (which was nice). The master bed is nice and big and comfy. I wish the floors were better insulated because I could hear every move, giggle and step my kids took above us, but I knew it was a loft before hand, so I didn’t expect to not be able to hear them. There is only one bathroom, two would have been more convenient for such a large family and there is plenty of space for one off of the master bedroom but again, I knew that before I reserved it. Robin is an exceptional hostess, we were coming up for my husbands birthday/ annual family white water rafting trip. She offer to go pick up his cake for a local bakery (the she also recommended) and even purchased some balloons and had them waiting on the counter for us when we arrived. She is incredibly quick to respond and very accommodating. We loved this little slice of heaven, the sunset was so beautiful over the mountains in the distance. If I ever find myself in GA again on vacation we will be booking the Barn."

-The host was nice and very responsive.
-Peaceful, private, scenic location.
-The only thing we didn't love were the entrances to the cabin, they were both very steep and made it a bit difficult to unload/load belongings."

The cabin itself is fabulous! Clean and modern and yet rustic somehow! We were provided the basic amenities. The trees surrounding the cabin, the swing in the front porch perfect for a nice cup of coffee or tea. Rome is about 20 minutes away. Check in and check out were seamless. I highly recommend this place!!

We enjoyed coffee on the porch in the mornings and watching deer eat their breakfast on the lawn. Inside is completely modern and updated with lovely furnishings and everything you could possibly need. The cabin is a short ride (less than 5 min.) to Cave Spring, but you feel completely secluded in the wooded environment. My only regret is that we didnt' get a chance to have a fire in the fire pit (just didn't have time!) Melissa is responsive and check in was easy. We didn't need anything during our stay but Melissa sent messages to ensure we had everything we needed. I wish I could give 10 stars!"

We live in the area and the venue was just minutes away so it was perfect! I would highly recommend this house to anyone who is looking to rent an Airbnb in Rockmart! I literally would love to go to just sleep on the comfortable beds for just a a little getaway! The host even provided cokes, waters, and juice which I thought was going above and beyond! Cannot say enough wonderful things about this house and the amazing host! She even allowed us to have a little extra time to checkout since the bride and groom stayed on night two!

Many places to eat right around the corner and walking for exercise or fresh air is an easy thing here. Owner was responsive and easy to deal with and we enjoyed our stay.

Stayed with kids","We were visiting family in Rome and needed a larger place to stay. This mobile home provided 4 bedrooms/2 baths with a living and eating area spacious enough to accommodate our group of 7. Rome was an easy 20 minute drive.
The home was very clean and comfortable. The beds were comfortable, but with high mattresses. This made it a little difficult for the older and younger ones to get in and out of bed, but they managed.
We had plenty of clean towels, pillows, and blankets for our group. We had what was needed in the kitchen for a quick breakfast before heading out the door. There was plenty of parking for our two cars with enough room for a few more.
Our host was very responsive. We had clear and simple check-in and check-out instructions with a very generous cancellation policy, if needed. He was very quick to respond, when help was needed for the tv.
The neighborhood had some houses that were a little unkempt but overall was still very quiet and we felt very safe."

The house suited our needs! I really appreciated how stocked the house was and the amenities. We were able to do everything we needed to over the week without really needing anything. I really appreciated that!
The host was both proactive and responsive, which was fantastic!
It was only about 15 minutes from your Kroger, Walmart etc. They actually have these little festivals just 5 minutes up the road.

Stayed a few nights","Christina’s guest house was perfect for our weekend getaway.
It’s a guesthouse, but it’s very private. The guest house has a beautiful wall of windows/glass door that faces the private tennis court. You’ve got your own private driveway as well.
The house was very clean & welcoming! Christine even placed a couple fresh flowers as a nice touch!
Christine was very quick to respond to any questions. Check-in & check-out were both very simple.
We were about 10+ mins away from downtown Rome.
We’d love to come back for another visit & we will be recommending Christine’s place to family/friends! Everything was perfect!"

Stayed a few nights","From the moment we arrived, it was clear that this Airbnb was something special. Nestled in a serene location, the property boasted modernity and comfort at every turn. The house itself was nothing short of impeccable - it felt like we were the first guests to ever step inside, with every corner of the space sparkling clean and every amenity functioning perfectly.
But what truly set this experience apart was the stunning tennis court. It was an absolute dream for any tennis player!
However, the crown jewel of our stay was the hospitality shown by our hosts, James and Christina. They didn’t just provide us with a place to stay; they made us feel like part of their family. Their warmth and kindness were unparalleled, and they went above and beyond to ensure we had a great stay. This place is a rare gem that we cannot recommend highly enough."

Stayed with a pet","This is one of my top favorite places I have ever stayed at! The house is very unique and the location on the creek is absolutely beautiful. The house felt clean and climate controlled. We spent most of our time hanging out on the balconies and our dogs loved exploring the creek. Neighbors are just far enough away that it still feels remote and private. The hot tub felt amazing after I did two rounds of a 4.5 mile canine obstacle race!! We would absolutely stay here again. Pressure hose availability was a bonus, too!! This place is a VIBE."

The place was about the cleanest AirB&B we’ve ever stayed in and the setting was tranquil and peaceful. It was a perfect place for us as we were biking the Ladiga and Comet trails and their property was right on the trail. They also were kind enough to let us leave our car there for a few days while we bike packed to the end of the comet trail and back. We would highly recommend and would def rent again if we were in the area!

The house sits right beside the creek surrounded by beautiful trees. Words can't describe how serene and relaxing it was here. The house was quaint with just enough space for 3 adults, 1 child and 2 dogs. The hosts were very thoughtful with all the special touches throughout the house, including the s'mores. Thank you for a memorable visit! We loved playing in the creek during the day, then soaking in the hot tub under the stars at night!"

Stayed with a pet",Wow. This was an amazing location. Me and my significant other were celebrating our 9th anniversary and this place hit the ball out of the park. We brought our dog and he had soooo much fun. The hosts were extremely accommodating when it came to little things they already had in place. We were so worried about forgetting to bring something and they almost had everything we would’ve needed. Extremely responsive as well. The fire pit is a marvel in itself. There is tons of foliage and dead trees around to build an awesome fire. The hot tub was absolutely perfect for the two of us. I wake up early and I saw herds of deer running around. The pictures really did not do the location justice. It really is breathtaking. I couldn’t think of a negative thing if I wanted to. An absolutely amazing place for a private couples retreat. Would absolutely book this location again.

Stayed with a pet","We had an amazing 4 nights at the Tree House! Matthew and Melanie were excellent hosts. They were very communicative both before and during our stay, and we appreciated the little extras they provided like smores and firewood!
The house is rustic-chic with tons of character and unique touches. The property is very private and, although you can see a couple of neighboring houses, there is enough distance so that you will feel isolated in the woods. We loved sitting in the hot tub and listening to the creek and the sounds of nature. If you plan to prepare meals on-site (there are very few restaurants in the area) be sure to bring cooking oil/salt and pepper etc. There isn't much in town, but you'll be able to find any necessities you may have forgotten. There are some amazing trails in the area, including one at the bottom of the driveway, and don't miss the gorge at Noccalula Falls in Gadsden where you can go all the way behind the falls! Overall a great trip, thanks!"

Pets allowed and some body of water were a our only “musts.” Obviously, the dog(s) situation limited things a lot so we were grateful to run across Joy Cove.
What an amazing little gem too! Jody, Ken and Traci have created such a unique and peaceful oasis. The place was super clean and stocked with everything we needed and they were such a sweet and gracious family. Everywhere we turned we found a surprise in art or nature. The outdoor shower was an added bonus. We rode bikes, explored the water, visited Rome and Cave Spring and got plenary of R & R. We could not have been happier! Highly recommend and we will be back very soon for another stay!!!"

Stayed a few nights","If you are searching for peace & solitude you definitely can find it here. If you are looking for THE xtras of a great Airbnb it is also here. They thought of everything down to the details of a multi cell charger, a tea bar & a snack jar filled with breakfast bars & snacks among coffee & spices. The kitchen was stocked with everything needed if you want to grill or cook inside. The cabinet in the bathroom was stocked with every necessity you could think of. The beds were so comfy & sheets were of great quality. It was decorated with so much detail & it really went well with the theme.
My favorite was the outside shower. I used it while it was pouring rain 🌧 & it was perfect.
The first day we arrived it was a beautiful day no rain but knew it was coming. The host greeted me & showed me around. Had chairs awaiting down by the lake so we could watch the sunset & the outside fire chimney was ready to be lit 🔥 when time came. A brand new grill was provided stocked with all the utensils 🍴 needed. We were offered a workshop experience & can’t wait til next time will definitely make time for that. The surrounding are beautiful with plants & flowers. The cove was a perfect place for privacy. Can’t wait to kayak next time.
There is nothing I can say bad about this listing & I’ve stayed in plenty of Airbnbs. This one is a 10+. Thank you both for providing everything & more. God Bless you & yours."
