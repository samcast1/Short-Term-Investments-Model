Stayed a few nights","Spacious, clean and cozy with all the essentials to make breakfast (kitchenette) and air conditioning (a little noisy). Very quiet environment, a small haven of peace that looks like a cabin. We enjoyed our 2 nights at Dave and Suzanne's who guided us well in messages but we regret not having met them... The accommodation is well placed if you want to go to Lafayette and Cajun country."

Stayed with a pet","The photos don’t capture how charming it is! Cosy room, comfy bed. Lots of locally produced art on the walls. The host’s guidebook pointed us to Bayou Teche Brewing, where on a Sunday afternoon there was live music, locals hanging out, and good pizza and beer. We were so happy that they welcomed our dog, and we appreciated the doggie bowls and extra towels and mats provided for him. Although we didn’t get to meet Dave in person, he responded to all our messages before and after our stay. Suzanne was also welcoming and gave us good tips. Their very curious cat crept into our car as we were packing up; be careful or you might have a stowaway! 🙂Very highly recommended."

Stayed one night",Dave and Suzanne’s house is so dreamy we immediately booked to return after our weekend in New Orleans. The tree house is beautifully constructed by Dave the decor is beautiful the location is great and Dave was incredibly lovely offering us local recommendations. Suzanne also generously did a load of our washing which was much needed after a few weeks on the road! Wish we could stay longer and can’t wait to return in a few days!

Stayed a few nights",David and Suzanne are tremendous hosts and are very friendly. Their home is in the beautiful countryside of South Louisiana. I would highly recommend this property for those passing through for the night or for an extended stay. The town of Sunset is centrally located to many of the small towns of Acadiana and the city of Lafayette.

Stayed with a pet","Very easy going hosts. The best part of the house was definitely the backyard. Feels like a fairytale, especially at night with all the lights lit up. The inside is pretty accurate to the pictures. David also allowed us early check in, which was awesome! My only gripe I would say would be a rule about not leaving our pet alone inside the house for longer periods of time.. it needs to be written on the listing and not sent in a message one day before arrival. Other than that communication issue, yes I highly recommend staying here. Take advantage of the beautiful backyard!"

Coffee, frig , microwave.. fluffy towels . Great restaurant recommendation.. close to interstate for easy start the next morning . Just about perfect!

Stayed with a pet","For a first time airbnb experience, my stay went above expectations. David was very flexible with checkin and the whole process made it easy to settle in. I only had difficulty finding my way to parking, but that is not at David’s fault as I did check in a little late and it was a bit too dark to see. The stay over the one night we were there was peaceful and quiet and had no problem resting. The place was clean and very comfortable, we felt right at home. Check out process was just as easy as checking in and instructions were very clear."

Stayed a few nights","David and his family have a beautiful home. I stayed here for 3 nights and 2 full days just to spend some time in a personal retreat, and it was the perfect hidden cozy spot to do just that. I spent the majority of my time in the room and outside on the little balcony. It’s comfy and cozy and I enjoyed being in the space.
I did not personally meet David, but he gave me clear directions and instructions for checkin/checkout from the very beginning and was immediately responsive to messages. I had no problems with my stay.
Would recommend for any single person or couple looking for a day or two to just rest and relax!
PS: There’s a lovely coffee shop across the way in Grand Coteau called Hive Market that I would absolutely recommend! Only about 7 minutes from David’s place."

Stayed one night","The tree room was adorable! The stay was almost perfection!
Land was gorgeous, record player was such a quaint and fun touch, and we loved the kitty cats!
David was an absolute delight. Available to chit chat casually or whenever needed, but also keeps to himself just the perfect amount. I overall felt very at home! My only critique, or suggestion, is that this is the kind of stay best suited for people with a bit of a stricter schedule for the duration of their bnb stay. Strictly enforced quiet hours for half the day, 10 PM-9AM, David’s wife unlocking and opening the door at 7 AM, 4 hours before check out, because she mistakenly thought we had left ? even though we had expressed nothing of the sort and our car was still fully out in the open and parked in her driveway as it had been all along. My fiancé and I are very generally easy going, kind, and respectful guests, albeit we can get a tad lax sometimes. I feel this bnb would be suited for folks that sleep early & value structure."

The bed was super comfortable, the bathroom was very clean, and the a/c was just what we needed after a hot day. Met Dave as we were coming in, very nice and helpful! We were coming in at dark and they left outdoor lights on to make it easier for us to see, they also have lights wrapped around the tree which was really cute. They have a nice little lit up sign at the end of their driveway so you know exactly where to turn. High recommend this stay!"

The tree limb outside the door really needs to be lit up or marked better so people don't hit their heads.
there is no bulb in the porch light.
the towles could have been alot fresher.
the spout on the coffee pot is broken (glass). coffee and wat6goes everywhere."

This is how airbnb is meant to be. The owners were kind and after i made a mistake booking we could quickly resolve it by fast communication. I also enjoyed the location if the house. It was quite, but there are multiple towns close. The room was bigger then i thought it would be, with a big bathroom as well. The owners thought of everything so everything you would neat is there.

Stayed one night","Mr. & Mrs. David are one of the few wonderful hosts that we have ever come across.
It has been a great experience at ""Bon Temps Tree Room"" that we will cherish throughout our life. To be precise, there are many things about this house that we absolutely loved during our stay: the Greenery, little amusing elements in the garden, interior design, the hosts themselves, and the overall ambiance inside & outside the house. It is indeed a 5-Star experience.
Every part of the house is photo-genic and clean. We would definitely recommend people choose this ""Tree House"" over many other similar accommodations, given that the overall experience matters a lot.
Thanks & Regards,
Srinu & Anu"

Stayed a few nights","Wow! Where do I even start! I guess I’ll start by saying the pictures DO NOT do this place justice! Pulling up and seeing the house at first glance for the first time set back from the road with all these absolutely breathtaking oak trees is a site to behold…. As I pulled into the gravel driveway, I was greeted by an oversized and great outdoor entertaining area that was beautifully lit with the hanging patio lights (which is adjustable by remote) ❤️ The host took the time to put those on as he knew I would be coming in a dusk. Heck I’m was extremely smooth and he had the key waiting for me to easily get in and enjoy the home, relax and rest.. as he checked in I asked about the fireplaces and he quickly came over to show me how to work each fireplace, how to work the Apple TV and also shared the amazing historical memories and genealogy of all the generations before him which I really enjoyed… once he left I didn’t leave the red room in front of the fireplace for quite some time until my food arrived which I picked up from the front porch :) I quickly realized I somehow locked myself out of the house and the host quickly came by to let me back in the house and also moved the chaise lounge in front of the fireplace so that I was extra comfy! Between the The master bedroom and the study… I did open that door and keep open to allow for easy passage of the two and so that I can get to the master bathroom without having to go out into the foyer/hallway area… just a small suggestion for anyone who maybe staying in the future ;-) there is pretty much every single thing you need in order to eat and cook and even grill… all you need are the things you are cooking but utensils, seasonings kitchen gadgets etc… there is no need! Oh speaking of everything you need! When the host came to set up the fireplaces he graciously brought over some red wine which me and my gf’s will be enjoying once they arrive tomorrow! Every room here has its own theme… it’s own story… I constantly get up at times and explore the house and find new things each time… I still have not figured out where the chaise lounge came from as I never did find a space amongst all the furniture of where it could have possibly came from? Lol… it is tastefully decorated and very homey… I have not felt this relaxed in such a while! I was able to read, pray, reflect, meditate, be still, sleep and rest for the first couple of days on my own… then have some amazing quality time with my husband and kids as they came up on evening 2 for a night and we all enjoyed our special time together, they left earlier today as I write this and get to have quiet time again…. Then tomorrow I have some of my closest friends joining me until Thursday morning for our ladies retreat/staycation! I say all that to say this home is diverse and fitting for any and all uses whether it’s alone…. With family…. As a romantic getaways… a group of friends… or even a wedding… it’s absolutely perfect for any situation and I look forward to continuing my stay here and already can’t wait to return and make this quick and close by RETREAT SPOT a recurring thing and a place to visit and recharge! Huge shout out and thanks to the hosts again for allowing me to stay!"

Stayed a few nights","Jonathan's house is undoubtedly an unusual place to stay. The decoration is remarkable. The impression of space is omnipresent, and the place is very quiet. We are immersed in a certain glorious past.
It is properly located to shine around Lafayette (30 minutes away)
The beds were however a little small for two people and unfortunately everyone was unable to sleep properly. It took us a first day to tame the building (electricity, sanitary facilities), some facilities are indeed ""period"" but then we quickly got used to it. The air conditioning and the kitchen are nickels.
Jonathan is unfailing in responsiveness.
In any case, it will remain a remarkable stopover on our journey that led us through Texas and Louisiana."

Group trip","I was fortunate enough to come across Jonathan's place, during a search for a place to stay for an upcoming trip to Lafayette, to celebrate my mother-in-laws 80th birthday. When I found Bellevue Manor, in near by Opelousas, the search was over, I had found the perfect place! With six adults and three teenage children, we slept very comfortably, and had an amazing historical backdrop for an extended family gathering in honor of her birthday. We enjoyed every moment of our stay, and made some wonderful family memories. It was really the perfect accommodations for a family celebration. Jonathan went above and beyond to help everything run smoothly, and we loved the stories of his family, and the history of the house, as well as the area. He has done an amazing job of maintaining the history of his family and their home, and we were privileged to have him share some of it with us. We highly recommend a visit to Bellevue Manor."

As well when we had to look under and inside the living room couch to look for our children’s toys we found some unexpected object (tissues, candy,...). This is why we gave only 2 stars for cleanliness.

Stayed a few nights","Bellevue Manor is an excellent accommodation, conveniently located for exploring Cajun country, and the opportunity to actually live in the manor is, in and of itself, a truly unique, interesting and enjoyable experience. Opelousas is centrally located for a variety of Cajun interests, including Fred's Lounge (Mamou), which is about as ""down home"" an experience as one can hope for; the Cajun hall of fame (Eunice); and many other interesting spots, depending upon one's interest. After spending a week in New Orleans, our stay at Bellevue Manor was like actually living out some of the history we had learned about. The Manor is large, comfortable, full of antiques and period furniture, along with all the comforts of home. Jonathan was very helpful and responsive throughout our period of searching, selecting and experiencing Bellevue Manor. Treat yourself to the incredible experience we had."

The unique house was filled with beautiful antiques and the front yard is wonderful. My large family was able to all stay together which we couldn’t have done in a hotel. Jonathan made us feel very welcomed and was available day or night if we needed anything.

As a wedding venue, choosing Bellevue Manor is great for a bride who wants to have total control, be very hands on, and stick to a set budget. I was able to choose my own vendors and decorate how I wanted because there were not set alcohol/meal rules or added on fees like other venues. The house is great for a rehearsal dinner, catered buffet, ceremony, wedding reception, wedding photos, bridal party, and honeymoon suite.

The property accommodated our wedding with 100 guests perfectly. We used the carport for crafting/sorting decorations one night and then hosted a 30 person rehearsal dinner the next. For the wedding, we had our ceremony under the oak tree and then our reception in the front yard, which was enough space for 12 tables, dancing, and a bar. The carport was used for a buffet and our caterer had easy access to the kitchen. The front porch served as a space for the cake table on one side and the DJ on the other. The bridal party was able to get ready upstairs before the wedding. One of the gated fields was used for parking and the semi-circle driveway was very convenient. We also created a honeymoon suite by closing off a few doors, which allowed for a connecting bedroom, living area, and bathroom. There are very large closets inside the house that we used to store all of our suitcases and miscellaneous stuff so that our guest could tour an uncluttered house during reception.The bridal party proceeded out through the front doors and down the sidewalk to the ceremony. The property is large enough that we were able to take bridal party photos while being separated from our guests.

Jonathan was there to help out with whatever we needed, allowed to use things around the house to decorate with, and move things around for the wedding. Jonathan provided us with tiki torches, paper tree lanterns, extra toilet paper, 2 rectangular folding tables, and extra trash bags. He treated the grounds for mosquitoes, prepped the yard, gave us great set up ideas, rented our table cloths, and gave us a table/chair rental company suggestion, let us arrive early, let us leave late, and let us do a walkthrough. I was very hands on with my wedding and brought my own signs, antique decorations, and flowers.

Bellevue Manor was the perfect venue for my wedding to make it stress-free and enjoyable. I highly recommend it."

Stayed a few nights","When we were looking for a place to stay in Opelousas for a little visit with friends and relatives in the area we just lucked upon this place. I don't know that I can adequately describe how satisfied we all were with our stay! The house itself is straight out of a history book, and you just couldn't help but feel like you'd somehow slipped back in time just by staying there. Jonathan was a terrific host who went out of his way to make us feel welcome. Everything was there that we needed to make this our ""home away from home"" during our stay, and we instantly felt comfortable there. I don't take making a recommendation lightly, but I can honestly say that this would be the perfect base of operations for any family visit to the heart of Cajun country! Whether you plan to stay around Opelousas, or travel to Lafayette and other surrounding communities like we did, this piece of local history is an absolute gem!"

Stayed about a week",This home is awesome! Every room is its own museum. The grounds are great for lazy days just hanging out on the porch or the huge carport/outside living area! We stayed 10 days and could of stayed 10 more. 2 pianos and a great tub to bubble bath in! Frank's poboys 1/2 a block away for great food and cocktails. 5 minutes to major highway south to Lafayette or east to Baton Rouge. We were here on a work trip so each guy had their own bedroom. Living room sat 8 comfortable for movie night. Huge comfy benches to lounge on throughout. Central air was being installed when we left but the window units kept us cool just fine. Huge shade tree in front yard. Place is just awesome. Old world charm.

Jonathan welcomed us and gave us a tour, complete with history of the house and the family, whose pictures are throughout. He even went out and bought a baby gate when I expressed concern about keeping the children off the stairs. Really enjoyable things to do nearby while we were there: Chicot State Park, the Orphan Train Museum, a state fair in Lafayette, and Evangeline Downs racetrack, and berry picking farms (a little further away)."

Stayed a few nights","My extended family and I came to Lafayette for a wedding and wanted to stay in a home together. We knew from the photos that Bellevue Manor was going to be special but it exceeded our expectations in almost every way. Jonathan was a charming and colorful host and made us feel so welcome. He was always available to us, if needed. Each room was like a masterpiece with beautiful antiques and decorated with a wonderful sense to detail, highlighting it's rich family heritage. As if the house itself wasn't enough of a showcase, the huge live oak in the front yard was a show stopper! It was absolutely spectacular to behold. Opelousas was convenient to all our wedding events in and around Lafayette and it was a quick and easy access to Interstate 49 from the house. The home is so unique and made our family time extra special. We loved sitting on the porch together and enjoying meals around the big round table in the dining room or outside under the breezeway off the kitchen. I can wholeheartedly recommend Bellevue Manor for a one of a kind experience."

Stayed a few nights","The Listing was totally accurate, Jonathan was super communicative and easy going. My brother left his sunglasses and Jonathan, without us even asking, shipped them to us!

We were looking for a beautiful space to hang out with friends, cook a lot and just chill for the weekend and this place hit all of those resoundingly! The house has numerous ""hang"" spaces, including an awesome porch and side patio, along with indoor rooms that are great for group hang too. We managed to do quite a few things in Opelousas, including walking to Mama's fried chicken (which we ate all weekend) and Frank's bar for drinks and pool. The house is within walking distance of other cafes, too, and Billy and Ray's boudin store (DELICIOUS) and the downtown Opelousas village and Orphan Train museum.

Lafayette and Whiskey River Landing, where we saw Geno Delafose, are a short drive away.

We were a group of 9 and were super-comfortable. I could definitely see this space for a beautiful party as well."

The ‘Little Teche Bayou Bungalow’ was exactly as it presented itself. A cute little well cared for home with a beautiful backdrop, patio and deck. The pricing was fair and we were able to bring our dog along for the stay. I think he had just as much fun as we did. The home was so clean, comfortable and peaceful.. just what we were looking for in our quick getaway. Melissa is truly a ‘Super Host’ she added a lot of personal touches that really made our stay special.

Picking pecans was a highlight of our trip. We didn’t need to find anything to do because all the fun was at this Airbnb. Thanks, Melissa we will be back!"

Stayed a few nights","This little house is absolutely adorable, and incredibly clean! It’s nestled into a beautiful setting along a little bayou with beautiful trees. It was a perfect spot for us to stay when visiting our family, so much better than a hotel. The house has so many sweet and thoughtful touches. All the amenities you can think of are covered, and the kitchen has all the pots, dishes, etc. to make a meal there if you want. The screened in porch is amazing, and it was lovely to drink coffee on each morning. Beyond the home being perfect and comfortable to stay at, I must add that the couple who owns this house are amazing humans. We had an incident where our pet bird got out, and they were there for us to help in our time of distress. They went above and beyond, and frankly we are touched and moved by their kindness to be with us for hours helping us to stay hydrated, etc. as we worked to get our bird back. I’m happy to say that the ending of the story was a good one, and we have our Tweedy bird safely at home, but just know if you book this house for your stay in the area, beyond it being clean and lovely, you are supporting amazing people. We will sing their praises forever."

Stayed a few nights","First off, communication with Melissa was great. She's very kind and quick to respond and goes above and beyond with her communication. I travel around Louisiana a lot and have stayed in many small cabins/cottages around the state and this one is my new definite favorite. It's located down a quiet road with neighbors all spread fairly apart (yet VERY convenient to get to town). I loved that privacy. You really feel secluded with a lovely pasture across from the front of the house and a really cool ""forest-type"" area in the back (where I rode a dirt bike they have available through the trees and the mud and up and down the little hills...definitely a lot of fun). There is a beautiful deck with a gas grill that's overlooks a sloped hill in front of a creek. There is also a screened indoor porch (with a ceiling fan to keep it very tolerable for sitting outside; even in the late June heat). The view from the porch is the same as from the deck and I stayed outside listening to music and grilling and enjoying the view for hours. The house itself was sparkling clean and had a cute design. Although it's not a huge cottage, it feels very spacious due to an open design and it's certainly not what I would call a small house. There is a spacious kitchen with a gas stove and lots of pots and pans and bowls and plates and utensils. It was exactly like being in your own kitchen. There are two bedrooms; so the cabin is perfect for two friends, two couples, parents and two small children or one older child or a solo traveler like myself. Upon arrival, I saw some blueberry muffins that had been left for me along with some personalized notes welcoming me. They also left me fresh vegetables that had just been picked and they told me to enjoy some of the tiny sweet tomatoes growing from a plant on their deck. They also left me homemade granola and yogurt in the refrigerator to enjoy for breakfast.
Please don't let the fact that there is no central air deter you. There are three powerful window units and several ceiling fans that keep the cool air flowing. It was very hot outside when I was there but inside was more than comfortable. Even though there is no cable TV, the stations they do get are crystal clear and there are at least a dozen of them. And even though there is no WIFI, I was able to get internet perfectly on my phone using my own data. I even paired my phone with my iPad and streamed some movies while I relaxed on the porch. This is the perfect place to just settle back and relax and enjoy a beautiful atmosphere with great hospitality from caring hosts. I will definitely be returning again!"

This was perfect! It was quiet, secluded, and soothing and we got to take several naps! Everything was clean. The kitchen was well stocked with cooking necessities. The weather was surprisingly nice for June so we were able to hang out on the screen porch and listen to the rain.
Melissa was easy to communicate with and she had prepared some much appreciated goodies for our stay. We look forward to staying here again!"

The house is very stylish, clean, and feels homey. The bed is very comfortable, and it's such a peaceful setting to rest. Melissa's hospitality and attention to the guests needs is above and beyond. She took the care to make my trip extra special, and the wonderful treats were nice. I highly recommend this place. You will love it and want to return, just like I do!"

I did make a mistake initially in booking our stay a day earlier than supposed to and leaving too soon. When going right back in within minutes to correct the date, surprised me that the price had increased (my fault though). The home was very cute and accommodating (not having to keep up with a key, having wi-fi, and very soft rugs were pluses). Having more than one bathroom would be helpful, but overall, it was great!

The description of the place on Airbnb was a perfect fit for reality, and we'd actually say the reality was even better. The photos couldn't quite capture the beauty and serenity we experienced.
We would book with Larry and Becky without hesitation again. Their place offers not only a comfortable space, but also access to some great local sights. A thoroughly positive experience that we hope we can repeat"

The bathroom was well stocked, especially for anything a guest might have accidentally forgotten to pack. The living and bedroom areas were clean, roomy, and comfortable.
Both hosts were friendly and made us feel at home. Their adult son accommodated us with a short tour of their vegetable gardens, their animals, and explained their efforts to restore the natural ecosystem to their land.

And don’t get me started on the claw foot cast iron tub. I spent way too much time in there! The rocking chairs out front are the perfect place to drink your coffee in the morning. The bed is comfortable, the kitchen is stocked with any supplies you might need, and the bathroom is the size of my living room. There is a binder on the counter with tons of recommendations for local restaurants and coffee shops. I will always stay here on my trips to Lafayette as long as it’s available!"

Stayed a few nights",This cottage was exactly as the pictures and description showed. There was a very well laid out book for places to eat and things to do. We didn't do anything local because I had picked this location as being halfway between New Orleans and Houston. Very warm and inviting. You could tell that it was set up like they would want it if they were traveling. Great attention to detail. Another reason I chose it was for the big tub. My girlfriend spent a couple of hours in it relaxing and drinking wine. Can't speak highly enough of the cottage or the hosts. Great vacation for us. Thanks for helping to make that happen.

The rain on the tin roof was so relaxing. The bed is extremely comfortable and linens were fresh and clean. The location is just enough out of town to relax and have peace but a very close drive if you want restaurants, shopping, or other activities. It is truly the perfect spot and it is hard to leave. Rena wad such a blessing to talk to. The hospitality of all of them as a team was wonderfu. They are sure to have everything you need whether you want to stay at the house or venture to the city. For the price, location, and the amenities, it is hard to find a better place. I will be back again, I'm sure of it."

Stayed a few nights","We cannot say enough wonderful things about this lovely little cabin! We were very busy at Lafayette's Festival international, or we'd have liked to have seen our hosts. We did, however, meet Matthew's mother Rina, who was delightful, and confirmed many of the restaurant suggestions that Amber had written in the guest instruction book. This book was really helpful in scoping out restaurants and places of interest, but there also was a great book about all of the sights in the area. The cabin itself is immaculate, huge, easy to work in (since we had to do a little online work), and the bathtub...OMG! Heaven!
We first stayed in this cabin in 2018 and loved it! Then Covid hit... We returned in 2022, but foolishly decided to stay closer to the Festival. WRONG CHOICE! This cabin is only 7 mins. to town and SO WORTH IT! We've decided to return here every year, if our hosts will have us. Thanks, y'all! You're the best!!!"

Stayed a few nights","The Cajun Cottage was perfect for our needs--just what we hoped. Amber's place was just like the photos. We were pleased from the moment we drove up. Mrs. Rena, Matthew's mom, lives next door and greeted us from her beautiful yard. She was very welcoming, accomodating, and kind. We loved the home and new it had some history. Per our request, Mrs. Rena showed us some before and after photos which only make you appreciate the charm even more. The home is small but not, if that makes sense. Lovely large bathroom, kitchen with everything you need, nice size living room, beautiful bedroom...and do NOT miss the front porch in the morning and evening. We have already recommended this cottage to others, and we will definitely be returning. Thank you for a wonderful stay during a bitter-sweet time for us."

Bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom was large, double vanity, which is nice, and very modern. However, you must try a soak in the eagle claw tub! Loved the gift of satsumas and kumquats. The food in that area is typical of our Cajun heritage, and you will enjoy. Best checkouts for seafood are The Crawfish House in Opelousas, and the Cajun Table in Lafayette. Don's on Johnston St Lafayette is also a must try. Thank you to our hosts, and sorry we could not visit the Taxidermy, just ran out of time."

The cottage is pretty, very clean, and very, very comfortable. Everything I needed was provided. There was not one bug in sight nor evidence of any bugs at all. I felt safe the entire time. The bed was extremely comfortable to me and the linens were nice and appropriate. Although the cottage was new to me, I felt as though I was home.
There is a little book on the table near the front door where the history of the home is recorded in word and photos and showed the transformation from the owner's grandparents' home into the pretty little jewel it is today.
I felt that the price was reasonable and affordable. The location was good. It was near the interstate so it was easy to get to, but it still felt like country. There are plenty of restaurants nearby as well as a Walmart.
This really was a perfect place to stay and encourage you to book it!"

We loved the back patio for sipping coffee for a slow morning, enjoyed cooking a simple dinner in the well appointed kitchen, and cozied up in the living room to play some music one evening. The place was very clean, had all the bathroom toiletries we needed, and created a restful environment that we truly enjoyed!"

The amazing sunsets across the field from the home on the front porch and 2. Being visited by the neighbors chickens.. (We even went and bought feed so I could feed them in the mornings) We stayed just 3 nights and was there on business so can't comment much on things to do or places to eat. If however you are looking for a place to get some peace and quiet I would highly recommend Matthew's and Amber's house.

I also recommend flipping through the book in the living room detailing the amazing transformation the house went through.
All in all, this is a perfect home for those looking for an authentic Cajun experience in the heart of Acadiana!"

It's an incredible home with brilliantly eclectic decor, surrounded by trees and flowers and birds. Jim and Christy were lovely hosts and it was good to get suggestions for things to do from them, as well as just to hang out and talk with them.
We loved the surrounding area too. There are loads of great food places a short drive away - Lee's Cajun Kitchen was an unexpected gem - and it's only ten mins to Don's Drive-thru Daiquiris. By day we explored the LARC Acadian Village and played mini golf, and kayaking through the swamps on Lake Martin was the single best thing on my trip. Next time we'll try the live music and Jim and Christy know the scene well."

Stayed a few nights","A folk art lovers dream, this place is amazing, and Jim and Christy are the best hosts ever!! They greeted us warmly, took us on a complete tour of their complex, which is a series of fabulous art and music inspired spaces. We enjoyed a musical evening of Cajun dancing, storytelling and mingling with local artists. The beds were so comfortable, complete with extra quilts for the morning chill. We awoke to the sounds of birds chirping, a gentle breeze blowing through the pecan trees and such a sense of peace! Such a unique place that can't be fully described or shown by the photos on the website! Folk art everywhere you look with everything you need to relax after a day of sight-seeing, night of dancing or lovely dinner prepared in their kitchen. Can't recommend enough!"

Both the Barn and the tower are filled with amazing art and memorabilia and so pleasing to look at. The grounds are stunning and you are not only free to walk them but encouraged to. The beds are incredibly comfortable and have everything you need it in place to cook a meal. Just a gem of a retreat that so much time and love has been put into. Jim & Christy always greet you with a smile and kind words. We will always return and I recommend this place to anyone!

Stayed a few nights","We had a magical stay at the Folk Art Barn. Jim and Christy have created a wonderful and creative space to enjoy. Such a unique place - a quirky, funky, interesting Aladdin's Cave of wonderment.
Jim and Christy offer such warm and gracious hospitality and give advice and guidance as to how to make the best of your time there.
There is so much to do in the area but if you have time to sit and just relax, you will see hummingbirds and other birds. . It is a great place to just chill and be still.
We were lucky enough to be there for the Black Pot Festival and enjoyed so much great music, dancing and cajun/creole culture.
We would highly recommend and would love to come back - our stay there will be a highlight of our trip to Louisiana."

Everyone loved the space, and it was a comfortable and homey spot to use as our base of operations while visiting the area. When you visit, you feel like you're transported to your grandma's kitchen and feel right at home. Jim and Christy stopped by to say hi and introduced themselves to my friends. They are kind-hearted, generous folks who are involved in all kinds of cool community music and art projects. On our final morning there, we cooked a birthday brunch for my friend before we left the area. The kitchen is functional and fully stocked with all the cooking items you need We ate outside and it was a beautiful spring day--a lovely way to wrap up our weekend trip!"

If you are looking for a place to stay to spend some time roaming around South Louisiana, you could not do better than this. We stayed in the ""barn,"" which is really like a whole house. Two bedrooms at opposite ends with multiple beds; full kitchen, bath and a half washer and dryer, etc. The creature comforts are sparse - no television and slow internet speeds - and it is rustic but that is more than outweighed by the character of the place and the delightful people who run it"

It's also conveniently located to Lafayette, Opelousas and Eunice. The closest little town, Sunset is picturesque and interesting. One member of our party had some allergies, but that's kind of par for the course in a cabin like this - worth knowing, but shouldn't dissuade you from staying here! We will definitely stay again."

Stayed a few nights","I am a frequent traveler and have been an Airbnb user basically since the company launched and this is hands down the most lovely Airbnb experience we've ever had, especially now, in an era where most vacation rentals are cookie-cutter and Ikea-banal. Not only was the Folk Art Barn a great value, it offered all the amenities we could have wanted — it was even cooler than the photos. Hosts Jim and Christy are true hosts in the sense Airbnb originally intended at its founding and that is so, so rare now. They gave us all the space and privacy while at the same time being attentive and welcoming, with great advice about local happenings and a great tour on arrival of all the amazing things they've done with their property. (We stayed during COVID and they took all the right steps to make sure our stay was safe, too.) The space was super comfortable, with thoughtful touches that anticipated every need - from a jar of local coffee grounds to shelves of interesting books to a notepad to write down game scores on the well-stocked game shelf. The way they've done it up is really special, full of plants and great vintage pieces and artwork by local artists. If you are looking to stay somewhere that is full of artistry and gives you a real sense of place, can't recommend this highly enough."

It took 10 hours of running the space heaters on full to warm the place up again. If you notice in the pictures the whole place is heated by space heaters , which is enough to keep it warm as long as they stay on, but when someone turns them off it is very hard to heat back up."

Stayed with kids","I started a new position as Executive Director at a conservation organization in Austin last summer and haven’t taken a day off until this get away. I decided to spend a few days exploring and remembering the countryside of South Louisiana where I grew up.
One of my daughters decided to join me late and Jim and Christy were quick with responses and directions to the home.
The Funky Art Barn is fantastic! Quirky and authentic, with plenty of things to soak in from a nice selection of zydeco CDs to books and guides for things to see in the area, art in unexpected places, a well appointed kitchen, lovely windowed walls, and beautiful garden spaces to enjoy on the 3 or 4 porches that surround the house.
Jim and Christy both welcomed us (distanced and in masks) on arrival, gave us a tour of their grounds and projects (a converted depot that is a music hall in non-Covid times, and a larger gathering space — all with a cool folk-art vibe).
It had easy access to New Orleans, Lafayette, and Abbeville and I loved coming “home” each evening to play Uno and listen to Zydeco while unwinding and filtering through photos and memories of the day.
I look forward to staying there again."

Jim and Christy are perfect hosts – they give us privacy, but quickly respond if we need anything. They were even kind enough to give us a tour of one of the other buildings on the property. On top of that their Covid-19 protocols went above and beyond, making sure the accommodations were clean, supplying disinfecting wipes, and practicing proper masking and social distancing any time we interacted.

Everywhere you looked there was another feast for the eyes . Couple that with Jim and Christys hospitality and you have a truly amazing experience awaiting you!

Stayed a few nights","This little barn-cabin is such a special spot that it's hard to convey in words how magical the space is. When you enter the folk art barn, you instantly feel like you've been transported back in time in an extremely pleasant way. Many of the dishes and decorations reminded me of my grandmother's house growing up, and it felt like being at home. The kitchen is especially charming, like Justin Wilson might appear at any moment to film a cooking show (if you're not from around here, Google it and you'll see what I mean!).
The cabin is particularly spacious, and while I came by myself to have a solo getaway, I hope to return next time with several friends in tow. This cabin and the adjacent Folk Art Honky Tonk are both on Jim and Christy's beautiful property. While it's not a completely isolated cabin, I felt like it was just the right mix of off the beaten path but close enough to Jim & Christy's main house in case anything came up.
The only thing about the stay that was more pleasant and charming than the space itself were the wonderful hosts, Jim and Christy! Where to begin... Jim and Christy were extremely gracious and attentive while also giving me plenty of space and privacy. When I arrived after dark and had trouble seeing the driveway at night, Christy came out to the main highway with a flashlight to help me find my way. They left fresh flowers on the kitchen table, brought me fresh okra and a butternut squash from their garden, and gave me a tour of the other buildings on their property that they have lovingly renovated. When I had some car trouble, Jim even went out of his way to help me charge up my car battery. Sometimes you meet people and instantly know they are really, really good folks, and that's how it felt to meet Jim and Christy.
During these times of COVID-19, this is the perfect spot to help you feel like you're on a mini vacation while also safely staying put in one place. While the cabin is a short driving distance away from several interesting parts of Cajun country and other natural settings, I was completely content staying put and enjoying the beauty of the cabin and their beautiful property. This would be a fun place now for a mini getaway with friends, and I hope that after the pandemic, I can come back when they host live music & dancing again in the Honky Tonk next door."

Stayed a few nights",Jim and Chistys place was truly a work of art and love. We loved the uniqueness of the barn and the honky tonk. The honky tonk had items from our hometown and our friends hometown. It makes a small world even smaller. Plus Christy had traveled and spent time in our neck of the woods. The loft was very clean and beds were comfortable. When the coffee pot stopped working Jim saved the day by bringing us coffee. They were great host.

It is a bit dusty, has some cobwebs, but would overall recommend a stay here! The scenery is beautiful! There are cows on the other side of the fence- it’s great hearing them moo while watching the sunrise. Don’t hesitate to stay at this quirky little barn. It’s not as secluded as I wanted, but it was a wonderful experience."

He gave us a tour of the grounds, including the Whirly Bird and the Big House. The Barn is filled with unique art and artifacts and Jim and Christy's craftsmanship and artistry are showcased in every room. Located in the Cajun countryside, it's a peaceful place to work, rest or play. Jim is incredibly knowledgeable about the local culture and music scene. We truly enjoyed listening to his stories. The Art Barn is super clean and comfortably furnished with lots of natural light and modern conveniences. The beds are comfortable and the kitchen is well-supplied with basics like salt & pepper, coffee, paper towels, a good set of pots and pans and everything else you need if you want to stay in and cook a meal. For a truly authentic adventure, I highly recommend staying at the Folk Art Barn!"

We ate locally at Cafe Josephines and even as world travelers we would highly recommend this place. True cajun food and hospitality . Our hosts were respectful of our privacy but arrived on Mothers Day morning with freshly picked blackberries. How could we not want to return to this sanctuary. Highly recommend !

Our hosts met us upon arrival and gave us a grand tour of the Art Barn, as well as the nearby honky-tank (a must-see!) and Big House. Jim and Christy are charming ex-Montessori school leaders, full of local information, and dedicated to a sustainable culture of fun. The Art Barn was comfortably furnished, and despite all the amazing antiques everywhere, had plenty of room for OUR stuff, and all the modern conveniences. Kitchen was well furnished with basics like salt&pepper, coffee, paper towels, a good set of pots and pans and everything else you need. However, we took their recommendation and ate dinner at Cafe Josephine, 4 miles down the road, which was excellent. Try the char-broiled oysters!"

When I pulled this one up I knew I found the place. And considering how quickly they responded i just sealed the deal. Upon arrival it was more than advertised. There is no possible way you can describe or post picturesof how unique this place is. Its rustic, unique, comfy, busy (meaning so much to look at,) and relaxing all in one. The amount of time and effort they put into this place probably can never be measured. But I know for a fact our next trip down we will be working around the availability of this place right here!"

They treated us like new friends and we'd recommend staying to anyone wanting a REAL travel experience.

Our intention was to use it as a base for exploring Acadiana, but as we told Jim, it was such a great spot, we could have just as easily spent the whole weekend hanging out at the folk barn and simply enjoying the space.
Jim and Christy provide a great guide full of restaurant and cultural recommendations.... also, it should be noted Jim plays the fiddle and often jams on the weekend with other Cajun musicians and he welcomed us to come watch. It was a great weekend - we hope to come back sometime."

Jim and Christy, who are incredibly warm and hospitable, had great music and food advice. (Special shout out to Fred's Lounge, the Blue Moon Saloon, the Taco Sisters and the Grand Coteau Bistro!) The folk art décor is completely charming. The space is very comfortable and roomy, has two wonderful porches and gets lots of light. We wish we could have stayed another week!"

Stayed a few nights","The Shuga Shack was the perfect Airbnb for our festival weekend getaway.
Our host (Stacie) did an excellent job of communicating before and throughout our stay. Upon arrival, we were very pleased with how clean, beautifully decorated, spacious and how well stocked this Airbnb was.
Stacie greeted us with handwritten welcome note, a gift backpack filled with an assortment of goodies and even welcomed us to home cooked meals in the freezer.
We were in town for Festival International and after a long day of festing, it was nice to come back to a relaxing fire pit in the backyard. It truly felt like home away from home.
We had a wonderful stay and highly recommend. We will be back.
Thank you!"

She had the place sweetly decorated for the season and even left a King Cake, Mardi Gras cups and snacks for us to enjoy. It was so welcoming. The cottage was comfortable, clean, and had all the amenities we needed. The location was great, and except for some road noise, very peaceful.

Stayed a few nights","I can’t say enough good things about Stacie and the Shuga’ Shack!! The house is so cute and it was spotless. Stacie keeps it very well stocked with everything you could possibly need. This is my second time to stay at the Shuga’ Shack. If I’m back in the area again, this will be my first choice!
Stacie is the best host ever! Upon entering the house, during both visits, I was greeted with gift bags of thoughtful items for myself and my family, including very special things for my two grandchildren! There were gourmet goodies in the fridge for us, as well!
I was in Sunset most recently in mid August for a special event and was in need of suggestions for a venue to host a reception. Stacie and I were in contact multiple times each week for several weeks, trying to get something put in place. She gave the very best recommendations, and our reception was perfect!
At the end of both of our stays, we accidentally left something there. Stacie had them shipped to us!!! She’s so thoughtful!"

The beds were so comfortable that I had to remind myself to not fall asleep immediately when just relaxing on them. Stacie had so many little amenities in the house that just made all of us smile. This home is at the top of my list for when I come back. I can honestly say that not one of the expensive chain hotels I have stayed at for business and personal travels could hold a candle against this home.

Stacie’s place ranks # 1 in our book, without a doubt!
WOW, was the first thing said when we opened the door.
You immediately find a hand written letter welcoming you and a big bag of goodies.
This was a first for us at any
Air BnB. The house is super inviting and cozy.
Another first is the fact that Stacie’s place literally has a freezer full of ready made meals if you arrive and don’t wanna have to cook or go looking for a restaurant. The house is also very easy to find and is super convenient being right off the interstate.
Did you forget to pack something? It’s not a problem here, cause there’s a cabinet full of complementary items for you to use and take when you leave. This Air BnB truly is the best of the best."

The place is spotless!!! It literally felt like we were the first people to stay there, I mean not a trace of use. That’s how clean this place is. Stacie and I were messaging before the stay and I mentioned that it was my husband’s birthday weekend and we’re going to the Boudin Festival bc he’s a big boudin fan. On the kitchen table, was a beautiful, professional, delicious cake from a local bakery, expertly decorated with faux boudin and boudin balls!!! She also left him a bday card and a bag with Sugashack merch for all 3 of us!!! There is every amenity you can think of, every detail has been addressed.
Favorite things: peaceful porches, games, fire pit, record player, quality linens… wish I wasn’t running out of characters here. Stacie’s license plate should say: brn2hst"

This was one of the best Airbnbs I’ve ever stayed in, in terms of the house itself, such as the decor and comfort. We were there during the Christmas season. There were very cute holiday decorations in every room, including a silver retro Christmas tree. The house was sparkling clean. It was very well stocked with everything you could possibly need.
Stacie is the best and most thoughtful hostess I’ve encountered anywhere!!
As we were headed in on the afternoon of our arrival, she reached out to offer to have the lights on for us since we would be arriving after dark. We were greeted by a gift bag on the kitchen table with some nice items. As we were traveling home, Stacie contacted me to tell me that a couple of “gifts” under the Christmas tree were actually real presents for my grandchildren. She asked for my address so she could mail them to me!
I hope to stay at Shuga Shack again!!"

Group trip","Incredible setting with spectacular oak trees, but a few issues. The house was very clean, well stocked, and nicely furnished. The owners are easy to communicate with and sent clear instructions for checking in and using house amenities. Future guests should be aware that there are some safety/repair issues. The stairs to the second floor are rickety and challenging for children or those with physical challenges. The bunk beds are not safe for children since the upper bunk mattress is higher than the railing. There is a leak between the second and first floor bathroom but we informed the owners so hopefully will be repaired The location of the house is good with easy access to Lafayette, Oppelousas, and Grand Coteau (highly recommend visiting The Kitchen Shop and eating at The Hive). We loved grabbing freshly boiled crawfish from Ruby's Crawfish Hut just down the road from the house."

Stayed with kids","The absolute best thing about this place in the beautiful gardens and the giant trees. Our kids loved to run around and explore the yard, we really enjoyed sitting around the fire pit at night!
The area is nice and remote, we like to get off the beaten track, and this was one of those stays."

Group trip","This was our first Airbnb experience and everything was perfect! It was the little getaway our family needed. We only stayed for one night, but I wish we would have stayed for the entire weekend! The five teen girls had fun celebrating our youngest daughter's birthday, our two young adult children got a chance to relax and hang out with the family since vacations together are usually no longer possible. My husband and I were able to enjoy everyone and some time together without the distractions of home. Everything we could have possibly needed was on hand and easy to locate! We only live less than two hours away and our son's college less than three hours away...like I said perfect!"

Stayed with kids",We loved our stay here!! Everything was very easy from the the time of booking to check out. Their communication was great. The house was very cool and the property was gorgeous. There was so much space for the kids to explore and play outdoors. We also loved the extra room that was detached from the house. This was perfect spot for our families to meet up and stay on Father's Day weekend.
