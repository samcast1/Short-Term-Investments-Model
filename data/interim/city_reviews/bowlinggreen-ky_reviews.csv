Group trip","Love this house. My party of 5 travel every year to this area for a racing event @ the local dragstrip. Beds were super comfortable, plenty of parking, property very quiet & peaceful. House has a lot of room & feels comfortable, like our houses back home. This is our third time here & we look forward to staying every year @ this house. Love the added island in the kitchen that wasn't there last year. Also replacing bunk beds with 2 separate beds upstairs. We also enjoyed dinner in the outdoor screened-in rear porch
Can't wait to come back here next year! Thanks Rob for opening up your beautiful home to us!!"

Group trip","Beautiful, HUGE home. I was traveling with members of a nonprofit to do some fieldwork in Bowling Green and needed a place where six people could stay and have their own beds at night. We were amazed by how large the home was and it was a wonderful landing spot after long days. Plenty of room to gather and debrief. One of our members particularly loved the screened porch."

Group trip","We stayed at Rob’s place for a thanksgiving weekend with our family from IN, KY and TN. Upon arrival I was amazed at how roomy and clean the house was! I loved all of their rooms and decor. Also loved the lighting in the rooms - such a beautiful ambiance.
We had plenty of space for the whole family. They had everything we needed, even things we didn’t know we would need! Rob was very kind and responsive to any questions we had.
The kitchen was great - we made a whole thanksgiving feast with ease and comfort all while getting to visit with family. The large dining room table was a hit and made us feel right at home. This house had plenty of bathrooms too so no one had to wait in line.
Thank you so much for a great experience!"

Group trip","I reserved Rob's house for a reunion of five high school buddies from the 1970s. We needed several bedrooms and bathrooms and wanted a few places to gather. Rob's house had it all. Spacious, comfortable, easy to find, plenty of parking, a gas grill for steak night, an enclosed porch for breakfast, a big basement for sipping bourbon and chatting in the evening. And it was surprisingly affordable. Thank you, Rob."

Stayed a few nights","The place is beautiful and really unique. It is set in an idyllic location where you feel like you are in the woods on your own private estate. The bed on the mainfloor wasn't made but the linens seemed clean so it wasnt a big deal. The other issue we had was that the internet was cut off at 10:50 (check out was 11) and my friend was finishing up a work zoom before we all headed out so that felt a little rude. Other than those two things, it was a great stay and will definitely book again if in that area!"

Stayed with kids","Beautiful home and large enough to host our party of 7 adults, 3 children, and a baby for a family weekend to celebrate our father's 60th birthday by visiting the nearby Corvette Museum. The kids enjoyed the playroom and playground structure located in the backyard. The adults enjoyed the big dining table and ample space throughout the house to gather or spread out as needed. Our only complaint would be that the tv area didn't have enough seating for us all to watch a movie together, which was a very specific activity we had wanted to do. (We had all been reading Harry Potter in prep to watch it with the kids) The house is located on a busy road that sees fairly high speeds over a blind hill, so be very mindful if you have kiddos playing in the front yard."

Group trip","This house is huge. Great for lots of people. Large open areas that you can gather together, but it also has plenty of out of the way sitting areas, if you just want to break away from the crowd. We had 8 people, the dining room table had perfect seating for our meals. The kitchen is well equipped. Modern appliances. We chose this place to reunite with WKU college friends from the mid 80s, some who had not seen one another for 26 years. This location was perfect. If you needed additional snacks a grocery superstore was about 3 miles away. We prepared all our meals and spent the entire weekend at the house just reminiscing and getting up to date on our families. Beautiful setting, we were able to take a walk in the neighborhood across the street. This was the perfect location and environment for our reunion. Rob was awesome to work with, and we would definitely stay here again."

The decor is lovely but family friendly with lots of spaces to gather....or separate! 😊 If you are in the area for a family event, this is the best value you will find... for the same price as renting several hotel rooms, this home gives you so much more!!

Stayed with kids","We had a wonderful time as a large family group staying in this home. 8 adults plus our young children. The house was easily able to accommodate us all with comfortable beds and lots of space for private time as well. The communal areas were spacious and we spent the vast majority of our time on the main floor.
The basement had a lovely play room for the kids as well as another bedroom, bathroom, kitchen and sitting area. There was even exercise equipment although I don't think any of us took advantage of it. We were just too busy.
Amenities were just down the street and very convenient.
The backyard had a play set that the kids enjoyed. We were hoping there were some hiking paths in the back woods but I did not see any. It certainly did afford a lot of privacy though. There is another house and shed on the property that is not part of the Air Bnb but we did not have any conflict with that. It was too hot to be outside and we spent the majority of the time in very comfortable air conditioning while we were at the house.We made trips every day and used this as our center of operations.
Their binder of recommended restaurants and things to do was helpful.
There were some maintenance items and house cleaning items that could use a little attention, but nothing that negatively impacted our stay. I would assume that this is the case for most rentals.
I would recommend the house to anyone."

Stayed with kids","Spent a much needed mini vacation at this lovely home, I enjoyed the many places to sit and visit with family. We cooked large meals together all gathered around the kitchen like old times, laughing and telling stories. We sat outside and drank
Coffee as the sun set and rose. We have ample table space to share our meals. This home is perfect for large families to reconnect. A girls trip to regroup there are so many options for this rental. It is an older home with a lot of charm. Lots of space and added touches that it truly feels like coming home. I enjoyed the fact that there was only one tv in the sitting room🙃 overall I give this a thumbs up. Rob was super nice and I couldn’t have asked for a easier check in and check out."

Lots of space! Bathrooms offer all the supplies needed ( e.g. soaps , shampoo, cotton balls, Q-tips, hairdryer). There are 2 big kitchens in the house and large dining areas , including a separate dining room. The house is absolutely beautiful and you will feel welcomed .
It offers an easy excess to downtown of Bowling Green ( less than 10 minutes) and it’s couple minutes away from highway 65. I hope to come back there one day."

Group trip","I'll have to be honest, I came to stay here for my wedding which we had been planning for 18 months. Me and mine now wife have been together 9 years and only had one shot at getting this right, we found this place on the Airbnb website and thought it was perfect. Had a awesome experience up until the point that we were putting our guests into their individual rooms and happened to move a small sitting chair in the corner of the toy room which turned a knob which did not have a cap on it which then exploded, and sprayed gas directly into my wife's face . She was beyond high, very incoherent and unable to function at the wedding rehearsal and dinner that evening. I do appreciate Rob's place and think that it was very nice overall but the fact that something to that degree was not immediately taken care of even after I addressed it with Rob himself and said he would be there in 10 minutes to look at the problem, wearing which he never showed up and we ended up checking out. if you want to keep your sanity and do not want to accidentally inhale fumes or gas from uncapped lines then I would not recommend staying here."

Group trip","Rob's house was massive! Plenty of area to spread out, and the rooms were huge too. We had our wedding party stay with us and the photographers and videographers we hired loved the setting for photos. Also, we had some packages delivered to the house the day before we arrived and Rob took the packages inside for us. He was very responsive to messages and even gave us a tour a couple of weeks before our visit. Very accomodating!
One thing to note is that pulling out of the property on to the street is terrifying, as cars are coming around a corner and over a hill at 60+ mph. Just be aware when you first leave the property."

We communicated this to the owner and they’re taking the next few steps to take care of that situation. A few things needed fixing, and the owner is also taking care of this. The house had a thermostat which worked great in some parts of the house but not very well in others. The house was pretty warm. Communication with the owner was great. Overall, the house was worth what we paid for."

The access for those with some mobility issues is good, you can enter in without going up steps and there are 2 rooms on the main level. Air fresheners are in the house, so if you are sensitive to those smells I would suggest asking that they be removed before arrival. Host was very gracious and easy to work with. There were nice touches in the house including local information, fruit and candy. We will stay there again when we return to Bowling Green."

The drive to/from the stadium was 10 minutes or less. The house is very spacious and is perfect for groups because there are a few different areas to hang out. With our group, the adults stayed mostly in the dining room to visit and play cards on the large dining room table and the teenagers chose to lounge in the upstairs family area. Plenty of bathrooms to go around and the extra fridge space (there is a 2nd kitchen in the basement) came in handy. We would definitely stay here again."

It is a fully remodeled home in a great area with a 3 minute walk to a grocery story and plenty of restaurants and a hospital just across the street. Older neighborhood that is very quiet and we felt very safe. Comfortable beds, kitchen with everything we needed to make our meals, washer and dryer with detergent, beautiful living area with a huge TV and super comfortable chairs and a couch, a dinning room with a nice size table was plenty room for our family of 6 to enjoy our meals at. This house has a beautiful decor all throughout that just brightens up your day and makes you feel very comfortable and right at home! Tracy thought about every detail in the house from the decor to simple things like a wonderful smelling body wash and shampoo to plenty of board games for our kids. Cant praise this place enough! Will come back when in BG."

Stayed a few nights","If you want the convenience of downtown, this is the place! During our stay, we were able to walk to breakfast at Spencer’s Coffeehouse and to dinner at Anna’s Green restaurant. Mellow Mushroom is literally across the parking lot and shopping is right around the corner.
This place is perfect for a single person or a couple who really like each other! The wall between the kitchen/living around does not extend to the ceiling so all light and sound is seen/heard on both sides.
The kitchen has all the basics (dishes, pots, pans, etc.) but no seasonings, oil, sugar, etc. afforded at others places. Not a deal breaker, just something I appreciate when I want to cook while traveling.
If you plan to have guests, be aware that you have to obtain permission first. There are also mandatory quiet hours although the building was very quiet all the time.
It’s a nice, clean apartment although the bathroom could’ve used a little more attention. Not a huge deal because I tend to wipe things down before settling in especially now during the pandemic.
I did not meet the host, Jaime, but she was excellent with communication! Very responsive!
All of that being said, I would not hesitate to stay at the property again. My husband and I got exactly what we needed this holiday weekend!"

Stayed a few nights","This was an amazing home & Amanda is the nicest person you will ever meet!
The weather was severe while my son & I were driving to Bowling Green & Amanda messaged me to let me know how the weather looked in Bowling Green & to tell us to be careful. She responded to all my questions promptly throughout our stay.
The house was gorgeous. It’s an older home with so much character, & it was spotless with all the amenities we needed. Having two bedrooms & two bathrooms was so nice.
There are many large, older homes in the area & we enjoyed walking through the neighborhood(s) & also walking to the historic downtown area. It isn’t far at all.
My son & I travel alone & we felt very safe here.
We loved the large front porch & rocking chairs that were there, too! A lot of games of Uno were played out there!
It was nice to have a washer/dryer in the basement, too.
I just can’t say enough nice things about Amanda & her property other than I highly recommend it! You won’t be disappointed!"

Stayed with kids","We really enjoyed our two-night stay at Amanda’s place on our road trip to Nashville! The house is clean, bright, and spacious, and you can tell that thought was put into the decor. We appreciated the little touches like the snacks and the coffee and accompaniments! Those little touches most definitely set this place apart from other airbnbs we have stayed in. I enjoyed some much needed R&R on the porch swing while our toddler napped and husband went to the Corvette museum! We found the neighbors to be very warm and friendly as well!
The location was great, but unfortunately some of the recommendations we wanted to try are closed on Sundays. We did have a great breakfast at Wild Eggs, and enjoyed a morning cave boat tour at The Lost Cave. If you have little ones, or even if you don’t, make the drive the Chaney’s dairy barn, especially if it’s on one of their “moovie” nights!
Amanda was responsive and kind, and we would absolutely not hesitate to stay at her place again if our travels ever bring us back to Bowling Green!"

Being pet friendly was also a great perk as many AirBnBs have alot of restrictions or don't allow pets at all. I definitely recommend staying here.

Stayed with kids","5-STAR REVIEW! Our last-minute stay at Lindsey’s beautifully restored historic home in downtown Bowling Green was nothing short of exceptional. When we urgently needed a place due to my niece's upcoming delivery, Lindsey responded immediately, easing much of our stress. The home itself, with enough room to comfortably accommodate our family of 12, was a perfect blend of historical charm and modern amenities. We were particularly grateful for the accessible first-floor suite that provided comfort for my elderly parents. My nieces were thrilled with their unique dual king bed nooks, making it a memorable part of their stay. It’s located conveniently close to local shops and eateries and Lindsey’s place offered both the comfort of home and the excitement of exploring downtown. We highly recommend this Airbnb for anyone seeking a thoughtful and comfortable stay in a beautifully historic setting near WKU."

The owner clearly takes great care of this home and is invested in making visitors as comfortable as possible. Location was less than a 10 minute drive from every restaurant we tried and a very short walk from a great Thai restaurant. I would definitely stay again and recommend this Airbnb to others!

Stayed with kids","The house is located about two blocks from ""The Square"" in downtown Bowling Green which feels safe and walkable. We ate once at Mellow Mushroom, twice at Gerard's 1907 and highly recommend Gerard's for the food quality, great service and friendly atmosphere provided by a local restauranteur who greeted us both evenings. Ice cream, cookies, baked goods, and espresso are all within a short walk of the house.
The inside of the house is pretty much as advertised, beds and furniture were comfortable.
Further away from the house we were really impressed with Beech Bend Park for the dozens of amusement rides, well staffed pools, lazy river and all around family atmosphere. Beech Bend Park offers much more value than big parks like Disney, Dollywood, etc. Maybe not the high tech and hype of a big park but for a fraction of the price the short wait times and generous ride lengths made this park a lot more fun for the kids and more satisfying for the adults to see the kids smiles."

They even had a bottle of wine and cheese tray waiting for us which was awesome! Plenty of glassware in the kitchen for a variety of drinks. The living room was a great place to hang out and had blue tooth enabled music which was nice. I would highly recommend this house to anyone wanting to be near the downtown BG area!

We experienced some severe storms while we were there and the yurt did not leak or falter in any way. Gena even offered us accommodations at her own home if we felt unsafe in the yurt but it was sturdy. It was easy to find and a 15 min drive from mammoth cave.

rachel’s place is very clean and equipped and there’s so much to do right there in the square. we would definitely recommend and definitely stay again."

Stayed a few nights","Enjoyed two nights at this lovely apartment full of charm and antique furniture. Everything was clean and functioning properly. Comfortable beds, nice linens. Location on Fountain Square is walkable to several restaurants and shops. We enjoyed breakfast both mornings at Spencer's Coffee and wonderful dinners at Anna's Greek and Gerard's 1907. We also had warm cookies from Insomnia, bought some souvenirs from the Candle shop, and attended a free show at the WKU planetarium. Mammoth Cave National Park is an easy 40 min drive. We visited mid-week, so wasn't much nightlife around the square, but that also meant evenings were pretty quiet, other than some occasional traffic noise - could definitely see that weekends could be noisy. There were coffee pods, teas, snacks, and bottled water provided. Be aware that there are several steep stairs up to the apartment to lug your luggage up. Queen bed is in a separate, private bedroom; King bed is in an open area. No issues with finding parking."

We were in town to visit family nearby and enjoyed this home away from home. No noise issues during our visit, although, we were well aware that that could happen thanks to the clear information and instructions provided by the host. Perhaps that is more of an issue in the summer time with events going on. Wonderful location and amenities. Responsive and attentive host. The check out list was also very short and reasonable. We appreciate it!"

Stayed one night","Location was perfect for what we needed, we had saw a show at SKY PAC . The square was beautifully decorated for Christmas and there were lots of restaurants. Parking was limited, but given the area and time of year it was understandable. Space open and large. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because of the lack of communication. I had asked about a possibly early check in and did not get a response. The WiFi password did not work, which really wasn’t too big of a deal to us, we did see the host in passing at check in and communicated about the WiFi. She was very nice and welcoming, and said to let her know if we did end up wanting to use the WiFi she had a new password. I tried calling her cell, left a message and never got a response. Overall the stay was great, but I would have preferred a response about check in and the WiFi password. I would stay again, as the location was perfect, the price was great, and the space was very spacious and nice."

Stayed a few nights","I absolutely LOVED Rachel's space. Everything was exactly as described and being above a candle store made it even better, because you could smell all the delicious candles as soon as you walked into the building. Of course, I visited Candlemakers on the Square as soon as I got to town and made a small purchase. Everything was comfortable and clean, though my friend and I didn't spend much time there. Just enough to sleep and shower. We were in town for the first Kentucky Massage Championships. Rachel checked in with me to make sure we made it in and had no issues getting into the building, which we didn't!
I would definitely recommend Rachel's space to anyone that's traveling through the area, and I will be telling all my friends about it as well! Thanks for a great stay!!!"

Stayed a few nights","This loft on the square is adorable! The area is nice and the place is very spacious and well equipped. Rachel was prompt to respond to questions. We didn’t have any issues with nighttime noise that some mentioned but the bar under the space is now closed so that may help. The only thing that wasn’t clear to me from the posting is that the king bed that’s adjacent to the living area is totally in the open with no curtains or sliding pocket doors to close it off, so anyone going to the bathroom at night has to walk by the bed. Great for a family with kids or a girls trip but a bit awkward for couples sharing the space. So just something to be aware of, probably not an issue for most folks! The king bed was super comfy though!! Would definitely stay again."

Stayed one night","Enjoyed our stay at the loft. I love this area of historic Bowling Green. The loft was very spacious and had a great view of the square. The loft was very well decorated with furniture that adds lots of character. However there were a few discrepancies that would have to be addressed before we stayed again. Such as the windows in the kitchen look directly in to the neighboring apartment with no curtains or blinds to shut for privacy. ( the neighbor had no curtains or blinds either ). The main entrance in to the loft was an outward swinging interior door with no dead bolt but instead it had a chain lock which was made for an inward swinging door, so it could easily be undone from the outside. As far as cleanliness goes it was clean but could use a deep clean, ( dusty base boards, stained grout in bathroom, dirty drip pans on stove, dusty HVAC vents ) but no major cleanliness issues. Other than that we enjoyed our stay but the privacy and security issues would need to be addressed."

My only complaint isn't with the Airbnb but with the area. If you go on a weekend the college kids will be loud and rowdy until around 3am. There was a fight under the windows of the place when I was there and it woke me up at around 1 am. Keep that in mind if you go."

This was simple. The location was WONDERFUL. I honestly can’t say enough about this location. If you are looking for somewhere to stay in Bg. Try this out. You will not regret it"

Stayed one night","My stay in Bowling Green was very enjoyable, what a cute little town with lots of shops and restaurants. The lodging was as expected and clean other than a mold on the bathroom vents. The only downside was once the nightclub next door closed around 1 am there was a lot of noise in the square until around 2 am."

There was some nighttime noise, but Rachel had warned us ahead of time and provided white noise machines, which were very helpful. We would definitely stay here again."

Check in was smooth. The location on the center of the downtown park was convienent we were able to walk to the many different places to see. The date also corresponded to the Christmas tree lighting ceremony and my birthday. Thank you

Beautiful old apartment in my beautiful home town’s downtown area. We loved staying in a place that had character. It was beautifully decorated for Christmas and very charming and homey. Plenty of room for a week long stay. We live less than an hour from BG so it was a staycation of sorts. We’ll keep it in mind for future close to home vacays! :)

Stayed one night","If you love thrift stores, antiquing, and flea markets, this eclectic apartment is for you. The mix of furnitures, books, and fixtures very much felt like staying in a picker’s paradise.
We enjoyed our stay, finding it centrally located and spacious.
Pros of this stay were a comfy bed, gorgeous views of the square, and an eclectic mix of reading materials and KY history coffee table books to entertain on a chilly day.
Very good bed and proximity to Mammoth Caves. Be aware if you’re from out of town that the downtown area rolls up the carpet on Sundays and Mondays, seriously nothing is open but the Mellow Mushroom (a quick 6 min walk away).
This isn’t the place for travelers with disabilities, allergies, small children, or who really need a working kitchen. None of these where an issue for us, but there were A LOT of smells (candle shop, old building with odd office-style ceilings that make things a little musty, and a very old stove mean I would turn elsewhere if any of these are an issue for you. But if they are not, and quirky is your thing, this is a great stop in downtown Bowling Green."

Stayed one night","After having several travel delays we got into Bowling Green late and just happened to meet Rachel and her daughter. They were great and super helpful in orienting us to what food and drink was available. The space is a large and well appointed apartment type space. There are stairs to get to the space but the location affords an excellent view of the square. It was a Saturday night so there was typical downtown people noise but the supplied white noise machines took care of that. Parking is on the street but ample and close. After having passed Bowling Green for years on the interstate, I was glad we took the time to explore the downtown. Totally worth the detour."

Stayed a few nights","Hello Rachel! We loved our stay. Your apartment is charming. The only negative feedback we had was (as you had noted in the listing) the noise level on the weekends. It was rather shocking to us. Friday night we heard the noise but I informed my guests that I was informed of this and it was just a small congregation outside. We all noted no one had looked out the windows to confirm, but the congregation sounded kind of large. On Saturday the noise was far more amplified with pedestrians, loud music, and loud cars/motorcycles. This time, inquisitive about what was occurring, I took a look outside of the window and to my astonishment there was over 100 people (easily) outside having a party in the square. Overall, the party was controlled and I felt my car was safe amongst the crowd, but it was still not ideal when trying to sleep at 2am. The party lasted until around 2:45. I noticed three cops trying to calmly disperse the crowd. I understand this situation is beyond your control and you have done your best to inform visitors and best accommodate their needs during their trip. But, due to the repeated events and larger than small congregation as noted, I did reduce the location score on my review. Otherwise we loved everything your home had to offer."

We were there on a Saturday night and as Rachel puts in her description, it was loud from people on the street. Not an issue for either the Sun or Mon nights we stayed. Restaurants on the main avenue around the park were not open Sun or Mon so you will need to drive.
It’s a second floor loft above a small shop (cute and local artisans) so beware of stairs if you have limitations.

Stayed one night","Loved Jennifer’s place! It felt so nostalgic and eccentric. The building itself was absolutely stunning and made me only want to see the rest, know the history, etc. The exposed brick is everything. She left us some candies on the counter with the house instructions and other important info. There was also a guest book for entries which is always really nice reading. There were 3 things that stood out, one of which really concerned me and that when we first got there, we noticed that the side door was completely unlocked. Also, I did find a pair of women’s underwear on the hallway bench that did not belong to me and the entry locks were a little iffy time to time. It seemed like the lock kept getting stuck on the latch. Check out was super easy. The checkout instructions were very clear and was able to locate the trash bin. the washer and dryer was right next to the front door so it was super convenient to toss the sheets in the washer before locking up. Highly recommend!"

Cons: Some road noise in the master bedroom, small kitchen table for six people, lots of stairs, no laundry detergent (only fabric softener). Overall, we really enjoyed this home. It was easy to find, easy to get into, location was pretty and convenient. We would stay here again."

The inside was immaculate, and despite being a studio it felt spacious! The only downside was the futon, I should have used the provided air mattress instead. The futon is unfortunately a bit uncomfortable for a side-sleeper or someone who moves around at all while sleeping.
This is a great value and totally worth it in my opinion! I'd stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","Jaime’s listing was very clean and everything you would need is provided in the kitchen and toiletries. As listed there is no traditional bed, there was an air mattress and futon provided. The air mattress loses air throughout the night just enough to be noticeable but wasn’t a huge deal. The futon was also comfortable but was slightly ripped near the moving parts but that wasn’t a big deal either. I am 6 foot and fit on the futon just fine and slept comfortably throughout the night. The biggest attraction is the location to downtown bowling green and proximity to Mammoth NP. The property is a 2 minute walk to downtown and approximately 30 minutes to Mammoth making it a great location to use as a home-base while visiting the park and visiting other attractions. Jaime was very responsive answering messages within 5 minutes when we had questions. This is a great place to stay for two people on a budget or for those who aren’t picky about their sleeping arrangements."

WiFi was blazing fast for working remote!
Two things to note - which Jamie clearly calls out in the description. There are no windows - it’s the “hideaway” and the futon doubles as the bed. It’s not the most comfortable BUT the $ is brillant and you have everything you could need including a full sized kitchen, laundry and bathroom. Plus is perfectly clean and safe area.
Jamie is responsive to any questions and provides clear instructions for check in.
Great base for exploring Mammoth Cave National Park, Corvette Museum, Lost River and more!"

As a minimalist, I love simplicity, and the Hideout was just right for my needs. The futon was surprisingly comfortable and I enjoyed having a place to cook and do laundry during my month-long stay. I would definitely recommend this Airbnb! Also, be sure to check out Spencer's Coffee, The Hearth Room (great little shop for soaps and things), and Mary Jane's Chocolates."

We rented this property for almost four months. We only had a couple of small issues during our stay with losing connection to cable, but both times it happened I got in touch with owner and she had us back on in minutes.

Very clean, tidy and comfortable. The foliage, scenery and surroundings were absolutely beautiful. Once we entered, we were greeting to such a beautiful little home, music playing with the fireplace going; warm hot tub and a small fire was still burning outside. Talk about heaven. We also got to meet their sweet little beagle who made sure we knew they were there. (: There are absolutely no complaints. The only things that stood out for me were upon arriving and getting unpacked I noticed there is a presence of ants. This is a cabin, they are to be expected and nothing traps can’t fix. Another thing, the hot tub did read for a filter replacement. We would’ve stayed out longer had there been more lighting but because it was so dark, we didn’t feel too confident getting in and out on the steps."

Stayed one night","This tiny cabin was the perfect getaway for mine and my boyfriend Valentine’s Day. We felt so much peace being here and very welcomed by the host. We are already talking about wanting to come back for another stay. Everything described in the listing matched was we had, and exceeded our expectations. The host were very responsive any time we had a question, and it was good to know that if we needed anything they were there. We would absolutely recommend!"

There was plenty of firewood and the fire pit was already prepped by the time we arrived. The kitchen had everything we needed and plenty of dishes. All the appliances were modern and everything was spotless. The cabin was very warm and cozy. There is ample room for parking. The hot tub was very clean and enjoyable. They also were constantly checking on us to make sure we needed anything. Very above and beyond host. 10/10 stay!"

The unit was exactly as described. At check-in time she sent instructions on where to park, how to access the unit, etc. The unit had plenty of space and all the things you'd need for a several day stay."

Stayed a few nights","Our stay was good. We weren’t there much & the location was exactly what we needed while moving our daughter in 3 min away. The kitchen had practically everything one needs to make a meal, seasoning included. Ice machine worked & the water is good & the water pressure in the shower is fantastic too. It’s close to downtown where we enjoyed ice cream at The Meltdown. It was a bit strange to not have any windows but it was fine. The room temp was easy to manage, we didn’t have to mess with the thermostat except for when we left & returned for the night. Parking was okay as we were able to park out front most nights. I was there by myself 2 nights & did have to park in the parking lot behind the building one evening. It was dark & just a little unsettling getting myself back to the front of the building. I found a cut through that wasn’t lit, I could have walked around but it was fine. Beds were fine, I would recommend bringing your own pillow as most of us do. We would stay again"

Stayed over a week",Jamie’s place is right downtown Bowling Green which makes it easily within walking distance of several restaurants. The place itself is an interior unit aka no windows at all. The unit is furnished and supplied as described but nothing else. The floors are concrete with some well worn area rugs. The kitchen lacks prep space for any cooking - so it’s best to walk to the nearby eateries.
