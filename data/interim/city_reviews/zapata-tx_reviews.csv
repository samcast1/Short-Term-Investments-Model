Stayed with kids",This was in a quiet neighborhood with a nice carport to park your car that kept it cool during our stay. Had a Dollar General nearby to get a few groceries. Was also pleased to see law enforcement personnel living nearby. Other than that nice little home away from home.

With my family, I felt a lot more at ease after arriving, luis has security cameras as well as door bell camera on the property. His residence was way more spacious than expected and very clean. Thank you Luis for being a great host as well as being flexible with us. Would definately stay again if I'm in the area."

Stayed with a pet","1st things 1st my girls were happy from the start! House was a warm comfortable fishing cabin, but that is kind of a understatement. The view from the back towards the lake was amazing! And at night you could see the bright LED lights from the UTVs cruising around the lake and people just enjoying life. During the day the restaurants in Zapata were perfect! BUT our host Tony was a all around life saver! I wasn’t in town for fish, I was there to do work on our dear lease in Falcon. Camping just wasn’t a option for my girls especially in this heat in Texas, but nonetheless I had work to get done. During our adventure miles from the nearest highway 83 I had a blowout in my 4x4. I was able to get the spare on and get back to the main road but wasn’t feeling comfortable with the old wanky spare. So I reached out to Tony just for a recommendation. Holy smokes the people treated us like family replaced 2 tires and got us back on the road. Couldn’t have gone any better. Thanks Tony! HERO!"

The beds, pillows and sofas were all very soft and comfortable. Everything was so clean and smelled nice and refreshing. We took a little kiddie pool for out toddlers and set it up in the bbq area/balcony. Took an ATV and used that to access the lake as it was quite a distance from the home. We really enjoyed ourselves and appreciate the cleanliness and decor. Would recommend Tony's place for a nice family getaway."

The two full size restrooms were great for our family. The place definitely needs a deep cleaning. The floors need attention as well as the kitchen cabinets. There were a couple of spider webs hanging in the house. Overall it was a good experience. The house is definitely a lovely place.

The bed was comfortable and the split air/heat unit helped to drown out the loud music."

Bring your can of propane for the grill.
Bring some kitchen linens for washing dishes. Bring a 12 cup coffee maker,coffee, creamer, and sugar if you have more than 1 person. A/C and heat worked great! TV was great! The awning with lights was great for rigging baits and doing boat stuff at night. The gate is a little tight for a 21ft bassboat but we got it in there. We had a good time and will come back. Just make sure if you use the ramp in town that when you go to the main channel go around the red things. Either on left or right. DO NOT go between there is a bridge underwater about a foot you can’t see!!!"

Stayed with kids","Noe is an extremely humble and respectful man. His home is beautiful. I experienced a very relaxing environment and he respected me and my families space, half of the time I forgot he lived so close to us. It’s so clean in his place that it encouraged me to keep the place clean. It was super organized. Bed was super comfy. Sheets was nice and felt premium. AC was spot on. Driveway access super easy and you’re right there in the middle of town. Couldn’t have had a better stay here in Zapata. Thank you Noe!"
