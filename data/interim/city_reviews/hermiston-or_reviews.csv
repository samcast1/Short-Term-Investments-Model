Stayed over a week","I stayed two weeks and didn't want to leave at the end. Everything about the experience was perfect. The host is very caring and responsive to questions. The neighborhood is quiet, clean, and safe. I absolutely loved relaxing on the beanbag chair and the main room bed gave me the most comfortable sleeping experience. I definitely want to stay here again."

Stayed over a week",The host’s were awesome. The property was clean and well stocked. Close to everything. W 2 bathrooms the place is perfect for traveling workers like myself. The price was incredibly low compared to other properties and hotels. Extremely pleased with my experience. Only regret was not being able to rent it the entire time I was in town because it was booked. Will definitely try to come back if I’m ever back out this way for work or pleasure.

Stayed a few nights","Jodi's home exudes an aura of privacy and coziness that instantly envelops you from the moment you step through the front door. It's not just a place to stay; it's an experience that leaves you inspired and rejuvenated. Every detail is meticulously arranged to make you feel like you belong there, fostering a sense of comfort and security unlike any other. As someone new to Airbnb, this stay has set the bar impossibly high, leaving me with an unwavering certainty that hotels will never compare to the thoughtful and accommodating haven that Jodi has created. It's not just a place to rest your head; it's a sanctuary that leaves a lasting impression.
Thank you a trillion,

Stayed a few nights","The place was excellent, very clean. My only quibble is that I had arranged to meet someone to put my bags inside prior to their normal check-in. After waiting for 45 minutes, I had to leave for an event. As a result, my laptop had to stay in my car while I attended the event (there was no other option). If I had know this might happen I would have left my laptop at home. The car was parked in a public (and unattended) lot for about 8 hours. Fortunately it was not stolen. It would have caused a serious hardship if it had been. I was put at risk by the lack of follow-through. Again, this is my only reason it is rated 4, not 5."

The host was great. Lots of information and communication before our stay so we knew what to expect and how to check-in and access everything we would need. The kitchen came stocked with all the dishes and cookware we needed.
Check out was easy and the price was a great value for 4 people and a dog in the house.
We would stay here again on future trips to Eastern Oregon and recommend to our friends."

Stayed with a pet","Ryan is about the best host we've met and his place was perfect for our needs. He responded quickly to our questions, putting us at ease about a visit that had lots of constraints.
We needed a pet friendly place where our daughter's young family could visit us, as they are living in a strictly no-pet rental in Umatilla while on temporary work assignment. Our grandsons were able to play in Ryan's large grassy field, enjoying some dirt and a big climbing toy. They even got see chickens and friendly cats like they have at home.
The apartment was the cleanest pet-friendly place we have seen and was perfect for our pup who is still learning his manners.
Thanks, Ryan! we hope to stay again!"

Stayed with a pet","This Air BNB is a little gem in the country side. The peaceful setting will force you to relax.
Everything about this place was perfect for our family of 3 + 2 dogs. It's simple, modern, and peaceful.
A perfect get away.
The property is extremely secure and secluded. We left our cars unlocked without thinking twice about it... it is that secure.
Ryan and family are super awesome; Extremely attentive and responsive; and they made us feel right at home.
There are some house rules, this place is in the country and the country is not kind to nice things... and this is a nice place.
Getting to the site could be confusing if you do not read the instructions provided, but once you get there you'll really appreciate just how secluded it is from everything else. It's still only 5 minutes away from stores and restaurants, and Hermiston surprisingly has a good selection of local and chained restaurants to pick from.
PS. At night, don't forget to look up at the stars."

The electric outlets were very weak taking much more time to charge any devices than normal and the wi-fi was barely usable…although ryan said he was going to improve that soon. All in all as a simple get away stay this would be amazing. The full kitchen and incredible attention to detail with their cleaning was above and beyond. Great spot!

Stayed with a pet","This place is very comfortable and clean! Just a few of the perks:
- My husband, who is straight out of the Goldilocks story and hates almost every bed on earth, was comfortable on the bed.
- There is a large grassy area for pets to do their thing. Please note that if you do not have good voice control they should stay on leash - while there is a fence, it is not completely fenced, and there is a good amount of wildlife (plus the chickens) on the property.
- The wildlife is also a perk - we saw quail, hawk, and some feral kittens... no, you don't get to keep the kittens.
- The AC worked great and kept the interior very comfortable in 110+ degree heat!
Some things to know:
- The water is from a well, and for the first few moments of running, it has a smell. This dissipates quickly and the water tasted fine. If you are sensitive to water in new areas, there is plenty of storage area on the counter for bottled water.
- If you bring dogs, be nice to Ryan and bring some poop bags :)
- Be sure to follow the detailed instructions for getting there, they were very helpful.
- There is a grocery store about five minutes away, so do not worry if you forgot anything."

He really understood the value in having a place where people can stay with their dogs (they are family!) He has a lot of land where we could explore and have the dogs off leash too. The barn was really clean and it seemed like he was very conscientious about keeping it that way. Lots of amenities for cooking (we made a couple of meals) and he was available to give advice about places to go around town if needed. He also provided fresh eggs from his chickens- a wonderful bonus! Ryan was very friendly and responsive and communicated well. We would definitely stay there again!!

The apartment was spotless, welcoming and had everything we needed to relax after a long, long drive.
We really appreciated the space in the driveway for our truck and all of our gear and we felt very safe and well taken care of.
The Wifi rocks and the fresh eggs are dynamite in the morning while watching the chicken do their thing out the back window.
I will be staying here every time I roll through on my way to the Oregon coast!

The townhouse was very clean and had all the amenities we needed. I had to contact Saira a few times and it was almost an instant response. She is very kind and we highly recommend staying at this location. The only few downfalls we noticed while staying was that there was no mop to clean the floors. But for a shorter stay I probably wouldn’t have needed to mop the floors. And due to the limited parking we weren’t always able to park on the street in front of the house. We had to park down the street. But that wouldn’t detour us away from booking this house again.

Saira was very nice and communicated well.
We stayed a month during the winter so we had the heat on a lot. the downstairs does not heat up well and stays a little chilly.
There was a big snow storm while we were there and no snow shovel on the property. That made things a little challenging.
But over all it was a comfortable stay and we wouldn't mind staying again."

Magpies, Kingfishers, doves, chicadees, and nuthatches were right there in the trees on Linda's place. Her beautiful cottage and gardens were like a little time capsule from bygone days. Thank you Linda, for providing all the comforts and extra amenities. We would love to stay with you again."

Linda is a superb hostess, anticipating needs and went above and beyond to mail my pillow that I’d accidentally left behind. The little town of Echo has small American charm with the railroad and river running through it. There’s a small dog park along the river just across the way. Recommend H & P Cafe, just a block away, where I received very friendly service and a delicious patty melt. This is a perfect little bnb."

Stayed one night","What a great little place! We loved the comfortable setup above the garage, the comfy bed, the occasional sounds of the farm and the train horn. This is the sort of place that Airbnb was made for, in my opinion – a cool little space on a private property that I wouldn't otherwise have had the chance to experience, and at a good price. We arrived during a heat wave, so it was hot when we got there, but a few hours with the window-mounted a/c and a fan made a big difference, and we slept comfortably. I'd happily stay there again!"

The stars were also a great addition and you can see them from the skylight above the bed at night. The hot water works really well. We explored the local area and went into Pendleton too which was fun. There are a lot of museums and the woolen mill was a cool place to visit. There's a casino a few miles east of Pendleton which has stuff for the kids and a movie theater that's inexpensive. We want to come back.

The apartment was very clean, spacious, and had all of the amenities one could ask for. The pups had a blast walking down to the river before sundown and then in the morning when they were able to run around the yard and play with Linda’s adorable farm dog. The town of Echo was very quiet as I left early but my coffee cake and latte from the local coffee shop was delicious. My only complaint is I wish I could have stayed longer!"

Be prepared for the little insects & critters that come around including the smells. It felt like a scene from the story Charlotte's Web. The place was quiet but every so often you would here the train pass by. The airbnb is located upstairs about 17 stairs incase for anybody that have a difficult time climbing. We visited the pigs they're so cute. Linda told us upon arrival to feel free and let her now if we need anything she would accommodate us. My husband, son and I really enjoyed staying at that airbnb. Linda was a great host. We highly recommend this place. Sincerely, the Duran family."

Stayed one night","Staying here felt like we were stopping overnight at a distant relative’s place in the country. The pros are that Linda was nice enough, she let us walk her property and it was pretty laid back. The cons are that it was as clean as you’d expect for a casual overnight at your great aunt’s house who has better things to do than clean. Which, I totally get, its just not my preference for lodging. The couch/pull out bed really shouldn’t be listed as a sleeping space as it’s very old and uncomfortable, even for smaller people (our kids). My 13yo son ended up sleeping on the floor instead. Side note- If you wake up to train horns, you’ll wake up around three times during the night. It sounds like this place has been a great fit for a lot of people, unfortunately it wasn’t for us."

Television for viewing though we didn’t use it.

Stayed one night","While Linda's place was exactly as advertised and provided all the necessary amenities, I was unable to spend the night the property due to a bug issue. When I entered the apartment, the ceiling was covered with bugs crawling around. I found three in the bed and on the pillow, while a spider was hanging out in the window directly behind the headboard. There were a few bugs in the bathroom too, and by the time I decided to leave, a few had made their way into my luggage. I got out of there as fast as I could and had to book a hotel almost an hour away to spend the night. Again, while Linda's place was fine on its own, the bug issue was something I could not overlook."

We were able to walk to breakfast and a winery for afternoon tastings. There is a little park, a few eateries, and two wineries within easy walking. With COVID, we were glad to find a spot that was all to ourselves.
Only downsides: had to wash our own dishes before use (dirty in dishwasher), and no response from our host till the morning we left, which made ""check-in"" difficult (which she apologized for). Thanks for the peaceful get away, Linda!"

Sounds of roosters and birds rather than traffic and hotel vacuums. It was a peaceful oasis away from my work day and I think travelers will enjoy this green little area of Echo, Oregon. Linda leaves interesting books about the area and is very available to answer questions or give recommendations. Would love to stay there again!"

The location is ideal for a stopover between Boise and the Seattle area.
We arrived at dinner time on a Sunday and had a great dinner at the Broken Barrel in Stanfield - a little way past the railroad tracks from Linda’s.
We will definitely stay here again and give ourselves some time to explore Echo and the river."

There is a small river on the property that you can access from the house, which was a nice bonus for us, because we love to fish! The place was clean and had everything we needed. The communication was great and Linda even offered up her fishing pole. There is a small grocery store a few minutes away and a larger city another 5 or 10 minutes from there. We would stay again if we are passing through that way."

Stayed a few nights",The place is fine. We were in town for business for three days. We were really only in the house to sleep. We got in late and out early. One bummer was the cable TV. Actually lack of it. It’s a Roku tv so no local anything. Also. The welcome book says there are many subscription services to choose from. That is true. But. You have to have your own subscriptions to view any kind of content at all. That’s really my only complaint as the Seahawks were on Monday night football and it really took a bit to finally get to watch them. ON MY PHONE. Not the nice tv the house had.

This is a small but very clean, comfortable and well equipped home. There were four of us, three females and one male (my poor husband) and the home size worked just fine for us. The bathroom is tiny but was no problem for us. The home is centerally located so restaurants, grocery and entertainment are just minutes away.

Stayed over a week","We stayed for 28 days. We were very happy with the host’s flexibility in allowing early check in at 11am. This small home has been recently painted and well decorated. The kitchen is a bit small and the absence of a vent hood for the stove caused issues when cooking, leaving lingering smells. The living room, unfortunately has an extremely uncomfortable futon couch that required us to use 6 pillows just to tolerate it for short periods while we watched tv. The bedrooms had comfy mattresses and one of the rooms has a TV. Our biggest issue with this property was that we felt as though the listing pictures of the bathroom weren’t accurate. It is very small, walking straight in you easily swipe the sink and doorknob at the same time with your body. Additionally the shower is smaller than an RV shower, with an odor coming from the drain.
We did experience a delayed response from our host towards the end of our stay, when the door lock code stopped working and we were locked out temporarily"

Communication with them was easy and they were very quick to respond. The house was in great proximity to where I needed to go and was in a great location for restaurants, stores, etc. The house is very quaint and was extremely clean. There were added little touches like a variety of Tazo teas, honey sticks, herbs, spices, etc. There is a large choice of dvds, reliable Wifi, an Alexa as well as many other things to make your stay pleasant. Having shampoo, conditioner, and body wash in the shower was very helpful and saved me on having to pack anything extra. The beds were very comfortable and so were the pillows.
This is obviously out of their control but the neighbors to the back of the house and to the side of the backyard have a dog that they allow to bark for extended periods of time, early morning and evening as well. I noticed quite a few little caterpillars in the kitchen and near the front door and relocated them outside the front door. When I opened the front door there were quite a few caterpillars out there and obviously where they were coming in from. The ""sofa bed"" that is listed is really not what I would consider to be a sofa bed and was extremely uncomfortable. I am only 5'4"" but if a tall person were trying to sleep on it, they would have a difficult time. Besides the sofa in the living room there are two chairs that were just okay and positioned in a way that if there were more than one or two people it would be uncomfortable and difficult to watch the TV.
I would definitely stay there again should the need come up."

Stayed with kids","We enjoyed our stay! We loved the clean house, beautiful colors and great layout of the rooms. Did I mention the beautiful colors? The colors and textures were inspiring, happy and peaceful. The bathroom was small but manageable. I personally loved the many lighting options and the soft, warmly lit lanterns in the kids’ bedroom.
The master bedroom with the TV was very tranquil with the adorable baby plants and water images. Wifi was easy with the beautiful ceramic wifi sign. So many details made our stay accommodating, from the coasters on the coffee table to the cup and plating options in plastic (for the kids) and ceramic (for the adults). Loved having a large-capacity coffee maker and the washer and dryer were so delightful with their sing-song end of cycle alert. Overall, the house was quiet, clean and private, not to mention centrally located. All of us felt relaxed coming home to it at the end of the day. It was a great option for us and we will stay here again if we visit Hermiston in the future! Thank you Amber and Shaun!
Cheers,

There were toothbrushes and toothpaste, as well as a 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner. Plenty of towels were provided. The beds were incredibly comfortable, ensuring we got great sleep every night. Although we didn't get a chance to use the hot tub, it was a nice option to have available. Overall, a very pleasant stay."

No privacy and had to keep curtains shut. Also thrown off by offering an additional room (master) not available when we reserved the house and asking for more money to use it. But overall we did enjoy our stay at the house.

Stayed a few nights","Well-furnished place in a fairly quiet subdivision. hosts were fast to respond. All of the amenities were there, except for the body wash, but they were apologetic when we mentioned it.
Unfortunately, the house needed some work in terms of hygiene. There was garbage left over in the kitchen and laundry room trash cans and the window jambs were covered in very thick dust, which was pretty gross to see. There was also a half open box of waffles left in the freezer.
Also, the host had a package delivered while we were there, which was kind of weird. We didn’t know what to do with it, so we just left it on the porch but we didn’t like feeling responsible for somebody else’s mail.
Overall it was fine, but it didn’t feel like the typical super host experience. I think with a deep clean and a little more attention to finishing the cleaning job before check-in would make a huge difference."

Cleaning also included laundry (towels and sheets).
Housekeeping portion of nightly fee was stated as $140 per night.
If that were the case, would highly recommend.
However, one of first signs we see on the wall is “checkout instructions”. Says to do your dishes and laundry before leaving.
Not sure why we would be charged $140 when we do significant cleaning on our end.
In talking to a couple people wondering if our slight dissatisfaction was warranted, both responded that the cleaning fee amount is an issue with airbnb.🤷‍♂️"

We took the kids down to the swimming area a few times and they loved that too. Only hiccup was the deadbolt was locked so we couldn't get in via the code and the outside garbage was full from last renters and very stinky in the heat. Minors things we overcame. Everyone we interacted with regarding the rental was really nice and helpful though."

Stayed with kids","I’ve stayed in AirBnB all over the world. This home was an exceptional find. Close to entertainment, great restaurants, and in a peaceful neighborhood. We really cannot decide what its best features were because it was so great. The kitchen has a beautiful flow with a coffee machine at your fingertips. The bedrooms are ample size with the bathrooms just as accommodating. Some bonuses were; backyard outdoor sitting, comfortable wrap around couch, laundry room, and the use of the garage. It was easy to check in and check out. It was worth the full price."

We were able to cook, wash clothes, and spend time resting in the fenced in backyard when we weren’t busy with our family reunion. The house was located very conveniently to where we needed to be. The beds were very comfortable and it was great having two bathrooms! We would definitely recommend Saira’s place to anyone needing a place to stay!"

Stayed with kids","For being hermiston, it’s nice to have a choice of a house rather than a hotel. They had water bottles in the fridge for us upon arrival which is greatly appreciated. It was a bit chilly in the mornings & evenings so having the fireplace was great.
When getting to the house, the gps hasn’t picked it up yet so make sure you follow her instructions and go around the bend. It stops at the beginning of the neighborhood and won’t get you quite there.
Little things that would’ve been nice are having the towels in the bathrooms so you don’t forget and have the awkward walk to the laundry room. Some extra pillows would’ve been great, & when we came in, if your sensitive like I am, there was a bunch of these plug in scents and it was way too much.
Outside of that the stay is nice. Also worth noting, she does charge an early check in fee if you need it. I’ve stayed at a lot of airbnbs and I’ve never had to pay to get early access. So that was kind of a bummer."

Stayed a few nights","Tara’s place was spacious and was very close to Hermiston which was a plus. The beds were also very comfortable and AC worked amazing. However, I’m a little disappointed that a train nearby wasn’t mentioned as it literally rumbled the entire house and made it hard to sleep through the night. The home didn’t appear to be thoroughly cleaned and only a broom provided. I do feel this place has a lot of potential if more thought an effort are put into it. Also worth mentioning that Tara was flexible with check in and check out and that was very appreciated!"

The bathroom were very clean and the showers had great hot water with decent water pressure. The kitchen was well stocked, with quality cookware, utensils and appliances. We were able to cook full meals with ease. We had no problems during our stay, it was relaxing and enjoyable.
Tara was very accommodating and had great communication the entire time, and I would recommend this property 100%."
