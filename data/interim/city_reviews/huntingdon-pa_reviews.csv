Stayed one night","This place is in a beautiful country setting, almost Paradise! The interior is spacious and spotless. Everything is modern but, at the same time, it also has a cozy, “cabiny” feel.
Due to allergies, I especially appreciate the fact that the home is pet-free.
Brett & Shelly are tremendously nice and communicative hosts. We would stay here again in a heartbeat! And, it’s a great value!!"

Plus the place itself is comfortable and has great style. The space between the living area and bedroom offers lots of privacy with a door, so would work well for two people or even two couples.

Stayed one night","I don't have enough good things to say about our stay! We greatly enjoyed the space of the rustic, yet modern guest house. Having access to the porch from the adjacent house was a very nice amenity and allowed us to see 2 deer and other local wildlife.
Every possible detail was clearly planned and thought out, down to having ice pre-made in the trays before our arrival. The property was isolated, but within a 10 minute drive of Huntingdon for restaurants and entertainment.
I 100%, without hesitation recommend this airbnb to anyone in the area. Incredible value for your money!!"

They also gave us excellent recommendations for local attractions and restaurants, which made our trip even more enjoyable. The house was cozy and nestled in the heart of nature. Although we didn’t use the kitchen, it was fully equipped with everything needed to create a wonderful meal. We were also pleasantly surprised by the thoughtful touches such as snacks, Keurig cups, cozy blankets and a personalized welcome note.
This Airbnb was a hidden gem that provided us with an unforgettable experience! We cannot recommend it highly enough! If our daughter decides to go to Juniata, we will definitely be returning in the future!"

The property is perfect for an outdoor adventurist! We saw deer every day; the river is In walking distance and there is a great trail mowed on the property to walk on and see all kinds of wildlife and flora!! The Allegheny Mountains are within minutes.
If you’re planning a stay for the “Ironstone 100k” this is a perfect destination!! Minutes from Aid Station #4 and very close to all of the aid stations - it will allow your crew the much needed rest time to keep you at your best!!
The property is clean and the hosts are very responsive! I would definitely stay here again if I am in the area."

We also really loved the short walking trail we found in the back yard, the fire pit, the twinkle lights, and peaceful woods on the property.
Julie is so friendly and we were delighted to meet her briefly during our stay. She offered us some tips on sites to see at Juniata College. I also appreciated that she proactively reached out to us a few nights before our stay to provide us with details to know about arriving. Thanks for making us feel so welcome, Julie!

Stayed with kids","Stayed here with 2 adults & 4 kids. Layout was perfect! We loved having 2 bathrooms & appreciated how well stocked the towels & linens were along with the quality of said items! 6 people can use a lot of towels, even when you're being thrifty with your usage.
Kitchen is well stocked, more than most Airbnb's we've stayed at. Pots & pans could use an update but we still had everything we needed to cook for our group - I also understand the challenge of keeping a place stocked with cookware when hundreds of guests per year are using the items.
My most appreciated aspect was the water! We usually bring our own water everywhere we go but after reading other reviews, we took a gamble & didn't lug our crates of water on this trip. I was extremely satisfied! The water is good clean drinking water!
Everything was adequately clean! Thank you for having proper cleaning supplies.
The property is gorgeous with plenty of space for outdoor activities! Love the horseshoe pit!"

Stayed with kids","We had a great stay at Judy and Kevin’s place. The home was bigger than we anticipated, it had plenty of space for everyone to have some quiet, solo time but cozy enough to feel connected throughout the stay. The hosts were very friendly, accommodating and helpful. The outdoor space was awesome for my two kids - a large grassy area to run and play, plenty of outdoor eating space and a fire pit close by. The kitchen was better stocked than most Airbnb’s. There were real pots and pans and great silverware. There is a cute library of dvd’s (with plenty of kids movies). The AC units, coupled with the fans, kept the place nice and cool and provided great white noise at night. The home was clean and well stocked with some household cleaning supplies if needed during your stay (very helpful when you have young kids). Some
Airbnb’s lock these items up, so was very grateful for the access to things like windex and brooms. This was probably my favorite Airbnb stay. The home was perfect. 10/10"

The outdoor fire pit was a fun place to hang out and we appreciated the firewood. Thanks to Judy for her great communication and for meeting us there to explain everything.

Stayed a few nights","I love how easy it was to check in and out of this cabin. That made the travel and packing SO much easier!
The cabin is very cute and just as pictured. The outdoor spaces were absolutely beautiful with the changing leaves.
Pros:
- The cabin has even more space than listed - we had lots of room.
- There aren't many movies but there is a good variety. Same is true for the games, and we enjoyed both.
- Judy was helpful and provided firewood for the firepits. A snafu kept us from using it, but we were really looking forward to it, and wood availability was a big plus.
- The spaces are really comfortable.
Cons:
- The listing appeared to be a bit inaccurate - after talking with Judy upon arrival, it turns out that ACCESS to Raystown Lake is much further away than described. Her shared maps did get us to Trough Creek State Park, but we never made it to Raystown. :-(
- The listing claims pets are forbidden but there are pet dishes in the kitchen. I realize that the owners may simply not want other pets in their space, but that's misleading if you have allergies. Fortunately, my son didn't have severe issues while there, but others could.
- There are a wide variety of dishes and appliances in the kitchen but there's not a dishwasher - and there are mice. We ran out of paper towels because they ate the extra roll and left lots of evidence in the drawers. We ended up avoiding the entire room. I realize that in this rustic, rural setting they may be difficult to keep out, but ... still."

There is no cell service in this area which was both nice and a bit daunting, but they had plenty for us to do including games and movies on the only rainy day we had at the cabin. There were 3 firepits, and they provided plenty of wood for us to use along with 3 different decks and a grill. We had a great time and appreciated that while the neighbors were not right next door, they were close enough in case we needed them. Very family friendly location, and the wildlife is wonderful & active (deer & chipmunks mainly!)"

Stayed with kids","We had an unbelievable time for our family at the cabin. Lovely gated getaway. The cabin was one of the best we every had stayed in. Everything is around 20 minutes or so around the lake each way, some longer distances since we drove out to the main routes instead of the back roads. The shortcut to Trough Creek and other places are off of John Bum Rd. (all gravel and crested). I would recommend something with 4wd or a Subaru or something, but our car was able to make the trip into the community. There are some steeper areas but worth the drive in. There was everything you need. The hosts stocked the cabin with anything you need in the kitchen, anything you need for bedding, and all toiletries and cleaning supplies. Quiet and respectful, just like we were looking for. There are 3 fire pits for any angle of the cabin. The kids loved it, and were delighted with having movies on the flat screen tv there. The grill is all ready for use on the back deck as well. We fell in love with the hummingbirds in the back. They inspected each day when we had our coffee off the back deck. I can't wait until next year. We will stay longer next time. Air conditioning in every room, very nice considering we were in the 90's this week. Again, loved the stay and the hosts were very accommodating. I recommend it highly."

And yes I say everything, because Judy and Kevin surely keeps the cabin well stocked with everything you would need. The only thing you need to bring is some food and clothes. They respect your privacy, but was still close by incase we needed them for anything. They genuinely care about their property and the happiness of the guests that are there.
Judy and Kevin's cabin is clean and cozy! A perfect getaway, for quality time with family and or friends!

A comfortable spot with many thoughtful touches to make it a lovely stay. Plan to bring your groceries and cook in since there is not much around as far as groceries/restaurants; the kitchen is well stocked with cookware and utensils.

This home is an incredibly cute cottage tucked back into the secluded woods setting with an extra sense of security in the gated community. Minimal phone service and WiFi gave us the chance to unplug and spend time together as a family. Spacious enough to comfortably accommodate 6 people, we all slept well in the surprisingly comfortable beds in the home. There are decks off of everything entrance to sit and enjoy your morning of coffee, or just enjoy the great outdoors. We rented a pontoon boat and went tubing at the nearby Raystown lake. I would recommend booking in advance as they do fill up quickly. We walked the thousand steps that is just a short drive from the cottage. We had an amazing time, and would definitely stay here again. I highly recommend!!!"

The cabin was very clean and well stocked! You don't need to bring much with you when you stay here! I look forward to staying here again and seeing what it looks like during different seasons!"

So glad to have an awesome place to stay before our yearly Memorial Day vacation at Raystown Lake. They provide everything you could possibly need and more, and it doesn’t get much better than horseshoes during the day and a campfire at night. The cabin is so cute and comfy and this year we were welcomed by Kevin and a lit gas fire inside due to chilly May weather. Very much appreciate your hospitality- hope to see you again next year!"

Stayed a few nights","Judy and Kevin, Sorry for the delay in getting you my review of your home. I wanted to have time to reply. WOW, Just WOW! For all those out there spending hours and doing weeks of research to find a great location, and home for a ""rustic"" getaway in the country woods of PA...Look no further. I spent weeks looking for just such a spot, all over the Eastern PA, Pocono Mountains and West into Raystown Lake area. I can’t say enough about Judy and Ray’s 3BR, 2BA home nestled in the mountains near Huntingdon, PA. Their home was stocked with everything one needs for a quiet weekend away. Fresh towels, linens and paper supplies were also included. It sleeps 6 easily and the front living room futon is huge and comfy as well. The plate of peanut butter cookies was also a nice touch and didn’t last long. I was there for a guy’s weekend away and we all loved the quiet location and HUGE rock firepits. Outside yard was spacious, even in the woods and had 2 porches/decks to relax on. We even threw some horse shoes in the back yard too. Home was VERY clean. I could find nothing out of place and nothing to complain about, and believe me I am picky. Again, it is not a 5 star hotel, but it’s the perfect “Rustic” home in the woods! One night of rain and we still enjoyed their large TV and supply of DVD movies. If there is a negative at all, there is still no Wi-Fi or Cable in the home, so be prepared to disconnect. Cell reception is very week if any at all. It was odd at first, but was nice again to disconnect from the real world for a few days. Also note, this home is not very close to fishing at Lake Raystown, as it is nearly a 30-45 min drive. We did fish and made the trips, but still not close. Just be aware of that, as I was not. Lastly, I will add that this home is a wonderful VALUE for all they offer! You won’t find a better house for the money. Also, it is quiet and perfect for any couple who want to detach. I can’t wait to come back with my wife, as I’ve already told her all about it. Thanks again Judy and Kevin. Your home is a 10 and I’m just jealous it is not my own. Stay Blessed!"

I have a terribly stressful job as a nurse and all I wanted was quiet and peace, it was provided in your home.
I so loved the space that I want any excuse to come back to it for absolutely no reason at all, just to spend time in the quietness...and run, read, bike, cook in the lovely little kitchen, drink coffee and watch the deer come into the front yard, pick raspberries and just breathe.
We will be back or maybe just me!
All of us, even the twenty year old and fourteen year old with spotty cell service🙄, we loved it!
They loved playing games, cards and eating yummy food.
I recommend it highly, cozy, comfortable and relaxing."

Stayed with kids","Let me just start off by saying that this was definitely a gem hidden on the mountain. this was a perfect getaway where cell phone coverage was minimal there was no satellite or digital TV and no Wi-Fi for everybody to be hooked on. There are so many attractions within the area including the caverns and park areas, and places to go kayaking etc etc. It was a perfect getaway and this place was absolutely amazing. The home was better than what the pictures showed and exceeded our expectations. The little touch of muffins on our first morning there was perfect and made us feel like we were in a beautiful b&b. The view was absolutely amazing and although there were neighbors in this tiny cul-de-sac hidden away. Most of them looked to be cabins and nobody was there during that time. The homes are spaced far enough apart that you have your own privacy. Everything was clean and wonderful extra linen and pillows. All the amenities were wonderful and everything was exactly what we had hoped for and then some. I cannot say enough for how wonderful our stay was other than the fact that we will most definitely be coming back again for years to come I hope. Thank you Judy and Kevin for a wonderful stay that my little family absolutely loved."

Communication and check-in went smoothly, Kevin and Judy met us at the gated entrance to the street that the cabin is on. Its important to note that this cabin barely gets cell reception and is not equipped with wi-fi, which was perfect for our weekend escape. Bring a book and play some games- there are board games and horseshoes on site. We also brought our cornhole game since there is ample backyard space to play! The fire pits were so much fun for hanging around the campfire and making s'mores. The cabin was also well stocked with kitchen items (utensils, paper towels, plates, coffee makrer etc.) so all we needed to do was bring food and beverages. The cabin is about a 30-40 min drive from 7 Points Marina on the other side of Raystown Lake. We spent the day there and rented a pontoon boat-- HIGHLY recommend this as something fun to do in the area!!"

We were able to spend lazy mornings there watching movies and playing board games, and our afternoons exploring Raystown Lake. We were even able to roast marshmallows one evening over a bonfire after spending the day swimming at the beach. Something we could never do at home in Illinois due to the heat in July.

Stayed a few nights","My family and I recieved a warm welcome from Judy. She gave us a tour of the cabin and local suggestions. There were tasty muffins left on the kitchen counter for us and the cabin was so clean and comfortable. I was expecting a few spiders and such as we were on the middle of the woods, but I hardly saw any critters during my 2 night stay, maybe 3 black ants total. Although there was no central air, there were lots of ceiling fans and the house stayed a comfortable temperature. This is coming for someone who's thermostat stays at 66 degrees in the summer. I will say this, if you have T-mobile don't expect to have any contact with the outside world electronically during your stay. Other than that, it was awesome! We'll definitely be back!"

We ventured out to Raystown Lake, but it was so rainy and chilly, we couldn't wait to get back to our warm cozy cabin in the woods. We had a wonderful weekend! Thank you so much!"

Kitchen had everything we needed, and everything was very clean. The outside is lovely with nice decks to sit out on and fire pits. We visited Raystown Lake and Trough Creek Park, which are both amazing with incredible hikes. We ate at Tops Diner for breakfast which was awesome, huge servings, especially of meats and pancakes... definitely recommend the sweet potato cakes. Also got pizza at the Deli place across the street from the Diner and that was yummy, too. Never thought I'd find such gems in a remote area."

The cabin was immaculate having every amenity you would need for cooking and personal needs, including a closet full of games and movies to firewood for the fire pits. It was great being at this perfect secluded place away from all the crowds but still being able to easily get to hiking, biking and Raystown Lake to enjoy the area. It was a much needed get away to relax which we did!! We hope to return to this cabin again in the future. Thank you, Kevin and Judy!!"

Stayed a few nights","Wow! This place was awesome. My partner went to Juniata College and we usually stay at Raystown Lake for the holiday. We decided to book Stephanie’s place and it did not disappoint. The place is in such a beautiful location. The balcony views are amazing. Coffee and tea plus breakfast from the balcony is a must. The binoculars were an added touch to help us look at birds and stars when we were out there. We didn’t end up using the tubes but I could tell it would be an awesome time on the water. Aside from the beautiful scenery and location, the studio itself is so cozy. We loved the large kitchen to make breakfast. Stephanie left us such nice gifts along with farm fresh eggs, butter, coffee, tea and a ton of other small cooking items. The window views from inside the studio is also a nice bonus to enjoy the nature around you. This spot was so close to everything in Huntingdon & Raystown. Fabulous host & space! Highly recommend this spot. We will be back again."

Stayed a few nights","The Riverside Retreat was the perfect spot to land - quiet, well-appointed, space indoors and outdoors for relaxing. Stephanie's personal touches are spot on - guest book with menus and recreation ideas, Netflix-enabled tv, usb charging plugs on each side of the bed (I hate having to search for outlets when I travel and these already had the built-in!), extra cables, in-room laundry, a welcome gift of snacks and eggs! Stephanie was incredibly responsive and flexible to my travel needs and reached out to ask if I needed anything for my stay. I'll certainly look to stay again in the future for either work or fun. Things to know: 1) there is a pretty active train line immediately across the levee/river (you will also hear this train if you stay at the local hotel up the street) and 2) space for storing luggage is limited if traveling with more than one person."

When we are in the area the unit is in a good central location as I needed to visit towns between Altoona and Lewistown. I enjoy the walkability of the area as well. If you are in town over Sunday or Monday when restaurant options are slim, it's nice to have the option of preparing your own dinner in the little kitchen and eating it at the kitchen table or on the pretty porch overlooking the Juniata River."

Great host. Very kind and responsive, socked with a lot of extras, coffee was great. I found another piece of evidence that I'm on the right path in my life. The owner and I made a serendipitous book exchange. Stephanie and this place are now a part of my path in my wake of my wave im riding. I'm on my right path.

The outdoor space on the porch is a peaceful spot to rest in the afternoon with a glass or cup of something soothing.

Stayed a few nights","The bedroom/living room was a little hot for our stay. The AC did not make it to the bedroom.I’m giving 4 stars It would be 3.5 if I could. Clean, nice countertop in kitchen, nice double sink bathroom. Mattress was very comfy. River and grocery-store access onlyminutes away. Has a nice deck and grill area with cute string lights. There’s only one door protecting you fromoutside and it’s the sliding door on deck with only a small latch. Did not feel completely safe."

There are so many smart touches: several times I thought, “I wish I had [insert object]”, and then I turned around and there it was! We immediately felt relaxed and relieved with the cool, cozy, and clean decor. We loved our serene morning coffees on the porch, watching the river and listening to the trains. It’s really such a gem location in a great area! Stephanie’s recommendation book had all of Huntingdon’s best hits. We were sad to leave but look forward to staying again in the future!"

Stayed one night","Let's start from the beginning of our trip. The check in process was so simple. The host gives you step by step instructions on how to get in and has pictures. You walk into a beautiful apartment over looking the river. The apartment is completely redone with beautiful (and comfortable) furniture. The kitchen has a ton of space for just whoever is staying or if you would like to host people. The entire apartment was super clean and hospitable. There were tons of amenities that we didn't even realize we might need! Coffee, tea, ice cubes, board games, books, fishing poles, etc. There's a grill outside that invites such a nice outside vibe for your trip. The TV was a great addition if you want to stay in and it swivels to face the seating area or your bed. There was a washer and dryer if you needed it as well. Really like the option of having more beds if needed as well to again have more guests. Got to wake up this morning and have a complimentary coffee on the deck over looking the river. 12/10 and would recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay in Huntingdon.
PS the host has great recommendations of what to do in town as well as where to eat- definitely take their advice!"

Loved being within walking distance to several parks and to town. Check in and out was easy and added bonuses made us smile and feel very welcomed upon our arrival. Highly recommended!

I enjoyed all the games available, some that I hadn't played since childhood. They even had an Atari set up in one of the bedrooms!!! the bathroom had extra amenities and the outside had all the tools for the fire and they provided s'mores. such a great place to get away and recharge yourself.

Stayed a few nights","Steve and Diane's place was a perfect home base for a weekend of biking and hiking. I booked it knowing their house was a bit further away from the Allegprippis (Raystown Lake) trail system than some of the other listings, but their house was much cleaner and better updated so it was worth the little bit of extra time driving to the trails. The house has a lot of privacy and some great views, especially at sunset.
As the description notes, there's no wifi - and cell service is good enough for a call but not streaming. We actually made that part of the fun by bringing a bunch of old DVDs and doing movie nights. Bonus: I was actually able to get my kids to watch a bunch of my favorite movies that they would have had no interest in when they've got access to Netflix/Disney/etc.
We definitely enjoyed our stay and would book again!"

We were about a 20 minute drive or so from the lake. Close to lots of great hiking spots. One of the bedrooms is a loft upstairs which is super cool - but doesn't have a door for privacy/noise.

Everything you could need for cooking is included and there were more than enough towels, pillows, etc. The cabin was larger than we anticipated. One note, especially if you’re traveling with small children, is the largest of the bedrooms is in the open loft space. The area was private and peaceful with the exception of some mooing at the nearby farm, which my kids got a kick out of. There were a handful of little restaurants nearby and lots to do in the state park. Seven points marina was a little further away but an easy drive."

Stayed a few nights","This was our first ever stay at an AirBNB. I was slightly nervous having heard some stories of bad experiences but the hosts were phenomenal and the property was amazing! For the price of a small hotel room you get an entire house in a gorgeous setting. Our dogs loved it too! The view from the master bed room out the front windows was just amazing. The bed was comfortable to us. Sitting on the covered porch was very relaxing. The leaves were just starting to change during our stay. I can only imagine how awesome and awe inspiring it would look as it approaches peak colors. The house is well stocked, clean, in good repair, and very comfortable. I felt at home, comfortable, and relaxed very quickly! Steve welcomed us. He was very friendly and told us to let them know if we needed anything. Our phones didn’t work and that was a welcome forced unplug. We spent a good portion of Sunday on the porch and let the dogs explore the yard. A minor thing, there is a pig farm nearby that if the wind blows in a specific direction it can be smelled but it didn’t last long."

The cabin is nicely positioned in a secluded area just outside of Calvin on top of a hill overlooking the forest and surrounding farmland (with plenty of space for the kids to run around - they loved the hill in the front). We enjoyed the evenings on the front porch overlooking the valley and sunset or sitting around the fire pit (the firewood is also provided). The house was very clean inside with just about everything provided, including a scrapbook with things to do and places to eat in the area (OIP has the best strombolis). The owners are very nice people who promptly respond to questions and even visited us on our first evening to check if we needed anything, which is just above and beyond. Thank you so much for providing us a great place to stay for our weekend getaway!"

We cooked many breakfasts and one dinner in the well appointed kitchen, and we loved the nice laundry facilities. It was so peaceful and pretty on the property - we loved sitting on the front porch and walking our dogs. Great star gazing on clear nights too. Diane and Steve are warm and welcoming; they responded back immediately to any messages I sent and helped to accommodate my family’s time schedules. We enjoyed boating on Raystown Lake, taking the kids to Lincoln Caverns, and attending a nearby family reunion. I absolutely recommend this property to anyone looking for quality time with loved ones in a beautiful location."

Gary built this cabin strictly for his family many years ago without (Us) in mind, so grateful to be able to enjoy their labors of love.
Its location and view will leave you speechless upon arrival. Morning coffee on the porch was elevating, walking our dogs on his pathways felt like home.
Can't say enough about our host Gary, friendly, very communicative and accommodating. Thank you Gary for allowing my family to stay at your cabin. Looking forward to our next stay - what a privilege.

Stayed with a pet","We cannot recommend this cabin enough! We had the most relaxing stay, the cabin was clean and cozy and the views were spectacular!
We had one clear day and one rainy day—we explored some local parks and trails on our nice day and Gary gave some great recommendation. We stargazed in the hot tub and by the fire, it was so clear! We saw a few shooting stars, too.
Our rainy day was the best vacation rainy day I’ve ever had— we cozied up by the fire and read books and played board games. When we got a break in the rain we would sit in the hot tub and watch the clouds and fog roll over the mountains.
And I can’t gush about the cabin without a very glowing review of the host— Gary is above and beyond the most welcoming AirBnb host we’ve ever had! I had such a wonderful time getting to know him and learning about Irish Acres. It really is such a special place— we’ve been raving to all of our friends and are already scheming our return! Thank you for making our weekend getaway so special!"

Stayed with a pet","Gary’s Irish Acres Cabin is what dreams are made of! His special slice of Heaven was one of the top places we’ve ever stayed in. We found Gary’s cabin because we were looking for a serene getaway to enjoy the fall foliage. It was incredibly freeing and peaceful and to stay on top of the mountains and be among the breathtaking scenery. We absolutely loved the hot tub and enjoyed the rolling hills while enjoying the rolling bubbles of the spa. We enjoyed swinging on the porch swing at all times of the day, and especially under the stars at night. We went to Hawk Watch mountain to hike and enjoyed seeing hawks at eye level. We toured Belleville and found various farm stands with delicious fruits and vegetables. Gary’s cabin was extremely clean but what was most impressive was that he and his friends and family built the cabin with love and devotion. We are honored to have met Gary and be guests in his home. We left feeling more like family and we can’t wait to go back!"

Stayed with a pet","My wife, pup, and I were lucky enough to book Eugene's (""Gary's"") property for a Fall college football weekend. While things didn't go our way on the football field, this cabin was a convenient (<30min) and beautiful contrast to the craziness of State College. Perched high atop a hill with complete privacy (aside from many deer!), Gary's property only recently became available on AirBNB after many years as a family cabin -- the family photos and history only add to the charm. While rustic, the cabin is as-described, clean, and has all the basic creature comforts. Outside, the porch swing, hot tub, fire pit, and horseshoes complement the awesome views. Each morning, we awoke to fog nestled in the valley below. Our only regret is that our weekend agenda consisted of too much of tailgating in parking lots -- and not enough relaxing back at the AirBNB."

Stayed one night","Absolutely stunning and comfortabe home. Interior design and furnishings could be featured in a magazine. Each of the three bedrooms are spacious and unique.
We spent a good bit of time just admiring the gorgeous wallpaper and window treatments. The bedding was not only beautiful but supremely comfortable. I had to do some work on the computer and attend a remote meeting and the wifi was great, and there were flat screen TVs in each bedroom and in the living room, which we didn’t use but looked like they are high quality. The cafe just across the street is amazing- they roast their own delicious coffee and serve breakfast and lunch items (and yummy smoothies!) with a very nice sit down area. We enjoyed walking around and looking at the older homes in the neighborhood. There are a number of good restaurants a short 3-4 min drive away (.8 mile). Can’t recommend this stay enough! We hope to have the good fortune to stay again soon."

Stayed with a pet","Jeannie and Herb’s place was good for a night passing through. Pretty view of the farm and cows. House has everything you need and the porch was great to watch the sunset. The only negative thing is that when I arrived their very large dog ran over to my car, jumped on my door and stuck his nose in trying to get to my dog. The following morning he was let out into the yard while I was walking my dog on leash and again ran right up on her. Luckily my dog is not reactive and I was able to keep the situations under control, but anyone that has a reactive dog should be extremely guarded and protective of their dog. Other than that, it was a pleasant stay."

It's near Rothrock State Forest, Canoe Creek State Park, Alexandria PA and the Lower Trail. Communication with the host is always fast and very pleasant. check in is as easy as could be. This Airbnb is apartment sized, with fully equipped kitchen and three bedrooms, one with a queen bed, and two bedrooms with two twins each. Board games, cable TV, decent Wi-Fi, and watching the farm animals, made our stay extra enjoyable! Thank you for a wonderful stay!"

The farm location is quiet and feels safe and remote, with a few restaurants just two to three miles away. The Lower bike trail is only 2 mi away. The space has all the essentials, is clean and cozy. it's so roomy, I had the feeling a family of four could actually live here full time. I appreciated having a full kitchen and everything needed to make a good cup of coffee. it was really delightful watching the farm animals from the porch, as I sipped morning coffee. The hosts went above and beyond at checkout, going out of their way to help with a last detail. I have stayed at many airbnbs all over the country, this one is not elaborate or fancy but makes up for it with country charm and gracious hosts! Thank you for a wonderful stay!"

We messaged the host to ask for permission to use the fire pit and we were given a quick reply that yes, we could. They even gave us treats to feed the cows. Such a fun experience. I did take one star off because I found several spiders inside the apartment during our stay. I understand it’s the country, but nothing a quick pest spray wouldn’t fix. Overall great experience, and would stay again!"

Stayed with a pet","This apartment is just as pictured, only much better! It is impeccably clean, well-stocked with necessities, and in a quiet, peaceful location.
Indoors: Two of the three bedrooms have no windows, which made them wonderfully dark for sleeping. We used only two beds; the queen in the master has a memory foam mattress and is very comfortable. My son (17) slept in one of the twin beds and said that it was, ""springy, but comfortable."" (He has a memory foam mattress at home, so this was different.) All three bedrooms have dressers with plenty of drawer space, as well as extra blankets and pillows.
The kitchen was well-supplied with everything needed to cook and serve a meal. Coffee, dish soap, sponge, and dish towels are all provided. The bathroom is huge, and had more than enough towels. Sofa and loveseat in the living room were comfortable for lounging on a quiet day. Dining room table easily sits six people.
The air conditioning comes from two window units on the opposite side of the apartment from the bedrooms but kept us cool enough for sleeping, even on 85 degree days. We turned them off during the day, because the apartment was comfortable without them.
On a couple of evenings, we smelled cigarette smoke in the master bedroom. We speculated that the hosts might have been smoking either upstairs or on the front porch, and the smell came in to us. Other than that (and it was neither nightly, nor heavy), we have no complaints or concerns.
Outdoors: We appreciated the pet-friendly property. We loved the fire ring, and the plentiful supply of firewood. It was beautiful to sit beside the fire, watch the fireflies, and see the cows come home to the barn for the night."

As someone with allergies, this was a lot to take. Further, we got in late at night and woke up to Trump flags flying high on the property.

Stayed about a week","WOW! Fantastic place to stay. The pictures dont do the space justice. One main bedroom with Queen bed, and two other bedrooms with two twins each. Spacious eat in kitchen and cookware for making your own meals. Living room is spacious and affords tv for relaxation. I am not much on watching tv but seemed a fair amount of channels offered. WiFi was excellent for my needs. I dont stream videos so can't comment on speed of internet. I have Verizon cell and found no issue with cell service during my lengthy stay.
Large bathroom with enough towels for an army. The apartment is under the host's home but that presented no issues whatsoever. In fact the benefits of having Herb and Jeannie nearby was an added bonus. I actually stayed seven full weeks. Felt like home. At this location you are 8 miles to Huntingdon - grocery stores and eateries and playgrounds. You are also close to hiking the Lower Trail 4 miles away. Or drive 28 miles to downtown State College Pa which offers nightlife, sports venues (PennState) and several museums. This rental is in a country setting and ad states ""suv recommended""; heed that warning in Pennsylvania winters. I have an suv and had no issues with access to apartment but also Herb was on top of plowing and dealing with the ice storm fallout. The property is home of the Belted Galloway cows. Goregous view from kitchen window. Dont hesitate to walk the pasture lane to witness these creatures up close. An added bonus to this rental is the collection of games, puzzles, and reading material. Something for all age groups. Isaac and I loved the assortment! Don't hesitate to rent this space. There is much to be appreciated.
Looking forward to my next visit."

Stayed with kids","Don't hesitate to stay at this lovely, comfortable apartment in Alexandria. From the moment I reserved the space Jeannie reached out to give great detail as to location and specific information regarding access on winter roads to the apartment. Herb had driveway plowed and treated with cinders. The ad states a 4 wheel drive is suggested. During my stay we have been hit with two ice storms and brutally cold temps. I was glad to have an suv with 4 wheel drive.
The apartment is located in the country. It is a full living space under the host's home. This has only been a positive experience. A few things I needed, Herb was quick to respond and assisted me in a warm friendly manner. My three k9s have been welcomed as well; not many places allow more than one dog. The apartment kitchen window faces a large pasture on side hill, the view offered some fantastic sunsets. The pasture is home to Registered Belted Galloway cows. The pasture is surrounded by a lane which is accessible to the guest, good workout to crest the hill. View is breathtaking. GOREGOUS! My stay had had been for six weeks straight. Cant say enough how comfortable I was. Safe environment and quiet. Dont pass up a chance to rent this lovely apartment."

Stayed a few nights","This is a great place to stay! It is of great value, and it can actually host 5 people! It is exactly the place you want if you are here for the football games!
It is cozy, and everything is clean and nice. You can find all the things you need.
It is in a farm, so you might find some bugs but only very few especially considering you are at a farm!
It is also expected that the Internet is not very good. It is even hard to load photos. My ATT almost does not work, so make sure you get your navigation app working before you leave the house. This is typical of Airbnb houses according to my experience.
Another thing we would like to mention is that they have giant dogs! However, you won't feel their existence at all if you do not ask for a visit to Jeannie, so no worries if you do not want to see any dogs. We are interested so we paid a visit and that is a fun experience!
Generally, I like this place a lot, and it is not too far from the football game!

Stayed with kids","Great place to stay! After our other airbnb cancelled on us the day before our trip due to a bridge outage from storms which made it unsafe to access the airbnb, we were left scrambling to find a place to accommodate us and our 3 small children in this somewhat remote area. We found Jeannie and Herb's place and booked it immediately. I was a little worried about the drive since my husband was taking a class in Belleville and I needed to be able to drive him back and forth from his class. While it was 35 minutes away from where we wanted to stay, it was still a manageable drive, especially relatively close to huntingdon, which is where I ended up spending a lot of time with the kids while we waited for the class to be finished each day.
Every was as described, very spacious accommodations. Unfortunately this was the first time we tried to get our 18 month old to sleep in a pack n play instead of his crib and it did not go well and I worried that we were disturbing our hosts as our little guy refused to acknowledge bed time and alternatively fussed and tried to play/wouldnt fall asleep until late! Kids were very upset when we had to leave and keep asking to go back to our ""other"" house."

Stayed over a week",Perfect spot to unwind out in the country! Sitting on the back porch listening to the rooster crow and watching the sun come up was the therapy we needed! A little home away from home with super nice hosts available for any needs. Highly recommend!

Stayed one night","What a great find. This place has everything thing you need for spending time in the great outdoors. Very spacious, super clean, all the amenities necessary for a comfortable stay. The views are incredible from the back porch and nothing like enjoying breakfast with the belted galloways! Thank you so much for making your place available. I will definitely be back!
