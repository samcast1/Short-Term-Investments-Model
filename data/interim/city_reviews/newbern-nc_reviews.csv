Stayed a few nights",We loved our stay! The check in instructions were very clear and it was easy to find the space. We had plenty of room and the place was very clean! Everything we wanted to do was walking distance from the location so it worked perfectly. Would recommend and hopefully will be staying again!

Stayed a few nights","Maria's place was better than pictured, and one of the better airbnbs we've stayed in. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go, and when it was too wet to go out, we enjoyed listening to the sound of the rain from inside. We had everything we needed, loved our time in New Bern, and look forward to staying at Maria's place again!"

Stayed a few nights","Perfect spot for exploring New Bern and surrounding areas. You can walk to all of the downtown area restaurants, shopping and points of interest. Great location if you are looking to ditch your car and walk everywhere. The apartment is in a historic building above a downtown business but I heard no noise from downstairs. High ceilings and wood floors. The kitchen is fully equipped with everything you could need and some things you didn't know you needed (even a crockpot!). Foil, wax paper, cling wrap and various Tupperware containers. Bakeware, cookware and utensils look new. The kitchen was SPOTLESS. The bathrooms SPOTLESS. The bed linens were dreamy and the bed firm but very comfortable. Great light and energy. Washer and dryer were not smelly, again SPOTLESS. This is a clean, safe and comfortable place. I would definitely stay here again. Thank you Maria! 😊🙏"

It’s a cute upstairs apartment within a short walking distance to all the wonderful restaurants and shops. You get a private assigned parking spot that is just steps from the door. Maria was very responsive although we had no issues and did not need anything during our stay! If you are looking for a stay that is clean, spacious and in a great location, THIS apartment is it!"

Stayed a few nights","Our stay was really great. It was everything we were hoping for - close to restaurants that we wanted to explore and near the convention center. The keypad check-in made both check-in and check-out a breeze. The bed was comfy and the kitchen had coffee (always a necessity) but there were also the little things like q-tips and the make-up wash rag....
Maria was also wonderful at the end of our visit to clear up a situation that saved us some money. I don't know if anyone else would have went the extra mile like she did. We highly recommend this location to anyone wanting a great experience exploring New Bern or just to have a home-like atmosphere for events at the convention center."

Although it is noted in the listing, I didn’t focus on the fact that you need to carry your suitcase up 20 stairs on the external staircase. I managed just fine, but it could be an issue for others.
I had a lovely stay, and enjoyed New Bern."

The location is a little further from downtown New Bern, but you can get there in about 10-15 minutes and there are other places to eat and a number of grocery stores that are even closer.
Overall, this was a great place to call home for a few days."

Well, you will not find a better square footage per dollar than Brenda's place on Airbnb. Furthermore everything you could possibly need is there. You could live there for a year. I think I want to. Quiet, peaceful, comfortable and well furnished. What else does one need?? Do not, I repeat, do not hesitate to rent this unit. You will not be disappointed but rather you will wish you stayed longer!"

The place was pristine with plenty of windows for natural light and very quiet. It’s clear Brenda has put a lot of care and attention to making sure we had a wonderful and peaceful weekend. Downtown New Bern was just a few minutes away. Highly recommend Brenda’s place to anyone and we will certainly be back.

It was a relaxing stay and I wish I could have had a few more days, lol. Brenda was very nice and helpful, and very responsive. :)
It was the perfect distance from downtown New “Bear”… quick and easy to get to and I loved driving over the river on those bridges. I don’t think I ever realized just how expansive the Neuse River is!!
If you get the chance, go to Bicentennial Park or Union Park. Both are riverfront and have a sidewalk that’s a good little workout - plus breezes, views, and sounds from the river. It’s well worth it!"

Brenda is the best host too. Providing anything you might need plus snacks drinks, extra things. You could literally just bring some clothes and be good to stay there. I always bring towels and washclothes because I hate using someone else's but honestly those were the cleanest looking towels and washclothes I have ever seen. I would HIGHLY recommend Brenda's place. She even put out some stuffed animals on a chair that my daughter loved. She definitely knows how to treat guest! Above and beyond expectations! This home has a special feel to it like if your extra clean Grandmaw had a guest home and wanted you to feel as welcome as possible. Thats the best way I can describe it. Thank you Brenda!"

Being from Houston Texas 1500 miles away I felt right at home when I arrived at her home. Her and her husband were very hospitable and understanding. Great place to call home away from home.

Shopping and restaurants are a bit far but DoorDash delivers. Bring what you need or 10 min drive back into town. Worth it for the beautiful, peaceful location. Just not walking distance to anything.

Stayed one night","This is a hidden gem. Everything you could need is there, but more. We were welcomed by a herd of deer and then a battery operated candle was lit on the table. This little home was comfy and charming, right down to children’s books in the cabinet and playing cards and Halloween candy. Little notes left by the host keep you well informed. Brenda was quick to respond and gracious. Apparently she has thought of everything. There were ample towels and everything was spotlessly clean. Who wouldn’t love caramel creamer for your morning coffee? But if you prefer tea, there’s a tea bag plate there for you and a selection of sweetener. The orange juice, water bottles and snack basket with bananas was a treat.
The Firestick on the TV offered a great selection. We chose to play music that filled the cottage, but the main house was enough of a distance that we knew we weren’t disturbing them. The bed had just enough firmness for a great nights sleep and the pillows were perfect. We wish we could stay, but will certainly be back!"

Stayed with kids","Loved this place. Definitely a place where you say, ""Next time we go back to New Bern, we need to stay here!"" It is right downtown so you can walk everywhere easily. Loved having a reserved parking spot. Small thing, but there was soap and a sponge to wash dishes. So many Air BnBs have dishes but don't provide a way to clean them. My only note is the place is little echo-y. My wife has a hearing impairment so the echo made it a little difficult to communicate across the room. Not a big deal at all, but I felt worth noting if that is a consideration of yours. It is also located around businesses so there is a little noise from that, but minor and was never bothersome. Overall, great location, clean, great price, with just the right amenities you need for a stay. Highly recommend to anyone; we will be staying here again!"

The area was quiet and the parking space was feet from the door; we never needed to move our car during our stay because everything was within walking distance of the apartment. Would definitely recommend this place!

Stayed with kids","Cute AirBnB tucked away in the middle of downtown New Bern. Apartment was very spacious, had everything we needed, and even had two rooms that separated the shower and sink/toilet, which was actually pretty convenient! You can walk everywhere in downtown because it’s all right there. Highly recommend Bella’s Cafe next door as well as Big E’s food truck (chili dogs) that parked right outside our door for two nights, delicious! Host was very responsive and friendly.
Some things to note: There is a bar right there by the apartment and sometimes people would sit out in the patio area at night and we could hear them a little late but nothing that kept us up or was bothersome. What did wake us up at 4am, however, was the garbage truck. But that only happened one morning. Otherwise, the place was great and I recommend as a nice stay in New Bern"

Nice to have dedicated parking a few feet from the unit's door. Be aware that the unit faces a parking lot behind several restaurants and businesses - and there was some noise in the evenings and very early morning - typical for these kinds of businesses. Definitely not a deal breaker for us.

Stayed a few nights","We loved this space and the amenities. So cozy. Loved being able to walk 2 steps over to the local cafe/coffee shop in the morning for breakfast and coffee.
My only suggestions-
In the check-in instructions be sure to add that the entrance is on the back side of the building. Also, add that there is a parking pass on the table inside that you need to put in your car. Things that we figured out, but would have been nice to know to make arrival a little easier.
The parking lot light shines right through the window above the entry door and reflects the address number on the wall by the bed. For us, it was just a little too much light shining in on us. There are plenty of throw pillows though, so we covered the window the second night with those.
Both very minor things and not at all game changers.
Thank you for such a fantastic stay and accommodations! I’ve already told so many people about your space. 😀"

The house itself is clean with lots of open space and a very comfortable couch. There is a large, fenced-in backyard for your dog or children to play and be safe."

Group trip","I needed a place for my family that came out of town to stay for the weekend, to attend our baby gender reveal. We did not have a lot of time to go out due to having to prepare food, other things for the celebration and did not want to be on the road too much. The only time we left the home was to go to the store, eat-in lunch, and on the day of the event. Johns place was perfect for spending the weekend in because there was plenty of space in the living room for us to hang out and play games, the outdoors were beautiful and had a variety of patio seating and the walk to the waterfront was scenic and peaceful. The property was clean inside/out and there were extra towels, pillows, and blankets provided if needed. John even lit a bonfire for my guests & I, unfortunately I did not see his message until the next day. Overall, it was a memorable and unforgettable stay and we would happily visit again."

Stayed with a pet","I can't say enough about this place! This house is THE perfect spot for a weekend getaway or week vacation with family or friends. Relax on the beach, watch the sunrise, lay in the hammock, sit by the fire pit, .... take it all in. There are 2 other houses on the property so if you need more room for larger crowd, check out those listings too. My dog loved the fenced in back yard and I didn't have to worry about him. The home is only a quick 8 minute drive to downtown New Bern and 30-40 min drive to Emerald Isle. I highly recommend eating at Cypress Hall, MJs, Lawson's Creek, and Sea & Soul. I spent an entire day in New Bern - shopped (all located on Middle & Craven Streets), walked the historic district & water front. I also loved the animals on property. This hidden gem feels like being at the mountains, the river and farm all in one. John is a great host, quick to respond. I will be back!"

We were in town for my daughter's wedding on Saturday and a family birthday breakfast the next day and weren't sure how many people would need a place to sleep for the weekend nor how quickly we would be able to check out on Sunday. John was super easy to work with and we had a fabulous weekend. The animals at the location are so much fun and since we were getting up earlyish each morning we didn't mind the roosters. If you are coming to sleep in, you might want to bring bring earplugs. 😂"

Stayed with kids","This was our 4th year in a row at John’s property and it won’t be our last. In past years we have enjoyed the private beach, grilling, sitting out on the dock, and watching our kids endlessly kayak around. This year we changed it up and went down to the ocean beach at Pine Knoll Shores for a day and another day rented some kayaks in Cedar Point to go out on the salt marsh. It was fun discovering even more nearby activities! His location is just fantastic from the property itself, to New Bern being right there, and the ocean only 45 minutes away.
John has 3 houses on the property he rents out (which are nicely spaced out and landscaped for privacy) and we love that Dot’s Spot is positioned right across from the goats, chickens, ducks and emus. Nothing like drinking your morning cup of coffee watching the animals and then meandering down to the dock on the water! PS- I am allergic to dogs but have never had an issue staying in any of his houses. Very clean. Highly recommend his place!"

We were able to have a campfire on the beach every night, we fished (only caught small fish - bait is very hard to find in the area!), and we were able to use the grills on the property and the kayaks. Lots of fun things to do and incredibly beautiful views! The only thing we were concerned about was the amount of broken glass on the beach. Make sure you have water shoes and be careful walking your dogs by the water. Other than that, the place was perfect and we made some wonderful memories."

There are 3 houses on the site, but each is quite distant from the others, so very intimate. Finally, there are even animals, the kids loved it. We were about 55 minutes from the sea, so often we spent a few hours at the sea to come back and enjoy John's location. Thank you ☺️"

It's an older house but has been remodeled nicely. The kitchen was great and had everything you could need. The fenced in yard was a plus for our dog. The location provided plenty of privacy but was still in close proximity to stores, restaurants, and downtown. The only con about the house is that it did have a noticeable musty smell throughout. Other than that, John's place was very functional for the week we were there. Would recommend!"

We loved staying at Dot’s Spot this time- the big open kitchen/dining/living area was perfect for hosting our friends who rented the 40s cottage the same weekend we were there. It’s awesome that he has 3 houses for rent on the property! The place was clean and comfortable and even though he allows dogs (and I am allergic) I’ve never had any allergy issues or even seen any dog hair really. The beach is spacious, perfect gradual slope in the water (ideal for kids), and we love the new dock that extends out with a bench overlooking the water. Always a highlight of our year!"

Things to be aware of: There are no curtains/blinds in any common areas of the house, so it does feel exposed at night. Also, if you’re cooking for a crowd (more than two) you’ll need to bring some of your own kitchen supplies (big pot, 9 x 13 pan, large skillet, etc.).
Those things didn’t deter us from having a great weekend getaway, just something to be aware of! Overall this was a great little spot."

His property is very dog friendly with a fenced yard and hardwood floors. Having coffee in the mornings at the sand beach by the water was a special treat . The hospitality of the folks in New Bern makes it a great place to visit.

Stayed a few nights","Dot’s Spot was a great getaway. Very quiet nestled back in the woods off of the road. There are two other cottages that can be rented on the same property if you’re a larger group.
The property includes a pier and a private beach for relaxing and bonfires.
The kitchen has the basics of pots and pans, silverware, and cooking utensils both for inside and for the gas grill outside.
The owner John was very helpful and responsive with any questions and is nearby should you need anything, but stayed out of sight.
Overall a comfortable and relaxing space that is well cared for and a very good value."

Group trip",This was such an easy and great place to stay while we were in New Bern! The house is easy to find with plenty of parking for a couple of cars. The house was bright and updated and very clean. The one thing we found a bit lacking was the linens. There were only three bath towels for the entire house (and 6 guests) and the bedding was minimal and definitely for warmer temps. We had a bit of a cold snap while there and the house didn't get warmer than 65 so we were definitely chilly at night. But it was still a great stay and we'll happily be back. Having the back yard for our dog was also wonderful!

Stayed a few nights","We had a fantastic stay at John’s place. The house is very big inside, very clean, and has a large fenced in yard.
We were able to enjoy the water on the private beach area for lounging and fishing and even get the kayaks out for a ride. Our dog also felt very at home and was able to enjoy our vacation with us.
My elderly mom went with us and we were able to access the home easily and the beach area with her wheelchair.
If you’re looking for a quiet place to enjoy the outdoors and relax, this is the place.
John was a great host and responds quickly to any questions.
With the 3 houses on the property it would be a great place for a family trip."

Stayed with kids","Dot's Place is a wonderful renovation of a 1940's -era home. John has kept the character of the home with the original real wood floors and doors, while updating the home with modern conveniences & style. The home is spacious enough for 6 people, but intimate enough for a smaller group. However, the biggest win for us over the Independence Day 2021 holiday was the beach - private, warm & shallow water (4ft deep out to 30 yards) for the kids, and calm! The fire pit, kayaks, and fishing dock were extra bonuses - an amazing time was had by all!"

The property was absolutely gorgeous and offered so much for our family to do. John made us feel welcome and had excellent communication. You can tell that he has poured his heart and soul into this property and it’s upkeep. We loved that we could bring our golden retriever and he had lots of room to run and play as well as a fenced in yard. The private beach was so beautiful and we loved that it was only a few steps from the house. John has thought of everything, right down to sand toys for the little ones. We will definitely be back again and we cannot recommend this place enough!"

The cottage is charming without a single need overlooked. I noted the smallest of details, from the coatstand with canvas shoppers and an umbrella to throw rugs, a pour-over for my coffee, and sunscreen in the bathroom, which we forgot when we packed. Page went even further to personalize our experience with a kind note and a treat in the fridge. She invited me to use her outdoor grill and help myself to the herb patch growing right next to it. There was literally no stone overturned to make our experience memorable. We would gladly return!"

The location couldn't be better—it's within walking distance of everything New Bern has to offer. You can take a leisurely stroll through the historic downtown area, explore the quaint shops, or enjoy the many restaurants and cafes. Being able to walk to local attractions like Tryon Palace and Union Point Park is such a treat, making it easy to immerse yourself in the local culture and history without needing to drive anywhere.
The host is delightful, always ready to offer recommendations and make sure your stay is as enjoyable as possible. Whether you're visiting for a weekend getaway or a longer stay, you'll find this spot to be a relaxing and convenient base for all your New Bern adventures. Highly recommended!"

You walk down a small path to what seems like a fairytale cottage. The loft is just beautiful, and the bed and bedding are amazing. So comfortable, you just really don't want to get out of bed. The shower is small but mighty, and again, you just won't want to leave it.
The location could not be better. A short 3 block walk, and you are in the middle of a beautifully revitalized downtown. History, great restaurants, and shops to satisfy any shopper.
Thank you, Page, for sharing such a cozy and peaceful home away from home. We hope to come back for a revisit."

Such an adorable place and Page is a great hostess. We loved looking through her book collection and the kids were so excited to find games and coloring books. We enjoyed a drink on the patio before walking a few quick blocks downtown for dinner. Hope to be back for a weekend stay!

She even supplied us with some snacks, toiletries ( if needed), a list of local restaurants, sights to see and a sweet note with a side of local macaroons (so delicious). One of our favorite things about Page, as our host, was we were able to bring our sweet dog with us. We highly recommend this place. A hidden gem in downtown New Bern."

Small space comfortable for 1 or 2. climb to upper bed is steep, bed comfortable with its own river view . neighborhood walkable, as area lovely country and roads are quiet. Be aware many of the neighbors have loose dogs that treated me politely. The peaceful place with a grade A view of nature that I hoped for.

It's quite a thing ....to wake up and watch the sunrise on the river, it makes you want to lay in bed and relax and make a cup of coffee and sit on the dock at the same time. I could go on and on this place has a personality all its own, and New Bern is a charming place that seems frozen in time in the best ways imaginable.

It will take your breath away! Nothing beats waking up and having a cup of coffee on the dock and enjoying the views! Bruce was super accommodating. Before we booked we let him know we have a rescue dog, Bandit, who doesn’t handle new people or other animals well, to make sure that was okay. Bruce said it was not a problem and the whole time we were there he kept his sweet pup on the leash and let us know when they were going to be out and about to make sure not to upset Bandit. This was our first time traveling with our dogs, so with him going the extra mile for us kept my mind at ease. If you are traveling to New Bern, Bruce’s airbnb needs to be the place you stay!"

Despite Tropical Storm Ophelia literally raining down on us he made us feel safe and checked in on us even in advance of arrival. He truly went above and beyond to ensure our stay was great. He even had a bag of tea candles hanging on the front door knob when we arrived so we would have light if we experienced a power outage-which we thankfully did not. Can’t thank Bruce enough and we will definitely be back‼️ Storm or no storm….nothing can keep us from coming back to the River House 👍🏼

Bruce is a friendly, accommodating, responsive host who gave us privacy but was also happy to talk and give us helpful pointers about this or that. The cabin is thoughtfully decorated and worked well for our little family, two adults, our college daughter, and our two dogs. The futon was comfortable and the fold-out couch worked great for our daughter. Nice linens and touches throughout. I especially appreciated the vintage/outdoorsy vibe. You don't have to leave the cabin interior to feel a sense of being near the water, but the dock and canoe are even more immersive. I took a walk around the neighborhood loop road and enjoyed the wildlife and solitude-lots of birds, geese, deer. Great space and New Bern was a fun place to explore too."

Yoga and meditation on the dock , beautiful sunset , nice long walk along the country road , and even saw a deer swimming across the river. Next time I will
Kayak as I will definitely be back !!! I highly recommend relaxing and watching the river at River Watch ! Thank you , Bruce , for a wonderful get away at your lovely river cottage !!"

Bruce was extremely responsive and even went out of his way to stock the Airbnb with an iron and ironing board for myself and future guest use. I hope to be back and utilize his kayaks and water access in the future.

Stayed with a pet","We loved Bruce’s place on the river! The surroundings were so beautiful and peaceful. We really enjoyed bird watching while in the kayak. We saw osprey, geese, Turkey vultures, as well as an owl right on the property. We also came across several turtles crossing the road to the property, deer, and a black bear cub right in the neighborhood!
Bruce has done a great job with the place. It’s very updated and clean. The fun and cool details in and around the cabin were the best part. The big windows were amazing to look out over the river from any spot in the cabin. It’s quaint and comfortable. We were surprised by how restful the futon in the loft and the pull-out-couch were for sleeping.
Bruce was an excellent host and was easy and fun to talk to. He was accommodating and laidback. He also always has a dog treat in his pocket for the doggos. Our pup loved playing with his sweet dog, Finn, and the few neighborhood dogs that would find there way over.
We would stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","This is our favorite Air BNB ever! It was the perfect relaxation retreat for my son & I. Once we were there, we never wanted to leave. There was so much to do & the views were breathtaking! We watched magical sunsets & sunrises every day that we were there. Even in a passing storm, the place was heavenly. My son played guitar on the dock, we grilled & ate dinner by the water, we played late night darts, we painted & read books & wrote poetry & song lyrics. It was much needed restful tranquility. Bruce was the perfect host & was so helpful in getting my son set up with the kayak, which he loved in exploring all that the area has to offer! I appreciated him taking the time. He was so friendly & fun to chat with, along with his sweet rescue dog. We were impressed with the work he has done himself to create such a gorgeous retreat & could have talked for hours just about the unique VW Van that he is restoring! Such a fantastic work of art! So grateful for this getaway & hospitality!"

Check in was easy and the cabin was equipped with everything we needed for a weekend getaway. We will certainly be back in the warmer months to take advantage of the dock!

Bill communicated in timely fashion. Didn’t get to meet him, but maybe in the future! Thoroughly enjoyed our stay!!!!"

Stayed one night","I stayed at Bill's home for one night. The home is in a historic district in a wonderful neighborhood. There are sidewalks and a nearby River walk trail so it's very walkable and safe. You can easily walk to the Riverfront/ downtown area but if you drive, it's easy to find parking.
The house is beautiful. Bright, spotless and wonderfully decorated with a front porch swing to enjoy morning coffee. The upstairs room and bathroom were spacious, private and had everything I needed. The bed was very comfortable.
Although Bill wasn't there, he was extremely responsive, during my stay. He was welcoming, warm
and friendly and gave me some great insights about the area.
New Been itself is just lovely and I'm definitely planning a trip back. Without a doubt, I'd stay here again. Great home and great host!!!"

Like 4am and said come anytime!! Ended up not arriving til late. However, I had a late check out. So he was able to accommodate that and an extra night. Extremely kind host and checking up on ya to make sure you’re still alive lol. Beautiful place, bed and pillows were SO comfortable! And bedroom is big and spacey enough. There’s AC and able to adjust temp. And the location is PERFECT! Just make sure when you’re walking up/down the stairs to ALWAYS hold onto the railing. No matter how young and youthful you are. I took a hard fall but I’m to blame because I was TEXTING.. still hold on for dear life with those steps!!"

I was in town visiting New Bern for the Nicholas Sparks book signing and was in search for an affordable and convenient place to stay. I am so happy that I stumbled upon Bill and Liana's place. Not only was the location and price right, the room/home was very cozy, charming, clean, ...it had everything I needed! And I forgot my hair dryer, so it was a nice surprise to find one in the bathroom drawer LOL :) Bill was very good with communicating the arrival instructions and also made me feel welcomed. Thank you Bill and Liana for your hospitality! The town of New Bern was also very charming and the people were all friendly during my visit downtown. I highly recommend Cypress Hall and The Chelsea as restaurants to visit while you are in town."

Stayed a few nights","I would recommend Bill's place to absolutely anyone staying in New Bern. I was skeptical about sharing common spaces, but as soon as we walked through the door we felt right at home. Honestly, Bill's house is my dream home so maybe I'm biased when it comes to this one!
The inside is super stylist, modern, and updated. You have total privacy, but everyone in the neighborhood is so friendly you may just end up making new friends. We loved all of the little touches that went into creating the experience for guests. It's honestly just something you have to see to really understand - because the tiny details are everywhere!!
My favorite part was the kitchen. The coffee station is just so cute and thoughtful - Bill and his wife went out of their way to make this the perfect New Bern Air BNB."

High ceilings with some impressive overhead modern lighting fixtures in the splendid kitchen, great library seating area, cozy bedroom and deep bathtub,.. plus a greeting by the cats who seemed to have been queued to complete the postcard beauty of the cottage. And in the morning as we were leaving, the train lumbered by on the tracks that bisect the street (never saw or heard it until then),.. walking to the main street and back for our dinner accentuated the pleasantness of the entire stay. We felt our experience of the town was enhanced by staying at such a historic address rather than at a hotel. The rules were easy to follow. You will feel fortunate to be have been granted the experience,.."

Stayed one night","We had heard so much about the New Bern area that we wanted to check it out ourselves. We made this decision on the fly, as was our choice of Jessica’s place.
Very glad we chose to stay here.
The description was spot-on and the place was more spacious than we had anticipated.
The decor was well-chosen to align with the historical nature of the house, but modern and uplifting.
Most everything we wanted was within walking distance and this encouraged us to “get our steps in.” So much to explore.
We got to see a train go by & were surprised how quiet it was.
The house is private and comfortable.
Communication was great and check-in/out was easy.
Additional points for labeling the light switches :-)
The water was hot and pressure was great.
We did not need to do laundry, but yeah, they have that too.
With so many modern upgrades, you almost forget the house has a long cool history.
So yes, definitely recommend!"

Whether your walking barefoot on the original plank flooring, taking in the views of historic houses in the area or walking along the Cape Fear. This place is located to do something or nothing at all. Your minutes from shopping or a leisurely drive down the coast. Jessica has outfitted the cottage with assorted pamplets and flyers of local businesses and if its just a weekend getaway she has a variety of books to read. Except for clothes, food and personal items needed, Jessica has really put the work in to make this place feel homey. I will definitely be wanting to come back this Spring."

Stayed a few nights","Charming cottage stay in a quite location in New Bern for shorter stays.
Pros:
1. The cottage living room and kitchen area are bright and roomy
2. It was very clean and no smell of old wood furniture or boards even though the cottage is of heritage class
3. Easy to locate and it is within walking distance (under 10 mins) to New Bern downtown
4. Host is very responsive
Cons:
1. Size of the bathroom is a bit challenging for a comfortable use, not convenient for longer stays
2. Water drain speed in the shower tub was not quite right and needs to be rectified, the cleanliness of bathroom could be better overall
3. Was lacking equipment to iron clothes, this is a basic necessity if the place is more of a house setup offered to guests, it wasn't show stopper for us as we bought along our iron after enquiring with the host
Overall a charming place to stay with a unique cottage stay experience, minor challenges which can be overcome/rectified"

Stayed a few nights","A very beautiful, clean and comfortable place to stay in New Bern! My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights and would absolutely stay here again. Jessica was a great host! She was easy to contact with quick response time. The home had everything we needed. We were within walking distance of the lovely downtown area, the waterfront, and Tryon Palace. We very much enjoyed coffee and treats at Crema Brew, lunch/dessert at The Chelsea, and lunch on the waterfront at Persimmons."

Stayed one night","My wife and I stayed here for one night and fell in love with this little cottage. We were celebrating our 5th wedding anniversary and wanted to explore a historic town we’ve never been before so we choose New Bern and had a great time! Jessica’s cottage was perfect all the way around. Parking and check in were easy. We were greeted by one of the cats as we were hoping for:) Location is perfect for exploring downtown New Bern by foot. We always felt safe and enjoyed our evening and morning walks down by the river and around the neighborhoods checking out the beautiful historic homes. We even saw the train come down the middle of the street which was neat! The cottage was very clean, comfortable and plenty spacious for my wife and I. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back."

She mentioned to us that she was around if we needed her and although we didn’t, we felt comfortable to if we needed to. The cottage is more than we expected! It felt warm and inviting and the decor and furniture complimented the beautiful town. The cottage was SO clean. Jessica provided us with everything we needed during our stay and left us wanting for nothing! Everything down to the soft towels, and cozy throw blankets were perfect. My bestfriend and I couldn’t have picked a better place to spend our weekend away!"

The cottage is conveniently located right beside downtown so everything is easily accessible and near all of the best restaurants. The cottage and the owners are a true gem of New Bern and if you are a seasoned/new visitor this is the place to stay to get a true feel of what makes the town so special . Would love to stay again and will be my first choice going forward.

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I traveled to New Bern for our 1 year wedding anniversary/babymoon. We were looking for a quiet town with lots of good food and history and thought this would be the perfect place. We were absolutely correct. We loved our time in the town and especially loved our time at Jessica's cottage. It is in the perfect location and we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go (even at 8 months pregnant). The place was super clean and exactly what we expected. While it is located right next to the families main residence, you still feel like you are in your own little world and there is a great sense of privacy. Check in and out were easy and Jessica was very helpful with suggestions for restaurants/things to do. I was sad to leave and wish we could have extended our stay. We sure hope to make it back to New Bern in the future and when we do, we wouldn't want to stay anywhere else!"
