Stayed a few nights","We had an amazing stay! I don't think I've ever been greeted as warmly or as generosly. The house was far more luxurious than I had expected, and every detail was more than thought through: piles of fluffy towels, lots of thoughtful snacks, super comfy beds, top-of-the-line cookware (no worn-out teflon pans here!). We felt that every effort had been made to ensure that we had a lovely stay. The house itself is much bigger and more sylish than comes through in the photos - the bedrooms and bathrooms in particular were totally luxurious. We were even invited to pick from the veg garden! And outside, the menagerie of sweet animals brought us smiles and delight, while the trails (that can be accessed right from the house) were perfect for a long ramble, and are inviting enough for even beginner hikers. A truly deightful experience!"

Stayed a few nights","Have you ever dreamed about having a sleep over at a petting zoo? But with really comfy beds and a great shower? Well, now you can! When you travel, do you think you should learn something? Go to a museum or read a book at the beach? At The Den, you can enroll in Animal Husbandry 101! The Den was an amazingly unique blend of total comfort in a cozy space and full on working farm. This was a totally unique and special experience I can’t wait to have again. As far as cleanliness, attention to detail, comfort and coziness The Den checked every box. The gorgeous natural landscape and cuddly animals made for a special experience to connect to nature in the most meaningful of ways. The weekend felt like a totally unique experience, and the hosts clearly put forth a great deal of effort to make sure your experience is exceptional. The Den truly feels like a rare opportunity and gift to humanity just waiting to be discovered."

Stayed with kids","This was our third stay at the property and for good reason: It’s amazing! Chris and Jarvis are incredibly thoughtful hosts, and the space is comfortable and well appointed - they really have thought of everything. The grounds of the home are beautiful and peaceful and you cannot beat walking directly onto miles and miles of trails. If you do want to leave the property, they’re also just a quick drive to several fun activities, restaurants, breweries, etc.
If you’re looking for a comfortable and enjoyable place to stay with fantastic hospitality in beautiful surrounds- look no further."

Stayed with kids","We had such an amazing stay. Jarvis and Chris were so kind. They met us when we arrived and showed us all around and told us all about their animals and the area. We loved spending time watching the animals, especially during feeding time and it was so nice to be able to go out on trails right from the property. The home itself was super clean and comfortable with everything you would need. They even supplied snacks, fresh bread, pastries and eggs from the chickens. We had such a wonderful and memorable stay."

Stayed with kids","This space is magical. Part of me wants to keep it as my little secret to enchantment but that wouldn't be fair. We chose this place to have an experience unlike your traditional airbnb and it totally surpassed all of the expectations. Tucked away into the trees is this remarkable homestead you get to be with the llamas, horses, and many other furry animals. Jarvis greeted us and showed us around that allowed us to get settled and enjoy ALL there's to offer. My husband was hesitant on using the amenities (pool & outdoor space) but they were so inviting and created enough privacy that we never felt weird about it, so don’t let that talk you out of booking this!! Our toddler (almost2) had an amazing time as well. As city folk, it was awesome to teach our son all about animals & nature by being in it. By the time we left, he was so confident with the animals & surroundings.
PRO TIP: bring clothes/shoes that you can handle getting dirty, you don’t want that to hold you back."

What to expect outdoors: an eclectic collection of yard ornaments, a congenial and beautifully cared for group of animal kin, easily accessible hiking trails, and the natural beauty of a forested ridge. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay."

The unit itself is so very comfortable and well appointed. There is so much to do just on the property - lounging by the pool, exploring the expansive trail network just off the property and visiting with the animals on the farm, but it’s also just a short drive from many fun attractions, breweries, etc. Our daughter just loved petting the alpacas and goats! I highly recommend anyone stay at The Den—you’ll have an amazing time!"

Their place is well thought-out and well-stocked, and the living area was perfect for hanging out, cooking, and playing games. You could spend hours looking around at all the details around the house and in the yard. They provide everything you could possibly need. Jarvis and Chris are exceptionally welcoming, and we loved hearing their stories and meeting their animals. I also appreciated that the property connected to the Nordic hiking trails, and this is an ideal place to stay for the Ice Age Trail and Kettle Moraine trail races. We all plan to be back to visit again."

Stayed with kids","Spring weekend at the farm! We brought our two kids (almost 3 and 9 months) to this magical place for a weekend away. While it rained almost our entire stay, we put on our rain gear and enjoyed the animals and beautiful property. Chickens, goats, alpacas and more. Emma loved chasing after the ducks, the swing set overlooking the farm, and petting Sophie the goat. Inside, we enjoyed the many games available and cooked up the fresh eggs provided by our hosts. Right on the Nordic trail system, there are a lot of hills…so definitely a lot of hand holding for small kids…but gorgeous scenery overlooking the forest. Super comfy beds and soft linens. Felt like a big hotel suite! Popped up our pack and play with plenty of room. Can’t wait to return! Highly recommend!"

They were gracious and knowledgeable hosts that ensured that we had everything we needed for a wonderful stay and great conversation :). If you’re on the fence, this is the sign to get off the fence and meet the alpacas!"

Stayed a few nights","Possibly the best Air BnB I have ever stayed in! My girlfriend and I went to stay in the Nordic Den for our anniversary weekend and we couldn't have chosen a better place. Jarvis' farm is tucked into the Kettle Morraine Forest and has private access to the ski and hiking trails. The farm is magical and full of adorable animals including alpacas, miniature horses, ducks, guinea fowl and goats. The goats and alpacas are super friendly and we had a blast playing with and petting them. The house is extremely well stocked, cozy and comfortable. The king size bed was amazing! We enjoyed bird watching from the front sliding doors. Jarvis goes above and beyond as a host. There was beer and wine in the fridge, coffee and tea and fresh eggs and bacon from the farm. Jarvis even got us a ""happy anniversary"" cake. We forgot cinnamon for our breakfast one morning so we texted Jarvis to see if he had some and he was down in seconds with bottle of cinnamon for us. I truly can't say enough wonderful things about Jarvis and his farm. I'll definitely be back!!!"

The energy around the farm and animals is also a wonderful addition. We saw and visited the animals several times - and had to stop by to say good bye to the Alpacas (Jeremiah and Victoria in particular) before we left. Thank you!

They have a big truck and mentioned if we got stuck in the snow or stranded, to just give them a call and they'll be there. The animals and ambiance of the place is unmatched, and the host's friendliness was wonderful. Close to Alpine for snowboarding, as well as wonderful restaurants nearby and in downtown Whitewater. Definitely coming back :) !!! Animals walking around was so cool!!"

Our daughter loved the exposure to all the animals. She has already asked to go back. The Airbnb was everything we were hoping for. Chris and Jarvis were so incredibly kind and thoughtful! They went above and beyond as hosts. Words can’t express how grateful we are to Chris and Jarvis for this experience. We are definitely planning a trip back to experience another season at the Den.

Stayed with kids","Our stay was fantastic! This was our first stay but it certainly won't be the last. If you're looking for a great place to stay with generous hosts in a beautiful outdoors-oriented location, look no further: just stay here. The details:
The House: Outside of being modern and incredibly well decorated, it is also VERY comfortable, more in line with a luxury hotel than an AirBnB. The beds were very comfortable, the linens were soft and they have really thought of everything to make you feel at home, from towels just for your makeup to robes to relax in, a well-appointed kitchen with anything you could ever need and a couch you can just sink into. They also have an excellent gym that is much more well-appointed than the photos show: in addition to cardio they also have a TRX, full weight rack and barbells, resistance bands (both circle and w/ handles), rollers and more. Once you're done with the workout, the shower gets excellent water pressure too. Much appreciated after the hikes!
The Property: Gorgeous! The property is very close to a great trail system for hiking, running or xc skiing in winter...it's exactly a 4 minute walk along the property line to the trail. The animals on the property are what make this place so fun though! Chris/Jarvis' fur family is so sweet and I have a feeling our two-year-old will be talking about Jeremiah the Alpaca, the chickens and the baby goats for a long long time.
The hosts: Warm, generous, kind and knowledgeable, Chris and Jarvis will go out of their way to make you feel at home. They go above and beyond from the sweet welcome kits, to giving us a tour upon arrival and providing us with delicious fresh eggs for our mornings. Their recommendations for activities, restaurants and other local landmarks were fantastic. They were both very intentional about interacting with our two-year-old daughter and helping her get to know the animals, which was incredibly sweet.
We had a fantastic time - thank you for everything Chris and Jarvis!"

Stayed with kids","Wow! Where do I even start? This was more than an Airbnb - it was a fun, engaging, memorable, and beautiful experience hosted by two very kind, flexible, and generous people. This is a great place for a family (or friend) getaway, especially with little ones who love animals! (Bonus - the softest, fluffiest, cleanest carpet in the house for babies to crawl/roll around/pull to stand on!) We spent a lot of time with the friendly alpacas and funny goats, explored the wildlife and went on a hike, swam in the pool, ate fresh eggs from the chickens, slept so well in the comfiest king bed with an assortment of pillows to choose from, and got tasty local take-out based on Jarvis’s excellent recommendation. This incredible property and its gracious hosts allowed for us to stay on the property and be plenty entertained. Jarvis and Chris - thank you for your hospitality! We would love to come back to see you guys, and our alpaca friends Gilbert and Jeremiah! (My 2yo daughter still talks about them!)"

Stayed a few nights","My 12-year-old daughter and I went for a weekend getaway in June after reading all of the positive reviews. I have to say I agree with a previous reviewer who said “stop reading the reviews and just book it!” From the hosts’ hospitality, easy check-in, to the many amenities, the immaculately maintained rental unit, and most uniquely the absolutely stunning grounds, gardens and animals – it’s hard to find a single complaint. We especially enjoyed the easy access to the Nordic trail in Kettle Moraine. It was an easy, relaxing 2-hour drive from the western Chicago suburbs. We were so glad we opted for this easy rejuvenating visit instead of the hassle of flying somewhere."

Stayed with kids","We’ve stayed at a lot of Airbnb’s and this is one of our favorites. We live an hour away, and wanted to take a long weekend to have some fun. On the recommendation of a friend, we chose this Airbnb. And we’re so glad we did! Jarvis and Chris wonderful hosts and experiencing their animals up close was incredible. Our sons, wages 13 and 10 will be talking about this for years! We got to play with their goats, walk with their alpacas, gather fresh eggs from their chickens, watch their morning and night feedings, and learn all about their animals. It was fascinating to learn, even for us adults. Many farmettes will not allow you inside the pens of the animals. Jarvis and Chris taught us how to enter the pens and experience their animals up close. It’s evident they care deeply for their animals. The living quarters is newly renovated, very clean, spacious, and our hosts were always available to help us in any way. All details were well thought out. Kettle Moraine Hiking trails are connected to their property and that was an added bonus. We will be back!"

As parents we were amazed at the accommodations, fascinated by the animals, and impressed with the over-the-top effort by the hosts. We cross country skied during the day and were able to get some exercise in the included workout room. We were looking for a weekend away from home in a location we knew very little about and ended up so happy with the experience that we are already planning to return. I would recommend this for anyone with or without children for any amount of time. A true gem."

Stayed a few nights","What a hidden gem situated so close to Chicago, Madison, Milwaukee! It was only 1.5 hours from our home in the Chicago suburbs. We spent a relaxing weekend in The Den at Nordic Ridge, and we can't wait to go back and bring our kids. The hosts generously left gifts of bacon, bread, wine, beer, and pop...along with a delicious sweet treat. They were responsive but also very respectful of our time and space. The space is furnished with eclectic and beautiful taste. The beds and linens and soaps are top quality. The outside space is well furnished with a beautiful view of the pond. All this would have made for a great stay, but it's the animals that really make this spot something above and beyond special. We loved nuzzling the alpacas, scratching the goats, and learning the stories about the other animals that live on the property. The private access directly to the Kettle Moraine trails is an added bonus. The price is a steal for the incredible experience you will have when you stay. This is definitely one of those spots that stick with you and makes you want to return again and again!"

Jarvis and Chris stocked the place with bacon, eggs right from their chickens, beer, wine, locally made apple pie and bread, water. The place had everything you could expect and more. The premises are so nice, you are in the woods but on an animal far. There is a view through the trees of a pond as well. The grounds have gardens with squash that are there and available to you. There is a grill and a deck that is right by a pool. It is so peaceful there besides the animal noises. It was so fun to be able to visit the animals. We enjoyed it so much and will definitely be back!"

Stayed a few nights","What a wonderful property! Just what we needed! Even during a pandemic, we just had to celebrate our son's graduation, and this Airbnb fit the bill! The rooms were lovely and decorated with real class, the flower gardens were beautiful, and the setting out in the Wisconsin woods was peaceful and calming. They thought of everything, too. Many, many nice amenities -- snacks, fresh eggs, bacon, water, sunblock, even binoculars! We loved visiting with the animals on their farm -- the goats, chickens, alpacas, mini-horses, geese, etc, as well as their two dogs! The hosts were very accommodating, and always got back to our texts quickly. The only (minor) issue was that it was chilly in our rooms, but they had lots of blankets and even a couple space heaters to warm things up. All in all, this was the BEST Airbnb we've ever stayed at!"

The accommodations are immaculate, spacious & filled with such interesting little decorations. Every tip for things to do & places to eat were spot on. Waking up in the morning and enjoying fresh eggs, choosing delicious selections from the garden, and visiting with the animals was a perfect start to each day."

Stayed with kids","My family’s first Airbnb experience and wow! We needed to get out of the city and into the woods and found this great gem! I was confident when booking and Jarvis was quick to respond and I knew we’d be setup for a great weekend.
Upon arrival we were graciously greeted and realized this property already exceeded our high expectations. A list of all the positives:
Immaculately clean accommodations and perfectly and thoughtfully appointed.
Fresh eggs, like still warm!
Kids got to feed the goats, alpacas, ducks and chickens.
100 steps to hiking trails.
Great biking all around.
Jarvis recommended good restaurants, grocery store, etc.
Birdwatching, rainbows, friendly dogs, fire pit, idyllic setting in nature and lovely outdoor deck. You really can’t ask for anything else."

Stayed with kids","Jarvis was a wonderful host and the place was amazing! Our family greatly enjoyed a winter vacation in the immaculately clean and well furnished first floor. The space had everything we needed and had really neat antiques. Jarvis and Chris did most of the work of renovation themselves. Ask, you will hear stories behind everything! The location is perfect. We love this area of Wisconsin, and the property has access to the Nordic trails area of Kettle Moraine State Forest. Since you enter at the back, it's less crowded then coming in via the parking lot. There are many neat restaurants in nearby towns, and Jarvis was happy to share his favorites. Finally, the kids very much enjoyed the alpacas and other farm animals. We had a great stay, and look forward to returning."

Stayed a few nights","Jarvis & Chris provided over-the-top hospitality from the baked goods and farm-fresh eggs to the entire home they opened up for us to stay in. This place is stunning and exceeded all of our expectations. One walk around the grounds and we had all wished we added an extra day to the trip.
The house was spotless and filled with many little things to make our stay comfortable. We enjoyed most sitting on the porches/patio enjoying the eclectic touches they've put into their home.
All the basic necessities were well provided and they were quick to help us out when borrowing a small kitchen appliance.
Communication with both Jarvis and Chris was effortless and timely. This made the trip smooth for our group as we traveled in from Minnesota. They know the area well and provided great tips in the small nearby communities.
Parking is adequate and although we didn't travel in two vehicles they were quick to accommodate us if we had.
We really enjoyed this place because of how amazing the space was, but we really enjoyed interacting with Jarvis and Chris. They were thoughtful of our space and shared a glass of bourbon as the firefly's lit up their back yard.
Great people, lots of laughs together and fantastic hosts!"

We were greeted with hot, freshly baked banana nut scones and a refrigerator full of beverages and delicious breakfast provisions of farm fresh eggs and local bacon. The space was spacious and stylish with a mix of antiques and comfortable furnishings. The fresh flowers and handmade candles were a thoughtful touch. We loved sipping coffee overlooking the woods, hiking trails right off the property and wandering around visiting the farm animals. It was a great proximity to the concert venue we were going to and we’ve already rebooked a return trip in the fall! Perfect for four people and Jarvis and Chris were the most friendly and accommodating hosts we’ve had. Our group agreed we’d give them ten stars if it was an option!"

Stayed over a week","This is a historic old home with great vibes that has been lovingly preserved and appointed with everything you need to have an amazing getaway.
I had the exceptional experience of staying here for 3 months while helping my adult son who lives nearby. On the way to Wisconsin, I broke my foot which made my stay much more of an unexpected adventure. Amanda is an attentive and caring host and did everything to make sure I had what I needed. She is a wealth of local information from farmer’s markets to amazing nearby hiking spots and great thrift/antique shops. She was very accommodating to my peculiar situation by bringing up my mail, offering to help with shopping, and even brought goodies from their splendid garden.
Amanda cares deeply about making sure your visit at her home is a success. You will be staying in the charming attic apartment of their family home so if you are looking to party, keep looking. But if you are searching for a peaceful and beautiful retreat with tree top views that is close to some great restaurants, town walks, ice cream, tons of outdoor recreation and fun day trips, this is the place.
I arrived as a stranger and left as a friend and hope to return again sometime soon."

It’s an easy walk to the hospital, to the grocery store, to Walgreens, and more, so the location couldn’t be beat. The space itself is fantastic. Decorated wonderfully, has all the features, and just a joy to be in. Amanda couldn’t be a more perfect host. She was easy to reach, very communicative, unbelievably friendly, and extremely accommodating to our needs. She welcomed us bringing a newborn into the space, and she even provided us with a bassinet, Mamaroo, swaddle blankets, burp cloths, and more. Laundry was available in the basement whenever we needed it. This was just a dream come true, and we have no idea how we could have made things work any other way. I recommend this 110%, and we’ll definitely be staying here again whenever we’re in town to visit."

Stayed a few nights","The space is so cozy and the decor is gorgeous. The bedroom is separate from the living room so that was really nice to have such a relaxing separate nook for better rest if another person wanted to stay up. The apartment has everything a couple or individual would need: bathroom, dining space, living room, full kitchen, and private bedroom so that you don't feel it's so small but yet not so big for a small party. The kitchen is fairly well stocked. It maybe could use a few more knives, like steak knives, and lids for the pans but you can do quite a bit in that kitchen set up. We liked how the space was equipped to empower us to be independent and have what we needed. We also liked we could come and go as we pleased, and had plenty of privacy from the owners unlike renting an inhome room. The owners are very nice when we did run into them we chatted for a bit. It's a great setup and wish we would have extended our stay!"

I was in love this entire place, every little detail added to the aesthetic and really made you feel like you were at home! Amanda was so accommodating and quickly responded to every message I sent. The temperature was well below 0 degrees outside and she provided a space heater and made sure the place was nice and warm by the time we arrived. We stayed cozy the whole time we were there, with plenty of blankets on the bed as well. There was nice coffee provided and we had everything we needed to cook breakfast in the mornings. I can't say much about the town as we drove out to Lapham Peak for cross country skiing and did not explore Fort Atkinson but it appeared to be in a great location near the town. I am looking forward to returning in warmer weather and enjoying the location more. But it is a quick drive (20-30 min) to tons of trail heads in Kettle Moraine and plenty of beautiful spots to explore. We are already planning our next visit!"

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I had planned on a nice tropical vacation for our 10 year anniversary, but because of COVID we had to postpone and make different plans. We decided on Ft Atkinson because it was close to Madison, close to the water, and we found this super cozy apt. Immediately upon requesting a reservation, Amanda was on it and made us feel welcome. She gave us great recommendations on local breweries, kayaking areas, and nearby shopping areas. We met them the first day we were there and they were the most cordial, accommodating people. Anything we needed, they were on it.
The apt itself was exactly what we were looking for. Third floor of a monster house with private entrance, cozy living space and dining area with full kitchen. They chose great decor and the space had a super cozy feel.
I would not be surprised if we were back there again next year. Strongly recommend this place if you want to explore the Ft Atkinson/Cambridge area."

Stayed a few nights","Just wow! Stay here! Or don't so it's available next time I want to stay. ;) This place is truly a gem. It's so cozy and stylish. Very thoughtful decorations. Not that it's a bad thing, but many Airbnb's I've stayed in seem like the furniture, dishes, etc are afterthoughts or ""our old things"" but Amanda has curated an incredible little apartment...from the big TV to the vintage wall art to the Boho dishes. There are so many little surprises that just absolutely delighted me!
Other pluses: comfy bed, lots of closet space, plenty of kitchen fridge/counter space, and TV with fire stick.
To top it all off, we had an issue with our booking and Airbnb was glitching, but Amanda was able to spend time on the phone with customer service and get it figured out for us. Above and beyond!"

Not sure how that would work if the temperature was extremely cold outside. Also we couldn’t get anything to work on theTV other than pay channels.

Having a full kitchen was very nice, so I could whip up a quick breakfast before going to work. This is an old and interesting house in the Craftsman style I think, but it has all the modern amenities you expect, and was not cold or drafty (I was there in mid-December).
The family is very nice and respond to messages very quickly. They even recommended me to a good tire shop in the town when my car picked up a nail at the jobsite.
The description mentions a dog on the property, but I only saw it once, and never heard it. I didn’t see a single dog hair anywhere, so I doubt that even anyone with allergies would have a problem."

The location is great as many restaurants, a grocery store, Walgreens, and several parks are within a short walk. Amanda was always timely with communication and made sure everything was going well. She also tipped me off to events that were happening during my stay. I would not hesitate to stay here again."

I can't say enough positive things about the property and host. My friends and I will be back again very soon!

There are even trails through the woods on the 18 acre property. My husband, two kids and I hiked around them and saw an adorable red fox. It stopped on the trail ahead of us and stared at us for a second before it ran away. ❤️ we brought games to play, art supplies, etc. and they had a dvd player for movies.

It is an older cabin, so there’s some sound bleed from creaky floors and whatnot, but we found that just added to the charm. Definitely keeping it on my list for another visit one day!"

Stayed with kids","This was one of my favorite Airbnbs so far (and I have stayed in tons over the years!). It was so beautiful and the perfect mixture of elegance, hipster vibes, home comforts, family-friendly, and mid-century modern to top it all off! I stayed there with my husband and our two children (6 and 11), we listened to vinyl, read books, roasted s'mores and relaxed every evening in the incredible hot tub! There were plenty of towels, even shampoo/conditioner/body wash was provided! The bed sheets were insanely soft and cozy and the entire house was designed for relaxation and rest. We cooked a few meals and they had all the utensils and supplies you need (herbs etc). the hosts (Robert and Brenna) were proactive, responsive and super easy to communicate with. I would go back in a heartbeat! Our favorite things were the hot tub, the design/decor of the house and the epic shower just off the master bedroom! Don't waste another second, book this place immediately!"

Group trip","The stay was great! We stayed for a college spring break trip and we had a wonderful peaceful time. Upon arrival, we had an easy check-in and the home was very clean. We were surprised that the kitchen had extra food and spice options. We assumed maybe other guests had left them, but all the items were clean and fresh so we did use the extra items for cooking. Our whole party had a comfy place to sleep and the home was well-stocked with towels, linens, and paper goods. We used the hot tube each night we stayed and loved it. We did try to use the smart tv but couldn't manage to connect it, but we explored the ready stock of DVDs to watch movies and we definitely enjoyed the Polk sound bar. Overall, wonderful stay and would highly recommend it!"

We spent so much time in the soothing hot tub under the stars. We had so much fun cooking all of our meals in the spacious kitchen. We kept the fireplace crackling all weekend. Played so many board games while listening to records. We brought our antenna from home & were able to pick up the local channels to watch the nfl championship football games. Spending so much quality time was so meaningful to us!! We would definitely love to stay here again someday!

I enjoyed having morning coffee sitting on the deck watching the groups of chipmunks and squirrels that live in the the woods. In the evening and night, the woods are lit up by fireflies! The accomodations were thoughtful and well designed. Beds were supportive foam and very comfortable bedding. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook our meals. We enjoyed connecting as a family for meals and games in the evening. We watched a couple DVD movies on the large TV in the living room area as well. The cabin is in a great location, 10 minutes to Whitewater, where we did some initial grocery shopping, and we drove the 20 minute trip to Janesville a couple times. Overall a very lovely and peaceful experience here."

Superb interior building design, comfy beds, a well stocked kitchen, family entertainment activities provided, and an outdoor hot tub and firepit... a great place to relax! We were blessed to see some wildlife, including baby bluejays and their parents who'd come to feed on the berry trees, monarch and other butterflies, chipmunks, squirrels, and even a large doe that came out near the house at one point. Somehow the stars seemed brighter and more numerous, as well. So enjoyable! Our only regret is that we couldn't stay longer."

The absence of wi-fi was a blessing, a welcome break from the outside world - particularly when a few family members came for a meal. We enjoyed conversation and laughter without distractions, shot some retro photos and enjoyed a meal together in the well-designed kitchen. There is room to spread out, laze, view nature from indoors or meander on the land. We all look forward to returning."

The house is easy to find, and once we were there we found it was well equipped with towels, comfortable (firm) memory foam mattresses, an easy to use top-quality bluetooth sound bar, coffee, tea, kitchen utensils and appliances, and barware. If we didn't go skiing, we would have been completely comfortable not leaving the house all weekend. The hot tub is clean and large, and the fire pit is not far away with cozy adirondak chairs. We will likely be staying here again, and definitely looking forward to it!"

Stayed with kids","We booked this Airbnb for a weekend getaway, and it did not disappoint! I am a sucker for beautiful homes and well designed spaces, and this home felt absolutely magical to exist in for a few days. The structure itself is unique. I mean, how many times have you been in a Sandcrawler-mid-century-bunker-lodge-house? It truly was as cool as the photos look. Lots of natural sunlight, plenty of space to spread out and relax, and the perfect combo of vintage aesthetic and modern amenities. It was 5ºF with windchill and the hot tub was perfectly heated. The lack of Wifi wasn't a problem for us, we got really good cell service if we needed to access the internet via our phones. We had a good time doing a thrift circuit between Whitewater, Fort Atkinson, and Janesville. In a year where we aren't doing much travel far from home (de-ja-vu), this was exactly what we needed to fulfill that travel itch and feel special for a weekend."

Our stay was at the beginning of October 2021 and the leaves were just starting to change and watching them fall from the 2 story windows in the living area was amazing. We were totally impressed with the spa shower. What a great relaxing time after hiking at Parfrey's Glen and Devil's Lake (about 1 hour 20 minutes away and worth the trip). The mattress in the main bedroom was very comfortable. This is definitely the place to unwind and disconnect from the busy world. The historic downtown area of Whitewater is only 10 minutes away and has some great shops and restaurants to explore. Taco Fresco has great fresh food! We are definitely planning a return trip!

The house was so clean! We loved cooking in the kitchen, walking the trails, and having evening campfires followed by time in the jacuzzi under the stars. We had planned to just stay on the main floor in the fantastic master suite, but found the upstairs bedroom on the opposite side to be the quietest for a good night’s sleep (some low mechanical noise from a pump that seems to be constantly running). There are numerous cozy spots to curl up with a book, watch wildlife through the windows or from out on the deck, and perfect tables for games or a puzzle. We would love to stay here again!"

In case folks are wondering, inside the house verizon had 1 bar with steady lte internet. Outside my at&t also had reception enough to stream music. Would definitelu go back in the future."

Although there was no internet connection, there was some 5G and LTE coverage every now and then. The whole house was clean, comfortable, and made a very enjoyable experience within itself."

Stayed with kids","Some places just speak to your soul. Nestled in a dense cropping of woods on nearly 19 acres of rolling Southern Wisconsin farmland, this gem of a property was everything we hoped for and way more. My wife and I LOVE mid-century modern homes. When we saw this 1968 gem available to rent, we were thrilled. From the onset, the communication from Rob and Brenna was exceptional, prompt, accommodating, and professional.
When we rolled up the long drive through the forest and arrived, we found this swanky domicile to be immaculately clean. It gleamed and smelled fresh—props to the cleaning crew.
The layout of the house is open with lots of glass and windows and striking fieldstone fireplaces. The rooms have a wonderful flow to them and the house feels remarkably spacious as a result. One thing we really loved about it were all the details. Rob and team have appointed the home with so many quality and thoughtful details: phenomenal barware (including a most apropos martini shaker), brand new cookware, and everything a family or small group needs to cook, entertain and have fun. I was thrilled to find a vinyl player with a mixture of period-perfect music, including a Stan Getz Bossa nova classic that we kept on regular rotation. We were intrigued by framed architectural renderings and documents from the home dating back to the 1960s. Details abound in this fantastic home.
We played board games with our three kids, read books, and slept in total comfort on the superb memory foam mattresses. The nights were dark and wonderfully still. We built a fire out in the yard by the woods, lounged in the hot tub, and after showered in a tastefully opulent four-head shower. Throughout, we disconnected from the great wide world. This was the getaway we didn’t even know we needed until we locked the house up, loaded in our car and drove away and my wife said it:
“That house spoke to us.”"

Small warning for y’all, if you drive a lowered, or low clearance vehicle, you will scrape on the driveway. No noticeable damage to my car thankfully but I’d either park on the street or take an aggressive angle getting uphill.

The private bathroom next to the bedroom was a plus. The space was a large, comfortable room with wifi connection. Janie was very friendly and helpful. The location was excellent for my purpose (very close to UWW). Janie was accommodating with a late check-in. Outstanding service, and I highly recommend."

Our sleeping arrangements were private and quiet, and we got an excellent nights sleep.
In the morning, we enjoyed complimentary breakfast treats and delicious coffee on their spacious patio, which is surrounded by birds and flowers. Very peaceful and inviting. Janie and Doug are as friendly and hospitable as they come. They really make you feel welcome. They are light-hearted and lots of fun to talk to. We look forward to staying there again."

One of the days we were there was rainy, and there was still plenty of space in the house for everyone to hang out together and still have space (especially for separate nap times).

The birdsong just hits you in the face when you get there--and every time you walk outside or open a window. It's fantastic!
We walked the bike trail, since we don't mountain bike, as well as road walking. Yea, we got a little lost and ended up walking at least double what we intended. I contacted Julie for help and they did offer to come give us a ride, but we had figured it out. :)
Very clean and the bed on the main floor was quite comfortable--even for me who has an autoimmune arthritis disease and fibromyalgia--so that's saying something!
Looking forward to staying here again in a couple weeks for a longer stay"

The host was super responsive and thought of all the little things from doggy poop pages and a special poop deposit bin, there were spices available to cook and a full bag of coffee for the Keurig. I can’t say enough about the peace and quiet out here and the hiking trail out back was lovely (albeit challenging) . Sad to leave"

Stayed a few nights","Wow! This place is one the air bnbs I've ever stayed at. The yard was amazing. firepit, enormous deck, back gate leading to a hiking trail, and even FRISBEE GOLF! the inside.... amazing! indoor fireplace ws perfect, TV was massive and couch with a giant beanbag on the side was extra comfy. the semi enclosed porch was perfect for enjoying the weather in moderation , and the kitchen was spacious with a great island capable of hosting a big cooking session, or a great hangout. they even have a classic video game arcade machine! solid amenities, leaving nothing lacking. rooms were comfy and spacious. really the only downside was the lack of a 2nd bathroom, which is just stretching for any negative. It was fine for our group 4 guys, but would possibly be a stress for more people and or couples. you really can't beat the amenities and value though. seriously this place is amazing and we hope to make it a regular outing destination."

There’s a pocket of evergreens Roy planted just behind the cabin by the campfire, that was my favorite place to spend time. The cabin itself has a wonderful design, a lot squeezed into its tiny footprint. The wood stove is cute and very functional!
No running water, so Roy has to deliver drinking and washing water. That was a little inconvenient, but no big deal.
Overall we loved our stay!"

Stayed one night","Roy is a respectable, generous, and responsive host. I was allowed an earlier check-in time, and he stopped by to help me start a fire, show me how to work the generator, supply me with some water, and introduce different aspects of the cabin. I enjoyed a little conversation with Roy, learning more about the land, though he kept it brief (likely considerately to grant me the privacy I had come out for). It was just the cabin, location, and experience I was looking for in a personal retreat for reflection and prayer: having noise privacy, serene, simple. Later, I learned something about fireplaces at the expense of a lot of Roy's complementary (no doubt hand-chopped from his own trees) firewood: 1) you can let the fire die down for a while and still retain plenty of heat in the cabin, and 2) you don't need to fear the fire going out and having to restart it because even if it dies down to embers, a new log thrown into the fireplace will still catch fire from the heat. I hope to return!"

Stayed one night","Roy’s Cabin was a treat of natural beauty. A wonderful, offline escape into a forest that he himself replanted many years ago. The cabin was cozy, warm, and well-built. Comfortable chairs, bed, and even an awesome loft that would work very well for families! It is truly a rustic experience, with any electricity coming from a generator, and heat from the wood stove. Water had to be brought in. This may seem like a con to some, but was fantastic for us. It meant a time to connect deeply. Roy himself is very kind, and helped us feel right at home, even though he had just lost his precious dog a few days before our stay… The one thing we didn’t get to do was explore much of the trails. But we did find the pond. One of my favorite stays so far 🌲"

Stayed a few nights","My daughter and I stayed at Roy’s cabin for our annual “camping”, and are thrilled with our find! Such a nice, week-appointed cabin, in a peaceful beautiful setting.
A great host, Roy literally thought of everything to make this a very comforting stay, while still being in nature, feeling like you are in the deep woods. He was very supportive providing lots of extras like ice, well water, warm water to wash with, and always there to help when needed. A quick tutorial on working the generator and starting a nice fire in the wood stove and we were good to go!
What’s also great about this location is that while being in a beautiful, quiet, remote setting, surrounded by nature, you are still a short drive from Whitewater with lots of shops and restaurants to choose from. A nice discovery was the Whitewater Fitness and Aquatic Center, where an $8 day pass gets you access to the gym, pool and a nice hot shower!
All in all, our best “camping” trip ever. We most definitely want to return!"

Stayed a few nights","Where to start! We went to Roy and Bea's beautiful cabin after our wedding. It was a beautiful, serene, and peaceful much needed get away! The cabin is exactly as described in pictures and descriptions- quiet, surrounded by nature, clean, and homey. We cannot begin to describe our time there. As avid out-in-the-middle-of-nowhere campers, this was our first ""glamping"" experience and boy, what a treat! Greeting Roy and Bea at the entrance was so lovely. They were so quick to make us feel at home. The property is gorgeous- with plenty of trails to explore, a pond with kayaks (some of us (my new husband) took an accidental swim), a clean and perfectly placed fire pit- we were astounded! We played cards inside by the lantern light, read our books on the porch in the rain, and climbed upstairs like we were in a treehouse. If you are reading this and considering other options-think again. This place is where you want to go. Thank you Roy for such a magnificent stay, we will be back again!"

What sets this Airbnb apart is Roy's unmatched warmth and hospitality. He made sure all our needs were met, from local dining tips to suggesting meteor gazing by the pond.

What a treat to be nestled in a Christmas tree farm and learn about all his conservation efforts. Our 6-year-old daughter enjoyed sleeping in the loft, and daily strolls on the meandering pathways. Roy's place is also an easy drive to so many activities. We brought our bikes and found local trails, adventured furthered out to the trail in Oconomowoc and caught a water ski show as well. The indoor pool at the nearby aquatic center was very nice, as well as the outdoor pool in Fort Atkinson. We also caught a movie at the local theater. We'll have to come back for hang gliding. :-)

One thing that stood out was the fact that this place is accessible. There is a double bed on the main floor and a little ramp from the porch to the grass. If you have trouble walking or use a wheelchair, this cabin is great!
The little commode toilet was also helpful when I did not want to walk out to the outhouse in the middle of the night.
If you want to start camping and want to slowly ease your way into it, this is the best place to start! Perfect “glamping”"

Stayed one night","If you want to get away, to reconnect with nature and maybe yourself, and if you’re okay without indoor plumbing and with electricity that runs on a generator, Ray’s place is an outstanding option. I loved walking the grounds during the day and watching the flames in the woodstove at night. Here’s an example of Ray’s thoughtfulness: he stocks two kinds of wood to burn, one for outside that burns hotter (better for campfires and roasting marshmallows), and seasoned wood for inside, that burns slower."

It was exactly what we hoped for (and the cabin is perfect!).

Roy and Beatrice, his border collie, were great company as he explained the ins and outs of the land he turned from farm fields to a nature conservancy, and a Christmas tree farm. His cabin was beautifully crafted and very comfortable. The pond, fire circle and bridges built across the stream along the paths were a welcome step back into nature after a long winter! I heard a rafter of turkeys and lots of birds singing happily in the trees."

The cabin was beautifully designed with a rustic touch, providing all the necessary amenities for a comfortable stay. The bed was super cozy and the linens were soft and clean. The space was perfect for a couple or small family, with plenty of room to relax and enjoy the peaceful surroundings.
What made our stay truly special was Roy's hospitality. He went above and beyond to ensure that we had everything we needed, providing great tips on local activities and dining options. He even offered to set up a campfire for us to enjoy under the stars.
Overall, I would highly recommend this glamping cabin to anyone looking for a unique and relaxing getaway. The beautiful location, cozy cabin, and friendly host made for a truly unforgettable experience."

Stayed one night","We had a great time staying in the lovely cabin and exploring the property. It's a really relaxing and pleasant place. Between tending to the wood stove, the things to do on the property, and the lack of *good* cell coverage, it's easy to keep your attention away from screens if that's something you're looking for.
Acouple issues cropped up, but Roy was very responsive and friendly in dealing with them. The last guest apparently left quite a mess and Roy still had 5 minutes or so of cleanup left when we got there, but no big deal. The generator had some problems and couldn't produce enough juice for the toaster or hot plate, but Roy towed out a better one immediately.
Roy is very friendly and thoughtful, and getting to know him a bit during check-in and troubleshooting was really nice. He was very attentive whenever we reached out about something, but didn't hover excessively at all.
We had a great time, and might even make our stay a yearly thing."

Went for a solo hike on the paths this morning - it's so quiet! It was too soggy outside for us to enjoy the outdoor fire pit but that's really nicely set up too. And yes, the wood stove DEFINITELY provides enough heat to stay cozy all night, even on a cold December night. Overall this was one of my best Airbnb experiences - I wish we could have stayed much longer!"

The only thing I would recommend is to bring a foam mattress topper or an air mattress as the cabin’s mattress was quite thin and very firm. Other than that I loved everything about my stay and would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to do some Wisconsin glamping!"

It's been magical visiting during different seasons and seeing how the property changes throughout the year. We spent a few hours one day exploring the trails throughout Roy's property, and we enjoyed lots of quality time in the pond trying out the kayaks, tubes, and paddleboat that are free to use there. I’m a bird lover and I saw many species of birds all around the pond. The cabin is cozy but cool in the summer, and fully stocked with supplies. The composting outhouse is clean and close enough to the cabin that it's not too scary at night. 🙂 We were lucky to have clear skies and enjoyed a starry night while relaxing around the campfire. Roy is a kind, friendly, and generous host who has created such a special (and affordable!) place to take a few days away. I would definitely recommend this stay for individuals, couples, or groups."

Would definitely recommend to friends. Nice little escape from everyone, no wifi, little service, and privacy for the two of us.Our only regret was not staying another night. Thank you for everything Roy!"

We could tell he put tons of attention into not only the cabin experience but also the land, a 40 acre tree farm ( with 5,000 trees!) he built and tends by hand. Would def go again and bc of our visit it is our top choice for next years’ Christmas tree."

I say that because you get all the electricity and running water that you want in the city, but then you come here…and take a nice little pause. You work to get the fire going, the electricity going, and appreciate water more :) this is coming from someone who hasn’t gone even camping ! The walk thru the property was lovely and the pond peaceful. Definitely pay a visit if you want to come back to yourself for a weekend."

Stayed a few nights","This was a really great choice for us, just a few Moms getting away for a weekend. Whitewater is ten mins away and has some really nice thrift stores and restaurants.
The house was easy to find and to get into, just as described, nice comfy beds, and VERY clean.
The house backs up to a road but it isn't noisy and feels peaceful. We loved sitting on the front deck and watching the chickens and ducks on the little homestead across the street!
Food recommendations; our first dinner was at 841 Brewhouse, good food with decent sized servings.
Lunch at The Sweet Spot Café which I highly recommend. Delicious food and drinks, and friendly service.
Next dinner was at Second Salem and you should definitely eat there. The food was absolutely divine!
I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place to friends, it was a great experience."

The neighbors' roosters were fun to hear in the morning, though surprisingly, no one heard them from the bedrooms--just from the living room. We also appreciated the hosts' recommendations of Natureland Park, the Rice Lake Nature Trail, and the Duck Inn Supper Club. If you want to head to Kettle Morraine State Forest, this is the perfect location. We also left behind a stuffed animal, and the host reached out to me and offered to send it--above and beyond!!!

It was a girls getaway
We were celebrating my daughter’s 14 bday
The place was peaceful and so close to the lake where we went at night & in the morning.
Nice touch to find a bottle of local wine in the fridge: we loved the wine so much that we stopped at the winery and stock up on few more bottles.
Beds were comfy and linens were soft.
Beautiful bathroom on the top level with a steam shower.
Only thing that maybe we would like to point out is the fact that there was no coffee in the house. We wish we knew. We would have brought our own.
Usually coffee is always provided.
Other than that everything else was perfect.
We can’t wait to stay there again!!
Thank you Joshua"

My six year old nephew loved it as he had lots to do in the house, with all the board games and the fire place outside.
It looks much better than in the pictures, and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a calm yet engaging (trails, kayaking, fire place, etc.) holiday. Above all, the hosts Rebecca and Michael are just superb. They make you feel at home and are always accessible. Lastly, it is a big house and Michael’s craftsmanship and wood work is on display in every aspect of the house."

The rental is the lower floor of the owners' home. I did not find that to be clear in the description. We had the entire lower floor, our own entrance, and a huge patio all to ourselves. There were easy paths through the woods to a tree house and the river, open seating areas, a grill.... it was truly delightful.
The place was sparkling clean, cozy furnishings, well-outfitted kitchen, and comfy beds. The woodwork was gorgeous and done by the owner. We literally stood in front of every door and cabinet marveling!
The owners took us on a pontoon ride on the river, and gave us a history lesson of the area.
We wished we could have stayed longer."

Close enough to town to enjoy stores and restaurants but hidden in the woods by the river. The bridge you can see is for a bike trail; you can hear light highway traffic but can’t see it. All the outdoor features were perfect and we didn’t have to pack anything extra to enjoy a campfire, boating, picnic, and tree house. The kids liked “hiking” on the little trails through the wooded property. The house was clean and lovely, well-stocked with toys, towels and kitchen items. Bedrooms were comfortable and a good size. Host was very friendly, helpful and accommodating. Reasonably priced considering everything that is included. Good location to take day trips to beach, biking and hiking. Highly recommend for a family with kids or just adults who want to relax in nature, in comfort!"

The woodwork has been handcrafted from trees on the property and is unique and spectacular. It is a pleasure to enjoy such detail in care and creativity! We cannot say enough about what a marvelous place this is! Rebecca and Michael are kind and gracious people. We came as strangers but left as friends. We cannot wait to return!"

Stayed a few nights","The hosts are incredibly welcoming, helping us with our bags, questions about kayaking and the surrounding area. They live in the upstairs accommodations but you will barely notice them if you wish. The home is incredibly peaceful and the perfect location for a small family vacation."

Stayed with kids","We had a delightful family getaway at our host’s home. An incredibly serene spot in a nature reserve, where flora and fauna abound. Patio areas of the home were beautifully decorated, perfect for reading, conversation or dinner on the grill.
The home is spacious and decorated with a mix of art and comfort. Upon entering, you are greeted with coffee and teas. Don’t worry, if you think you’ve forgotten something, most likely it’s already there, from bug spray to sunscreen, plentiful games, books or binoculars, the hosts have it all covered. The kayaks and firepit were such fun and the river a peaceful respite from busy city life.
Michael and Rebecca were kind and generous hosts with a wealth of knowledge to share. From the lookout tower to a magical tiny cabin, we found our stay to be an incredible all around."

Stayed a few nights","Comfortable, cozy, canoes, and kayaks! I was fortunate to be their very first booking at this location and expected a couple things to be missing or looked over. The apartment had everything and then some! A full use kitchen complete with sharp knives and cutlery (extremely rare at BnBs), extra spices olive oil and sugar, extra towels (even robes!), artistic decor, comfortable beds & couches, beautiful river views complete with a fire pit, kayaks and canoes to use (+ life vests), and as an added bonus to the well curated grounds is a tree house to escape any insects and bring in the sunrise/sunset from 30' up. Would have stayed longer if I had the time, highly recommend!!"
