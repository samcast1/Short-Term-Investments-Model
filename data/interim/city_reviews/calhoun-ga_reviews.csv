Stayed with a pet","Absolutely beautiful stay! The location is private/quiet and it was exactly what I needed to decompress and disconnect for a few days. The greenhouse was light & airy, well equipped and very comfortable. I enjoyed the covered porch on a rainy morning and the stroll around the pond. I would definitely stay here again! The host was super friendly and accommodating."

Stayed with a pet","We had a lovely stay at The Greenhouse! We got in late and found everything as described – parking, courtesy lanterns to find our spot, peaceful chirping of crickets and croaking of a bullfrog, and the coziest little dwelling nestled into the woods.
The site was charming and cozy. The windows were left open, the fresh air was wonderful, and the temperature was perfect! We (and our pup) tucked in for the night and awoke to the sunrise and peaceful pond out our front window. We made coffee by the camp stove and enjoyed it by the fire pit. (We didn't take advantage of the provided firewood, but appreciated the fact that it was there if we wanted it!)
We sat enjoying ourselves thoroughly, discussed how fun it would be to come back with friends and rent out all three dwellings on the property, and dreamt of how dreamy hosting a fireside Thanksgiving feast would be here."

Stayed with kids","Our family enjoyed our stay in the greenhouse so much! We fished, cooked dinner over the fire, and the best part was hanging out and making s’mores with the kids outside without tvs and tablets. We woke up the next morning and it was pouring. Lewis was so kind to give us a later check out for the rain to slack up so we could load our truck up. Staying here was the neatest experience and definitely recommend to anyone looking to get a small break from this crazy world. Thank y’all again!"

Stayed with a pet","The tiny house is very cute and easy to find, and it’s not far from some beautiful places. The host is helpful and responsive. (And they allow pets - yay! :) Also the foot pump water dispenser is a plus. I did not have time to use the telescope, but I think that is a thoughtful addition. That said, some things to note. 1. The heat was just a portable buddy heater, rated safe for indoor use, but not really made for living quarters. Beware, it may shut off in the night and refuse to re-light. Turn it off before you sleep. 2. The kitchenette is actually a Coleman camping stove. Personally I think using one indoors is sketchy, though I guess it would be OK if you open the window/door. 3. If you are bringing food, know that the luggage cart provided will not accommodate any but the tiniest of coolers."

Stayed a few nights","This was an amazing trip, beautiful location, and great hosts. If you’re looking for a quiet little getaway away with access to fishing on the property it’s definitely the place for you. The little cabin was cozy and had everything we needed to be comfortable for a few days. The pond on site was loaded with some of the biggest bluegill and panfish I have ever caught and plenty of bass as well. We had a blast catching and releasing more fish than we could count over the course of our visit. Unfortunately due to bad weather we had to cut our stay short but we can’t wait to come back!"

The fact that s’mores kits are provided was such a nice and tasty touch. The only thing to note is that the greenhouse is not quite as surrounded by trees as in the the photos suggest.

Stayed with a pet","This peaceful little Georgia greenhouse gave us the perfect excuse to have a quiet getaway. Just as adorable as the pictures, this tiny home offers a comfy bed and roof over your head instead of a tent. It did get hot during the day, so utilize the fan provided!
I will say there were a lot of bugs (to be expected, as it's right at the edge of the woods) so bring that bug spray! Quite a few big spiders were seen.
We loved that this place was Dog Friendly so we going bring our Lab with us on this Georgia adventure.
My husband caught a couple fish in the pond (catch and release of course!) and we enjoyed the peaceful sounds of nature surrounding us.
This place is perfect for a 2 night stay in North Georgia. There isn't much around, so buy your supplies before you get there. There are no outlets in the greenhouse so bring a powerbank with you to charge any electronics.
Overall, we enjoyed our peaceful stay at Rolling Ridge!"

The only thing was that we didn’t pack enough water so needed to ran just before dusk. Also, be ready to run out the phone battery. Recommending to check all the QR code instructions before losing all the phone batteries.
Fishing and fire pit was fun!"

No bugs or spiders. We enjoyed having a fire and walking the pond and listening to the nature! We saw a group of turkeys that came by our site a few different times which was super cool. The stars are absolutely breathtaking at night. And we had a small lighting storm that was jaw dropping to see from inside!
Would recommend to anyone and definitely plan to come back but in the winter when it’s not so hot!"

A warning for summer visitors, the cabin can get a bit hot during the day but opening the windows in the evening helps. Also if rainstorms pass through it can get a bit loud on the roof. But the view of the lighting through the windows was beautiful! The amenities were really thoughtful and it was a perfect place to disconnect and relax."

The place can be difficult to find at night as the address provided sent me to an empty lot. No matter, though, because Shannon had sent me directions and pictures of the area at night so I could easily find my way! She was very communicative even late at night. The place was very comfortable and my dog enjoyed his morning walk saying hi to the cows and other animals on property. Luke, their ranch-hand, was also very welcoming and helpful. Very safe area in North Georgia."

I am very appreciative of Shannon letting me and Wednesday stay here. Shannon was very friendly, responsive and let me feed a calf!

Farm fresh eggs greeted me along with cows, donkeys and geese! The surroundings were amazing…less than 2 miles from multiple waterfalls and crystal clear creeks. The sun setting over the mountain was beautiful and the 5 minute drive to the top of the mountain looking out over “The Pocket” was breathtaking. I never locked my doors. I just felt very safe here. I had no fear that my work equipment would get stolen. I can’t wait to bring my wife and kids back here. This is going to become a routine stay when I need to “get away”."

Stayed a few nights","This was a perfect spontaneous last minute stay for my partner and I. Nestled in the woods , we couldn’t get enough of the hammocks on the back porch and not to mention the hot tub. I’m sure this cabin is beautiful during the winter considering the fireplace available inside. The kitchen was well equipped and the grocery store was only 10 minutes up the road. We took a day trip to Chattanooga and rode the incline trolley up the mountain side. The aesthetic and architecture was very pleasing, we would return in a heartbeat and have already shared this listing with multiple family members and friends. Jody was very welcoming and answered any questions we had in a timely manner."

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I booked this place for our two year anniversary and it was perfect. About an hour and 15 minute drive to the Atlanta aquarium and plenty of good food options in the area even though the actual Airbnb is very secluded.
You can tell Jody, the host, really knows what she’s doing. We never had an issue with anything and we never had to reach out because she communicated the details about the trip so well. The treehouse was extremely clean (which was impressive being in the woods) and it was filled with a bunch of cool little activities and things to discover. My wife and I are in our mid 20s and we thought it was super fun, so I can’t imagine how much more fun kids would have exploring the cabin.
The back deck and hot tub were great. We saw a bunch of squirrels, a cardinal trying to make its nest on the porch, and a few deer run by while we were in the hot tub.
100% would recommend, we will be coming back."

Stayed a few nights","The Forester Treehouse was the absolute breath of fresh air my wife and I needed to unplug from the world for a couple of days. The treehouse was beautiful, thoughtfully decorated and serene. There was a wonderful rain storm one night and we fell asleep in the loft bed to the sound of the rain on the metal roof. Spent time in the swing chairs on the back porch and enjoyed the hot tub. Jody was so thoughtful. We arrived a few minutes early while Jody was still at the treehouse. She spent a few minutes with us and walked us through the space, sharing how the treehouse came to be and some of the materials that were used. We met our co-host, Edna, the next morning and was delighted to find out her name was originally Ed until she had puppies... now Ed is Edna, lol. The only issue we had was that we had not planned a long enough stay. We will be visiting again and will definitely stay longer than 2 nights. We felt comfortable and right at home!"

Stayed with kids","I read other reviews & pretty much everyone is spot on! Very clean, cozy w a real treehouse feel! Tree details r everywhere we looked! Welcome basket of snacks was a hit & so appreciated! The little touches don’t go unnoticed.
Being 100% wood floors & we had their sweet dog, Edna visit outside on the property it’s a bummer we weren’t able to bring our little guy but also understand the liability w allowing dogs in your home. Obviously that wasn’t a deal breaker by any means.
The host does live on the property as well as a shared drive w 2 other property’s
they rent out. In the summer there would be more privacy except for the one unit facing ours but not a a huge deal Just know your not deep in woods feel But still felt secluded enough. Jody and her husband were very quick to respond to any questions that we had before and during our stay. They do come to the house to personally welcome you which is nice but I never had that before so took me by surprise.

As far as the space itself, the decorations are incredible, and if you don’t pay attention you may miss all this place has to offer. For example, the big tree in the living room lights up, which makes for an even better stay. The hot tub was perfect for the cold weather, and the book of restaurants and “things to do” were helpful. Will definitely be returning in the future!"

The pictures do not do it justice, there is SO much beautiful craftsmanship here… you just have to see it for yourself. Cute decor, amazing comfy beds, relaxing porch & hot tub. As long as Jody is renting this place, we hope to make it a tradition to be back every year. It was the perfect little get away.
The only complaint we had (which isn’t even really a complaint, bc we didn’t mind) but figured I’d say to let others know. If you’re a light sleeper, booking in the fall with rain/wind may not be the best, as acorns and stuff constantly fall on the tin roof. However, the beds are so comfy that it’s easy to ignore and get right to sleep.
10/10 recommend"

Feels like you’re way out of the city. The beds are comfy and linens and towels very clean and cozy. The host was very responsive. Lots of games and outdoor spaces, kept kids entertained.
Helpful tips for others to know:
Wi-Fi is not the best, so I wouldn’t plan of streaming or working/homework (it was better at times than others) no signal for t-mobile but the Wi-Fi worked for internet based texting.
Recommend bringing your own food and spices as kitchen is well stocked with appliances and few restaurants in the immediate area- plus, why would you want to leave?
We already want to go back."

Swinging fun pod hammocks to gaze at the forrest from. Interesting design and antiques everywhere! I can not overstate this. And thought-out. Hand towel just where you’d expect. Need a hook? It’s exactly where you think. It’s giving soft, tidy, interesting, memorable, fun."

Stayed a few nights","This is my favorite AirBnB that I have ever stayed in. Tucked away in the small, quiet town of Adairsville, this place is the perfect getaway for anyone needing a place to truly relax and unplug. There is a reason it’s called a forest tree house - you truly have tons of privacy surrounded by trees and nature! The back porch is stunning and I took a nice nap on one of the hammock swings. The hot tub was perfect for winding down at the end of the day. All of the decor inside was so magical and homey, and the different lighting is such an incredible added touch to the space. Everything was extremely clean and clearly well-maintained.
The only downside I would say is that you won’t have much cell service and the wifi isn’t great. This was far from a dealbreaker and I quite enjoyed being forced to be unplugged! There are going to be bugs since you are surrounded by so many trees and lush forestry - not inside, but definitely outside. Bring bug spray and remember to keep the doors closed!"

The jacuzzi on the balcony is private and year round. A little fire pit in the back yard. I would recommend to bring a small grill if you are not going to eat out. A decent amount of food options near by. 20-30 minute drive to nearby stores.
Will be back."

Stayed a few nights","I’ve stayed at roughly 15 Airbnbs, several private rentals, tons of hotels (fancy and not so fancy), and grew up in family cabins. Jody’s treehouse is in my top 3 locations . One of other locations was in Hawaii, and another in Spain. That should tell you how much we loved this place. Super clean, cozy, and attention to detail made this place fantastic. Once we arrived we altered our plans so we could just hang out there for entire stay. I’m a huge fan of cabins or similar places and Jody’s is top tier. Private, peaceful, and just the right space for a romantic retreat. The only drawback is food preparation. We made do the hot plates provided, but a grill would be a welcomed attention. Otherwise nearly perfect stay. If we ever pass through Georgia again, we’ll be sure to see if the Treehouse is available."

Jody was very responsive to my questions about accessibility, even sending extra photos so I could see how far Mom would have to walk. If you have someone who wants to experience a treehouse but has limited mobility, this is an amazing find! There is an entrance that works with a walker and a bed on the main floor. If you like a treehouse challenge, the second bed is up a spiral staircase that is truly beautiful! A lot of care and craftsmanship went into this treehouse. My Mom (and I!) loved the twinkly lights on the tree trunk behind the cozy gas fireplace! I'll be back!"

It was hard to find in the dark and is located behind a couple building with a shared driveway. The neighbor had a light on that in the winter, shined through the window directly into the bed area. The air unit was a little noisy at night and made a rattling sound every now and then and getting the temp right at night seemed tough. Lots of little remotes for things so it took a while to figure out what went with what. Lots of discovery work on that end.
Overall we really enjoyed our stay!"

Stays close to everything but yet completely secluded we felt like we were just in our own little bubble. Jody is the perfect host, we had everything we needed, and she always responded immediately if we had a question even prior to the trip highly recommended, and we will be booking for next year!"

There are tons of nature scenes to explore with the river being right down the hill from the cabin. You don't get the sense that there would be restaurants and grocery stores 15 minutes away from you but there was a little town right up the road that had everything we needed. Would love to come back sometime and explore more of the surrounding area!

The teens enjoyed the downstairs area and we all enjoyed fishing in the pond and pavilion to BBQ and sit by the fire. We took walks and fished everyday and you can't beat enjoying your morning coffee sitting out on the porch to take in all the views. If I had one complaint it would be that there were more kitchen equipment to use for larger groups but we managed by taking advantage of the BBQ and the restaurants around the area. We would love to stay again.

It allowed each family member to enjoy each other and as well as spend time doing whatever they please. The children in our group enjoyed the game room and having their own space. With a theater , refrigerator and living space (being boys this was ideal)
The master bedroom is beautiful and romantic . All of the rooms was comfortable. This cabin help us to enjoy Christmas had a meal and played fun games. The cabin was also beautifully decorated to accommodate the Christmas season and was very tasteful for our family photos. This cabin is also very spacious inside & out. This cabin was very clean the beds are very comfortable. The fire places made it very special . Moreover this cabin was very affordable, it allowed us to chose to stay in or go out if we choose because of their nearby stores and restaurants. There is also a lot of history in the area. We love it & will be back"

There were good quality restaurants located right off the exit (Olive Garden, Longhorn, etc.). This was an overnight on the way home from Florida and it was fantastic to have a peaceful, comfortable home setting to rest in instead of a hotel! This is getting added to my favorites for future trips! The host sent a great note ahead of time with instructions. I had no trouble getting in or out!"

The space was clean and beautifully decorated. We appreciated the comfortable furniture for relaxing in the evenings after busy days with our grandkids! The well-equipped kitchen allowed us to make many meals at home, but there were plenty of nearby restaurants when we chose to eat out. Christy & Matt are wonderful, responsive hosts and we highly recommend both of their listings."

Stayed one night","words canot express my gratitude, joy, peace and solitude staying at Jody's. Not only was she extremely communicative but accommodating to our late arrival and need for an extra hour the next morning. This literally felt like I slept a night away from home at home but I am a country girl who is daily surrounded by trees and wildlife and that is what you will find here. There are neighboring rentals bit with the surrounding trees it wasn't a problem. Saw deer as we traveled in.. so yes, right at home. I bet if you stay more than one night you would see even more. The linens, the kitchen, the snacks, coffee and tea were all very thoughtful touches. I loved the flameless candles, the local, vintage, and nature themed art, and the vintage furniture along with whiteboard walls. Again, I cannot say enough the describe our stay. We LOVED IT!! Off the beaten path which is perfect for us. We will definitely stay here again if ever back in the area again."

The place was clean, cozy and was set up well with everything I needed while there. GPS gets you almost all the way there, if you read the mailbox #s there’s no issue. The bed was too firm for what I am used to but personal preference I’d say. I was only there for two nights on business but I really appreciated that she has a binder of things to do in the surrounding areas plus the snack/coffee stock she keeps for guests. I would definitely stay again or look at one of the other cool cabin-y stays she offers as well in there area."

The modern farmhouse decor was beautiful and relaxing. The large windows around the perimeter of the cabin allow the morning sunlight to light the place as it filters through the surrounding trees. The bedding was so comfortable and really gave the place a lush feeling. The cabin was exceptionally clean & the bathroom was stocked with plenty of towels and washcloths. For the purpose of our trip, the location was superbly located between Blankets Creek MTB trails and Jarrod’s Place (and as a bonus was only a beautiful, 20 minute country drive to downtown historic Rome, which has plentiful restaurants and eateries.) I can’t recommend this Air BNB enough & hope to return one day! ❤️"

Stayed one night","We were looking for a private place to stay close to taking our son to college in Atlanta. We didn’t want to have to take everything out of the car at a hotel for fear of our car broken into. Location was out of way. Felt safe and private. We also decided on an Airbnb same evening we needed to stay and only one night. Jody was very responsive, kind and let us check in two after after reservation. Even pulled the sofa out and made it. Great stay. Would again for sure."

I had much-needed R&R and will keep this place on my short list of great getaways to take when a change of sceneryis needed.
Jody was an awesome host, giving friendly, clear instructions to get to her place and into the stay.
I highly recommend!"

My husband, who is generally more critical than I am about Airbnb stays, remarked, ""I wouldn't change ANYTHING about this one!"" The super-quiet setting was beautifully woodsy, with lovely trees and rolling hills. The roomy and yet cozy cabin, with its beautiful large windows and views and its deep, shady porch with rockers reminded me of my grandparents' house in my childhood. Thanks, Jody, for all the labor that went into this place!"

Stayed a few nights","If I could leave more stars, I would. Jody is an amazing host!
As someone who used to live in a similar region, I have a great appreciation for the type of accommodations that were provided.
Jody's response time is exceptionally quick as her responses are genuine and thorough. Her availability to be on the scene as well as answer any and all questions and concerns is very appreciative. I would also like to thank her for being explicitly thorough with her directions in regards to finding the Airbnb location.
If you want a quiet, country, and remote little cabin for a quick romantic getaway or even for just a few nights on your own, this is the place you want to be. Its location is settled between two major highways; so - you have the option of not only going out and venturing amongst the locals, but thanks to Jody's guidebook, you can also venture out further and find amazing places to eat as well as various activities to do year-round.
The cabin is amazingly beautiful and secure. Those pictures are not lying; if anything, it does no justice as far as showing the true gem of what a beauty that place really is. you can tell that from the craftsmanship, to the layout, to the decorations; there was nothing but love poured into that place as that is the first thing you feel as soon as you come onto the premises. Also, due to the type of accommodations that are provided, I also felt a great sense of safety being there.
If you're lucky, you will be greeted by the most adorable little dog. She will wait for you at the door as she appreciates ear rubs and tummy rubs.
This is definitely a place I have plans on visiting again."

Stayed a few nights",This place felt completely like home. I travel for work and I really loathe staying in a hotel. The little drive up the road is wooded and makes you feel like you are really slipping away to a little secluded cabin. I pulled up on my second night and was greeted by the sweetest little pup which made my entire day. Made missing my pups a little easier. The bed is super comfy. Jody has all kinds of little extras that made it so nice. I came in straight from home the first night after 10pm and there were snacks out which was great since I didn’t have time to stop and get food before I came. I’ve rebooked for the rest of my work time here in Rome. It stays booked up so if it’s open when you’re seeing this rush to the reserve button!

Stayed a few nights","We truly can not say enough good things about this rental. Lovely, cozy, organized, unique, and clean are just a few words that come to mind when you walk in this lovely cottage style rental.
This host has thought of her guests with every detail. All the way from the snack basket to the air purifer and the washer and dryer. She has made this charming space a sanctuary for travelers.
Set in the country just enough to feel like your in your own world but not too far out that you feel isolated.
Renting in the past has been somewhat disappointing at times. I thought maybe our standards were too high and what we were expecting was not really attainable. However, after renting from Jody we now know that it is very much attainable, and she has spoiled us for future travel.
If you are close yo this area and need a rental look no further than this little treasure.

The place was super cute and very clean. Our toddler loved that we were out in the woods and that he got to sleep in the same room as us (he slept on the half bed in the living room area). Shower, etc., all worked well, and there were extra sheets and blankets if needed. We are a little covid-crazy and asked Jody to open up all the windows after the last guest left so the place could air out, which she did:-) Would definitely stay here again while traveling through."

It was perfect for what we needed! We used it only to sleep after the concert before heading home early the next morning so we didn’t get the full experience but I would definitely recommend it.
Only thing to consider is that even though it holds 4 guests, there is an additional charge for each guest over two. I didn’t realize that when I booked, so the price ended up being a bit more than I originally thought. Not a game changer, but I have not encountered with an Airbnb rental before."

Little extra touches like snacks and thoughtful/tasteful decor were really nice, and it's clear that the hosts take their role seriously. There isn't a stove, which wouldn't have surprised me if I had looked more carefully at pictures and amenities. This wasn't an issue at all--there's a two-burner hot plate, microwave, coffee pot, etc.--but it might be something for travelers to keep in mind if you plan to cook."

Stayed a few nights","Ben's place was LOVELY. And SO PEACEFUL. The rooms were spacious, everything looked brand new, and there was so much space to put our stuff.
We asked Ben for a donut shop recommendation and the place he sent us was GREAT (""Fresh Donuts""): good every day selection, with added surprises like jalapeno.
But the really memorable aspect of our visit - which was to attend our daughter's wedding over in Calhoun - was Ben's super friendliness and hospitality. We flew in late Thursday and managed to get off on the wrong foot that first night by driving our rental car right into a ditch before we had even arrived. We called Ben and he drove out to helps us, but he was beaten by some other Good Samaritan who pulled off the highway and used a winch on his jeep to extract us: Jason Miles, of Adairsville. If you know him, thank him AGAIN for us. First we were mortified and then we were GRATEFUL. Ben and everyone else were so nice about telling us that EVERYBODY drives into ditches all the time - like it was a Local Tradition. We have our doubts.
Anyway, all I can say us that I wish I had had more time to hang out, but Wedding Festivities consumed almost all of our weekend. Each night when we dragged in past midnight, it was such a JOY to come home to Ben's place."

Christy was great in all her communications and had local recommendations in a binder for us.
The neighborhood is calm and quiet. The lot is large and the grounds were well maintained.
The kitchen was stocked, 2 TVs in the place, games, a work desk.
You could live here and be just a couple of minutes from almost anything you might need.

Stayed one night","Wow! Five-star accommodations. Need I say more? The cottage is a tranquil place that provides everything a traveler needs and more. The hosts (Christy and Matt) are very hospitable and flexible. They kindly accepted our impromptu booking and were flexible with our need for a 4 a.m. arrival time with same-day evening departure. They went the extra-mile in providing excellent hospitality, as they had the porch light and some house lights on for us when we arrived, as well as had bought some white bath towels for us given that we have allergies to the colored-dye bath towels they had for their guests. We slept like a baby in the extremely comfortable bed with wondeful linens, which was also due in part to the fact that they allow their guests to control the thermostat in the cottage! And, we also enjoyed being able to do our laundry on the premises while we looked at all of the literature they provided for the local area including eateries we had not heard of before as former Daltonians."

The home was decorated for Christmas which lead me and my partner to buy gingerbread houses to decorate. I will say it got very very cold especially in the morning. I realized it’s because the AC had been turned off in the night and wasn’t set to start again until 6pm that day but that’s bad on my part. Other than that it was a nice stay. Would’ve definitely visit again.

The street has private homes, so it is very quiet during the day and at night. You will also be very close to everything you need, supermarkets, and restaurants, and it is less than 10 minutes from the Dalton Convention center.

We previously stayed at a hotel and this time decided to stay at this Airbnb and it was the best decision we could have made and changed my whole outlook on the city of Dalton. The bed was luxurious and so comfortable with the softest sheets, the kitchen was fully stocked with everything you might need, the added touches of a washer/dryer/detergent, shampoo/conditioner/body wash and the book about Dalton and things to do was just the topping on the cake. I highly recommend this sweet house and we will definitely stay again!!!"

Stayed a few nights","This cozy little cottage was in a handy location in Dalton! Is was as advertised with modern updates to this small home and had a nice fully furnished kitchen. its decor is eclectic, mixing the old and new features in this house, like the original wood flooring in the bedroom. We had everything two people needed! Christy, the host communicated really well and was very friendly and helpful! Price was very reasonable especially when you compare what you get for the money! I'd recommend it!"
