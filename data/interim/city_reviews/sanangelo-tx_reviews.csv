Stayed a few nights","We were pleasantly surprised to find the house met, or exceeded the look of the pictures. Because we brought our 2 Corgis, it was nice to find the back yard well kept…others haven’t been. The neighborhood was very pretty, making us feel secure. It took a while for the AC to catch up with the high temps, but it did! My husband told me I did good in choosing this house…we were very comfortable there, and since our grandson will be in college in San Angelo, we would certainly stay there again if Lindsey will have us!"

Lindsey's place was perfect. The host was super quick & responsive to all our minor questions! House was perfect for our kiddos, infant & pets.
I oved the back yard early in the morning while drinking a cup of coffee & rocking thr baby..
I highly recommend this place over a hotel stay anytime!"

Stayed with a pet","Being from out of town, we needed a place to stay for our daughter's wedding. The house was perfect. We were able to host family coming in from out of town, had room to spread out to do wedding prep, and we were centrally located for easy access to shopping and getting to the airport. The back yard was perfect for Stella, and comfortable for hanging out. Not that I needed anything, as the house had everything I needed for our trip, but Lindsey was quick to respond to my messages. I definitely recommend Lindsey's place for your trip!"

Stayed with a pet",This was a very beautiful home for our week long trip. We have a 1 and 2 year old and the backyard with playground equipment was extremely helpful to keep them happy outside of their home. I always appreciate when a home will allow us to bring in our furbabies and the neighborhood was very calm to take them for a walk. The home was very spacious and we did not have any complaints about our stay in the home.

Bedrooms and bathrooms are well appointed, the living room is a great gathering place, and the kitchen dining area is bright and inviting. (The dining area might be a bit cramped for more than 4 people - but not terribly so). The backyard has swings and slides, and is fenced in, with a nice deck with chairs so kids can play and adults can relax and keep an eye on them. Lindsey is an awesome communicator! Very responsive. I would utilize this air bnb again for sure!"

Group trip","Candace’s place is well located! Here are my two cents:
- We had an issue trying to get in since the keypad code didn’t work. We messaged her and she responded within 20 minutes, so very quick.
- Although the house is for 8 people, keep in mind that there is one bathroom which is not optimal but if you don’t mind this, then it’s a great place to stay at.
- The house is nicely decorated and you’ll feel relaxed in it as it’s clean and airy. When we arrived, the AC was already on so it felt nice come into a cool house. However, I wish it had some amenities like plates for 8 people or an iron and ironing board.
- Candace was very nice to communicate with!
- Some of my family members told me that two of the beds were a little hard but that’s subjective.
- The house is about 4 minutes away from ASU, it’s a great location in a chill neighborhood close to everything!
Overall, we’ll stay here again! It’s a lovely home and the overall experience was pretty good!"

Group trip",It’s an old home but then again the entire town seems to only consist of older homes. The rooms were decent sizes but every bed creeks as they are all metal. The doors in the home are hard to close if they even closed at all. The light shines in so bright in the morning so you won’t be able to sleep in. I did notice that there were some air mattress available which is nice although we did not use. The kitchen is dated and the faucet in the kitchen has very little water pressure. A/C worked well. I did see a large roach in the back bathroom but it’s an old wooden home and it didn’t feel like it was the worst of our stay. I would say the worse is the doors not closing so you don’t have privacy. Also asking a guest to take the trash bins to the end of the road for you is just not hospitable. Washer and dryer worked well. Wouldn’t stay here again but then again probably wouldn’t come back to visit that town again either. Sorry.

Downside: older houses usually aren’t insulated well. The floors were freezing (it was February). If you stay in the winter or cooler months, bring your slippers. We did need to keep it fairly warm during the day if we were there just to cut the draft. Nothing to blame the owner for by any means.
Otherwise it’s a cute house, good location. Quiet neighborhood."

Stayed with kids","The house is as described and taken care of on the inside for an older updated house. The house would be better described as sleeps 8. I would say for being charged a cleaning fee that I would expect it to have been cleaned before our arrival. There was a noticeable smell, be it dogs or some other odor that was apparent. The house floors were clean but left obvious dust on the bottom of socks. There was also no wash cloths on site in any cabinets that we found. All in all it’s an okay stay in a good location, convenient to the highway and attractions."

Host emailed me about noise detector detecting too loud. we did have 11 people in our group, 8 adults and 3 small kids. i guess instead of board games we should have played the quiet game.

Stayed with kids","Arrival: after a long, long day of travel we arrived and couldn't find the home. Maps said we arrived but the house isn't clearly marked. We finally flipped a U-turn and took a look at the mailbox to find the address. We piled out of the car to dash to the restroom and had to dig up the door code. It was sent on the day of booking but not the day of arrival and it was buried in all the other messages. Cleanliness: zero stars. A washer and dryer are available for use but I had to empty both to use them. The dryer had damp towels and the washer had rags. My niece put fresh socks on when she woke and after 30 they were black on the bottom. My wash rag had hair on it as did the shower walls. The owner did refund me the cleaning fee. The best part of this area is the Buttercup cafe. This home is barebones. It sleeps many but only a few can have coffee as it's only a 5-cup maker so be prepared to make multiple pots. A nightly rate of $225-$250 is more fitting, I feel cheated."

Stayed with kids","The house is spacious and the host was very communicative which we appreciate. However we did experience some maintenance issues during our stay such as the guest bathtub was draining very slowly- too slow to take a shower, and the master bath drain isn’t low enough so the water pools and there was still a stagnant puddle 24 hours after use. The toilet seat in the master bath was not secured to the toilet and there were no toiletries supplied- no shampoo or even bar soap in the showers. The streets outside are well lit but because there are no darkening shades in the bedrooms there was a lot of light coming in at night. We were also disappointed there weren’t some basic items stocked like a blow dryer or wine glasses.
The maintenance items seem easy enough to fix- hopefully the host can address them for future guests."

We will definitely be booking here again!!"

Stayed with kids","A large group of us were visiting San Angelo for an annual family reunion. John’s home was selected because it provide enough bedrooms for the couples and then enough beds for the single adults and children in the group. We were all thrilled at the spaciousness of the he house, with 8 adults, 1 teen and two toddlers, we never felt cramped!
Communicating with John was exceptionally easy. He responded quickly before we made our reservations, and answered questions quickly afterwards. While we were on property, he initiated emails to make sure all was acceptable. I really appreciated this touch.
A few in our group were more than a little concerned about Covid precautions. Well it would be safe to say that they looked at the house with a critical eye as to it’s cleanliness. The house was immaculate. Seriously, for such a large home, it was CLEAN. Kudos to John and his team for that.
This wasn’t our first time using a VRBO or AirBnB, but it was one of the best times!"

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at the riverwalk bungalow was perfect! It really was the best part of our stay! I don’t really want to share this little slice of comfort! I was a bit nervous about the area overall and I felt so safe at this place. They had a private entrance with private gate that we closed each night and felt secure and never heard a sound. If you have a larger vehicle it might be a tight fit but our car fit perfectly. The unit itself is super clean and inviting, a perfect modern homey feel. The bed and linens and pillows were literally amazing I’ve never slept so good outside my own home! The snacks were a great touch. Overall no complaints and when we come back to visit my sister we will definitely try and book again! I can’t imagine this place having availability it’s the best place in town! Book this spot you won’t regret it. Thank you guys again for a great stay."

Stayed a few nights","The River Walk Bungalow was a great place to rest during my family visit to San Angelo. The building and furnishings were incredibly comfortable. The outside temperatures ranged from the high of 88 º to low of 52º (with rain) during my stay. I only used the ceiling fans a couple of times. The location is very quiet. The rental matches the photos. It’s a short walk from the Riverwalk or downtown area. The immediate neighborhood is not maintained well, but I always felt safe. Communication with the hosts was quick and responsive. If you want to be in central San Angelo, this is a great rental. I would request this Airbnb when I return."

Thankfully we brought my car (VW Atlas) because if we would have been in my husbands full size pick up truck it would have been very hard to park.
Overall we loved it, and now our son wants us to find something like this to rent him for his last year at ASU."

Long before we ever made it to our trip, Dave and Annette were very helpful and accommodating with our schedule as we had to change our check in and our check out day! The instructions on how to get to their property were clear and concise, and we felt right at home! There were the comfiest amenities and the best night sleep we have had in a long time! The linens and the mattress were exceptional… To the point of me messaging them and asking if they could give me details! The bathroom was perfectly stocked with everything that I could need from toiletries to a real blow dryer ( ladies you know what I mean) , a steamer, which in my opinion is so much better than an iron and beautiful white towels! The little Living Room kitchen was also great! Stocked with coffee and water and a few little snacks just were some great touches that you don’t always see! HIGHLY recommend, & next time we are in San Angelo we would gladly book again!"

I will say for other guests who choose to stay, a F250 truck- you will not be able to close the gate in front of the Airbnb.l to enclose your vehicle with the house property. Other than that it was quick, easy, & beautiful. Our favorites were the fireplace, and the bed was like a cloud. Shower was spacious and pretty and spic & span!
I must say we LOVED it for just us two.

Stayed a few nights","Dawn’s place was super cute and reminded me of Marfa/Alpine with its cute decor! I have to agree with a previous review about the water pressure being too low. Also, we messaged Dawn about the door knob being loose due to missing screws, which made it hard to close the door, at one point I couldn’t get the door open from the inside but we never got a response about this. Having stayed in a lot of airbnbs, this was the first one where there was an abundance of fees for damaging or losing stuff. It kind of put us off and left a sour taste, but oh well. We still had a great time and like I said, this place is super adorable! We didn’t encounter any outside noise but we did have the room in the back. There’s also some kind of water pump underneath the a/c that would make loud noises every so often. I would still recommend this place! It’s just down the street from all the nice restaurants and bars."

Stayed a few nights","We decided to make a quick weekend trip to San Angelo to escape the monotony of our small town. This cute Airbnb exceeded our expectations. We had never been out this way before, and the Airbnb was extremely easy to find. It is extremely walkable to the gym, bars and restaurants down the street, yet far enough to not hear much noise at all.
The Airbnb itself was cute, clean, and made us feel right at home. The kitchen has a microwave, toaster oven, and a hot plate so you could cook something up if you so desired. The only complaint we had during our stay here was the water pressure in the shower was low, but it wasn’t a big deal to us.
If you’re looking for a place downtown to stay, consider this Airbnb!"

Stayed a few nights","I will start out by saying that Dawn was amazing with communication, the place was super cute. However the stairs to get up to the place were very narrow and steep, this was not indicated in the description, and sadly I have a lung condition that made it near impossible to get up and down. The walls are VERY thin and you can hear the other room showering and walking and I know they could hear us. I was there to visit my 17 yo son whom stayed with me and on the first night we got a message about the noise level. We were laughing and being a family but because the thins walls it was a disruption to the guests in the other room. We did end up checking out early the next day and stayed at a local Hotel, as I really could not get up and down those stairs comfortably.
So with that being said this is a great place if you are just wanting some solitude and sleep. It is close to the up and coming arts district so great for walking as well!"

Perfect room for 1-2 people, easy to walk places or the river walk is a very short drive away. We got custom boots at RL Mercer down the road, went to Blaine's Pub for a couple if ice cold beers in tall mugs, had great pizza on the river and then walked all that off on the lovely river walk! Then got to come back to our cozy place for a quiet, restful night's sleep. Good A/C, full kitchen if you want to cook, comfy bed, in the back of the building so it was quiet. I recommend it!"

Dave’s Airbnb was an absolute dream for our recent family reunion! We came in from 3-different states, and their beautiful residence provided the perfect home base for our get-together.
The house was plenty spacious for the family with plenty of room for everyone to relax and spread out. What truly impressed us was their willingness to accommodate our multi-state family and its central location to downtown They provided us with a flexible check-in to meet different arrival/departure times and answered all our questions and concerns in an hour or less.
Overall, we can't recommend Dave and Annette's home highly enough. Their beautiful home, thoughtful touches, and outstanding hospitality made our family reunion truly unforgettable Thank you Dave & Annette!"

Dave’s place was perfect for our needs, close to stores and places to eat.
Very close as well to the State park where I did some hiking, and as well very close to the river walk area.
The home was clean and cool upon arrival and met all of our expectations. Easy to get into as instructions were easy.
Also we drove to San Antonio and spent a day at Sea World, only about a 3 hour drive from Dave’s place. Very happy with our choice, would stay with Dave again in the future. The home had everything we needed to make our stay awesome.
Thanks again"

The house has been updated…somewhat of a ‘modern’ vibe, which we love. Both bedrooms had King beds & both had flat screen TVs, which was a criteria for us, as our kids joined us. The bathroom had ample room…shelving, shower, double sinks & also a washer & dryer, which was a plus. The kitchen was a good size, for a smaller house. We cooked meals & also used the outdoor bbq. If you’re on the fence about this property, I can assure you…you won’t be disappointed."

I stepped in and felt right at home. the decor was very nicely done. the kitchen came equipped with everything I needed, I just added groceries! there was snacks/coffee/tea getting me with a laminated list of instructions for the stay and check out process, along with a direct line to communication in the event of issues. the bathroom was beautiful and clean, with modern upgrades. They thought of everything down to body wash and makeup towelettes. full washer/dryer. The beds were extremely nice. Each was memory foam, king sized, with fluffy large and multiple pillows. the linens were crisp and clean. digital temp control, house got very cool when we needed it to. the neighbors were quiet & peaceful. everything was within walking distance, but we chose to drive. I highly recommend this host. very accommodating. we're very thankful!

Stayed with kids","This home is in a great location with lots of space to gather friends and family. Checkin and out was simple, and the hosts were helpful when needed. However they were on the property, using the property (which I didn’t realize may be a possibility before it was booked), and interacted with us more than preferred. There was also a wasp and bug problem that prevented us from using the pool as much as we intended, and being bitten by wasps or the black flying bugs when you do use it. The back porch and view is great, although also a wasp problem that will hopefully be addressed. Overall, it was a great place to gather friends and family and we are grateful for the indoor space with ample seating to catch up with family."

The homemade cookies awaiting us were a delightful treat that set the tone for the entire visit. This Airbnb exceeded all our expectations. The amenities provided were outstanding, and we lacked nothing during our stay. They even graciously accommodated some unusual requests. The pool was a refreshing oasis, perfect for cooling off during the hot Texas days & family bonding. The luxurious tub offered a serene and indulgent experience when relaxing at night. Another highlight of the property was undoubtedly the breathtaking scenery & the tranquility it provided. Surrounded by nature, we were able to truly unwind & reconnect with each other when not out exploring. Rick & Heather were exceptional hosts & we truly couldn't have asked for a better place to stay, or better hosts!! We highly recommend selecting this Airbnb for your next stay!!"

They allowed us to have our daughter’s wedding there and I know a lot of hosts stay clear of having large parties but I am grateful she took a chance on us because wonderful memories were made. I hope this shows other hosts that not all people are bad and will destroy your home while having large gatherings. Words can’t express how awesome our experience was but I hope many people will choose to stay in their home because it is beyond what you see in the pictures you have to experience it to truly understand how amazing it is!

But the stand outs are the veranda with multiple seating areas and a large outdoor dining table and the view to the state park. It’s stunning. The pool area is well-stocked. Our family enjoyed hanging out at the pool and shooting darts on the veranda. Beds were comfortable. Lots of seating in the living room. Wonderful place.

The location is great - very close to shopping, but in a quiet neighborhood. We enjoyed shooting baskets in the driveway, walking to the park up the street, and running in San Angelo State Park.
The house is well appointed, with everything we needed to cook, spread out to play games, watch a football game, or stream a movie. The hosts were on-site while we were there. Always accessible and communicative.
This is our third time staying in San Angelo, and the best Air BnB we have stayed at."

Stayed with a pet","House was cleaner than most of the Airbnbs I've stayed at which is very comforting when arriving. There were no insect etc in the home. Had some heating problems but Colin responded within minutes. great job in reinvesting money into your home. too bad it was raining and cold, we would have loved spending time in the very nice back yard."

Stayed with a pet","We loved it as we grew up in San Angelo and it was so much easier than a hotel due to us traveling with our dogs. Being able to sit outside within a fenced, good sized yard was priceless for us. We were able to host family & have room to cool, prepare & hang out. It has a smaller living area but we were able to hang out outside under covered patio and using picnic table. Outdoor lighting was great & gave great ambiance. Having 2 full bathrooms was fabulous. Just so great for our family. For someone who isn’t used to Firestick that was a little challenging but we were able to access local cable.
Overall the trip was successful and all our
family who visited commented on how great & secluded the home was. We spoke to Colin personally and he was very responsive and immediately helpful. We loved being able to bring our 4-legged kids & not worry about noises, barking & going up/down steps."

Stayed with a pet","We stayed at the Rock House for 3 nights while I was in town running a race. The location is great, close to the state park, restaurants, and the Riverwalk. The inside was very spacious and clean, and everything we needed was provided. Overall a quiet area and neighborhood, although I didn't realize initially the house is located right off of a main road, so you do hear a bit of traffic from that, but there is a very secure privacy fence that goes around the entire property, and that was perfect and made the house seem very private! We didn't even really notice outside the yard with the privacy fence, and we really enjoyed the outside area and table and patio, as did our pups and son! Would definitely recommend for a stay in San Angelo!"

Stayed with kids","There are plenty of reasons to stay at The Rock House and not a hotel. The porch, patio and grill are great worthwhile amenities for your stay. There are neighbors and they are neighborly, smile and wave. This is a great spot for Rodeo season, seriously walking distance from the Coliseum. Also, in driving distance is the Chicken Farm Art Center and a park with a playground. There are a few restaurants around the area. We chose to not go to any restaurants since this stay is during a pandemic. A couple of negatives, this is an older house, pretty well renovated, but there were a few bugs. I only saw a couple during the entire stay. Just beware, this town is in the desert(hotter/colder weather), bugs may come around. Just zip up all luggage so no unwanted pests in your belongings. The only big annoyance is the the primary bed room is better to look at then to stay in. The mattress is uncomfortable. Just placing a hand on the mattress is all the indication necessary. Didn't stay in the room, but it has the better bathroom to shower in. But all and all this house is a reasonable place to stay."

It’s not easy traveling with 2 exploring toddlers under the age of 3 but the set up of the home and yard made it a lot easier for us. Inside the home it was easy to lock the bedrooms to keep them in the main area. We took a couple of our door handle safety covers to keep them out of the restroom and laundry room and vuala! A lot easier to keep and eye on them . We also took a cabinet lock which help to keep them out from under the kitchen sink .The yard is completely enclosed with enough space for them to roam around. Over all we enjoyed our stay, if we ever return to San Angelo we will definitely consider staying there again !"

I didn’t do this - I looked at the rules instead and now we are stuck paying a huge $110 fee to the host.

Stayed with kids","This is a very hard place to rate because there are some big pros, but also some serious cons.
The house is beautifully updated and almost like staying in a hotel. The photos are very accurate. Having access to a full kitchen and a washer and dryer is very helpful, especially while traveling during the pandemic. The outdoor space is also very nice and securely fenced so you can let your dog out without worrying. Once you’re through the gate, everything about this house is very aesthetically pleasing.
The big problem with this place is the location. It is not in a residential area. It is right on a very busy street in a weird, almost industrial kind of area on the outskirts of town. There is not even a place to go for a walk. There is a constant traffic noise so even though you can’t see the ugliness from the yard, you can definitely hear it. I was glad to have my big dogs with me since I might not have felt super safe otherwise. It is a relatively quick drive to the state park, but that’s the only advantage of the location.
If you’re just looking for a nice place to lay your head, this house will give you everything you need in a very pretty package. If you are the kind of person who likes to take an evening walk or who wants easy access to things like restaurants or coffee shops, look elsewhere."

Stayed with kids",You can tell this home is well loved and cared for. The place was just the right size for my family. I loved the fence around the property. It was great to let my kids run around outside to let off some energy. Colin was quick to respond to anything we needed and provided clear communication on check-in and check-out procedures. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The home is located in an area that gives some privacy but still is close to town. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!

Stayed a few nights","Spent a few days in San Angelo to just get away. We arrived about an hour and a half before check-in and were so glad that Chrys accommodated us. The place is very clean and roomy. Our little dog loved the doggie door and fenced in yard. The kitchen was well stocked with everything we needed. Only problem we had was with the WiFi going out quite a bit and window units kept things cool but were a bit noisy.
I would highly recommend this place!"

Stayed a few nights","I was a little concerned about the location and lack of central A/C, but both of those concerns proved to be unnecessary. The window units kept the whole house nice and cool - even in July. The location is pretty far north in an area that I was a little concerned about prior to arriving, but we felt very safe there. There’s little to no traffic in San Angelo so we were 15 minutes or less from every where we went. The house is on a main road and has lots of lighting. There’s a fire station about a block away, but we never heard any sirens. The house was very quiet and great for rest. The fence was wonderful for privacy and for our dog. The yard was very spacious and nicely xeriscaped. The beds were all comfortable and the kitchen is quite roomy. Chrys was very quick to respond to my questions. We will definitely stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","Chrys,
Thank you for a pleasant stay while in San Angelo. We were in town for several family events - Family Reunion, baby shower and a wedding reception. Your home was perfect. The location on the North Side of town was great with easy access to major roads, Chadbourne and Grape Creek Road. If someone were attending the San Angelo Stock Show & Rodeo, your home would be a perfect location!
Bedrooms are decent sized with comfy beds and the whole house was very clean! Oh and plenty of hangers in each of the closets, too!
Parking was more than adequate (at one point we had 4 SUVs parked on the drive way parking area and another in the circle drive).
The over the top touch was that Chrys provided a unique basket of travel accessories that most times are forgotten until needed! I loved that!
The next time we are in San Angelo we will be staying here! Thank you for helping to make our vacation so wonderful!
Best

Stayed a few nights","This was our first airbnb experience and it was amazing. The house was beautiful. Checking in was as simple as pressing a code on the door. My husband and I came with both our dogs and this place was so dog friendly. Metal gate around front and back, tile floors, close to pet friendly activities. We went hiking at the state park we were also going to check out the Lilly garden, but our dog got sick. Chrys was also extremely understanding when our dog got sick and the vet said she shouldn’t travel. We asked if we could stay an extra night and she responded quickly that she was sorry our dog was sick and that we could stay. It was comforting to know that, while we were worried about our dog, we didn’t have to worry where we were going to stay that night. It was an awesome experience."
