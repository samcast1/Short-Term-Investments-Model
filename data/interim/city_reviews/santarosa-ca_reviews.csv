Stayed a few nights",Lisa was a wonderful host. Very friendly & helpful. The room is furnished perfectly. She has clearly thought through what you need to make simple meals. The bed was super comfy. The view out the window is full of green. The bathroom is really nice. I’ll stay there again.

Stayed a few nights","In a lushly flowering garden is the small terrace that belongs to the room. Wonderfully quiet location, everything is easily accessible. The room itself is spacious and nicely designed, all well thought out. Lisa takes care of it and is always available. Gives great tips. Santa Rosa is the ideal base for us to explore the Wine Country."

Stayed one night","Just an adorable little suite in a quiet residential neighborhood but very close to lots of things. The bathroom was just wonderful with a deep soaking tub, the grounds were charming if you want to sit in the garden in front of your window, and really the only tiny complain is the bed was a little squeaky when you sit on the edge. But that was such a small thing among absolutely lovely other things. Did I mention how fluffy and soft the towels are? I might need to buy some ASAP!"

The room has a direct view of the porch and you can spot some of the cats outside which was fun. Everything was super clean and the location is close to a lot of eateries. I would recommend staying here if you find yourself in Santa Rosa."

Stayed a few nights","This place perfectly met my needs. It was in a quiet neighborhood, yet close to where I needed to go. For explorations farther afield, it has easy access to Hwy 101. The main room had plenty of space for the bed and a sitting area. It was part of the main house, but it was private with my own entrance. I loved being able to park in the driveway. There is no kitchen but it had everything except a stovetop and a sink, and was well stocked. The shower is in a deep soaking tub - wish I had time for a soak! Lisa was very friendly and helpful. I loved her beautiful garden to look out on and that she had cats, but I only met the one that frequents the porch. I hope I have a reason to return!"

Quiet, private, relaxing, comfortable, great parking and all the important amenities like silverware, place to hang clothes, temperature controlled environment and super nice bathroom. The tub was amazing and the addition of epson salts and toiletries were so great. The bed was incredibly comfortable. There were some fig bars which were so nice for a quick snack when we got in before we ordered some food to be delivered. This is one of the best neighborhoods in Santa Rosa! Such cute homes. Lisa was very kind and responsive. Will definitely be coming back next time I need a spot in Santa Rosa!"

Stayed one night","Lisa’s listing was exactly as described! It was easy to find, easy to check in, and she was very responsive.
It was an amazing stay even though I was only there a short amount of time.
Everything was clean! Plenty of shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and body lotion to use. All really good and clean brands as well. My husband was even able to take a bath with some epsom salt! He was excited about that.
The bed was super comfy and just what we needed for a good night sleep before finishing our drive home.
The neighborhood was safe, welcoming, and being able to park in the driveway was a huge plus for us.
She also left us some fig bars, water, nuts, and candy for our drive back home.
I will be staying here again the next time we are passing through Santa Rosa! Thanks Lisa!! :)"

Stayed with kids","Wow, Lisa's place was so adorable! We felt right at home. We had everything we needed for our stay. She had everything stocked we could have possibly needed. Definitely a far better deal than a hotel, and just what we needed for a comfortable sleep during our family reunion in Santa Rosa. What stood out most for us was the awesome bed! I was tempted to bring my own pillows and blankets, but it wasn't even necessary! I was delighted to get such a great sleep on The tempur-pedic mattress, the sheets, the pillows, the comforter were all perfect! And with all the crazy temperature changes going on, I was so happy to have perfect temperature control while we slept. She had a smart TV which made us feel at home. The view out the window is so cute, the comfy velvet swivel chairs were a nice touch, and she even offered us ripe juicy peaches from her tree! A very welcoming host. Thank you, Lisa!"

Unfortunately, we were a bit noisy because the lower floor was labeled ""laundry"", and we didn't know we had a neighbor, so beware: because it's extremely clairaudient (we just played cards). We were greeted with a bottle of red wine and the beds were very comfortable. Would recommend this accommodation to anyone. Thanks Vinay, and sorry again about the noise :-)"

It was a true pleasure to become acquainted with him. The lodging is easy to find, with easy parking. Our upstairs accommodation was super clean, well-equipped, very private and quiet. Extremely comfortable beds. And just 3 minutes away from our favorite Indian restaurant, YETI. That alone is a Big Plus! There was a complementary bottle of wine waiting for us which, alas, we did not have the opportunity to enjoy; but we loved the gesture. Altogether a lovely situation. It's probably the most convenient and comfortable Airbnb we've ever stayed at, and is now a definite destination for us."

Stayed a few nights","We stayed here with our baby to visit Napa and Sonoma valley. Santa Rosa and Vinays place are a great location for any winery tours. The property feels secure and having a dedicated parking spot, washing (didn't used it, though), an own entry with numpad, a full kitchen, two bedrooms and a very nice shower is really helpful for unwinding. The living room is a bit dim lit. The whole experience was contactless and Vinay was nice helping out with extra linen and earlier check-in. What should be noted is that if you sleep with open windows the noise from the street comes in, although the property is secluded. We needed to manage that for our baby, but generally we don't mind - I just wanted to give a hint for other adventurous parents ;-)"

And the reviews that tout Vinay’s responsiveness? Absolutely spot on. We had a problem (absolutely nothing that Vinay was responsible for) and I messaged him late one night to let him know that an emergency vehicle would be showing up. He and his daughter beat the emergency response folks to help us out. All in all, wonderful place and super responsive and nice owner."

They have a beautiful pool with a slide and a nice lounge area next to it. I rented the 2 bedroom upstairs unit. It was extremely clean and modern. It had a large comfortable couch with a smart tv. There is everything you would ever need stocked in the kitchen. Wonderful walk in shower. Beds were extremely comfortable and one room has a tv.

Very comfortable beds and pillows. We liked the layout of the unit. It's close to a main road which could be a little noisy for me (but I'm used to more quiet). Road was very quiet at night though, and we all slept great. Nice shower, plenty of towels. Nice cooking appliances and new pots and pans.

On the condiments side, it was unusual not to find sugar or olive oil. The kitchen was minimally equipped in terms of utensils.
Foosball located in the garage/playroom was old and hard to play.
There were 4-5 small dated candies for a compliment offering.
Nothing stood out as an Airbnb facility. What surprised me was
the cleaning fee of $250 for 2 night stays. What’s more I found it audacious to leave an envelope of suggesting a tip for the housekeeping."

Easy to get to the freeway, Starbucks and other restaurants were close by, and the house itself was very comfortable. We weren’t interested in the pool table when we booked but ended up using it everytime we were at home. Would definitely stay again"

The house is very clean/tidy and equally inviting and we were comfortable the moment we set food inside.
The home is close to gather necessities or Starbucks and has a great park/community vibe. We enjoyed playing foosball in the garage rec room.
The bed is comfortable and great shower in the master. The home is well equipped in the kitchen to cook a meal.
I did appreciate that they don’t have a lot of scented candles/air fresheners around which for someone who is sensitive to those like myself it made the stay all the more pleasant.
Amazing stay and hope to come stay there again!"

Stayed with kids","If you are looking for a place to stay and start your wine adventures, this home is PRIME!! It's a home away from home, everything and more. In my opinion, I'd stay here over any hotel or motel especially when you want a place to spend time and share a space with family and friends. It's near so many places. Wineries are about 30-45 mins away depending on which wineries or breweries you plan to go to. Near great restaurants/ eateries and stores. Also, if you're a Peanuts fan it's close to the Charles M. Schulz Museum. This home is so clean, super nice, with a backyard that comes with a grill and games. Spacious for a family of 6 PLUS ,it is dog -friendly with Coffey Park just 2-3 min walk away. Our Australian Shepherd gives it all Four paws up! Angie and Julian made the entire process simple, easy, and they made sure that if you needed anything or had questions/concerns they respond in quick responses as well. I am definitely recommending this home to friends and family not to mention staying here again on our next trip out to Santa Rosa or Napa/Sonoma County. If this home is available for you to book, you should take it <3"

Lots of little extras that made our stay special. We were in town for a wedding in Santa Rosa and to do some close by exploring. Found a map for a Cheese Trail and some places that were nearby. Came home with lots of yummy cheese. A great alternative to wine tasting. We would give this great place a 5+ rating.

I came for a visit with my 4 year old granddaughter and sprained my foot recently so could not do a lot of outings like we would usually do . But we had a great time staying in and watching movies, baking and playing games. The space was very cozy, the kitchen well appointed and the bed was so comfortable. We enjoyed treats and homemade salsa as well! The location was great, in a nice neighborhood and easy to get around to where we needed to go. We also enjoyed the park on the next block and hope to come back again and enjoy all of the beautiful walking trails. Rhonda and Jeanine were responsive to any questions I had and Rhonda even helped me unload the car when I got there! I recommend Rhonda and Jeanine’s very highly!"

The highway is close by - it's easy to hop on and make one's way over to the many wineries in the surrounding area. I did have a vehicle and parking was available right in front.

I love that there is a full kitchen, especially for travelling with kiddos. It feels so private that you forget that you are technically attached to their main house, but they are also right there if you need them.
Its technically in Santa Rosa, but near the Sebastopol side, so its easy to avoid the bigger city hubbub while still having to quick access to essentials you may have forgotten (life with kids, amiright?).
Just book it. You won't regret it (:"

The bathroom had a supply of razors, toothbrushes, etc in case you forgot. However for me, it was the kitchen that stood out. It was truly functional, with spices, and condiments. Nice pots, pans and small appliances. You could stop at the market for veggies, chicken, and breakfast stuff and actually cook a meal. Perfect for people who are working - like me- and not interested in restaurants for every meal. On top of that they provide sweet goodies like chocolate mint patties and granola bars. Yum. 😊👍"

Little signs up around the place made it easy to know how to control everything. It was hot during the days we stayed, but Rhonda was so kind to offer opening our windows in the cool evening since we were coming home late. It was the perfect sleeping temperature when we arrived later that night! We loved the lighted path to the door, the keypad that light up for us to enter and even electric candles inside on timers! Our only regret is not having more time to just relax and enjoy the home! Because our visit was primarily to see the grandkids, we were out most of the time. But this will definitely be our place of choice to stay next time we are in town. Thank you Rhonda and Jeanine for thinking of all the little details…right down to razors and dental floss!"

Stayed a few nights","Stay was ok. Felt as if we were immediately supposed to walk on eggshells as I was instantly told after booking by host that some prior guests were not “great.” and she seemed worried which was off putting and honestly made me want to cancel… I’m sorry other guests were not great but that doesn’t mean new guests will be bad… then, odd, Right before checkin I got a seemingly urgent text that there might be a leak in the place and they needed entry… we hadn’t even checked in yet, wondered if maybe an excuse to snoop and make sure we were “good”… they also did not message through the app which was even more strange… Most likely will not be back just due to just the uninviting feeling. Just honest experience. I’m sure they are very very nice- maybe just need to stick to the 2 guest rule if it created unnecessary stress and ends up on new guests. Thanks for accommodating us."

Stayed one night","If possible Rhonda and Jeanine's place was better than the listing. Extremely comfortable couch and bed, pristine kitchen and bathroom, and some nice things like snacks make this the best AirBnB we've ever stayed at (my wife can confirm that claim). It's located in a very quiet neighborhood but close enough to downtown Santa Rosa (10 or so minutes) that it's not a chore to get there. Their place honestly felt like a home away from home. If we're ever in Santa Rosa again and their place is available I will not hesitate to book. Highest recommendation!"

The space was thoughtfully decorated and even had special touches like cute Christmas decorations, flickering ""candles"" (battery powered) that were already on, personalized welcome sign and card, and a gift of a jar of homemade salsa. They stocked it with everything we might need - coffee, snacks, toiletries. You can tell they take a lot of pride in fixing up and providing this lovely space. And of course the koi pond in the back is the coolest. We were in Santa Rosa window shopping for places to live but we might just move in here if they'd let us! Would definitely stay here again. Thank you!"

Stayed one night","I'm on a cross country trip and this was my 7th AirBNB. When you're jumping from one AirBNB to the next from night to night, it is impossible to not compare.
I loved Rhonda and Jeanine's overnight space. Incredibly cozy!!! I've come to learn that cozy can be an insult with AirBNBs...I mean it in a good way!!! Sooooo comfortable and their attention to detail was really appreciated. For instance, they have a USB multi port on the bedside table, that seemed above and beyond to me. They also put effort into their space...thoughtful paint colors on the walls, colorful & contrasting soft/absorbent towels, not just white. Printed sheets, not just white. An actual bedspread, not a duvet wrapped in white sheets the way most hotels and some AirBNBs dress their beds. As silly as it sounds, I really wish I could travel WITH their AirBNB so that I'm guaranteed a restful evening in all of my upcoming locations. :) ...for whatever it is worth, I'm an interior designer and I appreciated their efforts from more than an overnight guest's standpoint."

Aside from the pure charm of the place, it was pristine, cozy, and comfortable. We have stayed at some really nice places, but Rhonda & Jeanine’s place exceeded all expectations. From clear directions, to welcoming personal touches, it was not “just a place to stay”, it was an experience all on its own. If Airbnb ever wanted to model how a stay should go, they should consult Rhonda and Jeanine. We can’t recommend them strong enough. Thanks for all the extras we felt very spoiled."

The only surprises were the nice treats left for us! I would stay there again and recommend to others."

Check in was incredibly easy and there is an outside patio area to sit and enjoy some drinks. The location is great and Christina recommended a range of wineries for us to visit. There are lots of great restaurants to visit and the property is about a 10 - 15 minute drive to the nearest winery which we loved.

Stayed a few nights","We can’t say enough about how awesome our experience was at Julia and Patrick’s AirBnB. The communication upon reserving the room, leading up to the weekend, during the stay and after leaving was perfect. One of the nicest things was the message a day out with very easy to understand entry details to the location. Once we arrived, the space was exactly as described and we want to point out that every single detail was accounted for; the setup of the kitchen with coffee mugs/to-go cups(&sleeves!!), plates, silverware, refrigerator(with water), Nespresso coffee maker (which was fantastic with our almond milk) and the nice counter space. The bathroom was nicely arranged and could fit two people getting ready at the same time pretty well! The shower could also accommodate for two long hot showers , which was so nice. The bed was a nice, firm foam top mattress and they had multiple pillows to meet your sleeping needs. Overall it was fantastic and we’ll stay again on our next trip!!"

The neighborhood is great for walks and is a jaunt away from Howarth park and its serene lake views.

Stayed a few nights","So I really liked this space. It is above an attached garage but it is significantly better than that sounds. It was extremely clean, had a comfortable bed, and the sheets/pillows were very comfortable as well. There is a Nespresso machine there, 2 choices of delicious coffee were offered, there was plain creamer available (my favorite), and there were to-go cups for use. There was a clean, modern, microwave, small fridge, and sturdy paper plates/plastic ware for use. There was also a small table for 2 to eat at. The shower had hot water that didn't run out and good pressure. I did not hear anything or anyone from the main house during my stay. The host was quick to make sure I could check-in easily. The garage which it was above was empty and I believe there was an offer to be able to store bikes, kayaks, etc. in there during your stay. Parking in the driveway was fine, the host parked on the street. There is a small patio to sit at outside which was private. Full disclosure it is up a moderately steep flight of maybe 10-12 stairs so if you can't do stairs it is not for you. It's in a quiet neighborhood, with nice houses, where I felt safe walking at night. It is about a 5-8 minute walk to Howarth Park which is the entrance to some nice looking hiking trails and lakes you could spend hours upon hours walking about."

I road tripped to Napa to purchase all of my wines & she even allowed me to store ALL of my cases in her garage. I couldn't have been more grateful of her & Patrick's hospitality. The space is private, quiet & incredibly clean. The bed was comfortable & at times I almost missed getting up for my tastings. When I have more focus on Santa Rosa wineries, I would definitely stay here again. It is about 40-50 minutes from Napa so plan your commute accordingly. Lovely home & hosts!"

It was conveniently located just a morning walk down from Avid coffee, which became our favorite for their delicious breakfast sandwiches. Their place is centrally located between all of Sonoma--just a quick easy drive to local hiking spots, Petaluma, Sebastopol (which is one of our favorites!) & Calistoga--which was the reason for our stay, a friend's wedding. We were close to awesome dining spots & amaizng wine tasting! Their place was very clean, cute & comfy! :]"

I was afraid that the room would be too dark but the side lamps next to the bed really helped. The bed was so comfortable, I was able to fall asleep after a long day of work. The neighborhood is also very quiet at night and a plus for having loads of parking on the streets. I will def stay at Julia’s place again."

The guest suite was super clean, comfortable, quiet, and has everything one needs for a short or long term stay. Looks like the unit was recently renovated with a modern style, in-unit HVAC/controls kept us at ideal temperatures, and I loved the little workstation and lounge areas! Neighborhood is very peaceful, walking & cycling friendly, and has awesome sushi, coffee, a Whole Foods, and a park with walking trials, hiking trails, and a huge playground within walking distance.

Stayed a few nights","A nice, quiet place to stay while exploring the area: The room is small but comfortable, very clean, pleasantly decorated and extremely well-equipped. The hosts have clearly put a lot of thought into providing what guests might need – including good reading lights AND charging stations on both sides of the bed; a toaster and kettle as well as a Keurig machine; folding chairs and TV trays; even wall hooks for jackets and towels. Bonus points for a good shower with strong flow and hot water right away. We had no trouble finding a parking spot on the street immediately in front of the house. There are many good restaurants in Santa Rosa, Sebastopol and other towns up the road; or if you just want takeout, try Canevari's Deli a block away on Lewis Road for an old-school meatball sub and delicious cannoli."

Liza and Jennifer have thought of literally everything. The space is perfectly appointed - almost Scandinavian style, everything you could need (and more!) is tucked away somewhere. Well thought out space. Original art; sweet details like one softer pillow, one harder, for each guest; well-laid out bathroom; great little kitchenette-type area. I actually searched for listings with a kettle because we always bring a press and our own coffee when going out; Liza’s place had that.
Very private, quiet, and an outdoor space which in the winter gets sun by about 10 am, if you want to enjoy the patio. I’ll definitely be back when it’s time to tour a few more wineries."

Stayed a few nights","This is a cute, small studio with a bathroom nestled behind what seems like a duplex. It is very clean and nicely decorated. The only bother to me was multiple requests asking for the reason for my visit, which I don't think is something that should be required to be shared. For example, a person may be in town due to a family death and not want to discuss that. Additionally, there are clear rules when booking that there are quiet hours that must be agreed to upon booking. Then another email is sent about quiet hours. Then it is stated again when you check in. I was also asked who was staying with me, even though I explain that it was only me and why I was visiting in the booking request. These multiple messages were excessive to me compared to my many other Airbnb stays. I understand that people must be quiet and accurate about who is staying with them. If people break those rules, just kick them out."

Stayed a few nights","One of the reasons that this was such a nice experience was that everything lived up to what we had seen in the photos and read in the description and reviews. As one other reviewer said, they really thought through and provided for every need, short of a full kitchen. It is a prefect little quiet hideaway for one person, and for short periods of time, for two people as well. Having dual night tables with power/USB plugs on both sides as well as clothes hooks on both sides were some of the little touches that made the stay so enjoyable."

There was enough room, a comfortable bed, and clean bathroom with all basic amenities. Definitely not walk-able from the downtown area, but only a 10 mins bicycle ride. No kitchen or cooking equipment, so if you wish to cook, probably best to find another place. The outdoor yard area was wonderful to hang out in, or enjoy that morning coffee!"

The 2nd day I was there the water heater broke down and the host was very responsive and quick in having it replaced so I didn't end up missing a shower. The bed was comfortable.

The check in box is amazing, you never have to worry about locking yourself out or loosing the key."

The communication with the host was exceptional and all the instructions (check-in, etc) very thorough!"

The instructions and communication from Janette and Stan was very helpful and made finding the place and checking in a breeze. The place is very well thought out and will have everything you may need for a comfortable and relaxing stay. Which is what I needed at that time. They include a microwave, toaster oven, small frig, coffee maker, and utensils. You also have a walk in closet to hang your clothes as well as a dresser. The suite is large and can comfortably sleep 5 people. The pool table was fun to use at the end of the day. The bed and pillows were comfortable, not too hard. The neighborhood is really nice and quite with an inviting park across the street. The Wi-Fi worked great and they have helpful notes around the suite. Janette and Stan are wonderful people and have put a lot of thought and care into making their suite feel like home."

Stayed a few nights","This is an excellent place to stay. It is above a 2 car garage but feels like a genuine and spacious studio apartment. Also, while attached to the main house I never heard anyone or any real noise and they have a dog that barked maybe all of once. I really loved the comfortable, curved, couch-recliner and TV set up. It was easy to get the temp I wanted (I used the A/C). The bed was really comfortable and big. There were 2 other beds there but I only used the one. The natural lighting was nice (I would recommend a sleep mask if you want an afternoon nap). I think the pool table was a 3/4 size one and that was fun. I want to say that the house is down of 50 yard treed driveway so you may not see it first so just look for the mailbox number. The hosts were nice people and easy to get in touch with. Definitely one of my favorite Santa Rosa places to stay. It is p on a hill so the morning view was pretty nice indeed."

Everything is super straightforward from all the instructions to operate things and checkout process as well.
They really care about their guests and it shows in their space to welcome us with an introduction to Sonoma wine. Pool table was a great center console for us to detach from our digital age:) Beds were comfy and bathroom was clean with extra towels for us to use. Location is convenient to breweries, wineries and grocery store as well. Definitely would stay with them again when we're in the area!

The Private Loft gives you a sense of being on your own apartment. Stan and Janette were so nice to have everything explained and set from our arrival to our departure. Even left some sweets by our door for us to enjoy. Loved sitting by the fireplace with the nice chilly weather we had throughout our stay. The guys enjoyed playing on the Pool table while us the girls zipped wine and planned our days in Sonoma and Napa.
I could not have asked for a better birthday weekend and stay.
Looking forward to visit again.
Thank you for your hospitality. 💙

The fireplace is a wonderful touch, as winter nears. The suite is carpeted, and though there was no mention of removing our shoes, there is a basket at the bottom of the stairs for them. We had no problem with this, as we didn't feel comfortable walking around with our shoes on since it was raining. There's even a pool table to boot! We really lucked out booking this suite, and will definitely be back!"

The large studio like setting is right above the garage and separate from the rest of the house. It was clean and cozy and more than sufficient enough space for my wife and I. There are a couple of extra beds as well so not a bad option for a larger family either. Janette was super responsive to our questions - not that we had that many in the first place as everything was easy to figure out. The location can't be beat. Russian River, downtown and Calistoga are all within a 10-15 minute drive. The pool table and a welcoming bottle of wine was nice touch."

Great home with all you need for your stay and plenty of space to comfortably spend indoors with the pool table and hang out with family/friends.

Stayed a few nights",My girlfriend and I stayed here for a weekend and had a lot of fun enjoying santa rosa food and wine. The air conditioning was wonderful and the pool table was a lot of fun. It was spacious enough and comfortable enough for us to feel at home immediately. I will be looking to see if this spot is available for future trips. Thank you Janette and Stan for a wonderful weekend.

Stayed a few nights","My partner and I were visiting Santa Rosa for a few days to escape the smoke in the Bay, and we were totally blown away by Janette's hospitality. The space is huge, extremely comfortable for two, easily able to accommodate more. We rested up, worked remotely, and enjoyed time in the park and in downtown Santa Rosa. Would highly recommend to anyone passing through the area :)"

Stayed a few nights","Janette and Stan's place is wonderful for a getaway to the wine country! We were thrilled to find such a clean, immaculate space. Checkin was a breeze, they wrote a personalized welcome sign for us, there is easy parking, an awesome pool table, and lots of local suggestions. We werent able to use the 50% off wine tastings they left for us, but we will the next time around! They left us a bottle of wine and some craft beers in the fridge, as well as coffees and teas. Honestly, a perfect set up for a relaxing getaway. The house is quiet and cozy and the king bed was so comfortable. I haven't slept so well in months! Thank you Janette and Stan for such quick communication and for being so hospitable. We would love to stay again in the future."

Stayed a few nights","This is a great place to stay if you're in the area! Janette and Steve are awesome hosts and they made me feel very welcome upon my arrival. When I entered the driveway they had a welcome sign with my name on it and upon entering their Airbnb I was greeted by a bottle of wine and some delicious local pastries.
The place is awesome! It's very spacious, yet feels really cozy. It's also separated by a hall from the main house which gives you a nice sense of privacy. They keep it very clean and well sanitized.
They have neatly laid out recommendations for tons of things to do around the area and places to wine-taste and eat.
This place has pretty much all the amenities you would need and have at your own home.
Their place is also in a great location. Right across the road there's a nice park you can go for a walk or a jog. And lots of food options within a 2-5 minute radius.
They are very friendly and responsive if you need to get a hold of them and everything in the Airbnb is well organized with clear labels and instructions on how to use and where to find everything.
When I'm back in the area, this is where I am hoping to stay again. Thanks again to Janette and Steve for hosting me."

We loved how bright and spacious the place was, and there was plenty of room for our little one as well as space for us to lounge and rest. We were impressed by all of the small touches that Janette and Stan did to make us feel welcome and relaxed. We look forward to returning!"

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I decided to get away for the weekend and we are so glad we found Janette & Stan’s place! The evening before we were supposed to head there, my husband got called into work that Saturday. I quickly messaged Janette and informed her of the situation. I asked if it would be possible to come up Saturday evening and stay until Monday instead the original Friday through Sunday. She got back to me within a few hours and let me know that everything was taken care of and that it would be just fine. This was so reassuring after stressing out that our weekend may have to be cancelled. When my husband and I arrived Saturday evening, we were greeted with a chalkboard sign personally welcoming us and directing us where to park. Janette had text me earlier with check-In instructions and they couldn’t be more clear. We found the private entrance to our studio and were pleasantly surprised by how spacious, clean, and homey it was! The pictures don’t do it justice! They have everything you could think of needing when away from home. The pool table was a bonus! My husband and I haven’t played in ages, and so it was a blast having that option. They had clear instructions for the use of everything - TV, Internet, Fans, Air Conditioning, etc. The location was perfect! Only 30-40 min from Bodega Bay, which we took full advantage of. They also offered a list of recommended restaurants, which we chose a few to try. Great recommendations! We are looking forward to coming back with the kids next time - as there were more beds to fill in the room! So spacious!"

There is a set of curtains for each bed to act as dividers for a little bit of privacy. While a smaller space, it is very well laid out and stocked with plenty of extra amenities. The place was very clean and the owners are super nice!"

Stayed a few nights","This is one of the absolute best finds on Airbnb. The hosts, Janette & Stan, were in communication with me the entire time. I heard back immediately on the booking. We had the important door code the day before, with other rentals I have experienced a communication problem.
The place was spotless and welcoming. Wine and Wine Glasses. Dishes to use, microwave and a good size mini fridge. Keurig coffee pot and also a good selection of tea. The fireplace was beautiful and warm. The couch is perfect size for a family. The pool table was really fun. The beds are very comfy and set far enough apart to give you your own space. They even set up a pack n play with a stuffed animal as we were bringing a little one with us.
The unit looks just like it does on the website. You will not be disappointed if you book this beautiful ""loft"" above the garage. Felt very warm and nicely decorated. Many thanks to the Hosts."
