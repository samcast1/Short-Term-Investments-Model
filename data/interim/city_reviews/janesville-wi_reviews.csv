Stayed one night","A great place to stay on my way to Minneapolis St. Paul. The house was really clean and adorable. Maura even had some fun little K cups available for her guests to use in her Keurig, which I really appreciated because I forgot to get some at the store on my way up. The house was decorated with a find Bohemian style. You could tell that Maura put a lot of effort into the details of her living room and kitchen; the communal areas of this home There were some great restaurants near nearby on the main street in downtown Janesville. I had a wonderful salmon salad at the Whiskey Bar and Grill. Also, the neighborhood had an old-fashioned little Americana feel and I felt extremely safe. In fact, I’m staying there again on my way back home tomorrow evening. Thank you so much for your hospitality Maura!"

Stayed about a week","The house was very comfortable and a homey place to stay for a week. It is well-set up for people traveling alone or with one other person. The kitchen was well-equipped and I appreciated being able to cook breakfast. The only missing item was a cutting board, which is not essential. The living room was cosy, a bit small if we had been a group of four, however great for one person working on a laptop. I really appreciated being able to park in the driveway for peace of mind about the rental car! It was great to know that Maura and her husband were available and responsive throughout my stay. Overall, they have provided a comfortable and very functional place to stay durya visit to Janesville."

Stayed with a pet","Inexpensive space with a large backyard for the dogs. There is only one bathroom for four rooms, so that could mean up to 8 adults sharing one bathroom. The shared kitchen was sufficient for minimal meals and food storage in the refrigerator/freezer. Maura was very communicative."

The people staying there, on the other had were very stand offish and it was like having the house to myself. I am used to a more socially friendly place (not Maura's fault)"

Stayed with a pet","This place was nice; comfy after a snow storm around Janesville. The place was warm, the paths shoveled and a place for leaving shoes. My 2 pugs enjoyed the area even though the snow was too high for them 😃. But they were able to find spots to go. 💩 And having a poop bags available was very nice as I had forgot mine. Having a kitchen available was very nice. I will stay again when in the area."

Group trip","Lovely 1880's farm house has been updated cosmetically and provides comfort and space for a large group. Good communication, check in was easy and flexible due to no booking immediately before or after, ample parking, well stocked kitchen including a nice welcome basket, awesome large dining table with coffee bar area, comfortable beds in bedrooms with ceiling fans.
Biggest negatives: No bathroom on the second floor where 4 of the 5 bedrooms are. Downsides: The towels in the bathrooms are somewhat small (although an abundance of wash cloths were provided) No side tables for some of the beds, no table lamps, and limited outlets for plugging in. The road the house sits on is actually fairly busy and surprisingly noisy even late at night.
One complaint: removing my own bedding and taking out trash when I'm being charged a hefty cleaning fee. (Other places do not require this)
But, it's a beautiful home, in a lovely setting, great for large groups convenient to several towns in the area"

1. Extremely clean and updated
2. Lot of amenities: Firepit, cornhole, etc
3. Communicative and kind hosts. Internet wasnt working. and within a few minutes of telling them, they came and fixed it. Also great suggestions on things to do prior to our arrival
The only con would be only 2 bathrooms, but this is something that is stated very clearly from the beginning and so can plan for the two bathrooms."

Stayed with kids","This house was amazing for our crew! We were a large group coming from all over to relax and vacation together. The kids had plenty of space for playing and many games of sardines were had. The fire pit was well stocked & the walking field was well maintained so we could stretch our legs. It was the first time we didn’t have to eat in shifts when all together, as we all fit around the dining room table. We were comfortable in our rooms & the insulation was so great that the littles could go to bed early and the big kids could stay up later and play without worry of waking them up. The house itself is beautifully renovated, with amazing old details sprinkled around (ie: the doorknobs!). It was so clean and comfortable! We want to make this a yearly get away!"

We made s’mores by the campfire, took walks and watch the fire flies over the field. In the evenings… it was truly magical."

Stayed with kids","I love being in the country so that made it wonderful! The place was super clean, calm, quiet, and very lovely. My son just died and my other children are scattered all around the country, so this was the perfect meeting place. It was nice having my family all be able to stay in this beautiful home without being crowded. The house has so much room, and the huge table in the dining room was just the best. Lots of talking happening around the big table was comforting for everyone. The kitchen was also well stocked and we could cook rather than go to restaurants. From check in till checkout everything went perfectly. This is not a house, it is a home filled with love. We were able to create some new memories to cherish. I’m hoping to be able to come back in a couple of years and have a nice family reunion. I think any family would love this place, and should try it! Highly recommend for peace and quiet when you don’t want the hassles of running from room to room at some random hotel!"

I highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a comfortable, tranquil, and enjoyable stay, especially for large groups looking to catch up and reunite."

Group trip","The site is as pictured and described; it was very comfortable for our family reunion. We were 7 adults sharing the house, and it worked very well for us. The bedrooms were large and comfortable, the kitchen was more than adequate for preparing full meals, and the house was tastefully decorated for the holidays. Great dining room with farmhouse table and benches, and nice coffee bar.
The farm is about 15-20 minutes from Janesville, on good roads. Easy to locate, but load up w/ supplies needed before you come."

Stayed a few nights","LOVED!! An absolutely perfect stay and the photos don’t do the apartment justice. Super nice and responsive hosts, Jim greeted me in person with a delicious pumpkin roll in hand that paired wonderfully with hazelnut coffee - what a warm welcome! There are two beds with excellent separation for two individuals traveling together, the bed was super comfortable, as was the furniture in the living room. There’s a cozy fireplace that I didn’t use, but everything is so inviting that I didn’t want to leave. I really appreciated the ceiling fans as well as portable tower fans that will oscillate. The lights on dimmers were much appreciated, too! So many thoughtful touches. This has been my hand-down favorite stay. I was in town to meet with an attorney and found this location to be super convenient to the downtown and courthouse area, easily walkable and friendly neighborhood that felt exceptionally safe. It was nice to be able to use the driveway, especially for unloading and loading luggage."

We actually booked our next stay before I even got around to writing this review for our previous stay, so we'll be back soon! The apartment is very comfortable, well stocked, and a home away from home. I ended up having a terrible migraine the night we arrived. I appreciated so much the comfortable couch where I could just rest and watch t.v. The apartment is walking distance to the Lions Food Mart, as well as a Mexican grocery store/restaurant. The grocery store/restaurant has basics and we were able to get eggs, cheese for quesadillas, and a lemon for some homemade guacomole. I always cook when we are there and the apartment is well stocked with a blender, crockpot, cooking utensils, etc."

Stayed with kids","This was my first Airbnb experience, and the bar has been set very high.
They thought of pretty much everything. I arrived later than intended and not only did Jim take my phone call to help me find the location, he stayed on the phone to be sure my code worked on the door and I could enter.
The water bottles in the fridge and snacks available were a wonderful addition (especially after a long day of flights). They had an entire folder of local restaurants and things to do in addition to puzzles and some games in the house. Instructions were clear for everything and we had a wonderful stay.
When we come back to visit family again we will definitely plan on staying here. We had a great time and it was everything we could need and more."

Stayed with kids","Overall, we had a good experience at Jim’s place! It was nice being able to get just about anywhere in town in ~10 minutes. We had trouble with the code to get in initially, but the issue was resolved within 30 minutes or so. Unfortunately, the wifi was in and out our whole stay, but Jim was responsive about it. While we didn’t pursue getting the issue resolved (we weren’t at the house much, so it just didn’t feel worth it to worry about), Jim offered to come over to take a look, and we feel confident he would’ve gotten it resolved. He actually refunded us part of our fee for the trouble… so kind! The hosts left muffins on the island for us, which was so thoughtful (and awesome particularly for our 5 year old… she was excited)! And we really appreciated the cold waters in the fridge after a 20+ hour trip. I think it’s important to note the home is older (i.e. no central A/C, uneven floors, smaller spaces, etc) - so as long as that’s your vibe, you should have a great stay!"

Stayed a few nights","Jim and Marilyn’s place was wonderful. They went above and beyond to provide thoughtful touches and had everything necessary for a very comfortable “home away from home”. When I updated my reservation to add my friend who decided to join me, Jim messaged and offered to convert the futon into a bed without me even asking - I was really impressed with his care and attention to this small detail that I didn’t assume he’d think to take care of on our behalf. This level of care is obvious as you peruse the unit - outlets next to every bedside for easy charging, lots of snacks and drinks available for you to take, kitchen full of tools and spices for your cooking convenience! The beds were comfy and the linens spotless, along with everything else extremely well kept. I would stay here again in a heartbeat and you should, too!!!!"

Stayed a few nights","Jim’s place was well-kept and clean and very comfortable. Stayed two nights in mid-February after a decent snowfall, so the off-street parking was nice and in a quiet neighborhood. Check-in was easy with clear instructions. The additional refreshments were a nice touch. A nice breakfast restaurant was a short walk away (about 5-minute walk) and other bars and restaurants downtown were about a 10-minute walk away. Overall, the stay was pleasant and convenient and Jim’s place is highly recommended, particularly if you want easy access to downtown Janesville."

We did most of our own cooking and enjoyed having the spacious kitchen. The living room is also very comfortable for watching movies. There is a small Mexican restaurant and grocery store around the corner. Though small, we were able to get some basic items like eggs and bacon. We took several walks and the neighborhood is very family friendly and walkable."

Stayed a few nights","Jim's Airbnb was the perfect location for our adventure in Janesville. The neighborhood is quiet with lovely landscaping and a back patio to enjoy on a nice day. We found the place to be comfortable and cozy. The kitchen was equipped with all the basics and more including some fun snacks! We loved exploring downtown Janesville which was only a 10 min walk away. The ice age trail and bike trails are very close. We biked the Peace trail to Beloit/back and the Glacial river trail to Fort Atkinson and back. We also hiked the Ice age trail. Jim's communication was always helpful and prompt. I notice the little extras that aren't necessary with an airbnb but convenient. I appreciated the plug ins/USB outlets next to the bed on both sides, the easy keypad entry, the coffee options, the water/snacks/games provided, accessible shower and great water pressure, the fresh flowers, and the restaurants/brewery suggestions. We feel like we made friends in Janesville and look forward to coming back!! Thank you Jim and Marilyn!!"

My friend and I were in the area for Wisconsin Sheep And Wool Festival and we loved having a homey place to relax and catch up. It was only a short walk to many wonderful restaurants. The front porch was a very peaceful place to sit as well. The only thing I would advise is to let Jim know if you would like to use the futon as a bed. We assumed we would just be able to make it up ourselves when we came home after dinner the first night. But there was no extra bedding in the unit. When we contacted Jim he brought bedding and a nice pad for the second night.
I would most certainly recommend this place!"

And the apartment is a short walk to downtown shops, restaurants, and the Rock River. The set up is really nice too. For a small space, my husband and I could be together or sneak off alone to the bedroom, sitting area in the front of the house, or to the living room by the electric fire. We decided we needed a place like this at home--a she shed for me and a writing shack for my Paul! :-)"

The apartment is located close enough to interstate to get to Madison or other areas you may want to visit. We walked to the downtown area, which isn't thriving, but does have some nice restaurants and small town charm. Gas and quick stops are nearby as well. This place in great for 3 people, but could probably accommodate a couple more, depending on how friendly the group is. There is a BBQ, if you are visiting family or just want to chill. We like the Janesville area, and this was a perfect stopover that is priced right!"

Stayed a few nights","Incredible! I've stayed in airbnb properties in major cities across the country...who woulda guessed that this hidden gem in tiny Janesville, WI would be my favorite??? Every aspect of the stay was great:
- Space and amenities were as described
- Apartment was spotless
- Tons of options for TV...had cable and Roku
- Wifi and internet were fast and reliable
- Neighborhood is beautiful and the house is walking distance to downtown
- Zero noise from neighbors
- Communication was great, check-in/check-out process were quick and painless
- Tons of clean towels, cloths, linens
The final touch that put this over the top was the fully stocked kitchen. I walked in and noticed muffins on the counter and thought to myself, ""Oh, that's a nice touch."" I unpacked my stuff and was about to head to the grocery store, but stopped to open the fridge quickly to see if maybe there was a bottled water because I was thirsty. The fridge was full...yogurt, water, juice, adult beverages... Then I looked in the freezer and there were pizzas... Then I looked in the pantry and there were snacks from top to bottom. On top of that, the coffee and tea selection was the best I've seen at an airbnb. Jim and Marilyn know how to host."

Fresh flowers, options to snack on, beverages, clean linen and towels, bathroom appliances, and I could go on and on.

I think we only really noticed this aspect because we have two small children and a dog. Otherwise the neighborhood seemed nice. There was a hidden park nearby that was great for us to walk to and it was very easy to get to and from a number of things in the area. We LOVE the house and felt so at home.

Stayed with kids","The house was perfect for our family of 6 to stay overnight as a halfway point to our final destination. It was very clean, had everything we needed, and some nice extra touches. Very convenient location with lots of restaurants and shopping close by. Felt very safe. Excited to stay again on our way home. Highly recommend!"

Group trip","This home was everything stated and then some. There was lots of great communication, and plenty of answers to my questions prior to arrival. The home itself was absolutely beautiful. From decor to functionality in cleanliness this place was top notch. Everything was labeled and if mechanical had instructions. The beds are super comfortable and the back yard a great place for coffee (from the fully stocked coffee bar) in the morning. We had a slight issue with the dryer, and the host was unbelievably responsive, and had someone there to check on it (and fix it) within a very short time. If I ever go to Janesville again I won't hesitate to stay there."

Stayed a few nights","My daughter graduated from college and I was super nervous and stressed. I decided to rent an Airbnb for the weekend. And I have not made a better decision this year. Due to bad weather, I was late checking in, but once we got there we found a home away from home. Everything was nice and clean, there was so much space, and the kitchen made me rethink my home decor! There were board games and snacks-- my family devoured the Hershey's kisses. The temp in the house was a little crisp but the host left easy step-by-step directions for adjusting the heat. In the meantime, every room was filled with baskets with fluffy blankets for our convenience—tons of things to make my family feel welcome and comfortable.
Since my daughter has graduated from college I most likely will not be returning to the area any time soon, but is it possible that B&S Holdings have other listings? I would rent from them not just anytime but all of the time!!!! Thank you for a great weekend B and S Holdings!"

Kitchen had all that was needed for cooking meals there, including oil, salt and pepper and other spices, a well-stocked spice selection, and she had left a much- appreciated bowl of snacks.
The bedroom was very comfortable, and the bath was well equipped also. The living room was very comfortable for sitting and reading or visiting.
I can’t think of anything we needed that was not available; Christine’s communication was exemplary and thorough. We would be glad to stay there in the future when visiting family in town. Thanks so much, Christine!"

Not in the prettiest of locations with minimal amenities and overpriced at $230/night for the 2 of us, but a pretty cool older home with character that could house way more ppl. Called the owner on Christmas Eve to get the lockbox code and he picked up right away, can’t ask for better service than that."

For any fellow road trippers, we had some minor inconvenience (of our own making) because the garage clearance was too low for us to drive in with our roof rack on. Noting quickly if you’re in a similar position as us."

Stayed with kids","Amazing place to stay with lots of little touches that made it feel like home. Loved that there were snacks and water upon arrival, hand soap, shower gel, blankets, lots of towels, and hangers provided as well as a vacuum which came in handy during a long stay. Beds were super comfortable and the location is very quiet (could hear birds chirping in the morning). Well decorated, modern, and perfectly clean. A few things to know- water pressure in showers is really strong, there is only one tv (no tvs in bedrooms, which for us turned out to be a plus), there is a toaster oven instead of a toaster. None of these detracted from our stay and were easy to adjust to. House also has a peaceful backyard with a great grill and patio furniture. Would love to stay here again!"

Stayed over a week","This place was perfect for our needs! And Kevin was very helpful and a great host! We moved from another state and were closing on a house and needed somewhere to stay for a month on very short notice. Our original choice booking was booked by someone else; however, Kevin helped by letting us know he also had this property, which we think turned out even better for us. It’s spacious inside and out (nice two-car garage and long driveway), has a lot of useful starters like toiletries, laundry supplies, coffee, etc. Water pressure is awesome for showers and lots of hot water. It’s tucked back in a quiet, nice neighborhood, yet has close access to shopping and major roads. We cannot say enough about our host Kevin! Very kind, easy to talk to, always available, never intrusive; he took a lot of pressure off of our very stressful moving transition. I highly recommend this location and I highly recommend Kevin as a host!"

Kevin was great to communicate with and made it so easy to reserve the home and responded quickly! This was a great stay-cation even though I still had to work from home. It has a nice downstairs with a desk and chair if you need to have a quiet place to work. The place was super clean (huge bonus points), kitchen has everything you need with all the amenities. Loved the added bonus of the snacks on the island! If you have dogs there is a nice backyard space that they will be able to run around in. I would highly recommend this place if you are in the area. The neighborhood was very quiet, but yet you are close to many places to go and eat and shop. If I needed to stay somewhere close to home again, this is the first place I would reserve! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️/5"

I did have a zen inscent burning during my stay which I didn’t know was against the rules, I then got billed $200 for “smoking in the residence.” I don’t smoke. I Wish the rules were more clear so there would be no mishaps, also wasn’t aware I had to leave the place completely spotless, due to there being a cleaning fee."

All great and thank you."

The open-floorplan downstairs area has a kitchen, a living room with an easy to use and comfy fireplace, and a dining area. There's also a dining table with chairs and a combo Keurig/regular coffeemaker. The upstairs was very cozy too, with a very comfortable larger bed, skylights (with Roman shades for nighttime), another bathroom with a tub, and a large closet space with hangers which was useful for clothing since we were staying for several days. There's a deck on the second floor with seating, which was awesome for coffee on brisk October mornings. The surrounding area is lovely, with the lake across the street, a wooded area behind, and restaurants a short drive away. It's a great location for quick drives to Madison, and during our stay we also visited Milwaukee and the House on the Rock. Our host, Jamie, was super responsive and a pleasure to work with. Thank you for a fantastic experience!"

The area is very pretty you have many tall trees around you, a small view of the lake & friendly neighbors.
It was quiet which was perfect!
Very relaxing.

There was maintenance needed inside as well such as getting the cold water to work in the shower - it was too hot to be comfortable - and fixing the bathroom light switch so it stayed on. Adding nicer accommodations such as basic bedside tables and comfortable living room furniture would be appreciated. Note that the lake access is a ways down the street at a small public boat launch.

Stayed a few nights","Such an amazing cabin! Jamie was really communicative and checked in on us during our stay, so we really appreciated that. The cabin was beautiful and clean. Really liked having a full kitchen and having central heat in a cabin was really helpful. The deck lights up at night so my bf and I were able to sit out and hang out to some calmness, something we don't get much in Chicago. We really enjoyed downtown Edgerton as well! Met some kind locals that made the trip even more memorable. Highly recommend it and would love to come back! :)"

We enjoyed cooking on a lovely stove and eating at the cabin. The outdoor deck has plenty of comfortable furniture and is very peaceful, next to a large white pine tree and shag bark hickory tree. We didn’t have any trouble with mosquitos.
We had a great time playing music on Amazon’s Alexa, and going for walks in the interesting neighborhood.
The bedroom upstairs isn’t large, but it was large enough for the three of us to have three separate beds, one being on the floor.
Everything was very clean, and we felt safe.
Jamie is a great communicator, very responsive and helpful.
We hope to stay at this cabin again!"

Not for those with any mobility issues due to the stairs and the limited use of the upstairs bathroom. Downstairs Bathroom with shower stall did need a shower mat which we left at the cabin as the vinyl shower stall is very slippery during a shower.
Would have appreciated a manual on what remote was needed for what ever appliance/ light or TV needed. Not everyone is accustomed to having everything on a remote."

Stayed a few nights","Highly recommend Jamie & Kayla's cabin for a 2 person getaway. The place was exactly as described, very clean, everything smelled nice, and had some nice extras (plenty of shampoo & conditioner, makeup wipes, tampons in the bathrooms, a little basket with beach towels, water bottles, sunscreen & bug spray, etc). The deck had a nice little view of the lake, and is bordered on one side by trees, giving it a more secluded and woodsy feel than expected. We loved the bedroom opening up to the deck, and the whole cabin is a study in well used space, as well as being very cute (by far the cutest, most cabin-y place on the street). Wouldn't recommend if you have a toddler or crawler, due to the open stairway and spacing on the deck rail, but it's perfect for 2 people, or 2 adults + a kid old enough to not fall off a deck but young enough to not creep you out sleeping on the little bed 2 feet from you.
The area was very peaceful (we were there during the week).
We also found some good bars & breweries within a 25 minute drive - for some reason there's no public beach on this lake, but there are a few on Lake Mills 25 minutes away. Recommend hitting Sunset Bar & Grill (15 min drive)."

We took our kids for the mile walk to visit the lake and we enjoyed this (as we are the walking type), but it was not the daily fishing trip and nature play space we had envisioned.

Everything was above and beyond, from the soap, shampoo and conditioner in the shower, to the makeup remover towelettes and laundry pod to do a load of laundry before returning home. The fireplace added such a cozy feel along with the ability to listen to music on the echo dot. I truly felt like home and that is much appreciated as I get homesick!
