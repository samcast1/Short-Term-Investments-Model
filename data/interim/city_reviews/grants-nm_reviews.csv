Stayed with a pet","The pics don’t do this home justice! This is a great home with lots of space and is much brighter, bigger, and cleaner than I expected because the pics aren’t great. Our family really loved our stay here and if there was availability we would have stayed longer. Overall the house was super clean and had all the amenities that we needed. Plus Angel was incredibly communicative."

Stayed one night","What a unique experience! Never stayed in an RV before— and I’d happily do it again. All the comforts of home. Great night’s sleep. Super cozy. And what a setting — with the mountains in the background, in the middle of Indian Country. Lovely hosts, who clearly care about their little sanctuary in paradise. Plus— a great breakfast. Truly memorable."

Stayed a few nights",Jeff and Betta were welcoming from the time we arrived. The Cowboy Cruiser was spotlessly clean and the view from the picture window was so relaxing. Our breakfast omlet by Chef Ryan was delicious and included a yogurt parfait with fresh berries which was simply amazing. Jeff & Betta are the perfect hosts and could not recommend this place highly enough!

Stayed one night","We had such a wonderful stay with Jeff and Beata. They are so hospitable, kind and genuine. Breakfast was amazing. Cooked to order, very filling and made with locally sourced, delicious ingredients. Understand that you are staying in a camper, not a hotel. Set your expectations right and you will fall in love with their wonderful bed and breakfast. Also, it is a very dark sky location and stargazing is wonderful. We loved every minute of our stay."

Stayed one night","Jeff's place made up our quirkiest accommodations on a trip to Arizona and New Mexico. It's off the beaten path but there's some really pretty country nearby and it was a nice change of place from more crowded destinations, like Sedona.
The ""Cowboy Cruiser"" was more spacious than we expected, and the bed was eminently comfortable. The shower was fine, considering it's inside an RV.
The best part about staying here is Jeff himself. He's a good chef (we requested a vegetarian meal for dinner in addition to the usual breakfast) and we enjoyed talking with him very much as we ate and afterwards. It turns out he's married to a Polish woman from a city that my wife and I had visited and loved, so it was fun to hear about that.
So, if you want to be far from the madding crowd, with a great host and a quiet location and good food, Mountain Harmony just might be what you are looking for."

Super clean, the camper had every amenity an adventurous couple could ask for, the scenery, serenity, amenities galore, and a delicious made to order breakfast in the host’s own cafe restaurant. We thoroughly enjoyed visiting with Jeff the morning before we left. We would come again and highly recommended the experience to others."

Stayed one night","We were only here for a place to rest our head while on a road trip but it was such a great stay. The RV was cozy and stocked with all the essentials. Made a little dinner in the RV. Note: stop in Yuni for groceries before heading to the RV as there is very limited options in Ramah. The best part of this stay was Jeff. He was very hospitable, great conversation, and provides a delicious breakfast which was such an added bonus. This location is very peaceful. Go ahead and book, you won't be disappointed. Thanks again Jeff."

Additionally, the breakfasts were delicious, and Jeff was always available in case we had any questions."

Stayed one night","What a totally unique experience! This was my first time in NM and my first time staying in an RV! I was a little apprehensive as I’m travelling alone and of course it doesn’t get more remote than this.
Beata & Jeff are the best, so warm and friendly and make you feel right at home. Jeff was quick to help me charge up my electric car and help with the air conditioning.
I had a very comfortable and cozy nights sleep and waking up to the most amazing sunset was bliss.
Beata made a wonderful breakfast, so healthy and tasty. Was great to have a home cooked meal to send me on my travels. I will absolutely be back. Can’t thank them enough 😁🙏😎"

Stayed one night",The hosts have to be the best part. Very responsive. Very attentive and thoughtful. GET THE HOME COOKED DINNER IF YOU ARRIVE IN TIME. It was incredible! This was our first time to stay in an RV trailer — it was very windy this time of year. Everything was perfect. Couldn’t have been happier! The pictures are accurate. The breakfast was to die for!!! I hate that we couldn’t finish it all. Great stay!

Getting to have Jeff to cook with us and have conversations with was the best! Jeff really understands what hospitality is all about. He was helpful with all the little details of our stay. He also gave good advice about what to see in the area. And there is a lot to see and do in that area. I can’t recommend Mountain Home retreat enough!

Stayed a few nights","So many good things to say about this property, so where do I begin: (in no special order)
1) Location, location, location….central to so many things, it’s a great base (Gallup, Grants, El Morro, El Malpais, Ice Cave, etc.)
2) Unique accommodation…camper beat a traditional hotel, for sure! Had everything you’d need. Included bottled water and snacks..very nice touch!
3) Camper was super clean
4) Food was excellent! Great value to include breakfast, and it was a hearty one at that. I also purchased dinner both nights, and the fare rivaled restaurant quality. Soup, salad, entree, dessert…all delicious and with a great presentation. I ate in the cafe area, which was very pleasant.
5) Hosts - they seem like very kind, sincere people. They have a great “vibe”
I’d definitely stay again, but want to stay longer. Thank you Beata & Jeff. Dziekuje! 😀"

Stayed one night","Great location, full delicious breakfast included. Pick 1 out multiple choices , coffee, oj, the whole 9 yards made fresh to order and delivered to where u like . Little patio is awesome with the bunnies running around with view , hmm pretty awesome. Dinner usually offered (for a great price) and is made to order delicious . Soup is like from the old country (Poland ) awesome , you will never taste again unless you move to Europe.
Salad (mustard dressing is a home run) entree changes with your tastes in mind. Ice cream with lemon cello from Sardinia. Hmm, while watching the sunset . Super comfy bed , awesome sheets, full WiFi and Verizon.
This is the country , wildlife ,
Stars like you never seen, Views with every turn, friendly locals. Best of New Mexico with out a doubt."

Stayed one night","Great spot to land whether passing thru on a road trip, or taking a planned trip to see the myriad of majestic natural wonders that abound in this part of the country. There’s so much to see within driving distance of this place, you really should stay several days or longer if possible. And make sure you take them up on the offer for dinner (a small charge and totally worth it!) or any other meal besides the included breakfast, because the food they make is certainly on par with a nice restaurant’s quality, if not gourmet. I had the best soup of my life there! And everything was masterfully done, none of it overly fancy or seasoned, just inspired straightforward and delicious real ingredients with love. Plus they can suit it to any taste, although I strongly recommend you go with chef’s choice (otherwise it’s like only handing Picasso two or three colors of paint.. ya know?!). Nothing beats a homemade meal done right, which they certainly do. Plus there ain’t much else around if anything at all to choose from anyways, so they actually could be serving lower quality food and get away with it, but they would never do that - they are really good people who want to treat others right and well, and they do. Even if there are other choices around, I would stay right here every time. The place was so peaceful and serene, such a good vibe and welcoming feeling from the hosts, that honestly it took me a little longer to leave than I intended! You may well get that feeling too, at least a little bit, like you don’t want to leave: this place not only refreshes your energy better than a hotel stay would, but I swear even your soul can get a refresh here if you allow it to. The property, the place, and the access to so many ways to spectacularly connect to nature are all big parts of what makes this a great experience.. then add to that the great hosts and that’s what puts it over the top as such a special stay. This is the place you go stay for 5-7 days to totally get away and come out of it feeling completely refreshed and renewed and reconnected to yourself and what really matters. But it is also perfect for someone passing thru for the night, far better than a hotel - there’s no comparison. It’s a great RV with everything you need and more, and very private. Mind that you are not going to get an unlimited amount of hot water in the shower at one time, but you can get a good one if you don’t dally. As a tall person, the shower head was even with mine, but it is the removable style with a hose so no problem. I was so fulfilled by the day of touring around, the fabulous dinner, the great company, the infinite stars you see at night and the sweet clean air that I didn’t even want to turn on the TV when I retired to my quarters. I just enjoyed how peaceful and still it all was, that I had no walls shared with others, how great it felt to be where the hosts were so kind and caring and available yet will gladly leave you to yourself if that’s what you want.. that I just sat there for awhile appreciating what seemed like one of the few spots left in the world where things are not rushed nor constantly demanding. Then I did some reading and writing before passing out and sleeping wonderfully. The outside air can cool down a lot at night which makes for great slumber, but there is a heater available if needed that works fine to warm the unit. I decided to turn it off and just got under the big comforter and slept like a log. After a few days on the road in thankless slacking overpriced hotels that seemingly drained more energy than they replenished, this was the splendid respite I sorely needed to refresh my body and spirit. Like I said, the hosts being that perfect balance of happily there to make your stay the best it can be, yet at the same time they aren’t prying or spying or micro-managing you like some other hosts can do. After a meal at the really cool main house that looks like a former bar/restaurant inside on the first floor and has a beautiful mural and awesome artwork displayed, you can sit outside on the covered or uncovered portion of the decks and chat with others, walk up one flight of stairs to the upper porch and see the dormant volcanoes on the nearby horizon then catch a glorious sunset above majestic reefs right there, or you can head on back to your space or on your way with no issue at all. I was able to totally relax and unwind there like you cannot really do at most places. Very grateful, much love. P.S. the GPS can have you several miles off from this place so follow the host’s short easy directions to find the place at the end"

We had no idea that there is literally no where else to eat for 40 miles. Jeff and Beatta (not sure if that’s right) were happy to feed us after our long trip! The food was colorful and delicious!! (Additional charge-we we’re happy to pay!) Watched an amazing sunset and took off after a scrumptious breakfast for a hike! We just love the place and the hosts!

For those looking for proximity to the epic mountain biking available in both the Zuni Mountains and Mt. Taylor, this is a GREAT spot for a base camp! Having grown up in the area, I was impressed to see somebody start up a quality lodging option on the “back side” of the Zuni mountains right next to El Morro National Monument. This is a well kept secret that needs to get out for lovers of natural beauty and hiking/mountain biking adventures. Kudos to Jeff!"

A bonus for us was seeing snowcapped Mount Taylor in the distance. The old cantina ruins on the property were impressive to see! Being this close to the continental divide while staying in a spectacularly cozy adobe seemed almost unreal. The rooms were just spacious enough and the common area was perfect for us. The kitchen was well equipped and home was wonderfully stocked with all the basic necessities! If ever on this route again I would definitely book here again and stay longer! We definitely missed out by only booking one night!"

Incredibly clean, toasty thanks to the pellet stove (which the kids loved watching) and it has everything you could possibly need in the kitchen, even a crock pot :-). We were able to shop at Smith's grocery store, cook each night and make sandwiches for our days out in El Malpais. If we were in the area again we would stay again for sure and would highly recommend the place to others."

It was a bit far from town, but at least some places in Grants do deliver there if the 15-20 minutes to town feels like too much after a long day taking in everything to do in the area. And there’s a LOT! Even without leaving the yard there was stargazing at night and watching the local wildlife like jackrabbits and (I think?) a fox bounding through the area around the house. Our host was also really responsive and helpful with suggestions about what to do. Overall a great experience and I wish we could have spent more time there."

The CDT is just 5 minutes down the road, so we were able to enjoy a small section of a very long trail after a long day on the road. The star gazing at night was excellent, with zero light pollution! Absolutely peaceful and relaxing; we will definitely be back!"

When the pellet stove didn’t start immediately, he walked me through the simple steps of getting it going and made restaurant recommendations. His response time was amazingly fast and friendly. We loved the house, location, and amenities and would definitely stay again and recommend Michael's home- especially if traveling with pets. Bravo!! 6 stars!"

Stayed a few nights","I booked Michael's place for my husband and his buddy to get away for a long weekend. Communication was flawless and easy. Michael was accessible and offered suggestions for hikes (and left brochures) for their stay. They had arrived early to go out to hike and were to check in around 3. Shortly before noon, I contacted my husband with the horrific news that our son and severed his thumb at the shop and was to go into emergency surgery. My husband left while his buddy remained. We hoped that my husband could return, but our son endured a 9-hour surgery and went to ICU. My husband was prepared to go from ABQ to Grants to honor the check-out instructions. I reached out to Michael and explained the situation requesting the instructions to vacate. Michael was wonderful and so very understanding and said not to worry about it. He also extended the offer of a discount when we could return. His generosity and understanding during our emergency meant the world to us."

Stayed with a pet","We rebooked before we even left, that’s how much we liked it. Even though Grants, NM is not exactly a “destination” town, the landscape, mood and climate are quintessential New Mexico. IYKYK. We looked forward to a few days being off the grid, biking and book reading. Michael and Kendra’s AirBnb was the perfect Santa Fe-style home for our purposes. The home was exactly as pictured, nestled in a mountainous valley with very few neighbors, just 6 or so miles outside Grants. We felt as if we were on our own out there. Everything we need was there. We appreciated cooking for ourselves, having our two pups with us, and watching La Vuelta at night. The home was meticulously clean and the premises were neat and taken care of. We couldn’t believe the overall silence out there and the clarity of the moon-lit evenings. Michael went beyond his duties and helped us with routed gravel and mountain biking trails. He always responded within minutes. We are so grateful to come back to this valley!"

Stayed with a pet",This location was beautiful! Check in was very smooth and the host was very good with communication from the start of booking. The surrounding scenery is jaw dropping and the sunset was so gorgeous. The home fit the setting perfectly and it had everything you need and more. The backyard was great if you are traveling for dogs. The only negative for our stay is that there is only one cooling unit for the entire home. That unit is located right when we walk into the home on the wall and is used to cool the entire home which unfortunately it did not for us. There were three of us that stayed and we used two of the three bedrooms. At night it was very uncomfortable due to no moving air with fans or any AC reaching the rooms. Due to the time of the year and the high temperatures it was difficult for us to relax and cool down from our travels. Other than that it was absolutely perfect!

It was easy to find and simple to get in (even though we didn’t arrive until after midnight) the porch light was left on and that was very helpful. If we need to make this trip again I will definitely try to stay here again. Thank you!"

The host was so communicative, understanding of my circumstances when I needed to switch arrival dates, allowed me to do check in early, gave me advice on local weather and road conditions, as well as was kind enough to give me some fire wood! I definitely recommend this spot. I’ve stayed in two of the cabins so far: Bear and Horse. Both are so darling and cozy with the perfect SW Cabin feel. Unfortunately I was only able to visit Sunday afternoon-Monday afternoon so I missed out on Ancient Cafe open hours. Keep in mind that this cafe is pretty much the only place to get food for many miles so look up when they are open if you don’t plan to bring your own food and drinks. The ‘town’ is very small & quiet with beautiful surroundings great for wanting to be remote and doing some trails in El Morro. Wild Wolf Sanctuary is an awesome organizations to visit nearby!"

Stayed with a pet","Beautiful area of New Mexico! Besides the amazing night sky, the immediate area has many hiking options; with one trailhead, literally, in the back yard of this cabin.
If you choose to use the wifi....internet service / speed handled everything I did with no issue (downloaded and streamed through apps using the Roku TV in the room).
The host is extremely nice, responsive, and provided everything just as stated in the listing. No negative surprises.
I grabbed the special of the day from the Cafe on my way out this morning. Very friendly service and pizza sandwich was awesome! (That had to have been homemade bread/sub that it was served on!)
I'm already planning my next trip and will likely book it this week!"

This cabin, number 1, is practically identical to cabin number 2 which we stayed in previously, except this one has a tub instead of a walk in shower. It's a very beautiful area, and very quiet on these holidays we have come out."

When I arrived at night it was foggy so a flashlight would have been helpful. But instructions are clear and you can easily arrive to the cabins by mapping Ancient Way Cafe. The cafe is also conveniently located just a walk from the cabin. Super tasty vanilla chai. And pet friendly airbnb.

The horse theme was very special to me as was the Native American Indian paintings on the wall since I love both those animals and cultures. I am the woven rugs on the floor and the bedspread and the curtains all matched perfectly. Very vibrant colors very homey and comfy~that extra blanket help keep me very warm and snuggly. The cabin had everything that you could need and want~all the dinnerware, flatware, utensils to cook with and the coffee pot….even two pieces of chocolate to curb your sweet tooth before sleep and the bathtub with the feet was really a fun way to take a bath.
It even snowed overnight, which was a delightful surprise in the morning to find snowy powder over everything mountains all around just a magical fairy tale kind of place. I will definitely come back if I’m in the area."

You’re also close to El Malpais, which features several dormant volcanoes, caves and lava fields. We checked out the Ice Cave and Bandera Crater, well worth it if you don’t have many hours to give the El Malpais trails. Just be aware that if you are not from or familiar with the SW that distances are deceiving, you will be driving a lot and a long time to get places. This place was perfect for us, in the middle of a lot of the places we wanted to see and really cozy after long days of driving and hiking around. Be sure to check out the sculpture trail behind the cabins as well!"

Stayed one night","Lovely wood cabin in a quiet and very beautiful area. The beds are very comfortable, the cabin is clean and well organized with many electrical outlets (none in the loft), the water and the coffee are very good. The kitchen is well supplied and there are a refrigerator and a burner for cooking (we didn't use it). There is a television (we didn't watch it) and the WiFi is good. The bathroom is small but functional, the claw-foot tub is fun to use. Our only comment is that the ceiling of the loft is low (cannot stand up) and the ladder to access the loft is steep. Our athletic kid had no problems, but groups with more than two mature adults may want to consider another cabin. The cabin is right behind the Ancient Ways cafe, which is very good, and next to the Sculpture Trail, which is a short fun walk with beautiful views. The sculpture are quite interesting. It is a great place to relax while visiting the area. We will be back."

It was clean, very comfortable and had everything we needed. The restaunt on premise was amazing too! The only thing that was a problem was that there were a good amount of people that weren't following the pets must be on a leash rule. This was a problem for us when someone's small dog tried running up and barking at ours and the owner did not come over to grab it. If you have a dog that is not good with other dogs (like ours), you're fine to stay there, but just be very aware of the other dogs around to make sure there are no issues. I would still highly recommend this cabin."

The night sky is breathtaking due to there being no light pollution. I stayed one night with my dog as we were passing through. The trails right from the cabin were great for dog walks. We also visited the nearby ice cave and volcano crater.

I was there Sunday to Wednesday, so haven’t yet had the opportunity to try their restaurant, but the microwave and hot plate were adequate for making my morning coffee and heating the food I’d brought with me. I’m glad our host makes that clear. The early fall colors were beautiful and the sculpture garden a peaceful place that also brought laughter. I highly recommend going out of the way to get here."

Ancient Cafe is wonderful but only open from 9am-5pm Thursday to Sunday-if you are going there when it is closed-and if you want alcoholic beverages-stock up before you leave the last shopping spots of Gallup or Grants. There is an open gas station in Ramah - a lot of the others are boarded up on the way there. Lovely area and El Morro is stunning. Everyone is very friendly! No cell phone service but old fashioned pay phone at the Cafe-great wifi and directv!

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed our stay in the tiny cabin in El Morro. The bed in the loft was a little tricky to get into but once settled, the little window next to the bed let in a nice cool breeze while sleeping. We got 2 nice fluffy towels to shower with and cups, bowls and silverware for our oatmeal and tea in the morning. The little fridge works great and small freezer kept our frozen stuff frozen. It was quiet and peaceful at night and the smell of juniper and pine after a rain at dawn was fantastic. We discovered the Sculpture walk right before we left for home and I'm so glad we didn't miss it! If you do nothing else, walk the garden to see all of the unusual sculptures. At the top of the trail, there's a narrow path that leads you up to a view point to see El Morro! The little cafe in Ramah, called Stagecoach Cafe, made a nice big breakfast we enjoyed."

The little kitchenette is well-equipped, the cabin is cute as a button and neat as a pin, and Brandon and his assistants were very helpful and accommodating of our needs. No phone service but the wifi worked well. The sculpture trail was cool; unfortunately we couldn't hike El Morro because the visitors' center doesn't open before 9:00 am and we had to be on our way. Hope to return. (BTW - Our GPS wanted to send us five miles further down the road than the actual location of the cabin; just look out for the Cafe one mile after the turn off to El Morro.)"

The wifi at this location is not great — you need to step outside of the cabin to connect to it; otherwise, I didn’t have any service on my phone. This wasn’t a problem for us, but if you are hoping to work remotely out of this cabin, it might be for you. (But why worry about wifi when you can spend the day on the trails!)"

Pam and Jon are terrific hosts, always willing to help and have furnished the cabin with love and great attention to detail. I enjoyed my peppermint tea on the porch watching several humming birds at the feeder. Pam and Jon made me feel very much at home here, even inviting me along to a community event. You’ll have everything you need at the cabin - utensils, pots, pans, gas stove, washing up equipment and the bed is extremely comfortable.

Not to mention we had a 160 pd Great Dane with us. Most hotels have a weight limit. It was great being able to let him out and walk around. It was a very quick visit as we were moving to Az but I would definitely stay there again. The only thing I would say is there is no tv but it was fine for us.

Stayed with a pet","This was a great stay! I wish we had planned for a few more nights at Kara’s place because it was so comfortable and relaxing. We stopped overnight in the middle of a camping roadtrip and the clean, quiet space with a hot shower and amazing bed was exactly what we needed! I’ll definitely be staying here next time I’m in town."

Stayed with a pet","On our move from Oregon to Texas, we needed a last minute place to stay for the last night and this cute place was available. The owners were incredibly quick to respond, gave detailed instructions on how to check-in to the gated home. Once we arrived, we had everything we needed to prep for the final day of travel -- a full bathroom, full kitchen to keep our food cold, a place for my bicycle, a yard for my dogs to walk and take potty, a reading area with comfy blankets... loved it all. I am so thankful and would recommend this cute little place for anyone traveling. I appreciated the quick communication and felt very seen by Kara. Thank you both for allowing us the stay here :)"

Stayed with a pet","The directions were excellent, entry simple, and the accommodation was wonderful - spacious, light, clean, well equipped, and comfortable. It was nice and quiet in the evening and it was warm enough to sit out on the porch. We were traveling with a dog across country and our hosts couldn't have been more helpful with explaining their property, fencing, and suggesting ways we could exercise our pet. Whether you are staying one night or longer in the Albuquerque area this is a lovely spot - you could get work done and also just enjoy fresh air and stars. In season the garden must be spectacular as well - we enjoyed the cherry trees. Thank you!"

The property is very nice. I love how conscious they are with treading lightly, recycling, and generally being mindful. The neighbour’s dogs announced our arrival and departure. Once you were out of their eyesight, they were quiet. The property is very peaceful, otherwise. (Kara has a dog who was so quiet we almost did not notice). The town of Peralta is relaxed (not busy like Albuquerque."

Stayed with a pet","We needed to attend a family gathering in the area so we were so happy to find a dog friendly place. We knew from the pictures that we would be comfortable in the casita, and we were. The space is very open and comfortable, especially the bed. Normally we cook when at Airbnb’s, but since we were attending a family gathering we didn’t need to this time. But being the cook that I am I checked out the kitchen closely. Pots and pans are important to me and this kitchen was well stocked for cooking and eating. The best part was being able to take our dog on walks in the morning along the ditch. The Sandhills cranes and ducks flying over head (in winter), plus the wild peacocks made it special to us. As a gardener I would come back in summer just to see what the owners do with their yard. There is a lovely outdoor space, especially in the summer I am sure. If we need to come back to the area it’s good to know where there is a comfortable place and space."

The bed was very comfortable. I left for the evening to attend church and when I returned they even left the porch light on for me so I could easily see the entry.
Thank you Kara and Lynda, you guys are the best! Next time I'm in town I'll definitely see if your place is available.

Stayed one night","Highly recommend. This space was even better than I expected! This stand alone casita felt newly built with all the amenities on what appears to be a small family farm or homestead situation. I was there on a quick overnight stop so I didn’t cook although they had a few appliances like an induction burner and a shallow countertop oven in the case you need to prepare meals. The bed was comfortable. The shower was beautifully tiled with good water pressure. Streaming apps were logged in on both TVs (living & bedroom) so I could unwind with a movie. The only negative was that the internet was too slow for streaming without pausing to buffer every 2-3 minutes. So. I logged the TV in to my personal hotspot via Verizon and it worked great.
Next time I’m in the area, I would love to book this spot again. Thanks for having me!"

We had arrived late in the day so we didn’t get the chance to see them but we woke up and spent some time watching them have breakfast. Our little girl was in love with them and gave a sense of calm before another long day of travel. Great property, easy access from the 40 and I had wished we had more time to explore the nearby outdoor activities."

Taylor, El Malpais, Ice Cave & Bandera Volcano & El Morro). Would definitely stay here if visiting again."

We were very happy to discover Pete & Nicole's place - it was easy to find, spotless inside, comfortable, and quiet. Pete & Nicole responded immediately to our questions and sent information to my sister's phone when I could not get reception on mine. We plan to stay here again next time we go to the Navajo rug auction in Crownpoint."

It is clean and welcoming with comfortable furniture and a TV in the bedroom (we love that!). The bathroom is one of the cleanest we've had during our trip and the shower was actually our favorite thing. It's HUGE! The king-sized bed is so very comfortable and the linens are clean and fresh. The space is actually much bigger than it looks in the photos. It is close to I40. We arrived after dark and it was easy to find. The hosts gave specific instructions on where to park and how to get in and that was super helpful. We walked our dog in the neighborhood and for the short time we were there, we felt right at home. Fast WiFi for those (like me) who have to work on the road. We would definitely return if we find ourselves in the area. Book with confidence."

The bed was very comfortable as well and we got a great nights sleep while on the road. There’s several food places and a walmart right up the road. The air conditioner worked well for the summer heat and we were able to park on property, which always makes me feel more comfortable when traveling instead of street parking. There are a few amenities available if you forget something- shampoo/soap and a keurig coffee machine. Utensils as well, but anything else- plan on bringing (water bottles, ice mold, toothpaste, hair dryer, etc.) great spot if looking for a quiet night to rest!"

The home was very clean and tidy and there was more than adequate heating througout the home during our winter stay. The host/hostess responded quickly to our inquiries and provided helpful recommendations. For those traveling to/from the Phoenix area from this rental, we found that the driving time of about 6 hours was perfect for us. There are several sit-down and fast food restaurants within 5-10 minutes. This property is located next to a dirt/gravel road very close to the main highway and appears to be the nicest and best maintained home in the surrounding area. In fact, it was a pleasant surprise to enter the home and feel as though we were walking into a new model home!"

We showed up right after booking, about 15 minutes early so they were still cleaning which probably explains why it didn't feel fully clean when we got inside. We had to run the vacuum over the couch to get rid of some dog hair and I quickly wiped down the toilet as I saw a few hairs on the seat. Not a big deal and again, we likely unintentionally made them feel rushed. The bed was comfortable and shower hot with good water pressure. Adding a shelf or stand in the shower to put soap/shampoo would be good, as well as getting a couple bed-side tables for phones and water. We had a nice dinner at the local steakhouse a few miles away. Would stay again if passing through."

Stayed one night","I enjoyed staying at Pete & Nicole's. Last year I stayed at their other spot on the same property. I liked this one way better. The bed was super comfy, and I didn't want to wake up. It's a great spot to stop if you travel with pets. And walking down the little road with my dog was easy. It doesn't have a fenced yard for the dog, but it was easy to take her for a walk."

Note: you may hear the sound of a cow mooing as if it’s in the room next door. It’s more charming than annoying and didn’t impact my sleep but good to know so not be surprising."

Outside chairs to relax or even take a walk. I will definitely stay here in the future. You couldn't ask for a better host than Pete & Nicole. Your comfort and stay are at the top of their list. Thank you very much for making my Christmas visit with my daughter and her family a true success."

There’s no coffee table either which is another thing of mine that I wish they did have. Lastly in the shower there’s no place to put your shampoo or body wash unless it’s on the ground, which is not fun to do during the shower time."

Mid-size fridge was helpful. A few baby cows and goats are on the property. That was nice. There is an excitable little dog to greet you every time you open the door. He is behind the fence but appreciated the occasional treats. Near by town Grants, NM has everything you need plus some parks. Blue Water state park which is around 30 miles is a good place to go and relax. Communication was quick and prompt from the hosts. Highly recommended."

She volunteered to refund our stay if we wanted but if we still wanted to travel her way her husband gave us an alternate route or they were willing to meet us and we could follow them. After a rough decision we decided on the refund after looking at the back tracking we would have to do just to get to our next destination. Nicole was so nice about it, we would definitely try to stay at their place next time we travel through the area."

It was easy to find and check in was easy.
One thing folks should know- This is a matter of personal preference of course: anyone who needs a firm mattress for comfort or pain management take note that the mattress was quite soft."

Stayed with a pet","It was a nice place when we first arrived. The bathroom was spacious and clean. I took up the rug and rolled it up to vaccume and that's when I noticed the heavy discoloration of the carpet between what was under the rug and what wasn't, as well as the vaccume that was there wouldnt stay on. That's when I realized why my wife started having allergy issues. I'm just glad we had an air purifier. The bed was comfortable for one person but when there's 2 people we both tilted towards the middle."

Their studio is super cozy, comfortable and great for the price. They even had the heater going for us so it was nice and toasty when we arrived in freezing cold temperature! :)
Since we arrived late on a Sunday night, we stopped in Gallup for dinner before heading to the studio as there were a few more food options available compared to Grants.
Their location was a also quick 15min drive to El Malpais National Monument too, very convenient!
Will definitely stay here again, thanks for having us!"

We really just needed a comfy place to land after lots of driving, and this was it. I would imagine that if you are someone with higher expectations (eg that likes to cook or needs lots of sink space), this isn’t the place for you, but it’s just fine for those of us who don’t need much :)"

Stayed one night","Very seldom have I wholeheartedly and with clear conscience raved in my reviews about an individual AirBnB lodging. Bruce’s cabin in Thoreau is one of those exceptions. From the proactive and thoughtful communications before our arrival, to the moment we set foot on the property, and then when we closed the doors to travel on, I knew I’d found and experienced something special. The cabin overlooks Blue Lake State Park, and the area surrounding the cabin is private, quiet and very peaceful. Bruce has quite a few bird feeders, so you have endless opportunity to birdwatch from the comfort of the screened porch or inside from the large windows that afford wonderful views. Everything inside the cabin is meticulously clean and comfortable, and whatever you might need for cooking or small cleanups is available. I wish I’d planned to stay longer and I’d love to return. This place is indeed very special. My most sincere thanks to our host."

There is a very unique quality to the cabin, with such thoughtful details and warm communication - it was enchanting. Not to mention, Bruce could not have been more accommodating and thoughtful, both when I made a scheduling snafoo and with the wonderful snacks he prepared the space with. My only wish is that we could have spent more time enjoying."

The host is most welcoming and knowledgeable about the area. He's very accommodating, if you wish to have absolute privacy, he will leave you be. Or, he will freely engage with you and offer you a chance to purchase authentic vintage Native American works of art (at a fair price).
I'll probably bring my mother up here one long weekend, here soon"

Stayed a few nights","The McCrae Cabin is is a masterpiece of old world craftsmanship, from the panned windows that let in sunlight in the winter (and the breeze during hot months) to the built-in cabinets to the flawless dowelled hardwood floor. Seriously, if you're a carpenter or a woodworker, come for a night just to check out the living room floor.
The hot tub was hot and easy to use, and the view from it was peaceful. There were a dozen different birds at the well-stocked feeders, red-wing blackbirds, scrub jays, even a Lewis's Woodpecker, a spectacular bird I'd never seen before. The books Bruce left out gave some great context for the area and were perfect for a weekend read.
Bruce's acreage was secluded enough for privacy, but at the end of the road in a charming community where neighbors were close enough (and friendly enough) that we didn't feel completely isolated either--perfect in case of trouble.
Photos don't do this place justice. Bruce was a great host. If you're on the fence, book it."

Stayed a few nights","What a beautiful, private cabin! It is tucked back down a well-maintained dirt road. There are neighbors close by on one side of the property, but the deck and hot tub are on the other side where it’s just a lake view! Bruce is an AMAZING host, we had a slight issue come up during the stay and he was immediately there to fix it. This cabin has everything you could need, every condiment and cooking utensil- Brice even left us some groceries! It is quite far from town, which we loved, but you would want to bring all your food. The fireplace was awesome with pretty much unlimited firewood. The furnace made it nice and warm. We loved the board games and the book collection. It’s fun to watch all the birds and chipmunks in the morning at all the feeders. There is no WiFi, but we had good reception with Verizon. We brought travel speaker and had great music all weekend. Overall this little cabin is just a dreamy place to unplug and unwind!"

Stayed one night","Our days at Bruce's place were a dream! We felt immediately welcome upon arrival, the hot tub and heat comfortably set prior to our arrival. Very thoughtful host providing eggs, butter, coffee & filters, dark chocolate, lots of firewood, extra towels and blankets, snow shovel, and plenty of bird seed. We spent our mornings in the hot tub just watching the birds; evenings in the hot tub looking at the stars, before reading near a cozy fire. Bruce was quick to respond to questions and work with us when we had to extend our stay due to winter weather (which worked out since there wasn't another check-in for that weekday). It was the perfect getaway to start the new year. We'd make it an annual vacation if we could! Thank you, Bruce!"

Stayed one night","Bruce and his cabin are absolutely worth the trip to Thoreau. I really can’t say enough about this place but, I will try.
I was excited when I found this cabin and boy does it not disappoint. It sits over a valley with a wonderful view of the sunrise and is warm and cozy inside. A great place to run the dog(s) out in the morning before getting back in the car.
Bruce feels like a kindred spirit of some sort. He is on top of messaging and making sure you are comfortable and looked after. All of the amenities are wonderful and well maintained, not to mention growing! He has recently added another deck and hot tub that I will have to come back and use at some point. There are new fire pits / grill areas and even a walking trail through the back acreage.
For me, it’s the small things. Bruce had prebuilt a fire for me, all I had to do was light it upon arrival. Stuff like that makes the stay truly wonderful. Thanks Bruce, I will definitely be coming back."

Stayed with a pet","The Macrae Cabin is SUCH an interesting and cozy haven in a cool, high-elevation pine forest. It was a perfect home base for us to visit Chaco Canyon. It's like a house within a house, surrounded by enclosed decks to view the bird feeders and Bluewater Lake. We loved how pet-friendly it is! Bruce really thought of everything, with many special touches.
Bath: hot water for showering; counter space
Bedroom: peaceful; touch-lighting; lots of storage
Kitchen: well-stocked; gourmet goodies & spices; large fridge/freezer; gas stove/oven; microwave; coffee maker & grinder
Laundry: downstairs, didn't use
Living: gorgeous floors & woodwork; tasteful decor; fireplace; comfy furniture; carpet-free (YAY!); lots of books, magazines, & decor relevant to New Mexico
Outdoors: Decks! hot tub for stargazing; lake view from house & nearby platform deck; LOTS of birds at feeders; quiet, forested street for walking
Tech: strong Verizon signal in the cabin for calls and internet

The kitchen is very easy to use with the refrigerator, utensils, spices, pots/pans & oils at a single reach with multiple tables to sit and eat. Multiple places to sit & take in the breathtaking views. Comfortable bed with plenty of storage Very clean & well stocked bathroom. All of the cabin’s art has history (ask Bruce), there’s books and books of historic information available and there’s a plethora of antique items placed around the property.
Bruce is a gold plated platinum host, there wasn’t a question he couldn’t answer and made perfect suggestions for things to do while we were there. Great person, stellar host.
And speaking of things to see, we took hundreds of scenic photos within a 10 mile radius.
It’s an A+ property. Quiet, secluded and relaxing atmosphere … the kind of place you shed a tear or two because you have to leave."

Bruce falls into the 2nd category. He was very accessible and provided all sorts of recommendations for hikes and drives. His cabin was immaculate and fully equipped with everything we needed. What we thoroughly appreciated was his attention to detail and the touches that made his cabin feel like home rather than a rental. He had bird feeders out and provided binoculars and a bird book. We loved the solar lights that led to a beautiful deck and a gorgeous view of the lake. His firepit and fireplace were nicely prepped with wood for a fire. And, he thoughtfully put out fresh fruit, yummy chocolates and refreshing drinks. We had the pleasure of meeting him upon departure and he was a delight. We highly recommend this place to get away from city life."

We travel with our dog and she loves the cabin and the lake. There is lake access from the cabin and also the public access point which is a very short drive (less than a mile.) There were few people at the lake and we had a great time hanging out by the water. The location is peaceful, beautiful and quiet. I cant stay enough about how good the property is 10/10. Thanks again to Bruce and look forward to staying here in the future."

Stayed one night","This was my second stay with Bruce. I had my 85-year-old parents with me; this was their first Airbnb experience. They were impressed. (I knew they would be.) They slept deeply after enjoying a quiet evening by the fireplace. I walked our 90-pound dog around the area, and he found many interesting things to sniff and check out. After my parents turned in for the night, I sat in the hot tub for 20+ minutes, enjoying the silence, the star-filled sky, and the ambiance of his cabin. Bruce is a gentleman. A good, good guy and a wonderful host. We will definitely stay there again, in the fall, on our way back to back to the beaches of Baja Sur, Mexico."

The snow was falling outside and we fell in love with all the windows/exterior sunning room you watch it fall. We only wished we could have stayed longer but now we know exactly where we are staying next time we make the trek to the southwest. Bruce was hands down amazing, he shared so much knowledge on the area and areas to explore and went above and beyond. Especially when I locked the keys inside :/ We loved the living area for reading and every necessity needed for cooking. Bed was super comfy and shower was perfect after the camping the few nights before!"

Stayed one night","No better way to relax amidst a long drive. I wish I had more time to spend, but the evening spent in front of the fire was just what I needed. Great place to unplug. Bruce had food available for a breakfast, tons of other kitchen amenities, clean bathroom and an amazing bed. More time would have been spent on the porch, walking the land, and of course more time in front of the fire! I had forgotten the sweet smell of piñon wood fires.
Very quiet! I felt bad shutting the door of my truck 😂
Perfect getaway for a couple that loves being remote or through travelers like myself.
I stopped off in town and grabbed a burger at Big Ass Burger before heading to the cabin.
I really appreciated the little things like the fresh fruit on the table, the art and pottery collection, and the hand made cards for sale found on the hardwood and turquoise “candy stand” I definitely plan to return and stalk some fish in the lake, hopefully in a few months for the spring muskies! Thanks again Bruce 😀"

The cabin is charming, clean and comfortable. Bruce had turned on the heat for us so that is was nice and warm when we arrived. Our stay was short—and that made the incredibly comfortable bed all the more rewarding. We had a great night sleep!
Our dog enjoyed exploring the property and the rural, quiet road under a blanket of stars made for a beautiful evening walk.
We really love this place and hope to stop again on our way back through in the spring."

Stayed a few nights","The area around this cabin is a real gem of a spot in the four corners area. It doesn’t get much attention, but there are lots of very quiet canyons and forests nearby, with deer, elk and abundant wildflowers. The cabin itself is at high elevation (over 7000’) so the climate is more like Flagstaff than Gallup, surrounded by pine trees and cool breezes. The cabin itself is cozy and spotlessly clean, filled with thoughtful touches - food, books, binoculars, games, firewood etc. The cell reception is very good (Verizon), so no Wi-Fi necessary. The nearby lake isn’t at it’s highest level these days, but adds to the lovely view still. We used the cabin as a base camp for exploring the Zuni mountains and day trips in the four corners region. We could have spent many more days and not run out of fun adventures. Not everything in the Zuni range is well documented, so local advice and a sense of adventure is helpful. Zero crowds, a huge plus for us."

Stayed with a pet","Had a great stay at Bruce's cabin. It is super cozy!
Bruce really puts a lot of effort into making this cabin a comfortable experience. There are so many things to enjoy here - from the fully stocked kitchen, sunporch with a beautiful view, fireplace, gas grill, campfire. All the details were taken care of. Even the outside campfire had wood in it, ready for use.
Just down the road (to the south) is the Cibola National forest, with a beautiful canyon hike.
There is only one issue that we had. This is the reason for my 4 stars instead of 5. I feel like I must mention this, to warn other travelers. The security on this cabin is very weak. There are at least 4 ground-level windows in the house that do not have any lock or locking mechanism.
Right next to the bed, there is a window with no lock. Anyone could very quietly slide that window open during the middle of the night.
It was really hard to sleep, knowing this. We woke up many times during the middle of the night.
I hope there will be a solution to this issue soon, for the safety of other travelers."

We got in late after a long day of driving on I-40. Cabin is easy to find and Bruce’s instructions are very easy to follow. It was snowing and quickly dropping in to the 20’s that night. Bruce already had the heat on for us and had even prebuilt the beginnings of a fire for us. The cabin is very clean and tidy plus, it really has everything you need. For me, it’s the small things - for starters, the fire. Furthermore, Bruce had stocked the fridge with the makings of breakfast for the morning just in case his guests don’t have provisions. Every amenity one could ask for, including games and books. We slept comfortably and warm, in the morning we awoke to a beautiful view of the valley the cabin overlooks. It’s an excellent stop in a convenient location."

We enjoyed sitting on the deck, watching the evening progress across the distant lake and hills, while a fascinating array of birds gathered at the feeders near the house. Lovely serenity. And Bruce was an exemplary host, very prompt with communication. Cabin was furnished with everything we needed and more."

Stayed one night","The reviews don’t lie! Bruce is an extremely accommodating host who clearly cares about providing his guests the best experience. From the breakfast foods in the fridge, to the fireplace all set and ready to light. The cabin itself is a beautiful design, all hand made many years ago. The screened in porch provides sweeping views of the lake and the mountains in the distance. There are many spots to explore on his property if you like to hike around. If you’re looking for a quiet spot surrounded by natural beauty to disconnect from the chaos of your every day than this is the place for you. Our only regret is that we weren’t able to stay longer. My husband and I very much look forward to returning again soon."

Stayed one night","I stayed here with my dog for an overnight as we made our way back to Texas. I wish we booked longer. Bruce’s home is very comfortable, the property is fun to explore, and the view of the lake is so beautiful. I didn’t even notice there wasn’t a TV until I was packing up. We spent most of the time sitting in the enclosed patio or walking the property. I’ll definitely rebook when I’m in the area again."

Stayed one night",Bruce was a great host. The cabin was lovely and we had spent most of the evening reading by the fire since it was raining. He showed us a great hiking spot for the next day when the weather cleared up. We’ll definitely be back.

Stayed a few nights","Awesome place if you want peace and quiet. No TV but enough cell service for calls/texts and doing a little work. Beautiful view and a peaceful neighborhood. Centrally located so we were able to visit the Bisti Wilderness, Chaco Canyon, El Morro and Malpais National Monuments and the Bandera Volcano and Ice Caves during our three-night stay. The host, Bruce, was very responsive and caring and made the stay even more pleasant. It is a quaint cabin so don’t expect a bunch of luxuries but it had everything we needed for a comfortable and relaxing stay."

Stayed a few nights","This destination was so wonderful. We needed to get away from the city and this was it. It’s a cabin in the woods at the end of a road. But there is EVERYTHING.
The kitchen is stocked to be able to cook. Pans, crockpot, outdoor grill., basic spices.
We stopped to shop in Grants for food and that was all we had to add. Bruce has it all hooked up from fire pit to fire place.
Books, bed, shower essentials, space to lounge and room for the dog to run.
Cell service is there if you need it but if you want WiFi and TV, keep looking. That was what charmed us. Some disconnect.
And if you need any ends once you’re there, the drive to Thoreau is fast and the Dollar General/Family Dollar have stuff.
Thank you Bruce"

Stayed one night","Nice cozy cabin with beautiful lake views from the covered patio with big windows that open up to let the breeze in. Small kitchen but well stocked, made multiple gourmet meals without difficulty.
Easy access to the state park. Only disappointment was that the water wasn’t that nice, but that may have been partly due to the area we were in.
House was great, already sent the info to my friend who likes to standup paddle board"

Bruce set the cabin up to be comfortable and fun: well-equipped kitchen and outdoor BBQ, nice supply of food staples and munchies, fireplace, and comfy bed. Cell phone connections were good, so we could do email and internet using a cell phone hotspot. Great views from the cabin and good access to nearby hikes and sites to view spectacular rock formations and lava fields. Bruce even advised us on what to visit and road conditions. We would give Bruce and his cabin an A+."

Stayed one night","This location is absolutely beautiful!! the enclosed patio has large screens under some of the windows which made for a gorgeous view of bluewater lake and the monsoon storm we caught. Cabin is in great condition and has beautiful history spread throughout. Bruce is an extremely friendly host who communicatets quickly about any questions and gave us some great fishing tips! he also shared a bit of history on the cabin.
large property line to walk dogs. but watch curious dogs around cactus!
The bed is absolutely amazing!
Perfect secluded cabin with amazing views, you will not regret this stay!"

My mother loved every bit, and she’s not easy to please. The rooms were spacious, comfortable couches, and nice and quiet neighborhood.

Stayed a few nights","Gallup was the perfect spot for us to meet up with our friends from WA state. We selected Marcie's place because of the expansive space. It was also conveniently located to some nearby sites we planned on visiting, namely Chaco Canyon and El Morro National Monument. We cooked several meals at Marcie's, and it was nice to have an operable kitchen. The house worked perfectly for us."

Stayed with kids","The house was a comfortable and worked well for our 2 night stay. There was plenty of space, in fact much more than our family of 4 could even use.
We didn’t try to cook, but the kitchen worked well for us to reheat our leftovers from dinner for breakfast.
The location is a nice quiet neighborhood, about 5-10 min drive from the center of town, and as a runner I enjoyed a morning run through the nearby trails with great views of the surrounding landscape."

Quiet and safe neighborhood, 10 minutes far from work proyect, and got everything we needed in this house…
I really recommend this Bnb and Marcie was always there for us.
We stayed for 3 weeks in total."

Stayed a few nights","We were visiting relatives in the area and this place was a great option for us. it is flexible with bunk beds in one room and a king bed in the other. There were likely options with the living room couches but we didn't explore that.
The house is nicely decorated, has all the amenities you need for a short stay, and it's set apart from other houses so it feels very private.
The WiFi at the house was reliable and fast enough for me to work. However, my cell signal in the area was non existent. It's important to look up the address and directions to the place before you get there!!"

A great location for exploring El Malpias, El Morro, and Bandera Ice Caves. The house was well stocked, clean, and quiet. It had everything we needed for a very comfortable stay. The swamp cooler which was wonderful. Made for very comfortable sleeping during hot summer nights. Great for star gazing as well. Highly recommend. A great alternative to staying in Gallup or Grants. Plus Whitney was a great host! She was very attentive but also gave us plenty of privacy. Definitely will be staying here again."
