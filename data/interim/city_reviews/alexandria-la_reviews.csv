Stayed with a pet",Barrett’s apartment was comfy and cute! It was close to the freeway and in a walkable neighborhood with my pup. The bed was super comfortable and Barrett was very responsive. We stayed just one night on a road trip but we’d definitely stay again.

Stayed with a pet","Great little place! I only spent one night here during a road trip, but I will add it to my list for longer stays. The neighborhood was very quiet and peaceful (with friendly neighborhood cats!) and with easy access to the interstate. The unit was comfortable and cozy and made great use of a smaller space. The bed was incredibly comfortable, too! I don't usually sleep well in unfamiliar places but the sheets were so soft and the pillows so fluffy, I fell asleep immediately and slept well. Priceless after a long day on the road. Definitely recommend for an affordable stay in Alexandria!"

Stayed one night","The small apartment was adequate for our needs. We appreciated the way ￼Barrett responded quickly to our request for information and went the extra mile for us to do what we needed to do for our grandchildren. It’s not easy to meet the needs of special needs grandchildren, but Garrett helped make it do-able. Clean place, safe place to spend the night, with a nice tv, bed, bathroom, and kitchenette."

Stayed with kids",I loved how nice and clean Barrett’s property was. The furniture and appliances were well placed as well. Having a toddler I ALWAYS notice outlets and always bring extra outlet covers to ensure my child’s safety and was impressed that I only had to cover 2 electrical outlets because of how well everything was placed. The barn doors were adorable and I immediately felt at ease. I REALLY liked that there were not many breakables placed around too. Very family friendly home. We will return.

Check in was a breeze.
It is in a good location, wasn’t too far off the interstate. I felt safe here.
The only thing I did not like was the door that separated the bathroom from the kitchen. It was a flimsy plastic folding door. It did not shut well.
I would stay again!"

Stayed with kids","My husband and I along with our 19-month-old daughter stayed here for a night on our way to Mississippi from Texas. It was perfect for what we needed! Barrett provided a pack n play and a high chair for our daughter, and it was great that we could have our daughter sleep in the bedroom and we could close the door and stay up later in the living room. We ended up sleeping on the pull-out couch just to avoid the risk of waking our daughter by going into the bedroom, so it was great having that option! Our daughter also loved the gumball machine!
Overall, it was a great stay, and we look forward to staying there again on our way back home!"

Stayed with kids","The apartment was very clean and cute BUT the bed was terribly uncomfortable and there were plastic coverings on the mattresses which I understand for cleanliness but it was so noisy and HOT. I'm always cold and I ended up putting the air as low as possible to make up for the plastic sheet under me that was generating sound and heat like you wouldn't believe. None of us slept. Also the gumball machine requires quarters so if you have children, be warned."

Stayed over a week",Larry & Michelle place was absolutely beautiful 😍. I felt right at home the moment I walked in. I enjoyed the peacefulness of this home. The house is beautifully decorated and I absolutely loved the porches and enjoyed just sitting outside and enjoying the sunshine. This house felt like my home away from home. And Larry and Michelle made me feel so special while staying here. The pound cake was so amazingly delicious I think I ate half of it by myself lol. For Mother’s Day I was presented with home made treats and flowers 💐. Which was so unexpected and but greatly appreciated. Let me just say the cheesecake treat is to die for. If you’re looking for a peaceful and beautiful home to stay in while visiting Alexandria you want go wrong staying here. Larry and Michelle was an absolute pleasure to work with and talk to. They will make sure that you have everything you need to enjoy this beautiful home. When I come back to visit I will definitely be staying here again. God bless you all!

Stayed a few nights","What a perfect location for a couple of country folks. The house is located close to the airport and good restaurants along MaCarthur Dr., at the same time it is hidden along a quiet country road. The hosts were mindful answering a few questions and they checked in a couple times to make sure we were comfortable. The house was extremely clean, neat and well supplied. We considered a hotel but for just a few dollars more you can have a whole house instead of a large room. Also, I am not a cake eater, but the cake they supplied was delicious! When we visit friends in Alexandria, we will center our travel around the availability of Compass Point."

Stayed a few nights",WOW!! The Compass Point Cottage is absolutely AMAZING! I have stayed at many AIRBNB's and Larry & Michelle's place was by far the best place we have ever stayed at. They are the most incredible hosts. The house was beautifully decorated and feeling of home hits you immediately. Then there is the homemade pound cake they made for us that was waiting for us when we arrived. Truly the most comfortable and welcoming home away from home. I highly recommend their place to anyone who is looking for a place in the Alexandria area. The location is perfect. Country setting but just minutes from the main highway in Alexandria with many restaurants and shopping places.

Recommendations were given for local restaurants and activities which were so helpful and appreciated. Larry was quick to respond to our messages, and he checked in to make sure all was going well and we had everything we needed. We definitely recommend Compass Point Cottage!"

Upon arrival, I was immediately impressed by the cleanliness. The home is beautifully decorated, well-maintained and equipped with everything needed for a comfortable stay. The hosts put a lot of thought into creating a welcoming and cozy environment. What truly set this Airbnb stay apart was the host's exceptional hospitality. Larry and Michelle went above and beyond to ensure my stay was memorable. From being welcomed with a cream cheese pound cake complete with strawberry topping and whip cream in the fridge to the hosts remaining accessible and attentive, they truly made me feel like a valued guest. They have set the bar incredibly high for future Airbnb stays. Five stars does not do them justice."

This is the best Airbnb I have stayed at and have shared this with those in the Alexandria area and those interested in going there!! I am somewhat reluctant to say that because I don't want to lose the option to stay here in the future by having others book it :).
Don't miss this gem and the chance to wake up to a beautiful sunrise."

From the handwritten notes to the cream cheese cake and strawberries left for me and my family to enjoy, everything was perfect. The space is clean, private, quiet, peaceful, meticulously maintained and very cozy. The location is peaceful yet convenient. You can see the stars so brilliantly at night from their property, even see a horse trotting down the road... yet you're close to all the conveniences you need. I highly recommend to anyone looking for a weekend getaway or a longer stay - you won't be disappointed."

We tend to do a lot of cooking when staying at air bnbs and found it a little difficult with the supplies on hand. Hope to visit again soon.

Staying here you will feel right at home, because this isn’t room sharing. It’s like having your own home. Friendly neighbors are always a plus
When you come in you will always find a handwritten note from the host. Giving you crucial information as well as their contact number. While welcoming you to Alexandria
This place has more than enough space that I need..it’s always just me when I visit but I can see how I can comfortably add more people & not feel like we are on top one another.
Location, Location, Location. This stay is located near a main road in Alexandria. So traveling is breeze. Also a one minute drive to a shopping complex
Perfect for someone visiting
I don’t want to forget the kitchen has everything you would need to cook if you prefer your own cooking. Pots Pans Toaster and more…Already Provided.
Stayed Here Many Times

Group trip","We booked this place last minute when inclement weather affected our other plans.Sharnael & Bethany were quick to respond & were clear in their instructions for the house. However, having booked many other much busier locations, we were surprised at the lack of flexibility with check-in time.
The house was clean and as described on AirBnB but scantily furnished compared to the FB listing. It appears rather neglected outside (overgrown & dead landscaping around the house) but inside was well maintained.
It’s a beautiful & spacious house with a well stocked kitchen.
Important to note, however, that all the beds but one had thin very uncomfortable mattresses. The downstairs “office”/extra bedroom had no lamps or side tables so if you use the sleeper sofa it’s either full overhead lights or nothing. Same for the living room.
Overall, under the circumstances & the time of year, this property worked for us in a pinch.The beautiful lake views would definitely make a summer visit worth it."

Stayed a few nights",The house was great for our family gathering. The back porch is always in the shade with a nice breeze. Two bath towels per bathroom is not enough for two people. We loved the kitchen. A TV outside would be a great extra! Will definitely stay here again.

Group trip",We loved how large this house was for our large cousin gathering. We are cousins who wanted to reconnect with where our parents grew up. The house was open and had enough room to accommodate us easily. The river was beautiful and we enjoyed the porch. The only problem was the heat and that wasn’t anyone’s fault but Mother Nature! We talked about using this home again in a couple of years for the same thing.

The breaker tripped in one of the rooms that controlled the hot water heater, but once we figured that out (our host did very well with keeping in communication) we were fine. Only one of us took a cold shower😁As I read on another review, make sure to get your snacks or anything you need beforehand as it is a little ways out. Beautiful spacious home!!!"

Stayed with kids",Amazing lake view! The house is somewhat difficult to find and food/amenities are in short supply once you're there so be sure to pack for your meals. The kitchen is fantastic though: well stocked with cooking supplies and certainly spacious enough to cook for the masses. The porches are phenomenal--wrapping around the entire house and overlooking the gorgeous lake--but you might want to bring additional folding chairs to enjoy. The charcoal grill was great for outdoor cooking.

Group trip","The Oxbow Retreat was truly a retreat! Amy, was very easy to communicate with prior to checking in, during our stay, and upon check out. The home is exactly as the pictures show. The kitchen is a chef’s dream! The cooks in our group loved how large it was to have someone cooking and someone cleaning dishes while others could pass through without ever getting into each other’s way. The openness of the living room, kitchen, and dining was large enough to accommodate our guests comfortably without ever feeling crowded. Each bedroom had an en suite bath, this was a plus for our group!
The boat dock and launch were a nice feature. We enjoyed several kayak adventures during our stay. Although the weather did not cooperate with all of our planned activities, the massive wrap around porch and open living kept us dry while still being able to enjoy corn hole and yard Jenga. We are looking forward to our next stay at The Oxbow Retreat!"

Place as described, very large shower detailed instructions & a very nice ""welcome letter"" posted in kitchenette. Asked for any & all suggestions or critiques for improving his place for future guests.I ran into bad weather at the vendor event I was in area for .He answered late texts & understood that I'd be very late due damage to my tent & packing up at event .Gave me extra instructions on parking in drive& area as he knew from my texts I was a bit overwhelmed from damage to our set up. His entire block is lit up blue with porch lights & is either a law enforcement supporting neighborhood or all owned by law enforcement which was comforting as I'm also a retired officer & felt my vehicle full of my art and fixtures in an open bed pick up was safe & sound . I have shared his info on several of my artist & law enforcement social media pages and given him an extensive recommendation Thanks again! D"

Being that I’m going through a bad domestic situation. This place was really like a second home to me. I appreciate the fact that I was given an opportunity to stay here. If in the future, I am ever in need of a place to stay. This definitely will be by far my top choice. This definitely had all the bills and whistles that I was looking for which made for great stay."

Found this tiny home listing on air bnb and all the reviews were great! After staying there I know why, it’s exactly as it’s pictured in the add and described perfectly it’s quaint and subtle and comfortable. It’s perfect for somebody traveling for work by themselves or for a couple looking for something small to stay in and have privacy that hotels don’t have, and the price is very affordable and you get way more than you pay for with this place from all the amenities that are offered and the comfort of this little home. William was a great host and any questions I had responded very quickly and told me any issues I had or anything I needed to don’t hesitate to message him. Will definitely stay here again when I’m in the area!"

Stayed with kids","Absolutely loved this place!! Clean, homie feel, located in a very quiet, nice neighborhood where we felt very comfortable!! We were staying for my daughters softball tournament & originally had booked a hotel room for the same price as what we paid for Rory’s place. So when we found Rory’s for same price but bigger, nicer, homie vibes plus a kitchen to cook instead of take out, I knew we had to cancel hotel immediately and stay here! So happy we did &if we are ever in the area again and Rory’s is available we will without a doubt be staying here! Everything you need plus more. Also would like to add that the day of check-out we needed an extra hour so instead of check out @11 we requested 12. Rory was very friendly and let us without a problem! This was extremely helpful to us & we are thankful for such a nice stay with nice, helpful, friendly host! Easy check-in, nice home, quiet neighborhood, &friendly, helpful host! Stay@Rory’s you will NOT be disappointed!! Home away from home🫶🏼👌🏼👏🏼"

The cons: There were some amenities shown on the listing that weren't actually provided (i.e. , body wash) as well as some amenities that weren't listed that I think should be provided (i.e., paper towels). I will mention more of these items to Mickel privately.
I would highly recommend this place if you need a sweet home away from home.😊 I believe any necessary changes will be made to make this airbnb stand out even more!"

Group trip","Chloe's place was exactly as described and very accurate to the pictures. While the trip was not a pleasure trip it was very near a loved one in the hospital. This place ia definitely on my rebook list when back home.
Chloe was very accommodating when i needed to extend my stay by 1 day which was really appreciated.
Thank you Chloe for allowing my family in your home."

Stayed for a week+ for our granddaughter’s HS graduation. The property is absolutely beautiful—welcoming, super clean and comfortable. Well stocked—multiple sets of linen/towels—more than enough soaps etc…every type of cleaning supply you can imagine. Check in was a breeze and Beth was always available if needed…we had multiple changes in plans and Beth was more than accommodating and helpful.
For a weekend/a week or longer if in the area this should be your ‘go to place’—you won’t be disappointed. Am what some consider a hard grader—this is truly a 5+.
Thanks so much for a great week….

Stayed with kids","Beth’s place is a sweet little cottage that has been renovated with nice finishes and is decorated with lovely art and comfy furniture. The location is truly convenient to everything, including the Interstate. That said, it’s by no means in a “bad” neighborhood but it’s certainly not in a great one so the security system added some peace of mind. Beth was friendly and responsive whenever we had a question or problem (small issue with the Wi-Fi, quickly resolved), and her checkout procedures (i.e. stripping beds, emptying trash, etc.) are pretty minimal compared to other Airbnbs that I’ve stayed in. It does only have one bathroom so if you travel with teenage girls like I do, this can be a challenge. Overall, we had a nice stay."

Group trip","Beth’s little BNB was fantastic! The neighborhood is charming, well lit and safe. The house has a security system and keyless entry as well. We were attending an event at the Coliseum, and it only took about 10 mins with a little traffic.
The old wooden doors and floors are beautiful. She stocked us up with plenty of toilet paper, towels, tissues, hand soaps etc for our group of 5. The bathroom had soap, shampoo and conditioner in case you forgot them. She had hangers and extra blankets and pillows. I slept in the master bedroom. The bed is AMAZINGLY comfortable. Seriously, I slept like a rock. The kitchen has been updated and was great for cooking up breakfast and brunch. Plenty of cookware and dishes. The gas stove is awesome. If you plan on cooking, bring a cutting board. We found one, but it was very tiny.
The bathroom is roomy, but has the only mirror in the house. If your traveling with several girls like I did, bring another one 😹
Beth kept in touch during our stay and is super hospitable. I definitely recommend her place! We had such a great time!"

Stayed with kids","The master bed was comfy. The kitchen was beautiful, although it lacked a few key things if you plan to actually cook. The house was very charming. BRING HOUSE SHOES if you’re staying during cold weather as the floors were freezing due to the elevated state. The heating, though uneven worked great if all doors were left open. The bathtub did look sketchy. Krud Kutter or magic erasers would probably clean it deeply the way it needed. My family sneezed the entirety of the stay possibly due to the filthy vents and ceiling fans. The trash drawer also had food from previous stays in the bottom. Although gross, I could see how this might be an oversight. I asked for a late checkout, and it was unavailable (understandable). However, we were still loading the luggage that had been moved to the porch when the cleaners arrived. We were completely off site by 11:15, but still asked to pay the $50 late fee. So, there is no mercy there. Pack up & get out on time to avoid that. Overall, we did enjoy the cottage."

Stayed a few nights","The Cottage home offered me the kind of warm and cozy home I was looking for on my retreat. I found the space to be very relaxing and I loved the personal touches throughout the cottage. The kitchen was probably my favorite place in the cottage as it is so bright and inviting and well stocked with coffee, creamer, sugar, and spices, although some water bottles or small cereal bars or snacks would have been appreciated for extended stays. I wasn’t a huge fan of the jazz decor, but I was glad the space was decorated and not just plain or empty feeling. The bed, pillows and linens were very comfortable. The shower was hot, there’s a tub, but it’s shower only, so I couldn’t soak and relax in the tub as I hoped to. I couldn’t figure how to cut the living room tv on regular or how to cut on the ceiling fans as there are multiple remotes and buttons to figure out. The wifi works pretty good, it just doesn’t work in the backyard, but it’s better on the front porch. I enjoyed my cup of coffee on the front porch each morning. I had an extended stay and had more peace of mind with the alarm. I did great setting it and arming and disarming it, all but once, and it went off loudly, until I could figure how to reset it. The neighbor was friendly, but some neighbors played loud music and worked on cars, houses and yard work which was noisy. The neighborhood is okay, but assuming Garden District, I presumed it would be somewhat better. The street had a mix of people, some friendly, some loud and off putting and a couple streets over is dilapidated houses and not the best areas as I seen when venturing out to the store. The house was overall clean, but the fridge, floors, microwave and tub could’ve been cleaner. It was comfortable and clean, just not quite sparkly. At checkout there is a list to follow, so linens stripped, dishes washed, garbage taken out, thermostat and alarm to set. I checked out a day early and headed home on the last evening after a four day stay. I miss already the coziness and peacefulness of the cottage, it felt like my home away from home. I would stay here again on my next stays in the area, because the cottage is warm and cozy and the hostess is really sweet and friendly."

I enjoyed the neighborhood as it oferred an appreciation of the great diversity of life styles and a reflection of the world around us.  The homes that did stand out in their historic glamour were so beautiful and fun to see.
The cottage did have so many extras that afforded you with day-to-day conveniences that were very much appreciated.  Having a back yard was very nice and a lovely porch to relax on in the evenings was a plus.  
I would recommend Beth's cottage to you for all these reasons and then some."

Its beautifully remodeled, the décor is nice, and the location if you know what streets to drive down is also good. Its close to Target and Walmart. Quite street with nice beautiful homes. There is plenty of parking but keep in mind you share a driveway so must stay to one side but there is plenty of space for that. Back to the cottage...The kitchen is beautiful and well stocked. They have noise machines you can use in each bedroom. The bathroom is spacious and was easy for us to share. Check in and check out was easy and not complicated. Beth is very kind and easy to communicate with throughout. We plan to use Beth's Cottage for our stays again in the future. Thanks for such a beautiful place!"

Stayed with kids","We GREATLY enjoyed our stay at House on Hill. I loved the older house and found the small vintage touches (books, notes, photos) really neat. I thought the pic of the house in the 20s/30s in the kitchen was very cool. My 18 month old loved playing in the spacious, fenced in back yard and I felt at ease letting her play. Justine had even thought about the needs of her guests and placed eye masks and ear plugs in the drawers to accommodate guests. I definitely used the eye mask, but did not need the ear plugs; little details like this make me appreciate the host and their home that much more. We encountered a small issue while there and let Justine and Kenneth know about it (before bed) and it was taken care of immediately the next morning with no disturbance or hindrance to us during our time there. Will DEFINITELY stay again on our next visit. Lovely home, peaceful environment, felt safe, and my little had a blast (thanks for having games)."

The back porch is perfect to drink coffee and watch the sun rise. I feel in love with this place a year ago and love coming back. If you want peace, quite and comfort, this is the place for you."

The beds were uncomfortable as well as the pull out couch.
I only ended up staying one night and leaving the next day because no one wanted to stay do to the beds and the bugs
So I lost out on one whole day of my stay
And was not compensated for only staying one night.
Will never stay there again."

Connie also was sweet enough to accommodate us checking out a little late and it was greatly appreciated!! Would definitely stay here again!

Stayed a few nights","The apartment is a duplex, behind an apartment complex. The area is quiet. It is nicely decorated with a beachy feel. There are several restaurants near by. The neighbor smokes and the funny smelling smoke fills the rental often. Connie apologized and is aware of the neighbor's habit and offered additional air freshener. The wall is thin between the duplex, as we could hear the neighbor's TV, microwave, and he and his guests talking.
When we arrived the bathroom was not clean, tub had hairs in it, wash clothes had long hairs in them, the hand towels were stained, there was food particles in the kitchen sink and the dishes had not been put away. The issue was resolved while we were out for the evening. We did request for all towels/wash clothes to be swapped out and for additional towels as there were only 3 for our 4 night stay and were advised there are ONLY 4 towels for the unit, but that they had been freshly laundered while we were out. We went to Walmart and bought our own. Bring extra toilet tissue so you don't run out at 11pm like we did, ;0) as there is only the 1 roll provided. The king bedroom has a door to the outside with built in blinds, no curtain, for those like myself who are light sensitive. Despite the welcome book stating there were additional linens in the master closet there were none. The large box of half&half was 6 months past it's best by date and upon notification she replaced it that afternoon with creamer.
Connie responded to my messages in an hour and did provide a refund of the cleaning fee and the first night's rent since the apartment was not ready when we checked in. She did allow us to check in at 2. She suggested the bathroom had been overlooked and that the turn around was a little tight because of our early check in, but that that wasn't an excuse for it."

We asked for a deadbolt key to for more security one weekend we were out of town and she provided us the key the same day. The location does look a bit sketchy, but it was in fact extremely quiet and pleasant during our stay. 5 stars on communication."

If someone was walking on the other side of the house or talking we could hear it. That is my only compliant is that i wish i had known that when booking. Besides that the stay was great, perfect place to just rest our heads for the night. Everything was clean, Barret was very responsive. I think this place is a great stay for one night or two, if youre just passing through. There was also a mother cat outside our window, we didnt mind her and when we reported it to Barret, he said he would check on her and that meant a lot to us. We still think about the momma cat."

I had a few questions prior to our arrival, messaged Barrett, & he responded quickly & helpfully. Check-in was a smooth process, and we had no issues during our short stay with anything except getting in and out the driveway (which Barrett did forewarn us about). Check out was as smooth as check-in, so no complaints about that either. If we are ever back in the area, we would totally try to stay again; however, we would bring a higher riding vehicle for getting in and out the drive."

One thing we are always concerned about when we travel is the bed, and my husband and I both loved how soft and comfortable the bed was. We also loved the nostalgic touches of a video game machine and the large gum ball machine along with a very varied selection of reading materials.
We experienced a small issue with the shower hot water due to very low temperatures in the area (very abnormal for this area), and while it was absolutely no fault of Barrett’s, when we reached out to him about the issue, he responded immediately and moved us to a different unit. We also had the pleasure of talking with Barrett during our stay, and not only were we impressed with what a great host he is, we were also impressed with his character. We are already planning to stay here again our next trip!"

Stayed with a pet","Barrett was very friendly and responsive. The check in and out was easy and convenient. The actual apartment was extremely clean with lots of windows to look out onto a Garden District backyard with lots of trees and nature. However, the apartment is on a neighborhood street behind a house so you get the city and country feel at the same time. It is very centrally located to Jackson Street and many popular restaurants etc., I love that he allows pets and was very understanding when my accident prone kitten got herself stuck somewhere she wasn’t supposed to be. All was well!
Oh.. and a comfortable bed, sofa, huge Tv and a washing machine and dryer should you need it…. Everything you need at an affordable and reasonable price!"

Our host seemed conscientious - was responsive and friendly."

Stayed with a pet","Barrett's place was perfect for me. The area felt safe. It is small but can easily accommodate a couple or a person traveling alone. He gave step by step instructions on how parts of the home operate. The home was clean and well-appointed with dryer, toiletries and even detergent for the washer. I had some cold weather and the heating in the house is supplied by the all in one air conditioning units. There were portable heaters which were great for getting immediate heat and then of course shut off for the night. The bed was comfortable. This is a big deal to me as I have trouble sleeping. I loved the parking area as you can park right in front of the door to unload. One thing to note is that there are three stairs to get into the house with no railing. This only matters if you have mobility issues . It is in no way unsafe but just a notation. The shower was nice and hot with great pressure. It's an older home so the bathroom sinks water needs a little time to heat up. Loved my stay."

Stayed with kids","Everything was very clean. Chips and water were available upon check-in. New modern appliances, older building. Great value.
The host was great with communication and instructions.
I do want to point out that the bed is on a very low platform. I'm 5'4"" and the top of the mattress was under my knee if I stood next to it. It was leg day at the gym earlier that day and it was a little difficult for me to get up and down. If you have bad knees, weak legs, etc., this could potentially be an issue.
Older neighborhood but seemed safe and it was very quiet. Conveniently located to the highway and Louisiana College.
Thanks so much!"

Stayed a few nights","From Start Barrett was the perfect host we arrived early in town. I text him at about maybe two 3 o’clock am the morning . Wait d for response when he woke up allowed us to check in at 8 AM he allowed he also allowed me to stay a little bit late because we did wake up a little off time which was wonderful Barrett had everything you need to cook. We did a seafood boil. We cooked breakfast daily air air conditioners were wonderful three and a entire home kitchen living room bedroom per Louisiana Alexandria you would need that very responsive when I sent him a text message asking for a combination for the lock that had the extra tissue and paper towels, which was very appreciated, very quiet we slept there majority of the time but we’re gone during the day in either daylight or evening. It was very peaceful and next time I stay, I may try to do a little small barbecue with my small family in the backyard because it’s very spacious parking was amazing. Lights were very lit outside for us towels wonderful set of towels had extra already set up clean washer and dryer refrigerator. got everything code froze to the right temperature. overall Barrett was an amazing host and for me not being from Louisiana but I used to live here a year ago being able to come back and be comfortable in a home was wonderful. There is no bugs, not even walking in and having the flying a little flies around porch light. It was wonderful amazing experience especially knowing when Alexandria u could come to town and have to stay with family or a hotel this is a gem don’t pass it up."

Plus some soaps and lotions! In the closet there are fans & heaters! And I like that the door has a pin code. It really is a nice fun little space! We mentioned the water pressure seemed low to us at the end of our stay, and he was quick to check it and let us know he noticed it as well and was going to fix it! He messaged us to see if he could mow the back yard! He was very thoughtful and we appreciated that!! Before we booked he was quick about answering questions about the WiFi because my husband works from home and we just needed to know it was with a decent trustworthy service provider & it had a solid connect (which it did). Overall, when we’re back in Louisiana we will stay with Barrett! And we recommend this space to anyone looking! It’s worth it!"

Upon checking in the key pad was sticking a little bit making it hard to punch in the entry code but it was definitely because it was a very humid wet evening because the rest of the time there it did not do that. She called and apologized for the inconveniene right away when I sent her a message. On our second to last day we ran out of toilet paper and paper towels which she dropped off more for us very fast which was super nice. I would book again if we come back to this area definitely!

The host was so great and proactive - promptly replied to every message and addressed our questions. She went above and beyond to make sure we felt welcome. We had some difficulties on our drive-in and were arriving later than expected. Mary made a Walmart run to ensure we had food to eat upon our arrival.

As for my companions traveling with me, they had an issue with the shortage of outlets in the rooms and one of the outlets was “touchy” and didn’t always want to charge her device. The other complaint was how easy it was to hear everything in the house. I grew up in an old home and so none of this bothered me, but that was their chief complaint. I enjoyed my stay overall, the short time each day I had in it. I would definitely recommend this place to rent for events in the area. Thank you for such a stress-free experience and making the work we had to do possible."

Linda was incredibly responsive to my messages. Overall, I had a fantastic stay in Linda's home and would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Alexandria. The location was perfect and the space was comfortable and inviting. Thank you, Linda for making my trip to Alexandria so memorable. I hope to stay at your home again in the future!"

Stayed a few nights",ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! Linda is super sweet! She met me outside after a long night of work with a big hug that was much needed. The home & room is super clean & cool & she even provides fans if you like to be extra cool like myself. The bed is so comfortable & the room is dark which is great after working a night shift. Now let’s talk about the food. Linda makes the absolute BEST blueberry pancakes I ever had & she makes sure you get full. I’m so looking forward to my next stay.

But the real gift of Linda, is not just her clean and cozy home but her generosity of spirit. She not only feeds you a wonderful meal, but she feeds your spirit as well. It's the Linda's of the world who make me want to keep using Airbnb. (For the weary of heart, I especially recommend a stay with Linda!)"

Stayed over a week","During my assignment as a travel nurse, I had the opportunity to stay at Linda's place. I always felt safe and secure when I was there. She and her husband Paul are wonderful hosts. Linda is a great cook, and Paul is a talented musician. They considered me a family member. Besides delicious dinners I got every night, I received plenty more from them, whether it be some extra blankets, useful advice, or an extra hand when needed.
When my car was totaled because of the flood, Linda drove me to places, such as grocery store and the airport. She also showed me how to crack pecans and gave me some to take home as a gift. Paul let me use his computer to work on some modules for my assignment. They also found ways to entertain their guests, such as playing spinner, coming to Paul's performance, and playing frisbee at the park. I am thankful to have found their place and I recommend everyone to try it if you have a chance to visit Alexandria."

Stayed a few nights","I went to Linda's splace as I didn't want to say alone in a hotel this week, and I found a marvellous place. It's big, very clean, and you also get to enjoy her delicious dishes, and nice conversations. You are also welcome to pet the cat when it's around, and meet other very interesting guests if there are. I can only recommand this place, as a place of heaven in this nice neighboorhood!"

Stayed one night",Once again my travels had me staying at Ms. Linda's. And one again I felt like family in her clean and inviting home. I noticed new carpet and paint in the room. Also being close to town the neighborhood is very quiet which yields a nice peaceful nights sleep. I've tried other homes in the area and none come close to hers.

Stayed over a week","What a wonderful person Ms. Linda is! This was my second stay at her lovely home, and she welcomed me back as though I were family. Ms. Linda keeps an immaculate home, and is a superb chef. Before writing this review, I re-read her listing, and can verify it to be accurate. If anything, she understates the warmth and comfort her listing offers. Ms. Linda regularly went out of her way to accommodate my hectic work schedule, which had to have been an imposition on her. But I would never know it. She handled me and my drama with the utmost grace and compassion. I have developed a true affection for Ms. Linda, and highly recommend her to anyone looking for a safe haven in Alexandria."

Stayed over a week","Staying at Linda’s guest house was like staying with family. She went above and beyond with being an amazing and attentive host, while still completely respecting personal space and privacy. I hope to have an opportunity to stay with her in the future. Linda has a true gift for hospitality and knows how to spoil her guests. She started with excellent communication prior to booking, and with her providing detailed directions to her home.



Her greeting was the warmest of welcomes. The home was lovely, and the room was perfect. She is fully equipped with everything you could possibly need. The bed was comfortable; the shower was like a spa; the space was inviting and cozy; and she allowed the use of her washer and dryer. She allowed the freedom to be private, but also offered her company, as well as that of her most delightful group of friends. Linda is one of the sweetest people anyone could hope to meet. She was friendly, generous, and really interesting to talk with. Moreover, she is a phenomenal chef – what delicious food she prepares and offers!!! Truly a refreshing stay that is most highly recommend.



Merci pour tout!"

Stayed over a week","My recent stay with Ms. Linda was great. She took me in like I was family. Her cooking was great and she keeps a very clean house. My sons came over and ate dinner a few nights also and she also allowed them to help her put up and decorate her Christmas tree. I would recommend Ms. Linda to anyone who would like to experience true southern hospitality. Thanks for everything you did for my two boys and myself, Brock"

Stayed one night","Mrs. Linda was so kind and accommodating! I was driving through Alexandria on my way from Mississippi to Houston. I hadn't slept well the night before my trip and was in desperate need of a place to stop for a few hours to rest. I contacted Mrs. Linda, and asked if I might be able to stop in for about two to three hours in order to nap, and she immediately responded ""yes!""
This was my first Airbnb experience, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but everything was fantastic: clean home, southern hospitality, and plenty of snacks and food!
Mrs. Linda had a sweet little welcome basket filled with plenty of goodies and the nicest card in it, stating ""you're family now."" She even called me later in the evening to make sure I was home safe with hurricane Patricia making her mark on Texas. This is above and beyond. She genuinely cares about people, and it shows in all of her thoughtfulness. Can't recommend her enough.
The bed was comfy, the room was quiet and well cooled, and the black out curtains worked great as I arrived at 11 a.m. for my nap.
Thank you for your hospitality, Mrs. Linda!"

Stayed one night","This was a great evening. Linda made my feel very welcome and even had a goody bag ready for me with a very warm and friendly note. The home was in great condition, meticulously clean, and in a very good location. I had a TV in my room and WiFi throughout the home. I am a business traveler and had much work to do and this home was very convenient. Also, bathtub has been replaced with a huge shower with great water pressure--probably the best shower I have had in a year."

Stayed a few nights","Now I know firsthand why Linda has such glowing reviews!!! What a wonderful hostess, and she immediately made me feel welcome and a part of her home. From the generous offer of a ride from the airport after my rental car reservation snafu to the delicious welcome basket of sweets and pecans waiting for me in my room, it is obvious that Linda puts the comfort of her guests to the top of the list. I would definitely recommend staying here if your central Louisiana travels put you near Alexandria for the night."

Stayed a few nights","Linda was the perfect host and if your looking for down home warmth and care, you'll find it here. She loves to cook for you and has a very caring nature. The house is located in a convenient spot to get around Alexandria. This listing is just like staying with a friend or family. Heartwarming! the WiFi was great and the neighborhood had kids riding bikes and playing outside which I haven't really seen anywhere for awhile."
