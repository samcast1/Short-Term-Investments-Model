Stayed with kids",My family and I loved our stay at Olivia's place. The home was just as described/seen in the pictures with a few extra necessities if you left something at home. It was nice and clean and in close proximity to family and town. We enjoyed all the comforts of home and the peaceful setting. Communication was great. Olivia was very informative and quick to reply. We would definitely stay here again in the future.

The host made sure that our stay was all we expected by the clear amenities listed and quick communication.

The location is perfect especially if you are visiting Fort Polk/Fort Johnson. The home is absolutely beautiful, very clean and clutter free. I honestly didn’t want to leave and am sad to go.

I honestly feel like I’m going back home even though I’m on my way back to stay at this Airbnb. I cannot say enough good things about this place and Tina. Absolutely amazing!!

Group trip","My experience, dealing with the host, Kenneth, was unpleasant to say the least. Regarding the property, when the hosts say that what makes this property unique, is its “simplicity,” what it appears they mean is that it is minimalistic; everything about the property is bare minimum. Based on my experience, I would not recommend either this property or these hosts.
In my opinion Kenneth acted completely unprofessional, and his behavior caused me and my family to incur significant expense and inconvenience. I would not recommend that anyone take the risk of staying at a property hosted by Kenneth."

Stayed over a week","The place is great for the price. Had everything we needed including dozens of friendly dogs that come right up to the backdoor. My crew and I would not stay again but i wouldn't sway anyone from staying here.
In order to provide an honest review i must mention my crew and I felt unwelcome in the neighborhood because the host's ""house rules"" state the neighbors are likely not okay with the house being an airbnb. Then when we were unable to sleep due to several loud dogs barking after 10pm, the host requested we checkout the next day as her resolution. We barked back at the dogs to ""shut up"" because we heard other people doing the same, and the host implied we were ""yelling at the neighbors"". The other host or third-party host was very professional and understanding."

Stayed a few nights","I am not sure what happen on this trip . We first arrived and the code would not work . Good thing the host had a backup plan. We had access to a key. During our stay we were able to get the code to work. We walked in and there was mud at the front door. We left to purchase cleaning supplies . We swept and mopped and provided Ken a picture of the water. I checked the beds and the bedding needed to be re washed. I had texted the host and they promptly refunded my cleaning fee.
One main concern was a note on the kitchen cabinet stating not to was dishes in the sink . It would cause issues in the master 1/2 bath. We ended up eating out during our stay.
We did like the location very close to the base, coffee makers and comfy beds."

The location was perfect, very close to entertainment such as the local theater and many restaurants. Parking was perfect in the driveway and the security lights outside made us feel safe. Thank you Ken for being so responsive and kept a line of communication open at all times. Ken checked on us several times throughout our stay to see if we needed anything.

We didn’t have any problems but I felt like if we did they would have done everything they could have to resolve them. We were so thankful for a nice place to stay on our short trip!"

The kids enjoyed the variety of games and movies and loved having the loft to themselves. It would be possible for the cabin itself be a vacation without ever leaving! However, a day trip to Toledo Bend is well worth it. Thank you Peggy and Josh!"

Great set up outside with hanging bug spray available. The picnic table was just so right out of pinterest post; super cute!
The bed was comfortable, the shower was hot and the asthetic was nice!
Host even offered to have flashlights delivered before night fall if power wasnt restored! Very kind!
Made use of the charcoal grill during the light rain which was a great option available for a hot meal on a cool, overcast day.
Thanks again for the space between travels!"

We each took a piece of paper and wrote something we wanted to leave behind in 2023 and we threw them into the fire... it was very rewarding!!

The kitchen was fully-equipped for our Hello Fresh dinners. Having said that we spend most of the time on the front porch or by the fire-pit area on the bench. The outdoor lighting was perfect, there weren't too many bugs since this was November.
We managed a walk around the area along graveled roads and maybe saw a deer. Around the cabin were blue jays, cardinals, rabbits and even a rooster.
My wife and I definitely intend to stay here again to relax and recharge."

Stayed with kids","The cottage is so cute and private. I especially loved the outdoor areas. The house was as described, although smaller than I expected for a place that can sleep 5. We had 2 adults and a child, and more than that I think would’ve felt tight. There were lots of lovely welcoming touches and amenities and the kitchen was fully stocked and easy to use. I also found the master bedroom mattress comfortable. Our house does not have stairs so my son enjoyed climbing up to the loft where there was a pull out bed. Unfortunately in the heat the air conditioning had trouble keeping up, and the cabin got warm -even more so after I cooked. The master bedroom was the most reliably cool room throughout the day. The loft stayed very warm. There are a few fans provided to help, and there is an overhead fan which the hosts told me needed a new remote. That would also help circulate the air from the loft. I would definitely return in a cooler month when we could enjoy the outdoor areas."

Stayed with kids","Christy's place wholeheartedly deserves a five star review! I don't know where to begin! It is exactly as described, plus some! This is the best AirBnB I have ever had the pleasure of staying in. I am very observant of cleanliness and there was not a corner or a spot untouched or uncleaned in this property. There were even little toiletries laid out in the bathroom drawers, much more than what is expected - mints, facial wipes, etc.! My children loved the large yard to run around in, and I loved the quietness and privacy! We were even visited by the roosters! Everything I needed was in the home, and Christy was always responsive and helpful. The furniture is clean and comfortable. We loved that there was no TV. My children played with each other and enjoyed the children's books and played with toys. The adults talked and enjoyed the solitude. Do not hesitate AT ALL if you are in the area and need a place to stay. We will stay again when we are back in Louisiana!"

Stayed a few nights","Nana’s Cottage was an excellent find! It was very welcoming, peaceful. The furniture and beds extremely comfortable and the stone shower in Master Bedroom was amazing and large jetted tub in 2nd bathroom was great for soaking on cold winter day. The attention to detail was amazing from the decor to well stocked kitchen including snacks and coffee bar, and bathroom accessories. It was easy to find and located in a safe country setting a few minutes from town. Christy had a quick response time and left great instructions. Cabinets and light switches were clearly marked. It was easy to find and check in. The pictures accurately portray the cottage and yard but the peaceful atmosphere and special efforts put forth from these host can’t be captured by photos. Highly recommend!"

The walk in shower was amazing, as well as, the jacuzzi tub in the other bathroom. She has the best towels.
I was a bit surprised that there wasn't a TV or a radio in the house but it turned out well because my significant other and I actually got to conversate.

The kitchen was small, and the refrigerator was a mini one - we had to adjust our food purchases. (not bad though, Walmart and other stores were within 10 minutes)
The shower had low headroom, so anyone over 5 ft 8 inches would have to bend under the shower head.
If the opportunity arises to come back, we would try to use this location again."

Stayed with kids","I’ve been coming to Leesville for the last three years for my family reunion. It’s a very small quaint town. This home is by far the best listing in town I’ve found, house wise. The home is very well kept with lots of character and decorated nicely. I love the attention to detail with toiletries. All the beds in the home are very comfortable. There are not many listings in this area…. So this one is a gem!!!! I will definitely be adding this one to my favorites for the future. The host was very friendly and responsive. Check in and out instructions were very easy. Everything about the home and host is a 5/5!
FYI I don’t know if this is an every night occurrence; but trains came through at around 11pm and 1am during our stay. The house is located in downtown and it’s apparently close to the tracks."

Beautiful Home and was just as described on the Website.
Had everything you need in the Kitchen, Laundry room and Bathrooms with a lot of little xtra’s here and there , which really showed that they thought about the comfort of the guests.
Master Bedroom on the bottom floor was great for us ( Handicapped) while Mom stayed in one of the upstairs bedrooms.
Tina and her Husband added a grab bar on the tub for us in the Master Bathroom , which was really considered of them knowing that my husband is in the wheelchair.
It isn’t 100 percent ADA and we don’t want people to think it is, as it wasn’t advertised as such and we made it !"

Stayed a few nights","Wow this place was a standout by any measure. Tina's house was a joy to stay in. First, the decor is warm and welcoming. From the throw blankets thoughtfully placed around the house to the comfortable beds, to the well stocked kitchen and coffee bar to the back porch and yard with privacy fence, I would say this is the best house I have stayed in anywhere in the country. She seemed to think of everything - little soaps and coffee creamers, makeup washcloths, dishwasher tabs, charging blocks and usb ports by the beds, upstairs room air conditioners for those hot upstairs Louisiana summer nights, to little signs with instructions and easy to use home furnishings. Snacks in the bowl on our arrival were oh-so welcome. Four bottles of cold water in the fridge - just can't say enough about this place. In many parts of the country it would be ten times as expensive for all the features. Host was responsive to every message we sent. THANK YOU TINA!"

Group trip","This home was so charming and adorable! Hands down the best rental we've been to yet. The host was very thorough and thought of everything and then some to make sure our stay was pleasant and convenient. The kitchen was fully stocked with every dish and utensil you could possibly need, and even included snacks AND several options for coffee! The bath towels were so soft and everything was very clean. You can tell this is a host who cares about the home and the guests.
The home itself was very spacious and had a ton of character. The furniture, accessories, linens, and decor are all great quality and made us really feel comfortable. We were in town for 2 days to watch my son who is a paratrooper at Fort Polk do a jump, and this was a great place to come back to after being out in the heat all day. We highly recommend this if you have to find affordable accommodations for more than 4 people. It was so much nicer than staying in a hotel. Thank you Tina for making our stay so nice!"

Kylin had snacks and water for when we arrived, as well as many other thoughtful extras like playing cards, laundry pods, and she even had a fire pit ready for a fire one night. Linens were clean and smelled great, plenty of extras! Great place for our dogs to be able to run and enjoy the time as well. It was perfect!"

The mattresses were incredible, the trailer is spacious, there is a claw foot bath tub, the owners take special attention to snacks and amenities. Even down to the fluffy towels and comfy couch. I can’t rate the quality of the place high enough. The host is also a very nice woman. She was very responsive and answered all my questions extremely quickly. Plus you can’t beat the yard! My dog loved it. It was too hot (June) to enjoy the patio area but it looked lovely as well and she had wood already piled up if you wanted a fire. This is the place to stay!"

Stayed over a week","Ridgewood Retreat is just outside of Gate 6 at Fort Polk North. Much more spacious accommodation for working Reserve Component soldiers performing two weeks of AT than the hotel on post. The daily rate is about $10/day less than allowed for lodging, but the Army won't pay for additional fees: booking, cleaning, tax. I recommend charging a higher daily rate to offset lower or eliminated fees. Regardless, such premium lodging is worth the few extra dollars that I will claim when filing my taxes next year."

Stayed a few nights","After traveling for what felt like literally forever, Vernon Lake Cabin was the best place to get some rest, peace and relaxation.
The interior and exterior of the home is gorgeous and the bathroom...ABSOLUTELY STUNNING.
My experience of the cabin was nothing short of amazing. It practically felt like my home. I couldn't have come to Louisiana at a better time (weather wise) I loved hearing the many birds chirping rocking on the chairs in the back porch, reading a book and enjoying my scenery; seeing all the different insects I don't normally see up in the northeast. Beautiful sunrises and sunsets. DoorDash found the home easily if you needed to.
I would book the Vernon Lake Cabin if I were to come down to Louisiana again."

Stayed a few nights","The place is great! It rained a lot during our visit, so we weren't able to enjoy the fire pit, but the sounds of the rain of the roof was incredibly relaxing. Clearly a lot of love was put into the making of this place, all the colors and furnishings of the different parts of the cabin go great together. The living room area's super comfy, and plenty of amenities were made available. The bathroom is very spatious, and the kitchen has everything you'd need. The pull-out cabinet shelves (?) have an incredible amount of space. The area behind the house had a lot of pretty butterflies after the rain. There's a great café ten minutes away named Cuore Coffee Shop that has great iced chai"

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I stayed here for a couple of days in mid-April for a last minute getaway and were lucky to book this place! The cabin was stunning. The area was peaceful and we found it relaxing. Birds and squirrels visited us on the back deck. Our host thought of absolutely everything guests could need for an overnight stay and we so appreciated that. The little touches she added, like the skewers for roasting marshmallows near the fire pit and logs ready to go, really made our stay so much more enjoyable. The design of the cabin was modern but so warm and relaxing. Comfy couch, cozy bed, the BEST bathtub and shower, clean and well-stocked kitchen, and an a/c unit that kept us perfectly cool and sounded like soft rain (seriously, we are getting one now, we are so obsessed).
The area is super close to Lake Vernon and we found the drive into the nearby towns to be super easy. DoorDash also delivers here which was a major plus to us!
Host was super helpful and quick to respond!

Stayed a few nights","Firstly, I didn’t want to leave this place! The cabin itself is immaculate. The inside and out is like modern meets traditional; a very home-y feel.
Alyssa thought of everything! She even has an espresso maker with pods (The smoothest espresso I’ve ever had, I might add). The details of the decor were also my favorite. Everything was very clean and neat and the pictures of this cabin are exactly what you will be visiting. Very easy to find the cabin, also.
It’s so quiet and peaceful out there. You can barely hear crickets and such. There’s also a store nearby if you ever need anything.
Alyssa was very tentative, communicative, and quick to respond to everything. She’s a wonderful person and amazing host! I highly recommend this cabin to everyone; we’ll definitely be visiting again!"

The refrigerator was clean and easy to stock for our stay. The coffee station was a nice touch, though not stocked with pods we did go and get coffee pods to use. My 3yr old enjoyed the spaciousness of the interior of the home and the large TV we brought out fire stick and were able to enjoy our subscriptions w/o having to enter our information. The bedrooms were comfortable and roomy. The bathrooms clean and the washing machine/dryer were quiet and easy to operate. It was a little rainy and you are out in country a bit so the we did have a little difficulty with the WiFi reception, but Overall it was a relaxing stay once we were able to get settled in. Jordan was a great host and responsive to questions and knowledgeable about his home. Modern comforts in a country like atmosphere."

Our dogs loved the backyard and we walked down the road every morning. It would be perfect for a long stay and we plan on coming back in December! Jordan was an excellent communicator he checked on us after check in to make sure were all set. we had no issues, but he was so responsive to any questions that we had. We were so comfortable in this house. I love the area, It was rural but close to grocery shopping and very close to our son, who we were visiting. I will recommend this host and home and can't wait to return. Thank you Jordan!!"

The kitchen has lots of counter space and you can easily move around in it if you're cooking or have multiple people doing things at once. All modern appliances...loved the Keurig :) House was very easy to find and private, set back off the main road on a little dead end road so no traffic either. The closest neighbor's back yard faces the side yard of this place so we didn't feel pried upon.
The only criticism I have is the walls could use some more art/decor, they're a little bare.
Jordan was quick to respond and very nice during exchanges.
We will definitely stay here again when we come back to visit friends that we have in the area."

Stayed with kids","This how was everything and more!. My kids felt right at home, in fact a little too comfortable lol. I had to remind them we are in someone else's space. Even though we were on a dead end street, I felt safe, and everything in town was only minute away, including the army base. There were extra condiments in case you forgot some and the temperature was very comfortable. The only thing I would have liked was to be able to park in the garage since I was traveling with kids and we would get in late some nights. Other than that 5 stars definitely!!!!"

But what stood out the most, and we really appreciated, was his super fast response since our request was truly last minute. We were in the house well under an hour after we made the reservation. Most of that time was driving from town, which was near by, to the house."

The house is very spacious; very private in where it’s located as well as being central to everything in Leesville. This listing happened to be down the road from our cousins’ houses. Host was very friendly; house was a much better stay than a crammed hotel. Definitely will book again when in the area.

Stayed over a week","Jordan's home was a very quiet and calm place to be. It was on a dirt road, off of a neighborhood road. No neighbors across the street or on one side of the home. It gave us plenty of privacy to grill, hang out in the yard, or what have you. The inside of the home upon check-in, looks very much like the pictures. We stayed for six months or so, and were very glad that Jordan was able to house us the entirety of our work trip. He responded quickly to any issues that we had. The pricing structure he used was a bit confusing to everyone involved as it wasn't uniform per month, and there was a bit of confusion with the cleaning fees (I think on airbnb's end); but I would definitely recommend this home to anyone in the area. You're only 5-10 minutes away from downtown where you can find all of the restaurants even the new town favorite Whataburger. There are several hotels and other places to stay in downtown Leesville, but this will definitely feel like a home away from home."

However, this time my guest were attending a wedding and the Groom was staying there. He had out of town childhood friends drop in to visit on Friday and Saturday night, although it was not a party the neighbors was looking at the cars. We personally talked to neighbors and they said it was not an issue with people stopping by but I guess it became a problem. However, Gin and I communicated very well and we got through the weekend with no issues. I definitely would recommend this place if you are looking for a nice, cozy place to bring your family."

The kitchen is stocked with pots and pans, there's a separate dining room, fenced yard, and a desk/office area. It's an older home, but well cared for. I'm an AirB&B host and EXTREMELY picky, but I was pleasantly surprised by how nice this house is!
The best part is Gin herself. She sincerely cares about hosting and takes her work very seriously. She is easy to communicate with, and even when we had a last-minute change to our reservation, she happily accommodated us. We also received a hand-written welcome note and delicious cookies at our arrival. Gin's place made our Thanksgiving so much more comfortable!"

Gin provided everything possible to make us feel welcome and comfortable -- including a personalized welcome and baked treats! The plastic ""left over"" containers and baggies were appreciated; most Air B&Bs do not provide those and they are a necessity when eating out or cooking in.
The games and toys were a big PLUS for the kids. The recliners were a big PLUS for the adults.
The neighborhood was nice, the neighbors were pleasant to visit with, the yard was nice to sit in and for the kids to play in (grass nicely mowed and area was bug free).
Highly recommend this home when traveling to the area."

We all had plenty of bedroom and bathroom space and the living room and dining seating was great too. The labeled lights and cabinets made it effortless to find anything we needed and there were lots of items provided that you would not expect. Gin responded promptly to all inquiries. Thanks for making our family for the wedding the best it could be.

Stayed a few nights","Gin's Guest House in Deridder is one of the best homes we've ever experienced through Airbnb. She's provided a reasonably priced house that is immaculate, attractive, and very well-appointed. The house has been stocked with numerous thoughtful touches, some practical and some purely aesthetic, and all very much appreciated. The wi-fi worked very well. I didn't test it, but we obviously had a very fast connection. I'm always looking for houses with a recliner because I sleep better on one. Gin's Guest House has four in the living room! I was thrilled. Yes, I only used one, but the other three looked just as comfortable. I slept very well, by the way. The spouse said her bed was wonderful as well. The house is in a nice quiet neighborhood within five or ten (usually just five for us) minutes or so to just about any place you'd care to drive to in Deridder. Do note, as some other reviews have pointed out, that there isn't a TV in the house. If you have to have one, this isn't your Airbnb solution. Spouse and I don't go on trips to watch TV so we didn't expect or miss one. We did, for the first time ever in an Airbnb home, play some rousing games of Sorry, using one of the games in the sun room. I loved the desk setup in the sun room for my laptop. I could go on and on. This is just a really nice house that provided all we could reasonably want in an Airbnb. If we get back over to Deridder, we'll definitely be wanting to stay here again."

The neighborhood is so quiet, the location is perfect and the hostess is so helpful and makes everything so easy. Gin was always available to answer any questions and went above and beyond any other Airbnb has done. Upon arrival we were taken back at how relaxing the atmosphere was, the hospitality of snacks, coffee and everything you could possibly need. The house is beautiful and the decor is amazing. The price was very affordable!! I would definitely stay again in the future over any hotel room in the area for the price!"

Everything is clearly labeled for ease of use (cabinet contents, light switches, etc.) and it has a very well stocked kitchen. Our communication with Gin was perfect and her special welcomes, including home baked breads, were so appreciated. I can absolutely say, if this fits your group's needs, this is a superior experience and value versus local hotels (I've now done both). Many thanks for our good experience!"

We had everything that we needed during our stay. The host has even put labels on every cabinet/drawer so you don't have to search for things. The beds were comfortable and the neighborhood was very quiet. The only con I saw was there is no TV in the home. This didn't affect our stay but if you have children you may want to bring a laptop/iPad so that they can watch videos. There is good WiFi there for that purpose."

Lots of labels on things, bottled water in fridge and snacks on the counter, a Keurig with lots of options. Nice size shower in master bathroom. In fair weather the back lawn is perfect for grilling or relaxing and the small table in the carport is ideal for morning coffee. It is just as pictured or even better!
