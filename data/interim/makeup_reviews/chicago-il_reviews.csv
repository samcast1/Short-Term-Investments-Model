The expressway is very close so you can get to the city quick. If you are looking for a place to stay I recommend this one. I will definitely book again when I come back to Chicago. Thanks Leslie!!

It’s so conveniently located to shops, a large grocery store and restaurants. We often rent a car when we come here and there’s always a place to park near the apartment. The only thing one has to watch out for are the parking restrictions when there are Cubs games. I highly recommend this apartment or any other unit offered by David on Airbnb."

Stayed a few nights",We needed a place to stay for the weekend when dropping our daughter off at a nearby college apartment. David even gave us some tips for parking the U-Haul. This was a great apartment in a nice neighborhood. I would not recommend this for someone who doesn’t like to climb a few flights of stairs. I actually enjoyed the exercise! The air conditioners worked wonderfully during our warmest day at the end of August. The only minor issue was the water pressure… But I’ve come to expect that in older buildings.

David is an excellent, responsive, and friendly host. Check in w& check out were contact-less and easy.
The apartment is a 4th floor walk up, by the way, which might be important for some folks to know."

Stayed a few nights","I found Mia & Noah's 1BR furnished apartment on the internet under an Air B&B search and was immediately impressed by how clean and spacious it looked. The apartment was just as described, albeit maybe a little less modern. It is in an old building which gives it both charm, big windows that let in natural light but also creaky floors and an ""older"" but not dilapidated feel. It was just fine for our needs and we had a very comfortable stay. We would stay here again and found communication with the hosts very easy and helpful."

Stayed a few nights","I've stayed here before and the host is very responsive and the place is very well maintained, clean, and felt like home.
My only challenge was that Chicago was experiencing a really cold day (-11degree F) and i arrive around midnight to find the key in the lockbox was frozen in ~1inch of solid ice. Mia was responsive and tried to get me another key from another unit in with a different lockbox, but the key was gone already. After buying a torch lighter from the drugstore (which didn;'t work), and then finding a gas station open all night - was able to get boiling water which melted the ice and let me get the key. Mia was responding to AirBnB notes for about 45min while i was trying these different options (it WAS very cold!). Happy i was able to get in by 1am."

Stayed a few nights",We didn’t feel comfortable at this location. It was shabby and the living room furniture stained and unclean. The paint was chipping off of door frames and it looked like mildew was just painted over. The kitchen was adequate but was just adequate. The bed was clean as was the bathroom. It appeared that the maid service was really good but the general furnishings and maintenance were poor. We could only stay one night of our 4 night stay and found other lodging for the last three nights.

They immediately responded to any questions we had regarding window, key box and locating trash bins. Basic toiletries and kitchen utilities were available. We felt at home. Street parking is hard to come by. We made the right call for us and decided to call an Uber whenever we visited the City. Locally we enjoyed going for walks and exploring the neighborhood’s restaurants. It was a plus to have a Trader Joe’s and a CVS nearby. Overall we enjoyed our stay and would certainly consider staying at Mia and Noah’s place again."

Stayed a few nights","We did not enjoy our stay. Unit is very tired looking. It seems to be a company that manages many units and they are robotic in their responses. Terrible internet and tv signals, unreliable water temp in shower, no coffee mugs. They give you the minimum number of towels (very thin) and don’t like it when you ask for more. They hounded us to put the key to the building into the outside lockbox after each use but the lockbox was by the street. They couldn’t put another key in there? We were coming to help out with a relative who is dying and they sounded like they might be flexible on checkout date since we had no idea how long we would need to stay. Didn’t help us at all when we asked to check out early because we needed to go stay with the relative. I am an air bnb host and I would never treat guests this way."

Stayed a few nights","This is definitely not a place to work remote from. The router wifi is located in another apartment (unbeknown to us prior to booking) and the wifi signal dropped on a consistent basis, impacting our ability to work. At first, the owner responded to the messages about the wifi and reset it once, but after 3 messages he stopped responding completely. The furniture in the apartment looks good, but is not suited for sitting for a long time. The bedroom window has no curtains and the sun will wake you at sunrise, even when wearing a night mask. The towels provided are very low quality and you can not get extras. Overall you get what you pay for... wouldn't stay there again."

Stayed a few nights","One day before arrival, our original spot we booked was under maintenance, so we had to change locations quite quickly. Thankfully, Mia offered another place right away, I was very grateful rather than just canceling! The spot was very close to the original and accurate to what we originally were looking for. My only suggestion would be for a little tweak in describing how to get in to the location. It was easy to find the actual place, but the address is listed “1N” and there’s nothing I could find on the apartment that stated which door was which to get into, as the lockbox which I eventually found just listed “7” - also check in instructions say use the “blue or red key” and all keys attached were silver and gold. Not a big deal at all if you just use a little brain power to figure it out. We had a fabulous time over the weekend, great for a couple getaway, house was cute, cozy and great price for 2 nights. Thanks!"

My priorities are always cleanliness and location. I can honestly say I’d rate both highly. With location it’s important that I feel safe and there’s much to do. This is a family oriented neighborhood. I felt comfortable walking alone even at nighttime. It’s close to stores, restaurants, cafes, and grocery stores.
If your interest is in sight seeing, this Airbnb is a 5-7 minute walk to the Brown line making it simple to get to the city and other neighborhoods.
I recommend this Airbnb and will be staying at this location in the future"

Stayed over a week","This is a cozy apartment with a comfortable bed in a quiet neighborhood. The kitchen is not designed to allow for much cooking but there are plenty of restaurants nearby. The hosts quickly responded when we told them the bathroom door wouldn't shut and fixed the problem, but before I booked this place, I asked what floor it was on and the unit turned out to be on a higher floor than what I was told. Also, we were given only one key to the building itself and were told we couldn't have a second one. We stayed here for two weeks and having only one key meant it was very difficult for my husband and me to go anywhere separately."

We accidentally forgot our watch in the unit, Which we realized very quickly, but then had some trouble reaching someone immediately to try to get it back.

Easy check-in / check-out instructions. The place was super clean and quiet. Overall great stay and will keep in mind next time I have friends / family visiting and looking to stay in the neighborhood."

Check-in was super easy (I’d say it is self checking, though I don’t think the listing says as much).
Communication was stellar. Bed was comfy. Couch, not so much. AC units worked great and unit was cool when I arrived. Big bonus on a hot day in the city."

Stayed a few nights","A nice place and quiet environment with shops within a 10-minute walk. The nearest metro station (brown line) is 5 minutes walk from the accommodation which is very convenient.
A small downside to the noise in the apartment: some nights we could hear very late (after midnight) steps above us and it was sometimes difficult to fall asleep.
Other than that, the stay was pleasant, the apartment is comfortable and the neighborhood is quiet."

Chicago but easy access to train mitigates it and price reflects locale vs closer to downtown. As noted in other reviews, floors are very thin and can hear every step from upstairs and movements will undoubtedly be heard downstairs. Radiators heater did not seem to have ability to control the level of heat. Overall, clean and good value."

Stayed a few nights","Seems like a complicated check-in process, but the instructions were very clear. It was quite easy to follow the instructions when you were in front of the building. Never had any issues getting in or out. The hosts were communicative with me. Great little location - some fun places to eat within walking distance. Bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper - as the other reviews mention, it's an old building - you can hear people moving about very easily. This wasn't a bother for me though. If you are using the couch for sleeping, you may want to bring your own sheets and blanket. I didn't see any in the closets. Finding a spot to park could be an issue if you are coming and going often. After circling the place a few times on the day I arrived (a Friday around 8 pm), I was able to find a spot on the street about a block down from the building. I didn't have to drive again until I left on Sunday, so I'm not sure how parking is at different times of the day. I will definitely try to stay there again if the occasion arises!"

You can occasionally hear neighbors upstairs walking around but no more than in any other Chicago apartment. The location is great - tons of restaurants, easy access to downtown and there's a Starbucks less than a 5 min walk away. Mia was very responsive with any questions via the Airbnb app. I'd definitely stay at Mia & Noah's place again without any hesitation!"

However, it was a nice location and if the host addresses the issue before letting other guests stay, it could be a good Airbnb."

Comfortable bed, good size desk for working, own fridge in the room, plenty of space for unpacking and settling in, and a private bathroom. For those not familiar with the area, the location is great. You're a short walk to the Kimbal station for the Brown line. You can walk a block north or a couple blocks south for lots of dining options. No issues with parking whatsoever. It's about a 25-30 minutes by car by surface streets to the downtown loop. You're a couple minutes from the freeway. Kids and families are out and about in the neighborhood; no safety concerns at all.
I also stayed in Jaime's other listing for a few nights, one of the units downstairs in the same home. Similarly, it was comfortable, clean, and functional. Great stay as well!"

Parking was almost always available right out front (was there for a week and only once had to park around the corner, very close by) and the neighborhood was quiet and safe. I will certainly recommend this place to my friends and family if they ever need a place to stay in the city."

Stayed a few nights","Perfect !
The room was so much tidy and clean, nice closet, desk for using your laptop daily. My biggest concern is always cleanliness of the bathroom and it was perfect! You have your own key for the room and for the main door of the house. There is also a nice mini fridge in the room so you can bring your own stuff and keep it cold in there. Kitchen and the living room were very clean too. I loved the living room, it was full of histories from London days that they visited before. They are also Friends fan, favorite !
The location is perfect, Irving Park. Very safe area and neighborhood. There is free street parking outside, you can always find a spot to park your car.
I am so glad that I've found Jaime's place. He and his wife are so kind, friendly and warm couple. Always smiling and asking if everything is okay with the room and the amenities. They are respectful to silence of the house and also helping for recommendations about anything you would ask for in the city.
I'd definitely choose this place again, 10/10 !"

I had great communication and had a problem-free stay. Close to a number of great restaurants and cafés, and the neighborhood is very nice for strolling on an autumn day. To folks who might be leery of staying in a private room within the host's apartment, Jaime and Mariana were very respectful of my privacy."

The place was always clean and had everything you need. He even put some extra touches like toothbrushes, loofahs, etc. He also has two cute, extremely friendly, little dogs that greet you as soon as you walk in, they were great! Jamie also got me two personal size Giordanos pizzas during my stay, they were amazing! The bathroom is not shared so you have full access to that as well as having access to a full kitchen which was super helpful for me since I I to do a lot of meal prepping. The area is really nice around him as well and it was very easy to find parking.
If you are looking for an affordable, comfortable place to stay, Jamie's got the place for you! Thanks again for everything, I wish I could have spent the rest of my stay in Chicago with you!"

I knew ahead of time about the additional fee, so that didn't come as a surprise to me like I read in some of the reviews. The room was small, but found it to be a good size for one person. Even though the room was close to the elevators, I didn't find it bothersome. I slept soundly and I'm not a light sleeper. They were also very responsive about an small issue with the AC. A maintenance staff came to make adjustments to the thermostat. I'll definitely consider Hotel Felix again."

Stayed a few nights","Hotel Felix is a decent hotel, this not an “airbnb” per se as it’s just booking a normal hotel through this app. Room is quite small, but big enough. Felt more up to date than your average hotel around this price point. That being said it’s barebones: no mini fridge, no microwave, no view from the room and no pool. There is a pretty large TV though which was nice, and ice on the level. Location is really good with plenty of restaurants/stores, and easy access to the red line. They provide a couple snacks for breakfast and coffee - better the nothing. Lobby is very nice and staff was helpful enough - ***make sure you don’t change the check in time, the hotel will not respond to your request and your reservation will not go through, you need to keep the check in time 3-5pm.***
This hotel is going to be a place to sleep, and it’s not luxury but if you get a good price I would recommend staying here."

Not really an issue for 1-2 nights, but something to think about for longer stays. Staff were lovely and accommodating. I was taken aback that they intentionally chose to NOT audibly say my room number at check in. They simply said “you can find your room number on this card”. That was such a nice touch, considering there were lots of people around at the time."

Happy to hear that there was early check in for a fee or option to hold the bags. I was told that they hold $75 for incidentals and the early check-in would deduct from that. I was disappointed at checkout that I was charged multiple taxes, the resort/urban fee, and my early check in fee which totaled more than the $75 hold. The experience would have been better if everything was explained up front and fully at check-in."

Stayed one night","Hotel Felix has great location and perfectly clean. Good internet.
Our only major problem is that they imposed a $22 surcharge upon check-in. When we protested, they immediately brandished a print-out of their Airbnb listing to claim that it had appeared. (Clearly, we were not the first protestors.) When we showed them our Airbnb account and challenged them to find it, they couldn't. Finally, one of the receptionists agreed to waive the fee. But we won't know if that went through til they refund the deposit that they also charged of $75.
Surprise surcharges and big deposits to be refunded at hotel discretion and timetable are part of the reason we switched to Airbnb in the first place. Airbnb needs to require of hotels that they put in writing on the official Airbnb site the hotels' true terms and prices. It is not fair to honest Airbnb hosts to hide terms and costs. Links or fine print are not enough. State it Straight."

Stayed one night","Great location! Friendly staff. Lots of nearby parking options, and places to walk.
Parking: used Spot Hero to find discounted overnight parking spot less than 1/2 mile away. Note: you reserve your spot online ahead of time. However, I did pay for on-street parking (a block away) for the first hour to get aquatinted with the area, carry luggage in, check-in, and then I reserved my spot online from my phone in hotel room.
Room: was small like the reviews say; however, I found myself not minding the room size after about 20 minutes. Cute and modern.
Stairs: If you opt to take the stairs instead of the elevator, a staff person must walk up to 2nd floor with you to let you into the stairwell. I guess this is due to a programming issue when the hotel got new keycards - so perhaps this will be fixed in the future. However, access to the stairs to exit is unlocked from your room floor - nice!
Lobby: welcoming, clean, friendly, modern artsy."

Stayed a few nights","Loved Hotel Felix, location was close to everything and walkable, however, when I checked out and got to the airport I realized I forgot something on the bed because it was blending in. I called and they claimed they didn’t find it… I figured I must of just had it in my bag and waited til I got home (SFO) to do a thorough check and did not find it. I know for a fact I left it on the bed because I never put it in my tiny purse which is where I keep it-_-
Moral of the story, if you forget something expect for house keeping to just keep it for themselves."

Stayed one night","Unfortunately, my partner and I encountered a family emergency that required a change in our travel plans. Despite several interactions with both the hotel and Airbnb, none was capable of resolving this matter.
During my conversation with the front desk at the hotel, we discovered that Airbnb rented our hotel room through a third party (called Hotel Tonight). We called this other company, and the said that only Airbnb could solve the situation. After several messages and phone calls with Airbnb, our situation --simply a change in our reservation date-- was not addressed."

Stayed a few nights","Hotel Felix was a great place to stay for our short trip to Chicago. The room looked just like the photos and was fairly clean. Bed was super comfortable as well. A little bit of an older building/space, but it was perfect for what we needed in our short time there. Only complaint I had was we stayed for 3 nights and no one ever came into the room to clean/swap out our used towels. Not sure if this was something we needed to physically request at the front desk, but we kept putting the sign on the door knob to come in and clean and nothing was ever touched.
Overall, great stay & I'd stay here again in the future."

This time I booked this through AirBnb for the first time. The AirBnb listing did not mention the $22 per night hotel fee anywhere. The employee checking me in apologized and even stated they have contacted Airbnb multiple times to have this added. She was very nice about it but it’s frustrating that the listing was misleading about the price. Will of course go back again, but will not book through Airbnb again. Book through Priceline if you want the full price up front."

The hotel doesn’t respond through the Airbnb app so you must contact the hotel directly. Rooms can be pretty warm - even in the February but opening the window cooled it off enough. Perfect distance to everything in Chicago.

The hallway is incredibly small as well and you can hear your neighbors. When it’s time for you to check out, the hotel staff will call and come by your room multiple times basically harassing you to check out. Beware the hotel charges you a number of fees that they do not disclose and they have charged my card multiple times and I still can’t get a resolution. The price on airbnb vs what you actually end up paying is not worth it and you end up paying double. Overall, I wouldn’t stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","Very nice, clean, minimalistic stay. Hotel Felix is easy to find and in a perfect location in River North. There are many coffee shops, restaurants, grocery stores and corner markets. Public transportation is great. it's very walkable to Chicago's famous museums and parks.
I loved the lobby to hang out with friends and have lunch or a coffee.
This place was perfect for a stay in the city where you want to be out and about but the hotel room is very minimalistic. It has everything you need to be comfortable but don't expect lots of amenities. There is minimal amount of staff--mainly at the hotel lobby--so don't expect room service or making special requests.
Overall very worth the price though given the location, cleanliness and level of comfort. Also I was able to make a last minute booking and it was very flexible.
Working remotely is also not really an option because the WiFi is terrible. Bring an Ethernet cable if you need to video call!"

Now, on the second time, I was missing stuff from my room, for example I had no body wash, which they charged me extra for, a bath robe, and the shower curtain was too high, so every time I showered, the bathroom flooded. I tried asking for a room change, but the girl at night, wasn’t helpful at all, she said to come back downstairs in the morning to solve it out.
They gave me a better treatment overall the shorter my stay. 5 stars on my one night stay, 3 stars on my 4 day stay 👎🏻"

The location couldn’t be better - one block from a ton of bars and restaurants, 5 minute walk from the L, and 10 minute walk from the lake. The unit is recently renovated, very clean, and well stocked with all that I needed for an extended stay (toiletries, dishes, aluminum foil, etc). Don was easy to communicate with and shared clear instructions for check in and out. Only things to note are that the unit has very little natural light, no central AC (bedroom window unit works great), no in unit laundry (shared laundry is across the hall), and you can hear noise from upstairs - but these things were minor inconveniences far outweighed by everything else it offered. If I am ever back in Chicago, this is the first place I’ll look to stay again!"

The only negative about this apt is that there is very little natural daylight because there is only one window in the bedroom and one in the living area. They have many lamps and very good indoor lighting to compensate for this. The other negative for people who are older is that the bed is only about one foot off the ground. Once you are in the bed, it is very comfortable. It was a very pleasant place to stay in a great neighborhood."

Honestly i did not even get mad because we where treated so well at the Hotel and it was so nice that i did not mind going back to get some rest and then fond out there is a casino 5 min away!
Since the 1st day when i called they where really flexible about our check in because our flight fot delayed 3x and we got to O'hare around 3am. they gave us clear instructions of where to get the hotel shuttle and the shuttle took less than 15min to pick us up which was really satisfying since we where very very tired. check un was very smooth and our room... OMG way way better than described. had a comfy king size bed, very spacious little kitchen with stove, microwave, mini fridge, mini dishwasher. i literally fell in love that im even thinking about going back to another festival next month and i for sure will stay there again. also their breakfast is good. staff is very friendly!"

The listing does not mention a coffee pot but there is one along with a dishwasher, burners, microwave and fridge. Very nice if you plan to eat in.
It’s too bad they charge for parking because if you pay for that it gets expensive."

The bathroom door was a sliding door, so make sure you’re very comfortable with whoever you share the room with. The king bed was relatively comfy, but the pillows were pretty dreadful; super lumpy and flat. I’d bring my own next time."

It’s a little bit of a beaten up apartment, but we weren’t spending that much time in the Airbnb so it didn’t really matter. Also the walls and floor above are paper thin so you can hear other apartments, but it didn’t bother us that much cause neighbors were generally quiet. Overall solid!"

Stayed a few nights","Martys place was the perfect location for all things Chicago. Located minutes away from all hot areas - like Lincoln Park, Michigan Ave., and Wrigleyville. The residential area was situated amongst a beautiful strip of shops, restaurants, and entertainment. The building itself was an older and well loved structure, but the apt. was updated and had all the amenities we needed for our weekend trip. The air conditioner was a bit spotty, but we had a nice cool weekend where we were able to open the windows. The lock situation was also a little sketchy, but the door was reinforced with 2 other locks as well, so it was not a big deal. While there is street parking, it is few and in between. I suggest Spot Hero, we found a spot in a private lot less than 1 block away! Marty communicated everything in advance and with clear directions. They checked in frequently and made me feel like I could come to them about anything. 10/10 would stay again!"

I loved the amenities and the laundry room downstairs was accessible. I asked a neighbor but I don’t remember seeing that in the check in details. Also there is a trash chute that I don’t remember seeing in the check in details. Neighbors were friendly with overall help and attitude. Marty was great and responsive to all my questions. Overall very happy with my stay but, the towels, bathroom toilet, walls, dishes, and couch could be cleaner. The towels had stains. The bathroom toilet needed more cleaning. The walls had marks. The bathroom door handle was loose. The blinds were broken in some places and taped back together. The dish plates had food stains. The couch had a stain on it. The locks are somewhat confusing but nothing too hard to figure out. The air conditioner doesn’t stay on long. It gets hot in there."

Stayed a few nights","We really enjoyed our stay at Marty’s place. The location was awesome; close to the bus line plus there were so many great paces to easily walk to from there. The place was also easy to find and instructions for getting in were clear and concise.
If you plan on parking there, be sure to check street signs and know when and where you can park, and for how long. We found a spot right in front of the building and were able to leave our car there for the entire time we were there, but we did get lucky with finding such a close spot. There were other spots available, but several blocks away so just be aware of that.
Our only complaint on the place was that the walls are extremely thin and it felt like we could hear everything going on in the apartments above and around us. Overall though, that isnt enough of a detriment to stop us from wanting to stay there again if we end up back in the area. Thanks Marty!"

Stayed a few nights","Nice, safe, and beautiful neighborhood near restaurants and shops. Efficient, updated, and clean space -- perfect for a couple of people. The bathroom was clean. The cleaning lady was working on the shower floor when we arrived at check-in time so the door was ajar. The key was given to us by the cleaning lady when she finished shortly after we arrived, but I think based on the way she was tinkering with the lock box, we might have had some issues trying to get it out ourselves. Linens were soft, but bed could have been more supportive. Great kitchen with range, oven, microwave, and refrigerator. We didn't cook, per se, due to concerns about all the equipment we would need to make Thanksgiving dinner, but there were enough dishes and bowls for takeout for 3 people. Well heated, maybe overly so, but easy to adjust temperature by opening windows. Our host was quick to respond to problems and was kind with my lack of technical prowess with the TV! We felt safe walking the neighborhood."

Stayed a few nights","Definitely a hidden gem as it looked a little sketchy on the outside but that actual Bnb is very modern with up to date appliances. Difficult to find parking. The building has its own underground parking lot only for its main residents. I recommend parking at the Broadway & Surf Lot about 2 blocks away. (5 minute walk). For the most part the apartment was clean but I can tell nooks and crannies were overlooked in cleaning. One of the biggest pros about this Bnb is the location, it is close to everything and if you don’t want to lose your park Ubering to locations were cheap (under $8 personally). My biggest con here was that the bed and floors were VERY squeaky. Overall I would book this location again."

Everything you could want or need - really enjoyed the outside space and the quiet adorable location. Outstanding food nearby plus a L station was close for a visit to Wrigleyville and an Uber downtown was $20. No parking hassle and a hot mid-80’s weekend in May the AC was very appreciated. Book this AirBnB you won’t regret it.

Stayed a few nights","I don't know if I'm brilliant, or just lucky, to have found this place for my dad and I for our trip to Chicago. We found ourselves lingering in the morning, just enjoying the space, the patio, the coffee, the nearby breakfast/bakeries.
Charming and modern interior, decorated warmly. Comfortable sitting and dining spaces, both indoors and outside. Each bedroom nicely sized, with comfy beds and linens, with TVs! Roomy bathroom, with easily enough room for both of our stuff. Stocked kitchen with any utensil or appliance you might need. Plenty of coffee pods!
This location cannot be beat! A short walk to a bus downtown, or a slightly longer walk to a train downtown. Parking was never a problem, usually directly in front of the unit. The neighborhood is mostly quiet, lovely.
We had to reach out to owners for a question- they addressed it immediately. We felt welcomed and cared for. Excellent attention to detail with all instructions. Would absolutely stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","One of my best Airbnb experiences ever. Everything is well-taught. Clear instructions for everything. There is nothing that you cannot find or that you need: details in bathroom and kitchen are mind-blowing. The location is safe and super convenient surrounded by many local bakeries, cafes, and restaurants. (and tbh, Chicago isn't always too safe. so this is very important!) super clean, beautiful, and comfortable for a group of 4. There's a cute patio that offers you a nice little outdoor experience as well.
There are just a few points that can potentially be improved: 1. the heating system is not working equally distributed: the bathroom gets too hot, but the master bedroom stays comparatively cold. 2. The smell from the bathroom stays around the kitchen and hallway for some time after you use it. 3. The door from the bathroom to the bedroom didn't close properly.
All in all, it was nothing but a 5-star experience. We loved our stay there, and we'll definitely go back again. tnx"

There are restaurants within walking distance and a fully furnished kitchen, complete with staples, if you feel like tucking in to a meal “at home.” A full service grocery store is approximately a half mile from the apartment for forgotten items. Micro was not working during our visit but we were told a new one is coming soon.
A simply delightful stay, although too short. We would love to return! Thank you Evan and Jill for sharing your home with us!"

Stayed a few nights",We had a great stay at Garret Family's home. Their apartment was comfortable and it had everything we needed and beyond. It is in a centrally located neighborhood within walking distance to restaurants and cafes. The hosts were super responsive and clear in their communication. Definitely recommend staying here for your visit to Chicago.

Stayed a few nights","I am in love with this apartment and want to find a reason to return to Chicago as soon as possible just to stay here. My dad and I came into town for the Bears game and this place was perfect for us. There are great restaurants and shops just a block up, the neighborhood is quiet and quaint, and it honestly felt like we were returning home every time we came back from being out. Our flights came in earlier than the listed check in time, and the Garretts were so kind and accommodating an earlier check in - even saying they thought the trip sounded like so much fun and wishing us safe travels. The inside was so clean, we were able to help ourselves to everything there - including the wine! The instructions and requests were extremely clear and more than reasonable to follow. The beds were SO comfortable and we both slept great. I'm sorry we couldn't stay longer just to have an excuse to use the kitchen! I could go on forever. If you're staying in Chicago, you need to stay here."

The linens were stocked, fresh, clean. The Garrett Family even had a stocked pantry!!!
Parking was easy considering I was in Chicago.

It's an easily accessible unit and the instructions for entering are very clear. It's location is in a safe area and well lit. There was plenty of parking available on the street.
The rental is extremely clean and well decorated. Extra linens, pillows and towels were all available. We did have to remove some of the decorations (vases, trays etc) out of the reach of our toddler to avoid being mishandled.
The patio outback is a nice touch. The unit is walking distance to restaurants, cafes and shops. The description and photos are exactly what you get, which was exactly what we hoped for. It's a perfect place for friends and families. And we'd absolutely stay again when visiting Chicago."

The location is a 10 min walk to a train, and much closer to a few bus lines, so we found it easy to get around with our 12 and 6 year old. Restaurants nearby make getting a meal out easy, but the kitchen is so well prepared it was easy for us to make a few meals in as well.
Communication was quick and easy when we had questions. Overall, this was a great stay and a wonderful apartment."

Stayed with kids","This is a terrific location and all the amenities are high quality. We have all been in Airbnb's with single ply TP and the thinnest of garbage bags the hosts expect you to get to the garbage can without breaking. The Garrets place carries the quality all the way to the small details. It's also beautiful but comfortable and my 4 yr old loved running off energy on the back patio. There was always close parking available and you don't feel like you are putting your life in danger if you need to cross the street to get to it. Plus terrific food options within a couple blocks. It's also super affordable. And they responded fast to a small problem. My husband's family has 2 condos on Millennium Park that we usually can stay in for free (family wedding, so not this trip) and we loved it so much he said the next time we visit Chicago, we will stay here again instead of the free condo downtown!"

I love that there were multiple places The Garrett Family said were close by and worth going too! You have to try the Stax Cafe, it’s right around the corner from the apartment. ☺️ 10/10 would stay here again!!"

Their home was stylish and made you feel like you actually lived there. The location is great, Taylor Street has a college town feel with various places to eat. A short walk to bus routes that will take you downtown or wicker Park. Also close to Trains. The area is safe and quiet. Definitely recommend staying here if you want to visit Chicago!"

The apartment is styled great and the back patio is absolutely wonderful for enjoying your morning coffee. The neighborhood is really safe and just a quick uber ride to get downtown or to any other neighborhood you would like. The hosts are very quick with replies also. We noticed the toilet had a leak when we first checked in and the host had it fixed while we were out the next afternoon. We would definitely stay here again on our next visit to Chicago.

Stayed over a week","If you plan a trip to Chicago, especially around the UIC and Rush University areas this is a perfect choice. We stayed during winter time and either Universities were easily reached by using Lyft or an Uber. The entrance to the apt is easily accessible and elderly friendly(no climbing staircases). You can get your meals from the cafes or restaurants from the next block. The Garretts were very understanding and accommodating host with our special needs. They are also helpful with directions, instructions and questions in regards to Chicago area. The whole apt felt like home to us. We hope to visit Chicago again in a better season and we will definitely choose this apt again.

Stayed a few nights","The good:
Great value for what you get. Affordable, comfortable, great location, great staff. Overall, we enjoyed our stay at this hotel.
The bad:
Be careful booking a hotel like this through Airbnb. Because we booked through a third party they put a hold on our card for pretty much the total we already paid through Airbnb. If you have room on your card, this isn't a bit issue, but things were tight for us, as we were on a longer trip and this created a great deal of consternation. My biggest issue was that the concierge didn't mention that the hotel would put such a high hold on our card. I hope in future the Millennium Knickerbocker will work better with Airbnb, and be clear about their policies both on the booking and through the check-in process."

We parked in the alley behind the building , which is a no-no, as we found out. We’re sorry! I think we were happy just to find the place in pouring rain and just never used the car.
(Might make that clearer, though, that no parking is allowed in the alley.) Thank you for a wonderful Chicago weekend!"

We appreciate the flexible checkin and checkout, all the proactive tips and caring. One tip for a future light sleeper, to bring earplugs because the floor s make noises and the neighbors walk could wake you up. Not a big deal and easy to fix! Will recommend this place NO DOUBT!

Stayed with a pet","We stayed at Nicole’s over the Thanksgiving break. Because we drove into town, it was important to find a place that offered parking. Nicole was very accommodating of our early check-in, which we greatly appreciated.
The unit itself was cute but I couldn’t imagine more than two people staying there, including a couple with a child. Since we came during a cold time, storage was limited, and we found ourselves draping our coats over chairs rather than having a closet.
The unit seemed like she lives in there part-time, which we wish we knew before. The small kitchen was way too cluttered with the stove/counter filled with spices (nice but adds to the clutter) and a fridge filled with condiments. The closet space needed for coats and to put our bags away were locked. We felt like we were invading her space.
The area itself was good. Close to the El and some ok restaurants.
Overall the place is good. I would not stay here again though."

I come to Chicago every year to run the marathon and all I’m looking for is a quiet place that is convenient to the train. Nicole’s place was far more. I feel very fortunate to have lucked into her place on one of the busiest weekends of the year in Chicago.
She was proactive with check in, check out, and recommendations. I didn’t need much but everything you could need is there. The place was spotless, the bed was by far the most comfortable I’ve had in a rental unit. To top it off, the bath towels are better than any hotel.
Do not pass this place up if you are looking for your Chicago exploration base camp.
Thanks so much to Nicole and her husband for the best Airbnb experience I’ve ever had."

Clean, beautifully furnished, and more than enough space. The neighborhood was very cool and we ordered in deep dish one of the nights. Nicole is friendly, responsive, and provides perfect recommendations. You must stay here if you are in Chicago; it will enhance and complete your stay."

Stayed a few nights","Absolutely excellent place to stay both for the proximity to Wrigley, and just overall.
Awesome location, beautiful condo, and nice outdoor area which was a plus.
The host was very friendly and super communicative, and even took the time to write out her favorite things to do and places to see on the chalkboard wall in the hallway. Nice touch for sure.
Very comfortable bed and great amenities all the way around.
Would highly recommend for anyone visiting Chicago for any reason!"

The instructions to check in as well the instructions all around the house are VERY detailed… it helped a lot!
The bed was really comfortable and the shower… well, the shower is something you have to try! Absolutely incrível! It was great to relax there after a day walking around Chicago.
The neighborhood was calm and there are a few restaurants and malls close to the place.
I would definitely recommend Zane’s place!"

The bathroom was very nice and the shower was amazing. Zane communicated very well with me. I would recommend Zane’s place.

Stayed one night","Read the booking carefully. Advertised as $55 but after +$11 in taxes & ~$6 in resort fee +$50 deposit the total was +$70 for the room & $120 w/ the deposit. It’s been over 2 days & I still haven’t gotten my deposit back.
Check in Staff was a little rude. My bathroom didn’t have a lock which is very unsafe. Anybody can walk in while you’re taking a shower w/ just a flimsy shower curtain separating you. Random people are coming in & out of the room at any time. It wasn’t “dirty” but you’re staying in a lived in room, so expect some mess / clutter. The previous guest left a few items behind.
Great area, lots to do. CVS is next door, Ballys Casino is across the street, jewel is at the corner, shake shack & goddess are down the block.
Decent value for the area if you just need a bed to crash for the night & a hot shower. The bar in the lobby is pretty good. They serve a decent breakfast in the morning (paid) but this wasn’t available during my visit."

Stayed a few nights",I had a great stay (besides that guy in my room that snored really loudly - but it’s not hostel’s fault). The dorm and the bathroom were cleaner than I thought they would be. It was a 100% worth it!

Daily new fresh towel is a plus and freehand is quick to meet your needs.
Stuff is very friendly and helpful.
Location is just two blocks from Michigan Ave. Ohio street is quiet busy by late morning otherwise great place to stay and enjoy Chicago city life ."

The hostel rooms are simply unbeatable for the price and the perfect option if you’re in town for just the night and looking for a place to sleep. I brought my own lock this time and went to the front desk before parking to get the discounted rate, I highly recommend doing the same. Only complaint was the bar closing early. Looking forward to my next stay!"

Stayed a few nights","I dont know where to start. Make sure you call before booking if you live in the state, they dont put all pertinent information on the airbnb listing. I was told, with an attitude approach, that I should have looked at their websiteBesides that which I understand, the bald white guy that works at the front desk was nasty and discriminative from the moment I walked in. He even started yelling at me and calling me out of my name. He was not being communicative, he was condescending, and I would have beat him up of it didnt mean jail time. Theres a clutter of thugs and homeless at the entrance, which reeks of urine. Besides that the location is great of course. I digress."

The listing is generally as advertised.
The cleanliness is not at the top but it remains acceptable for the price.
However, be careful to secure all your belongings in the locker when you are outside the accommodation, I had the misfortune to leave a few things on my bed, these were taken by the housekeeper, incomprehensible... I was fortunately able to recover the majority of what was taken except a towel...
Other than that the accommodation is well located."

Cleaning area that helped me a lot and a free luggage handling service that they offered me when I checked out that saved the day, really a very good place if you are looking for a good price, good location and if you don't mind sharing a room"

The community areas are amazing. Up to 4 strangers to a room is a little intense. Front desk suggested an amazing dance club. Some workers were friendly others were cold. Beds were quite comfortable but small. Rooms were very dark and if your roommate isn’t awake it’s very difficult to see inside. Bathroom light was very dim. Can’t say I wouldn’t come back for the price.

however the review never mentioned a FIFTY DOLLAR DEPOSIT ON A $22 ROOM!!!

But other things were okay and staffs are really nice and gentle, so I would really appreciate for them.
And if you are not familiar to sleeping with other people, you may not choose shared room. No blocking of snoring and other noise.
To Freehand, I liked this hotel besides the smell, so I would recommend you guys change the defuser or enhance the ventilation inside. Thanks"

There’s extra charges (5$/day tax) and 50$ security deposit (yet to receive back), that they don’t tell you about on the listing. There was also a bug on my bag one morning, with no soap available in the washroom as well. Terrible people, decent place, AirBnB needs to do better with such hosts that do not communicate, and cause a lot of trouble."

Stayed one night","Being stuck with loud, snoring roommates is one of the huge downsides you've got to consider if booking this place. It was unbearable to the point where I simply left and requested to switched rooms. But low and behold, the replacement room is just as bad with the HVAC rattling repetitively at sequential 30 minute intervals that will for sure wake you every 30 minutes. Could not get a good nights rest at this place and I think it would have been far better to just fork over the extra cash for a proper, single, private hotel room. Losing sleep over a few dollars isn't worth it."

Stayed one night",I stayed for two nights with a checkout in between so really two separate stays. just to be clear it's a hostel. my first night was great quiet room easy to get along with people and a warm comfortable room nice shower everything was fine. I did a bit of a longer write-up for my second stay. there was nothing wrong with the place. because you stay in a room with multiple people keeping in mind that the location is very upscale. the Ritz-Carlton is not far from there and many other extremely expensive hotels. Rush Street and the magnificent Mile or Michigan avenue and even like millennium Park these are not far at all they're like right there. my second night I encountered kind of a crazy person or a person on drugs but they were happy to move me so I had a great rest of my night in the new room.

80% of the staff was helpful or friendly.
I so happen to be there on a very cold day, the heater was not working. I was moved to another room but even though the heater was blowing , there was no way it got over 71.
The place is located a block away from the train and a nice market on the corner.
For what I paid, I give this place 7 out of 10. Would I stay here again??? yes I would because I am more aware and able to adapt."

Stayed a few nights","The location is very good, there are restaurants, shops and points of interest nearby. The place is clean and the staff is friendly, the price is very good. If you don't mind sharing a room with strangers, I highly recommend it. I say this because you never know what kind of people I might have to share a room with.
I still had an issue (it's not entirely the fault of the place but they should prohibit the use of alcohol/cigarette inside to prevent these behaviors): I had to ask for a change of rooms since one of my colleagues was drunk (I don't know if drugged) when returning to the room. He was very crowded to cigarettes, his stuff was thrown around the room, and he started insulting me for no reason, thankfully he didn't physically assault me, but he did give me a lot of fear, more because the room is very small. The staff kindly agreed to change my room and my new colleagues were super friendly thankfully."

Stayed a few nights","The bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever been in. The bathroom and work area also exceeded my expectations. However, one of the roommates was really drunk and snoring loudly, making my stay a bit dangerous"

Stayed one night","Location is great, for price it is a good deal. But, there was no air circulation in the room AT ALL. There was one AC at the entrance and thats it, basically no ventilation in bathroom either, shower curtains were moldy, it is too small space for 4 people to fit in, if you are looking for helthier place to stay at please go somewhere else or get your own room, this was not worth it."

Stayed a few nights",I was staying at Chicago for New Years and this is a great option very worth the price you’re paying! The dorms are very well maintained and had everything I needed during my stay. Also a great shoutout to the team they have at the front desk and maintenance.

Stayed one night","Overall a good stay, however the lamp near my bed wasn't working. Also they only give you one small towel and there are no locks on the cabinets (which is not good when you're sharing a room with up to 3 other people)."
