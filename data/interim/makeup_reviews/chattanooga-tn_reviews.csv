Stayed one night","There is a known consistent difficulty in using smart phone GPS to find the ""tiny cabin"", so much so that they expect a call when people are looking for them. Apparently the address is not consistently present in databases. Once found it is well worth the extra effort. Though it is on the edge of town, it feels very remote and quiet. The backyard is a serene refuge with a beautiful waterfall. The cabin was comfortable with all promised appointments."

Stayed one night","The tiny cabin was a beautiful little dream. The property is stunning, tucked away at the top of the hill and St. Elmo is the cutest stretch of road with restaurants and shops. While it was wonderful, it is tucked away in the trees so some bugs got in at night. Just something to be aware of. Overall, amazing little getaway!"

Stayed a few nights","My boyfriend & I wanted to stay at a quiet & peaceful location. We couldn’t have found a better little cabin and at such a great price. The directions to the cabin were clear and it was very easy to find. I’m telling you, the pictures don’t do this place justice. Yes it’s in the backyard of a main house but it’s not close to the house at all! It’s nestled back in the trees with a bonfire area (which is shared with the main house guests) and very peaceful. If you didn’t read, there is a waterfall in the very back of the property. We loved it back there. The cabin it’s self is very clean and I loved the bathroom. The bed is definitely big enough for 2 people. There’s a microwave & mini fridge to store snacks. We didn’t need any more space than what the tiny cabin has so it was perfect. It’s a very easy drive into town and Ruby Falls Rock City were only about a 10 minute drive. All in all it was a 10/10 definitely recommend trip. I would give them a thousand stars if I could. Thank ya’ll!"

Stayed a few nights","Staying here was a splurge for me, but it was wonderful. The space was so beautiful itself, and its location even more so. The hosts gave the perfect of information about staying in a somewhat hidden-away place, sending a message before arrival and having a book in the room with everything needed, including how to use the coffee machine and find the trailheads with a hand-drawn map. A lot of care could be felt! I walked and used the bus to access the cabin and surroundings, and while the walk is a bit steep and tiring with a bag, it's totally doable and well worth it! (The 15 bus is free, too, which I didn't realize until arrival.) There is so much walking/hiking you can do, and it's gorgeous. There was a big storm one of the nights, and this meant seeing the waterfall with many different kinds of flows. You will always hear it rushing, and can see it from the front door. A really spectacular place to have access to - I only wish I could have stayed longer--the bed is SO comfortable!"

Stayed a few nights","Pictures can't even begin to do justice to the beauty of this spot. This is a unicorn property even among all the other dream homes on the mountain. You can hear the waterfall 24/7, which brings serenity to each moment. The terraced yard is a great place to just take in nature with views everywhere you look. The trailhead up Lookout Mountain is literally steps from the cabin, yet still miraculously private. The cabin is rustic and cool, with everything a couple could need for a peaceful respite. We had a wonderful fire in the wood stove while streaming NHL games directly to the roku TV from my phone with ease. It's just 2 miles to everything St. Elmo's has to offer, but feels truly hidden away in the woods. Joanna is a very friendly and pleasant host, and you can easily see her pride of ownership in all the details. My only regret is that we only had 2 nights to escape reality. I hope we have an opportunity to return soon."

Stayed a few nights","I truly enjoyed this cozy little cabin. The space was clean and welcoming, the bed was comfortable, the shower had great water pressure, and the little kitchen had all the basics. I am a coffee lover, I’m rather particular about my coffee routine and was pleasantly surprised with the quality coffee, grinder, French press and handmade mugs. My favorite part of the stay was the beautiful natural landscape, yet so close to town. I arrived at night and the cabin had good outdoor lights and it was easy to make my way down to it. Keep in mind that it’s a slightly downhill walk and the path isn’t completely even which is fine with me but for some with mobility issues it might not be.
I hope to return to the area and stay here again:)"

The place was completely updated and clean super awesome for a couple."

The cabin is rustic and chic at the same time. It's small but had everything we needed. We loved the wood-burning stove!
The location is great! Chattanooga is so close. You can get a woodsy nature experience and a city experience all in one trip.
Overall, we would recommend it to any solos or couples looking for a getaway in the mountains! We will be back!"

The only knock I’ll give was that the shower water didn’t stay hot for more than 5 minutes and then after that it was to freezing cold. Other than that, would definitely come back!"

Stayed a few nights","I really enjoyed my stay in this cozy cabin. The environment was relaxing and inviting. I had everything I needed to get through the day and they even had included popcorn, coffee maker, and an induction cooktop which I used several times. The scenery was excellent, you can hear the creek flowing from inside the cabin.
The biggest con is the hot water runs out very quickly, I was out of hot water in less than 10 minutes in the shower. I highly recommend to the owners to either upgrade to an instant hot water heater or swap out the shower head for something more water efficient. If there were to be 2 guest's staying in the cabin, they would definitely have to shower a good amount of time apart.
I didn't care for the coffee they had on hand, but it was nice that it was there. I ended up bringing my own grounds because their's was too acidic.
Overall, I highly recommend this cabin especially for the price. Very affordable compared to other options in the area."

You can hear the water stream flow right at the door and you’d enjoy a coffee on the deck for sure"

The cabin heats up nicely and stayed warm through the night. Joanna was especially helpful with passing road condition updates to us, as we traveled just after a snow and ice storm. The road to the cabin seemed daunting but getting the road and weather report from Joanna made us feel so comfortable driving it. We really are very grateful to the host and certainly would like to visit again."

The bed was comfortable, the kitchenette had enough space for what we needed, and the bathroom was surprisingly nice and updated, with big shelves for storage. The pictures don’t do the wood justice, it’s absolutely gorgeous. It rained during our stay and we woke up the next morning to a roaring stream tumbling through the rocks below, absolutely beautiful! I was worried about it being too cold, but the heating and cooling unit was perfect and we were very comfortable. If you stay here definitely try Nic & Normans, that was our fave spot we ate at!"

Nice little ""suite"" cabin. Small kitchenette space had everything we needed! The shower was awesome, and the bed was 'just right'.
You would think you are a million miles from nowhere, nestled in a beautiful mountainside hide away. In reality, everything we wanted to do was 10 to 15 minutes away. And we never got on the interstate!
(Notice anyone with mobility issues:
The ascent/descent path (& stairs) from parking to cabin door are a little steep, made of stepping stones, and about 75 feet away).
Hosts were quick to reply. Will stay again, SOON!."

Great location, amazing nature scenery, and a charming cozy cabin vibe."

It was secluded and calming while also being a quick drive to St. Elmo. We hiked the Glenn Falls trail around the corner (although we missed the blue flags to mark the trailhead at first) and it was an easy drive to Cloudland Canyon. The Cabin was even cuter than the pictures. I absolutely loved the little kitchenette. Plus, they had a French press and coffee at the ready. Perfect. I was surprised by how efficient the use of space was, especially in the bathroom; very smart design. The whole interior was comfortable and modern while also having an authentic cabin-in-the-woods feel. Will definitely be checking out the availability for this place when we return to the area."

They also have a binder for everything you would need to know about the airbnb from rules to the hiking map, even restaurant recommendations. I think my favorite part was seeing the fireflies everywhere. (I’m from south Florida we don’t get those) 100/10 would highly recommend staying here.

Kitchen and utensils were also very clean. The mini fridge worked great, along with the bathroom, shower and hot water. The host left more than enough supplies for a nice stay. The tv has Netflix and Amazon prime. The cabin is located in the perfect area, close to EVERYTHING! You can’t walk downtown but it most restaurants will comp your parking.

It was such a treat to be able to enjoy this busy city and private nature in such a safe location. Even during the day, I found myself getting excited to come back to this Airbnb! I didn't have a busy itinerary, so I ended up spending a lot of time drinking lovely tea (water kettle and tea provided of course - Joanna thinks of everything!) sitting on the porch, and watching the water and trees move in a breathtaking backyard.
This place is perfect for any trip. Do you need to get downtown quick? Dude, you're basically already in downtown. Wanna be in nature? Dude, you're in it. The best experience.
I will visit again. Thank you"

Stayed a few nights","Joanna’s little cabin sits in the back of another air bnb property nestled between a rocky hillside and a very enjoyable waterfall. We were disappointed that we didn’t have time on this trip to take the recommended hike up to the top of the waterfall but the soothing sounds carried throughout the cabin and made for a nice location to take photos together. The nearby St Elmo historic district provided quick access to stores, gas, restaurants, and tourist attractions. The bedding, bathroom, kitchenette, etc were more than adequate. As expected you will be dealing with bugs because of the location, though we were surprised to find a small scorpion in the kitchen sink. Turns out these are common in TN so be aware, our piece of advice regarding the bugs is to leave the outside lights off at night, otherwise they swarm the door and easily get inside. We enjoyed our stay so much, and ran into so many things we needed more time to do, we hope we can visit again in the future."

There are a few good restaurants nearby as well which made it easy to grab a bite. There is also a nice looking playground about 5 mins from the house.

The bedrooms and bathrooms are located to the right of the main rooms and each bedroom has a tv. An extra closet in the rooms with the twin beds has luggage stands available for use. There were k cups, creamer and sugar in the kitchen which was such a thoughtful touch! We loved the two decks where you could enjoy your cup of coffee and listen to the cascading creek below.
Located in the St Elmo neighborhood of Chattanooga, this was a fantastic spot for exploring Lookout Mountain, the Chickamauga Battlefield and the downtown river district. I'd definitely stay here again!"

Stayed with kids","We are frequent travelers and this was by far our favorite stay! I selected that the images were accurate, but they really do not do the beauty justice, as you cannot possibly capture how beautiful it truly is! You could hear the waterfall with the doors shut and curtains pulled (which we LOVED), it is a very private and peaceful location, everything on the inside was super clean and smelled fresh, the decorations were so simple but spoke volumes, Joanna was a very responsive and amazing host, and our daughter loved running around the yard. We felt right at home from the moment we walked in the door. We have zero complaints and hope to be back!"

Stayed with kids","Joanna’s place is INCREDIBLE! The backyard alone makes this place a true gem. Opening the back door and letting in the fresh air, listening to the birds and the water flowing over the rocks out back… WOW!
Best of both worlds. Peaceful at the house but still within minutes of so much of the fun Chattanooga has to offer. Would much prefer this to staying somewhere in the city. Can’t beat the serenity of being so secluded.
Would really recommend the Glen Falls hike they have mapped out in the host book! Just walk out the front door and twenty minutes later you’re scrambling over waterfalls.
House itself is great. Two bathrooms is a plus. Perfect for our family of five. Kitchen is well-stocked with dishes, utensils and cookware. Beds are cozy!
We were sad to leave but would love to stay again some time soon!"

Stayed with kids","This was the perfect getaway for our family. The home is located on a beautiful mountainside (with a waterfall in the backyard !!!) that feels remote yet is just a few minutes from city life. St. Elmo is a cool area with lots to do. We could have just hung out at the home the whole time, but Chattanooga's attractions are 5-star family fun- Rock City, the aquarium, the Discovery museum, the incline railway... all are a ton of fun. Go ahead and book this place! You will love it.
PS- visit the Amani/ Livingstone Coffee shop that Joanna and her family operate. The coffee is amazing, the shop is really cool, and the story of offering peace and empowerment to women in Africa is powerful."

But hearing the water from the bedroom window was so relaxing after all the hiking and things Chattanooga has to offer. Almost everything we did was only like 15 min no matter what it was. Ruby Falls, Rock City, downtown. Listing details were spot on so read them and enjoy your stay."

Stayed with kids","This home was a delight to stay in, and is a hidden gem, for sure! The hosts have added a number of personal touches to make your stay cozy and homey. We thought the beds and linens were very comfortable, and liked that they had memory foam mattresses instead of spring ones. Pictures don’t do it justice how beautiful the waterfall behind the house is, and the sounds of it from the back porch are heavenly! If you love to hike, you must take the trail to Glen Falls, which is about a 2.5 mi. out & back trek. There’s a multilevel waterfall at the very top that’s breathtaking. You can get there from a trail directly from the house and not have to take your car. It was the highlight of our trip! We’d definitely stay here again! Thank you! :)
(Traveler’s tip: if you can help it, I’d recommend not arriving after dark. There isn’t lighting around the parking area, and we found it difficult to park and get all of our luggage inside in the dark. If you arrive during daylight, it’d be better!)"

Stayed a few nights","Our Stay at Glenn Falls Cabin was awesome. Its got the best of both worlds....the peacefulness and quiet seclusion of a cabin in the woods, yet its only minutes to restaurants and local areas and only 10-15 to downtown and the attractions. The backyard and nature around the house is one of the best parts. When we arrived the fridge was stocked with a pizza in the freezer and milk, juice and condiments that we might need in the fridge. Joanna texted our next morning to make sure we had arrived and had everything we needed. We really enjoyed the mini Amani shop in the closet where we could further support a great organization. The beds were extra comfy and we had great nights sleep. We had a wonderful time and hope to come back in the warmer months so that we can enjoy the fire pit and nature trails."

The extra food was much appreciated as we were able to cook all of our meals in due to being “snowed in”. The fire pit is great and trails behind the house were awesome. Thanks for the great communication and amazing hospitality!

Stayed about a week","Thank you so much for hosting us. This home was perfect for our needs. We loved the natural lighting within the home, the spacious and private backyard with large waterfall and creek and the access to trails just off the property. Joanna and Pete were quick to answer our text messages when we sent them a question. We appreciate the allowance of well behaved dogs. This was our first time traveling with our dogs and we were so happy to find such a nice place to stay and be able to bring them with us. The home was tidy and the St. Elmo location was perfect for us. It's not too far of a drive to downtown Chattanooga or the coffee, ice cream and restaurants in historic St. Elmo.
We recommend making the time to eat at Community Pie pizzeria, the Cupcake Kitchen for incredible desserts, the Flying Squirrel for excellent cocktails, large beer selection and food (18+ establishment) and St. John's for fine dining. We also loved Clumpies Ice Cream at Coolridge park, the Hot Chocolatier (across from the Choo Choo downtown), Main Street Meats and Neidlov's bakery. There is so much great food in Chattanooga! There is also a Clumpies in St. Elmo but we did not visit that location.
One of our best memories was going to Rock City on a weekday. This home is located very close to Rock City so make sure that you make plans to visit this iconic site. We virtually had the park to ourselves as it was very cold and thick with fog. While you cannot ""See Seven States"" (a look out point that the park is known for) in the fog, the thick fog lent the most magical atmosphere to the large waterfall, incredible rock formations and caverns that we will not soon forget.
This rental was fantastic and affordable and we would very much like to stay here again in the future. Recommended!"

We enjoyed a night of s’mores by the fire pit and morning breakfast overlooking the woods.
The house has everything to make you feel right at home and close to local attractions.
Joanna was quick to respond to any questions and is close by if we needed anything.
I will definitely be booking again in the future."

The house was incredibly clean and comfortable. The heat has a slight problem keeping up or first night because of the bitter cold. Joanna and Pete responding VERY fast to get it handled and make sure we were comfortable. :) We all loved the backyard the most. The view was lovely. We even saw deer! It was so fun having the fire pit and stream. My husband and kids roamed all over the place!!! I would highly recommend staying. You won’t regret it.

Stayed a few nights","There were so many little touches in the home and on the property that made it truly unique. My experience with any business that gives part of its proceeds to charity is that you tend to get a little less and pay a little more, and it is made up for by the good feeling you have for giving. However, this place far exceeded my expectations in so many ways. Great showers, incredible bed and pillows, totally stocked cabinets with very nice glasses, cups and silverware, with unexpected and very welcome food in the stocked fridge. Truly a wonderful time."

The cabin is much like a cottage, comfortable and homey.
The kitchen was very well stocked. A smart tv, extremely clean, large washer, lots of dishware in beautiful colors.
The decor is tastefully done and has a great flow.
The walk to Glen Falls was a favorite.
A great location. It is at the top of the road, a typical windy climb for the area.
We will be back."

The yard was perfect, and allowed for much needed down time between site-seeing. The location was central to everything - both Rock City/Ruby Falls and the downtown area with the Tennessee Aquarium, etc. We even made a day trip out to Cherokee National Forest. Wonderful place to stay, and hands down would recommend it to anyone vacationing in the Chattanooga area!"

Stayed with a pet","We came to Chattanooga for the UT Chattanooga graduation. Madison was very friendly and quick to respond. Unfortunately we had been hit in a pretty bad car wreck that had totaled our family vehicle a few days before we were to go and I had messaged her to see if we could cancel for a full refund despite it being past the time to receive that. She was not willing to accommodate which was unfortunate. We had to do some scrambling to borrow a vehicle that could fit our family. We found one and made the trip there but had to find someone to take care of our two dogs which we'd planned to bring.
Madison's house is in a cute neighborhood tucked away from the busyness. The house is really cute on the inside and accurately reflects how the photos look online. The location is great and close access to several stores as well as the university."

But I'm panicky and thought ""oh my gah I am going to have to text these people at midnight!"") Just make sure you know to turn the deadbolt after entering the code. And then, after I entered the house at such an hour, I didn't know which way to the bedroom. (even though it was well lit) Catlyn to the rescue! She knew ""oh gah..here's another one..let me help this dodo to their room."" *facepalm*

Pretty home, easy access to get in with keypad,easy to find your room. Nice open shelf for your fridge needs. First time ever using a sound machine that was interesting. no TV in the room was a plus for me. I enjoy spending time with my spouse without the TV present.
Loved that ! I happened to get a mini ""Jenga""
The day of our visit and that was fun to play on the nice little desk provided in room. Coffee in the morning 🌄 and a nice hot shower with shampoo and conditioner provided
All around a win.
Did I mention a pink room ? Loved it 😊
Big mirror in the room thats fancy.
If you enjoy simplicity this is the place for you.

The house is in great condition, with beautifully maintained original features like hardwood floors, crown molding, and period fixtures.
The room I stayed in was exceptionally comfortable, with a cozy bed, plush linens, and plenty of pillows. The room was well appointed with all the amenities you would need for a comfortable stay, including ample closet space, and a private bathroom. The room was also tastefully decorated and beautiful view of the neighborhood.
One of the best things about staying in Karen's home is its convenient location. Despite being located in a historic neighborhood, the house is only 10 minutes from the commercial heart of downtown Chattanooga. This makes it the perfect home base for exploring all that the city has to of"

This Airbnb is better than I thought, it was an experience beyond my expectations; I’ve been in many Airbnbs in several States here in the US and abroad (Paris, France and Athens, Greece), but this one is the best one of all of them, the very best one in all my travelings, everywhere.
Everything was extremely neat and clean, all their instructions were clear, the communication was great and the neighborhood 100% quiet… What else is there…?
There is nothing that comes to my mind to better this site: this is the perfect Airbnb “par excellence”
Highly recommended and I mean it.

Stayed a few nights","Exactly the stay we were wanting. The place was so safe, clean, quiet, and welcoming. It had everything we needed. However, the fiancé said she needed a bedroom mirror for getting ready - a standing mirror maybe and more couch pillows too, ha!
Other than that, it was perfect. The price per night was way affordable and the area was close to everything we wanted to visit (Incline, Rock City, and Ruby Falls).
Greg provided good restaurant recommendations and our hands down favorite is Milk and Honey for breakfast. The Korean Place, Volcano, was very good too for dinner. A cool place to eat lunch was the Purple Daisy.
The attractions were all close by as the apartment is in the Saint Elmo area with its own restaurants that were good too. The parking spot is right at the apartment. We walked to the shops, Incline, 1865, and the Purple Daisey.
We will return as we really like Chattanooga and are coming back for River Bend.
Greg, thanks so much. We’ll see you soon."

Stayed a few nights","It was a tough week before we left to go on vacation - a trip to the ER after a horrible bout of stomach flu led to a serious depletion of fluids and electrolytes. Until Sunday morning, we were undecided as to whether to go or, stay home. We decided to take a chance, thinking the worst that could happen is that we would just have to hang out at Greg’s place the entire time. That would not have been at all difficult to do as we had everything we needed to just chill and watch movies, read or, just enjoy the peace and quiet. Greg gave great directions and instructions on getting into his place. It was absolutely wonderful with all of the comforts of home - a comfy bed, great shower and books to read.
Fortunately, the next day, I felt much better! We took it easy, rode the incline, drove up Lookout Mountain and had an early evening. Greg’s recommendations for food were great - loved the Purple Daisy and Tony’s Pasta Shop. We had a great stay and would definitely stay here again! Thanks!"

Stayed with kids","10/10 would stay again! The apartment itself was clean, spacious, and very comfortable. And the location was even more walkable than I expected! Just a few minutes stroll to restaurants, bars, ice cream, and Incline Railway. The drive up to Ruby Falls and Rock City was also super convenient. And Greg's food/drink suggestions were so great, we changed a couple of our plans to check them out. Glad we did!"

Greg is a very nice host, always gracious if there is a question or need for any help. St. Elmo is a nice area of Chattanooga. I love the nature around there. There is a bike station nearby and you can quickly get to the Riverwalk bike trail. There are also numerous hiking trails on Lookout Mountain walking distance from this home. Had a great experience once again and will stay here again if we have the chance to come back to Chattanooga. It's a great city, with lots to do, wonderful restaurants, history and culture. There is even a Clumpies, ice cream salon a 5-minute walk away. There are two grocery stores nearby, a pharmacy. Really pretty much all you need. Greg is a super host in my book!"

Stayed a few nights","Greg was great! Very responsive and gave us recommendations to do while we stayed. He even went out of his way for me to search for local restaurants I could safely eat at with celiac disease. VERY clean, safe spot. I never once felt unsafe and felt right at home, probably best nights sleep I’ve had & comfy bed. Only cons I had were I wish the bathroom had a hook on the back of the door for a toiletries bag and that the shower had more pressure to it. But hot water was amazing! Overall a pretty quiet place except the slamming of doors often during the day and the garage door opening and closing quite a few times; unsure if this was due to the house attached or a neighboring house. Place is VERY centrally located to a lot; Publix, Walmart, lookout Mountain, the zoo, Aquarium, Hunters art museum etc.
Would definitely recommend anyone to stay at Greg’s place and would return!"

The neighborhood of St. Elms is also super cute with a coffee shop, brewery and ice cream walking distance away from his place. Greg is always accessible and responsive to any needs we may have. This spot always makes for a great stay in Chattanooga and would highly recommend to anyone making a trip out there."

He gave us a run down of how things worked in the space. He respected our privacy but always made sure we had what we needed. The apartment is super comfortable and the amenities were top notch. They definitely took the time to make it feel like a home away from home. Greg had many suggestions and seems to have a wealth of knowledge of the city as well as the neighborhood. The fact that we could easily get to attractions like the incline train without having to look for parking was a huge plus.

Stayed a few nights","Everything was amazing, exactly how it was described! His communication was great, he met us there and gave us some info about the neighborhood and came in and just have us a little run down and how to use things. He told us if we needed anything to just send him a text or call. He even checked in to see if we needed more coffee because he knew it was low before we got there, and thanked him for checking in. He sent me a list of some local places to eat at when I asked him if he could and was quick about it which was awesome! Would definitely recommend his place a d whenever we are back in the area and his place is free we would love to stay there again! Thank you Greg for opening your home to my family, we enjoyed everything aout it!"

Greg welcomed us and told us about his place and the area. We walked to dinner and dessert. We drove to sunset rock(the BEST view) which was very close. We parked for free behind Cravens house and walked 20-30min to the overlook. I highly recommend staying here, we wish we could’ve stayed longer!"

Stayed a few nights","Absolutely a hidden gem!
The place itself was clean and perfect for 2! It included a kitchen with a fridge, dishwasher, oven, convection oven, coffee pot, and microwave. Cute sitting area for watching tv and a large, extremely comfortable bed, best sleep I’ve had in a while!
The location: where do I begin! The house was nestled right on the base of the mountain. A short walk to downtown where there was a few restaurants, ice cream shops, coffee shops, and even some art shops. You could view the Incline from the window and a short walk would get you to the main station! A 2-3 minute drive brought you to a grocery store and a 5 minute drive took you to more restaurants as well as a Publix.
Entertainment: this was the PERFECT spot for us! A short drive up the mountain lead us to Ruby Falls and Rock City. Further up the mountain was a civil war battleground, Covenant College, and some hiking trails.We also took a day trip and went downtown to the Aquarium and the Chattanooga Zoo. This is the perfect getaway for a couple or small family as all the entertainment was within 20 minutes.
The hosts: AMAZING! The host met us upon arrival and gave us a walkthrough of the space as well as gave us several places to eat and some must-sees. They even went above and beyond when we went for a walk with some unexpected rain, and they let us borrow their umbrella!
This was the best getaway experience I’ve ever had and highly recommend this rental!"

The location is an up and coming area with a hip, cool vibe..., but be advised, the neighborhood has a mix of newer homes, run down homes, and some remodeled homes. It is the older, historic section of Chattanooga. Not trying to be negative, because we enjoyed our stay, but want others to know what to expect.
Wish Greg the best in his AirBnB venture!"

Stayed with kids","We had a great stay at this unique loft in a vibrant part of town. Curt was extremely responsive and friendly, and he even left us some delicious pastries for breakfast and a bottle of wine to welcome us—such a nice touch!
There were a couple of unexpected noise issues: the building is close to a fire station, and there was a constant drone from a nearby ventilation system. However, Curt thoughtfully provided a white noise machine, which helped a lot.
One other surprise was a strong manure/agricultural smell outside, which discouraged us from exploring the neighborhood as we had planned. We only stayed for one night, so this could be an unusual occurrence.
Overall, the loft itself was lovely and well-appointed, and Curt’s hospitality made our stay enjoyable despite the minor inconveniences."

The art is fun, the kitchen beautiful, and the plants homey. Little unreal birds are stationed throughout in a quirky manner. Upon arrival, we are greeted with a birthday cupcake for my husband’s 50th, cookies, wine, flowers, and a personal note. There’s an abundance of coffee and local recommendations. We enjoy walking to several delightful restaurants and even have groceries delivered through Instacart. The shower is fantastic and the bed comfy. The only noise we hear mid-week is the train that I find quite charming. We have a toilet issue, and Curt is here in minutes to fix it - problem solved. It’s expensive to stay in a place like this, but it makes for an unforgettable special occasion."

One thing to know is that the loft is very susceptible to outside noise… and that is out of the host’s control, obviously. The building is between a fire station and a food shipping center, which both produce a lot of noise at all hours of the night. The noise is the only reason I wouldn’t give the place 5stars across the board."

The beds were comfy. We didn’t cook but the kitchen was spacious and well decorated. Second, we had everything we needed to be comfy. The couch and games and TV were all perfect for families. Their laundry machine wasn’t working but Alex offered to get my clothes and wash them and she even folded them for me (I was pleasantly surprised!) they were wonderful hosts. The location was great too - with a bakery a stone’s throw away that had amazing croissants and coffee. The only thing to be aware of is that the flat is located on the 3rd floor. It was fine for us and we could use the exercise - it was fine for my 2 kids as well who are 5 and 7. But good to be aware. I highly recommend this loft and would love to stay there again!"

Stayed a few nights",Three girlfriends and I spent 2 nights at Alex & Curt's loft on a golf getaway. Plenty of beds/sleeping areas. The loft is beautifully decorated and the hosts had left some delicious pastries for us along with a bottle of wine. We walked to dinner one night and cooked in the other. Loft was convenient to interstate but also restaurants and bars. We didn't get a chance to try the self-serve bar downstairs but it looked fun with patrons playing games on Sunday afternoon when we arrived. We had to contact the hosts a few times for clarification and they always responded quickly. Will definitely stay there again.

We could walk to great restaurants and loved the neighborhood. Street parking was fine. A little building noise at night which didn't bother me but did affect my teenage daughter, however we would both stay there again in a heartbeat. They gave us perfect suggestions to satisfy my daughter's vintage binging and other cool things to do. Only regret is we couldn't stay longer."

Stayed with kids","I've stayed in a lot of Airbnb's and Alex & Curt's loft apartment in Chattanooga is the nicest one so far. It is beautifully and comfortably decorated and includes lots of amenities. A complimentary bottle of wine and fresh baked cookies greeted us on arrival along with a personal welcoming note from Alex & Curt. They also provided excellent recommendations for local restaurants and things to do. The kitchen was well stocked and even included a Keurig coffee maker that could also make lattes and cappuccinos. The bedrooms were large - the master with two queen beds is enormous - and comfortable. The apartment was also very clean. It is on the third floor of a building that includes a restaurant and bar on the ground floor but we never heard any noise from that business. You can reach the apartment using the stairs in the front of the building or the elevator in the rear of the building, both entrances accessible only with a keypad lock."

Stayed a few nights","The condo was immaculate, the decor was gorgeous, and the beds and sofa were extremely comfortable. There were muffins and a bottle of wine waiting upon our arrival. If you have fantasized about living in a hip downtown loft, this is your place. Personally I loved it, but my business partner was not sold for the following reasons.
The directions from Alex and Curt were very good, but without reading them in detail you will never find this place. And because the condo is located over a bar, it was a bit disconcerting for her to arrive alone in the dark and have to walk behind the unit to access the elevator entrance to take up the suitcases. Finally, the unit is across from a fire station and near train tracks. There was loud music playing after midnight on the patio next door both nights, and between that and the trains and the fire trucks it was too noisy for any light sleeper.
I sleep like the dead with my headphones, like the city, so I would definitely come back!"

Alex & Curt were very responsive and went above and beyond to provide local recommendations and left us some yummy cookies, fresh peaches and a handwritten note upon arrival. Everything was as pictured and we thoroughly enjoyed. On the weekends, there are some bars close that play loud music at night—it was fine for a group like ours but something to consider about the area if your group would be easily bothered by something like that."

We were so happy to be staying in a walkable neighborhood with so many great restaurants, like Taqueria Jalisca Ania and Flying Squirrel, both of which were suggestions from Alex & Curt.

We were able to walk to dinner one night and walk to brunch one morning. My only complaint is that we couldn't stay longer but hoping to come back!"

It is a third floor apartment but the service elevator allowed easy access for shlepping luggage up to the apartment. Only negative is that it is across the street from a fire station. So some of the nights, we had sirens going off that occasionally interrupted sleep. Bring earplugs. Could not have asked for a better place to stay. I would definitely rent this one again, sirens or no sirens!!!!!!"

We felt so spoiled 🥺💓 The welcome book had literally every single thing you could want to know about the loft & then some, plus good eats in the area. The beds were so comfortable. The towels were super soft and smelt great. The back entrance with the elevator was such a nice addition and so helpful when it came to loading and unloading our stuff. The area of town couldn’t have been better. We had such an incredible time . We came for my boyfriend’s 30th birthday but we both felt so special . If you are considering booking this loft, DO IT.

Stayed with kids","Don’t look for a Chattanooga spot for another second - this is, by far, one of the best spots we’ve stayed in!
Pros:
-GORGEOUS and large apartment! So beautifully decorated, awesome industrial vibe but still super cozy, fantastic location and packed with amenities!
-Super clean - and we’re fanatic about this.
-Fantastic welcome book packed with great advice about the apartment, dining and things to do.
-Great communication from super welcoming hosts!
Location:
-We walked for 2-3m and ate dinner at State of Confusion (try the steak chimi - SO good). Tons of other great restaurants on the street. Loved how walkable this was. -Great parking right outside.
Amenities:
-Living/Dining: our favorite spot with too much to count, but our favorites were the games, books, and coziest fireplace/couch/blankets. Great viewing options of smart TV with various apps available.
-Kitchen is super well stocked with all the tools, dishes, glasses, spices and a water pitcher. Great variety of coffee pods. Super cute welcome note & amenity upon arrival.
-Bathrooms all have super plush towels, pump hand soaps and wall pumps for shampoo/conditioner/body wash. Showers were very good also. And the toilet paper was A+ — you know this is a big deal! ;)
-Bedrooms all have the heavenliest mattresses (and we are super picky), noise machines, ear plugs, luggage rack, and ample storage. You can also find a box fan in the second bedroom.
Tips:
-Bring a laundry bag for things with strings or delicates so they don’t get tangled.
-Lots of stairs so note the use of the service elevator in the back of the building if accessibility is a factor.
-Bring creamer and sugar for your coffee!
-Don’t sleep on finding the little hidden faux woodland creatures in the nooks of the brick. My kids LOVED spotting them all!
Overall, fantastic, A++ stay! Thanks, Alex & Curt!"

To get to the aquarium area, we caught the free electric shuttle leaving from the charge station on Market Street (next to the Choo-Choo) since we had a little one with us this time, and that worked out great! But there’s also a bike station right at the corner, if you prefer getting around with some exercise on your travels. I’d stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","Look no further! We LOVED our experience at Alex & Curt’s Stylish Loft! Let’s break it down….
1. Location! Right in the heart of Southside, walking distance to great spots like Stir, State of Confusion and Niedlov!
2. Communication! Alex & Curt made themselves available if we needed anything, offered suggestions of places to go and even had some muffins and coffee for us! Great manual and all instructions were easy to follow!
3. Style! This renovated Loft has so much character. The interior brick, the original beams, the high ceiling, natural light, velvet furniture…we loved it! We played games one night and savored our environment.
Definitely 5 star! Go enjoy!!"

Hosts were responsive and kind. Welcomed with homemade cookies (big hit with the teens) and a bottle of wine (big hit with me!). Hosts have created a book with detailed information about all that Chattanooga has to offer. One of our best Airbnb experiences to date. We highly recommend!"

Once you open the door you know you are welcomed home. It is an old home in an old neighborhood. I don't know the history of the home but I am happy that it was lovingly restored and available for someone like me to appreciate. Though I did not use the backyard it is a nice spot to unwind and relax. I enjoyed an invigorating mile plus walk in the neighborhood. I hope the De'Vine Home will be available the next time I visit Chattanooga. My only regret is that my stay at the De'Vine Home was not long enough.

Stayed a few nights","“De’Vine Home - five minutes from downtown” is the heading for this property, which greatly appealed to me, and sold me. We soon realized after arriving this home was located 15-20 minutes from downtown and also situated on the corner of a busy traffic street in a rough neighborhood. The house itself is old but very neat and clean. It looks to have been updated in the past 10 years. Throughout the night you can hear loud boom boxes from passing cars on the busy street. Also the rusted grill in the backyard has no accompanying utensils, and is basically unusable. Also, the pillows offered are very hard. We want people to know the heading for this property is very misleading. Five minutes from downtown is false advertising. Also, in the instructions we were given Anita’s name and telephone number to contact prior to arriving and during our stay. In our experience Anita does not respond to voicemail or text. We could only get a response from her through Airbnb."

There was even a basket of snacks provided. Kitchen was well equipped and even coffee and tea was provided. The rooms were very nicely decorated, we felt very much at home. There were also plenty of towels available in the two bathrooms. The only point we didn't like so much was the location of the house right from a busy street. So you don't have absolute tranquility on the porch. But I have to mention that there was peace at night. We were also not in the garden as the fence was not completely closed and could have easily entered the property uninvited guests. Otherwise, the location of the house is perfect for Cincinnati and nature (e.g. Lookout Mountain)."

Stayed a few nights","Anita's place is in a good location to get out and explore. It is close to downtown Chattanooga, the shops in east ridge and to Chickamauga Parks. Orchard Knob is right down the street and even if the weather does not allow you to get out and climb the hill, the drive around is worth it. I did not have much reason to reach out to Anita, but when I did, she responded within minutes."

The only minor concern my group had was the use of the AC unit. It did not seem like we had control over the temperature in mid summer so being able to change it during the day and night and not having to reach out would have been easier. However, the place was beautiful, worth the trip, and I would recommend this."

There was a smorgasbord of snacks in the kitchen and bottled water in the fridge. Each room had fans, ear plugs, and sound machines - although we didn't think the property was loud. The porch was super nice and chill. Everything we wanted to do was 10-15 minutes away (downtown, shopping, Ruby Falls, aquarium, zoo). We had no issues with Lyft finding the location. Check-in was super easy, and I loved that the check-out process was just as easy. I didn't have to strip all of the beds - so it felt more like a vacation than other places I've stayed. Anita did a great job of including the simple things to make our stay as comfortable as possible! Would stay here again!"

I don't think the pictures really do the house justice, partly because the rooms seemed larger in person than in the pictures. It was an easy place to relax in right away. We found the couch and beds to be comfortable and there were even cushion rails provided so I didn't have to worry about my young children rolling off the bed. Plenty of snacks and coffee were provided and there were plenty of toys my kids enjoyed playing with. On top of it all. Anita was great! she was very easy to communicate with and always responded quickly. She was also kind enough to check up on us during our stay. We didn't have any problems while we were at the house and we found the location to be very convenient. We could get downtown in under 10 minutes and to Lookout Mountain in about 15.

We made s’mores on the last night…the fire pit. There were games in the tv room. We played an intense game of sorry LOL We did venture out, house was 15ish minutes from where we needed to be. I drank coffee on the front porch both mornings, Anita even had kcups available! I can go on and on. We booked on Tuesday and by Wednesday we were reconnecting and laughing as a family.

Stayed with kids","I love Anita’s place. It is close to everywhere we wanted to visit. It was very clean and beds were very comfortable. You can tell she’s very thoughtful. There were board games, toys, magazines, books, Water, coffee and creamers, and more. The shower was nice and hot. The towels and linen smelled so good. It was a great experience and we will def come back!! :)"

Stayed a few nights","A girlfriend and I spent several days at Anita’s house, using Chattanooga as a base for hiking and exploring. Anita was a top notch host - the house was well-equipped with everything we needed and more, the beds were extremely comfortable, and the location was centrally located to both downtown and area parks for hiking. Checking in and out was a breeze. If you are staying in the area, I highly recommend Anita’s lovely Air BNB."

Stayed with kids","We really enjoyed our stay at Anita’s place. She was very easy to communicate with and checked in with us to make sure we were enjoying our stay. We appreciated all of the extras, especially the ones for our kids (crib, high chair, toys, etc.). The house is a short 7-8 min drive to downtown. We didn’t feel like the neighborhood was walkable for our young family. Overall a very positive stay at Anita’s place."

Stayed one night","Anita has definitely earned the title SUPER HOST! I was traveling with my toddler and I forgot pull ups. I don’t know about you but I hate stopping my vacation for a store run. Needless to say our super host had our back. Also, when we couldn’t decide where to eat there were great suggestions in the handy notebook. Great stay!"

Stayed with kids","The house was very cute and fit our needs perfectly. It was very clean and well maintained. It was convenient in location to downtown as well as the various softball parks that my girls were playing at while there. We were within 15-20 minutes, and that's on the long end, of everywhere we needed to go. Anita was so quick to respond if I ever had a question. Beds were comfortable and there was plenty of room for my family. A nice touch was the platter with small snacks upon arrival that awaited us. We had everything we needed while there."

Stayed a few nights","Anita’s home was beautiful! Just the right size for me and my two friends to stay for two nights. Everything about the house was wonderful. The only thing was that the location of the home was slightly, slightly sketchy. The homes on our road were very nice, but being 3 young girls on this side of town gave me and my friends a small uneasy feeling. However, Anita has a ring doorbell to monitor any guests near the property. That set our minds at ease once in the house. Other than that small detail, the home was perfect."

The location is super, very close to downtown, River walk. Even though the house sits at the corner lot of two streets, it is still pretty quiet at night.
We appreciate everything and enjoyed our stay."

Anita's place felt comfortable immediately, and the furniture was not only impeccably clean, each piece was comfortable and inviting. My family and I will look to stay here every time we make our trip to Chattanooga for local hiking trails finished off with a day at aquarium and downtown Chat."

Stayed with kids","This home is minutes away from downtown. We were convenient to everything we wanted to visit in the area. The home is beautifully decorated. The host welcomed us with refreshments and water. She has everything you could possibly think of from book with recommendations, toys, games, toiletries (for those that may forget an item or 2), Keurig with the various K pods, baby items (crib, toddler bath chair, high chair). We had a 10month old so the baby toys, crib, baby toiletries came in handy. She had plenty of room to crawl freely. It is a family friendly home, and open floor plan with the kitchen and family room. The host is quick to respond when you communicate with her, and helpful. I would definitely stay here again."

Stayed a few nights",The house is very nice. It’s all been updated & is super cute. There were extra touches like snacks & water bottles left for us. The beds are comfortable. The shower in the master bathroom tiny so we chose to use the guest bath. The only negative is that neighbor is questionable.

Stayed with kids","My stay here was amazing. We came (family of 3) to celebrate my son turning 5. We were looking for something close to downtown because we wanted to go to the Creative Discovery Museum and the Aquarium. This place was perfect. It was so clean, the communication was excellent and it’s truly set up for a family. We initially only booked 1 night but enjoyed our stay so much decided to extend an extra day and Anita was quick to respond & give us an extension.
I come to Chattanooga a lot to work and I’d definitely stay here again. Truly a 10/10 experience."

The house was so charming and very clean. My daughter loved the play area and we even played with some of the games. She pretty much spend all her time there.
Love that the house was fully equipped with everything I needed, especially the crib was the best. The bed was so comfortable, clean and the whole house smelled really good.
Anita was fast to respond to my questions and very accommodating And very helpful.
I would definitely book here again when I come back to TN."

Lemon grass Thai was a great little restaurant that was 2 minute drive down the road. I was pleasantly surprised with how clean the property was kept, I had a little one that played in the yard and It was nice having the fenced in back yard. One little side note if you have young kids check for pesticides under the counters. I didn't notice them at first but they are hidden in the back.
I was happy with my stay and hope to stay again next time we are in Chattanooga. Thanks for always responding so quickly to all my needs!!!"
