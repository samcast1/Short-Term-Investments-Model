Stayed a few nights","Newly updated and well-appointed townhome in a quiet little development that made our stay convenient, comfortable, and enjoyable. Super comfy beds. Would definitely recommend and would stay again. My personal favorite was the guest login to streaming services which automatically logged us out at the end of the stay. I often stress about leaving myself logged in--especially now that streaming services want to crack down on multiple logins, and whatever feature Aubrey and Will use to automate the logouts made me leave that stress behind. The TV was quite large (which we loved) and we came home from an exhausting day and watched a movie in comfort. Thanks for hosting us!"

The bathrooms were clean with cute little amenities and the kitchen was well stocked for cooking. The beds were too plush for my taste and because I have a bad back, I lost a bit of sleep, but of course that’s a personal preference. It meant I could spend my mornings on the patio listening to the birds, it was a lovely little retreat. All in all, it was a pleasant stay."

The biggest factor for me when looking for a home to stay in is reading the reviews for a comfortable bed and tv’s in the bedrooms. The beds in this house are very very comfortable! Easy and accessible tv’s for streaming networks. It is a 5 minute drive to restaurants near by. Would recommend for a longer stay time frame also.

Stayed one night","Will and Aubrey are by far the kindest, most humble and gracious hosts I have ever interacted with on here. The place is in quiet part of the town, with great view of trees in the back yard. The house was clean and beautifully decorated without overwhelming the walls. I just couldn’t help but appreciate how much thought went into even the littlest of things.
I have airbnb-ied many places in Texas, but aggieland hospitality always takes my breath away! I wish I could give 6 stars"

Stayed with kids","Wonderful stay. Owners have the unit stocked with coffee, creamers, sweeteners, good linens, and plenty of silverware/cookware. Technology was great, two large Roku televisions to cast to with a smaller unit in the second bedroom and USB charging outlets in every room. Check-in was super easy and the unit was very easy to find via google maps. Convenient to almost any kind of food you may want but far enough off of University to not be too loud. Less than fifteen minutes from the A&M campus. Highly recommend and would absolutely return on further visits to College Station."

Place was simple but good, has what you need and tidy. Beds and bathrooms were tidy. Only thing was that there was leftover coffee grounds from the previous stay that had gone moldy, likely just looked over in the cleaning process. Neighborhood is down the street (5 min walk) from restaurants, gas station, and some stores and about 1.5 miles from campus. The surrounding neighborhood isn’t fancy, seemed like a normal suburb, slightly older brick style houses and quiet. I’d stay again!"

Super cute, even though its theme is for women. I was not a fan of the train that runs straight through the town. That has nothing to do with the property or the host and for the price it's a small inconvenience. Noise from anywhere and everywhere is expected in the center of town. I would definitely recommend to all my family, co-workers and friends that may need a place to stay while visiting Bryan-College Station.

Stayed a few nights","Exactly as pictured - super cute, bright, and colorful! We didn't spend much time here, but the beds were comfy, which is what mattered most to us. The location is definitely walkable into the downtown area for shopping and restaurants. If you're here on a weekend, plan to go eat early or you will wait well over an hour to be seated. We were in town for the game and took the shuttle to/from Kyle Field and would do it this way every time - they really have it down! Natalie was super quick to reply to anything we needed - thank you!"

Adorable…loved the artwork, cute kitchen, little colorful courtyard out back, very comfy beds, slept great! Nancy had thought of every detail you could need, appreciated the coffee and creamer, toothpaste, extra toilet paper, etc. Bryan had lots of cute lil restaurants to try while there…RX Pizza, Billy’s Grille & Bar, 3rd on Main are a few we tried….all walkable from Howdy House…place was clean, Nancy will certainly take care of you, she’s on top of her game you can tell…check in and out were a breeze, good instructions!! May want to grab a bag of ice if you want it during your stay, no ice maker, although good cold water available out of fridge dispenser…5-10 minute drive from A&M…Bryan is a quaint lil town, hated I didn’t get to snoop thru the antique shops while there….but maybe next time.

My 16 year old daughter was going to sleep in the twin bed at the top of the stairs but once she saw how big the master bed and the TV were she parked herself in bed with me! The shower was great. Huge fridge which held our big box of leftover pizza. Thanks for a great stay!

The decor was incredibly chic and stylish, with all the latest trends and design elements expertly curated throughout the home. The attention to detail was simply impeccable, with every corner of the space boasting an Insta-worthy backdrop.
Not only was the space beautiful, but it was also incredibly comfortable and functional. The beds were comfortable and cozy, the bathrooms were sparkling clean and stocked with all the necessary amenities, and the kitchen was fully equipped with all the appliances and tools you could ever need to whip up a delicious meal.
It really was the perfect blend of style, comfort, and functionality, and it made my stay a really great experience. The host was also great giving plenty of info from check in to local recommendations."

Everything in downtown Bryan was within walking distance and that was the best part of the stay if you ask me. Bryan is small town America at its best! The parking was convenient and there were spots right in front of the place. Check in and checkout was smooth with the keypad. College Station is a quick drive (10/15 mins) so you also get access to all of the things there. The entire trip I felt like I was at home and I didn’t want for anything. 12/10 would stay again 😊"

Stayed a few nights","One of the BEST Airbnb’s I’ve ever stayed in!! Came to town for my graduation from TAMU & my two girlfriends & I stayed here & loved it! Natalie was so responsive & the place itself was so cute & clean! We loved the space & everything that Natalie did to make sure our experience was perfect. She went as far as to provide toothpaste, razors, phone chargers, makeup remover towels, a steamer, waters, margaritas & lots of suggestions for things to do in town. The location was perfect because we love downtown Bryan and it also want too far from all of the College Station activities! Overall it was a perfect experience & we can’t wait to come back 💖"

The location was perfect for our needs. It was a 9 minute drive to our Messina Hof Winery event. It is close to coffee shops and a farmers market was right down the street. We look forward to our next stay and telling all our friends too."

Stayed over a week","This comfortable, convenient and clean unit is the perfect place to stay in College Station. It's exceptionally well appointed (its pictures don't do it justice), and the location could not be better for access to the university and all the best food options. As a researcher, I needed a quiet and unobtrusive space, and Chris was extremely accommodating and responsive in the rare instances we were in touch. Finally, climate control in the apartment is really excellent. During my first visit to College Station (when I stayed at a down market hotel that cost more than this place), I learned the hard way that good air conditioning is a must in the summer months. In five minutes, this airbnb cools down and the air circulation keeps it pleasant all night. Save yourself some time, money, and inconvenience and choose Chris's place. You'll be glad you did."

Stayed one night","Chris's place was absolutely perfect! The location is near everything I needed, convenience store, fast food, eating and drinking establishments, especially close to the University. When I walked in I felt welcomed and comfortable. It has so much for the space and I enjoyed the coziness.
The Airbnb was well supplied with coffee and snacks and I loved the colors on the bathroom mirror and the showerhead! What a sweet touch. The bed was so very comfy that I didn't even miss mine. Chris was great at communication during the process and assured me he was available if I needed anything.
I recommend this place to anyone wanting to stay in the Bryan/College Station area. There is everything you need within walking distance and sitting out front and watching the sunset is a nice touch.
Thanks Chris and I hope the next folks enjoy it as much as I did!"

We ended up needing to wash our clothes so it was very convenient to have the washer and dryer along with detergent and dryer sheets. It was super convenient to both Bryan and Texas A&M. And there was a Starbucks close by! Would definitely stay again. Thanks!!

Stayed with a pet","We were looking for places to stay while visiting TAMU for grad school orientation and came across this Airbnb. The price was just right and it was much more homey and peaceful than a hotel would ever be. everything was clean and the place was just as described in photographs and maybe even a little bit better in person.
Victor was very communicative with us. He reached out before the stay started with all the necessary info. There was a water outage and when I got on my phone to reach out for help, Victor had already sent me a message advising that the city was working on the water and it would be back on in 2 hours. (This was clearly out of his control and not a major inconvenience).
definitely be looking to stay here again next time I'm in College Station."

Their place is one of my favorite AirBnBs I’ve stayed at because it was so comfortable; it didn’t feel as foreign as a hotel or as outlandish as some AirBnBs that have exaggerated decor. It had everything I needed and was so cozy I was reluctant to leave the next day! I’d highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","The cottage was just what I needed - quiet, private, clean, well furnished. The aroma was neutral - no smell of cleaners or artificial cover-up aerosols. The queen bed was good for one person (I'm 6 ft- 2 in tall). The couch and easy chair looked and felt new and comfortable. The air conditioner was quiet and worked well, although the room temperature was cooler than the AC setting. At a setting of 77 it felt like 73. The refrigerator had a leak being caught by a couple of towels, but that didn't really bother me, as only put a few drinks in it. Being able to park in the driveway, close to the gate, was a plus. Thanks for the hospitality."

Amenities included individual shampoo, conditioner, bar soap, and makeup remover wipes, just as you would see in a hotel, but in the comfort of a 2 bedroom condo. With a full bath and one half, and 2 king size beds, we had a lot of space to spread out for 2 12 year old girls, and a married couple. The complex is also very quiet which was great for downtime and sleep. The condo was immaculate with all the things you’d need for your stay at a home away from home. Victor is very quick to respond to any questions needed and even helped us change our reservation."

Stayed with a pet","The rental is certainly nice enough for a short stay, and I commend the owner for its cleanliness. The beds & linens were comfortable as well, and check in and check out were both very easy and nicely arranged, but this rental is a bit bare bones and awkward. While the owner could easily add packets of sugar and sweetener, and add trash cans to the bedrooms, the rest of the less-than-ideal aspects of this rental property are not as easily appeased by the owner.
It is not easy to traverse through the rooms on the first floor because of a strange step-up at the base of the stairs to the second floor that cuts the first floor in half (living room vs dining-kitchen-bathroom area). There is a half-bath downstairs, but it has no air vent for AC/heating, which means it is cold in the winter and hot in the summer. There were no hand towels in the downstairs half-bath, and no racks on which to hang any towels - though this was solved easily enough with a roll of paper towels from the kitchen. The upstairs full bath also lacks sufficient towel racks, though the owner has done what they can to add space for hanging towels outside of the upstairs bathroom. The ceiling fan in the Master Bedroom has only 1 actual speed= too fast, vs off. The chain has more pulls, suggesting you might be able to acquire more speeds by pulling the chain again, but in truth, the fan was either very fast or off. No medium or low speeds. There was one and only one trash can upstairs - in the bathroom shared by the two bedrooms. No trash cans in either bedroom, and thus no access to a trashcan when someone is in the bathroom. A neighbor allowed their little yippy dog to bark more than I cared for. The view of trees and birds out the eating area window was nice; the lawn in the back is crabgrass and weeds, not grass. It's a shared lawn, so again, the quality of the lawn is not something the rental owner can easily address.
Summary - appreciably clean, and relatively low cost to rent for the location, but it has an awkward floorplan and suffers from lower-end construction construction and property management issues (squeaky floors when people walk upstairs, odd step-up that divides the ground floor but saves space, weeds for lawn). Nice enough rental, and the owner has provided most (not quite all) of the conveniences I've come to expect from an Airbnb, but I'm glad I don't live long-term in this place with trip-hazard floorplan and cheap construction."

Stayed a few nights","Victor’s Townhouse is very nicely decorated with a French/Paris look to it. The home has comfortable furniture, especially the large leather sofa! He was very attentive to a few suggestions I mentioned (as I’m a super host as well), and his communication was quick! You might need to bring ice unless he adds an ice tray to make your own. That was a bit of a bummer to have to leave to go get ice after traveling. But I loved that he had Kleenex boxes through out the home! Not many Airbnb’s include that but I think it’s nice to have around. The only issue that I encountered, which was not Victor’s fault at all, was that there was a college party a few units down & it got pretty noisy one night so after an hour of watching this thing grow, I called the police to have to them break it up. Apparently it was a different Airbnb rental that had the party, which is illegal and against Airbnb’s policy so hopefully those people should get in trouble. You can’t control for those type of random scenarios that can happen anywhere especially in a college town but Victor was so responsive! After I called the police, he also drove over to the unit to make sure everything was handled and quiet again and it was late, well early am. I know it’s usually quiet in this area which is why I stayed here again so bad luck on my end but things happen. I would definitely stay here again!"

The privacy afforded to us was perfect, striking just the right balance between seclusion and warmth from our hosts. Ann and Rodney themselves could not have been more welcoming, always on hand to provide helpful advice and insights into the local area, making us feel right at home. Their incredibly sweet dog Olaf, instantly won our hearts. Her love for attention and playful spirit was a highlight of our stay, adding a joyful energy to the serene setting. The access to fresh chicken eggs and greens directly from their garden was a genuine treat, elevating our dining experiences and connecting us more deeply with nature. Every aspect of our stay, from the thoughtful touches in our accommodation to the natural beauty and the genuine kindness of Ann, Rodney, and Olaf, was truly appreciated.

The property was very well thought out as a stay with all the details covered. Even the small stuff. Instructions were there for everything and the host was not overbearing with a bunch of rules. Very laid back.

She met us upon arrival and answered every question both before and during our trip in a timely, friendly fashion. Ann's space was actually much bigger that we thought, housing all four of us comfortably with its two Murphy beds. We spent the majority of our time hanging out on the big shady porch, listening to the birds sing and watching the chickens hunt and peck in the nearby side yard. Olaf, Ann's lovable canine companion, was a welcome addition to our group. The highlight, though, was the backyard wood-fired pizza oven. WORTH THE EFFORT...our pizzas were fabulous. We will definitely re-visit the Roost on our next College Station trip."

She even had home made granola for us … YUM!!!

Stayed with kids","I grew up on Langford street and returned after 30 years to revisit some old memories. This stay was perfect! The neighborhood is quiet at night, like I remember. It easily accommodated my three children (tweens and teens), husband, and me. It's almost like a mini-urban farm, with a chicken coop, a garden, a country deck on the tiny house. Bee Creek runs behind the yard with a little foot path. The bathrooms are a split bathroom with a shower and sink in one room, and the toilet and sink in another. That really helps with a family 5. The kitchenette was well appointed as well. There is a refrigerator if you want groceries; and there is a microwave, toaster type oven, and hot plate for cooking a meal if needed. There is the ability to grill outside also, if I recall correctly. Rodney and Ann are a delight to talk to also, and I really enjoyed getting to know them. Thank you Rodney and Ann!"

Despite being in the middle of College Station (location, location, location!), it felt like a quiet retreat in the country. Ann and Rodney have thought of every amenity to create a well-equipped tiny home (extra bedding, make up removing towels, coffee, cooking staples like EVOO & butter and yummy welcome chocolates). Ann was an amazing host and even shared some special recipes with me she'd perfected over time. The Roost is a TRUE Airbnb experience and NOT some stripped down rental provided by an out of town company....I can't wait to stay at The Roost again soon."

Stayed a few nights","I stayed here with a few friends for a campus visit and we loved it! There was plenty of space for us and we each (4) had a bed to ourselves. With a kitchen, shower, and bath it was like a nice hotel room suite but such a better deal! There's a nice porch area outside and lots of space inside for recreation/visiting as well. It's in their back yard so you have your own private space separate from the house.
They have a very well behaved dog too! I hardly noticed the chickens were there (no noise to worry about)
It took us a minute to figure out how to set the temperature but once we did it was perfect. Everything was pretty self explanatory but if not, the host was available to help."

Stayed a few nights","Super charming & creative, The Roost is a “tiny house” with a huge presence & heart! Though we arrived quite late, & had an easy “contactless” check-in, Ann & Rodney welcomed us personally to make sure we were comfortable. We were fascinated by the Murphy Beds & loft ladder set-up, designed & made by Rodney. They encouraged our use of their outdoor spaces, so we explored the garden, harvested eggs from “the ladies,” and hosted our cadet’s fish buddies & families using Ann’s grill & patio- but our favorite part was enjoying the sweet canine comfort of Olaf (upon request) on the spacious deck. The kitchen was very well stocked & Ann included so many little things that a traveler might have forgotten or needed, even printed labels on light switches or for a bit of instruction - plus little vases w a bright yellow flower! She even loaned us crutches after an injury! What a blessing- & only 10 minutes from campus. We will be back."

Unique amenities (pizza oven, fresh greens from garden & fresh eggs from chickens). Ann baked a delicious, fresh blueberry dessert to welcome us and baked apples later in the week. We were close to college station events/activities, but it felt like a quiet place in the country. So many little touches to make us feel comfortable and have friends join in the fun. She had some board games we pulled out right away one rainy evening. My dearest friend for over 30 years was visiting for a week. She was able to be instantly cozy, have plenty of chatty girl time, and relax in this great get away space. We recommend this great place as a cozy get away for a small group/ family or longer term stay for a couple (any age/ phase in life)."

If I were to describe The Roost in 2 words, I would describe it as ""perfect place"". Love every single thing about The Roost! We had a great time in there and Ann was really nice and helpful. Ann completely welcomed us and gave us a quick feedback. We also had a good time with the Ladies(chickens) and learned a lot nature. The kids loved the second floor and the bamboo in the back yard. It was fun to collect the eggs and feed them every morning. We made a delicious cheese and pepperoni pizza at the 'pizza oven' in the back yard. It was very cool making a pizza with a real 'pizza oven'. Ann also let us use their grill. Lastly, the morning we left, Ann prepared a little breakfast for us to take out. It was really good and heartwarming.
If we visit College Station again, we would definitely stay at The Roost!!"

We were about to leave when I saw her in the yard and stepped out to say hi. We started talking about chickens, butterflies, plants and architecture (my daughter is an architecture student) and we ended up leaving with fresh eggplant from her garden, wildflower seeds and she even dug up a few passion flower vines for us.

Stayed a few nights","Ann and Rodney are amazing hosts and have a great place! They are incredibly thoughtful and put in small touches that true Lt shows their southern/Aggie hospitality. My family stayed there for a game and it was great! We weren’t far from campus, nice quiet area to come back to and a kitchen where we didn’t feel we had to brave the post game crowds at restaurants. They even provided a clear bag to bring into the game, 12th man towels, and ponchos. They are the sweetest people and really showed my mom how awesome it is to use AirBnB over hotels. Great value for game weekend! Thanks for the great time! Will definitely stay here again if it’s not booked up!!!!! Gig Em! Regan ‘06"

Stayed one night","To the future traveler guests: Ann's cute Roost tiny home has the look of the country charm and cozy, friendly environment. The hens were next to the tiny home and fenced off but you can enjoy the fresh eggs for breakfast. The Queen Murphy beds were easy to pull down and pull up back to its frame. The dining room table and stools reminded me of the café style bistro table and chairs for the gatherings. The bathroom were separated in two different rooms for privacy. The tiny home has all the amenities of a regular size house. My favorite part of the Roost is the porch deck that offers the peace and quiet to enjoy the nature surrounding this tiny home. Thank you."

Stayed a few nights","Stay at The Roost! That is the best thing I can say. The space is quite roomy, even with two beds pulled down. It's all clean and cozy. There are little instructions everywhere to help you navigate any issues. Ann has thought of everything you might need and if you need more, you just text and it's right there. I slept in the loft and it was very comfortable and much larger than it appears in the pictures. We spent a lot of time on the porch and it has great amenities such as good lighting and mosquito repellents. When we looked around, we found so many little amenities. Truly much better than any hotel room, and larger than a hotel room as well. This is well worth your money. I found it close to everything we needed. If you want to walk or run Bee Creek Park is quite close and a great place to get out and exercise. I highly recommend this to you!"

Rodney and Ann are one of the nicest couples who share a true gift of hospitality and share unique gifts and talents with others. The tiny house is quite comfortable, the chickens are a hoot and the garden is outstanding. Breakfast was an absolute cherry on top."

The location is great, and the property itself is amazing. The inside of the Roost is so unique and fun, plenty of room and very clean/nice. Outside there is a nice big patio with a spacious yard with chickens and it’s just a blast. We had friends over and spent most of our time out on the patio enjoying the nice weather. The hosts obviously put a lot of thought into making this a great place to stay and were very responsive and polite. We can’t say enough nice things about this spot, we will definitely stay here again!"

Stayed with kids","While looking for a place to stay during our visit to Santa’s wonderland I stumled acrossed The Roost. The Roost offered everything we needed and more and was only a short drive to SW! This was my parents first stay in a tiny home that is located in a backyard so they were hesitant to say the least. Although, shortly after our arrivel they fell in love and look forward to the next one.
Everything in The Roost was very thought out, anything we needed we found. We were provided breakfast that included fresh eggs from chickens on site, plenty of toys for the kids, and a beautiful deck to hang out on.
The only thing I wish I could’ve had and didn’t was another night at The Roost. There is an outdoor pizza oven I would’ve loved to use!
If you’re looking for a place to stay while in College Station I highly recommend The Roost, you won’t be disappointed!"

Stayed a few nights","The Roost is a warm, comfortable, and welcoming place. The Roost is a getaway in its own right. The hosts, Ann and Rodney, go above and beyond to make your stay memorable. From the moment you arrive, you realize what great people they are.
We stayed over the weekend and were met at the door with Aggie cookies and a welcoming note, which my daughter's thought was very cool! During the entire weekend, we were spoiled--with a great breakfast on our first morning to the conversations we had with Ann & Rodney. Both are great hosts!
Meeting the ""ladies"" was the highlight for my daughters and they enjoyed finding eggs and having a ""real"" chicken egg with their breakfast. The porch on The Roost is inviting--my husband and I spent time on the porch just having some ""us"" time. The porch was great because you could have music outside while having a glass of tea (our choice was Christmas music due to the time of year) and just enjoy nature.
The Roost is one place you will want to visit again and again and each stay be longer and longer. It's a true one of a kind and the hosts, Ann and Rodney, have done a fantastic job in making The Roost such a fantastic and warm place to be.
It's the only place we'll ever stay in Aggieland! Gig 'Em and Whoop!"

Upon our arrival, Ann greeted us at the door, gave us a thorough tour of the place, and surprised us with freshly baked cookies and a delicious breakfast pastry in the fridge (which was amazing the next morning!). She has everything you could possibly need available (toilet paper, clean towels, soft pillows, bottled water, cranberry juice, etc.) and plenty of friendly instructions for using every appliance and also the restroom. Overall, the experience was above our expectations and I highly recommend Ann's home for a lovely stay at College Station."

The Roost was incredibly clean and filled with little hints/text about how to turn fans, lights, hot water, stereo etc on and off. It’s little touches like this that makes your stay incredible!! The chickens... where do I even start?! They are so cute and friendly. Our 4mo old was just so curious to watch them roam the yard. They follow you everywhere and are so well trained to just go back in their roost at the end of the day!
