Stayed a few nights","Quite possibly our favorite Airbnb stay to date. We couldn't have asked for a better location. Everything we wanted to do was a short and pleasant walk away. Parking was a breeze; on the street directly in front of the unit, and we never had to compete with other cars. The space was cozy and quiet (we occasionally heard footsteps from the upstairs neighbors, but it wasn't a bother). The bed was comfortable, if a little small for the two of us, and we slept well. Courtney was responsive and easy to communicate with."

The Nitty Gritty Guest Manual is instructive without being ""rule bound,"" and has current recommendations for things to do around town. Amenities are outstanding with lots of extras. The kitchen is well stocked with everything you would need to cook if you prefer to stay in. A cozy escape, you will feel refreshed!

The location made it easy to access the quaint town and lake; within easy walking distance to everything. The home offered all the amenities one could need and is beautifully decorated. Courtney was a great host; proactively communicating and providing great instructions for my stay. I would highly recommend this home to anyone visiting the Coeur d'Alene area.

Stayed a few nights","This Airbnb was an awesome find for us! We usually stay in Airbnb's so are very selective. This quaint older home is so beautifully updated and had ALL the comforts needed. Courtney had even decorated it for the holidays which made it feel all the more homey! We come to CDA annually as a getaway reprieve from all the holiday rush, so we look for quiet and comfort and we sure found it! Its located very close to anything you could want to do in the resort area of CDA. We just parked our car (right out front so very convenient!) and when ready to explore we were able to walk the couple of blocks to coffee shops, restaurants, parks and the resort for our cruise. The couple of times I needed to communicate Courtney was very responsive and quick to get back to me. Her Nitty Gritty book with descriptions of amenities along with suggestions and maps for the area was very helpful. We thought it was a fantastic place and are already planning our next CDA visit with Courtney and this Airbnb!"

Stayed a few nights","I've stayed at Airbnbs around the world since 2015... this was the Martha Stewart of places... holiday decorations and charm and homey comfort. Very cute and well appoint with most of the kitchen stuff and amenities one would want. For these relishing / relaxing in a lovely space.... modern, yet ole home charm, stay here! Quiet, family neighborhood, very quiet the midweek I was there. Some places close, but most walks were over a half mile... not bad, but not like two blocks away. fun restaurants and bars and live music. wonderful spot, would definitely stay again. Nice lil basket of coffee, tea, some snacks and other seasonal yummys. fun touch."

Courtney’s Airbnb is by far the best and we have stayed at many as well as having several airbnbs ourselves! The property was fantastic with high end finishes all throughout. So much thought has been put into this gorgeous place. It was so cozy with lots of pillows and blankets, well stocked with spices for cooking, high quality towels, sheets and linens, and even dimmer lights for setting the mood in every room. Oh and….it’s located only a block off of the main drag where there are endless places to go for food and entertainment!!!!"

Stayed a few nights","One of the loveliest AirBnBs I’ve ever stayed in. Highly recommend!
The communication, location, and amenities were all superb.
COMMUNICATION: Courtney is congenial, kind, and thorough. Her written instructions (in both the app and the house itself) proved so helpful, and she responds fast and courteously!
LOCATION: Walking to the main downtown stretch and/or the lake takes mere minutes. The neighborhood was safe, clean, charming, and friendly. And the fall foliage looked amazing!
AMENITIES: I’d forgotten a couple items, and they were available in the house. So convenient!
I’ll be back!!"

Stayed a few nights","I cannot share enough positive sentiments about this cute Airbnb! My initial attraction to this airbnb was that Courntey posted the wifi internet speed, which was a huge factor since I work from home. I was able to enjoy moments away from my desk and explore the downtown that was walking distance. Within 2 blocks we were near delicious restaurants and cute coffee shops, with nightlife options too. The amount of amenities Courtney offers is incredible! I had forgotten so many little items as I rushed to pack for my trip and she had everything stocked - from mouth wash to body lotion and snacks. She was understanding of my last-min work meeting request and allowed us to check out 1 hour later than planned so I could take my meeting without interrupting my workday (which helped me be less stressed, and made my boss happy too). The home is clean and pristine with so much to offer. You can tell Courtney puts her heart into her home and customer service <3 I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"

She has added a few personal touches to your stay, like frosted mugs ready to go in the freezer, a coffee/tea/wine bar. She even made our furry family member right at home with a dog blanket and her own little water dish bar! The bed was a queen size and was the most comfortable bed we have slept on. Courtney has many other hospitality perks just waiting for you! I know we will be back!"

Stayed a few nights","The 611 Suite is one of three rental units in an older home. The 611 Suite has been completely renovated and the floor plan adjusted to be suitable for rental. EVERYTHING...kitchen, laundry, bedroom, living room...is exceptionally well done for its purpose. Moreover, the hosts have been extremely thoughtful in how they stocked the unit with small appliances, utensils, dishes, silverware and so on. A person would be hard pressed to need something that was not available. Further, the hosts provide everyday items like pens, tape, post-it notes as well as some treats...candy, energy bars, nuts, etc. Combined, all the small touches make a guest feel welcome and comfortable right from the start.
It is an easy walk from the 611 Suite to downtown Coeur d'Alene and its restaurants, gift and specialty shops, parks and the entire Garden District. DO NOT miss Cisco's Gallery of rare and exceptional Native American, Cowboy and Western art, jewelry, weapons, furniture and more."

There are also hiking trails connected to the parks. We had a great time. We didn't need to contact Courtney during our stay, but upon checking in, she messaged me to let us know that she's there if we need anything. The kitchen was stocked with some quality staple items such as grass-fed butter, local raw honey, a few local coffees, a large selection of spices for cooking / seasoning which was great for cooking meals. The gas oven and cooktop are super nice, as was the cookware which we used for meals while there. The house and floors were very clean; we were comfortable walking around barefooted inside. The bathroom was immaculate, the shower is very luxurious, my wife felt like a queen using it. Just a fantastic place to stay, and we hope to go back some day."

Truly excellent location: only 2 blocks to our fav coffee place, and easy walking distance to everything on Sherman and great restaurants in midtown. Very clean, beautifully updated, and super comfortable. All lighting was dimmable, creating a very inviting atmosphere in each room. USB ports on each side of the bed, exactly where needed. We didn’t use the kitchen, but noted it was well equipped, including coffee/tea, snacks, a bottle of wine, and two beer glasses chilling in the freezer. Door code was customized to our phone number, so it felt very secure. And, importantly, easiest check-out instructions anywhere!"

Stayed about a week","I don’t normally write a really detailed review but this place deserves it! If I could give 10 stars I would. Courtney offered great communication and made sure we had everything we needed. There was one minor issue and she took care of it right away.
The home has everything you need. The kitchen is well appointed and has all the things you need for cooking like spices and cooking oil. Things that are kind of a pain to buy so it was nice not to have to. There were many ways to make coffee and a bag of coffee for us to use. She also left snacks and the yummiest huckleberry taffy from a local store. Fresh flowers awaited our arrival.
I really appreciated the hand soap, cleaning supplies, plenty of towels, tp etc….
The bed was super comfy and the sheets so soft.
The bathroom is beautiful and the shower water pressure was amazing!
The front yard was the perfect spot for morning coffee or evening wine.
Can we talk location? A quick 5 minute walk takes you to all the best downtown has to offer. Check out the Bakery on the Lake. So yummy and just 2 blocks away! Gelato on the lake, also so good.
The care and attention to detail is evident when you stay here.
We didn’t want to leave and cannot wait to return."

While the home is an apartment, it felt very private and we had no issues with noise. We really enjoyed just sitting on the front porch.
Location was on point as well. Plenty of bars, restaurants and water attractions were within a 10 or 15 minute walk away but the home itself is away from the main strip hustle and bustle.
Check in and check out was easy, and Courtney was very available and accommodating with the few hiccups that came up.
This place 100% met or exceeded my expectations! I will recommend to friends and family and stay here again if given the opportunity."

Stayed a few nights","So there we were, at 1 AM, with no key to the AirBnB. We had lost it at a show in Spokane. No choice but to call our host, expecting grump and irritation (I would be if someone was calling that late). But no. She picked up the phone and was gracious, good-humored, and kinder than we deserved. She readily helped us out and gave us some tips to calm down, since we were a bit frazzled.
Mill House is the best vacation rental experience I’ve ever had, including fancy hotels. The charming decor, incredible attention to detail in amenities, and our host’s clear love for what she does shines through at every turn. From the fully stocked snack/tea/coffee bar, to the replacements for items frequently left behind, we felt so incredibly at home that we were sad to leave.
If you want a cozy, comfortable cabin-like experience in CDA, and want to feel like your host cares about you and your individual experience, Mill House is the best there is, and I hope to return there again someday."

Though compact, everything was organized very well, and there was helpful written information. We wished we could have stayed longer to enjoy the outdoor seating/lounging areas. We would definitely stay here again."

She left it clear instructions on how to use everything in her home and was responsive to my questions. I would highly recommend her place if you are going to be checking out CDA for a few days. I'd also recommend the hiking trails (west side canfield) located only 10minutes north of her place.

The private space is easy to get to, and located in an area near downtown.
Susan is a responsive and very prepared host. We appreciated Susan's touches in the Mill House and all the accommodations.
The bed is super comfortable!!
We also liked the bathrobes and wore them to have coffee in the morning on the deck.
The check out time of noon is also welcome as it allowed time to relax and unwind for the drive today.
I appreciated the pads and tampons in the bathroom, and am grateful more hosts are offering these to guests."

The Mill House is only 1 mile from downtown and Coeur d’ Alene lake. It’s a great location, with a parking spot just for guests. The little front porch was a great place to sit and have coffee each morning. The yard is beautiful!
She was quick to respond through messaging and super easy to communicate with. She went out of her way to make last minute accommodations for a last minute change we made. She truly is a super host with a super Airbnb. We will definitely be staying there again when we go back.
Thank you Susan! 😊"

She had robes, slippers, rain jackets with umbrellas and so much more too list! But that’s just the beginning- Susan has truly thought of everything and so much more.
What sets Susan’s place apart from other AirBnBs is the attention to detail and the extra touches that make you feel truly welcome and at home. Impeccably clean and adorably decorated and for a tiny place, it was perfect for my stay. The bed was sooo comfortable!

Stayed with kids","Great Little Spot Near Downtown
This property is an excellent value for the area, and I would highly recommend it. As can be seen from the pictures, it is somewhat small, but that is exactly what I consider to be the property's greatest strength. Designed with efficiency in mind, the space is exactly what a party of 2 would need to feel right at home - including several small but very personal touches (notepads and pencils, water bottles in fridge, etc). With right-down-the-street access to some of Couer D'Alene's finest shopping, eating, and scenery, what you get for the price is very difficult to beat in my opinion. 5 stars for the clear effort that the host puts into a quality experience. Make good memories here!"

Denise responded promptly when I messaged her with questions. The apartment was very comfortable and spacious, with a wonderful shower and good heating system. The apartment is separated from the main house by an attached garage and there was no problem with noise even when they had a family dinner for the holiday.
We enjoyed the surrounding area, walking back the lane and driving through the neighborhood. We saw flocks of turkeys, white tail deer, and a herd of elk in the front yard and on the nearby road. It's a lovely, peaceful place to stay, and only a short drive into town. We enjoyed our stay and couldn't have asked for better hosts."

Had a very generously sized shower. Even had access to one bay of the garage with a back entrance from the garage to the apartment. Hosts were very friendly and responsive, and their German Shepherd Mina was very well mannered and sweet. One of the nicest, most welcoming and comfortable Airbnbs I've come across. Would be at the top of my list anytime I stay in the area."

Stayed a few nights","First off, I'm not one who writes reviews. However, I feel that this stay deserves one. My daughter and I came to Post Falls to visit family and after a couple recent stays in hotels I had no desire to revisit that hell. I looked to Air BnB hoping for a better experience. Denise's place looked great online...as do they all. When we arrived we were very please to find exactly what was advertised plus more. The suite is private, comfortable, quiet and feels like home. You can even park in the garage if you want. So close to town and yet you are actually out in the country. Take your time when driving out to Denise's as you will absolutely see a ton of wildlife along the way. Deer, turkeys and more.
As to the suite, clean is an understatement. The suite is immaculate with a wonderful kitchenette, huge bathroom and I truly felt like I could just live there. Denise went out of her way to be available if you had any needs and yet was invisible.
Bottom line, 9.9 out of 10!"

Denise’s place is spacious, SO CUTE, but most importantly clean and delightfully peaceful. It’s a noteworthy getaway; I always felt safe and welcomed. She even has a sweet dog who’s sometimes hanging in the yard who loves to play fetch; what a nice treat!!
The location of this airbnb is also wonderful (but I would stay here even if this property didn’t have easy access to almost everything and downtown CDA).
The shower is spacious, the bed is blissfully comfy, and the little kitchenette has everything you might need for making breakfast/light meals. I will definitely stay here again! 10/10; no flaws at all. Love this place!!!"

It's a short drive into Coeur d'Alene, with all the fun you'd expect from a lake resort town: a variety of shops, lots of art, great restaurants, adventure activities, and beautiful walks or bike rides. It's also within day drives to other lakes, towns, and hikes."

The host was so helpful in answering any questions we had and was available by phone if we needed her.
The king size bed was so comfy and we really felt at home. I was really impressed by the size of the shower and I loved the wide vanity in the bathroom. 10/10"

Stayed a few nights","Cannot say enough about how amazing our stay was, the space was more than what we expected, everything was spotless and so cozy! The whole property is just beautiful, we encountered one of the hosts on a couple of occasions on the property over the course of our stay and she was just lovely, wanted to make sure we were comfortable and had all of our needs met and was genuinely concerned about the quality of our stay. The BEST part of our stay was the amazing Mina, who is a gorgeous, incredibly friendly and extremely well-trained German Shepard who greeted us with open paws and kept a caring eye on us and the rest of the property, when she and my husband weren't playing keep away with her ball, of course. I was feeling a little under the weather on one day during our stay so I stayed behind at the property and just rested in the very comfortable and homey setting, all the while with Mina making her rounds and always making a stop back by the apartment to make sure I was okay ( I purposely left the door open by a millimeter so I could see when she stopped by, but she is so well-trained, even when I thought I could use a furry snuggle, she would not enter the guest space, much to my disappointment, but very much to the credit of her caring and doting owner, as not all guests are fans of the furballs). In addition to the wonderful accommodations, the location itself was perfect, very short drive into quaint Post Falls, which has quite a bit to offer in the way of awesome restaurants, bars, shopping, etc., and even while it was snowing on our drive to the airport to return home, it was still less than a 45 minute drive. You don't need to look any further, do yourself a favor and book this fantastic space, you absolutely won't regret it!!!! Thank you so much to Denise and her husband (and Mina!) for a perfect long weekend!!!!!!!"

Denise was kind enough to move our booking to a week later without issue, as I had a ski accident requiring surgery in May (our entire summer plan had to be changed).
Her home is close in to the city (10-12 minutes' drive), but far enough removed for some lovely peace and quiet. The suite is perfect for both a short overnight during a road trip or for a longer stay. The bed was SO comfortable - much appreciated after a busy week and a long drive from Whitefish, MT. She has everything you'd need to make some simple meals in the kitchenette space. Denise even provided ground coffee and some breakfast items for us.

Stayed a few nights","The Tubbs Hill Hideaway is a great efficiency apartment in a superb location. The studio apartment is located in a very nice residential neighborhood and is easily walkable to downtown Coeur d’Alene (CdA), the Lake, and Tubbs Hill. Vanessa and Eric have thought of everything to make a stay enjoyable. A great layout, modern, and clean! The bed and couch were super comfortable and the bathroom so spacious. We didn’t use the stove as we prefer to eat out while on vacation, but the coffee maker and microwave came in handy for us. There were a number of restaurant recommendations on the white board that we tried and agree the suggestions were worth mentioning. We sure appreciated the washer and dryer (and laundry soap) as we had come from another short term rental unit prior to coming to CdA. Communication before and during our stay with Vanessa was excellent and we enjoyed talking with Eric in person as well. We highly recommend the Tubbs Hill Hideaway for anyone wanting a comfortable and safe place as a “home base” to explore CdA and nearby towns!"

Stayed over a week","The Tubbs Hill Hideaway is a sweet little gem of a cottage. Merely one block from McEuen Park the proximity to downtown CDA is a treasure. This studio has everything you could need for an extended & comfortable stay, including a full-sized refrigerator, stacked washer/dryer and a well-stocked kitchenette. I spent an entire wintertime as the guest of Eric & Vanessa and they are exceptional hosts - taking extra care to notify me if winter storms were coming, checking up on me which I really appreciated. A daily 6am walk with the pup in tow to Vault Coffee - took mere minutes from this locale. This quaint part of town, called Tubbs Hills was filled with peaceful evenings, cute little cottages and very friendly neighbors. Lastly, don’t miss the incredible ‘gang’ of wild turkeys which roost in the tops of pines in the park one block West and make a daily strut past the hideaway. If you’re lucky enough to see the full show of plumage, be sure to capture it – they’re certainly not camera shy – and that can all be done while sitting comfortably warm and cozy on the Tubbs Hill Hideaway cottage sofa!"

fan should you need a little extra noise or air moving for sleep. The bed was quite comfortable and the neighborhood was quiet - no trouble sleeping after our long days exploring the area. We really enjoyed our stay and felt all around comfortable."

It’s about a mile walk west to the downtown core at Sherman and 4th. What stood out the most about our visit is how comfortable the home was. The beds, linens, couches, and nice touches like blankets made the home feel so warm and comfortable. It felt like a proper home that I could happily stay at for a longer stay. Jacob was very responsive and even accommodated an extension for us. Checkout was a breeze, in that all we had to do was depart by checkout with no chores which was appreciated!

Located in the sweet spot, this cute accommodation will fit your needs whether your stay is long or short. The friendly and outgoing host is the cherry on top of this delightful Airbnb sundae!"

I was disappointed to find there was no outlet to plug my laptop into in the designated study area. After traveling all day, I had homework due and had to wait for my laptop to charge in the kitchen. All in all, we enjoyed our stay. Ver clean, comfortable would definitely rent from Jacob again!!!"

It made it easy for us to cook and eat in, which was a big plus for us. Plenty of space for a walker to move around (my dad needs one to walk). Being all on one level was also perfect for us. The neighborhood is pretty quiet. Parking is off street and ample. We were very happy with this place. Great quality and value. I would suggest that you might need a night light in the bathroom, as there is no window, so it's very dark in there at night. Would definitely recommend."

I misread when checkout was and he just politely knocked on the door to remind me ""he tried messaging thru the app numerous times first but i was in the shower"" and he was completely understanding and didn't rush me to get out. I even ran over his mailbox ""completely my fault big truck tight driveway"" and I told him I already had my people on there way over to fix it. Still no extra charge sent my way even though it would have been completely justifiable. I just replaced it and he was happy. The house was spotlessly clean and organized. Lots of live plants and very well taken care of furniture. Nicely updated downtown home. Overall I would give it an A++"

Stayed a few nights",We had a great stay at our Coeur d’Alene condo. It fit our needs perfectly by providing a home base to explore the area. The condo was clean and comfortable. Really appreciated the coffee and tea provided. It was a nice touch. Great communication by Robert and Torey about all things that were necessary to know. We would stay again.

Stayed a few nights","The location was great! When you go downstairs to the out side, restaurants, movie theatre, boutiques, and etc. we’re right there and you can go to downtown area in 7 minutes. When we went inside the room there was a bottle of wine on the table welcoming us. The condo has a fully equipped kitchen, 2 bed rooms with 2 full bath (master bath was very spacious and had a walk-in closet), nice size living room and a balcony. We had everything we needed and felt at home. I liked the assigned under ground parking spots also and I can’t forget to mention about the bed was really comfortable too.
My husband and I really enjoyed the condo and the area. I will definitely stay there if we have another chance to go back to Coeur d’Alene!"

Stayed a few nights","We come to this area every year and this was right up there in our favorite places to stay.
The location is incredible. Lots of cool stores and restaurants on site. McDonald’s is right there too, so my wife was able to get her tea every day. We visited Cold Stone Creamery a few nights as well.
They moved the weekly farmers market to this spot too, which was one of the main reasons we selected it. So nice to be able to walk right upstairs when you’re done shopping!
The residents that we ran into were very friendly. They even asked about our travels. Total contrast to a lot of places the don’t like short-term rentals in their building.
We ran into one small issue with the building door code, but it was mainly user error. On the building door, you have to enter # before you enter the passcode, whereas we didn’t need to enter # before the garage or apartment passcode. They had # on the instructions, but i still had to think about it each time I entered it. Again, just user error."

This area was also close to the areas we visited, most within a 10 minute drive. Since we were there during the snow, the parking garage was a nice benefit. No cleaning snow off the car! There are also many plug-ins available in every room for charging electronics, which was convenient. Anything we needed was available. We did need to message the host several times about some things we were unsure about. The host responded quickly with satisfactory information. This is a place that feels like home while you are in Couer d’Alene or nearby communities."

Stayed a few nights","A lovely spot to stay! To me, it has a cottage feel. So peaceful. Walking distance to the lake and trailhead. I enjoyed a hike around the water's edge and ended up in town for lunch. Magical. Lots of wildflowers to enjoy and photograph. There are two easy to ride bikes to use. I rode on the Centennial Trail for a few hours and rode right along the lake & river. I think serious bike riders can go much farther than I did. The stained-glass windows are pictured in the AirBnB listing, but these are truly wonderful. The carpet isn't absolutely perfect, and there are some chips on the corners here or there, this wasn't my focus. The kitchen was easy to cook in, and enjoyed playing a few games from the shelves in the living room. The interior colors and comfy furniture make this place a hidden gem."

All surfaces, floors, appliances, furniture, sinks, etc. were all spotless! We really enjoyed the living room, and it’s very comfortable chair and sofa. The bed and bedding were excellent. My wife loved having two places to sit and read outside, with comfy furniture on the front porch, and on the small back patio.
We used the provided bikes to cruise the charming neighborhoods nearby, as well as take a ride to and along thenortheast side of the lake. (Look for the North Idaho Centennial Trail..is about five miles each way if you turn around at the BIG hill! Great views of the lake.) Ramon’s is an easy walk to the lake and two public beaches.
A great experience in a great space, a great host, and a great location. We’d stay here again in a heartbeat."

Close lake, however packed and we couldn’t really use becssue of that. We ended up driving to another beach but be warned- you must arrive early - like before 10 to get a spot to park. Backyard is not much. I wouldn’t say it’s a place I would hang out due to it being not really maintained and it sits next to a somewhat not taken care of private house. Location is the best thing going here."

The cabin has a great washer and dryer so we didn't have to pack too many clothes. Detergent and dryer products were available as well. The neighborhood is very quiet with some gorgeous Antebellum homes in the area. The cabin is about one block from the lake, which is surrounded by mountains and forests.

Recommendations to things like a Coeur d'Alene River float, paddleboard spots, and mountain bike trips and rentals were great! The cruiser bikes at Ramon's house for guests to use were fantastic. We rode in the neighborhood and on the Centennial trail and felt like locals! The location is AMAZING. Beaches! Trail running! Shops and restaurants! Charming neighborhood! There is so much going on right outside the door."

We had a lovely backyard bbq with a couple visitors. The amenities are great! We had everything we needed! Highly recommend for a couple wanting location to restaurants etc but a peaceful, relaxing atmosphere! 🤙🏽❤️😊 ps. Neighbors are delightful"

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed our stay and loved the location near the lake, and Tubbs Hill. The trails on the hill provided a great walk and views of the lake. The house was nice but it was a little dark and most windows are stained glass or frosted. This adds to the quaintness of the home, along with the natural wood trim. The kitchen is well appointed but kitchen and bath linens were limited. Check-in was easy. Furnishings and bed were comfortable. The weather during our stay was frequently rainy, or we would have enjoyed riding the provided bikes. We would return to this location if/when back in the area."

Stayed a few nights","The Cottage was a welcoming retreat just a short walk from anything you might want to do in CDA. Ramon was quick to answer messages asking for recommendations before our stay for paddle board rental. Sanders Beach is close with free, on-street parking and it as busy as the downtown beach, Tubbs Hill is a block away for incredible sunset and rise views or gorgeous views of the lake any time. Bikes to cruise around this friendly neighborhood were a great touch. We also had turkeys with babies come through the front yard one morning.
The cottage it beautiful and cozy. The stained glass windows throughout made it feel like we were in an art gallery and the colors and swirls change with the light and shadows making us follow them throughout the day. The wood floors were beautiful as well. A unique and fantastic home.
The Viking, gas cook stove was a joy to use. The kitchen was well stocked and even had a coffee grinder and french press.
Lots of outside seating and opportunities to relax and connect here. The neighbors are great and have a little free library for kids so bring books to trade if you like that sort of thing. :)
We would definitely stay here again."

Stayed one night","Ramon is super friendly and quickly responds to any questions you might have. We loved our night at this awesome, perfectly located cottage. It felt perfect for a couple looking for a night in a quiet neighborhood near downtown. We made reservations for dinner the night that we arrived and were able to make the very easy walk down to the resort in less than 20 minutes. The next morning we walked back to get coffee near the park then did a quick and easy hike on Tubb's Hill, which has an exit point near the beach not more than five minutes from the cottage.
The cottage itself was comfortable and had all that we needed for the night. If we can get away for a night or two in the future, we'll be looking here first!"

Stayed a few nights","We booked this house as a place for our family to stay for our daughter’s law school graduation. We wanted enough room so we could all stay together. It was perfect! There was plenty of room, plenty of bathrooms and space so we weren’t on top of each other all the time. The deck was fabulous and that’s where we spent most of the time. The view is amazing! We watched deer, turkey, bald eagles and many birds from the deck. We enjoyed the speaker system out there as well as corn hole every night! We cooked most meals since there was a group of us and we had everything we needed in the kitchen. We didn’t get much time to spend in town because of graduation events, but we will definitely be back to explore Couer d’alene, and when we do, we will stay at this house again. Vince responds to any questions within minutes and was very pleasant to work with. Can’t wait to go back!"

A shout out to the neighbor up the street, George. Because of snow, we were stuck and couldn't get up the hill but George came to our rescue. He helped plow the streets, but when we still couldn't make it up the hill, he gave us a ride to town to get groceries so we can have dinner. Absolutely generous soul.

The kitchen had a variety of appliances, and a window that looks out to the trees (where we watched the deer in the morning). The bedding was comfortable and cozy. The living room with the panoramic views of the lake were honestly the selling point! The sunsets were beautiful. It was set back from the other houses that you felt like you had complete privacy, yet was only ~10 minutes from town. All in all we loved it!"

I really enjoyed having a barbecue grill and full kitchen amenities as I like to cook. It allowed me to eat much more healthy than I typically do when I travel.
The interior was soothing and spotlessly clean. I will be back in Coeur d’Alene for work other times through this year and I hope this cottage will be available for my use again. Highly recommended."

Stayed one night",Absolutely stunning spot to stay in! For the price this is it! Instantly walked in with complimentary treats! The bed was super comfortable and super clean cozy blankets! The bathroom was pristine and as stated before complementaries everywhere were amazing. The winner of the show was the hot tub! So cozy and relaxing in a wilderness like setting. So easy to get swept up in the scenery I nearly fell asleep while soaking in the hot tub. Highly recommend!

We loved the amenities and the overall cleanliness of the cabin. My only recommendation would be some extra blankets! It was colder than we expected (the heat works well to heat up the small space though). Thank you, Sam, for the wonderful experience! We hope to come back soon. :)"

If you have ATT expect to have little to no cell service (which isn’t always bad) but the wifi was strong so it didn’t feel like I was completely disconnected. Thats not a complaint just something to know if you need phone service at all times.
Highly recommend!"

Stayed one night","Honestly, I loved this place. I'll probably give it a try again, too. The only qualm I had was that it was described as secluded and private, but it isn't. Specifically the hot tub, there is one pallet put up as a ""privacy screen"" that faces the main house that neighbors it, but there's an open main highway on the other side and everyone and their mom driving by could see me in my swimsuit, in a hot tub with my husband for Valentine's Day, so that embarrassed me a little."

If you are comfortable with being stuck in bed all day or plan to go out a lot and primarily stay here just to sleep, you'll love it. Before booking with them, consider that this location has two uncomfortable bar stools in addition to the bed, so seating options are limited.
The outdoor temps were in the negatives when we stayed, and the heaters were great! Easy to adjust too.
The hot tub was great! I am pregnant and wanted to enjoy it without overheating. It was easy to do, considering we could easily adjust the temp down a little.
Lastly, because of the cold, our car wouldn't start the morning we checked out. Our message to the host was received and responded to quickly, and Sam helped us jump the car and head out safely!"

A couple of things to note:
The driveway might be challenging depending on the vehicle or weather.
There are no chairs or seating inside for lounging.
The bathroom door squeaks very loudly and might wake your companion.

We enjoyed sitting on chairs they provided while reading and chatting as we watched the little squirrels, robins and the two does and a newly born fawn. An 8 min drive to Hayden provided a get away for yummy food and grocery needs. The Fish Market place is awesome. There is also a road behind the cabin that makes for a great uphill walk. Our marriage was strengthened because of our stay. Thank you!"

Stayed a few nights",Got to say if your looking for a nice relaxing place that's not too far out of town but just enough to enjoy the quietness then this is the place. Yes there are neighbors close by but with the trees it definitely does make it feel like your alone. It felt great for me any my wife to come here and be able to decompress. The hot tub is a nice bonus. The only minor issue i had with the place is the parking and driveway. With the way its laid out you have a hard time seeing traffic and have to get a run at it to get up but quick enough to stop so you don't hit a tree. Also if you have a bigger truck is a very tight fit. All and all though we will definitely be staying again.

It's close enough to town while also feeling completely removed. While the tenants house is fairly close to the cabin, it felt very private and we were never bothered by anyone. Sam put a lot of heart and soul into this spot. It clearly shows and we were very honored to have it for our time in Hayden. Unfortunately, the downside of putting this honest review is that people will read it and I'm afraid of it being overbooked. We would love to come back here to get away from all the static from the world that constantly drowns us. It really helped us stay sane. Keep up the phenomenal work! I hope we were respectful to such a wonderful place!"

The bed was so comfortable we searched the make on the internet to possibly get one for our home. The host had Netflix available for us, even though we did not need it. The hot tub was great especially in the pouring rain. It was one of the best trips we have taken in a long time and the cabin made it that much more special. 100% recommend and we would love to come back!"

As locals, I love already knowing where I want to eat, and this little spot is so conveniently situated to be away from it all yet so close to some of the area's best eats to grab on the way in. The wooded vista past the hot tub is a thing of dreams. I am so grateful this is available to weary young parents who don't have a longer vacay in the cards!"

Stayed a few nights","Enchanted Cabin was surrounded by trees and wildlife. The host was great about responding to my questions. I appreciated the king size bed. Most air bnbs have queen beds. The complementary coffee, water, make up remover and qtips were helpful. The spa was hot and clean. Just be aware that there is a road that butts up to the back of the property so you don’t have complete privacy. Another thing to note, in case you care and want to bring them, there are no extra blankets. I’m a blanket hog in my sleep, which left my husband with just the sheet. I definitely recommend this place and I’m grateful that Sam has opened the Enchanted cabin to travelers."

Hot is a nice amenity but it was too cold for us this last weekend.
The host host had some nice touches with a coffee maker you brew coffee, tea or hot chocolate.
All in all we enjoyed it very much!!"

Stayed one night","The cabin is very clean and cute. Very private. Beautiful lake near by. It is northern Idaho in the winter so I fully expected snow - however the pipes froze which meant no running water, no shower, no flushing toilet. The host did offer a camp shower water in a bag type of solution or to drive 15 minutes to the local gym to shower. I had traveled 30+ hours due to flight delays and was honestly just looking forward to a shower and some sleep. Arriving at the cabin…the driveway wasn’t at all plowed out…I was told to “back up and get a running start” to plow through the snow for parking. The path to the cabin wasn’t at all shoveled….which meant trudging through about 6+ inches of snow to the cabin. When walking from the cabin back to my car I actually fell - banged up my knee and foot pretty good and cut up my wrist/arms from the ice and snow. With that said…I was able to take a nap and the bed was very comfortable. It was very quiet and peaceful."

Stayed one night","We loved this peaceful cabin. It is tucked away and very quiet. Our only complaint, it snowed while on our North Pole cruise, so when we got back to the AirBnB around 8:30pm there was an extra few inches of snow, and even our 4 wheel drive Tahoe got stuck in the parking spot(its on a hill and we kept sliding back out into the road) and we had to drive up the road, turn around and try again 5 times before successfully parking. There is nowhere else to park so definitely thankful we decided to drive our truck and not our little car for this trip. So make sure you have the means of getting through lots of snow to stay here in the winter. Other than this little thing, we had the best stay. Comfortable bed, hot tub was amazing, super quiet and peaceful cabin, extremely clean. We will definitely come back!"
