Stayed a few nights","if you want a QUIET getaway, this is perfect. My husband and I just spent the entire two days lounging around the pool. we even met the most precious cat ever who just wonders the large property. such a sweetie!!
the ONLY downside at all is the bed - it's very small, and a spring. I'd love to see a queen foam in it's place. but there is a futon and couch so my husband and I just each took a spot rather than try to make the bed work."

Stayed a few nights",Loved our tiny house in the woods. Very secluded and quiet. We were greeted by the cute adorable kitten. Hammock in the trees was fun. There was a pool and grill. Lots of outdoor seating. Hosts communicated quickly. Inside we enjoyed wifi and movies. The kitchen had everything you could possibly need to cook. Only about twenty minutes from the town. Real easy drive. Would definitely return. Thanks!

Stayed a few nights","The locations was awesome. I am not a fan of Florida’s cities. So being out in the country not far from smaller towns was great. Sat on the deck and enjoyed the scenery for hours. Relatively Close to fun
Outdoorsy stuff like hiking. Great bathroom. Great kitchen. Great pool. Easy to find. Safe. Secure. The bed was rough. Other than that no complaints."

Stayed over a week","We generally had a good time in the cabin; it was very quiet, and there is a very cute cat on the property. However, we didn't realize how far away the cabin is from any nearby town, but that might only be us as Europeans. The kitchen was well-equipped, but the water smelled a bit odd, so we didn't even use it for cooking. The shower could have been a nicer experience, too as the water felt a bit slimy on the skin. The bed is quite small, and for the price, a bit more comfort and space would have been nice. Nevertheless, the cabin is perfectly suitable for a weekend getaway."

Stayed a few nights","We booked one of the 3 cabins on the property for my brother's wedding at Arching Oaks which was only 10 minutes away! It was perfect because the property is pet friendly, so we were able to bring our dog. There are a few friendly outdoor cats that followed us around.
We utilized the pool, hammocks and lounge chairs but they also have multiple grills and picnic tables available in the common area. It's such a peaceful property to beyond, and you will wake up to beautiful sunrises.
The cabins are set up right next to a hang gliding business so some days you may see them running, which is pretty cool.
Keep in mind (as the pictures show), you have to climb a ladder to access the top floor, which is where the bedroom is - so you must be willing and able to climb up and down.
We would love to come back again and highly recommend any individual or couple who is looking for a cute little quaint place to stay!"

Stayed a few nights","I think the stay would have been a bit more pleasant if I wasn’t stressed out and disputing a charge my entire “vacation” here. The owners of this property only had one loose key to get into the cabin. First night, it fell out of my pocket while outside walking my dog. All of a sudden it’s pitch black, i’m alone in the woods, and the hosts have no way to help me get inside or to safety. If i didn’t have my phone on me to call for help, I would have been walking 1-2 miles in the dirt and dark alone to the closest person/gas station. Now they keep messaging me requesting $300 to replace the key and make copies. It is a pretty piece of property. But my interaction with the hosts made me feel uneasy and unsafe the rest of my time there. I only stayed because I had already paid for everything."

Stayed a few nights","This place is beautiful and relaxing, however it has a few things to be aware just in case, at 1st when we book the place the co-host was trying to charge extra fees because of our Emotional support animals this is not allowed in Airbnb and also in the Florida Law (that the 1st red flag) apparently the co-host didn’t like that I reject that extra fee and attitude change a little after that (bit rude or not that friendly) but we continue wiht our plans to get our mini hollyday in this small cabin.
when we arrive at the place there was extremely dark no lights at all I was bringing with me a flash light so I could find a person in one of the cabins who indicate me which one was designed to us, the next day we try to get in the pool but this was not very clean and give me impression that no maintenance was performed recently.
Last thing was that we explained to the host that we was on our birthdays and the ride to a supermarket (win dixie) is about 20 mins so we request a late check ou"

Bring your clubs, there's a golf course right across the street! The little gator bait bar down the street is a great little spot for some home style beers and pool. We'll definitely stay again when we visit Labelle."

Stayed a few nights","I can’t wait to go back. Rode our motorcycles there for a weekend getaway and ended up doing hang gliding too! Incredible location, the pictures don’t do it justice. Pool was wonderful, tiki hut with a hammock was incredible! Dirt road on the way in was tough on the bikes but it was hard packed enough. Bed was comfy, kitchen had everything you need, bathroom had a nice big shower. Super chemically water due to treatment for well water, never ran out of hot water. Highly highly highly recommend. Planning another trip here with my girlfriends."

Stayed a few nights","The stay was good. Very nice hosts who responded quickly and was very accommodating and helpful. Was a little disappointed in the parking set up. Towing a boat on a trailer with a big truck is not easy to pull in or back out of a one-car garage size driveway with an electric gate; but we managed; and the security of the gate was a nice thing. Not many amenities were there that would have been nice to have such as a baking dish/pan, foil (oven purposes), zip lock bags or Saran Wrap for covering food, more wash clothes, salt/pepper or any kind of condiments. The washer and dryer had two bottles of fabric softener but no laundry soap. I know it didn’t specifically say laundry soap was provided, but every Airbnb I’ve stayed at has had a washer/dryer and had laundry soap provided. Not a big deal though, luckily we had left a bottle in the truck from our last tournament a few weeks ago. Overall, it was a quiet place, nice and was clean. The house is actually attached to the hosts house; just a separate side and own entry; almost a duplex type feel to it, so didn’t feel very private. We were out fishing or there eating dinner and sleeping so that wasn’t a big deal. Even if we were there more, they didn’t bother us at all. Very nice hosts. Great response time and excellent with helping accommodate with the things that were not there. Thanks for the stay! It’s appreciated!"

Stayed one night","Very clean inside.
Much care was paid to details inside. Very charming. I did miss a toaster. But maybe I should have looked harder. We stayed only 1 day and left fairly early.
But I loved the outdoorsy experience of sitting in a big Florida back yard with chickens and lots of trees. Bbq pit. Etc.
I always wanted that experience.
The place would be great for kids with games and a little slide etc. Huge yard. (We had no kids).
I felt safe. It’s a bit in the middle of nowhere a feeling, but people are around.
Hostess is very friendly. But immediately gave us space and was to the point and quick with instructions.
The large porch makes it perfect for outdoor sitting and extends the living area.
Inside is not very roomy, but comfortable and extremely clean.
I would like to come back here."

Stayed with kids","This was indeed a cozy little farm. Lots of space on the farm for my sons to run around and ride bikes. Chickens were fun to feed and relaxing by the campfire made it feel even cozier.
The space itself is small but we don’t mind small living spaces as long as it’s clean and functional and this was exactly that. Every corner in the unit was thought out precisely.
The bunk beds were bigger than normal as they were custom made to fit in the space and the master bedroom matress was also comfortable.
If you’re looking for peace and quiet with friendly owners and farm life charm, look no further.
We would definitely stay here again!"

The only thing to be aware of is there is a train close by, so that can be noisy during the day if spending time outside however we had zero issue with it indoors and never heard it during the night. Overall we felt this place exceeded the description and we would stay again without question."

Stayed a few nights","Been staying at Lake Okeechobee-Clewiston for nearly 40 years. Never in this particular building and man do I regret it. Located directly between the tackle shop out the back door and Marina store and Tikki Bar out the front - it could not be in a more desirable spot. These buildings were built in the early 80’s but inside 119 you would never be able to tell it. Lawrence has modernized it with all the most current finishes and made sure there was a Starter Pack of all the necessities - Keurig and Cups, clean and abundant sheets, towels, and pillows, throw in a few laundry Tide Pods and we were set for a successful week. Most importantly - our group of 4 came home with about 200 fish of all sizes and varieties. We will be back. See ya next time and many thanks."

With a canal leading to the back of the room, it was very easy to access while on boat and couldn’t have been in a better location. We did not spend a lot of time in the room but it was a great place for us to crash after spending all day on the lake. Right next to the room is Roland Martin’s Marina with bass lure imaginable and they had some good tips about fishing the lake. Room is exactly as listed, we had a wonderful time!"

Very comfortable bed; perfect amount of space to unpack/repack my bike, restock food and water, have a warm meal & a good night's sleep, etc. And in the morning, the Clewiston LOST trailhead was conveniently located just a short distance away!
The space is essentially a lovely little studio apartment separated from the main home. It's clean and quiet with simple but adorable travel-themed decor. Lots of fresh towels and shampoo, and plentiful cupboard space to hang clothes. Remote controlled thermostat/fans. Walking distance to Walmart for drinking water and any essentials.
Surrounding neighborhood felt very safe/residential - I walked to/from Walmart alone after sunset and was totally comfortable. Would book again if I did the same trip."

Stayed a few nights","You're going to have a fantastic time staying in this spacious condo. The charm of a small town condo resort, located right on Lake Okeechobee. I stay here every chance I get when I'm in Clewiston, as it feels like home. Comfortable beds, multiple televisions and a powerful A/C unit help me wake up feeling well rested. There are several restaurants near by but with an oven, stove top, outside bbq, and refrigerator/freezer your meal prepping combinations are endless. The condo is furnished very nicely and always meticulously clean and well maintained. Coffee and the popcorn are included in your stay and are a nice little treat to start and end your day with. I do some fishing every night, as the lake is walking distance from the condo. A well maintained tennis court is on site. The pool always feels nice after a long day. As I'm typically out here for business, conducting work from this location is a no-brainer. The WiFi is always reliable and there are multiple USB charging ports in every room. Hands-down, staying here beats staying in a hotel. If by chance you do run into any issues or need anything, Jason will respond right away to assist you. He's a fantastic host!"

This was my first time NOT staying in a coastal town - so I wasn’t sure what to expect - but I thoroughly enjoyed the laidback nature of the Clewiston area.
At the end of the day, all my family wants is hot weather, a pool, and palm trees. And we got that!"

Stayed a few nights","Place was just as listed, right on the south canal of the lake. Super easy access to several boat ramps, food at the Tiki Bar, with lots of boats to watch. You could tell the condo has been upgraded, and is decorated nicely. We loved the artwork I the living room. The only minor issues we had is the Army Corp of Engineers is directly across the canal and the living room TV didn’t have a clear signal. The ACOE seem to be working on the dike, so we did deal with construction noise. However, it didn’t interfere with our enjoyment of the place, and it seems to only be a temporary thing. The TV issue was really only in the living room and just made it so we couldn’t watch TV as a family. Not a big deal at all, especially since there were TVs available for those that wanted them in the bedrooms. Beds were the most comfortable beds we have found at any AirBnB. Sergio was quick to respond to any questions we had and had a detailed list of what we needed to do to make checkout easy. We would definitely stay here again."

Sergio was very easy to communicate with and was responsive.

I had my own bathroom since there were no other guests at the house. Access to use the kitchen and prep food made this place way better than a hotel for me! I would stay again and would recommend other thru hikers/bikers to stay here too!

Stayed a few nights","His place was very easy to find and so convenient to close by restaurants and stores. Walking distance if one would want to that.
Steven answered my few calls immediately with respect and professionalism.
His place was worth the price. The only reason I gave a four is because of the overly squeaky bed. Made it a little difficult to sleep.
I didn’t use much of the amenities just because this only makes my 2nd Airbnb. The first was for my honeymoon. It was private with our own kitchen bath and such. At Steven’s house I felt awkward using the kitchen and such. This was not because of Steven or other house guests. That was all on me. But next time I will use more of the amenities."

There was a spacious screened-in room outside that was perfect for sitting around the table and playing games, or going into the jacuzzi ( which also was very clean) This area overlooked a lovely pool(clean) unfortunately it was cool at night so we didn’t go in. Our only issue was the bed; comfortable but very very squeaky with the slightest move, so didn’t really sleep (rm2) we would definitely return if we were in the other room. Steven responded to all questions promptly. Thanks for a nice stay and sharing your home!"

Stayed one night","What a great experience booking through AirBnB. My first time as a guest. Everything went beautifully. I went with my best friend (since 1950) and it was a trip of a lifetime. We could be as busy as we wanted to be or relax and got caught up on memories. We did both. I couldn't believe how clean the home was. The bedding was pristine and the bedroom was just so charming. The entire home looked like it was decorated by a professional. No clutter, just beauty. We felt very welcome to cook, snack and the refrigerator had plenty of space for us. Being elderly we were afraid that the TV was too loud, but was assured that he could hear nothing behind closed doors. My friend and I were free to use the home and it felt like ours. I could see this AirBnB door to door that is how special it is. So if you are hesitating for any reason you do NOT have to worry about cleanliness or privacy it is found here. So glad that we chose this...Thank you so much Carla.(Ohio)"

Stayed one night","I had never stayed at an Airbnb so did not know what to expect. I will NEVER stay in a hotel again. What an absolute fabulous experience. I was greeted at the door although was given directions how to enter if the host wasn't there. As an older guest (75) I felt like I was greeted by my adult
grandson. He was personable and showed me around his beautiful home. It is a home that you would find in Architectural Digest. Absolutely stunning and absolutely spotless. Beautifully decorated yet at the same time comfortable. I wasn't intimidated that I might accidentally spill
something on the floor. I needed to get away from the devastation that occurred on Pine Island during hurricane Ian. This was such a respite for me. So peaceful and relaxing, yet not boring. Plenty to do in such a beautiful safe area. And the lake was 5 minutes away. I will always stay here. Whether you live out of state and want to come south...or live in Florida..I would recommend that you stay at this amazing place."

The inside is well laid out with attractive furnishings, the amenities (towels, sheets etc.) are high end and lush, and every convenience was considered (plenty of plugs, shampoo and conditioner provided, coffee and plenty of post pans etc.).

The host is very easy to contact and very responsive both prior to arrival and during our stay. This host is probably the cleanest host I have encountered thus far. It is the perfect resort style getaway retreat for after a day of frustrating and rewarding fishing. We plan on using this host for ALL of our fishing trips!
BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!
The pictures simply do not do justice to the interior, the hosts have done a full remodel on the inside, and despite having to accommodate smaller spaces they did not hold back in their commitment to high end finishes. All aspects of this house are chic and luxurious. They committed to a modern and welcoming aesthetic - choosing good quality modern sleek furniture, sumptuous towels and bedding, and clean design. It is simply fantastic!"

Group trip","This was our second stay at Serenity Ranch. There are five us that travel to Clewiston each spring for a fishing trip. This place is perfect for us. Quiet neighborhood; well, except for the peacocks and roosters that great you in the morning! There are farm animals all around the place which is pretty cool. The best part of the ranch is the very large screened in porch with lots of fans to keep you cool. After a day of fishing, we play cards every night outside on the extra large picnic table and eat all of our meals there too. All of the amenities are in good working order. The beds are comfortable and the inside stays cool enough for comfort. The owner is also very accessible should you need to communicate with him. The outside is kept very clean."

Stayed a few nights","I'm a returning guest of this location because it made such an impact on myself and my family! if you're looking for a peaceful paradise away from the city, with lots of space for a large family and beautiful views this is your place.
The hosts are amazingly kind and responsive, the house was very clean when we arrived and the kitchen was fully stocked with every utensil and kitchen gadget you can possibly need.
I am a wheelchair user and this place is fairly accessible - the house is accessible, however I would recommend bringing a small ramp as there is a step between the kitchen and the living room area.
I was able to get around just fine and the covered patio is very spacious for a family get together, you can even choose between a bbq and a full gas stove!
I will surely return soon, this has become our family's go-to spot for get togethers, birthdays and holidays.
Thank you Paul for making us feel right at home, it's always the hardest leaving Serenity Ranch!"

It was exactly what we needed : enough bedrooms, bathrooms, outdoor kitchen, and plenty of space and privacy. Our 1 year old daughter was so excited to see the animals in the neighborhood: pony, donkey, pigs, ducks, chickens.
The neighborhood is very nice, canals and lake not far. Very safe and quiet.
We made a fire in the Fire pit in one of our evenings.
All was great , we all enjoyed our time at Paul's ranch.
Very highly recommend the Serenity Ranch for those who likes tranquility and getaway from the big cities' rush and craziness.
Thank you very much Paul and Ana. We had a great family time!"

Spent the evenings on the big screened in porch (no mosquitoes!) playing cards and eating dinner. Was very relaxing. Bonus was the literal zoo that surrounded us. Donkeys, Mini Horses, goats, Guineafowls, ducks, chickens, very vocal roosters and very vocal peacocks. The night sky is dark and makes for great star watching. Good internet speed and the outdoor kitchen was perfect for our needs. We'll be back for our next fishing trip!"

The kids loved running around the ample outdoor spaces and the neighboring farm animals were also a big hit, especially Anthony the donkey. As the place is split into 2 separate units (upstairs and downstairs) that are only linked by an outdoor staircase large parties may need to plan the sleep arrangements accordingly. We had 2 families traveling together so one family took each apartment. The place was very well stocked and all areas were very clean."

We had the entire home 1st and 2nd floor; it was fully stocked with essentials/supplies, including a washer, dryer, and an outdoor shower! The living room’s, kitchen’s, dining area, bedrooms and bathrooms were magnificent, clean, spacious, gorgeous, well-appointed, and comfortable. The outside porch area was outstanding with a full outdoor kitchen, barbecue grill, very long picnic table, sofa, and chairs.
The fire pits were big enough for the whole family to enjoy a wonderful night. Also, all the outdoor lighting made the night amazing.
The kids had the freedom to run around, and play. They also feed the neighbor’s ranch animals: chickens, roaster’s, goats, pigs, and Anthony the donkey, our favorite. The kids enjoyed feeding Anthony every day, wish they could have brought him home.
The property has everything you need.
Paul was an amazing host. He responded quickly and made sure everything was going well.
The entire Ranch was perfect for our family of six, and to have the opportunity to host a family gathering with my father and sibling’s. It was a blessing, happy times and most importantly the memories being created at Serenity Ranch are priceless!
My father said he will always remember this special day at Serenity Ranch.
Thank you for making our vacation/reunion even more memorable as we were able to capture so many great moments with my father over the weekend.
When checking in follow Paul’s directions, because they are accurate. GPS won’t get you to the entrance of Serenity Ranch."

This is a good place for a family looking to escape the noise of city life and want to relax somewhere as a family where privacy is respected. I would also recommend this place as a good location for a family reunion as there are several areas to congregate together and have a cookout or bonfire. Paul was a very thoughtful and generous host and very approachable. This property is very user friendly and includes a large variety of cooking utensils, and a seriously good oven/stove and barbecue grill. We had a really nice time here and we would like to come again. We just want to note that it would be useful for parents of small children to bring an inflatable bathtub."

Stayed with kids","Our stay here was incredible! Upon arrival we noticed that everything was sparkling clean, and they even went out of their way to mention that the AC filter was cleaned due to COVID. Everything was sanitized and we really appreciated that. They also left us a gift which was a surprise and very nice touch. The property is beautiful, 3 acres all for yourself! The house is equipped with everything you could need and is very spacious. There were 2 great firepits and the animals were a treat for my 3 year old. A bull named Fulanito, a donkey named Anthony and some roosters. Ana, the host, was phenomenal. My daughter accidentally broke something and she did not make it a big deal. Traveling with kids can sometimes lead to some accidents and it was very nice of her to understand these things happen sometimes.
We were a little worried about booking due to the lack of reviews but booking here was the best decision ever. I've stayed at many Airbnbs around the world and this location was top notch. The only downside was when we had to leave and now that we want to return it's fully booked for the next few months. If you're thinking of booking, do not hesitate! Just a few hours from Miami is a completely different world and we cannot wait to return."

Stayed a few nights","This is easily the BEST Airbnb I've stayed in, right from the private road you can already feel it’s coziness. It was absolutely AMAZING how clean the farmhouse was, from the moment you park out front everything just looks pristine.
The house itself is beautiful, the attention to detail really makes you wanna stay there forever, it’s so welcoming and home-like. It’s spacious, extremely clean, equipped with everything you’d need for your stay, they even have both Keurig and traditional coffee maker for you to choose from. The outside area is perfect for family time, it has a full kitchen outside which is perfect for cooking/barbecues, it has a huge table to fit a large family, plenty of lounging areas around with sofas, chairs and an egg swing.
The rooms are nice, the beds very comfortable, and the pillows were great! Every part of the home has a farmhouse feel, they owners truly have invested both time and money into their beautiful home.
There’s entertainment for everyone, from directv to board games. But please don’t stay inside the whole time because there’s so much to explore! They have chickens, and a rooster, who makes sure you get the full ranch experience by serenading you every morning! There are 2 different fire pit areas, and both of them are very fun for a fire night, the one in the back is larger and it was very cool to see such a big fire!
The neighbor ranches have farm animals, they’re precious and look very well taken care of. There is absolutely no bad smell, and all areas look super clean. The town is close by so if you need to make a Walmart run it’s not that far, but in my opinion it’s best to do the shopping beforehand so you can enjoy the tranquility of this ranch in peace, without having to step back out.
The owners left us a bottle of Prosecco, a box of truffle chocolates, and cookies! I mean Seriously? It was the sweetest Christmas gift and such a personal touch!!
I can’t thank them enough for allowing us to celebrate the holidays in their beautiful ranch, family memories were made that we’ll cherish forever. This is definitely a place I’d come back to every chance I get, I’m hooked for life!
Honestly, there are no negatives, even though the wifi didn’t work, we appreciated being able to disconnect and didn’t bother to have it fixed within our stay. You will not regret reserving this ranch!!"

The property is huge, the home itself is nicely decorated with everything you need. The grounds are well kept and clean, the hosts are friendly and quick to respond. The fire pit was a hit with everyone, and loved that the firewood was right there and didn’t have to figure out where to get it. Definitely recommend this place!!!"

Despite the temps in the high 90s every day, the AC worked great and kept the cabin cool. The WiFi worked great and I had good cell coverage on my Verizon phone. Everything worked as it should. We had no issues with anything. Location was convenient, it is about midway between Labelle and Clewiston. There is a Dollar General just a few minutes away for any last minute items you may need. James was great at communicating check in and check out procedures and making sure we had no issues. I highly recommend his cabin and already look forward to staying here in the future."

After I checked out, I sent him a message through Air BNB about something I forgot. Never heard one word from him,except reminding me to leave a review. probably won't be back."

Me , my son , and specially my husband found the places to sit and rest extremely uncomfortable .
Sofa feels that it has rocks inside , futon you can feel its metal rack in your back and hip when you lay down , and the bed it’s just has an old mattress that’s just old and plain uncomfortable. It’s a shame that places to rest were not as confortable as the cabin next door, which we were able to try, and were very comfortable."

Palm trees and a hammock right off your porch! That was my teenagers favorite spot! The pool area just seems like a tropical getaway! Plenty of room to share with other guests! My 9 yr old just loved the loft! And it was easy for Mom to use too! It's not super spacey but that's what we loved about it! Our family of four enjoyed the cabin together! The smell from the well sitting a shower did taking adjusting to, but that was totally expected! We traveled the state quite a bit so didn't spend a full day at this cabin and I'm really upset we didn't! If we ever come back, we will DEFINITELY be staying here! Very responsive hosts when I needed extra linens, which was highly appreciated!! This cabin truly is a Hidden Gem you must stay at! I truly miss it already!"

Stayed a few nights","We expected this cabin to be cute and secluded from the photos and reviews - but I must say it passed all of our expectations! The cabin was perfect for two couples and our dog to unwind, relax, and enjoy the beautiful weather. With an adorable pool area and a few picnic tables - we managed to be outside most of the trip. The property itself is very secluded and makes it feel like a getaway even though we didn’t travel very far from the cities.
The cabins and sit right on the air gliding field so everyday you get to watch the plane take off and watch people air gliding - a very cool addition.
The only tips I will give is you may have to bring some charcoal for the grills, as well as some firewood if you want to use the bonfire area. Also we were lucky to have a breezy weekend and actually left the windows open a lot for fresh air, but the AC didn’t keep the place SUPER cool the first night. So we switched to open windows and lighter pjs.
Also if you need anything don’t be shy to reach out to James. He was very accommodating when we needed a few more pillows and blankets.
Overall we had a beautiful weekend, and our dog loved it too! Would definitely go back for a weekend getaway 🥰"

Planes start going in the morning and fly most of the day. The cabin is very well equipped, you have everything you could need. We enjoyed the upstairs loft a and there is a TV with access to multiple subscriptions, which was convenient. We ended up visiting on a holiday weekend which meant it was more busy, I believe on a regular weekend it would have created a more “secluded feeling” that we were looking for."

Stayed a few nights","Aside from losing power two times, not having WiFi for 80% of the time being there, & the furniture being very out of date and uncomfortable.... it was a really nice time to get away from home and just relax!
When having all the problems that we had during our stay our hosts were very open and were good with their communication. I would not stay here again seeing how we had so many complications but, I’d definitely recommend if you’re looking for a getaway.
If you are wanting to stay here my only suggestion is to be ready for wilderness, it’s literally in the middle of nowhere and can get a-little spooky at night especially if you lose power lol"

The place is a cozy and warm cabin but is smaller than expected. The furniture needs to be replaced and was extremely uncomfortable. The stairs/ladder was difficult to climb up and down (especially if you have pets). The pool area chairs were broken and be mindful of the lack of outdoor lighting making it strange. If it were a little more well maintained, the place would have been a better experience."

Stayed about a week","If you are looking for peace and quiet in a laidback environment, this place fits the bill. The cabin itself has a rustic, comfortable feel. The bedroom is in the loft and there are steep steps, but they've done an excellent job of securing several heavy duty railings that make it a breeze to get up and down. The kitchen is well equipped and we actually made several meals as there are several pots/pans/utensils. The bathroom shower was hot and had good pressure.
The outdoor pool and patio has everything an outdoor person loves....hammocks, rope swings, bbq, camp chairs, fire pit, picnic tables and our favorite cat who we named Tar (black cat). It was amazing to sit on the front porch at night with a bourbon and cigar and star gaze. On the weekend, you get to watch the hang gliders that are in the field right in front of you.
We highly recommend this place if you just want to get away and enjoy a simpler way of life. We loved it!"

Stayed a few nights","This cabin is cute but smaller and more rustic than we anticipated. It is also not very private as there are the owners, hang gliders and other renters right nearby for most of the week. Please also understand that it is right on the florida ridge airsports park site and the cabin is right next to the office. So if you wish to hang glide (ages 12 and up) or sit and watch the hang gliders, you must book to be there between Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday.
The cabin is small and really better for sleeping than hanging out. The bed upstairs can only fit one and the couch bed two, but the pull out bed was uncomfortable and seemed on its last legs. There is a futon upstairs but it also shows great wear so bring any blankets, sheets, pillows and comfort items you might want. The upstairs bed was comfy though and we loved sleeping with the windows open.
Great open fields and sky and star gazing at night. Pool is not heated so it is too cold to swim in the winter months. We enjoyed the hammocks and the owner's pets, who are very friendly and well behaved (two dogs and a cat).
There is no stove so you will need to stove top cook, grill or microwave, or drive 20 to 30 min to nearest town if you want takeout.
Clewiston and La Belle are lovely quaint towns. In Clewiston we enjoyed getting our nails done at ""The Nail Salon""--make an appointment and they are pricey but have great covid protocols. The Clewiston Goodwill is also excellent. We found some great stuff there.
Walking Lake Okeechobee was beautiful and just driving through the sugar was an experience.
You can tour the sugar factory but we didnt want to risk it during covid.
We are considering coming bsck to paddle fisheating creek and hang glide.
The owners are kind, friendly, and responsive.
A good choice if you don't mind rustic, other people, pets, and roughing it a little. Bring what you need since towns are 20 to 30 min away."

Stayed with kids","My family had a great time! We wanted a peaceful camping experience that we could include our dog. And our kids requested a pool. This was the perfect place, we could have all three (camping, dog, and pool)! My husband and I spent most of our days sitting outside, often on the hammock. There is a lot of space to walk around versus being tied to a little camp space and they give the option of a lot of places to sit back and relax, picnic tables, grills, and fire pits. It's pretty fun to sit outside at night and listen for the cows at the farm next door. Inside space had everything we needed to live for a few days and we brought a lot of our own food to make. We did get pizza from a place across the road and we went into town to get bbq at The Log Cabin. We also went into Clewiston to walk through Civic Park. We considered doing more activities but really just found ourselves enjoying our time there that we didn't feel the desire to get out much. Only issue is we tried to have a family movie night but the wifi connection to the tv wasn't great so the movie kept cutting out. Not really that big of a deal for us since our point of the trip was to unplug and get outside more. But if you need an internet connection it might be spotty. If you stay on a weekend you may get the pleasure of watching the hang gliding, we were able to watch a couple flights on the morning we left and I really could've watched that all day. The people who live onsite are also really friendly and there is currently a dog who likes to welcome guests. If we were not moving out of state in a couple months I'm sure we'd come back. Thank you for the experience!"

The area is perfect for late afternoon walks when you can feel a wonderful breeze and not too hot. I highly recommend the on site hang gliding it’s an experience you will never forget! We are already planning our next trip back for my birthday and will be trying out their other cabin.

I worked remotely during some of our stay. The desk was a nice touch & made it so convenient. The kitchen was well stocked & seriously had ANYTHING you would ever need to fix good meals if you like to eat in like my family does! The owner reached out almost immediately when I asked for check in information. We’ve been coming to Lake Okeechobee for the past several years & this has been our best experience to date!

The host was good about communicating and responding until we checked in. The tv remote was not the right one for the tv, a room had no light bulbs in it so there was no light, and when we walked in the Airbnb it was 89 degrees because the air had been kept off and it took a while to cool down. Lastly, access to the patio is falsely advertised. It belongs to a family that lives next door and is not apart of the Airbnb. Not the best experience for my family and I."

Stayed a few nights","Very basic accommodations. It was fine, nothing luxurious, perfect for someone not planning to spend much time there. It could have been a little cleaner, splatters on the kitchen walls, residue on some things, etc like it hadn’t been deep cleaned in a while. The biggest issue was that there were no cooking utensils or knives except butter knives and no salt/pepper, so even though there’s a kitchen, I wouldn’t plan on cooking anything."

Stayed a few nights","Apartment was not brand new, but adequate for our needs and a great value for the money. It has been recently renovated but still has some character from the orginal build. The local hotel was charging $180/night for a reguler room and this was less than $75/night for a 2bd/ 1ba apt. It was in a good part of town and conveniently located to everything. Couldnt have asked for a better stay~! Thanks Eric~!"

Stayed with kids",Eric's place is so comfortable you forget it's an apartment. The gecko's are everywhere so make sure to close the doors. 1 got in during our stay. Ha! Ha! They are harmless so it was fun for the kids. The mosquitoes in Clewiston are nothing to play with. Bring lots of insect repellent. The apartment was very spacious for my family.

Stayed over a week","Eric is a very friendly host and truly makes an effort to accommodate his guests without hesitation. We asked Eric for several needed items for the kitchen and bath and he got them right away. We truly appreciated his hospitality and know you will as well! Unfortunately upon arrival we were taken aback by the badly stained carpet throughout the main living area which should be replaced as it is NOT acceptable. AIRBnB accommodations in this area are limited and Eric’s place, which is in a nice neighborhood, is very close to the truck route through town and neighboring business’s lighting. We strongly recommend for Eric to get new room darkening window treatments for these rooms as it is impossible to block out the disruptive lights through the night with Eric’s present broken blinds. We do want to share that we were not disappointed with our enjoyment of numerous TV networks and the very nice kitchen and dining area in which to enjoy cooking in during our stay.
It was appreciated to be able to park right in front of the entrance to the rental unit and Eric was also most helpful in letting us have some mail and packages delivered there during our stay."

Stayed one night","I was staying in the apartment with my friends for 1 night. Apartment is nice, clean, has everything what can be needed, also in a good location. Eric provides detail instruction how to open the door, parking space was also available right in front of the house. Communication with Eric was good, fast replays and always open to help.
Thanks a lot Eric!"
