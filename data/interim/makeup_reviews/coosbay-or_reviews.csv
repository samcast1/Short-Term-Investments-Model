Stayed a few nights","Sully's Sanctuary is a great getaway place when visiting the Oregon Coast! Centrally located in a neighborhood that reflects the small town charm of North Bend and Coos Bay, it's an ideal base camp for exploring the many parks and beaches along Hwy 101 or the many shops in the various coastal towns. Everything was as described and is ideal for couples or solo travelers. Hostess with the Mostest Shannyn was very responsive and helpful with questions, so feel free to ask her for ideas. Two thumbs up!"

Stayed one night","The unit was very spacious with a large bathroom, sleeping area and kitchen with plenty of room to sit and eat meals. The kitchen was well-stocked with coffee, creamer, dishes/silverware and some spices as well as a small refrigerator. The unit is tucked off of the street with a private parking area and was very quiet, which is a must for a light sleeper like me. The owner was very responsive and allowed us to drop our luggage off prior to the cleaners being finished. I would definitely stay here again."

The special touches throughout this airbnb were extremely thought out from soap options to carefully placed tealights, mats for the beach, etc. Never do I ever go barefoot anywhere except my own home, but I'd feel confident in this airbnb, that's how clean it is! Unfortunately, our visit wasn't for pleasure, but when in this bungalow, it almost felt like we were from the peaceful vibe inside. I really couldn't have asked for a better place to stay and am so grateful this was our pick. We will 100% stay here again! Thank you, Shannyn, for the lovely retreat like space! :)"

Stayed one night","Stayed for one night at Sully’s Sanctuary but would have loved to have visited longer! We were greeted with a beautiful, tastefully appointed guest suite which is larger than pictured. A warm electric fireplace adds heat & ambience to the space. The unit is attached to the primary/owner’s dwelling but it felt very quiet & private. Shannyn has anticipated the needs of her guests (Keurig coffee/tea/dairy & oat milk options, etc.) and, although there is no sink in the kitchenette area, filtered water is provided in ample quantities. Spacious bathroom with double sinks & a variety of soaps/toiletries. We appreciated the helpful photos/instructions on finding Sully’s Sanctuary which we did on attempt #2 (our error—not Shannyn’s). Great value for price & would definitely stay again when in the area :)"

Respond time is almost immediate when you reach out to her. The mattress and bedding is super comfortable and Shannyn has done an ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL job in decorating this AirBnB!

That was really felt immediately on arrival and I really appreciated that. She was a great communicator and explained all of the details about the space very clearly. I genuinely think this spot is a gem and if I come visit the area again I will definitely book Sully’s Sanctuary again.

Shannyn was incredibly helpful and gave great recommendations after a very long day of travel. I really appreciate her helpfulness! I highly recommend her place and look forward to coming back!

Our host, Shannyn, left nothing to want or need… her communication was spot on and her creativeness in providing a place of total comfort and peace is extraordinary. The description and pictures are exactly what is provided. I literally kept finding little things that made me smile. Thank you for a GREAT stay!!!"

Stayed one night","We stayed here for our anniversary get away, and it was truly special and cute as a button! Not only was it incredible private, quiet, and comfortable, but it was decorated and stocked with a high level of taste and thoughtfulness. We arrived to chocolate truffles on the dresser and chilled water in the fridge. two luggage stands made it so we didn't have to bend over to access our suitcases (bonus for older folks). The kitchenette and bathroom had everything you could ask for, and MORE. I stubbed my toe and was about to send my husband to the store for Band-Aids, but I found a full first aid kit under the bathroom sink. So thoughtful and handy! We had dinner on the porch, and the coastal breezes were heavenly. We would definitely stay again!"

My SO and I came down to North Bend to take part in King Tides. We couldn't have lucked out better than having Shannyn as a host and Sully's Retreat as a space to unwind each day.
Shannyn was responsive, and engaging. The property was relaxing, and the amenities were well appointed. Shannyn has great taste, great style!
She was also accommodating in working with us to simply get into the space and make King Tides weekend wonderful; she come through with local recommendations and insights.
10/10 recommend the space to anyone interested. We WILL be back!

Stayed a few nights","Shannyn is a host who truly understands and upholds the concept of hospitality. The studio is beautifully maintained and actually larger than I expected, with three separate rooms. The bathroom is huge, and has two sinks...as a solo or couple, you will have plenty of space. I loved that there was a cart with shelves in bathroom where I could set out my toiletries, hair accessories, etc. The kitchenette covered all of my basic needs, and there were both caffeinated and decaf selections for the coffee maker. Ample clothes hangers in the closet, and plenty of towels in the bathroom. The shower was sparkling clean and stocked with nice soap, shampoo, and conditioner brands, including products for sensitive skin. I found the location ideal for getting to locations in both Coos Bay and North Bend, and the parking spot is very easy to get in and out of. The bed is slightly firm, but very comfortable with a couple of different types of pillows to choose from. One detail to bear in mind is that the studio has skylights, so if you are very sensitive to light in your sleeping area you might consider an eye cover if the sun wakes up before you do. I will absolutely try to book this accommodation the next time I am in the area."

The only caveat is that the room is directly attached to the owner’s house. Which is totally fine and we knew that going in. But we weren’t aware just how clearly we’d be able to hear the host through the door. It was almost like she was standing right behind the door that attaches the two residences. We spoke in whispers almost the whole stay because it felt kind of awkward. If something like that doesn’t bother you though, this is definitely a 5-star stay!"

But… this did not affect the quality of our time spent together in this beautiful place.

The studio is beautifully located in its own secluded space in their backyard, surrounded by trees, shrubbery, and a tall wood fence. The house is well-designed and organized, with a large living/sleeping area and nicely-designed kitchen space. The bathroom is small, but has a sturdy Kohler sink, and a beautifully-tiled shower. It was very clean and fresh inside with huge windows, comfortable bed, and swivel easy chair. The kitchen functioned very well for us, with a stainless steel sink, microwave in a cabinet under the counter, coffeemaker and coffee, and a tiny fridge/freezer. I had wondered if it would feel a little damp inside the house, being so close to the bay, but it was dry and cozy, even during a rain shower. We would definitely stay here again."

They sent us all the info ahead of time so we could easily roll in after a long day of motorcycling for a seamless check in. Cameron happened to be outside when we arrived and was very friendly, let us know they were right next door if we needed anything. The space is perfect, light and airy and every detail has been thought out, even the small things- we walked back from dinner in town (17 minutes) and were impressed to find the automatic timed lights lit our path in the dark. Would absolutely stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","The cottage seems new & was cute, very clean & cozy! The backyard was tranquil, lush & pretty. The bed was comfortable. However, the first night the neighbor guy on other side of fence stayed outside on deck until about 11 listening to loud music. We actually liked the songs, but it was very loud for that time of night & sleeping (even with all windows & doors shut). The second night it was extremely quiet & peaceful. There is an outdoor sitting area & even a fire pit.
We brought our own food & were able to cook. There is a microwave, coffee maker, hot water kettle, mini fridge, & hot plate w/ 1 pot & 1 pan.
We didn’t spend a lot of time at cottage during day as we were busy exploring the area. We basically just had breakfast, headed out for the day & returned for hot showers, dinner & sleeping. We highly recommend visiting Shore Acres! There are gorgeous gardens there, hiking trails, beaches, coastal views etc. It was a really enjoyable place to savor all things nature"

The studio was so clearly put together with the utmost care and thoughtfulness. It included the basics of everything you need with a few extras (shampoo, conditioner, body wash, coffee and a couple of snacks) it had a comfortable Queen bed, cozy bedding, it was quiet and also had a nice fan provided for additional white noise. It was extremely clean and as someone who is sensitive to artificial fragrance I so appreciated that it was minimal and the bedding did not smell of fabric softener. The side entrance and back yard seclusion make it feel private and cozy. Great location, beautiful and relaxing space and excellent host descriptions, communication and nicely curated space. We will be back!"

Stayed one night","I’ve never considered booking an Airbnb in Coos Bay as we normally visit to go riding and camp, however if you’re looking to get the dune experience and still have the comfort of a house, this place is perfectly located just across the bridge from Horsefalls and Boxcar. We came over this time for a quick crabbing trip and we ended up booking this location due to the limited options available in Bandon, but the drive was well worth the comfort and cleanliness we experienced during our stay. I wanted to take a moment to appreciate the level of flexibility from Mindy and Cameron - after explaining our plans for arrival time (long before normal check-in for this location), they worked to get the location cleaned and ready for us much sooner. Obviously this is something that was not required of them, but we were very greatfull that they were willing to work with us. We would definitely recommend this Airbnb to others and would stay here again ourselves. Thanks again Mindy and Cameron!"

Nestled behind a house in a very quiet (tucked away as you say) neighborhood, you park your car along the street, and just follow that hedge around to your spot. Easy. The place itself is clean, open room with simple kitchen stuff, and some snacks too! We LOVED the bed, super soft yet firm and not all worn in like an elephant slept there the night before (not even a small elephant). Really glad we chose to stay there,even though it was a bit pricey for us for a place without a full kitchen and when you throw in all the extra fees."

Everything felt brand new and it was very clean. It’s a small space, not enough room for more than two people. Queen sized, firm mattress. A tower fan space heater was provided as the heat source, we didn’t use it so can’t speak to effectiveness. There was a powerful floor fan to move air and cool the space however it was fairly loud. Bathroom was brand new, small pedestal sink with no counter space. Backyard where the bungalow is located is very quiet and private, instructions to go along the pathway were very clear. Overall I’d recommend staying here for a quick one-night stopover."

Stayed a few nights","Cameron & Mindy’s unit was a lovely place to visit and looks as described in their listing. Check-in was easy, you just walk through the gate on the side of the owner’s house and down into their pretty back yard where the studio is located. From there you just type in the lockbox password and you’re all set. :-)
The unit was really clean, and well stocked, and was in a quiet neighborhood away from any road noise. The shower had plenty of hot water and there were thoughtful touches to make a guest’s stay comfortable. It’s also in a good location for many restaurants and things to do in North Bend.
A fan and a space heater are provided for climate control. The fan works really well and is a bit noisy, so we opted to crack open the windows at night while we slept to keep things cool. The only downside (and totally not the owner’s fault) was that the local wild birds can be very loud in the morning and start very early.
All in all, we had a good experience and are thankful to Cameron & Mindy for a pleasant stay! :-)"

I've stayed in many rentals but Lisa's place is the only place where we did not have to go buy tissue paper, laundry detergent, garbage bags.. etc. Everything was stocked nicely. I love that we were able to check in whenever we wanted since it was already empty and such a HUGE PLUS that we didnt have to be out by 10am and there was NO checkout list. I felt a bit odd leaving without stripping beds, washing dishes, towels and emptying garbage. This was a very relaxing stay. Lisa was amazing, responsive and a very warm host. We enjoyed the snack basket while kicking back and watching movies. Thank you Lisa for a great stay! Ill be back for a long term stay next year!"

Beds and pillows were very comfortable, like a good hotel. I liked the skylight too.
Carpet felt lush, couches are obviously new and very cozy. No lack of large flat screen TV'S!
Kitchen had everything we needed, plus a pleasant surprise of a little basket of treats.
An added bonus to do a load of laundry. I don't remember if Lisa provides detergent, we brought our own.
The house was just as expected from the pictures provided. The focus is not on it being an outdoor retreat, but Lisa has not pretended that it is, and it suited our needs well for a 1 night stay on a road trip. It is conveniently located, clean, roomy, and comfortable We appreciated finding a place that did not have a 2 night minimum."

It was only for 2 nights, but it was less than getting rooms at a hotel and for 6 women, it was great to have the space. The home is comfortable and clean.

Colorful & well appointed, with everything necessary to make a comfortable stay, including linens, soaps & kitchen essentials. And VERY spacious. Two TV sitting rooms, two dining tables, a large master suite at one end of the house plus 3 bedrooms/2 baths off the front hallway (1 ensuite & 2 single rms w/hall bath). The galley kitchen is smallish, but definitely adequate & fully stocked for on site cooking. Easy to find & handy location with a car. We explored the different waterfronts, but really came to visit the Shore Acres State Park which was about a 20 minute drive away. Our hosts were accessible & responded quickly.
Many thanks to our hosts, Teri & Crew, for a great experience!"

There is plenty of space to spread out and be comfortable with your family. Plenty of towels and double washer/dryer to do laundry. Teri was always quick in response to my questions and has really updated the home to feel cozy and welcoming. The kitchen has everything we needed and the outdoor propane fireplace and deck lights made it relaxing and inviting. Directions were clear and frequent emails during our stay helped keep us on track. Coos Bay is where we grew up visiting grandparents and so to come back and visit brought all the feels! Definitely would stay here again! Thanks Teri! - Kathy from Seattle"

Note here: that the flip side of this is that restaurants / entertainment options are a (short) drive to downtown - The Room was exactly as advertised, as depicted in the pictures, clean and comfortable. In addition, the room comes equipped with a nice 40"" tv with a plethora of options from Netflix to Disney+ to pick from. Bathroom is shared with other 2 other Airbnb guests/rooms (depending on if the place is full) but everyone was friendly, and this did not pose any issues for me. Kelsea made herself available to ensure a smooth check-in, and was warm and friendly. I would def. recommend a stay here during your time in Coos Bay."

Stayed one night","This is a pretty spacious bedroom in a nice house in Coos Bay. You share the bathroom with the other airbnb guest in a room across the hall (I think this room is the nicer bedroom honestly). I only stayed one night as part of my road trip, but the house seemed nice with a cool yard/garden. Neighborhood was decent too. Only downside for me was that the heat was kept higher than my preference ( (I like it cool). The heating system was those electric ceiling heat coils (I used to have an apartment with this). It wasn't clear if I could turn it off for the room specifically."

Vicki provided lots of extra little touches that were very thoughtful- she had turned on several small lamps and the porch light since we were planning to arrive after dark. There was coffee and creamer when we arrived along with a few bottles of water, the kitchen also had a good variety of spices, and oil for cooking, which saved us a trip to the grocery store. There were a few travel-size toiletries available if we had forgotten our own and plenty of extra linens and blankets if we needed them.
The back porch would be a great place to hang out and relax - though it was a bit chilly to sit long in late October.
We will definitely look to stay here again on any future trips to the Coos Bay area!"

Stayed a few nights","The cottage is perfect for a long weekend getaway (or even an extended stay). My friend and I were impressed with the cleanliness, amenities, and abundance of kitchen and bath supplies and linens. The appliances are newer and well cared for (including a washer and dryer). There's even a nice coffee and tea station for guests. There was more than enough room for the two of us, and Vicki has done an excellent job of making the cottage feel cozy, welcoming, and like a home away from home. She was very responsive to my messages and easy to communicate with.
The cottage is located less than half a mile from downtown Coos Bay, so we walked to the Visitors Center and Boardwalk. Mingus Park is right down the street from the cottage, and it has a very nice Japanese garden style large pond/small lake with ducks, a walking path, and trails into more wooded areas of the park.
Check in and check out was super easy, and there is off-street parking in the back of the house. If only the weather had been a bit warmer, we would have taken our meals on the very pleasant back patio, which is complete with a a table and seating for four, a small fountain and lights. The neighborhood is entirely residential and very quiet.
I would recommend Mingus Park Cottage in a heartbeat for anyone who wants a delightful home base to explore Coos Bay and the southern Oregon Coast."

I needed a comfortable place for my parents, who are in their 80's, and they could not have been happier there. The beds are very comfortable, and my mother loved the heater/fireplace in the living room. She would sit and watch the birds fly in and out of the birdhouse in the front yard, quite warm and comfortable. The kitchen is large and well stocked, and the back patio is just lovely to sit and relax. It is just across from Mingus Park which is a very nice park to take a stroll. My daughter and I walked into town from the house as well, so it's very convenient for that as well. Great stay all the way around, and Vicki was quick to respond to any need we had.

My family couldn't have been happier with the cottage. It was very clean, comfortable and had everything a visitor could possibly want or need: a nicely stocked kitchen, plenty of linens, reliable wifi, Netflix, DVDs, board games, and comfortable beds. Vicki was very responsive and even provided some great restaurant and activity recommendations. My family and I really enjoyed our stay here."

Stayed one night","This was one of my favorite Airbnbs ever. Pictures don't really show how beautiful it is. It's in a quiet, lovely neighborhood. It was so spacious and clean. The King size bed and linens were extremely comfortable. It's got a huge walkin closet, but my favorite was the huge bathroom with a Jacuzzi tub. The jets were not working, but it was so wonderful to soak in that tub. There's all kinds of luxurious things to add to the pampering...bath salts, great soaps , shampoos, conditioner, lotion, large fluffy towels, and in the bedroom a heater and many soft blankets to choose from.
It's conveniently close to town. We never heard noise from the host side of the house, so felt very private. Did not meet Miyeong, but she was so kind and quick with communication. Thank you, Miyeong!"

I have one suggestion, if I may. It would compliment your air bnb if there was a cute little table with 2 chairs right in the kitchenette area. Plus provide a place for sitting down to eat if those like me wanted to stay in nstead of eating out.
I love this studio and will hope to book again for a return trip."

Negative (for me) I am super-sensitive to scents and perfumes and found the sheets quite strong-smelling. But the space was just right for our basic needs and quick overnight stay."

The apartment was very spacious and the bathroom was massive. Coupled with the king size bed, Miyeong’s space was extremely relaxing. The check in went perfectly and was very flexible for our late arrival. Lastly the price was a steal. I will definitely be keeping and eye out for this apartment the next time I visit the Oregon coast."

The home sits on top of a hill, so we had a nice view of the town, the bay, the bridge and the hosts' nice backyard. The first morning we enjoyed some complimentary coffee from the Keurig while sitting in front of the open door. What a nice, peaceful way to start the day. Once we got up to get ready and explore, we had no problem sharing the large bathroom together. We came to North Bend/Coos Bay mainly to dine at Restaurant O, but our stay here was the cherry on top. We hope we can stay here again next time we are in the area. Thank you Miyeong!"

Stayed a few nights","excellent stay! it was cozy, but plenty of room for a romantic weekend for 2! the bed was huge & super comfy, the TV was quite large & nicely placed, w lots to watch. the bathroom was my favorite! the tub was big enough 4 my husband & me after a long day on the beach (& thats a first!), & the shower was very nice! only thing I had an issue w was the windows were cracked @ the bottom w no visible way of closing them all the way, so we had 2 block it with towels so people cldn't see our private bits lol but it was super nice, they even had a lil keurig w a bazillion coffee pods, & tea bags, & bottled water. we didn't even get a chance 2 sit on the back deck & admire the really pretty view of the neighborhood out back. wish theyd been avaliable 1 more day so we ddnt have 2 stay in the crappy hotel in Reedsport the nxt day. will definitely look 4 this place the next time we visit Coos Bay! thanks 4 making our first vacation special!"

Stayed one night","I am happy to find a place I can stay when I travel to the area for work - I’m not a big fan of the roadside motels or larger motels in the area.
This is part of their home with a separate entrance in the back of the home. It consists of a bedroom with a king bed with super comfy bedding, an entryway area that has a mini fridge with bottled water and coffee creamer, a Kuerig and a microwave. Some paper plates, cups, napkins and plastic utensils, coffee pods, sugars included, as well. There is a walk in closet and a large bathroom with a large jetted tub, a separate dual head shower and double sinks.
I didn’t hear the owners in their home at all (though I believe they were home).
Additions that would be helpful would be a full sized mirror in the closet, and an iron and ironing board for business travelers (like me)."

The owner can’t seem to find someone to fix it but she should not still advertise it on her listing if it doesn’t work cause it’s false advertising. That’s why I made the reservation after a hard week of work only to be told it doesn’t work while I was sitting in it. You can still take a bath but there’s no jets. Otherwise this was a nice private place to stay.

Surrounding area is nice if you’re up for low key nights (which we definitely were). Lovely little cafes, antique shops, and great breakfast and seafood."

The interior of the home is eclectic and fun, there was so much to look at. This house was also priced very fairly for the amazing views from the bedroom and back of the house. I wish the weather had been nicer so we could have enjoyed the deck more."

Stayed with kids","This was an amazing house. It was charming for our five person family. We loved hanging out on the deck watching the water and also using the grill. The kitchen was a wonderful chef’s kitchen and we used it to enjoy a few home cooked meals. The master bedroom had a great bay view and the boys enjoyed the bunk beds in the other room. The house had everything we needed, was very clean, and Chloe and Jason were very responsive. Even after the trip they helped me because I made a mistake and sent an Amazon package there because the address was in my history, and they agreed to help get it to me.
We stayed there because my son and I played Bandon while my wife and other two sons stayed behind. An easy 30 min drive onto the resort, and I’ll be back again and hope the house is available!"

Stayed with kids","We had a very lovely stay in this house. It was a bit smaller than we had expected, but I think it was because the mirrors in the house make it look much bigger. It was plenty big for our family of 5 though. The house was very clean and all of the necessities were provided. The kitchen was well stocked and we cooked just about every day here. It was so lovely to have a cup of coffee and watch the boats going in and out of the bay. It was super cool to watch the fishing/crabbing boats each morning when the tide was low. There isn't a whole lot to do in North Bend, but the beaches and sand dunes are a short drive from the house. There are a couple of parks close by (one is right in the neighborhood) that we took the kids to and they had so much fun. If I had to pick one thing to complain about in the house it would be the uncomfortable pillows. And this is just a personal preference so it's really not a big deal. But if you are picky about your pillows, just bring your own is my suggestion. :) I would definitely book a stay again here in the future."

The neighborhood is very quiet and there’s a park close by you can walk to. The view of the bay was super peaceful and relaxing with a morning cup of coffee. The living room seating has just one love seat, so we found ourselves taking turns between the couch and the dining chairs/bar stools. There are two mini refrigerators in the main home and a full side refrigerator with freezer in the garage. Unique setup but worked for us. Chloe and Jason are very quick to respond to any questions or concerns. When we arrived the propane was out in the bbq. I let them know and that same day (within hours) they dropped off and hooked up a new tank. Great experience. Would book again."

Great place to stay, comfortable and clean.

We were traveling with a 15 month old and asked if there was a playpen onsite for her to sleep in. We were fine to purchase one but before we could I had an email letting me know one was ordered for us. The home was so clean, location was great and the view was amazing! We're planning a return trip in a couple of months and keeping our fingers crossed this home will be available for our return extended trip.
Thank you Chloe & Jason for sharing this beautiful home with my family."

Great heating systems which were needed due to the cold snap.
Hosts, Kelsea & Kate, were very friendly & very reactive to any queries.
Some of the best hosts we have ever encountered in many years using Airbnb & other casual rental properties.
We had a minor problem with the electronic entry pad but on phoning Kelsea, she and Kate came almost immediately to investigate & correct the electronic problem which wasn't of their doing.
We mentioned there appeared to be a shortage of a teaspoon and a knife, which we said wasn't a problem to us but maybe could be corrected for future guests.
Despite that comment, they very quickly delivered a complete new cutlery set, to ensure we were fully satisfied.
The off-street parking and use of washer and dryer were very nice touches as was the availability of basic kitchen utensils & ingredients.
We would definitely use this home again if we were in the area."

Loved the fireplace insert which was the only thing I used for heat along with the wall heater in the bathroom for showers on chilly mornings. The location was very quiet and in a walkable neighborhood where I felt safe walking my dog in the evenings. I was pleasantly surprised the first evening when we went for a walk and found a back entrance to Mingus Park which is where we would start our mornings with a walk and where we met several wonderful people that we got in a habit of walking with. I didn't want to leave!

Stayed a few nights","The place was clean, organized, easy to find and quiet. Parking was okay, but there were issues with other guests in the main house taking all the available spots in front of my booking.
The biggest drawbacks to this place were the TV, which was mounted too high to comfortably watch and had awful sound quality and the bed in the bedroom wasn’t very sturdy and as a result one of us had to sleep in the living room.
During most of the stay, we found it difficult to use the washer and dryer, as it was always filled with bed sheets and blankets from the main house.
Overall, the space was nice, but the core amenities to make sleeping and relaxing were lacking in quality and accessibility."

The neighborhood is quiet and a pleasant area for dog walking. It's near Mingus Park and just a short drive to some great restaurants in downtown Coos Bay and along the waterfront.
The apartment was clean and comfortable and has plenty of space. I appreciated the big window that looks into the backyard where I could see the flowering dogwood in bloom. Having access to the large fenced yard was wonderful because it made traveling with my little dog so much easier. The yard has lots of mature landscaping which makes it an interesting and very private space. My dog liked exploring the yard while I hung out. And we both enjoyed meeting Kate and her dog Pippin!
We'll be back. 🙂

Stayed a few nights","Kate's home is cozy, the kitchen and bathroom are well-stocked and the backyard is so lovely. Access to laundry is a bonus too! The neighborhood is quiet, safe, and peaceful, and the house is a short walk to Mingus Park. We loved our stay and would recommend Kate's home to anyone passing through Coos Bay."

Stayed one night","We booked at the very last second but Kate was so understanding, accommodating and helpful! She even allowed us to check in a bit early, which was much appreciated!
Her home was decorated in a tasteful, coastal vibe and had fun details throughout.
We were so glad for the hot shower and the on-site laundry to freshen up.
Staying was a breeze and was a much needed reprieve from a long, well spent day tide pooling and exploring. We hope to come back soon!"

Stayed one night","Overall, it wasn’t what we were expecting but it did the job. It was attached to a garage that was in use, the alleyway was a bit difficult to find, and it didn’t feel clean given the hefty cleaning fee. The open, used barsoaps were left out on the bathroom sink. Brita filter needs to be replaced."

Stayed with a pet","We were in Coos Bay to watch our niece play in the state basketball play-offs. Kate’s place was perfect for our needs. The central location was great since we had games at both North Bend and Coos Bay high schools and it is close to eateries and grocery stores. The apartment is connected to the main house with a garage between, so it is peaceful and quiet. Kate and her crew were quick to respond to questions and made us feel very welcome. Furniture and bedding was very clean and comfortable. The kitchen is well-equipped and we enjoyed the picture window view of the backyard. It is full of wonderful mature trees and shrubs that will be even more beautiful in bloom! It was completely fenced and perfect for our large puppy’s outdoor time. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again!"

It was the perfect amount of space for my wife and our dogs and had everything we needed, kitchen and bathroom. Kate’s check in instructions were also very clear and easy to follow. Highly recommended!"

Stayed one night","Kate’s place is very nice, spacious and very calm. The neighborhood is calm too.
You can do laundry easily with everything provided, you also have a nice garden to access.
Regarding the location, it’s great to have a car or you’ll have to walk about 20-30 minutes to go for commodities. Otherwise you also have cheap taxis (about 10$).
I recommend this place :)"

Everything is beautiful and clean. I also loved that I could use a washer and dryer. I was able to comfortably work from Kate's place. It's very quiet and peaceful and in a safe neighborhood, too. Great for staying with a dog and walking around. Kate was a wonderful host and was very friendly and responsive. I highly recommend staying here and I will definitely be back!"

Hosts are communicative and the front door lock is accessed via a simple app. The bathroom had a nice shower upon first glance but it was not clean which made me uncomfortable.

There is a lovely view of the yard from the unit. I was there in November, and I enjoyed the changing colors of the trees. I needed to work while I was there, and the wi-fi was great throughout my visit which I really appreciated. There are two tables so I was able to have a work station and not have to stare at my computer while I was eating which I appreciated."

Stayed with a pet","Kate's place was fantastic. Went to Coos Bay for our anniversary and everything was just perfect - even a bottle of wine upon arrival for our anniversary. The kitchen had everything you need, the bathroom was well stocked and the bed was quite comfortable. The decor is appropriately beachy and was neat as a pin. The location is centrally located and close to all the area has to offer and even had maps and interesting event brochures about local activities. Kate was easy to reach and quick to respond to questions. Overall we couldn't have been happier with our stay. Can't wait to return!"

Location was great too, just a few minutes drive to downtown. We appreciated all the extra touches and details to make our stay all the more comfortable. Thank you Kate, and I highly recommend this place for anyone traveling down the coast, looking for a better option than the area's hotels."

Stayed a few nights","This Airbnb feels more like a vacation rental then the other places I’ve stayed at through Airbnb. The place smells brand new. Beautiful glass shower and modern appliances. I loved opening the bedroom window and looking at the architectural home next door it reminded me of a set from a movie. Also there wasn’t a chore list which made it feel more like a vacation rental. Definitely would stay here again, Kate was very accommodating with extending my stay.😀"

Very responsive host and good communicator. I would recommend this place. One night of my stay I encountered one of those rare technical glitches with the electronic key pad, but Kate was totally responsive when I texted her and she acted quickly and decisively to resolve the problem. I would certainly stay here again. Did I mention clean? The place was spotless. Very nice."

Stayed one night","This was an adorable, comfortable spot to stay. The view of the backyard to the main house was gorgeous and the apartment was furnished beautifully and the bed was comfortable. Because it is located off of an alley, it was very quiet and dark at night which was ideal for sleeping.
The only downside was that the spot by the front door was taken when I arrived and I needed to park on the street and walk to the door. This was not a huge problem as the neighborhood was very, very safe.
I will defintely stay again next time I am in Coos Bay."

Kate was responsive regarding the issue. Overall, I enjoyed my stay."
