Stayed about a week","I can’t overstate what a great location this is. Walkable doesn’t do it justice. From the back balcony you can scope how busy three different restaurants are. Very comfortable to work, play, and live. 10/10 would recommend. The “garage tv room” made for great Masters & people watching. Lively neighborhood, but not loud"

Stayed a few nights","This house is in a prime location: just a couple blocks from Hyde Park restaurants and Camel's Back Park, but on a quiet street. The house is new, modern, clean, and very comfortable. There is a ton of natural light throughout the home. It's a great value for the location and space. I would recommend it to family and friends."

Stayed a few nights","Let's start with the pros:
- check-in is quick, clear, according to the instructions issued
- the apartment is very spacious, bright and bright
- in general, there is all amenities for a comfortable stay
- nice bed
- great internet
- a cursed kitchen
- good location - you can walk (Capitol, restaurants, churches)
- Free parking close to the house
I would recommend this apartment if you are in Boise.
Of course, there are disadvantages, of course.
Since the house is not new, respectively, there may be problems with the wiring, as we had when we decided to turn on the microwave and kettle at the same time. Then it cut off some of the outlets and nothing helped. I had to use my extension cord.
But plus, the host was in touch and tried to resolve the issue. I hope so did.
Another disadvantage: since the house is at a rather busy track, be prepared for the fact that an ambulance or a police machine can pass by. This is rather a disadvantage for those with sensitive sleep."

Stayed a few nights","Unique space that met my needs for my 1 person trip. I left each day by 9:30am and returned midnight or later. Conveniently close (3-4 blocks, <10 min walk) to a local hotel where I was attending a multi day seminar.
Full kitchen was useful, especially the blender to make morning smoothies. I couldn’t get the Keurig to work though, so no coffee every morning.
Bathroom was clean but needs updating. Ceiling tiles were stained and shower was so small that the shower curtain sticking to me when I turned.
Bed was warm and comfortable but sagged in the middle. No bedroom closet to hang clothes.
Living room was spacious and had a nice large tv. Couch and recliner were comfortable. Dining table in the living room served well as my work desk every night and morning. Good lighting.
Front door was drafty, gaps around door, loud noise from very busy State Street.
Host was responsive and helpful. No flexibility though when I requested a late (additional 90 min) checkout."

Stayed a few nights","The location is great, walking distance do the downtown area, lots of good restaurants nearby. The house was definitely old. It was clean, but there were a number of things that were in poor condition, ceiling areas with water damage, holes in walls, covered by tape and manila folder, missing outlet etc. There were also electrical problems. Some of the outlets would trip, and it was difficult to tell which GFI to reset. We stayed in Nov, and it was cold in the house, they did provide two ceramic heaters, but overall it felt drafty. Hot water for showers also was a little iffy. So overall my experience was meh. I probably won't stay there again. The house has a lot of potential though, with some repair and remodeling, it could be a really fun spot in a great location."

Aaron and Kelly provided great communication, even videos on where to park and how to enter. They were also very quick to respond to all queries. Only drawback would be if you're a light sleeper as the large master bedroom is right on the main street so you hear traffic and conversations of passers by."

It's close enough to the downtown convention spaces to be a good place to stay during a conference, and close enough to grocery stores and parks to be fun. It's spacious enough to just hang out and recover from jet lag. There's even a check-in video that helps avoid parking tickets. And the host reached out to make sure our first night went ok. Wow. Couldn't be better."

Stayed a few nights","The location is great! It’s tucked away from the city center but still great walking distance to everything. I think we used Uber one time in the whole weekend, we walked everywhere else!
The place itself is clean and tidy and equipped with the basics you may need. We spent most of our time out and about exploring but we were very comfortable coming home and relaxing in the evening! The AC gets very noisy in the back bedroom, so if you’re a light sleeper I’d just turn it off and turn the fan on for the evenings! Overall we’d definitely stay here again and were happy with our choice!"

The occupant of the unit directly below keeps the TV going all night long. The owners did try to contact them but it was not until the last night that they finally turned the TV off.
Not one baking pan in the kitchen. We had to go out and buy a disposable one.
One kitchen cabinet had a broken hinge and was held together by twine.
Window blinds are awful and need to be replaced. Shower is tiny and very little water pressure."

2 potentially minor things, the roads are pretty busy and therefore a little loud in the apartment. Luckily it was quiet at night. Secondly, the shower is very small! I'm a relatively thin 6'2'' and while it totally worked, but was a bit cramped.
Overall, this place is exactly as described and my stay was good. Thank you!"

It's clean, comfy bed, great TV and kitchen well outfitted. The doors felt a little loose but they locked fine. Really great location; walking distance to downtown and Hyde Park areas."

Stayed a few nights","I’m giving a five star review, which I think is justified. The house is comfortable and well-appointed, with a great location just steps from the University. A couple negatives… the immediate neighbor’s house is a bit of a dump with multiple boats and cars cluttering the yard. The rental house itself is very comfortable and has been thoughtfully updated, but there are creaking floorboards that make it tough if one bedroom wakes up before another. The walls are also somewhat thin between this place and the adjoining apartment. The neighbors were reasonably quiet and respectful, but I could practically eavesdrop on their conversation as I was drifting off to sleep. All that said, I’m still giving a 5 star review because the place is as advertised with a great location and good value for the money."

It was easy to get to and the restaurants that I grabbed carry out from were all about five mins away. With the restaurants, and two grocery stores, I don’t think I ever needed to go anywhere that was more than seven minutes from the house.
The provided water was also the best water I’ve had in years. And I have a great filter on my faucet at home.
The shower products are really great and the shampoo was some of the best I’ve used in a very long time as well.
The hosts were friendly and responsive.

Stayed a few nights","Was only planning to stay one night, but doubled down on a second night because it was such a comfortable oasis to recharge while on a cross-country roadtrip. The city had just gotten nuked with snow and ice, and they had the driveway and entrance cleared and salted for me to arrive with no worries after a long day driving.
Every kind of store and restaurant and service is within a short drive of 5-10 minutes, including downtown.
The simple but stylish setup was incredibly comfortable, cozy, and spacious, with every single need already anticipated with amenities and clear instructions both online and in a binder on the desk.
11 out of 10 would stay again!"

Seems we are always heading out for the evening and leaving early in the morning so we don't get get to enjoy all the amenities, but its one of the best equipped places we stay. And the best bang for your buck!"

Cat has thought of everything from sound machine to charging adaptors, black out curtains, to-go coffee cups, bottled water. The room is beautifully appointed with everything you could possibly need. Very comfortable bed and large screen TV made us feel right at home. The neighborhood is extremely nice and felt safe. We enjoyed a Cuban dinner right around the corner. We just couldn't not have asked for anything better."

Thanks for the stash of plastic take away containers, Kleenex, toilet paper and paper towels and coffee!
The pull out mattress wasn't even from head to toe and so the guest sleeping there (who didn't want all the blood to rush to his head), ended up taking the mattress out and using it on the floor. Perhaps a Murphy bed could be a good alternative for that space?
Great neighborhood. Great town. Thank you!"

Everything was clean, the bed and linens were comfy and the kitchen was very well stocked. Check the freezer before you buy your own coffee, there is quite a selection there from previous guests, including us :)
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay; walking to the Co-op, restaurants, coffee houses, the park and the beautiful neighborhood daily. We made some friends just by enjoying the sun on the porch swing. Everyone was so friendly and there's plenty of foot traffic to chit-chat with. The cottage is only a couple of blocks from Hyde Park, and despite the foot-traffic to downtown the area is very quiet, even in the evenings.
Thank you Phil and Dana for the most perfect stay in your beautiful town!"

Super cozy, the place is as advertised... never takes long to get downtown to hang out, either! Don't want this too busy as we'd love to stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","This is a very cute, well-decorated property in a dream location. The bed was comfortable and the cotton sheets were very soft with a lovely scent. The kitchen is well-designed and fully stocked with all the necessities we needed for cooking, etc. The only real negative is the tiny bathroom. The lack of space, dim lighting, not quite clean floor, and sliding door that re-opens if not latched, combined to make bathroom activities a bit tiresome during our 5-night stay. The location is superb; a short walk to the Hyde Park restaurants and Camels Back park."

Everything we needed was walkable including the Co-op and Camel’s Back. It was roomy and classy enough to have people over who also complimented the space. What a great find in my own home state! We were also able to cook a small Thanksgiving meal in the space with plenty of tools and pans available. Oh and the Viking oven was a nice feature as well.

The bed was incredibly comfortable and the home had everything we needed. As someone who can’t sleep without a sound machine or a fan, I was so grateful that both were present already!

The hosts were responsive about possibly get someone out to look at it, luckily after 8am the water pressure came back up (likely after sprinkler system shut off). Unfortunately this made us miss our breakfast we had planned with others we were in town with and a frantic start to the morning. I inquired about a refund or partial due to the inconvenience but have not received a response a day later. Unfortunate"

Let me just say the included bikes are a huge perk. We biked everywhere, from Downtown to Outlaw Field for a concert to a hike just outside the city. The greenway is incredibly convenient as well for getting around. I wouldn't do Boise without a bike and having them included was great!
The home was just as described, very comfortable, clean and had all the necessities. We worked from the house for a couple days during the week before exploring on the weekend. The internet speeds were as advertised and we never had an issue.
If you're thinking about visiting Boise either for work or fun... stay here! You couldn't find a better home base."

There were a lot of small details that went into it such as coffee creamer packets in the fridge as well as mugs in the freezer. The towels smelled extra clean and the bed and pillows were really soft (though the bed is memory foam so it does get a tad warm). Really great place to stay! And great that it’s actually a reasonable cleaning fee and doesn’t have a list of chores to do when checking out.

The house is small but didn’t feel cramped with 2 occupants. Lots of storage space. Decor felt fresh and updated yet cozy and fit the character of the home and neighborhood. Although we didn’t cook in the kitchen this trip it would be great for preparing meals- lots of counter space and room to move. Bathroom is very tiny! Neighborhood is surprisingly quiet considering the close proximity to 13th Street with lots of patrons parking near the house. Would book again and recommend to friends and family.

Charming home, perfect for two, fully equipped. My favorite was lying in the bed facing the fireplace, as it snowed outside ❄️"

Stayed a few nights",The Hyde Park house is a cool studio type one bedroom that is the best location for all the village shops. This place is so well laid out that it’s definitely more small house than a studio. Every amenity provided for! Cooks kitchen. Absolutely awesome decor & furnishings! Toasty gas fireplace. Very comfortable bedroom plus a pull out couch in living room. Great for two people maybe more. This place reminded us of Scotland stays. Well designed on everything. Bathroom tight quarters for those with mobility challenge but for us it worked. Super enjoyed this Hyde Park house with great hosts. Appreciated walking into a heated warm house on a cold chilly night!

Stayed a few nights","Enjoyed my stay! My only complaints, and they are minor, are about accuracy of the listing. Once I arrived in this cute neighborhood with its great location relative to downtown, I expected to have parking. The listing stated both ‘on premises parking’, and also referred to ‘on street parking’. There was no parking for me other than searching for a spot on the street. I brought this to their attention, and they did not have much to say to excuse it away. I found various spots on the street during my stay, none more than a block or so away, but usually on the same street. Ok. The second item, was they had a toaster listed under the amenities. When asked, they quickly replied back, and said there was none. They did drop one by in time for the next morning, which was appreciated. So that is it! I value accuracy, and knowing I can count on what I’m told is there, what is included, and not included. One star less for (in)accuracy. I’d suggest they correct those parts of the listing that aren’t so. It was a fine stay otherwise, well appointed kitchen, little things like seasonings and olive oil for cooking, toiletries there if I needed, laundry pods and the like. Suited me and my needs great for my stay. Thank you!"

Stayed about a week","The place was amazing, unfortunately our timing didn’t work out. The city of Boise was doing some underground construction right outside the house for the whole week we were there. They even decided to work one night. Needless to say, it wasn’t quiet at all. The hosts were very understanding and even refunded us some money. Not their fault other than the fact that they could have given us a heads up on the construction, it started in May and was going to go through June. As long as there is no construction, this would be a great place to stay."

Stayed with a pet","My sister and 3 adult sons spent 5 nights and we were blown away by Kirstin, the house/Patio and being a block from the Greenbelt! You could explore the Greenbelt for a month straight and still not see everything. We took our dog to 'Dog Island' at Ann Williams Park and saw so much wild life (Turtles, frogs, raptors, ducks) We went biking at sunrise, kayaking and fishing at sunset. It is very easy to get kayaks to the pond across the bridge. Fantastic restaurants on the river just a couple of blocks away.
The house!! It was outstanding in every way. It exudes a cozy, modern vibe with many gathering spaces that can pull any group together for meaningful moments. We cooked a lot in the kitchen (has everything) and BBQ'd every night. The lights on the patio were stunning. The beds! Best nights sleep ever. There are so many other things I could say! We are all still talking about what an amazing time we had. This will be always be our first choice for Boise"

Stayed with a pet","We had a great stay at Kristen's place....I had stayed in this area (actually right around the corner) about 4 years ago and had loved it. Now coming back this time, all the restuarants were fully open, the green belt is literally a few steps from the back yard. We loved sitting outside and just people watching in the evening. It was a little on the colder side while we were there so we didn't get to enjoy the kayaks in the garage BUT....if it had been warmer you are just steps away from a chain of lakes to enjoy them on. Lots of green space and places to go on foot.
The place was so comfortable too. We had 4 people there and plenty of space. The kitchen was about one of the most stocked places I've been to. Lots of spices, essentials for cooking and all the pots and pans you could ask for. It really felt like home. I would definitely come back and stay again."

Stayed a few nights","This is a wonderful property. Very close to the river, restaurants, parks, trails, etc. The courtyard area is a wonderful place to hang out and/or entertain. Unfortunately, there were a few things about the property that weren't quite ready for guests. Kirsten was available and took care of those things within her power. I am quite sure the remaining items will be resolved in short order. We would definitely stay here next time we're in Boise."

Stayed a few nights","It is my favorite place to stay in the Boise area. In a quiet neighborhood, very close to the Boise river and the Greenbelt, it has everything you could ask for. Each room is carefully decorated and the outside patio is perfect for relaxing. The bikes in the garage allowed us to explore the Greenbelt, and next time, I hope to float the river in the two kayaks also available.
The hosts have created a wonderful space from which to venture out into a beautiful part of the Boise river system. I highly recommend this Airbnb. We slept well, ate well and enjoyed our time here. It’s exceptional."

Stayed a few nights",This was hands down one of the best airbnbs I’ve ever stayed in. It is 1 block from the green belt and Luciano’s restaurant which is a huge bonus. The house is in perfect condition and we felt at home. The fireplace in the living room is perfect for those cold Boise days. Another bonus is the house next door is also ram by Kristen and our friends stayed there — which made for a wonderful weekend for our 4 kids to play and the adults to hang out. If you are coming to Boise — stay here. You’ll love it — and be sure to rent a line scooter while you are here.

The greenbelt trail is lovely and the local coffee shop (5 min walk) was awesome! The beds were comfy and we loved spending time chatting by the fireplace. Kirsten is a responsive and accommodating host.

Stayed a few nights","We like to go out and explore during the day but have a comfortable place to lounge in the evening. This house was perfect for that! It is only a block from the Greenbelt, which takes you all the way to downtown through trees, parks, and some commercial/restaurant areas. There were also a surprising number of fun eating and drinking spots within a 15 minute walk.
The house itself was exactly as pictured. There were a couple of comfortable seating areas inside, as well as a fabulous patio with fireplace in the front of the house. The master bedroom had a super comfy memory foam mattress and pillows for a good night's sleep after a long hike or walking all over town. We also really enjoyed the double sinks and spacious bathrooms.
We were bummed that the provided bikes had multiple flat tires, which forced us to change some of our plans. Kirsten was responsive and did her best to resolve the issues quickly, but there's only so much she could do since she doesn't have a stash of extra bikes like a rental shop would. The bikes are a nice benefit, but maybe just don't count on them if you're like us and don't have the know-how to do basic repairs if needed."

My wife and I would absolutely recommend this wonderful home to anyone visiting Boise. The Owner, Kirsten communicates extremely well. The home is warm, well kept, and very comfortable. I cannot say enough about the location, and I highly recommend using the bikes provided by the Owner to take a stroll down the green belt…absolutely the highlight of our weekend. 5 stars each for (1) Owner, (2) Cleanliness, (3) location, (4) Amenities, and (5) Comfort. If it’s available…book it, you will thank me (and Kirsten) later.👍"

And the convenience to the river green belt could not have been any better. I couldn’t believe that Italian restaurant on the green belt was so close —and the outdoor wine bar.
Communication with Kirsten during the check in and out process was so easy and I really appreciated the use of the garage. She thought of everything—from the bikes and kayaks in the garage to the coffee, creamer, and sweetener to start of my morning. She is deserving of that super-host designation! Definitely would stay here again."

The attached garage is very convenient. There are 2 bikes with helmets, which are awesome for riding on the river trail & to downtown. We easily put the 2 kayaks on the trolley, pulled them to the other side of the river and paddled in the lakes. Each night, we sat out on the patio to relax. Luciano's, right next to the river, was excellent. Push & Pour Coffee Shop is within walking distance; yummy coffee and pastries. Kirsten made sure we were able to self-check-in ok, which I thought was a nice. She is a quick communicator! We didn't bring our dog but the little welcome set-up and the doggie doors were nice additions. The patio area is 100% fenced."

Stayed about a week","This is a cute and cozy townhouse a block from the Boise River. We're local (had to get out of the house during renovations), so we knew where it was, but we didn't realize how much fun it was going to be! Kirsten provides bikes and kayaks, so you can just hop on the Greenbelt or into the Whitewater Park. A good-sized front yard and patio with a firepit, table and chairs, and a gas grill make it a relaxing vacation spot. The kitchen is well equipped; the 2 bedrooms and bathrooms upstairs are large and comfortable. Be aware that, as of this writing, there is a lot of construction on the block, so street parking is affected. Regardless, we highly recommend this house - we'd stay again if the need arose!"

The home is roomy and comfortable, the kitchen well stocked, plenty of pristine linens, and generously supplied with other details that travelers appreciate. It's just a 3 minute stroll through the cute neighborhood to the river walk, past charming places to eat, drink wine, etc. We were pleasantly surprised to find a pet kit with items to make our dogs stay great too. I would happily pass up a stay at our typical hotel chain to stay here again...much more quiet and roomy, but as hospitable as our ""platinum"" status. Kirsten will definitely make you feel welcomed and at home. She is paying attention to details that make an Airbnb stay worth it."

Beautiful location very near the Green River, complete with bicycles and kayaks available for use. Our small dogs were happy being able to walk around l in the fenced in yard; we enjoyed sitting on the patio. We were very close to a fun restaurant, Luciano's, which had very good food. The bartender wanted to come out and pet our dogs!
The information booklet of our hosts was extremely helpful. Our hosts also very thoughtfully left us a bottle of wine! This was after two nights of no dinner, so we were delighted to see the wine! Also, the bedding was extremely beautiful amd comfortable which makes a big difference when you have been on the road for several long days! We could not have had a better stay.

Most people skimp on this part but not here. The upstairs movie room was great at night for all of us to hang out in and watch TV. They had extra blankets and pillows so it made it super relaxing. I loved that the bathrooms were already stocked with shampoo/conditioner/body wash so didn't have to worry about bringing those with us. The towels were nice and soft. The house being pet friendly was a huge perk. My Son was able to bring over their small dog for the day while we were cooking etc and would go in and out of the doggy door. She even played with the super sweet doggy next door. If you are looking for a nice quiet relaxing home this is it. Very nice!"

Stayed with kids","We stayed one night at Samantha's Place while in town for a wedding and her house accommodated our family wonderfully. Plenty of space in the living room for playing games together. Both bathrooms were spacious, and the fresh eggs in the fridge was a nice bonus and made for a great late-night snack! Samantha was friendly and accommodated our change of time for check-in. It's near the freeway and convenient to downtown Boise. One minor thing--bring your own shampoo and soap. We don't stay in Air BnBs often and we didn't think of bringing our own--thought they'd be provided like a hotel. No big deal at all though--I'm sure if I contacted Samantha about it when we were there she might have had some toiletries on hand for us to use. Her house in really peaceful and on a beautiful small country farm lot."

The guest house is separated by the garage, so you're entirely private. Lots of room to spread out if you have a family and looks exactly like the pictures. she had all the amenities you could need, including a pack n play, laundry etc. I'd highlyrecommend staying here.

We needed a place to stay where our friend and her large dog could also stay a few days after her house was packed up. Samatha's home provided just what we needed. The split bathroom/bedroom setup allowed my husband and I to use one bedroom/bath and our friend to use the other - almost like she had a separate suite. Sam's dogs were very good with our friend's large Bernese Mountain Dog and her big fenced yard gave them plenty of room to romp. Everything was clean and neat when we arrived and there was plenty of parking. We really couldn't have asked for a better setup!

Stayed with a pet","My family loved our stay at Samantha’s guest house. We are used to self check-in, but it was a nice change to be greeted by Samantha with a warm welcome, even when we arrived late. Her home was very spacious and clean with a fun eclectic style. We loved her backyard and roaming chickens. Our 19 year dachshund was allowed to stay. We would love to come back on a longer trip and would highly recommend staying at this Airbnb. Thank you!"

Stayed with a pet","Samantha’s guest house was the perfect location for our Boise adventure. It is located near city center, without being in the hustle, and also near to the surrounding wilderness areas we had planned to visit. Conveniently located to grocery stores, restaurants and the freeways.
The guest house is also situated on a wonderful piece of property where we could let our pup roam freely or play with her dogs. We enjoyed the mini farm atmosphere of chickens and cows, with the occasional hawk fly by. The fresh eggs from the chickens spoiled us immediately to store bought.
Samantha is an amazing host who is friendly, fun to have conversation with and has great recommendations.
We are already missing our home away from home and look forward to our next visit."

Kitchen equipped for actual meal preparation. She’s got a car ac adapter pump for paddle boards and even a board to lend as needed! My dog loved the giant yard (and sprinklers) and had a ball playing with the lab and smaller dog. Peaceful and quiet — but no more than 15-25 min away from anywhere you’d want to go. Was just perfect!

It’s truly a hidden gem…conveniently located within a few miles of the airport, city center, and all the hustle and bustle of the city…yet you find yourself in a super quiet, rural neighborhood of farmland and sprawling acreage. Sam’s guest house is completely remodeled, filled with all modern conveniences and technologies, striking artwork and furnishings, and super comfortable bedding. There are free range chickens on the property (with farm fresh eggs provided for breakfast!), and adorable goats next door. Sam’s 2 dogs are super friendly and greeted my small shih-tzu with slobbery kisses and wagging tails. I’ll definitely return to this lovely property whenever I’m in Boise."

Stayed with kids","My family and I had great time staying at this location. It was nice being right next door to the Franklin House, they have a beer garden directly next door! We didn’t realize upon booking that this house had three levels that were rented out. We were under the impression that we booked a single level home, but that was on us for not reading the description closely enough. Although we weren’t expecting others sharing the space with us we were able to make friends with the full time attendant below and fellow Airbnb renters above. The location and our portion of the house were perfect for what we needed. If this house was a single level home with no neighbors it would have been a 10/10 but all things considered the house was still everything we needed and more. We were just a little more weary of any noise we would make, having two kids, which made the overall experience a little more stressful than we were expecting. We apologized for any excessive noise but our neighbors didn’t notice"

Stayed a few nights","Airbnb isn’t what it used to be. I say this because it used to be room side cash, and now it’s a full lodging service, so a check-out chores list that includes sheet laundry and dishes just isn’t as reasonable as it once was.
HOWEVER outside of that, excellent place. Quiet wooded neighborhood right next to a market, walking distance to downtown. I slept like an absolute stone too, really comfy bedding."

I felt so safe in their neighborhood and loved the fresh farm eggs and banana bread they provided. What a special touch. I would’ve love to stay here for a month it was so lovely and hope to be back.

Stayed a few nights","Kurt and Heather were terrific hosts. They sent us detailed instructions ahead of time, and let us know when everything was ready before we checked in on the day of arrival. They were happy to answer any questions too.
The setting is rural, has a nice farm-feeling, and was peaceful. Our hosts made this unit very welcoming and comfortable. It's a place you can just kick back and relax. Everything was clean and tidy with plenty of natural light. Some of the lights are a bit bright for us, but some softer bulbs or dimmer switches might be a nice adjustment. The bathroom is a generous size, with the walk-in closet. We enjoyed the fresh eggs from their chickens and baked banana bread and butter in the fridge....a very nice personal touch. We would definitely recommend staying at Kurt & Heather's and would visit again if we are in the area."

Stayed a few nights","This was the perfect stay for our trip & exceeded all our needs, both in lodging & communications w/ the hosts. The property is exactly as described, and there's additional information listed in the unit upon check-in.
The kitchen is perfect, really functional, and met all our needs. There is no oven/stove, but a hot plate is provided, and there are plenty of extras, most notably the fresh eggs & baked banana bread😉. So good! Thank you!
The bed has multiple pillows, some of which are softer, and others are more firm, which was great because it met both of our needs for comfort, and there are plenty of extra blankets, towels, and storage space.
The one, and only issue we had is the main street is a bit dark, so sometimes you have to really look out for the driveway, but GPS really solves that issue. Otherwise, the neighborhood is nice & quiet, the stay was perfect & we would absolutely come back!
ps. The chickens are very cute"

As a first time Air B and B-er we did not know what to expect and mostly spent our time in Boise eating out and on the go. Their house is a great landing pad, safe location and very close to the zoo and many dining options."

This place is very spacious so you get some space in living room with kitchen that came with fresh eggs and delicious banana bread (which I need to ask for recipe because it was so good) and then goes into bedroom with spacious bathroom. They had everything I needed from all kitchen wears (wine openers too!) to shampoo, conditioner, you name it. Host is extremely accommodating and understanding. Couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay. Thank you!"

There was delicious banana bread and we were offered to help ourselves to fresh eggs from their chickens. Kurt spent a reasonable amount of time talking to my husband and I. We had our almost 2 year old with us and he enjoyed playing on the swing set and their sweet dog. 100% recommend staying here.

The only thing I would call out is that the listing says she lives with her husband and daughter, but her daughter is a small toddler so just a note that there could be some crying noise at times. Other than that, everything went smoothly and I appreciate Bridget letting me stay a little longer to finish some calls."

Stayed over a week","When we identified this property on Airbnb, it seemed to match our needs in terms of location, size, cost, etc. But if anything, we found the property to be even better than it looked on Airbnb!
The space is over a three-car garage (but we never heard garage doors, cars etc.), with an outside staircase (careful - steep!) for private entry. The place is cozy yet spacious, a comfortable one-bedroom apartment with excellent king sized bed. Two TVs. Nice bath, with a 2nd toilet available in the cozy laundry/closet room (small washer/dryer for clothes).
The combined kitchen / dining / living room had a very spacious feel. Dishes, pots and pans were nice and met our needs. It is a perfect place for two - but easily could house a few more (like a family with a few small children).
We didn't have much contact with the hosts, but when we did (in person or texting) they were friendly and immediately responsive. When we return to Boise, we very much hope to be able to stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","This was a great place to stay. Clean & exactly as described with thoughtful touches. The location is convenient, minutes away from the village. The kitchen was well stocked for anyone needing to cook. Fragrant lilac trees on the way in were a welcomed surprise! I’d happily stay here again, but will note the following for help to both the host and guest:
The apartment is located on top of a garage and connects to the main house. The door that connects to the main house lets through noise from the kitchen area down there, so I was able to hear kids crying, playing, and pots and pans banging around over the weekend. Garage door as well. This didn’t really bother me, but I think it could bother someone, so worth noting.
I made a pizza in the toaster oven one evening. While nothing was burning, the smoke alarm in the main house was set off. There was nothing I could do about it as I couldn’t access the main house, but it’s worth considering some additional ventilation for the future."

She answered our questions of where an item might be located and she answered questions for us and is kind and wanted to make us aware that she was always available if we neeeed anything. The guest house was clean, free of clutter, comfortable, private, quiet, and peaceful. We loved the booklet of recommendations for outings, restaurants, life in Boise, other useful information for guests. Samantha had Idaho sugar cookies at the guest house that we brought cookies home to our daughter. Love to stay at this guest house again!

Samantha had very clear and awesome instructions while also being very friendly and kind. I really liked the little details she added from around the area so we could get a taste of Boise. We walk around but it seemed like there was a bunch to do close by if you’re able to stay for more than one night. My favorite part of this house though was the whole bathroom. I liked the layout a lot and absolutely loved the shower!! It was just really relaxing and really what me and my friend needed to recuperate for more driving the next day.

Stayed with kids","What a fantastic place in Boise! Super quick car access to downtown, or to the surrounding hills for hikes. Just a few blocks walking distance to park with playground, which our toddler loved. Inside the apartment was incredibly lovely, with great decorative touches and Idaho themes. Cookies awaiting us, which we enjoyed on the lovely patio (which comes with fence, again huge plus with toddler!). Bathroom absolutely to die for - huge space, awesome shower, and a tub as well! Kitchen well stocked, bed super comfy. Felt like home! A super lovely space, we hardly wanted to leave. Will stay again when we come back to Boise!"

There are extras of every item and stocked cupboards full of things you might forget on a trip! The small “Idaho” details were so cute. She offered complimentary sparkling cider for us to celebrate a birthday. She was so responsive and kind. 10/10 would stay there a bunch of times!!"

The bathroom alone is reason enough to return. A shared shower space with a large clawfoot tub was really all my wife needed and this space checked all of her boxes. We would recommemd this place to anyone looking to tuck away from the world for a couple days."
