Stayed a few nights","As advertised, very comfortable and spacious house. Easy to feel at home. Really cool fire pit out back and the game room if ripe with opportunity for good times. But the mattresses omg the mattresses, SO comfortable. Slept like a rock. Friendly communication, comfortable and spacious abode, good sleep. And it’s in a nice and quiet neighborhood, didn’t work about anything being stolen out of the work truck which was relaxing. Great experience, thanks for letting us stay."

Stayed a few nights","Very clean and spacious! All the furniture was very comfortable. Everything was organized well.
Note, the shower in the main bathroom is a little hard to get in to, the sides are tall and the door only half opens. A step there would help. Also, I could have used a side table in the main bedroom, I have a CPAP and there was nothing to put it on? I used a kitchen chair, but maybe a table there would be nice. We didn't use the backyard but it looked nice.
But those were MINOR things, specific to us. The house is worth the price and we enjoyed our stay! It was a comfortable place for Christmas with our airman stationed at Cannon."

Ali had water and snacks for us on the kitchen table. This made it feel like we were visiting friends. The home felt very cozy and welcoming. The home office is amazing if you need to conduct business. The Wi-fi is fast and reliable. The backyard is inviting with a nice shade tree. The neighborhood was peaceful and quiet. Ali also let us know he was a text message away if we needed anything.

The house has all amenities you could need while away from home, has a warm welcoming feeling as you walk in and is located in very nice neighborhood. The next time I'm in Clovis no doubt ill be staying here again."

Stayed with a pet","When I arrived the lock on the door wasn’t working, the batteries were dead. After check out had to deal with her about dog hair. Wanting to charge an extra 50 because of supposed excess dog hair. Iam assuming she doesn’t like to wash sheets when guest leave. You have to wash them anyways, I wouldn’t recommend staying with “Karen”. Always better when the homeowner has a 3rd party service run the property. People have sentimental emotions tied to a home and tend to be overly protective of the house. Complaining about the smallest things."

She was so communicative, left a welcome note and treats for our dogs, and went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable. I believe the home is also brand new, with nice finishes and furniture. The location was great – close to both the highway and downtown Clovis, and we loved having a nice backyard with both rocks and grass to take our pups out. The use of the one car garage was much appreciated too! Would definitely recommend, and hope to return!"

Stayed with kids","This place is a gem! Naomi was friendly and responsive.This home was walking distance to a grocery store or a few minutes drive to restaurants and shops. The place itself was SPOTLESS which is a must for us. I felt more comfortable in this home than a hotel. The beds were comfy, there was plenty of parking and the surrounding area of the neighborhood was quiet. This place was a 10/10 for our family of 6."

Stayed a few nights","Although the street address is 1423 Hickory Street, the entrance that guests use is around the block on Fairmont Ct. I had to call Naomi to get this information, as the door facing Hickory St. is not the proper one for Airbnb guests. This should be noted in the property description.
The house was generally very clean, the utensil holder in the kitchen draw was rather dirty, as was the dish drying rack. Since there is no dishwasher, the absence of a clean drying rack was a problem."

This was my first time using Airbnb services and I’m extremely pleased I tought I consider my self a hotel person but I changed my mind. I’m would love to always use her house when will come to our son football games at ENMU."

Stayed a few nights","This place was really nice and clean.
Some things that would be helpful are more towels, hand towels, and washcloths. There was only one of each for a whole week. Hand towels in the kitchen would save on paper towels.
The kitchen was well stocked; however, the frying pan was all scratched up and the food stuck horribly. Maybe the place needs plastic cooking utensils so people won't scratch up the pan.
Overall, I really liked the place. It was super clean and organized. She even wrote me a sweet note on a large chalkboard."

Stayed one night","The House was awesome and was exactly as described.
However, we were charged a pet fee of $85.00. The listing said pets were welcome but never asked if we actually had any. Im assuming that they have cameras and are watching. And then after the cleaning crew came they stated that they had to remove some dog waste in the yard ( we always clean after our pet ) and then demanded another $50. Which we paid. The place is really nice and convenient but Dont bring a pet."

Stayed with kids","Our stay was great. There was enough space for my family. We were in Clovis attending a funeral. The space was clean and spacious. There are stairs for this unit (just one small flight) . My son was on crutches and I have a bad knee so that was the only thing that was difficult. However I missed that in the info. It was included in the description. The inside of unit is clean and cute. The outside of unit needs a little TLC on the stairs. But we weren’t sleeping outside so that didn’t matter. I plan to come back to Clovis to visit family again and would gladly stay here again. The water pressure is amazing and the temp. I noticed there was a playpen and air mattresses available for use as well. The host also had additional toiletries for guests. My daughter had a virtual interview that next morning and there was a really nice desk space available. Charging ports in all the lamps. Clean refrigerator , washer and dryer, working digital AC and restaurants very close by!!"

Stayed a few nights","For my business trips i work in small towns, and for the small towns they don’t have modern places to stay. This place was deff the nicest place i really liked it. I also liked the bathroom as well. A lot of toilet paper was provided, soaps and everything. There was also a security system in the place to. What was cool was he also had air mattresses inside as well that you can take advantage. It was very cozy inside and i can tell he dumped a lot of money into the property it was pretty nice. There was a review on here about the hot water and i can deff tell he fixed it because i like my showers warm. Deff recommend the place and it was at the right price. If i go back there that is my go to air bnb."

Very safe part of Clovis right by the golf course and lots of eating right by the main road. The apartment was remodeled, clean, internet, TV and directions. The aesthetic was welcoming and nicely put together. The beds were extremely comfortable IN BOTH BEDROOMS. Sometimes people cheap out on the guest rooms, but this property owned by Cavu didn’t miss a beat! Easy to find and responsive owner, Lou was great to work with."

Group trip","The owner indicated that they had a 6 people condo and falsely advertised a queen size bed in the living room, but instead had in inflatable mattress that keep deflating every 30 minutes. There was no mention of the mattress in the add. When asked for a partial refund they refused to even offer us anything. Also, there was no bedding present at the time we got there and we had to call and get it from a different facility. Just giving you a warning if you wanted to stay. I did not appreciate not only for inaccurate description of the property, but also no willingness from the owners to work with us. I will never stay with them again or recommend that to anyone."

It's incredibly quiet at night for great sleep, and the business district is within walking distance, as is a pretty park or golf course. The neighborhood feels safe.
The unit has great heating and AC, is easy to access through a keyless entry box, and Lou was fully available when I had questions.
It's clear that they care a lot about making a nice place for people to stay. I definitely recommend this spot to others staying in Clovis, and will check with them first when traveling through again."

We travel through here a couple of times a year and will always book here if available. Extremely clean, well appointed and comfy. Beautiful backyard with lots of seating. Very quiet neighborhood that’s convenient to multiple restaurants. It feels like staying with friends."

I'm guessing this is why there's almost no furniture in the living room area. But this is not deal breaker at all just an observation on how obviously new the place is. Instructions were clear and very helpful for my guys to follow. More than spacious parking spots (it fit their trucks!) Very fair price. Will book this place again.

Marie graciously accommodated our request for a late check out so that we could go birding at dawn then return to the house with time to rest and shower before starting the long drive home.
Hope to have another chance to stay with Marie when in Clovis."

Large wood dining table that anyone would be proud to have in their home made dining easy and fun for the family. For taller people the main shower is great. Yard is well arranged and perfect for a small gathering with great seating. It even has an authentic Chimnea to ward off the nighttime chill while seated outside. The Jacuzzi was a plus and well maintained. Next time I stay in Clovis this will be my go to place.

Stayed with kids","This house was perfect for our family reunion with our son at Cannon AFB. Plenty of room(s) for us, our children and grandchildren, including an infant, AND two dogs. The patio, hot tub, picnic area and fenced in backyard made for some great outdoor memories and the dogs loved being able to roam in and out at will. Very nicely decorated. Dana and Deb were very immediately responsive to all of our needs. House has everything you will need, is in a quiet neighborhood and close to most everything."

Stayed with kids","We stayed at this home while visiting family in Clovis. It was beautifully decorated in the traditional New Mexican style and had great amenities including an awesome hot tub, great yard for our dog and toddler and some provided snacks. Clovis isn't very big but the location was convenient to stores and restaurants. Would definitely stay here again when we visit in the future."

Stayed a few nights","We loved our stay here. We felt like we were walking into our own home. Such great little touches (snacks, bathrobes, etc). The place is decorated perfect for the style of house. The backyard is a great space and perfect for us traveling with a dog. I'd love to come back when it's warmer and enjoy the patio. The host herself was very quick to respond to questions and friendly. We hope to be back on our next trip!"

Stayed a few nights","La Paz has many southwestern accoutrements added to its interior. There is a hot tub and ample sleeping quarters. However, the prices of cleaning and “service fee” is twice to three times of any other AirBNB offering in the region."

Stayed a few nights",This is a beautiful home and Dana had provided all the information we needed plus stocked the house with snacks! We loved staying here - it felt like an amazing home away from home and one of the few places in Clovis we could find that allowed pets. Wish we could've stayed longer!

Stayed a few nights",This house is absolutely outstanding. Its super clean. The decoration is beautiful. Beds are super comfortable including all bedding and linens. Without a doubt one of the best places i have stayed at. The extras are amazing. Dana thought about everything you could possibly miss or forget and it was there at no extra cost. The snacks that were there for us were great since we were there for work and getting back very tired. The back yard is great and comfortable. Could not ask for more. Will definitely be staying there again.

Stayed about a week","We stayed here just prior to Labor Day weekend and found the property very well appointed, supplied and comfortable with a relaxing southwestern mission feel. Dana, the manager, was very responsive with replacing a slow drip coffee pot and we had no other problems. The beds were comfortable and kitchen and living spaces were great for our stay. Thoughtful touches like a welcome snack basket and even a big bowl of garden fresh veggies and peppers made us feel so welcome. We used the charcoal grill (charcoal,etc provided) several times to smoke ribs, grill burgers, chicken and pork loins adding to the useful and at home feel. The backyard space was used a lot in the evening and the AC kept the house comfy day and night during a pretty hot week. The hard wood floors were lovely but a bit creaky which didn’t bother us as we sleep with “waves” in the background. There was ample parking out front and it is on a fairly busy residential street so we were not in the front much having spent our outdoors time enjoying the backyard space. Street noise was not an issue for us. All in all a very pleasant experience and an awesome stay. Would definitely stay again!"

Stayed with kids","Great house with a great backyard. Fully stocked pans and utensils, grill outside, fire pit, patio furniture... we spent a lot of time out back grilling and hanging out as a family. The kids liked playing with the water hose :-) Our host was great at communication and made our stay wonderful. TVs in every room with plenty to watch. Nice neighborhood too, safe to walk with the kids and friendly neighbors. Highly recommend."
