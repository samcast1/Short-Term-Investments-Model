Stayed about a week","This listing is great! And the host is even better. The door was sticking and I couldn’t get in and thought I was locked out…at 1 in the morning. This man drove out there, opened the door, and even smiled and said it was no big deal. The place is fantastic. Private. Quiet. It’s a bit confusing to get to at first because the parking is down an alley behind the property but there’s a reserved spot for this listing. I will definitely be staying again!!"

Stayed over a week","Shane's place was great and I highly recommend it from people who need an AirBnB to stay in while in Dubois. He was quick to respond when I had questions. The location is great, very close to convenience stores, restaurants, downtown Dubois, and grocery stores in the area. It is very close to the Dubois hospital so is great for people who may be working there short-term. The place was spotless when I arrived, and the amenities Shane provided were above and beyond what I have encountered with AirBnBs in the past. Overall, I would recommend this AirBnB to anyone staying in the area."

Stayed with kids","Nice neighborhood.
House as described.
Overall comfortable.
Centrally located near downtown .
Wasn’t easy to find the gravel road in the back of the house.
You have to make a right in the stop before you get the house, to find the gravel road and park.
One downside was The curtains are a bit long and cover the AC unit in the bedroom windows. And theAC unit is too close to your head .
The house is neat and the decorations are nice.
Plenty of bathroom towels !
Convenient parking.
Washer and dryer (pay) available.
Brittany out coffee, tea k-cups , a few water bottles in the fridge and snacks . Thanks Brittany!
Overall comfortable stay!"

Everything clean, no smells, etc. Definitely not soundproof - I could hear the person in the apartment above speaking very clearly on the phone. The beds are a stiffer foam mattress that I was wondering about, but we all slept great!! Would recommend."

Stayed with a pet","Great stay for relaxing family lake vacation. Played golf twice with the whole family (fore!). Karaoke, yoga, live music by the lake. Bbq'd a few nights on the webber charcoal grill. All in all a very chill vacation. The property was only a 3 minute walk to the biggest of the 3 beaches on treasure lake. We spent a lot of time using the 2 provided kayaks while here... even caught some live music happening at a house by the water one night from our kayaks.
Added bonus, we must have seen 100 deer around the lake during our stay.
Paul was informative and responsive as our host.
thank you!"

Stayed with a pet","My week-long stay at this Airbnb nestled in Dubois, Pennsylvania was nothing short of enchanting. From the moment I arrived, I was greeted by the serene ambiance of the wooded suburban setting directly across from the lake.
One of the highlights of my stay was waking up to the sight of deer gracefully roaming the area each morning. It felt like a magical encounter with nature right at the doorstep. And if that wasn't enough, I was treated to the delightful sight of a red fox frolicking across the road, adding an extra layer of charm to the already picturesque surroundings.
The house is well kept and I felt safe and had good nights rest.
I highly recomend. Thanks Paul for hosting."

We explored the area, including a picnic lunch and hike around Bilger’s Rocks and then dinner at Scottish Heights one day; and lunch at Angry Goat, dinosaurs, mini golf and ice cream at Dr. Doolittle’s another. It was also nice to walk to the playground and beach. Highly recommend staying here for a nice weekend getaway."

Stayed one night","Michael's communication was wonderful. He was also kind with flexibility.
We stayed with my Mother (who has Dementia) but were unsure until the last minute whether we needed an overnight option.
Even after letting Michael know that we wouldn't need to stay at his place, he offered to still have it ready for us in case things changed.
I understandall the positive reviews, and should we need a place in the future, we will check here first."

Stayed with a pet","I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this place; it was quite pleasant. However, I encountered a surprise when I noticed an escalator in the bedroom, not mentioned in the photos. This raised some concern for me, even though there's a print on the walls indicating that the stairs don't lead anywhere. Michael's place is indeed cozy, and as a thoughtful host, he ensures all necessary amenities are available, such as the kind gesture of providing water and snacks. Unfortunately, the noise level affected my sleep, and there were two instances of an alarm ringing in the outside area, which was not ideal. Although there isn't a smart TV, the check-out time Michael set was perfect, and he remained responsive throughout."

There was a bit of a musty smell which makes sense in an old house, but I’m super sensitive about smells. I could tell that Michael kept it clean though and even had an air purifier running which I appreciated. The bed was comfortable and there were clean dishes and towels for our use. Michael came out to greet us when we arrived and was very friendly."

Stayed one night","⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
This was my first experience with AirBnB. I needed somewhere to crash after driving 8 hours from Rhode Island to see Punxsutawney Phil declare 6 more weeks of winter. I knew places in Punxsutawney would be outside the range of what I wanted to spend to sleep inside for a night, so I expanded my search a bit farther away but more or less on the way home. That’s when I stumbled upon the listing for Mike’s Older House. After standing outside in 14° temperatures for several hours overnight at Gobbler’s Knob, I was hoping Mike could accommodate an early check-in. I messaged him and was relieved when he quickly replied that I could come by as early as 12:30 p.m. Check in was easy and the house was warm. The bed was comfortable and the WiFi worked great. The amenities were exactly what I needed for an efficient out of town stay. Weather-permitting I’ll be back at Mike’s Older House next Groundhog Day.
All the Best,

Having stayed at a hotel, the week prior; it was a very welcome change. He has pretty much everything you need, already there. In case you forget something at home. (shampoos, cutlery and dinner ware, etc)
Met with him on the night i arrived, and enjoyed a pleasant, intelligent conversation. He's a well versed individual.
I would definitely recommend; if you're in the area for work, or just as a brief stop on your way to your ultimate destination."

Stayed one night","Pros: the bed was comfy, the wifi was adequate for a Zoom meeting, and the kitchen was well-equipped and clean. Michael was very friendly and helpful.
Cons: only one: the carpet in the dining room has a bit of an odor. This was not noticeable when standing up, only when I bent down to plug something into the wall socket behind the dinner table. If you're not sensitive to that sort of thing, it may not be a problem."

That's exactly what I got. You will arrive in a quiet neighborhood and park in front of the house. Check in is easy peasy. You enter find a small eating area with snacks and water Mike kindly provides. Clean carpeted floors and a queen size bed (Mike added a small cot for my young nephew that tagged along). Lights out after a long day and we left with the sunrise. Thanked Mike via text and done. If I am ever in the area, I will definitely visit Mike again."

Stayed one night","Mike s place was like a little home away from home. in many respects it was the best rest I've had in my long trip from the west coast. Four windows and a screen door, ac of you want it and surely a heater which there was no need for in July. k cup coffee for a morning wake up time on the porch is pleasant indeed . I appreciated the fantastic shower to refresh oneself after a long trip, a comfortble bed, kitchen table in a corner with two sunny windows etc. Walking in the neighborhood was a big plus because it's safe, old fashioned and hilly (for gd. excercise). Mike's a very gracious host who seems to take pride in providing a very well liked air bnb. He is pleasant, kind and interesting to speak with. You will easily be comfortable here for a short or longer stay. thx. Bonnie"

The highlight for us was the front deck, where we were able to enjoy time together around the fire pit while watching boats go by on the lake and listen to the sounds of nature.
I would absolutely recommend Blue Haven for anyone looking for a getaway at Treasure Lake. A huge thank you to Dana for being so communicative and professional - she made the stay very enjoyable."

Stayed a few nights","""Feels like home"" is what my family said of our stay. My family of four with two teens had plenty of room to spread out and claim their own spaces. The common areas were just right, where we could also spend time together comfortably.
The kitchen is fully equipped with lots of tools, and the dining room is a nice place to have a meal. The bathrooms are very clean with thoughtful amenities. The large TV and fireplace in the living room were easy to use.
The owner also decorated for the season, which I think led even more to the home-away-from-home feeling.
We'll be booking here, again, in the future!"

The apartment was squeaky clean. The linen smelled clean and refreshing. She was very kind and extended our check out time so that we were well rested before the next leg of our trip.
Would definitely recommend this place."

Stayed one night","This apartment is brand spanking new, and very well-appointed.
Parking and getting in were a snap. The host was very responsive and i had no issues to contact her about.
The unit is located inside an apartment building with interesting shared space and some very nice architectural details.
The only caveats i would mention are that it is an interior apartment, and has no outside light, (which isn't a big deal, but worth noting), also, being in a shared building, I could hear the adjacent apartment's residents, (again nothing that was so loud that just turning on the TV or some music didn't fix).
If you are visiting Dubois, and want to stay in town where you can walk to Luigi's or the ballfiields, and stroll the downtown, this is a delightful option."

Kitchen had all the dish-ware we needed for the 5 days we stayed. The AC unit inside worked great and we appreciated having. We loved the large size of the bedroom! Thank you for the complimentary snack basket.
The location was fantastic and conveniently near all the places we had to be.
The only negative is the walls are thin and you could hear all the noises from the apartment next to this rental in the evening.
We thoroughly enjoyed the living space and accommodations we had."

DuBois looks like an interesting town though we arrived the evening before the solar eclipse - along with *many* others. Restaurants were booked!
We had two small dogs with us. There is not much dog-walking space except for the church across the street, which was enough for our small dogs. The pair of mallard ducks weren't so keen on that though!
All in all, it was a great stay."

Stayed with a pet","This apartment was a great option in downtown Dubois. The apartment itself was clean and spacious, parking was easy, and it was a quick walk to get to downtown restaurants. Brittany the host was responsive if I had questions. I didn’t park in the garage because the space for this particular apartment is in the back and involved more maneuvering than I wanted to take on so if you have a large vehicle just be aware of that limitation. I parked in front and it was easy and my car was never disturbed. The place was super quiet overall and the common area is very cool and historic. The only thing to be aware of is the garage is right under this apartment and is fairly loud when it opens/closes. The tenant that parked down there left consistently very early in the morning. If you have a noise sensitive dog or kid staying with you this might bother them. I will absolutely be staying again when I come back to the area!"

Everything in the cottage is clean and comfortable, and the area is charming and walkable, which was perfect for my dog and I.
There were already the necessities you would expect to need, but also space to put everything else you may have brought along. No drawer, cabinet, or counter top was too cluttered to add your own things, though there are thoughtful touches throughout to make the cottage feel like a home.
Dorrie went above and beyond to provide me with the most updated travel guide for the area and was very available by message or text when I had a question or needed something. This is a five star stay in a lovely neighborhood for a great value."

My daughter and I were looking for a nice little town to meet for a round of golf (the next day). Brookville was kind of a ""halfway point"" since I'm from NE Pa and she now resides in NW Pa. Dorothy was wonderful in making sure everything was just right! And it was. Very clean! My daughter and I looking forward to our next visit there."

Stayed one night","Cute little house that sits behind and to the side of the owner's primary residence. (The address of the property is not the street you go on to pull into this place's driveway - you actually drive to the side of the main house. Not a problem unless you're navigating at night and not sure what you're looking for...) The inside is just adorable. The window A/C in the bedroom does a decent job of keeping the entire space cool, although the bathroom can get a little warm on hot days. We were only there for a short time (showed up late that night, left as early as we could drag ourselves out the next morning) so didn't really experience most of the amenities, but the bathroom was surprisingly big and supplies (towels, toilet paper, etc.) were plentiful had we been there longer. One minor caveat - the wifi for guests is 5mhz only. If you have a device that requires the older 2.4mhz standard, it will not be able to connect. Because we were there for such a short time, we did not bother to find a solution, but if you know you have a device with this requirement and will be there longer, you should inquire ahead of time as to options. Dorothy was great at communicating and we would definitely stay again the next time we're in the area!"

If that wasn't enough, she was an excellent host and went above and beyond to help us park our moving truck safely and conveniently. She also set up the pac and play for my daughter and extra bed for my dad and brother. Her kitchen has everything we needed to whip up a quick dinner and breakfast on the go and dishes were a breeze with a dishwasher (rare in these airbnb cottages!).

We stayed during the holiday season, just after Christmas, with the town's beautiful decorations, white lights, and a light blanket of snow.

There was parking right in front and the neighborhood was lovely and quiet. Communicating with Dorothy was a piece of cake.

Dorothy made the sofa bed for us prior to arriving which saved us a lot of time! There were some items in the fridge for breakfast if we needed them. We enjoyed being within walking distance of town and explored the rail trail that was just a 2 minute drive away. We will keep this place in mind for upcoming girl trips!

Stayed one night","My husband, son and I spent one night at Dorothy’s Cardamom Cottage and I can’t recommend this property highly enough! It is even cuter than it looks in the pictures, was spotlessly clean and so welcoming and comfortable. Dorothy has clearly put a lot of effort into the updated, charmingly decorated cottage and a tremendous amount of thought into the comfort of her guests.
She was very communicative and even asked if we would like to have the sofa bed pre-made up for our son since we were arriving late which we appreciated after a long day on the road. She had a drawer full of local restaurant menus (The Courthouse Grille was great for take out), many coffee and tea options and she left fresh fruit and some breakfast staples for us to have in the morning. Other “above and beyond” touches include lovely hand soaps, shampoo and conditioner and really noticeably high quality sheets and towels.
The location of the cottage just off I-80 and just minutes from the very cute downtown Brookeville makes it perfect for either a quick overnight or a home base for exploring the PA Wilds.
A+++ all around!"

I would totally stay here again. The only reason I didn’t give it a 5 was the water pressure was awful.

Stayed one night",Mitch's place is in a country setting which is very quiet and quaint. I didn't get to meet Mitch personally but we spoke on the phone and he was very accommodating to all my needs. Nice little place which is clean and very comfortable. You have everything that a hotel would provide plus more. Enjoyed my stay there and would return. Perfect get-away.

Stayed one night","Great place and value. clean. Farm next door is a plus.
Our only complain is that the instructions to check-in / arrival should be better.
The instructions we got were: ""Check in instructions....The apartment door is beside the garage doors and is unlocked and the lights are on...""
We arrived pretty late (it was a quick stop to rest toward our destination)
Our experience with check-in:
Our gps put us 2 house down, lights off, we knew that was wrong. next door the number didnt match; next (mitch's) one of the number have fallen (my husband put it back up when we finally figured it out) hence we were quite confuse for a bit. We actually park at mitch's because we saw people inside and decided to stop and ring the bell (tried w no respond) to ask around. We had no signal and could not call.
At that point we noticed the garage and decided to try and open the door.
Funny thing is that house is very distict. Either adding a picture of the front of the garage where the apt is OR simple describing it as ""large house with xmas-like lights around front door and a double door garage next to the house. The door to your stay is beside the garage"" would make this much much simpler.
thanks"

The place was very clean and had all that I needed. Mitch was attentive to my emails and as a bivouac it had what the doctor ordered. I departed at 7:am and watched the morning mist and fog burn off as I rolled out of the hills Mitch's place is tucked into and got back on to Rte. 80 back to Connecticut.

If youre driving from PGH check out Zachs for some delicious farm-fresh food. Mitch is very communicative and quick to respond."

There even is a baby goat yoga class on some Saturdays. The apartment is very comfortable and quiet, and the hosts provide breakfast/snack foods, coffee, water and soda."

Stayed one night","Stayed a night here in the middle of a long drive between Ohio and Boston, and absolutely loved this spot. Beautiful views outside — the stars are amazing, and saw late-night fireflies I’ve never seen before. A really nice, quiet country retreat that is not a far drive from the highway, with convenient check-in and helpful communication. Many thoughtful touches inside for the weary traveler. Definitely recommended. Thank you for a great stay and restful sleep!"

There was a fridge and microwave, even the elusive wine bottle opener! There were menus for local restaurants to help us locate a dinner spot. You couldnt ask for more :)"

Finding the place was super easy with Mitch's instructions and the apartment was just the right size. The holiday decorations were adorable. This is a working farm, but for anyone worried there were zero loud morning noises, so you are free to sleep in."

And toiletries, should one forget something, were offered as well. Very thoughtful. I also loved the brochures about the wineries and have every intention of coming back to stay and experience the goodness in the surrounding area. It’s truly a great place. I highly recommend."
