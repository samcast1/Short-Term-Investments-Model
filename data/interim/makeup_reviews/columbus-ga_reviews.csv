Stayed one night","Well worth the price, very quaint place with amenities and whatnot exactly as described. Honestly, the most refreshing part was the cleaning instructions. Most hosts now require you to clean the whole place while paying a cleaning fee, this was much more reasonable and realistic. Thanks to Shaun for the instructions and the communication! For anybody complaining about the neighborhood…..you’re in Columbus, Georgia. It’s not “the hood” and it’s not a rough part. It’s Columbus, Georgia."

Stayed one night","The actual place was great, with plenty of towels, comfortable furniture, and all the necessary appliances and amenities. Unfortunately, the price should have been a red flag for what kind of neighborhood this home was in. The nearby homes appear to be either abandoned or not taken care of, with minimal street lighting making the street very dark at night. The neighborhood just didn't feel the safest and we were not comfortable being outside at night. It is nice that the home does include a security system, which I've personally never seen at an Air BnB."

Stayed a few nights","The area the house is located in is terrible and quite sketchy! There we’re broken down cars and abandoned houses in the neighborhood. The house was dirty, stained floors with urine around the toulets, guest bathtub was dirty and hadn’t been cleaned, stained walls and doors, stained kitchen counter tops, outdated appliances and kitchenware. The add claimed New, it is definitely not new. Quite deceiving! The amount offered should have been a red flag."

We were very close to the downtown area which has numerous bars and restaurants. We opened a bottle of wine, but unfortunately had no wine glasses…no problem, I let Shaun know and I had wine glasses waiting for me on the porch! I would not hesitate to stay there again."

Group trip","We were in town for our son's turning green Army graduation. This was a great location to Fort Moore. The neighborhood was quiet. It is definitely on the edge of an area of town that is in the process of getting remodeled from older original homes so it is a mix of well worn homes and recently redone homes. It felt safe and was quiet. The house is well remodeled and worked well for our needs. The bedrooms are large and comfortable. It was well equipped. Not the latest in appliances but everything was clean and functional. The only thing we realized after we settled in is that there isn't a dining table at all. There are 4 stools at the bar. Not a huge issue, just something to consider if you are planning to have dinner together. Shaun was very proactive and thorough in his communication and follow up. We were there during the record cold snap in January. The house stayed comfortable and he even had provided space heaters for the bedrooms even though we didn't need them."

Stayed a few nights","Imagine being 6 months pregnant, freezing cold, on your last hope with anything outside of food, and all of a sudden, you get to your very first AIRBNB stay here. I literally almost had tears in my eyes when I waddled into Shaun's AIRBNB. It was absolutely BEAUTIFUL. The outside looks small, but the inside is HUGE. It was clean, uniquely decorated, and frankly soooo much more than we expected. The living room was so welcoming and cozy. I went to the kitchen to make my husband some tea and completely forgot that I didn't pack any with us. I closed my eyes, legit prayed that there was some tea there, and by my very humble surprise, there was tea. 🥹🥹
The washer and dryer were conveniently located near the kitchen so, while I waited for the water to boil for the tea, I went ahead and got our clothes washed. Shaun was so accommodating, kind, efficient, and helpful. I was so pleased with our entire stay. We will be back!!"

Stayed a few nights","The house was somewhat clean but the appliances are oldddd. We stayed 4 nights and out of those days we seen 4/5 roaches in the house. In addition, the last night of our stay, we were in bed resting to get on the road the following morning. Out of nowhere we heard 25/30 gunshots and we immediately jumped up and could not go back to bed. As much as I hate to write this review because the host was very friendly, responsive and even brought us trash bags. However, I must be honest as I’ll want someone to be honest with me. If I could do it all over again, I would not book this home. We felt unsafe immediately upon seeing the neighborhood but were eased once coming inside. You can tell the homeowner cares about his property and it was nicely decorated but it could’ve been cleaned better. We pulled out the sofa bed and toys and a book fell out. The sofa had/has French fries under it which can cause a roach infestation. I swept up what I could which I shouldn’t have to. The wifi is also bad"

Shaun was very attentive and even checked in the day after our arrival to ask if our first night in the area was nice and if we needed anything, to not hesitate- very kind and proactive. Only thing I would note for future travelers,(but doesn’t effect my 5-star rating), no bottle/wine opener or wine glasses. Overall everything was amazing!!! Thank you!"

Stayed with kids","The bed linens were dirty and smelled of body odor. One of the pillows on one side smelled of cologne. The comforter on the other bed was very dirty. There weren't any extra sheets or bedding to change. When the host was messaged, he didn't respond until the next morning, saying it would be taken care of. It wasn't. The host also asked he be contacted when checking out. We did, there was no response. The house looked like the pictures. The bathrooms were fairly clean. The rugs looked dirty. We were asked to not wear shoes in the house, we didnt. Im not sure how the bathroom rugs were dirty if people arent wearing shoes. I guess for only one night stay, it was satisfactory at best"

Stayed a few nights","The home was nice, exactly as described, beautiful floors in the living room and kitchen. Very open layout with lots of room. Overall, the neighborhood was quiet but unfortunately very run down and sad looking. With that said, Shaun's places are the nicest on the block! On the positive side, it's very close to the downtown area which is very nice with lots of restaurants and shops. Hot water and good water pressure were a huge plus. And Shaun was a great host, checking in on us, making sure we had everything we needed with clear instructions on where to park, how to set the alarm and what to do upon checkout. Overall, we were close to the softball complex where our daughter was playing for her college so very convenient and the price was nice! Some parents were staying 20 min north in a 'run-down' hotel and paid double the price."

Only suggestions would be a table of some sort to eat at as a family versus only the bar and a few more pots, pans, glasses, bowls & utensils. We could of used a bigger pot for cooking spaghetti. Having glass glasses to drink from would have been nice. But overall very pleased with our stay."

We did lots in the area, but the house is definitely so cozy, it was absolutely wonderful to have a place for my son and kids to just stay in and relax after all our running around. Added perk…the front porch was so beautiful!! My kids, Mom and I loved sitting on the front porch in January with 65 degree weather!!"

Stayed with kids",Shawn’s home itself was very cute. The inside of the home matched the description it had posted and it was cozy. The front door is a little un sturdy but aside from that it was cute. The location on the other hand was not. It was in a run down neighborhood where houses were either run down or destroyed. The neighborhood looked trashy. The people behind us looked like they were doing drug deals in their yard. The neighbor next to us completely ignored us when we would say hi but sat on his porch for an hour indiscreetly looking at our truck and the belongings we had in the back. The whole atmosphere was uncomfortable and honestly we didn’t feel safe to stay there with our children. We left after a couple hours there. We didn’t want to stay there with our kids. I let Shawn know our feelings and our concerns. He said he couldn’t provide any type of refund and than questioned why we felt the way we did. The house itself was cute but we most definitely would never return again.

The neighborhood was quiet and while we saw the neighbors it was not like we were camped out in each other's front yards. It was easy to navigate within the area and there are a variety of restaurants and shopping centers within a five-minute drive. Checking in and out was so easy and Shaun was so responsive to my questions and needs. If we come back to the Columbus area I know that I will try to book with Shaun first!

The instructions coming in and out of the rental are clear and not over the top. We didn’t receive a list of tasks to complete prior to leaving the rental which was nice to see. The home itself is comfy. The rooms are big and clutter free. It’s super clean and parking is always available. The bed is huge and extremely comfortable! We slept so well, which has not always been the case at other Air BNB’s. We would come back to Shaun’s when visiting Columbus again."

Stayed a few nights","Loved our stay at this cottage. It was perfect for an anniversary get away (and day trip to Providence Canyon) and had everything we needed. Really clean and modern conveniences. We loved being right near downtown Columbus and being able to walk to the downtown (uptown Columbus) area. The lovely river walk is only a few blocks away. The location is really great as we love to walk to restaurants and attractions. Good parking. Loved the historic charm of the cottage and the modern amenities provided, little details like USB ports on the end stand. Also loved having a full kitchen and laundry room. Super impressed with the cleanliness. Shaun was proactive and made sure we had everything we needed. Would love to come back and stay again sometime!"

Half mile from all of the shops and restaurants and the boardwalk. If I come back and visit again I would happily stay at any of this host’s AirBnbs.

Everything was just as described. The place was clean. I loved the fact that it had a washer & dryer. There was ample parking & the house was super cute!

Stayed a few nights","Pros:
Sean was very responsive and friendly. The cottage was clean, the couch and bed were comfortable. The cottage is affordable.
Cons:
I checked out early. I processed a refund through airbnb when Sean became unresponsive-
The shower was comfortably warm for approximately two minutes and then changes to lukewarm….I understand there are regulations but the temperature is well below what it could be.
The sink drain was clogged. He stated that it was not clogged, and that I only had the drain closed. Black particles were rising up from the drain so not sure how it could have been closed. I provided a photo to airbnb support.
The ad describes occasional noise from the train but does not tell you that the train is very close, enough to shake the cottage, comes by approximately every hour while blaring its horn…
Basically I didn’t sleep, my shower was cold, and I couldn’t use the bath sink.
I was happy with the support I received through airbnb, and a refund was processed quickly."

Stayed with kids","Pros: This house was cute, clean, and well-stocked. I loved the charm. The king bed was very comfortable. It’s also very close to the downtown strip and the Colosseum. We stayed one night, and it was perfect for what we needed. The host was very communicative and responsive.
Possible cons: There is some street noise that can be heard, although I didn’t find it bothersome. The couch in the living room is not a pull-out, so, the king bed is the best option for everyone to sleep in. The water heater could be turned up a bit so that the shower could get hotter. It would only reach a lukewarm temp when turned all the way up. Lastly, there needs more security/lock options on the front door. Another guest had the code to our door, and they made an appearance in the middle of the night during our stay. If there was a doorknob lock or chain lock added, it would feel more secure and prevent intruders."

Stayed one night","We were passing through and just needed a place to crash for the night. The cottage was just as listed, however it’s next to a busy main road so you could hear the traffic in the living room. It wasn’t as bad in the bedroom but if you’re a light sleeper and don’t like city sounds then you might be uncomfortable, it didn’t bother us, bed was comfortable. There was an alarm system so that did put our mind at ease. I loved that it was close to downtown, this cottage is the closest to the main road but buffered by a hot dog shop. There was another hot dog shop across the cottage which we thought was funny, we didn’t get to try any hot dogs to see which was better. All and all we enjoyed our stay."

Stayed a few nights","The accommodation is comfortable , beautifully decorated and very well equipped . Be careful, on the other hand, that this is a bedroom only and that gives access to the bathroom... so ideal for a couple! Problem if someone sleeps in the living room on the sofa bed, which is rather average comfort. Also the proximity to a busy road can harm sleep ...
This home is on the edge of the historic district. You can visit it on foot , very pleasant walk and for a few minutes more, access to the main street.
Suggestion: Include a visit to the Naval Civil War Museum and bike rental (Ride on bikes shop on Broadway ) to see the Riverwalk ."

To be right next to a busy road, the traffic noise was actually very mild for most of our stay. The location is phenomenal — only a short drive to the downtown area and about 12+ minutes to Fort Benning. This was a deciding factor when we chose Apple Cottage for our stay in Columbus. Shaun is an exceptional host. We had trouble with the alarm system our first night and he (thankfully) came immediately to our rescue! You can tell he takes great care of his rentals and truly wants guests to feel right at home. Very grateful for the wonderful memories my family and I made during our stay!"

Stayed a few nights",I was pretty sad that I expected to rent an “entire home” and the home looked beautiful in the pictures but when I got there and checked in it turned out to be a bedroom separated from the rest of the home by a door with a lock on both sides. It felt very uncomfortable not knowing what room the bedroom I was staying in was attached to where a whole family could rent the rest of the house. This is listed as an “entire home” and advertised as a “duplex” when it absolutely is not. A duplex is defined as a home attached to another home separated by a wall. Two completely separate dwellings. It is an old home as well so you are able to hear every step taken and conversations clearly through the wall and the door departing the house has a lot of gap and damage to it. I ended up cancelling my reservation minutes after checking in after a long day of traveling… very disappointed my the misrepresented listing…she was responsive but very defensive that it WAS a separate home comparing to a hotel

Stayed a few nights",This was a cute little spot for 2 people to stay while in Columbus. Was there moving my son into Fort Moore. It is just like described. The only downside is as described in the listing it is a duplex and the noise from the other side can be quiet loud when trying to relax/sleep. The other guests get the front patio of the house and if they are out there just talking you can hear every word why you are trying to sleep because the head of the bed is at the patio window side. Clean and worked for what we needed for the price. Shower was awesome!!

Stayed a few nights","This is a very nice historic house. It’s a very short, pleasant walk to the river and downtown (or Uptown, as locals insistently call it), and you could spend hours wandering from street to street looking at the distinctive local architecture. The house is divided into two units. I wasn’t crazy about the fact that the bedroom in the one where I stayed is adjacent to the living room of the other unit. Every sound carries, which is openly admitted. The other guests were quiet and respectful, so it was no issue for me. You can always set the thermostat to continuous fan. The bathroom shower is very nice—plenty of water pressure and spacious. The unit is tastefully decorated, and most importantly, the bed was comfortable. Too many places have such soft mattresses that you sink into the middle, so it was nice to have a firmer, more level mattress. Overall, I was very pleased with my choice."

Callaway Gardens and Providence Canyon State Park are each a 45 minute drive, and the there’s so much to do right there in downtown Columbus, too! Peaceful neighborhood, and definitely want to come back to the area. Keep in mind, the house is divided into two separate spaces as a duplex, and there’s a chance you’ll have guests staying in the space, on the other side of the home (all separated with secure locked doors). I had no issues with noise, but just a heads up. Highly recommend if you’re looking for a little getaway. Thank you!"

We enjoyed the beautiful & private setup outside, cooking meals in the kitchen with all of the supplies she had available, the extra cozy living room with the many blankets she had available, the warm showers, and the bed was so comfortable & clean, the fireplace added a nice touch 😊 Other than the fact that we were able to hear everything from the other side of the duplex (which we understood comes with a wooden house & they had a lot of people over) we felt safe & somewhat private & we both loved our stay. We wanted to feel at home together again and this place definitely did the job!"

Stayed a few nights",Stephanie's place is amazing. So much bigger than I thought. Loved the cottage feel of the place and it was in a safe area. My only itch was that the space makes a lot of odd small sounds when you're walking around the place. It almost makes you think there is someone else in the space with you which can be scary at first but besides that( can also be because of neighbors walking around since it is a duplex)...this place is a great steal for the Columbus GA area.

Stayed a few nights","Stephanie was amazing! Her house is a duplex, and I had the smaller side, which was more than enough. When I got there, the kitchen light was burned out. I sent her a note, which she is very quick with responding to, and she offered to come over immediately, but I told her the next day was fine, as it was already late when I checked in. She showed up the next morning on schedule with her ladder (very high ceilings!) and put in new bulbs, then was sweet enough to show me the other half of the house since I was curious, and then stayed over an hour just talking and telling me the history of the neighborhood and the historic homes. I really liked her. I was there for a convention at the convention center, and it was about a 3 block walk. I hardly used my car for anything! Even walked to lunch and down by the river front. Gorgeous neighborhood of old homes. As a Realtor, I was eating it all up!"

(Also may have been more quiet since it was a holiday and it appears to have a state college downtown.) Lots of good eats if you are a foodie. (Mabella is a MUST!) Riverwalk is 2 blocks away, perfect for multiple day/evening walks or run with our dog when not playing in the enclosed side yard space provided. All amenities were perfect, shower and laundry were nice - enough hot water for both to go at the same time. Even cookware was good quality. Bed was supportive with pillow top comfort and sheets super soft - Hard to want to get out of that coziness in the mornings! Place was larger than expected and very clean - which is always a worry for me and my allergies when staying in spaces that accept pets- no problems here! Gate was a little troublesome to open until we figured out how aggressive we needed to be with it. Neighbor noise/food smells was minimal - normal for what you would expect in duplex/apartment living. Would book again!"

We loved the Keurig machine and the coffee/creamer/sugar provided so we could at least start our day with a nice cup of coffee while getting ready before heading out. There are dishes/mugs/wine glasses and opener for use. Table and chairs, mini sink and fridge and microwave. Great spot for bringing back take-out or reheating, not cooking. Everything very clean and little extras provided. Highly recommend!"

Stayed a few nights","Literally what an AirBnb should be. Super cozy and tidy, quiet neighborhood, great amenities, excellent location (2 minutes from downtown and 15 minutes to base), and it was a generously sized place for a ""tiny house"". The shower was even quite sizable. I stayed for a week and it quickly became home and a great place to relax at the end of the day. Everything has been thought of including great climate controls, toiletries if needed, a mini fridge that actually had a decent amount of space, and a place to hang clothing and jackets. Andree & Paul were always quick to respond and checked in to make sure I was doing ok and see if I needed anything. 10/10 I look forward to staying here again."

AC was not efficient which made for uncomfortable evenings even with two fans and the bed seems very short. Being 6’01 it was not the best for my length as I was hitting both the headboard and footboard but overall I would recommend and stay again. Fantastic communication and fast response.

Stayed with kids","The host was very nice and communicative. The interior was very lovely and you could tell they put a lot of time into renovating the space. Unfortunately it was very hot during our stay. The only air conditioning was a Toshiba portable air conditioner that attaches to a window (was not attached well). There was a ceiling fan and a oscillating fan but it was still extremely warm. It made sleeping uncomfortable.
We were asked to empty the air conditioner water though they offered to do it. Air conditioner was working really hard so we had to empty it about 3X a day. Beds were also very in comfortable. The full size bed was hard and the pull out beds mattress was thin and you could feel the springs. The cover on the mattress had other people’s hair on it. WiFi wasn’t very strong so streaming on my iPad was difficult. There is no tv so my iPad was our only source of entertainment during down time.
Not very comfortable for our 3 person family. Definitely don’t recommend for summertime."

You can walk ""uptown"" in about 10 min and you get to walk by beautiful historic homes from the 1800s. We also took the opportunity to walk the RiverWalk trail (just about two or three blocks from the stay), which was beautiful.

Stayed a few nights","Can’t say enough good things about Andree’s guest house. Nestled behind a beautiful 1850’s historic district home, this guest house is perfect for a couples or single traveler weekend getaway. Within walking distance of the riverwalk and downtown, it is located in the ideal location. The guest house was very clean and comfortable. We especially loved seeing the cat outside on the porch. The street in which it is located is quiet and safe. We felt comfortable walking to and from the downtown at night and during the day. Highly suggest this guest house and will plan to return again someday!"

Stayed a few nights","Cute small cozy place for 2, I think this would be crowded for 4 guests.  Hosts were friendly and accomodating, we were able to check in early to catch a nap after a long drive. 
Restroom sink is small, it was much easier to wash my face and brush my teeth using the kitchenette sink.  
Great location by the Riverwalk.  We went to Callaway and Providence State Park, this Airbnb is an in-between location. There is a lot of train horns that go off starting around 930PM, and I feel like it goes off agian early morning around 5AM, if your a light sleeper this will be an issue. Overall a nice place to stay, clean and well lit lights when you walk around the house toward the airbnb at night.  I would book agian if we come back to Columbus."

Stayed over a week","I stayed for two weeks in this little house and it is great: so clean and functional. Host Andree was really welcoming and helpful with quick answers when I had a question. I had never been to Columbus before and this was a great choice of area to be in. I was on my own for part of my visit and felt safe walking the neighborhood and on the riverwalk. The house is just like the adorable photos so you will not be disappointed. The kitchen area has a microwave, roomy fridge with a little freezer, keurig coffee maker, kettle and toaster. Lots of coffee and tea and creamers were provided. Great for breakfasts and lunches and we mostly sampled the great restaurants in the area for dinner although the little freezer had a surprising amount of room for frozen microwavable dinners. Highly recommend 11th and Bay and Mabella's for dinner (both a bit $$ tho), and once we discovered the Iron Bank Coffee shop (sooo inexpensive!!) our days were complete. We did not like the Buckhead Steakhouse - just way too expensive for the quality of the meal. To sum up.....loved my stay in the little house and hope to return!! Thanks Andree!!"

The neighborhood was a nice area. The house is beautiful. The pool was refreshing. The kitchen was very useful alot of appliances available like 2 refrigerators, coffee maker, smoothie maker, Toaster, griller to make grilled cheese for kids. The board games were very useful and entertaining as well as game room arcade game. There was plenty of space for my large family group.The beds were excellent very soft and comfy with nice comfy linens. I would definitely recommend this location.They provided enough towels, there was a washer and dryer. They also had basic hygiene shampoo and bodywash in the bathrooms in case you forget to pack yours.The only issue we had was make sure you don't accidentally lock the bottom lock of the front door. That locked us out for a hour. But Adi took care of it asap. Had someone come with a key to rescue us."

Stayed with kids","We had the best weekend at Dianna’s place! It was so beautiful & peaceful. It was the perfect spot for our family to spend time together, as we were visiting with our son for his Army AIT graduation. We throughly enjoyed every bit of what this property had to offer. We relaxed, we swam, we used the zip line & played on the swing set, we loved the horses, the ducks, the friendly cat :) we had a fire & made s’mores too. We felt so welcome & right at home. Everything was perfect! Thank you so much for everything. If we’re ever in the area again, we’d love to come back. Dianna is the nicest lady & id recommend this place to anyone :)"

It is a bit of a tight squeeze getting into the property if you have a big truck. But an SUV or a small car will have no problem.

Stayed with kids","I’ve said it before and I will keep shouting this until I no longer can but staying at EverBe is always like coming home!! Diana has thought of everything-this particular trip it had been extremely hot and humid all day and like any home in the south it takes a while for the upstairs to cool down lol but of course Diana‘s already thought of that because there’s a fan in the closet and that was all we needed to help circulate that cool air a little faster for our liking. I’m quite positive she has exactly what you need before you realize you need it ready for you to use while you stay here.
Even better is that Diana has become like family for us. She definitely goes above and beyond as a host to make you feel comfortable with out ever crossing that line of being TOO up close and personal. Because, after a long trip, you want a friendly face but you also want to unpack and rest 😂
We look forward to many more trips staying at EverBe!"

The property was beautiful and we enjoyed everything and our granddaughter really enjoyed the pool, feeding the horse and playground, she even did the zipline. We would highly recommended."

It was enough of a rural setting that provided peace and a beautiful scenery, though close enough to any restaurant, stores, and attractions in the area. Very convenient!
We enjoyed hanging out at the cottage where my son was able to relax and enjoy home comfort with us. It helped him unwind from his training and prepare for him for the next phase.
Dianna was very nice and her hospitality was amazing! Would definitely stay again!"

It’s a great place especially for anyone with children and while it’s peaceful and away from all the hustle and bustle you can still have groceries and food delivered or go out and have a nice dinner yourself. Don’t even get me started on the house lol I could probably go on and on for days about how gracious and kind Diana is and how much of her heart and soul is felt on this property. I literally have no reason that you shouldn’t stay here… It’s clean, quiet, they literally have everything you could possibly imagine that you would ever need on a trip and then some and two beautiful horses that you can feed carrots and apples to!! What’s not to love??"

Perfect, safe location with easy access parking. A mile from all the good things in Columbus, walkable or driveable. Wish we could have stayed longer!"

Stayed one night","For context, I stay at AirBnBs on a regular basis. This was one of my favorites. When you get to the property, the cottage has a sign on it that it's on the National Register of Historic places and dates back to 1850. A very simple structure on the outside, but then you open the door and it's like Dr. Who's tardis. I'm convinced it's bigger on the inside. Spacious kitchen. Snacks provided, awesome comfortable bed, multiple places to work, modern and historic at the same time. And then when I woke up in the morning, we're a block away from the river walk in a beautiful historic neighborhood. I walked to uptown along the trail and the downtown is thriving. There were vendors everywhere and the stores and restaurants were awesome.. All in easy walking distance along the Chattahoochee."

The property is so well lit we felt 100% safe no matter the time of night. The property is beautiful inside and out, you will feel comfortable and right at home. Be sure to pet the puppers too, they are so sweet. Shaun & his family are very welcoming and super friendly. I had the pleasure of meeting his wife during my morning coffee in the courtyard. Location is fabulous! We walked to Broadway with ease, the market on the corner provides several options, and we were able to get to base with ease. I would not hesitate to stay again. Hope to return to the Carriage House or another of Shaun's property on our next trip to base."

Shaun is very receptive and responsive! Would definitely book with Shaun again! God Bless!"

Stayed a few nights","Shaun was great and we really enjoyed our stay! The place is well-worth the price Shaun was asking. Clean, private, safe and two sweet dogs always in the courtyard.
That being said, there were a couple things that left us feeling like it could have been better. Being in a downstairs unit had us woken up early when the folks upstairs got up. The couch was pretty uncomfortable also, which wasn’t a big deal to me but it might be to someone else.
All-in-all, for the price, this place is awesome!!"

Stayed a few nights","Shaun’s place was true to its photos: an intimate space with a cute kitchenette. The only issues I had while staying with Shaun is that he did not state explicitly that he would be onsite the entire time we were there. If you’re looking for a place of complete seclusion or privacy, this space may not be the best for you. What tipped things over the edge was by the second and third day of our stay, my partner and I experienced a myriad of different noises ranging from lots of loud banging from the upstairs quarters, children playing basketball outside our bedroom window (these were apparently Shaun’s children, another thing we weren’t informed of) and a very loud leaf blower. All this caused us to leave for a few hours just to get some peace of mind. Clearly he hadn’t had things in order by the time of our arrival. All this said, he wasn’t as accommodating as he could’ve been. This felt more like we were staying in a spare room of a family home rather than us being in a private flat."

Pros:
- Great location. Short walking distance to downtown Columbus.
- Parking spaces are nice and its in a quiet neighborhood.
- Has all the amenities you can need.
- Wifi works fine for working remotely and they have a smart TV.
Cons:
- The floor and home isn't the cleanest place and there are flies in the shower/bathroom and roach traps in places that made me worried there might be roaches.
- The home is part of a duplex between upstairs and downstairs. This house is the downstairs portion of the duplex. The upstairs was really loud and there is little sound proofing and so for 2 of the 3 nights, I was wakened by the people upstairs stomping or dancing or whatever they were doing."

Stayed with kids","Can’t say enough about how much we enjoy Shaun’s properties! This specific location is so wonderful. Super close to downtown with tons of food and activities. The Airbnb itself is always spotless and comfortable. It’s great to have a washer and dryer and full kitchen. Easy parking, it’s quiet and super close to Benning, colunbus and Phenix city."

Stayed with kids",We had a lovely stay at Shaun's place. I wanted to be someplace walkable and the location was perfect - it was about a 10 min walk to many restaurants and bars in uptown and about a 5 min walk to the Riverwalk. Shaun communicated excellent check-in instructions and made the stay enjoyable and easy. I would definitely stay here again.

Stayed a few nights",What a great stay we had! Will definitely recommend Shaun’s ABB to our friends and family. He kept in touch with us and our needs. Quiet and private and had I been traveling by myself would have felt safe to be alone. We will be back.

Stayed a few nights","Comfortable, cozy, clean, well lit and climate controlled.
Shaun is very responsive. My daughter and I were there for a Fort Benning event….not close to the air bnb, but easy to call cab service to get there.
And so much fun to come back to downtown which is within walking distance of air bnb. Shaun’s suggestions for restaurants, cafes and activities were great."
