To impress me is very difficult, however the cleanliness, and the amount of detail did just that . I enjoyed the tin roof during the rain storm and the fireplace was very relaxing.

Stayed a few nights","This tiny home has everything you could want in a full-size Airbnb! Cyndy has thought of everything to make this little space feel more than enough. Full kitchen, the sink faucet has a light when the water is on, extra sink surface in the bathroom, plenty of towels, all of the bath soaps, lotion, comfortable bed, smart Roku TV, cute outdoor patio, Kurig, Brita, coffee cups and snacks. The driveway was a little steep for us, haha! But Cyndy provided clear directions ahead of time so we would know what to expect. Definitely recommend this tiny home if you need a place to sleep while you’re out-and-about in the area!"

We were visiting our son who attends WCU. We would love to stay here again when we visit as it's very close to campus/his apartment. We went out to eat some, but did have a few meals at the house and had what we needed to cook with-even had a great selection of spices. It was nicely decorated and had extra space heaters. I'm very cold natured, so I appreciated being able to pull a heater close while we watched TV at night! Thanks for the great place Erik!"

It felt very spacious for a tiny home and it was beautifully decorated with Christmas decor and indoor lighting which made it feel special. He was super helpful and left lights on for us because he knew we were arriving late. The place was super spacious and had everything we needed and then some. It is just a short drive to downtown Sylva and a little ways further to the Smoky Mountains.

Stayed with a pet","My husband and I booked this place for a little weekend getaway. This was my first time booking on Airbnb and this place completely blew us away!! Beautiful private cabin, some yard space to walk our dog, and all the amenities plus more that you would expect at an Airbnb. Our favorite part was that the loft was accessed by carpeted stairs which made it perfect for our dog to sleep upstairs as well. We were about an hour from Fontana lake and Asheville which was perfect considering we wanted somewhere secluded and quiet but with the option of things to do during the day. Book this place for the PERFECT home away from home!!!"

We have stayed at many places through the years. This was by far, the best! We will definitely be back! The hosts, Randall and Dawn, were very helpful and pleasant to work with.
Thank you for sharing your lovely home with us. Until next time…"

Right next to WCU and we have two daughters who play on the soccer team so this is a great place for the weekend and to watch soccer. Very well equipped kitchen which helps us make home cooked meals for our girls and their roommates.

Stayed with kids","We thoroughly enjoyed our Labor Day weekend stay here. The entire experience was excellent, including communication with the property manager and owner, cleanliness, location, and amenities. Everything was just as advertised. The kitchen was well stocked, including little things like spices and zip lock bags. The bathrooms included soap and shampoo and plenty of towels. The mattresses in the bedrooms were super comfortable. The entire place was very cozy. The view of the mountains from the screened-in porch was very scenic. The location was superb, just minutes from the WCU campus, yet it felt so secluded in a very quaint private community. It was very easy to get to Sylva for food and supplies. Also very close to so many activities - including hiking, tubing, kayaking, sight-seeing, the Blue Ridge Parkway, Harrah's and so much more.
Randall and Dawn were superior hosts. They responded very quickly to the questions we had. A few have mentioned the lack or parking and it is advertised as parking for just 2, but we found it very easy to park the three vehicles we had in our party. We would definitely book again!! 10/10."

We go hiking at least once or twice a year in North Carolina so we’ve stayed at many places throughout Sylva, Asheville, Waynesville and the surrounding cities near Cullowhee. This place by far was the nicest and the best value out of anything else that we’ve seen. Even the Comfort Inn that was down the street cost significantly more. The house was extremely nicely kept, spacious and comfortable. The location was perfect as well. You’re close to everything you need, but just secluded enough for a quiet and peaceful getaway. We’ll definitely be booking this place again next time! Thank you Dawn and Randall!"

Thoughtfully provided extras like snacks, coffee, washes, lotions, and detergents. Even Epsom salts for the soaker tub - a detailed that was very much appreciated by my wife.
Very comfortably furnished - living room seating was most excellent for falling asleep while reading a book... We only used one of the bedrooms, mattress and linens were comfy enough that we were looking for tags to see what they were!
I would absolutely recommend this place to any of my friends looking for a quiet getaway - and if you want to get out and about Jackson County in particular Sylva, Dillsboro, and Cullowhee have plenty of local color, and casual and semi-upscale dining..."

It sits on a nice little hill, in a private driveway. The beds we just sank into, they were so soft and warm, so much better then a hard bed at a hotel. Greta was responsive and when I asked if she had a clothes steamer so I didn't have to pack one, she dropped one off the night before we got in.

There are neighborhood dogs that are very friendly that visit the property. The fire pit was very nice and the deck was perfect for enjoying morning coffee. The layout of the house was perfect, the master is on the opposite side of the house as the other two bedrooms. Rooms are all spacious and clean. You can hear donkeys, cows and dogs from all around with the house being on the mountain. Such a beautiful place. There isn’t a lot of dresser space so you need to rely on closet space. Pots and pans are a bit used but very reliable. Would definitely take my family to this property again. The hosts messaged us to ensure we were enjoying our stay. Very friendly."

This is of NO fault of Greta but solely of mine. I should have known better and just want to remind anyone else staying here, don’t expect to access online info until you get logged into the WiFi.

After our very long drive, and arriving just at dark, the lights were all on for us (and ice maker turned on - thank you) so we really felt welcome.
The location is very private and peaceful. Home was very clean and well stocked with everything we needed. As we do most cooking at home, having such a fully stocked kitchen with lots of spices and condiments was greatly appreciated.
Greta was very easy to get hold of and responsive. Highly recommend this beautiful home."

There are a few mountain hounds to deal with, but they seem harmless overall. They usually come check you out, say you're not from around here, let out a couple of barks to let you know that and then move on. There is a loose, gravelly part on the road to the house. Been that way for awhile. Just take it slow and steady. Our top pick to stay at when we are in the Whee"

Stayed a few nights","Greta's place is comfortable, stylish and very clean. We travel a lot and this is one of the best Airbnb rentals we had. We loved the location, secluded but close to town, in the middle of the area to explore Blue Ridge Parkway, trails, and waterfalls.
We also want to clear up concerns about GPS service.
GPS signals come from the satellites and are accessible almost everywhere. Cell service is provided by antennas and is usually spotty in the mountains. So, you’re losing cell service, not GPS. To keep directions you need to enable, i.e. download, offline maps for the area in Google Maps and it’ll help not only to find directions to the house, but also for other destinations in the mountains. For all our stay we never had any problem with finding the house.
Also, while the road is steep by Florida standards, it’s rather common for the hilly areas and we didn’t have any problems with it, it’s well worth the view from the house."

Stayed a few nights","We have family in Cullowhee that we visit, and over the years we've stayed in six different Airbnb homes in the area. Greta's house was one of our favorites. It was spotlessly clean, and well appointed and provisioned. It's located near the top of High Top mountain, in a private and beautiful setting. The road is pretty steep, and has several tight blind curves. Four wheel drive isn't needed, but go slow in those few places. There isn't any thru traffic, just residents, so we had no issues. It's close to the WCU campus, and the charming town of Sylva is about ten-fifteen minutes away. We had a fine time during our visit at Greta's."

Stayed one night","After staying in this house it's easy to see why Greta is rated a super host. What a great place to enjoy the Southern Appalachians. Driving up the holler you get a little bit of a through back experience with the more down-home residences that saddle up to the road and creek bed. You turn left off the little mountain road and head what seems to be about straight up, up a narrow mountain road. If your a flat-lander it gives you a little introduction to mountain living. The house is beautifully situated in a little cove near the top of the mountain with beautiful mountain views and only a couple homesteads nearby. There is a nice hike up behind the house to the top of the mountain. The house is a bit nicer than most Airbnb's I've visited with a beautiful tile shower in one bathroom and a deep tub in the master with bubble bath available. The doors, floors and much of the woodwork is beautiful natural wood. The deck is spacious with beautiful natural wood railing and there also a nice fire circle to sit around in the evenings. Through out the house there were little extras like cookies and snacks, the afore mentioned bubble bath, spies, sugar and other condiments in the kitchen, and we even were treated to ice cream cones in the freezer.
If you don't mind a little drive up the mountain this is a beautiful, comfortable place to stay. We are already making plans to head back.

Stayed about a week","Greta’s place is fabulous! It’s private, well furnished, and cozy. The garden tub makes for the most relaxing baths and the beds were comfortable. Lots of outdoor activities to do in the area. We hiked everyday, even once from the front door! Greta was a great host, quickly responded, supplied some amenities, and when we had some snow, left some emergency supplies at the door for us. But was also very respectful of our privacy. Fair warning that it’s a steep drive up to the house but very worth it for the views. Great stargazing too. We also brought 2 dogs and they loved it! They made quick friends of the mountain dogs (around 4-5 meandered by throughout the week), who were all friendly to our dogs and us. Overall Greta’s place was perfect!"

My husband and our baby joined and enjoyed the large lawn and pavilion alongside the river. It's in a BEAUTIFUL community tucked away from the main highway and all the homes are so new. It felt very safe. The space itself was like a deluxe hotel room size and the bonus space downstairs would be nice if we were staying longer but we didn't use it much. The closet was large enough to squeeze in a pack n play that we brought so the baby could sleep while we watched tv. I would definitely come back again and if we had friends I would rent the larger house, gorgeous!"

From the minute we got out of the car and heard the river, we knew this location was special.
The “Tiny house” was so perfectly appointed, taking into consideration, everyone’s needs. From a small kitchen, equipped for large meals, to plenty of spare blankets for a chilly night. ( though the heater worked great!)
Being around the corner from our son’s apartment ( WCU ) and the baseball field made this stay a perfect 5 star!
We will be back ALOT over the next few years!

The property is exactly as described and pictured...but the pictures cant describe the peacefulness of the property. It is only .5 mi from Harrill Hall at WCU (which is why we went) which means campus is technically walking distance, but I wouldn't walk due to the blind curves and hills in the roads. But if you have gone home, looked at your pictures from a place you have been, and thought ""the pictures just don't capture what we saw"" this is that type of place. The property is on the river and sitting on the porch you can hear the river. The property is very well maintained and gorgeous... Lots more to say, but you have to stay to understand. Thank you to the owners for such a nice property."

ONLY complaint we have is that the proximity to the “main” house is a little uncomfortable - we felt a little awkward using the backyard amenities while another guest was staying there. Hard to feel like the spaces are separated.
Other than that - perfect. We will definitely use this spot again on the way to Myrtle Beach."

Stayed a few nights","Thank you for my stay!!! It is a beautiful little cottage, and VERY comfortable. I love that it is literally tmin from WCU where my son is going to college. This made a very comfortable, peaceful, and happy visit with my son. Next time I might bring my dogs with me as I know your place is pet friendly. I honestly love the beauty of the surroundings with it being Fall time, and I would have never known it was near the University and some of the off campus student housing. The only thing I could hear were the leaves, birds, and my son's marching band.🥰"

Half a mile from WCU means getting to a football game is a snap - walkable, too! Perfect location for parents and friends attending events on campus.
So close to fun dining and shopping in Sylva and Dillsboro.
Looking forward to staying here again!"

There is a spiral staircase in the place to get to the bed which can concern some people, but we had no problems getting up and down the staircase. The water and shower itself were super hot and amazing."

Stayed a few nights","We enjoyed our stay at Margo's small and cozy cabin. The weather varied during our week-long stay in Cullowhee, but anything we needed to stay comfortable was already somewhere in the space. The kitchen had all the utensils we would need. The building and the spaces inside (living/kitchen area, upstairs bedroom, porch and balcony) are unique, sometimes quirky, but the art, artifacts, and furnishings are always warm and inviting. Even though the cabin is part of a neighborhood, its placement and resulting views make the place feel very private. The view over the balcony is of trees and mountains only.
Do keep in mind, the space is small, the kitchen diminutive (but very functional), and the shower space best for one person at a time. You could have more than two people stay---there is a pull-out settee for an extra sleeping place---but you can't mind being pretty close to each other most of the time! Use the extra balcony space as much as you can.
We were lucky to see hummingbirds at the feeder Margo provides on the balcony. Maybe you will too!"

Stayed a few nights","Margo's Whee House was an excellent choice for my visit to Cullowhee! The small cabin was in great shape, was fully stocked with expected amenities, and was in a very quiet neighborhood. As others have mentioned in their reviews, it really is less than five minutes to the WCU campus if that is your destination, and similarly close to the nearby towns of Cullowhee and Sylva. Margo was a great and friendly host. One final comment -- I stay in a lot of AirBnB properties and this was one of the few where both the WiFi and the television actually worked! It made the stay so much more enjoyable to remain connected to work and entertainment while in the cabin after a long day out and about!"

Stayed a few nights","The premises is not as private as the pictures make it seem. We expected to have a small plot surrounded by the woods, but the Whee House is actually in the backyard of the host, only about 50 feet from the main house. Even the more private balcony off the back of the Whee House was in view of the main house, which was not the type of unit we intended to book for our trip.
Despite expecting a more private location, we did enjoy our stay. Margo was very friendly and a good communicator, and her dog Virginia was also very friendly and fun to have around.
There were some slight issues with ants on the kitchen counter and kitchen wall, and the couch and shower smelling a little musty, but these were somewhat expected since it is a cabin by the woods."

A quiet neighborhood with no through traffic but a very short drive to grocery stores, restaurants and anything you need in Sylva, or Cashiers/Highlands if you want a scenic drive to other beautiful places. We had to go to Asheville on business one day and it was an easy 1 hour drive to our meeting on a nice parkway. All instructions online and in the house were easy to follow and accurate. Dawn and Randall were quick to respond if we needed something but their home and organized set up were so good that no needs were left unmet onsite. We look forward to a return visit!"

If you don't want to venture that far, within 15 minutes you can find all sorts of breweries, restaurants and little shops in Silva, NC. The Cherokee Casino isn't a far drive as well.
The house is exactly as advertised! If you don't want to do any of the activities listed above, you can always sit on the back patio of the house and listen to the Tuckesegee River flow by. It's hard to describe how fantastic the view and sounds are! we hope to come back some day."

It is close to the small town of Sylva which had lots of cute restaurants and shops and we were able to get to Asheville in about 45 minutes. Overall great experience and would definitely go back!

Our visit was to connect with a physician we waited 4 years to meet for my son’s speech. If it was not for the surroundings I do not feel the connection would have happened.
I hated to leave and the host was more than supportive and was happy for our success. I hated to leave !
We will return without a doubt!!"

Bathroom showers & mirrors over the sinks are awesome. It’s exactly like the pictures and we felt right at home. Beds are so comfortable. Take a walk down to the Pavilion. It is beautiful. So peaceful here. Feeling very Blessed to have found this quiet retreat. We loved every thing about this place. Do make a mental note that you have 16 steps up to the door. But so worth it.

The home is modern, very welcoming, spotless, beautifully furnished and had everything we needed to be comfortable. The main outdoor space (screened porch) is beyond relaxing- it is huge and has comfortable furniture. It looks out directly onto the river, the flowing water is mesmerizing. There is also a fire pit beside the river which we did not use this visit. The neighborhood is quiet and it was easy to walk the dog 20-25 minutes without having to go up any steep incline. The wifi worked great and there was a cell signal here (Verizon) (that can be a challenge in this area). The neighborhood is located less than a mile from the edge of the WCU campus. We have stayed at several Airbnb’s in the Cullowhee/Sylva area- this is the best!! Highly recommend!!"

We wanted to respect the home as if it was ours. The bedding was simply elegant and comfortable! If I was to win the lotto, I would submit an offer on this place…lol!!
The place was well stocked, and simply a very relaxing environment. The running river was an added benefit as we sat on the screened in back porch. Outside activities were held at bay due to the weather, but having the heater on the porch was more than adequate for us to enjoy the vistas.
Sunday was a dry day and we made use of the fire pit to BBQ. The neighbors were very observant and friendly, so no security concerns whatsoever!
Randall & Dawn are great communicators and very quick to respond! This will be my go to retreat in the future getaways my family and I plan."

You get mountain views, tree views, and river views all in one!

We spent most of our time on the back patio relaxing and listening to the sounds of the river that was just a few feet below. The place even had a super cozy fireplace and a heated outdoor patio area where we spent countless hours.
The location was perfect with easy access to all the nearby grocery stores and restaurants. The place felt very warm and homey. It had everything you could want and more! The view was our favorite part! Sitting on the back patio drinking a glass of wine and watching the sun set on the Tuckasegee River was surreal. Just a feeling of total peace and being so close to nature.

The room is very private and check in process was smooth. It is right next to a beautiful creek as well, and the town of Sylva is right up the road which has a lot of great food/drink options."

Our dog enjoyed spending time on the veranda and walking the local fields behind the cottage.
The town of Sylva is about 10mins away with lots of shops and eateries.
Calvin gave very prompt replies to questions and provided lots of helpful information on areas to visit.
We all had a wonderful trip out to see Dry Falls near Franklin. Great experience of walking behind the waterfall. Then we travelled through the great heights of Blue Ridge Parkway to Waterford Knob. Magnificent views.
Overall, we had an amazing relaxing time and would definitely recommend.

Check-in was easy with a keypad and there is a convenient ramp for rolling luggage up to the house or if you are mobility challenged and unable to take steps up to the house. The house was very well stocked with all the comforts of home. Both beds were very comfortable memory foam beds, and it is very quiet at night. Everything was spotless. Our host was very responsive to any messages. It was a perfect stay, and I really can't recommend this spot enough. We'll definitely be back when visiting my brother in the area! Thank you, Calvin!"

We stayed for a few days while visiting our son at WCU. Communication with hosts was seamless and they are so accommodating. We were pleasantly surprised upon arriving the property. While the property was close to everything, it was also serene and peaceful. The house is immaculate (much appreciated!) and hosts thought of everything / anything one could need to make their stay enjoyable. Linens, towels & 'extras' graciously provided...high quality too. Decor and furnishings were perfect...mattresses super comfortable. We loved having our morning coffee on the farmer's porch, looking at the landscaping, rolling hills and watching wildlife.
We'll definitely return...hopefully soon! Thanks for such a wonderful stay!

A bit tricky to find after dark because the roads weren’t all that clear, but G—-😉 maps had no issue getting us to the driveway (it’s nestled between 3 other houses along a skinny driveway serving them all), but with the process of elimination we found it easily enough. Plenty of space, fantastic porch, lots of seating, and the beds are COMFORTABLE. This home will certainly be on our list when we come back to the area."

Stayed with a pet","We stayed at the cottage for 3 nights in January with our dog. It was very convenient for visiting our son at WCU. We love the cottage!! It is homey and cozy and very clean. It is quiet and relaxing. The size is perfect with 2 good sized bedrooms and 2 full baths. There is a large loft sitting area which was my favorite space. There are two televisions. The kitchen has everything you need and is clean and modern. The refrigerator has complimentary wine and chocolates and some staples you can use. Outdoors there is a yard for short dog walks and the adjacent road has little traffic. We did not use the fire pit or outdoor games, it was too cold - but would enjoy doing that next visit. There is a large deck with gates that lock to keep the dog confined. There is nice deck furniture to enjoy the beautiful view. FYI- there is no cell signal (Verizon), but the wifi works great. We look forward to staying here again. Thank you for sharing your cottage."

The extra amenities upon arrival were such a welcome surprise and very much appreciated as we didn't have to worry about stopping at a store for the next morning's breakfast. Coffee on the porch in the morning in the comfy chairs was peaceful.
The house was clean and the showers were even stocked with products for sensitive skin! The location was convenient to our family in Sylva. We were even able to enjoy the nearby recreation complex one day. The home was very comfortable and we enjoyed our stay."

It appears to be newly built with meticulous attention to details, including ubiquitous outdoor lighting (which is important if you are unfamiliar with how dark it gets in Cullowhee). Calvin was extremely timely in all communication and very easy to work with. He and his wife live next door and are accessible if needed, but unobtrusive otherwise. There is a concrete parking pad in the front of the house, but the fairly steep grade of gravel before the pad may require AWD on a day with wet ground."

Stayed a few nights","The location is only a few minutes away from WCU which was perfect as we were attending a WCU orientation. The host provided exceptional instructions and we found the home with no issues. It is a short, easy drive off the main highway with no no steep mountain roads. You would not need a 4x4 to get to this home so a great choice if you drive a smaller vehicle. The hosts have clearly made great efforts to restore this older home and it was absolutely charming as well as being fully functional. We didn't do much cooking but there seemed to be every kitchen tool needed to be able to make full meals, the beds were comfy with clean linens, and everything was spotless. Cell service is pretty much non existent at this location so be sure you have a plan for that. The Wifi however is excellent, even with 3 teens and streaming movies so we were fine with making wifi calls & messaging. I would not hesitate to book this home if we come back to visit our daughter while she attends WCU."

Stayed a few nights","Our stay at the Cottage in Cullowhee was amazing. The cottage was exactly as advertised, a 1940's farmhouse. It felt like stepping back into my Papa's old farmhouse when I was a child, down to the smells and the creaking floors. Although old, it was clean and had all the needed features of modern living. We spent most of our time away form the cabin exploring the nearby attractions... make sure your take a dip in the Tuckasegee river at the East Laporte park and check out the historic petroglyphs of Judaculla rock... but when we came back it was easy to relax. We watched 1 of the 100 DVDs provided one evening, and logged into HULU another. If you must stay connected, the Wifi was strong and a necessity as there is no cell service on the side of the mountain.
The beds were comfotable and clean.
Wildlife was abundant. Every night we saw deer(20+) and rabbits trekking from their hiding spots down to the creek.
This is now on our shortlist of places to stay in Cullowhee."

Stayed with kids","My family stayed while my daughter attended orientation at WCU. It is a charming cottage that is very convenient to the campus and all the area has to offer. We liked that it was an old, renovated farmhouse off the beaten path and had no issue with the intermittent internet & phone reception (this is to be expected in a mountain cottage). I can see why it is recommended to arrive in daylight. Check-in and out was a breeze. Our only criticism was that the beds were uncomfortable and needed maintenance. We notified our host, who was very responsive. We will have this place on our list to stay the next time we are in the area."

Stayed about a week","When we arrived we needed to sweep and vacuum the floors. Some of the dishes were dirty so we rewashed everything before using, including the coffee pot. There were spider webs and cob webs I swept down. The window glass was loose due to no glazing. The host brought us two screens to provide fresh air, otherwise we could not leave any window or door open. The beds were noisy enough to wake you up. I killed two cock roaches in the kitchen. There was an active carpenter ant colony in one of the kitchen windowsills. Somewhere in the house, we could not locate the source, flies were hatching out of something and for 2 days we killed 2-3 dozen flies each day, then the count was less then none. We bought a couple cans of bug spray and that helped. We bought painters tape and sealed a few openings where we could see outside. There was a gap on the bottom of the front door almost big enough for a mouse to get in. We stuffed towels where necessary.
We made the most of it and just imagined we were tent camping. Nice setting. Neighbors were quiet. Host was responsive about the window screens."

Stayed with kids","The biggest detractors from our stay being 5 Stars were the beds. The master bedroom mattress was very uncomfortable, and the base felt unstable. The mattress was extremely loud whenever we moved on the bed.
Our kids said their bed was uncomfortable and loud, too.
That being said, this house is a gem!!!
The hosts are very responsive, communication is great, the tap (well) water is out-of-this-world clean and wonderful! Hot water is amazing, location is very off-the-beaten-path (safe, quiet, no light pollution), great HVAC system, very clean and “one with nature.”
This would be a perfect fit for the right people - I think younger campers/outdoorsy types and/or folks who are looking to unplug and get away from urban stress.
The internet is functional, the speeds are nothing to write home about, but you’ll be just fine if you’re not a digital nomad who relies on fast internet.
There is no reliable cell phone service to speak of in/around the house. Keep that in mind."

We would happily stay there again. Don't miss Judaculla Rock which is nearby; it has more petroglyphs than any other boulder east of the Mississippi. There's great signs at the site discussing its history and the significance of the stone to the Cherokee.

The location is great for getting around to see the sights in the mountains in the area. Walking and hiking right around Anna's place yielded many adventures, from the seemingly fearless wildlife to the old cemetery (dates back to the 1800's) at the end of the road. Anna herself was great with directions and communication. Just be sure to arrive the first time before dark (as Anna suggests) - it is dark in the mountains at night. Great value! Have fun!"

It was so private yet only 20 minutes from almost anything you wanted to access like restaurants, hiking, waterfalls, swimming, and horseback riding, all of which we enjoyed. It’s very clean and the queen bed was very comfortable! The WiFi worked well, we had our phones and laptop all connected at once and got good service. We would recommend the cottage to anyone looking for a private and cozy getaway!"

Stayed with kids","The cottage location and charm have GREAT potential, but there was one serious (to me) issue which overcast our stay. I want to be fair, because there are attractive features regarding the property. Having grown up in a similar house of the same era as Sweet Leaf Cottage (but 90 miles north) I eagerly anticipated our stay. We especially looked forward to time relaxing on the porch and savoring the relatively quiet location, after daily visiting with lots of extended family in from everywhere at a nearby relative's house. Anna's instructions for arriving at the cottage and finding the key were perfectly accurate. Unfortunately, as soon as we entered, the odor of mold or mildew hit us (and I remembered the review comments I had read regarding the odor, which I hadn't seriously considered, thinking the odor had probably been taken care of) ... we decided to open up the whole house (three windows had been left open and had portable screens inserted, so the house wasn't completely closed up when we arrived) and let fresh air help the situation; the many ceiling fans helped with the airing. As we opened windows, we realized only three or four portable screens were available to prop into the windows, and there were no screen-doors. We opened far more windows than we had screens for, and the front and back doors. The fresh air was welcome, but we dreaded darkness when we expected to be overwhelmed by moths and other insects (but the insect invasion wasn't that bad later). Within a half-hour of our arrival I had a headache (and had spent some time on the porch, not all inside the house). Though the odor was diluted somewhat when the house was opened up more, when I woke the next morning, my throat was sore, (and my air was filtered through the CPAP machine I use while sleeping.) My husband isn't as sensitive to spores and didn't like the odor but it didn't affect him as it did me. Our eight-year-old granddaughter sat on the sofa, then said it smelled really bad and asked if she could sit on the floor. (She also mentioned several times feeling as though something was stuck in her throat, most of the time we were there). When she attempted to read in the little room off the dining room, she moved to the porch because, ""That little chair in there smells really bad."" We sent Anna a text asking if perhaps there were more window screens somewhere, not remembering there is NO mobile phone reception there. She did not get the text until we (and my phone) traveled to town, and she called us promptly after receiving it the next morning, but we had driven to the home we were visiting, also in a mobile phone non-coverage area, so didn't get her voice message until we were in town later that evening. We decided to just let our question about the screens go and didn't attempt to..."

The location was beautiful, although remote and no phone service or Wi-Fi. The home was clean, with much original charm. I did offer some suggestions to the host that included bug treatment to ensure bugs are not in the home (normal bug activity for the season) as well as some type of Wi-Fi signal availability in emergency you have to drive out of the area to find service. The host was very friendly and sent many communications and a very gracious responsive host. Directions provided from host ensured we did not get lost as the area is a bit remote and confusing to get into."

Stayed a few nights","Great location with beautiful, mountain views. Very remote so no cell phone service or internet network availability.
Unfortunately, we had a horrible experience with this property. The first thing that greeted us in the house was the ODOR. It can be best described as musty/mildewy smell that lingered our entire stay. Opening windows was not a good remedy for the smell because NONE of the windows had screens in them. There were 3 makeshift screens available, but this house needed to be fumigated with all windows open.
The bath towels and wash clothes were as rough as sandpaper. The bed linens were so worn they had holes in them.
The house was filthy! I have never had to pay a cleaning fee for an airbnb, but this place charged $35 and the place was dirty from top to bottom. I had to sweep the floors when we arrived. There is dust covering everything in the house (don't look at the window sills; they are nothing but filth). The shower had to be cleaned before anyone could use it. When I cleaned the shower, there was brown water running down the walls.
The bed and furniture was extremely uncomfortable. The double bed screeched loudly every time a person rolled over in it (good luck getting any sleep). The green couch had springs poking us in the back.
I do not recommend this property."

There are many thoughtful details such as snacks, coffee pods, sugar and creamers, a few sodas, a pitcher of water, bedside lighting, and a nice little sitting area. The hosts even messaged me to say rain was in the forecast so they left the carport open for me. They are very thoughtful and proactive with communication.

Apartment has modern furnishings and design with a cool vibe. Small kitchen was just enough for a few days including a full refrigerator, small kurig and stove top. Lots of nice extras included like k-cups, sugar & creamer, a few cans of soda and some snacks.
Although small designed with great use of space with a Recliner on 1 Side of the bed & a loveseat couch with raisable coffee table making it easy to work while staying.

Stayed with kids",This studio was a perfect place for our small family! It had just enough room for 3 of us. It was like our own little hotel room. We had no problems getting in and had our own little personal parking spot under the carport. The owners were very nice and checked on us to make sure everything was to our liking. It was right around the corner from where I had to work so it was a perfect location for us. The bed was very comfortable and we loved the design of the bathroom. It's a perfect place if you just need a nice place to sleep at night and then explore the area all day. The price was great! A hotel would have definitely cost more. The privacy we had was great! Thanks so much!

The location is wonderful as well—in the pretty hills overlooking Western Carolina University, which is very easy to get to. The hosts are lovely and and checked to be sure I had everything I needed (though there was not another thing I could think of needing; it was all already there). I am looking forward to staying there again."

From the information and video, we knew how everything worked before going. Being a big basketball fan I checked to make sure we would be able to watch the final four Saturday game and our host let me that we would not miss it and where to find it on the television. We had excellent communications from our host. I would highly recommend staying with them in Cullowhee!!!"

Provide soda and snacks, etc. Russ even hand wrote detailed instructions for the tv so that we could easily find the winning game of the World Series which was very important to my husband. Every detail of this place is well thought out and geared towards making your stay comfortable and enjoyable. Hope we can stay there every visit we make to Cullowhee."

From relaxing music playing on the tv when we arrived to snacks / drinks available in the kitchen to a basket of essentials in the bathroom in case we forgot something, the hosts made sure that we were well cared for. We met Don after we arrived. He was super friendly and seemed interested to know about us and find out how he could assist with anything we needed. He even gave us a parting gift as a thank you and a way to share their talents with us. The property is shaded and peaceful and we enjoyed rocking in the chairs outside in the evenings. And, the bed was so very comfortable! I can’t say enough about how much we enjoyed our stay and how fortunate we are to have stumbled upon it. This is certainly a place we will stay again when we are in the area. Thank you doesn’t seem like enough to express our sincere gratitude to Don and Renee."

Stayed with kids","Our stay at Don and Renie's ""Studio Apartment with Kitchen"" for a Softball Camp at Western Carolina University was simply outstanding. Their graciousness in accommodating our late 11 PM check-in was greatly appreciated. The apartment felt like a home away from home, with thoughtful amenities and a fully-equipped kitchen that made our stay convenient and comfortable. We were pleasantly surprised by the delicious local honey they provided. Don and Renie's warm hospitality truly made our stay memorable. Highly recommended!"

Stayed one night","I have honestly never had a better experience with a short term rental. Don and Renie introduced themselves immediately via text, gave us all of the information about the apartment and surrounding area, and just made us feel incredibly welcome. We found the apartment to be clean, well appointed, and in a perfect area. The thoughtfulness that went in to every little detail was unmatched...they provided a selection of snacks and drinks and toiletries that you might've left at home, as well as plenty of resources about the area. The furniture and decor were nice, and the bed was actually very comfortable. We honestly had so much fun just looking around the apartment, discovering all of the special touches. Although we checked in late and spent a very short time there, we were able to meet Don in the morning. Meeting a host in person was a first for us, but I'm so glad we did. He was such a nice person, and genuinely cared to know how our stay went. We'll definitely be back. Thank you!"

Don went above and beyond to make sure everything would work out and even widened the ramp prior to our arrival. One of us became ill during the stay and he brought us take-out. I've never felt so safe and cared for by a host and I've been doing this for a while now! Beautiful apartment, SO clean with literally ANYTHING you need. Don and Renie have thought of it ALL. You will really be at HOME! That shower...OMG!!! We can't wait to go back!"

They have been in the area a long time and know it well. What made it special was all the thought they put into making sure their guests had everything they needed. The studio was wonderful. Very nicely furnished, lots of room to relax, great deck for reading and relaxing, unbelievable shower, everything needed to cook and enjoy a meal. Next time we go back we plan on spending more time relaxing there.
It was our first time in the Sylva area. We enjoyed hiking, fishing and exploring the town. Will certainly go back soon."

Don was the best host a person can be. He was approachable, very reachable and very concerned for our well-being and stay in his place. On the inside of the home Don and Renie had everything that was needed. It was like we were at home. The furnishings were astonishing, the place was very clean. Don even provided drinks, water, coffee, and other items to eat at no cost. Don's place was the best Airbnb we ever stayed in.

Don was very forthcoming with recommendations to explore the amazing mountains and local restaurants. His referral of Peter’s Pancakes and Waffles did not disappoint. 😊 and we walked off our breakfast nearby at the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The amenities that Don and Renie provide are by far the best that I’ve experienced at an Airbnb. If there are any toiletries that you forgot, you’ll find it in a lovely ceramic bowl in the most beautiful bathroom with a spectacular steam shower that has 3 shower heads. The fridge was filled with cold drinks, and the kitchen provides an endless supply of coffee, tea, hot chocolate and salty snacks - there’s also a bowl of assorted candy in the living room area. This lovely studio has everything that you need, I highly recommend staying here."

They provide all the amenities - snacks and drinks, a well stocked tea and coffee bar area, frozen pizzas for those late night hunger pangs, and any toiletries you may have left behind. The apartment also boasts multiple couches, a comfortable reclining bed, dish network and board games. Cleanliness is an important factor when staying anywhere and Don and Renie take pride in providing a clean comfortable environment. I HIGHLY recommend a stay at their studio apartment when visiting Cullowhee. You will not be disappointed! I will definitely be back!"

Stayed a few nights",Don and Renie’s place is amazing both inside and out! Outside you can enjoy the sights and sounds of nature with plenty of bird calls and out back they even have bee boxes. Inside you can enjoy a nice aesthetically pleasing and clean environment. Complementary snacks and drinks were provided for those we wanted a little something extra. There is even a large rain shower with plants! Very relaxing!

Stayed a few nights","Don and Renie are wonderful hosts. Their communication was always prompt and thorough. The apartment was clean, well stocked, and oh so welcoming. They LOVE to please their guests by not only providing a wonderfully comfortable place to stay (That bed is amazing!), but also by the additional welcoming touches in the apartment - like the filled-to-the-brim candy bowl (Hurray for chocolate!), the well stocked coffee bar, and the stash of tasty goodies in the fridge & freezer.
One of the first words that comes to my mind about this apartment is ""peaceful."" What a quiet and cozy retreat, surrounded by forest and the song of the wood thrush!! It was the perfect ""home base"" for exploring the local area and then returning for a restful night on the mountain.
We very much enjoyed our stay and look forward to coming again! Thank you Don & Renie!!"

We have been staying at Airbnb rentals for years and most of them have been lovely but Don and Renie’s place is in a class by itself. They are wonderful hosts and make you feel as if you are cherished friends rather than strangers.
The bed was so comfortable and the apartment was very well appointed with a coffee bar and a stocked refrigerator with snacks!
It was the perfect getaway and we can’t wait to visit again!"

The apt is clean with plenty of space and has lots of nice added touches to make your stay more enjoyable. They are next door if needed, but they don't want to intrude on your time away. Always asking what they can do to make our stay more enjoyable. It's easy to find at the end of the road. You might get a little glimpse of some wildlife while you're there. We saw turkeys wandering by a couple of nights. Off the beaten path but close enough to anywhere you want to go. We look forward to coming back again later in the year."

The beds were super comfortable, exceptional linens, great kitchen and a large walk in shower. There's a wonderful view of WCU from the back yard as well. We've stayed in other rentals in the area and Don and Renie's place was by far so much better as the apartment was super clean, cozy, comfortable and had all the extras that the other places simply did not have. We will definitely return for future stays!"

One of our favorite features was the giant tile shower. We will definitely be back here for our next trip to Sylva. Would recommend staying here to anyone. I’d give them a 10 out of 5 if I could.

Everything in the apartment is extremely well-thought out and well-finished, from the spa shower room to the modern kitchen! When I arrived everything was beautifully setup, with lots of amenities & nice touches throughout the apartment that really made me feel welcome there. This was my first time in Western Carolina and I can truly say this apartment is in a great location, a relatively close drive to big attractions like the Great Smokies & Blue Ridge Parkway, as well as many other lesser known parks and not too far from stores/restaurants in Sylva. Don & Renie were also able to offer up some great recommendations on hiking areas and continually went out of there way to make sure I was as comfortable as possible during my stay!
This was my first time traveling since Covid started, and I also felt that Don & Renie did a great job sanitizing the apartment as well as minimizing human interaction to social distance-- I felt very safe my entire time!
An all-around amazing experience!"

Stayed a few nights","I was hesitant about renting a studio apartment thinking it would be small and crowded. As it turned out it is quite spacious and comfortable. It is well stocked with necessities and ""treats"" too The Queen bed is perfect and the duvet, sleep inducing We loved the large, walk-in stone tiled shower. There are plenty of towels, a washer and dryer, dishwasher, large refrigerator, microwave, and gas cooktop. It is hard to think of anything that is needed and not provided. But if I had to come up with something, it would be that there isn't a lot of storage space for groceries.And if you wanted to bake a cake, you would be out of luck as there isn't an oven. However, I have a feeling that Renie would happily supply her own oven for the occasion if asked. You can expect the hosts, Renie and Don, to be welcoming and eager for you to have a great stay ."

From the time we booked our stay to the time we got home, these two made a fabulous effort to make our trip wonderful. We received very specific and detailed directions that brought us right to our stay along with details about the rest of the stay. The hosts were also quick to respond to any additional questions that arose for us. When we met them, they gave us lots of tips about places to visit in the area. With all this in mind, the hosts were also very careful about giving us as much privacy as we liked. It is certainly evident how much effort these two put into making this a wonderful place for someone to stay. We could not believe how thoughtful they had been with just the little things. We would definitely love to stay here again, and we would recommend this place to anyone!"

Don and Renie’s apartment atop Catamount Gap was certainly no exception to that. But what really set Don and Renie apart from the others was the warmth of their hospitality and their kindness. They responded graciously and promptly to every inquiry. They told me multiple times that I should let them know if I needed anything at anytime. I’m honestly not sure what I could have needed because their apartment provided everything from the plush adjustable bed, to the spectacularly beautiful bathroom to the breathtaking mountaintop scenery. Don and Renie are quite simply two kind, gracious human beings who have a beautiful, well cared for Airbnb property. Visit their beautiful mountain home. You will not be disappointed!"

Stayed a few nights","My stay at Don and Renie's studio apartment was wonderful in every way. As hosts, Don and Renie go above and beyond to anticipate any needs their guests might have. If there's something they haven't thought of, they want their guests to let them know. Since the apartment is attached to their house but with distinctly separate entrances, they are available but very respectful of your privacy. As you walk in through the sliding glass doors, the apartment is cozy and inviting. The huge walk-in shower was amazing after a day of hiking, and the abundance of soft towels was great. The bed was very comfortable with plenty of pillows and cozy comforters to promote a restful night's sleep. The extra touches showed Don and Renie's thoughtfulness: plenty of brochures and maps of the area's attractions, snacks and drinks, a basket of toiletry items if you forgot something, cleaning supplies, and a first aid kit, to name a few. The gas stove and microwave/oven combo made cooking meals very easy. Instruction books for all of the appliances are in the cabinets. The apartment has a TV and WiFi (although I didn't use either during my stay). My phone service is Verizon, and I had good connection even though the location is in the mountains. If you need to do some laundry, there's a stacked washer and dryer with detergent provided in the closet.
On a very personal note, I had scheduled this trip almost last-minute for a quick, weekend getaway. Just hours after my reservation was confirmed, my extended family experienced tragedy. Not knowing yet when funeral arrangements would be, I contacted Don and Renie to let them know that my plans might suddenly change and why. They were very gracious and accommodating for those circumstances. The funeral was delayed, and I kept my reservation knowing that I needed the quiet space to deal with my own emotions. It was a healing place to do that. The peacefulness of sitting on the porch in early morning as I listened to the songs of birds and watched squirrels scamper up and down the trees and wild turkeys strut down the driveway was comforting to my heart.
Don and Renie are very thoughtful and gracious hosts who have provided a tasteful apartment where their guests can relax and be refreshed."

Bathroom and shower were unique, it has 3 showers and they provided extra bath towels, shampoo, conditioner and more.

This was our first AirBnb experience and it was way better than we ever expected. Don and Renie are very friendly and made us feel right at home. They are very informative about the area and are more than happy to answer any questions you may have. We were visiting for WCU’s open house and the location was perfect. It is less than 10 minutes from the university. There are also plenty of other sites to see around the area. Especially if you enjoy the outdoors and hiking. We decided to hike the High Falls Trail during our visit and it was absolutely gorgeous. It was only about a 20-30 minute drive from the apartment. I would definitely recommend Don and Renie’s AirBnb apartment to anyone visiting the area. You will not find more gracious hosts any where else. We will definitely be staying there again!
