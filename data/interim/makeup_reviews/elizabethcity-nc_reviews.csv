Stayed a few nights","This place is absolutely wonderful! It was everything we wanted and then some. I completely fell in love with the place, it was so clean, decorated so cute, very comfortable, felt very safe, walkable to restaurants and coffee shop, and very affordable! We were visiting for our son’s US Coast Guard A School graduation, so we LOVED all of the coast guard pictures and decorations! We arrived super late after a long day of travel, we were so thankful for all of the snacks they had left for us! And the coffee shop gift card was a very nice gesture. I will definitely be recommending this cute place to other fellow USCG parents. Would stay here again in a heart beat! Highly recommended!"

Stayed a few nights","This place was absolutely perfect and even better than the photos and description make it seem. Communication with Donnie wasn’t required but it was obvious that communication and availability to the guest were clearly at the top of Donnie’s list of importance. I was here for a family reunion and if I ever need to come back, this is number one in my search"

I was able to get to restaurants and coffee shops within walking distance while my car was in the shop. Just a few blocks from everything downtown Elizabeth City has to offer. Hosts were quick to respond. I would recommend this spot to anyone!

Note; We didn’t follow directions so well getting there and Donnie responded immediately when we called and even stood outside to help us get parked. Donnie had sent us instructions with photos that were clear. Hence why I say we didn’t follow them well. 😊"

Stayed a few nights","This was my second time staying with Donnie. We previously stayed in the Library room, and this stay was in the Douglas Munro Suite. It was very spacious. The bed was extremely comfortable with our son sleeping on the pull out bed. He said that it was comfortable as well. I love the historic neighborhood and that there are so many great restaurants within walking distance. We haven't taken advantage of all the extra amenities that are provided, but how nice is it that they are there?! With our son now attending college in Elizabeth City we plan to stay with Donnie provided he has rooms available when we plan to visit. I highly recommend any of his listings."

It was spacious, well apportioned and furnished in a way that didn’t make it feel crowded. It had a bathtub, which NEVER happens.
We visited the man cave (just to see it). It was very nice. We were there for a short while, so we didn’t get to visit the gym.
We parked on the street and our car was safe and undisturbed overnight. We walked to the waterfront and felt completely safe.
Our daughter will be a student at a nearby college and we will definitely be back!!"

The room looked just like the pictures and included lots of space for us to spread out, and they generously provided snacks as well as access to a gym and a washer and dryer if needed. The bed was very comfortable, the kitchen was modern, and parking was conveniently located in front of the courtyard entrance. Additionally, the location was perfect--centrally located and charming--and the price was beyond reasonable.
We wish we could have stayed longer and will definitely book again the next time we visit Elizabeth City!

Lovely space, mattress & linens best I have slept on in a while (& recently stayed at a Ritz Carleton) - I literally looked to see what brand the mattress & linens were before leaving. Nice touches like USB plug in lamps at bedside for electronics. Quiet. Close parking. Hairdryer was strong enough to quickly dry my very thick long hair. Kitchen was equipped nicely & had my HelloFresh box arrived on time would have easily allowed me to cook everything in it.
Things I didn't use b/c this was a work trip but would be fantastic for a leisure trip - furnished patio, bikes, pool table. Thank you."

It felt private. Donnie had left us snacks, water and a gift card for coffee down the street ( which was not super great!). But it was a thoughtful gesture. Loved being able to catch up with laundry! Easy walk to downtown where we had lots of reasonable, yummy choices for dinner!"

The kids enjoyed the wonderful snacks that were left and thank God for the water too! Very close to many places to eat and have a drink. Just all around a great stay. Will be planning to stay here again on another visit to the area.

Stayed a few nights","Jonathan and Ivy are terrific hosts! They showed right away that they would be available to assist with any issues when we had difficulty with the electronic door lock. Jonathan arrived within minutes. :)
Anchors Away is a lovely historic house. It has a gracious front porch, a fenced yard with picnic table and grill, and is in a walkable historic neighborhood. The kitchen has been nicely remodeled with new appliances and all the necessary cookware and dinnerware. The bathrooms have a vintage look but the plumbing is definitely modern — plenty of hot water and no rattling pipes. All of the furnishings are comfortable. The entire house was nicely decorated, tidy, and clean.
Elizabeth City is a cute small city with a modest waterfront park, a boardwalk along a creek, and possibly the most diverse collection of historic architecture I’ve ever seen in a small city. There are numerous walking tours to enjoy, and plenty of restaurants and a great wine bar to stop at along the way."

Stayed a few nights","Everything looked good and we were happy with our stay. Only two thing stood out to us at checkin, which was the downstairs bathroom had a door accessible to the outside, which the bottom lock didn't work, but they had a deadbolt that did and a old leak in the first bedroom. None of that was a real issue for us. Overall, we were satisfied with our stay. I would just suggest you record your checkin and checkout and be sure to get the ceiling. I made that statement due to a message I received after checkout from the co-host Jonathan. He reported there was some damage ""quite a bit of stains and broken ceiling fan globe,"" and he planned to request $50 to cover the globe and extra cleaning. I inquired about proof of damages because I was unaware of damages. We didn't use any of the three ceiling fans due to the weather, and I didn't know about stains. I requested proof, and he stated he would send proof in the morning when he requested the $50. It's has been 14 days, and still nothing."

Stayed a few nights","As a local, this is the cheapest “entire home” experience you will find in Elizabeth City for 6 people. I’ll add it to my list of top 3 Airbnb stays in the area after Loft Gardens, and the Espy Haus.
The home was perfect to host my family that were coming from out of town, as I live down the street but couldn’t accommodate more people.
My family liked how close they were to the river (5 min walk) to catch the sunrise, downtown (10 min walk) for restaurants and bars, and the OBX (1 hr drive) to see the best part of visiting Elizabeth City.
If I’m looking for extra space in the future, I’ll definitely book this Airbnb again."

Stayed about a week","We (6 people) spent a week in Elizabeth City (October)--as a home base for things in the area. We arrived Saturday evening, later than planned but everything was easy. The keycode entry pad was well illuminated, and the instructions from Ivy easy to follow. Parking right infront of the house was always easy. When we got inside we were all pleasantly surprised. Very clean, the pictures on the website matched what we found--everything tidy and clean with lots of space. The walls (a very nice green) harmonized well with the hard wood floors. And the kitchen / eating area...a LOT of space...with a large marble cooking island in the middle, gas stove, well stocked kitchen (i.e. cooking utensils, pots and pans and baking dishes, coffee maker, etc. although two pans were on their last legs)--definitely a great space (and large table) for people who like to cook and sit together at meals. Everything else in the house was...clean and tidy, a big TV in most every room, towels, a great place."

Stayed with kids","We enjoyed our stay at Anchors Away! All of the little touches showed just how much our hosts cared- we especially liked finding treasures in the bunk room for our toddler to play with (his favorites were the glitter wand and a dinosaur figure).
Traveling with a young child, it was important to us to find a place with a tub and laundry facilities. Unfortunately, those were the two things that ended up being a cause for concern for us: The upstairs shower/tub had a good deal of mold and the dryer was on the fritz. I hate to make mention of these things, but they absolutely affected the quality of our stay."

We only stayed for an evening as we were traveling through, but a lot of info was provided on the town - seems like a fun place and not far from some great coastal adventures. The hosts were super responsive, not that we needed anything. Comfy beds and quality linens and towels. We had a full house and while we all fit it might be a bit tight for a longer stay. Friends with nicer cars commented on the street only parking, but the neighborhood seems fine despite the area you drive through to get there. The houses are very close together so mind the blinds when changing! I would stay again - we even considered asking for an extra day since we were so tired and so close to the rover and beaches with wild horses!"

Elizabeth City is nice and quiet, though we weren't too used to navigating around town, but that's part of the adventure when we visit new places. The beds were very comfortable and all 6 six of us slept well in a cozy and well ventilated house. Jonathan's spouse, Melissa was able to take care of our wifi issue swiftly, which was very much appreciated because the younger children wouldn't let up about needing wifi access as soon as we stepped foot into the house. She was also so kind to sweep the water that had collected on the front porch after the rain, shortly upon our arrival. Thank you, Melissa! Overall, pleasant experience and we would definitely recommend ""Anchors Away"" for your stay in NC!! :)"

We had 6 adults in our party and we all took showers In the morning. There was plenty of hot water. The beds were very comfortable and the two bigger rooms had ceiling fans. The smaller room (which consisted of a single bed and bunk beds) had a floor fan. The neighborhood was very quiet.
Our hosts had bottled waters for us in the refrigerator. There was also a tea and coffee station. The kitchen was essentially stocked. We chose to have dinner out the evening we stayed. There were several places to choose from. Ivy & Johnathan have provided recommendations in their welcome binder. Speaking of the hosts, communication was very, very timely."

They were there promptly, as she had assured they would be, and got everything ready to enjoy but unfortunately the days we were there the weather did not allow us to enjoy it. Back yard was so inviting and private. We would definitely use this location again. Many Thanks to Maureen for her prompt replies and instructions on entering and exiting the house and for hosting us at such a short notice since our original booking cancelled our reservation without any reason.

We were in the area to visit some family and the Airbnb was in the perfect location and within close vicinity to everything we wanted to do. The house was super clean and we really enjoyed the sun room. This was a great weekend getaway. We also loved that we were able to bring our four legged friends. The only thing we were a little disappointed in was the fenced in backyard. The very back part of the fence along the tree line/swamp had started falling down. We did not feel comfortable leaving our dogs in the backyard without full supervision just because we were afraid they would possibly escape where the fence has started to fall in the back part along the tree line. If you have really small dogs, this may not be a concern for you. We were still able to let our dogs roam freely in the backyard and play fetch, we just didn’t fully trust the fence security along the backstretch."

Stayed a few nights","Every thing was really good. Great place for a dog. The house is on a dead end street which makes for a good place to walk a dog. I only have one complaint and one suggestion for improvement. There is a broken dresser in the master bedroom. Not a big deal because 4 of the drawers still work. The picture in the living room with a naked man and 2 naked women in it are a real problem for most people my age, Christians, or families with young children. You might want to change the picture to something that would be more appropriate for everybody's taste. Overall a good stay."

For the price of a mid-level hotel in most cities, this was a bargain and great place to call home for a few days. I can only imagine what it would be like in warmer weather."

Stayed one night","This is a difficult review to write since Alice tried to accommodate us, and we didn't really get a chance to talk with her as some of her guests seem to have. I selected her place based on the availability of a hot tub at a waterfront location, so it was a big disappointment that it was not working. We were not notified of that in advance, or I would have asked to cancel. Alice was apologetic when she heard the hot tub was important to us, and when asked, she did provide a partial refund of the nightly cost.
Our 1st floor unit was comfortable, but it felt more like visiting mom's (off-white reclining sofas with drink holders, figurines in cabinets, etc.). The kitchen is well supplied: there's even Christmas china. The 2nd floor unit was also rented, and we heard them...
Unfortunately, the fees associated with this Airbnb are very high, and given the pricing, we expected more. All in all, we could have stayed somewhere much nicer for less than the total cost, even after the refund."

We came back because we love this area, we love the views from the dock and the apartment. We know we can count on Alice to have everything ready for when we arrive. It feels like home to us which is really more than anyone can ask for when you travel. It's a very relaxing atmosphere to be able to just soak up some sun or do some fishing right off the dock. I would go walking the neighborhood in the mornings while my husband did his fishing. We got to enjoy the 4th of July celebrations and the fireworks. We enjoy trying out all the local places to eat and have some cocktails. We highly recommend this location. We can't wait to come back next year!"

Stayed a few nights","My son and I LOVED this place! Bird watching with the sunrise. Super super clean. Well stocked kitchen. Plenty of comfortable seating, lamps, tables, pillows, linens... Everything! Very quiet, even with other units occupied.
Alice lives next door and is welcoming, happy to help, is willing to share stories and history with you, but also gave us all the privacy we could hope for.
Highly highly recommend!
The only word of caution I might have is, the place is literally right on the water, and there is no railing around to prevent a young child from going over the edge. So, if you have young ones, you'll need to pay close attention. We loved this though, as we were able to sit on the edge and dangle our feet."

Stayed one night","The location of this place is absolutely fantastic! The house and its decks are right on the river with views of osprey, swallows, and other birds - we also saw dolphins. Hearing the waves against the docks was a real treat and so relaxing.
Especially enjoyed the swinging bench while watching sunset over the water.
Downtown Elizabeth City is within a 15 minute walk.
Alice gave attention to provide plenty of extra items like towels, blankets, fully stocked kitchen including blender, crockpot, etc.
A little on the expensive side but a great and relaxing place to stay!"

Stayed a few nights","We had such a wonderful time at Alice’s waterfront studio. It was just perfect for our needs. We postponed my birthday trip because of weather, and I’m so glad it worked out that I could have my belated retreat here.
We spent quite a bit of time on the dock fishing, and we caught our fill of catfish - I even pulled out a 5lb at night! And, it was about an hour away from VAB for a little day trip. It’s also walking distance from several restaurants in town, convenient for walking back from having margaritas at Big Boss Burritos.
Everything was as described, but the views are even more breathtaking in person. Now we understand why Elisabeth City is known as the Harbor of Hospitality! We’ll be back!!"

- WIFI - works well, I did work from the place for two days. Really strong connection
- Bed- on the firm side, really large and comfortable. all cotton sheets and blankets
- Bathroom- decent pressure, had soap, tissues and 100% cotton towels. Good size shower - works for tall people
- the space is larger than it seems in the pics and even though it's a studio the kitchen is separate from the bed and living room. Beautiful finishes and really a comfortable place. I wish we had more time there!
- full kitchen - basic utensils and a few pots and pans
-the view- THE VIEW! It's breathtaking. Alice really does an amazing job keeping this place pristine - we didn't have issues with spiders or bugs outside, it was comfortable, private and you feel like you are in the country when you are in the middle of everything. Small town but perfect place to getaway and relax."

It felt as if we were home with many smaller attention to detail that I was not expecting. Again, it was our first stay but the amount of toiletries provided, clean towels, extra sheets and even an extra mattress. If we visit that area again, I would definitely stay again. we had friends who stayed in a hotel near by and after hearing some issues they were having, I'm so glad we opted in for this cottage!"

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I just left Jasper's cottage on October 1st, 2023, after staying 2 nights. I must say, we had an enjoyable and peaceful stay. Jasper provided clear instructions on how to work the keyless lock to get into the home. Once we took our time to press the numbers on the keyless entry, we were able to get in and out with no problems. The kitchen is very spacious and Jasper had everything you needed from cleaning supplies to shampoo and any other amenities to make the stay comfortable. There is not a TV in the bedrooms which i thoughtvwas going to be a problem for me as I am used to watching TV to go to sleep, but believe it or not I was able to sleep like a baby. The bed was so comfortable as it was very soft and easy to rest on. The second bedroom did not have a closet but that was okay as the master bedroom has a huge closet space for both bedrooms. The stay was wonderful and less than 2 minutes to get into the city area of Elizabeth City."

The backyard is large and perfect area for young children to run and play. The kitchen is adequately stocked with cookware, gadgets, dinnerware and a beautiful large dining table.
The location is ideal if you love hanging in the outer banks during the day and want to escape the hustle and bustle of beach crowd at night. There are quite a few dining and drinking options nearby that are family friendly. I wouldn’t hesitate to stay in this quaint home again if I find myself in this area in the future!"

The kitchen/living room area is upstairs which helped give the open bedroom a feeling of quiet privacy, and the bed was so comfortable! The kitchen is an absolute dream… full oven/range, full refrigerator, well stocked pantry, a toaster and a microwave, and don’t even get me started on how in love I am with the coffee maker. It truly has everything you could need and more. Traveling as folks with dietary restrictions is often challenging, especially in smaller towns, so it was really nice to be able to prepare meals. There are shops, breweries, restaurants, and coffee shops all within a short walk of the apartment. We felt very safe coming and going regardless of time of day. Street parking was easy to find and free of charge. Would absolutely stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","We've always wanted to stay on a houseboat, and I'm so glad our first houseboat experience was here! Mechelle was so friendly and helpful from the minute we booked the reservation. Her recommendations are on point. We loved walking to the local Farmer's Market on Saturday morning, the bookstore, The Kraken Coffeehouse, and other little shops. We even made a pit stop at the Moyock Market on the way home. Even though downtown Elizabeth City is just steps away, the houseboat felt very private and peaceful. Everything was super clean, bed & furniture were so comfortable, and we appreciated all the amenities. Although we didn't cook, it was nice having a full fridge and coffee supplies. We enjoyed reading and sipping our morning coffee on the Adirondack chairs on the roof! Highly recommend! We'd can't wait to visit again the next time our schedules allow us to slip away to enjoy a kiddo-free weekend!"

She provided everything we needed to have a comfortable stay and went above and beyond by providing snacks and a bottle of wine upon arrival. Mechelle was incredibly communicative and responded immediately when we needed anything. She even invited us to join her on her own boat for a visit to the swimming hole. Elizabeth City was so charming and had just the right amount of activities (great live music right next door on Saturday) for our two night stay. Can’t recommend Mechelle’s boat enough!

Stayed a few nights","Even though it was a colder and rainier weekend than would be ideal for a houseboat stay, we still had a great time. Mechelle is very communicative and accommodating. The parking situation on the weekend was a breeze (the lot next to the boats wasn’t too hard to find), even at night. Also FYI there’s a bit of a gap (as normal) stepping onto the boat, so if you were mobility challenged this might be a consideration (also I can see this leading to some interesting outcomes if you were to have a few too many at one of the nearby bars or restaurants haha), but that wasn’t a big deal (again, as is pretty normal with boats).
The boat itself was lovely. Very clean and well kept, nice places to sit in the common area, a perfectly usable (if a bit small) kitchen area, and two bedrooms (one of which is a walkthrough where the bathroom is located) with quite comfortable beds. There are portable and over-head heating units, so even though it was chilly outside, we were perfectly fine.
Finally, the best part are the two patios: the front and the top of the boat. (There’s also an outside area at the back of the boat, but not really a place to sit- it mostly serves as the place where the ladder is to the top patio). Both very lovely and so pleasant to sit outside with coffee or wine and read or think or work or chat.
Would definitely recommend!"

She welcomed us when we arrived and showed us around the house boat, and surprised us with a bottle of wine on the counter! The bed and pillows were super comfy and we slept really well both nights.
She lent us two kayaks which we enjoyed both days, and even allows us to stay as long as we wanted on our check out day, since it was supposed to rain all Saturday (but lucky for us it didn’t!).

Stayed a few nights","We couldn’t speak more highly about Mechelle and her houseboat, “Island Time”!  
We booked our stay as a getaway from the city for my girlfriend’s birthday and couldn’t have made a better choice. The “Island Time” has an amazing vibe, and is incredible comfortable and cozy. The entire houseboat was spotless, and if there is something you find yourself needing on your trip, Mechelle has found a place for it in the houseboat. The bed linens and towels were top notch and we slept great each night. The houseboat was in a great location, lots of action on the water and steps away from town center. We loved having a morning coffee on the porch and a glass of wine at sunset on the roof. But what truly made our stay here was our amazing host! Mechelle is so incredibly kind, generous, and thoughtful. She is the true embodiment of southern hospitality and we still can’t stop talking about how AMAZING she is! 10 out of 10 would recommend to a friend, and to you, to stay here, you won’t regret it!"

We will definitely be returning! Don’t hesitate to book your stay on Island Time. You won’t regret it!"

Stayed a few nights","If you are reading this review to decide whether or not to book ""Island Time"" for your next get-away, DO IT!!! This place is amazing in every way and is perfect for a romantic couples trip or even a solo or girls trip to seek solace from the hustle and bustle of real life. Island Time offers river front living on the cutest house boat you can imagine. The host has thought of absolutely everything to make you feel comfortable and at home on her boat. Everything is sparkling clean and the bed linens and towels are super high quality and just beautiful...not to mention the beautiful splashes of beach color everywhere you turn. The interior looks like something out of a magazine but still has that cozy/comfortable feel.
The activities are endless if you can't sit still like me. You can kayak, rent SUPs, swim, bike, stroll through downtown Elizabeth City and look at the beautiful historic homes, or walk to a great brewery or several great restaurants. If you are the sitting and relaxing type, you can sit on the top deck and sip coffee or wine for hours and enjoy the beautiful river views and sunsets.
What really makes this place stand out (outside of it's super cute and clean interior, great near-by attractions and reasonable price) is the host. I have stayed in many, many airbnbs and have had many great experiences, but this host wins the award for hospitality. She is AWESOME in every way. We will be going back soon and often."

She had many thoughtful touches throughout the boat to make our stay comfortable.

She was a wonderful host and we will be definitely be back!

Stayed a few nights","We had a last minute trip to Elizabeth City, NC and found them gem for our weekend getaway. What could be better than staying on a house boat?! Nothing! Well, maybe drinking a well-deserved glass of wine on the decks while watching the sun set! The boat is great for a couple but has plenty of room for several more, maybe a girl’s weekend??? The location is an easy walk to a variety of restaurants and bars or take a stroll through town. Did I mention, you can put in for kayaking right by the boat and super safe to keep your kayaks on the dock. The accommodations were great We spent the majority of our time on the decks but the inside was every bit as comfy , well-appointed, even down to the Keurig for you coffee drinkers, and welcoming. Now let’s talk hosts, Mechelle is the best! She is welcoming, friendly, responsive, and a great resource for tips about the area. We really could not have found a better weekend getaway!"

Stayed a few nights","What a great experience. We’ve never stayed on a houseboat and it was more than expected. The front porch area was our main hang out space because it was so comfortable and the weather was perfect.
This is not a cruise ship but more a tiny house experience. But we cooked, ate, slept well, so everything you need is there. We walked to restaurants and even a local theater group was having a play. Also there is a drop in art studio to get creative. And a science fun place for kiddos. We had our teenagers with us and no wifi was actually a nice break. Totally worth it!"

My husband and I highly recommend this wonderful home to any looking for a nice place to relax and enjoy their vacation.

Stayed with a pet","Tammy was super responsive and helpful. All instructions for the home were in great detail on the app but also framed in the home - but not in an abrasive manner. It was super convenient when the group we were with was packing up, I didn’t get a million questions on what we needed to do!
The house had plenty of TP which in the past getting homes on Airbnb has been an issue. Tammy even included extra toothpaste and and toothbrush packets and shampoo and conditioner which came in handy when one of the guests had their bags lost in travel.
The kitchen also has everything you need. We did not have an issue with lack of dishes - which happens sometimes.
We had three vehicles, one compact car, Truck, and XL Ford a transit van and we all fit perfectly in the driveway. I’d even say there is room for an additional compact car to squeeze in after that.
Overall the home is super clean, convenient, and comfortable. Many naps were taken on the comfy couch."

What we got was a beautiful, spotless home that exuded peacefulness. This is an older home that has been upgraded without losing any of its original charm. It was equipped with everything we needed for our two-week stay. The furniture was comfortable and relaxing, and the decor was spot-on. It seemed as if every day we discovered something new that was so impressive. Tammy got the big picture right, but she also paid close attention to the little details that make a surprising difference. We did not want to leave!"

Group trip","WOW! WOW! WOW! What a wonderful place in a wonderful location with a wonderful host. The pictures do not do the Loft Gardens any justice. When we arrived we were given a tour and all the details we needed for our stay. This location is ideal for all ages honestly! There is a little of everything to do near the area. I didn't want to leave the house because of how beautiful and spacious it is in there. It's very open and airy but cozy at the same time. There is a lot of art and knick knacks to look at as well as books that might peak your interest. The furniture is a really good mixture of modern/sheek/antique. We stayed in the Master Bedroom and I fell in LOVE with the bathroom because of the sky light, greenery and all the other elements. I could go on and on about this home so I will end with this, We had a large family group staying with us and there were enoughs beds and rooms for everyone. There were plenty sheets, towels, blankets etc. We had everything we needed! There are several restaurants' on the same block and right behind is a alleyway where patrons eat drink and be merry so if you are staying in the master you will hear them until about 2 am, but its not overly loud so it didn't really bother us. One last thing, we had the opportunity to eat at Island Breeze caribbean Restaurant and the food was amazing!"

The Lofts are located right near the river in downtown Elizabeth City. There are lots of interesting bars and restaurants right nearby. The Museum of the Albemarle is just down the street. We went to the Outer Banks for a day trip, the drive is about 45 minutes. Plenty of things to explore!
Highly recommended."

Stayed with kids","Our family gathered central distance from Raleigh NC and Charlottesville VA to have a few days together between Christmas and the New Year. The Loft Gardens was festively decorated for the holidays, and we were provided with everything we could possibly need during our stay. We chose it for its accommodating size and historic downtown location. The area was great for walking and exploring . . . river waterfront, a nice variety of good restaurants, The Museum of the Albemarle, a waterfront park where we saw older people fishing from the shore, families feeding the seagulls and a play area for the children. We even located a skateboard park for the teenagers. There is a history lesson here too. The families of the earliest settlers in our country, between Jamestown and Roanoke Island, gradually moved inward and founded this small town between the Pasquotank River and The Great Dismal Swamp. I am encouraged to spend time discovering our small towns during these years of the pandemic."

It was much larger than we anticipated and provided a great space for our family. Doris the host is fabulous and very responsive to any message. The kitchen and living area was a great space. The only thing is that two of the bedrooms back up to an alley that has a few bars and on the weekend it was quite loud until they closed. We are fairly sound sleepers so it did not bother us too much. We will definitely stay here again.

Stayed a few nights","Doris is an excellent host! The loft is a gem and it vastly exceeded our expectations. We were blown away by how spacious and clean it was. It was clear to us that Doris and her team take great pride in setting up the place as comfortably as can be for guests. From the wonderful kitchen, large living room and dining areas, multiple bathrooms and great laundry room, the loft is truly a great place to stay for a family vacation. The generous amounts of clean linens, towels and other supplies made the place feel like being in a five-star hotel. The loft is in a quiet area and from there it's an easy drive to the Outer Banks. Doris takes her hosting responsibility very seriously. She was always available, day and night, to answer any questions we had. She even came up to the loft late one night to help us out when we couldn't figure out how to work an appliance. My family and I rated the place an 11 on a scale of one to 10! We highly recommend the loft! Thank you, Doris, for making our stay so memorable!"

Doris’s place is a lovely loft apartment that was perfect for our needs. The place was spacious and clean, parking was easy and free across the street and the bedding was comfortable. The 3 1/2 bathrooms were terrific for our group of 8, the kitchen had all we needed and it was a great stay. Doris was super responsive with booking and check in was a breeze. We would absolutely stay again and would recommend it highly. The elevator was out of order during our stay but would have been a welcome advantage to reach the second floor. Overall a terrific place. Nice restaurant choices in the area and very easy to find. Easy trip to the outer banks the next day and so much nicer than staying in a hotel. We’ll be back!!"

The loft was beautiful, clean, updated and spacious, and the owner, Doris, was a gracious host w/ quick responses to any questions we had. I would recommend highly to anyone visiting Elizabeth City or the surrounding area"

My husband and I had our marriage celebration there with our close friends and families and everyone was so amazed at how beautiful the place was. I just have nothing but wonderful things to say about this place and its host. Definitely the most gorgeous spot in Elizabeth City, and in the perfect location. ♥️"

Stayed one night","I want to thank the Host once again for providing the best service ever. I have stayed here on different occasions. My recent stay was an important one to me because I had a surprise gathering for my mother’s birthday. Mrs. Doris and her team went all out to make sure the moment was unique, exciting and memorable for my mother. The service was top notch from the layout of the loft, the food provided for dinner and the customer service from everyone. My family was able to relax and have a great time. I have already booked this location for future stays because I know the quality service I will receive. The expectation has been met and exceeded during each visit."

Group trip","My family rented this amazing loft on our way to vacation in the Outer Banks. In the past, we have stayed in hotels, but have grown to enjoy renting from Airbnb. This is our favorite rental to date. It is a New York style loft above an amazingly cool restaurant. The restaurant delivered food for us right to the loft. It was delicious and plentiful. We were also gifted two bottles of wine to drink at dinner, which we greatly appreciated. Each of the ensuite bedrooms are beautiful with lovely linens and furnishings. The pillows are high quality. The kitchen, which we didn’t use, is a chef’s dream. The amenities are fantastic. There are soft fluffy towels and baskets of high end toiletries in each bathroom. The sofas are exceptionally comfortable, and fold out to make double beds. The dining table is large enough to seat our group of ten. You can walk out onto the roof, and look out over the city. There are two balconies which look over several small outdoor patios/pubs. In the evening, the entire back alley was lit with white lights and you could see people enjoying the evening. When we return, we are planning on partaking in this nightlife, as well as investigating the lovely downtown area. The space is immaculate, stylish and warm. The elevator was so helpful for my mom who is handicapped. In fact, my mom wanted to just stay there for the entire week instead of going to our vacation house. Doris was awesome in her communication and generosity. We are planning on making this a yearly tradition. It was truly magical. Cannot recommend it enough."

My friends were in awe of this lovely AirBnb and we all plan to return because of how much we enjoyed the home and hopitality.

The loft is more beautiful in person, it's open and spacious, comfortable, and homey. The large open area was perfect for late night planning and large group dinners. Each bedroom has its own private bath which was also perfect for us as colleagues. Each bath had a complimentary basket of travel necessities which came in handy more than once.
From check-in to check-out Doris was fully available via text message and quick to respond to any questions or needs we had. The home was stocked with beverages and wines and that was a welcome surprise!
Our week was fabulous and we'd recommend Loft Gardens to anyone visiting Elizabeth City! It's within walking distance to pretty much anything and plenty of delicious places to eat - including Doris' Island Breeze (SO YUMMY!) which is right down stairs.
We can't thank Doris enough for such a fabulous and comfortable week!"

Loved that she had cable tv and ability for other. Alice is a wonderful hostess, very friendly, helpful and personable. Lots of good suggestions and great conversations with her. The property has a big dock that you can fish and swim from on both sides/fire pit. Very quiet neighborhood, river front , beautiful sunrise/sunsets from the deck settee or the dining area. Comfy bed, the bath with a tub with a view is amazing and a shower too! Just what we needed. Loved that there was a washer and dryer in the unit too. The Kitchen is very well appointed and has everything you need to cook anything. We will definitely be back soon! Thank you Alice for making our vacation awesome!

For the downtown area, I recommend The Kraken coffeehouse and Sagos on the river for great food with gorgeous scenery.

We were traveling the Intercoastal Waterway by boat, which made a stay at Alice's on the waterfront ideal. We could tie up in her boat slip, fish from the dock, and idle over to downtown to enjoy some amazing restaurants and community activities. Alice also provided bicycles we used several times for the short ride to downtown. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit. Elizabeth City may be one of the best kept secret destination spots in Eastern NC. And Alice's place is a great place to stay!"

The property as a whole wasn't quite as well kept as the apartment and things were pretty covered in spider webs and dirt so we didn't spend as much time outside on the docks as we anticipated. But it's easy access to Edenton as well as the Outerbanks which was nice. The owner lives below which we always felt aware of, but were not ever bothered by. She's very kind."

Alice was able to provide some excellent suggestions, especially for what to do for Sunday night dinner (Coinjock Marina, worth the 30 minute drive), when many of the better places in town are closed. The property is on the Pasquotank River in Elizabeth City, and we had no trouble parking our kayak trailer. Access to the river was a primary amenity we were looking for and this property has great access to the river, with multiple docks with ladders and seating on the docks as well. The breeze was amazing, especially as our unit was on the 2nd floor. We will be staying here next time we come to Elizabeth City!"

The sunrise from bed is worth the visit. This little studio is richly furnished and everything was spotless and new feeling. The sofa is very comfy and nice, the bed and pillows were so lovely. We added our HBO Max and watched our shows. So nicely located just a short walk (.4 miles) to a waterfront restaurant and the rest of the little downtown. The house sits on a huge dock and there’s deck and chairs all around the boathouse. We laid out and got some sun and took in the amazing views. Our host met us on arrival and said a quick hello and we were on our own for the rest of the trip, though she was a step away if we needed her.
Allergens: I did not detect any hint of mold or mildew here. There were no strong air fresheners either. The only scent that I noticed was the soap next to the kitchen sink and the trash bags."

Stayed one night","If your considering this apartment just do yourself a favor and book it. Alice is such a sweet and helpful hostess. Southern hospitality at its finest. The studio apartment is a cozy and fully equipped. It is very charming open concept room with lots of natural light from windows and skylights. You are literally situated on the water, so you have absolutely beautiful views from anywhere on the property including all the seating areas Alice has situated around the home. The very nearby town has little cool restaurants and breweries with views. We even did a little axe throwing. Overall we very much enjoyed our stay at this property. If we were ever even remotely close to Alice again, there would be no doubt we’d stay again."

We had our bass boat with us and arriving at night, so she met us in the driveway and helped us figure out best way to park the boat. The apartment was so clean and had the most amazing views — from every window. We will definitely return!!"

Stayed a few nights","A truly lovely and unique place. You are right on Albemarle Sound . You wake up with the rising sun dancing on the ceiling reflected off the water that is at your front door. Have tea on the front porch trying to guess what king of fish just jumped and splashed. In the evening you see the shadow of the fading sun travel across the sound and night envelope you like a childhood blanket.
I needed some R&R between high energy tech jobs and found it. Also there are some great moderately priced golf courses in the area."

Alice was there to greet us and give us local tips on restaurants which we tried...really great food (try Montero's)! Her fishing pier on both sides of the place were used daily during our stay. Hospitality in Elizabeth City is warm and welcoming. My fiance and I would definitely stay here again!

Stayed a few nights","Alices home was a delightful, picturesque slice of heaven. Like being on a private island or in your own lighthouse, water views from so many windows. The home is clean, comfortable, stylish, and quiet. The Wi-Fi was fast And all appliances worked perfectly. The listing mentions it is not suited for young children because of the deep water access. For all others, your search is over. Look no further. Booking this vacation property is a win! You will be very lucky if you find that it is available. And, during the current times, having a home so clean and sanitized provides you with a very cool way to self isolate and take a little break from the outside world. Thank you again for hosting me and I have saved your listing and hope to return!!"

Stayed a few nights","This place is BEAUTIFUL!! And at an unbeatable price! The entire place felt very spacious even though it is essentially a studio apartment. The host Alice was very kind and was ready to help at any given moment. I would be remiss if I didn’t think to tell future travelers that the host did not seem too worried about COVID-19. However the place was sparkling clean, the space was private, and I’m sure Alice would gladly wear a mask if asked to, as her intent to make us as comfortable as possible was clearly indicated time and time again. Overall, I was pleasantly shocked at the quality of my stay. A gorgeous area, a beautiful place, and a lovely host! This was my best Airbnb experience to date. My partner and I will definitely be renting this exact place in the future."
