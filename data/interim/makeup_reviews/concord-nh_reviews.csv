Stayed with kids","We came for a wedding and this was the perfect place to gather extended family together. The living room with the adjoining dining room/sitting room was perfect for a large gathering and the babies loved the train table and all the toys. My adult children liked how convenient it was to get to downtown Concord with the coffee shops and restaurants.
One thing was not obvious to me, but maybe with an older house it should have been. The stairs are very, very steep so it may not be appropriate for an older guest or young child. The one bedroom and bathroom upstairs should be assigned to the young and nimble. We had those as part of our guests, so no problem for us. The downstairs bathroom is on the other side of the house from the two downstairs bedrooms which might be an issue for those getting up often at night. The location of this delightful house far outweighed these issues, but just thought I would mention them in case the house will not work for others."

Stayed a few nights",We really enjoyed Adam's house. It has been clearly loved and cherished and the character of his artist mother permeates through out. (The tile work by hand on the kitchen back splash and around the bathtub is truly amazing!) It is in a great location that allowed us to walk most places and was even a couple of blocks from an EV charger for our car. With the supplied portable heaters everyone was very comfortable despite the cold rainy days we encountered. All information provided was clear and the couple of questions we had during our stay were answered promptly. We will be visiting Concord occasionally and would definitely enjoy staying here again.

Group trip","It's a very cool old house a few blocks from downtown Concord. House had lots of space, was well equipped and was very comfortable for our group. We enjoyed the convenience to downtown. I was also very happy that Adam has realistic expectations of renter's responsibilities for cleaning upon departure and reasonable cleaning fees. Too many rentals these days expect a full detailing of the house on top of excessive cleaning fees. We did have a minor issue upon arrival but Adam was quick to help solve the issue which was very much appreciated. Would definitely stay at this property again!"

Stayed with kids","This is a wonderful, old house. It's clearly been maintained with love and care, we felt right at home when we got there. Lots of room for the whole family, terrific dining/kitchen area with a door to the back porch. Kitchen is well-equipped if you need to cook. The bedrooms are cozy and comfortable. In addition to the porch, there's also a patio with mosquito netting, for sitting outside. Adam was very responsive to all communications and included clear instructions throughout the house on how everything worked. We stayed for three days, and the whole family had a wonderful time! The location is right next to the State Capitol and the Library, so you're minutes from downtown Concord. White Park is a five minute walk, and we can't recommend it highly enough. This is a great location to experience historic Concord, definitely check it out!"

Stayed one night","Impeccably clean rooms. Super comfortable queen-size bed. The little room with table, refrig, tea offerings, etc. was a nice unexpected extra. The bathroom is very small, especially the sink area that was somewhat awkward for to use, but all was serviceable and spotless/polished. I was not crazy about the taking off shoes part of this that I did not know ahead of time; maybe I missed it. Main reason is that the entrance to the steep stairs is tiny and there was not enough room for two people and two suitcases to be there while taking off shoes. I also do not enjoy walking around in socks. Would have brought house shoes had I known. The very steep stairs are not conducive to older people. The price was fair, but the hotel down the street would have been about the same. I purposely did not bother Josh while there, but from the speed of his reply when I asked a question before booking, I can say that he would be extremely helpful if needed. Rooms all perfectly cared for."

Going forward, I’ll be checking to see if Josh’s place is available before anywhere else. This place was so clean and perfect for work travel as it has all you need for a very affordable price. It’s a house shared by others, however, it’s incredibly private and very safe. I loved the off street parking as well! Not to mention Josh was very responsive and friendly… 10/10 recommend this place to anyone traveling the area looking for a simple and safe place to stay.

Provided dish ware, toaster oven, microwave, hotel size fridge with freezer, and full sink in the laundry room to wash dishes. The parking lot entrance is off of Liberty Street, though address for GPS is on School Street; just something to be aware of when parking. Parking lot is spacious and no need to park on a street which is great. Only a 3-minute ride from good breakfast options and just 4-5 minutes ride to downtown/Main Street. There are a fair amount of stairs to navigate to get inside to the room; anyone with mobility issues might find them steep, but not an issue otherwise. Overall a great deal for the location and size of the rental!"

The king size bed had soft sheets. The bathroom was spotless. Ashley was very responsive. We will definitely stay again."

However, a lack of attention to detail meant we had no local information, no check-out procedure, a cold apartment with not much control of the heat, not enough supplies. We have lived in the area and know how to get around so didn't need the local information, but that's not true for all. It's a challenge to lock and unlock the doors due to the age of the building."

Stayed a few nights","If you love and appreciate beautiful Victorian homes, then this is the place for you! My husband and I stayed at “the castle” for 3 nights on our first trip to New Hampshire. It’s more like staying in your own personal apartment then at a air bnb!
The space looks exactly as shown in the photos. Ashley and her husband do a great job of adding lots of little details and touches (down to the popcorn and max & cheese!). The bed is really comfortable and the washer/dryer was great to have on hand.
The location is VERY easy to find via gps and there is a parking lot for guests that made it easy to come and go. My husband and I had a great time using it as our base for the weekend.
Concord is a adorable town. The bnb is about a 15 minute walk to the Main Street. Tucker’s, a great spot for breakfast, is about a 20 minute walk through the neighborhood with lots of Victorian houses to view along the way.
We spoke individually with both Ashley and her husband. They are extremely nice and lovely people that wanted to make sure we had the best experience while staying at “the castle”.
The house was very quiet and it was great to come back to a relaxing place after exploring all day.
I highly recommend anyone stay here! We hope to come back next fall and cannot wait to be at “the castle” again :)"

Stayed a few nights","The pics of this airbnb are great and make you think you ate getting this great old castle location, but in reality it's just an old junky house, you can'/t tell it's a castle unless above in a drone. It's very hard to find by GPS, and then the hallways were dark and they use old keys to open the locks. The front door was never locked by other tenants (probably because the doors are so old it's hard to do so unless pulling on the door while turning the key.
So while I could have paid half the price for a much better located airbnb and much more modern, I got suckered into this by the pics and the supposed ""superhost""
Let me tell you the communication was horrible from the moment I arrived and ultimately ended with them kicking me out (apparently because a guest overheard me yelling at ""myself"" when I misplaced some of my items (and thought they were stolen because I was in such a dump in such bad neighborhood)
I know people will go to this place because of the pics and the supposed reputation of the renters. All I can say is AVOID THIS PLACE like the plague and hope you don't end up in the same situation I was. This place is so bad I may never use airbnb again, nevermind simply avoiding the concord ""bs castle"" forever!!!
I'm just so happy to be home and away from the situation I ended up in because I made the mistake of renting this dump."

Every detail in Concord Castle was designed to make us feel relaxed, comfortable and pampered--post-shower robes, mini fridge, coffee station, tasteful and cozy decor. The king bed was a dream, the rocking chair in the turret was a sanctuary. The temperature was pleasant with AC and ceiling fans, and we appreciated the use of the washer/dryer. The location was short walking distance (6 minutes) to beautiful White Park and a short 5 minute drive to Main St. And lastly, Ashley was very responsive to our questions, and even allowed us an extended check-out which I really appreciated. We were so grateful for the peaceful and quiet aura Ashley's Castle provided--everything about it was a 5*!"

I was desperately needing a place to settle down in the middle of a long road / work trip. I was so comfortable there, it felt like home. I barely left for 5 days. The king size bed is incredible, and the reading book in the castle tower was the cherry on top. I hope to come back here in the fall sometime, so I can use it as a base to explore more of New Hampshire. Concord is a great little town as well. The castle was the best Air B&B experience I’ve ever had."

I rushed from coastal maine to Concord when my 97 year old dad was taken to the ER. I was up all night. I explained my situation and inquired about an early check in. The space was vacant that night so I got in early. I was able to nap before bouncing back to the hospital.

Stayed with kids","We really enjoyed our stay here. It was a nice setup for a family with young kids, close to our in-laws and to downtown.
Pros:
- Nice kitchen with necessities (gas stove, dishwasher, basic pots/dishes). Ample dish towels and cleaning supplies.
- Kitchen basics: sugar, flour, coffee filters (no coffee), tea, salt and pepper
- Dining table was nice
- Bathrooms well equipped with shampoo and body wash, shower had a removable shower head
- Linens smelled nice
- Nicely furnished with stylish but simple decor, soft rugs, smart tv, child-friendly layout
- Nice and safe neighborhood
Things to make us return without doubt:
- The beds were too uncomfortable for us (trampoline-like and noisy). This was the biggest drawback for us but admit we're light/picky sleepers and most people are not.
- There was lots of light which we loved; blackout curtains in bedrooms would be a huge plus for kids/other time zones.
Overall, a very nice place close to downtown Concord. Thanks for sharing your home!"

Stayed with kids","We stayed here during the week of Christmas while visiting family. The hosts are very communicative and friendly and answered all of our questions leading up to the trip.
Check-in was flexible and easy! The house was ready a few minutes earlier than expected, so we didn’t even have to wait after arriving into Concord from the airport.
My husband and I were traveling with our toddler, so we only used two of the bedrooms. We wished the bedrooms had been more cozy and comfortable, but we were able to borrow some extra blankets from family to make it feel more like home.
Proximity to downtown and White Park were a HUGE plus while traveling with a toddler. So was the bathtub upstairs and the on-site washer and dryer! 😍
Thankful to the hosts for their hospitality over the holidays."

They responded right away to any questions or requests. Daniel and Megan seemed eager to ensure that I had a pleasant stay in their house."

Mark always reaches out a day or two ahead of my stay to let me know any important details, like when he will be in the area or who I should reach out to if he is away. I’m usually in the area for school, so I greatly appreciate the space to set up a school/work station, and how Mark is available as needed. I appreciate his attentiveness and responsiveness, but also appreciate that I have my own entrance to a private space for when I need to pick up work late into the evening."

Mark’s carrier house was the exact space and environment I was looking for when I booked my trip: a place with a slower pace, walking distance to places to eat, smoothies and ice cream, driving distances were perfect and foliage was just about to peak. Highly recommended and I look forward to another stay in the near future.

Stayed over a week","Loved this carriage house! Mark & Jan were hosts for my first ever month-long stay with AirBnB. I could not have asked for better or more accommodating & attentive hosts. They were helpful and there when I needed- but were never intrusive. The furnishings were lovely- the bathroom is huge- and the bed is super comfy. Great stay, and wonderful hosts!!"

The apartment is private, clean, comfortable and bright.We really appreciated having a full kitchen, comfortable seating, and laundry facilities. We have spend a lot of times in airbnbs this past year and this is one of our favorites. Great location - walking distance to all that downtown Concord has to offer. Jan and Mark were superb hosts - going out of their way to make us feel like guests while respecting our privacy. We highly recommend this place."

The only tiny downside was that the internet was only intermittently functional, so I wouldn't recommend it if you need to be online a lot during your trip."

Stayed a few nights",The carriage house is a gem and so very beautiful. There is an attached porch where you can sit and enjoy coffee or a glass of wine while overlooking beautiful gardens! It is very clean and stocked with basic necessities! The carriage house is close to downtown Concord- you can walk to everything. There is also an adorable park close by where you can walk your furry friends! The hosts are very kind and communicative and are more than willing to give you suggestions of things to do/experience in the surrounding area (there is also a list of local attractions and restaurants located inside the carriage house). If you are looking for a place to stay that is close to downtown Concord do not miss out on this amazing opportunity!

Their Airbnb is fabulous and Is stocked with everything you need and they are experts on the area and can help with anything you would want to know about the area. Mark was even so kind to clean off my car for me every time it snowed which was a lot and much appreciated. I stayed with them for a 3 month work assignment and it was definitely a home away from home. Thank you Mark and Jan for making our stay great!

The New Hampshire Historical Society and the State Library are even closer, on Park St. My daughter and I spent 2 nights here, then I chose to book the next night, to extend my stay.

I would have given five stars except that the first night the central heating wasn’t working ( it’s an old system with steam radiators). Communication on resolving the issue initially wasn’t great in terms of the attitude of the initial host who responded (there is more than one person helping manage the unit). But eventually appropriate apologies were made and the heat was fixed the next day. Was just a thermostat problem. Fortunately they did have space heaters in the apartment and also the second smaller bedroom has its own electric baseboard heat, so we were fine."

We stayed downstairs (another locking keypad on our door) and someone else was staying in the upstairs apartment. The place was clean and had what we needed for a quick overnight. My friend didn’t love the mattress in the room with the double bed, but the queen bed was fine in our room. We got in kind of late and the apartment was rather cold. My friend is hot blooded so she loved that! I used a space heater for my bedroom and it warmed up quickly and nicely. (My husband couldn’t figure out how to turn on the radiator-there were instructions- but we thought perhaps they weren’t officially “on“ yet.) Space heaters were perfect. It was about an hour from Boston. Not sure about Concord itself as a city with things to do, as we continued on our way early the next morning and didn’t hang out. But it was a perfect overnight and I would definitely recommend if you’re trying to get out of the city!"

Stayed a few nights","I can't really say anything bad about the place. There is climate control in every single room, the water pressure is great, and it is very clean. The beds are comfortable, and there is plenty of space for even 5 people. The location is great, it's quite literally a two-minute walk to an amazing Pizza joint called Checkmate Pizza that serves delicious food, and it can be delivered to you as well. There is an absolutely beautiful park also within a 10-minute walk as well as a laundromat. It's in very close proximity to Ft. Eddy Plaza, which hosts many different places to shop and eat. Above all else is the fact that the amenities offered really make the place feel like home, with cookware, dishes, utensils, a dishwasher, an oven, a microwave, a toaster oven, and a variety of seasonings make it easy to prep your own meals if you are into doing that sort of thing on vacation. We were lucky enough to have a loaf of bread in the cupboard, as well as peanut butter. It saved us from having forgotten to buy breakfast food the day before, and we got to stay in during the morning hours. If you need to do any sort of homework or want to use spare time to do some work before going home, there is either a comfortable study in the bedroom to do this, or a comfortable seat at the bar. The WiFi is very fast, and there is a nice smart TV in the living room to watch movies on. It's also very quiet, not many cars or any sort of aircraft flying by. If you have trouble sleeping with noise, you won't have any difficulty here. I don't typically write reviews on many things, but I really enjoyed the stay, I'm sure you would to!"

Stayed one night","I stayed here one night, and ended up booking another few nights as my trip was extended. I don't entirely understand the layout of the home, i believe someone lives downstairs and upstairs. is a series of rooms for airbnb. I never saw a soul. The room was so cozy private and felt safe. The shared bathroom is the cleanest bathroom ive ever seen, it was like fairies went in there after every person. They had a lot of nice extras for me, water in the fridge, coffee pods and granola bars, like for the very low price it was really nice, and also the neighborhood is incredible. Concord is two seconds away walking and every restaurnant is right there. The street is quiet and the bed insanely comfortable. A perfect 10"

If you’re in the area and looking for a clean and safe place to crash, this is definitely a great option!

The sun literally travels from one window to the other, and I stayed in December! There are other great features too, such as a laundry option, toaster, tea, coffee and much more. Communication is smooth. Thank you thank you"

However the bathroom needs to be shared with the rest of the floor and we didn’t feel that the bedroom was private enough cos we could hear the person in the next room and I’m pretty sure they heard us too. No utensils were available to use any of the common food available (like cereal).

Stayed one night","McKayne's AirBnb surpassed my high expectations. Tuckers, the top-rated place in Concord for full breakfasts, was only 1.3 miles from his home. I instantly relaxed in my room and slept better than usual. The bed was extremely comfortable, and no loud traffic in the morning. Everything was pristine. His excellent online guide was provided upon reservation. I messaged excerpts to my phone from my home to ensure I could access wifi easily. All was handled perfectly with no in-person contact required. Finally, McKayne thoughtfully permitted me to use a hallway armchair after checkout, so I could attend my online class. Each room has individual controls for the ceiling fan, the portable air-conditioner, and there were more than ample outlets for recharging phones, tablets, laptops, etc."

The hosts were very thorough with communication with regards to an incoming snow storm and off street parking in one of the city's garages. The car stayed nice and dry, and the walk gave me an opportunityto discover what a beautiful and safe neighborhood this house is located in. Located a couple blocks from the State Capitol Building, expect to see many historical and well maintained homes in the area. Again worth noting is how quiet the space was affording a great place to sleep between twelve hour shifts of work. Excellent value as well and will look forward to future stays!"

Window AC kept the room nice and cool. Shared bathroom was also huge and I didn’t have any problems with it being available when I needed it. Street parking was perfect as there was always space available on the cross street during the day which was steps away from the home, and space available right in front during the evening. Quiet neighborhood within walking distance or a very short drive to downtown Concord and conveniently located to major highways. Will stay again in the future!"

Stayed one night","Easy check in and good instructions. The room was as described. Unfortunately, as you open the main door, you are hit with an extremely strong animal urine odor which is coming from one of the downstairs tenants. The smell follows you up the stairs and there are even in the shared bathroom. Luckily, my room escaped the smell which is why I stayed the night. The room and bathroom are clean and well stocked. I am not sure how many people use the upstairs bathroom but 3 people upstairs and at least 1 downstairs. Which meant that someone is always waiting to use it...
The biggest problem is that when I brought this to the attention of the host, they merely said: ""apologies"". Zero customer service, no shock at the conditions and no reassurance that they would fix this issue. I stayed one night in a pinch but unless this health hazard is taken care of, I would not stay again."

It's an incredible location for Concord. The room was secure, and clean, and very easy to enter and leave. Check in, and check out, was as easy and punching in the code.

Surprising because of how peaceful and quiet is is, in spite of its it proximity (just a few blocks) to the busy capital hub of downtown Concord. The space was just as described in the listing; sparkling clean, in a peaceful, quiet rural neighborhood setting. The home is beautiful and the space was perfect for my 34 year old son from Los Angeles visiting NH. He couldn’t stay with us (for health reasons) and this stay gave him a whole new outlook about the area on so many levels. I wanted to extend the stay but sadly it was booked. Highly recommend!"

The advertising represents the accommodations colorfully and accurately, and the location truly is central to Concord’s best offerings, whether by foot or car. The rooms and shared space are private, quiet, and replete with just enough conveniences to start or end the day (mini-fridge, microwave, air conditioning unit, closet, and flat screen TV in each room; toaster, kettle, coffee maker in hall. Free storm rage closet, enormous, immaculate shared bathroom with great shower pressure. Key code access is coming convenient, leading to the private entrance of rooms, which are up a high, decoratively carpeted stairwell."

Stayed a few nights","Great Airbnb - excellent location (10 mins walk of downtown, New Hampshire State House, the shops, bars, cafes and restaurants of Main Street, etc.), literally around the corner from NH 4th Highway, but in a quiet, calm, safe neighborhood. Free parking around the corner helps, too. Excellent value for the location, and the amentities are set up like a real hotel (little snacks, water bottles, a mini-fridge, desk, bed, complete towel set and fan all make for a real hospitality experience). The hosts were extremely responsive; my last night, I added an extra night (literally the 11th hour) at the last minute at 11:00pm, only to wake up, first thing in the morning at 7:00am, to see that it was approved. The host always responded immediately, sometimes within 5-30 minutes of me writing. The pinpads that secure the front door and the guest room are easy to use and uncomplicated, and the WiFi is fast and easy to connect to. Really just a very solid Airbnb all around, one of the better ones I've stayed at overall. I highly reccommend. I hope when I return for my next training I can stay here again. I cannot reccommend enough. If you are staying in Concord (or even Manchester and want a nicer, quieter, safer place to stay), check this out - it's super convienient, well priced, well located and well worth it. Check this place out - you won't regret it."

Bed and room were comfortable and quiet and felt like we had privacy even with a shared bathroom (it was clean and available when we needed it.) Can tell the house is historic in the way it’s built which is really cool and also felt it was modernized to fit our current needs, a good balance. Great location near downtown but on a quiet street.
Hosts were super responsive and accommodating while booking and we didn’t need anything during the stay (they thought of it all from extra emergency toiletries if we forgot items to instructions for temp adjustments to cards and games) but I’m confident they would’ve been helpful if we’d needed help while there. Would love to stay again or at one of the hosts’ other places!"

They THEN allowed us to book the next night on the day we were supposed to check out and let us stay another night. Absolutely one of the nicest hosts I've ever had at any BNB."

Stayed a few nights","Brigid was wonderful. We communicated the the app before we got to her house. We were on the later side of checking in. Brigid came outside to greet us. she showed us around. We felt right at home. The next day Mom went to had surgery, when I came back Brigid asked how mom was doing. Which felt nice and she listened as I talked. She let me check out later then 10am on my last morning. We talked a little about quilting and I got to see wall hanging in our room and a quit she had been working on. She lives in a beautiful area. The house has a beautiful, loved homey feel. The bedroom has the same feel, you could bring you computer and work at the little desk and look out at the orchard or sit in the comfy chair and read by the fire. The house is wonderful. For me Brigid and her dog are what made my stay The best it could be. Thank you Brigid for all that you do."

Stayed a few nights","Title: A Hidden Gem in Concord
Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
My recent stay at Brigid's Airbnb property was nothing short of amazing! From the moment I walked in, I was captivated by the charm and warmth of this hidden gem. Dakota did his greeting and a welcome hug. He is a really cute and friendly dog.
Brigid is an outstanding host who effortlessly combines hospitality with a genuine passion for making guests feel at home. They were accommodating, friendly, and quick to offer recommendations for local experiences that truly enhanced my trip.
She has put a lot of thought into every detail, making the space not only stylish but also incredibly functional. My stay at Brigid's place exceeded my expectations in every way. I wholeheartedly recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a memorable and comfortable stay in the heart of the city.
Thank you, Brigid, for your hospitality and for sharing your wonderful space with travelers like me!"

Very easy to get good photo around the house, both inside and outside. Everything was clean and convenient. Brigid was very nice and warm, and she is also a very interesting person who has a lot of stories and experiences that we really enjoy to hear. And her dog - Dakota was so cheerful and friendly.
The neighborhood was safe with most people around are senior citizens. The house is also next to an apple farm, which is a great place to visit.
We feel a little bit regretful that we cannot stay longer. We would definitely book Brigid's house again if we have the chances to visit New Hampshire again."

The bed and bedding were super comfortable and I appreciated she had heat and AC located in the room, even though we didn’t use it, it was nice to have the option. We let Brigid know we were leaving super early in the morning and we woke up and had breakfast laid out for us and she also left us snacks to go.

We enjoyed morning coffee on the deck and interesting conversations with Brigid. She was very flexible to our needs. I would encourage anyone to stay here when in the area of Concord."

She gave us great recommendations to check out such as a vegan restaurant called Col's kitchen in downtown Concord, things to do and explore in Lincoln and Massabesic Lake on our way back to Connecticut. The breakfast with muffins, fruit and oatmeal along with tea and coffee was a nice touch! The room was very peaceful with nice views of the garden and the electric fireplace and salt lamp were nice touches in the room. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.

Dakota, her dog, and I have become good friends, and he has me trained to give him his scratches and loves as soon as I come in. The area is absolutely breath taking in so many different scenarios. From the warm and sun shiny days, to the mornings of a cool fall to the elegant day break with light snow covering the trees. The view always has something to offer and for me just makes my heart smile. If your a person who enjoys the outdoors you will 100% agree when you see it for yourself I’m sure. Brigid is also a wonderful person to sit and talk with and I have sincerely enjoyed making her what I would call a friend not just a host. Thank you Brigid for being my home away from home when I come through Concord."

This cottage was 3 minutes to the hotel and 10 minutes to the venue, so the location is perfection! The cottage is cozy, tastefully decorated, stocked kitchen and great details like k-cups, water bottles, snacks and even necessities like salt, pepper and olive oil. The king size bed is more comfortable that many 5* hotels I've stayed at, and the sheets were AMAZING! I had to find that brand and buy them for my own bed!
I spent the morning after the wedding editing photos in the beautiful living room sipping my morning coffee. It really felt like home.

The Main Street area was approximately a 10 minute walk, although it was too cold for us to walk it. Surprisingly the immediate neighborhood was slightly iffy- as in, I didn’t feel unsafe in general but I don’t think I’d walk it alone at night. The renters had some really nice touches, such as a personalized note and snacks! Overall a great rental, perfect for a ski weekend with restaurant options close-by. Not sure there is much else to do in the area."

They provided everything we would need during our stay, even welcoming snacks and drinks. The space is perfect for our family of 5. We would like to visit again if we go back to Concord NH."

The beds were comfy, the kitchen was very spacious to cook meals and the living room was cozy for watching a little TV in the evenings. Rick and Sarah were very responsive and even offered to go above and beyond to grab me a “Where are you” collection mug from Starbucks when I couldn’t find any in other Starbucks around the state. We had a great stay and would highly recommend to other travelers!"

Stayed a few nights","Rick and Sarah's place was charming and so well equipped. Two lovely bedrooms and an excellent bathroom with walk-in shower. Downstairs was a half bath, sitting room, fully equipped kitchen and an adorable back porch, all beautifully decorated. It was the perfect size for two couples. The location is ideal too, right in the middle of Concord near restaurants and shops and it is very easy to tour around New Hampshire from this location. We were there for a wedding. My aunts had never stayed in a rental and they absolutely loved it. The parking is very specific and there is space for two cars that must be parked back to back against the cottage as there is apartment parking surrounding it. We royally screwed this up but eventually got the parking right. The cottage was a little difficult to find but Rick and Sarah communicated well and sent a picture of its location. Thank you for sharing your lovely place with my family."

We greatly appreciated the thoughtful touches and attention to detail that were apparent throughout our stay. It is evident that the host takes great pride in providing an exceptional experience for their guests. My daughter and I forged beautiful memories here, and we wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place to others. Thank you for a truly remarkable stay!"

The check in time was a little later than we are used to and the check out time of 10:00 was earlier than we are used to. There was an intermittent sound coming from the fridge that made it hard to sleep and the bed was pretty uncomfortable. Same can be said for the couch, but we understand the couch is a pull out and they usually aren’t very cozy. We were hoping for at least a deck of cards or a board game but there were none. This was a good stay but could have been a little cheaper. It is a good stay for one night."

Sara was very responsive and able to help us get everything situated when we arrived. Unfortunately, it was too cold for us to use the fireplace outside but it looked like a great place to hangout in the summertime. I hope to back in the future!"

Stayed a few nights","My girlfriend and I had a great time here. Originally we planned to only spend one night following a day of skiing but ended up booking an extra night. We’re so glad we did! It was the perfect size for us - cozy but not cramped and the furnishings were both pristine and comfortable and the kitchen/bathroom had everything we needed. We often have difficulty with airbnb beds, but we both slept incredibly well. We even discovered an amazing restaurant, Alexandra’s Bistro, just down the street. Overall, highly recommended and would return the next time we head to New Hampshire for a ski trip."

Stayed one night","Sara responded very quickly to a very late same-day reservation. She responded to all my questions before the final reservation. It was a very late check-in (midnight) but she took the time to turn the driveway lights on and did final touch-ups. She was very professional and flexible with a late checkout due to work.
The place is as it is shown. A 5-star experience with a home feeling and all the necessities for a longer stay (I stayed only one night for work). Welcoming and spotless home. It was freezing outside but the home was warm and cozy, and I had a great sleep.
now this place is listed for our upcoming vacation in the area with my family! I Recommend Sara's apartment 100%!!!"

My only serious concern was the other tenants having some negative things to say that weren’t so true about my stay . This has affected my bookings for other stays . However sara didn’t have anything to do with that except for no communication when things like that were said , I was just left a review I didn’t deserve at all without her hearing what I had to say as well first about it ."

We didn't use the kitchen except to make coffee/tea in the morning, but it looked well-stocked and equipped. The bed was very comfortable, a key requirement for us. The bathroom was also clean and well-equipped, nice shower and towels. The heating system was easy to use, quiet and very efficient. As others have mentioned, the stairs up to the apartment are steep and the treads are somewhat narrow. We were aware of this so it wasn't a problem. We would happily stay at Catherine's again."

Stayed a few nights","Sweet hideaway blocks from downtown-great location.
Private off-street parking was helpful.
The space is private and felt like a European hideaway apartment.
Thoughtful touches are everywhere.
Spacious for the two of us.
The only hitch for us was one of the ceiling angles at the entrance-husband is 6'2 and forgot to duck under one of the angles and ouch. He only did that once.
The majority of the space has high ceilings, so not a big issue.
The stairs are a bit narrow and steep and with big luggage, you just need to take it slow.
This is a gem of a space and we will definitely stay again when visiting Concord.
Thank you!"

Stayed a few nights","The addresses on the block are not matched on each side, making finding the house a little difficult. Fortunately, a friendly neighbor was out and was able to help us find where we were going. Parking directions were a bit unclear with a photo but once asked to clarify, the parking was good. The apartment was clean and had good amenities. Private entrance with keypad for entry. The bed was very comfortable! Only negatives were the fridge could have used a better cleaning (glass above the crispers had something underneath it) and there were only 4 hangers in the closet and no dresser for clothing. The only other thing worth a mention was that the door at the top of the stairs does not lock which we found a bit odd as the homeowners could enter the downstairs entry from their side (NOT that they did!) Overall, we enjoyed our 3 day stay and the beautiful neighborhood it was located in. Thanks for the hospitality!"

It’s location is very convenient for visiting Concord’s lovely downtown area. The apartment itself is wonderful - clean and spacious, with a great shower and strong wifi. Although it was a very short visit for us, it’s definitely set up for a longer term stay. We would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anybody visiting Concord!"

Stayed with a pet","What didn’t work well for us is probably that my daughter is disabled and I am 78 years old plus the fact that we had two small dogs. So the issue was that the stairs are extremely steep, glossy wooden ones and the depth is very slim. There is a railing on only one side of the stairs. The dogs were not happy campers and I ended up having to carry them up and down most of the time. I appreciate finding a decent place to book that allows us to bring the dogs, but I did not anticipate how hard it would be to stay in an older home with these type of stairs.
Everything is well kept and should work for younger and more mobile, agile folks. My daughter and I both have physical aches and pains and so sleeping on very soft foam mattresses isn’t the best option for our bodies.
It was a very quiet neighborhood with great access to a lovely downtown! We ended up staying here both going to Maine and on our return trip. Great host and super clean apartment."

Stayed a few nights","This was our third stop on a 25 day roadtrip through New England, and the location was perfect.
We were touring the Law School, visiting the government/capitol buildings, and attending Market Days so it was an easy walk to everything downtown.
The whole space is on 2nd floor up some really steep steps with low ceilings so be aware. The stairs split the space with the master and kitchen on one side and living room, dining room and bathroom on the other. So biggest issue was that flow is a little interrupted.
The space was nice but there were little to no amenities (especially kitchen cookware). But since we didnt cook while there, it wasnt a problem.
Bathroom was only minor issue. No fan so have to leave window open when showering. It was really humid while there so apartment felt damp all the time.
And FYI, bring your own paper products (not TP) incl kleenex.
Overall it fit our needs, location was biggest draw, and the price sealed the deal.
We will stay again if in area."

Catherine and Shane did an excellent job of communicating with us and were so friendly and welcoming. We highly recommend their place and hope to come back in the future!"

Stayed with a pet","What a lovely place. Had a very peaceful few days stay. Extremely clean and quiet and comfortable. The apartment has everything you might need. I worked remotely during the day and explored the area in the evening. Easy walking distance to downtown. I was able to bring my dog also and we walked to White park right down the street every morning.
Host is kind and friendly. Provided clear easy instructions for check in and answered questions immediately. Felt very safe and cozy here. Thank you"

Stayed with a pet","Absolutely wonderful place to stay in downtown Concord! The space is extremely clean, spacious with a great layout, and in a very convenient location. We checked in after dark so we appreciated how simple the arrival instructions were and parking on site made things easier for going to and from the apartment. Our dog enjoyed walking through the neighborhood and visiting White Park just around the corner. Catherine and Shane are fantastic hosts, we hope to visit again in the future!"

Strong Wi-Fi that supported multiple video conferences with no issue. The check-out process gets an A+ from me… the easiest & most reasonable I’ve experienced to date. Would definitely stay here again. High recommendation!"

Stayed one night","We absolutely loved staying here. The apartment has tons of windows, an adorable kitchen, a cozy living room, and super soft sheets on the bed. It was spotless, one of the cleanest airbnbs we've been to. The kitchen has everything you need and is so organized. The street is quiet yet it's just a 10-minute walk to downtown Concord with all the restaurants, shops, and a great movie theater. Catherine was so easy to communicate with. We ended up needing a fan because of the extra warm November weather, and they installed the window fan within an hour. The neighborhood is really pretty and we took advantage of White Park nearby. We will definitely stay here every time we visit Concord."

Stayed a few nights","The apartment is spotless, nicely furnished, well equipped, and close to downtown Concord, and the internet service is strong. The host is friendly, helpful, and very responsive. The electric fireplace kept the living room toasty, but the rest of the apartment felt a little cool during our stay. (The owner increased the heat when asked, but I didn’t want to make repeated requests). Presumably the room heating/cooling units—not yet operational when we stayed—will even out the temperature."

Stayed one night","Catherine is a host extraordinaire. I felt as tho I was communicating with a long time friend thru all of my messaging regarding processes, procedures and questions regarding airbnb arrangements. The apartment is outstanding and as I told Catherine, the apartment reminds me of what I envision a 5 star New York City loft would look like. The space is so welcoming, cozy, expertly decorated and has all the amenities one could possibly need. I can envision staying for an extended period of time because of the space amenities. The apartment is within walking distance from beautiful downtown Concord (my birthplace by the way) and is centrally located just a few miles from Route 93, Route 89 and NH Routes 3 and 4. Catherine provides a comprehensive resource book that lists all of the local and geographic highlights of the area. I have to add another star to the 5 star assessment and a ++ to this beautiful spot. I truly hope to be able to stay with Catherine again!"

The local area is nice; we particularly enjoyed Pitchfork Records and the Siam Orchard Thai Bistro along Main Street. Catherine was a wonderful, pleasant host! She let us check out later than 11am upon our request and kindly recommended a local mechanic to look at our car when it had some issues. Would definitely stay here again!"

Stayed with kids","I have stayed at many Airbnb's and used to be a host myself. Catherine has thought through so many details that add that special touch to her place. Extra towels, stocked Keurig, notebook & link with local suggestions, nightlights that guide your way to the bathroom at night, etc. I also can't rav enough about the comfy beds! I had told her we were bringing our 2 kiddos and she had the pull out couch all set up for us on arrival and it was so comfortable that my husband and I argued over who would get to sleep on it! (The main bed was just as good though). such cute decor, walking distance to downtown, the list goes on. Great little place."
