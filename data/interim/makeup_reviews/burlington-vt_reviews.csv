Stayed with kids","Abbott’s place was just as advertised. Centrally located in Burlington, walking distance to the waterfront and Church Street Market. Check in was super easy and convenient.. The apartment was flawless.. Every detail thought of and executed. The apartment was so clean and had everything we could possibly need. We loved staying here and would without a doubt recommend it. We would stay again here for sure!"

Stayed a few nights","Such a lovely place to stay. So many great things about this Airbnb. I was immediately impressed with how bright and clean it felt. Lots of simple nice touches that add to the experience. Fresh flowers, snacks, bandaids. Sometimes when you arrive at an Airbnb it doesn’t quite feel as nice as the pictures. That’s not the case here. I’d be happy to stay here again or at any of Abbott’s properties."

Stayed a few nights","This place is a stunner! While a basement unit, you rarely notice it with all of the thoughtful design details. Wide steps to the unit, full sized windows, lots of light and white. And the bathroom is crazy indulgent.
Not only is it great looking, they thought about almost everything for your stay. Forget a razor or toothbrush - got you covered. Need a snack or quick meal - got you covered. Need a cozy blanket - they got you.
The location is also great! While it is a bit of a drive to campus, you can easily walk to the waterfront, Church St. and north Burly.
The only things to be aware of…my husband is 6’3” and the shower was a little short for him.
I’m 5’4” and our daughter 5’9” and we were fine.
If you are needing to use the couches as a foldout bed, they are a little firm, so again, something to be aware of. (The bed was super comfy).
This is a well curated, thoughtful, cozy location. I would not hesitate to stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","What can I say other than this stay was a 10/10. Abbott takes care of all of the details. His stay was beyond perfect. I could not have been more impressed with everything the stay had to offer. The bedroom and bathroom are cozy, clean, and well decorated. The bathroom was fully stocked with every possible essential you could need. Fresh coffee beans in the espresso machine paired nicely with the oatmilk in the fridge. The complimentary skincare products and Vermont made soaps/cheeses were welcome additions.
It felt like walking into your own home except it was a Airbnb stay. Could not recommend enough.
As a basement stay, your neighbors upstairs can be heard but its very faint. All in all MUST STAY IN BURLINGTON VERMONT.
The city is phenomenal as well, crunch/granola-y but fantastic food. Abbott recommended some great spots."

Stayed a few nights","Abbott was such a gracious host, his instructions were clear, easy to understand and he always responded promptly to any questions, recommendations or concerns. His place is incredible, it was even more than described, and you get exactly what you see on the website plus so more more. This host has a lot of class and the amenities were astounding, from the heated toilet seat and towel rack, to the amazing coffee/expresso machine. Also he had an entire facial skin care line for his his guest use, which I fell in love with and want to order. The bed and sofa were super comfortable and very clean and pristine home. I would most definitely stay again and highly recommend his place for future guest. You will not be disappointed and you can thank me later! I am very particular about where I stay when traveling and Abbott's place checked off all the boxes and more."

Stayed a few nights","Rolf's place is cozy and tidy and convenient to everything -- the Church St. marketplace, the waterfront and rail trail, Battery Park right across the street, etc. It's a little hard to find if you don't know the area well, because the name of the road changes from Battery St. to Park St. without enough signage to see it at night. We road around the block a couple of times until we figured it out. Once we did, we realized what a great location this is. Despite being in the thick of things, it's peaceful and quiet with strict quiet hours. The bedrooms are comfy and spacious, and the kitchen is well-stocked. The bathroom is tiny but the shower is nice and hot, and there's a tub if you have the time for a soak. The heat is easy to control and the wifi is super. Parking is easy as is access to the unit. Highly recommend for a quick getaway in BTV."

Both myself and my parents loved how comfy the beds were and slept ""like a rock""!! very clean, and the host was very responsive. I would stay here again and recommend to friends and family. We walked to church street for our meals and walked along the greenway right across the street!!!"

Stayed a few nights","The place was more then satisfactory for our needs. It is very centrally located to all the burlington nightlife, and right across the street from the lake. Parking is a slight issue as at times there were not enough parking spaces available in the lot for the building. In addition the place can be a bid tough to find, and we had to circle around the block a few times. In addition, there is something in the unit (not sure what it is) that makes a lot of noise at random times and sounds like a subwoofer going on for like 3 seconds then goes away. However this did not go off while we were sleeping so it didn't really bother us."

Stayed with kids","A very nice place to stay in Burlington--very comfortable and quiet for us and our little one. Very close to everything downtown and the lake. Had a small issue with the hot water going out briefly one morning, but help was sent very quickly--very responsive. As described, the slope up from the street and across the sidewalk to the otherwise flat driveway *will* bottom out your car, unless you have a pretty high suspension vehicle. (We scraped bottom each time going in and out with a Subaru Legacy, which I thought might be enough to clear it, but was not.) Having the gas station just 200 feet up the road was helpful for grabbing some quick provisions like milk and such. Would definitely look for this location again if returning to Burlington."

Stayed a few nights","The location of this place is really great, super convenient to downtown which was all we needed for a quick trip to downtown Burlington. It's definitely a quirky old house and not a luxury stay, but it's a solid easy, no-frills Airbnb and I think it's priced fairly for what I got. I will note I found the shower a little slippery as there wasn't a wall to hold on to, and the old house walls are thin so I did wake up early in the morning while still dark out to hearing footsteps on the shared stairs with the other unit in the building. I appreciated the way Kathleen ran her Airbnb, check in and out was super easy, plus she didn't expect us to do any extra chores before check out like take out the trash or strip the bed before leaving since we paid a cleaning fee."

A great bagel/coffee shop 10 minute walk away, tucked in the Ethan Allen plaza. Didn't get in to their restaurant, right around the corner- a fantastic option, though!"

Stayed one night","Really unique experience. May not be for everyone but hosts do a great job with their clear listing. Very clean and well maintained. Just keep in mind:
* The bathroom is not that close to the house, so if you need to use it in the middle of the night, that means a walk and braving the elements.
* The bed is on the high side, so would not recommend for anyone who has an issue climbing into bed.
Overall it's a great value, especially for Burlington (which is such a wonderful place to visit)."

Easy access to the paved, mostly shaded bike trail into town for breakfast at the Skinny Pancakes restaurant and in the other direction to the amazing causeway. A biking must. Also
Enjoyed the Shelbourne museum 30 min south of The tiny house.
A wonderful alternative to standard cookie cutter accommodation and half the price."

Stayed one night","The place was small and adorable, exactly as advertised! The tiny home is located behind the main house with access to an outdoor shower, sauna, and a bathroom / shower within the main house. We felt we had our privacy, and it was nice to sleep so close to the outdoors.
The neighborhood is suburban but located very close to the bike trail and a short drive from Burlington proper. Our host was kind enough to lend us two bikes, and riding out to the causeway was a highlight of our stay. Other highlights included visiting the many nearby breweries - Foam, BBCO, Zero Gravity.
Perfect for a couple on a one or two night stay. Book according to the weather / season - there is a heater but no AC. They did provide a fan, but it can get muggy in the summer. Also, bring bug spray in the summer 😊"

Stayed one night","If you like very tiny houses, being close to the bike path and downtown, and relaxing in a quiet neighborhood then this spot is great! Consider it like glorified camping with a gorgeous bathroom and shower (across the lawn) and a very comfortable bed with soft linens. The bike path is 5 minutes away: it is about a 3 mile ride downtown or an 8 mile ride to the beautiful causeway. I was solo and the size of the place was perfect for me; it would be good for 2 people if they really dig each other. I was lucky to meet Trevor and Lisa who were both so welcoming, kind and positive. I will definitely be back if I need a spot in the area!"

The bathroom is across the yard in her house, but is private with its own entrance and has a lovely large walk-in shower. Unfortunately it was raining pretty much the whole time we were there so we couldn’t enjoy the outside area with the hammock (also it was a bit buggy), but we were happy to discover this place and hope to return in nicer weather! Brief addendum: Lisa found an earring I had lost and is sending it back to me—very kind!"

The tiny house had all the perfect amenities you’d need: mini fridge, hot kettle and microwave! Our only regret is not having enough time to use the sauna in the backyard! We hope to be back to visit soon!"

And I can't say enough about how clean it was. I love to walk around barefoot... and my feet stayed perfectly pink in this immaculate apartment. The ""retro"" look is completely charming, and feels as if your living in a time capsule. We only had one issue, which was figuring out the AC. Meghan responded right away, and it was really just a matter of pointing the remote properly. Wonderful spot and great, GREAT location. We parked our car in the designated spot and then walked everywhere for the next four days. Quiet at night, and the kitchen had everything we needed to cook dinners. I would definitely stay here again!"

We enjoyed using dishes and glassware from the 50’s and 60’s, in the kitchen with all the modern amenities. The apartment is larger than it seems in the photos, and as others have noted, it’s quiet and comfortable. We embraced the walkable city of Burlington, rarely using our car. A couple of our highlights included renting a bike and touring to the causeway in Colchester and taking a sunset tour on Lake Champlain on the Spirit of Ethan Allen.

Stayed a few nights","Meghan Jean's charming 2nd-floor apartment was a pleasure to stay in. Lots of nice vintage touches & objects within a fully modern kitchen and apartment. We really enjoyed the spacious sitting room for hanging out and planning our next moves around town during our 3-day stay.
Private parking lot in back of the building was convenient and well-marked.
We strongly recommend."

Stayed a few nights","Meghan's place was spacious and Barbie friendly, decorated in mid-fifties bright colours and retro furniture, complete with Zenith audio system console (amazingly, it partially worked). Kitchen was large and well outfitted. One of the most beautiful places I have stayed over the years. Sturdy legs come in handy to get up the 16 stairs to the apartment, which is above a vintage clothing store. Might be a challenge for some seniors (we are in our 70s), so pack light! Easy parking behind the store. Highly recommended."

Stayed a few nights","My wife and I stayed in Meghan Jean's apartment for 3 nights in July 2023. We enjoyed our stay! She runs the business downstairs so I did pop in to say hello. It's especially nice in that it is walkable to most of the liveliest parts of Burlington; we arrived by car and literally did not move the car after parking it until checkout.
The only slight drawback I'd mention is that we were working 2 of the days that we were there and found that the WiFi could sometimes cut out for just long enough to interrupt videoconferencing. Not badly enough to make work impossible but it would be good to mention at the beginning of a meeting.
Noise sensitive people might notice that one can hear the Burlington Amtrak-train horn from the apartment pretty clearly as it goes through grade crossings, but there is only one of these trains per day in each direction (one morning, one evening). I think the Burlington Amtrak service is cool and was glad to hear it.
Would absolutely stay here again!"

Stayed with kids","This place was really disappointing. The location was great and the decor was cute, but it needs a deep clean BADLY. Everywhere you look and touch, you’ll find dirt and straight up grime. The walls, especially the bedroom. The outside of the kitchen trash can. Need a spoon? The drawers are gross when you open them up. The cabinets. Every single door. The mirror in the bathroom was dirty. The bench in the bedroom is stained. Every inch of molding is covered with dirt and dust. I tried to vacuum but the very vintage Bissell vacuum cleaner did more harm than good. Our socks were so gross after walking around without shoes on. The washer and dryer had so much lint and dirt and disgusting stuff on it it made me cringe to do a load of laundry. I think the vintage decor made it feel like it wasn’t cleaned since the 70s. I seriously can’t believe they have a cleaning fee. Meghan helped when she left us replacement hand soap and new shampoo and conditioner on the steps since the cleaning team forgot to restock. But she entered the apartment to restock the laundry detergent when we were gone and didn’t ask us first and I’m not comfortable with that. I think this place was awesome at one time but it has been rented so many times and you can see and feel that. I read every single review before booking this place for my family and I regret spending so much money to have such a bad experience. I have spent way less and have had cleaner, better experiences. Don’t waste your $500 with fees per night and stay around the corner in another Airbnb - UNLESS they paint and DEEP clean this place big time."

Stayed a few nights","What a picture perfect spot! Loved all the decorative touches - made it a joy to come home to. Place was actually bigger than the photos, bed was super comfy, and location is perfect.
A short walk to super cute downtown, and even closer to the water. Particularly liked the 1/2 mile walk to Myers Bagels and cool artist studios at the Soda Plant.
We came for a ski trip to Stowe which is a bit of a drive, but I think it’s worth it to come home to a bunch of restaurant and bar options at night. And the City Market coop is an easy walk too for cooking in.
We had some struggles with locking the door, so a heads up. Might be because the door warping with the weather. A little frustrating but not their fault.
Overall - excellent stay!!"

The look of the place is what vintage dreams are made of! Only thing to note the furniture by the tv could be more comfy but-TV is not what you will want to do in VT anyways. I think the look is more the point. Bed is comfy and Meghan provides plenty of fresh towels and such so your stay is pleasant.
Overall, I recommend this stay for a taste of vintage in Vermont. She even left us a little basket of welcome treats."

***LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION***
This beautiful apartment is located perfectly to discover and explore Burlington on foot. It is at the Waterfront and right at the bottom
edge of the Church Street Market District. There is a also a great coffee shop right around the corner and close proximity to an abundance of restaurants. We loved that we just parked our car and then spent the next two days walking almost everywhere.
We highly recommend staying at this very cool apartment. We had the opportunity to meet Meghan Jean and think she is just as vibrant and fun as the Airbnb that she hosts.

I appreciated Abbott’s proactive communication - and his excellent list of suggested sites and restaurants. Absolutely one of the best AirBnB’s where I have ever stayed. Thank you Abbott!"

Like other guests have said, it’s surprisingly well lit for a basement apartment. The noise from upstairs did not bother me and I felt like I had enough privacy and space. Overall a great place and host that I’d definitely recommend !"

His home was better in person than seen in the photos. It was very comfortable, clean, and well-equipped with his thoughtful touches. A beautiful bouquet of Lily flowers was on the kitchen counter when we checked in. He also made delicious snacks available to guests, making the place even more welcoming. As he described, the apartment is a basement unit. But you won't even feel you are in the basement with various lighting and windows.
Moreover, he is a proactive communicator with clear instructions and recommendations. We highly recommend staying at his place!"

Stayed one night","Where do I begin? First of all, we lucked up when finding this place available, last minute, because we missed our return flight at the Burlington International Airport. Second, upon entering, we were met with the sweet, subtle aroma of lilies that were arranged on the kitchen’s peninsula island. Meticulous presentation was considered throughout the entire unit. Abbott did not take any shortcuts in delivering hospitality wrapped up in an oasis of calm and convenience. The unit was fully stocked with organic snacks, seltzer water, high-end toiletries and even female products. Like I initially stated, no shortcuts. Abbott considered everything that would make your stay an absolute delight. Hands down 5+ star rating. Because when I walked in, my angst of missing our flight melted.
Much gratitude, Abbott🌺🙏🏽"

Stayed over a week","Abbott’s place exceeded our expectations. We were worried that it was a basement apartment, but once we arrived that concern vanished. It’s so well lit that that your don’t even notice. It has an extremely well appointed kitchen with everything you need to cook. In addition, there were drinks provided and a whole snack drawer, as well as two ways of making gourmet coffee. The bed was comfy and there are two Smart TVs, one in the bedroom and one in the living room. There is air conditioning as well as a gas fireplace for the chillier times in Vermont. The bathroom has a kick ass shower with both a rainfall head and handheld sprayer, and there is a deep, standalone bathtub. We were there two weeks, so it was wonderful to have access to a washer and dryer. Abbott is a great host; he’s there when you need him and unobtrusive at all other times. Easy walk from this place to everything in downtown Burlington and along the lake."

Burlington is such a cool little city! There’s a lot of great restaurants, stores, bars, and coffee shops packed into this relatively little space, and Abbott’s recommendations never disappointed.

The kitchen is fully stocked and organized with everything you need to cook; likely the most organized I’ve seen at the air bnbs I’ve stayed at (example: proper Italian burr coffee grinder with French press and beans to match). It is definitely the most thoughtfully stocked with snacks and accoutrements as well. The design touches are nice and despite being a basement unit he’s invested to make sure there is a ton of light everywhere. My only call out would be for those looking to sleep 5 it would definitely be on the small side. I think this is obvious from the pictures. It can be done but it is s small unit ( was perfect for a weekend stay with my wife and I ). Highly recommend and would rebook if back in Burlington - Abbott is also an excellent communicator.

Stayed a few nights","This was a pleasant surprise - we were not sure what to expect from a ""luxury basement"" apartment but it turned out to be just that: super modern appliances including lighting, fireplace, and kitchen and bathroom fixtures. The fridge was stocked with filtered water and various non-dairy milks as well as seltzers, and the bathroom had a selection of organic skincare products in addition to the usual amenities (liquid soap, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and lotion). The bathroom was luxurious with a giant monsoon shower and standalone tub. Both wiht handheld shower head options as well. The heated towel racks were a nice touch! Abbott was a very accommodating and communicative host and readily answered our questions to help us plan our stay."

The unit is spacious and also offers a bistro set on a small deck to enjoy coffee or a glass of wine. Abbott truly has thought of everything to ensure your stay is perfect- from coffee and creamer options, to snacks, fresh flowers, and “just in case items” (like a toothbrush or in our case, umbrellas!) We look forward to when we can visit again!"

Stayed one night","There truly aren’t words to describe the experience Abbot has created in downtown Burlington. From his detailed communication before our visit to the incredible apartment we had the treat of staying in, we can’t recommend Abbot’s place enough. Highlights include:
- Discovering the many thoughtful details throughout the apartment (we won’t spoil any; come see for yourself!)
- A kitchen stocked with every possible utensil, device, and snack one could ask for (high-quality snacks at that)—one of such great quality we opted to buy our own ingredients at a local market and cook in vs. eat out
- The most comfiest of beds
- Proximity to both downtown and the waterfront (within easy walking distance)"

Stayed a few nights","Abbott is an absolute dream host, and his Burlington apartment is nothing short of perfect. My husband and I travel to Vermont every summer, and we have always stayed in hotels in the Burlington area. This was our first time deciding to stay in an Air Bnb in the area, and we could not have been luckier to stumble across Abbott’s unit.
Abbott’s apartment is in a safe, central location that is in close proximity to all noteworthy areas in the city, such as Lake Champlain, parks, Church Street, and a variety of shops and restaurants. His apartment is stunning, extremely clean, and provides all of the luxurious comforts you could wish for when staying away from home.
Abbott is an exceptional host, and he truly goes above and beyond to make your stay as comfortable as possible. He is very kind, accessible, and knowledgeable of the area should you need recommendations. He also provides with you an abundant variety of snacks and toiletries to take advantage of during your stay. He even went out of his way to schedule a complimentary, midweek cleaning during our stay.
I cannot say enough about Abbott and his apartment. My husband and I loved this spot, and we would absolutely stay here again, or in another one of Abbott’s Air Bnb units, in the future. 100% recommend!!!"

Stayed a few nights","Where to even begin! First off I named this luxury basement apartment the “Perfect Snow Flake” for its elegant white beauty! There is so much to appreciate here- this private apartment is a destination of its own.
Every great review starts with honesty & I hate to write anything negative but here goes:
Location: I was a bit underwhelmed with Burlington itself- My boyfriend and I visited for just a few short nights and it seems as though this city has “fallen through the cracks” if you will. I was surprised to see the amount of “street people” that I did and from just 5 or 6 years ago I never remember this city being so bad. Every corner we walked was a bit “uneasy” - but maybe this was just the time of year as it being warm. Aside from that— we did have boat plans that were canceled due to heavy rain so one of our main activities that I was looking forward to was canceled.
Restaurants & Activities: Church street has so many shops and restaurant- you can spend the day or spend the week and still explore a new little niche each day. The summer time has Lake Champlain boat tours & rides- with dock front restaurants and in the winter time the mountains are a short ride away for boarding and skiing. There is seriously so much to chose from.
Apartment: If we weren’t staying in Abbotts amazing apartment overall our experience would’ve been different, but despite our adventure plans being canceled due to rain, this space was comforting and everything you could want in an Airbnb! Thoughtful touches every step of the way- you really aren’t missing anything- & if you are- the house has it! The rental space is truly perfect & did not disappoint- this stay made our three hour drive worth while! Thank you again!"

It’s nicely decorated with attention paid to even the smallest design details. It is very clean, it has its own washer and dryer which came in handy after skiing close by. We are very happy with our decision of staying here instead of staying at the nearby hotel. Our kids didn’t want to leave because they loved the “snack drawer” which was stocked with a ton of organic and local snacks. They were obsessed with the snacks, they loved them so much that I’ve had to order some of them off of Amazon since leaving. Abbott is definitely not your average AirBnb host he’s surely a Superhost. If you stay here you won’t be disappointed. We would re-book in the future if visiting the area."

Great remotely-controlled fireplace, magnificent bathroom with a great rain shower and a toilet that does more than you could ever imagine. The kitchen was fully stocked with brand new appliances that enabled us to cook great meals. The huge flat screen tv in the living area made us feel like we were at a movie theater while binging on The Beatles Get Back documentary.

Stayed a few nights","Well what should I say about Abbott's place? I don't even know where to start. My wife and I enjoyed three nights there while relaxing to get away from some stressful work weeks, and to wander around Burlington a bit. It's perfectly located away from the chaos of church street, but close enough to walk to.
When you get inside, holy cow the attention to detail just comes out and hauls off and smacks you in the face. The place is new, fresh, and every single corner of it has been thought out. From the towel warmer in the bathroom, to the awesome shower to the soaking tub for two from heaven, and then there's that toilet seat, I won't go into details, but when you know you know :-)
The kitchen.. has more stuff in it than you could possibly need, and holy cow Abbott, the snacks! Organic, reasonably sourced everything at your fingertips. Drawers of goodies for you to cater to your late night cravings. the refrigerator was full of an array of seltzers, some eggs for breakfast, the freezer had multigrain bread for toast, and these amazing delicious ice cream bars. The pantry was stocked with various pastas and pasta sauces and grains and anything you would need to whip up a simple quick meal if you had forgotten to grab groceries or just needed a little something to eat at the end of the day. They had a French press there to enjoy coffee in the morning but I needed cream and sugar. I sent a message to Abbott and in a matter of minutes there was a freaking gift basket at the top of the stairs with oat milk, almond milk, soy milk, and a mason jar full of raw sugar. like I said. attention to detail. My wife needed to print a return slip for UPS, and boom it appeared at the top of our stairs with packing tape in tow. I'm telling you right now I stay almost exclusively in airbnbs everywhere I go and I have never had a more satisfactory experience anywhere I have ever stayed.
Just make sure you understand, this is in a basement of a little bungalow on a side street. When you come in you may say where am I staying? And then you get inside and you're like oh man this is my bomb shelter bunker from heaven.
Go here, no, actually don't go here, that way it's more available for me when I want to go back :-)"

She kindly accommodated to accept the reservation late in the evening. During our stay, not only was she extremely responsive but also proactive to check in and offer suggestions for things to do. She even took the time to greet us in person, very few owners do that nowadays!
She has an amazing taste to decorate the studio to make it feel so comfy that we struggled to get out of it. Besides, it was one of the very few airbnbs where owners pay attention to the small details and provide very high quality appliances and products.
Slippers and robes?, Coffee/tea? Extra towels?, make up towels?, hairstyle products?,… you name it, Nancy already thought of it and is available in the room.
Finally, she also accommodated to allow us to vacate the room once the snow stopped on our last day. WE WILL DEFINITELY COME BACK."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I enjoyed our stay at Nancy’s place this December. The place was very clean, comfortable and furnished with care. It is located across from the UVM campus and within a 15 minute walk to downtown Burlington. The only ‘negative’ we encountered was some late night noise overhead. The Airbnb room is a separate self contained space on the first floor of the house with its own entrance. However, there is a portion of the residents home above the airbnb. When the residents came home late at night we could hear them walking around overhead. It was relatively minor and didn’t detract from our enjoyment of the place, but it felt like it should be mentioned."

The place was well-decorated and the instructions were very clear from check-in to check-out. The shower was phenomenal - the shampoo, conditioner, and body wash dispensers were a nice touch. While the apartment is attached to the home and the hosts were of course very hospitable, there was still a feeling of privacy. In terms of location, it is conveniently very close to the Church Street Marketplace and Lake Champlain but the house itself is on a very peaceful road. Everything was also super clean.

Essentially as pictured, spotless, inviting with great quality bed, pillows, and linens. Keurig for coffee with creamer in the fridge. Appreciated the warm greeting, openness to questions and booklet in the room with listing of local eateries. Location great for walking around UVM or downtown with in-driveway parking place. After all this, the best for us was the porch with comfortable seating where, after a day of activities, we could relax and review. Plan to stay again when in the area--just wonderful!

The bathroom was well equipped with high end containers for soap, shampoo and conditioner and very nice shower head and wand. Everything was in pristine condition and we appreciated the comfortable bed.

We didn't use the front porch (there's a camera that points at the door which is for security so it just seemed to be lacking privacy a bit), but the grounds were absolutely stunning.
Nancy was great about communicating and left a very helpful guide for us. Off-street parking was a plus, as was the nearby free (as of July 2023) bus line a short walk away. Highly recommend if you want somewhere to land while exploring all Burlington has to offer!
This is shown in the pictures, but the shower is fairly petite in case you're a larger person. :)

Stayed a few nights","We loved our stay at Andy and Nancy's beautiful home. The space itself is well-appointed, spotlessly clean, and beautifully designed for both form and function. We loved the location on a quiet street - far enough away from the center of Burlington but still extremely walkable to restaurants, coffee shops, etc. We took advantage of the lovely front porch, which was a real highlight of our stay! Andy and Nancy were very friendly and communicative - offering to make arrangements to hold our bags before we needed to head to the airport, and providing a long list of their top restaurants in town. Highly recommend them as Airbnb hosts."

Stayed a few nights","What a delightful place to pull up to! Gorgeous yellow home with incredible garden/plantings & front porch, separate entrance at front. The space was outstanding, probably the nicest airbnb we've stayed at. It was so clean, comfortable & decorated so well. Everything about the space was just so well thought out. Such a great use of space, they thought of everything & designed the room in such a way that everything you could need/want was available, but set up so serenely, simply & uncluttered. We loved the design & the furniture. We had the best sleep in the bed, too. Shower was amazing, lots of hot water & great water pressure. Nancy & Andy were very friendly, came out to greet us & to say goodbye. The space is very private & felt separate from the rest of the home. It was such a better choice to stay in this fantastic suite than in a hotel. I already am looking to book another visit! Wonderful hosts and home! Many thanks!"

Stayed a few nights","Nancy’s place is convenient if you’re visiting UVM, which I wasn’t. However, Church Street Marketplace isn’t that far. Just don’t bother trying to take the free bus. There are no clear signs as to where to pick it up, and I waited 45 minutes and never saw one. Nancy provides plenty of restaurant and activity suggestions in the handbook in the room - almost too many. The addition of a map would have been helpful. There was some confusion as to where to find the information on the listing site; it was not where I was told to look. Communication was good prior to arrival. However, Nancy was away during my stay,and I couldn’t get the answers I needed when I needed them but figured things out on my own. The room itself was okay although the furniture wasn’t particularly comfortable, and the lighting in the evening wasn’t bright enough for my liking - but those are all subjective. Also, if you’re not accustomed to on-demand water, be prepared to wait for a hot shower."

We walked to all the attractions we wanted to hit in Burlington which was a huge plus and had a parking space perfect for our SUV.
Our second night they welcomed us into their stunning backyard and patiently answered our numerous questions about every plant. This would have been a 5 star review regardless but we were absolutely blown away by their kindness. Andy even recommended some hikes in the area we hadn’t seen while planning our trip.

The room is full of thoughtful touches, from the bedside lights with USB ports, to the window shades that provide the right amount of natural light and privacy. I especially found the local guidebook to be a special treat, it helped us find a wonderful last minute dinner spot. I’ll definitely be booking again!"

Loved reading the guest manual and details/history about the property.
On the pricier side for a one night stay, but Nancy accommodated our last minute request and it was much nicer than staying in a hotel room (which have also drastically gotten more expensive than I remember!)
Thanks for the stay!"

The front porch was ours so when we took a break (from all the fun things there were to do in Burlington) I sat out there and people watched. The guidebook was very helpful and we experienced great restaurants from Nancy and Andy’s recommendations. Find a couple days to visit this home and you’ll come away refreshed!"

The pictures don’t really show you that you are on this huge high cliff overlooking the bike path and the lake and mountains. The sunset is unbelievable. If you’re a cyclist, the bike path access is about 100 yards down the road. There’s a convenience store nearby. There’s a grocery store a couple blocks away. It’s only about a mile and a half from UVM‘s campus. Nancy is super nice and very meticulous in creating a clean and comfortable space. It’s small so just two people tops can be there.

Stayed a few nights","10/10 would recommend for anyone visiting Burlington --- even better if you're staying for more than one night :). The location is absolutely everything: it's a ~15-min walk to Church St., a ~5min walk or ~2min bike ride to the water/Burlington Greenway (miles and miles of bike trail along Lake Champlain) and the VIEW from the living room area of the apartment is breathtaking. I spent both mornings of my stay drinking coffee in one of the comfy lounge chairs, looking out over the water as the day began --- absolute bliss.
For bikers: I was able to bike all the way out to the Champlain Causeway, cross it, and come back almost without hitting roads from Nancy's place (Greenway --> a little neighborhood --> trail --> Causeway). It's a little over 20-miles door to door and was one of the most incredible experiences.
Nancy is so gracious and her apartment is fully outfitted with pretty much anything you'd need (and more than I needed for my brief stay!)-- I told her that she might need to kick me out! I appreciate the care that she's put into creating the lovey and functional space. The apartment shares an entrance with the ""main"" house where Nancy lives, but the living quarters are completely separate and I never felt as though I was infringing on her space. It's on a quiet street - which I really wanted - and also accessible by foot to everything downtown (if you're able to make that walk -- otherwise, it's an even quicker car ride!).
Maybe it's an 11/10 stay, after all :).
Stay here! You'll be charmed."

Be sure to try to be there by sunset to see the view. We would definitely stay there again. Thank you Nancy for an enjoyable stay.

Stayed one night","My partner and I were only in Burlington for an evening; however, the location of Nancy’s place was ideal. The apartment is quaint and has a kitchenette, if needed. We really enjoyed drinking our morning coffee & tea in the backyard and soaking up the view. Nancy was attentive and kind. It’s a beautiful, cozy stay."

On top of it, Nancy is a true host. As many Airbnbs move towards self-check in with hosts living off-site, it’s a refreshing reminder of the origins of this platform to connect people to each other. Nancy welcomed us with great enthusiasm and we enjoyed our chats with her through the stay. Thank you Nancy for the gift of your beautiful home and spirit during our time with you!!"

It is right on the lake front yet only about a 15 minute walk into town and very quiet at night so good for sleeping. The garden is beautiful and there are lots of seating options which we enjoyed for eating our dinner outside in the evenings. The house is very well equipped for cooking your own meals which we recommend because there is an abundance of organic produce grown in the area that you can buy at farmstands, markets and local stores. Super comfortable bed and arm chairs. Nancy is an attentive and caring host. No hesitation in recommending her place. I'd be back in a flash but I live in Australia!"

The apartment is charming, cozy and has all the amenities you need for a comfortable stay. The location is unbeatable and a quick stroll from Burlington's amenities. We stayed here for 3 weeks and enjoyed every second, especially the sunset overlooking the lake :) Nancy is also a wonderful hostess to be our privacy with the right sense of privacy.
Unbeatable and that's why we'll come back for sure;))

Stayed one night","It was super easy to contact and stay in communication with Nancy. She even met me as I pulled up to her home. There is a big, well-appointed kitchenette that I didn't use for my short trip, but I can see it working beautifully for anyone who needs/wants to make their own meals, or save some money and limit the number of times they dine out. I am super picky about how soft I love my sheets to be, and hers were delicious. It was a super hot weekend, so I was thrilled that she had two window-A/C's running, in opposite windows of the space, when I arrived. I felt blessed to be able to sit outside, in the evening, and look out onto the grandeur that is Lake Champlain. (Nancy had bug-juice for those who need it)."

Stayed a few nights",This was a fairly pleasant stay for the 3 nights my boyfriend and I stayed. The location is convenient and having a private kitchen and bathroom is always a plus for AirBnbs. However the garbage and recycling bins were very small. We ran out of room to dispose of our garbage and had to purchase garbage bags at a nearby target as there are no extra bags provided. There is also no where on the property to dispose of our garbage which we found a little odd. Also an extra set of towels for the 3 nights would’ve been appreciated. Parking is a little inconvenient as there were at least always 20 cars parked on the street (at least that was our case). Justin is a very responsive and friendly host which is always nice. I would give a 3.5 as 3 seems low but I’m not sure I would rate it a 4.

Stayed a few nights","This is a great little space to stay! Justin is a very responsive host to answer any questions or give recommendations. The bed is super comfy and plenty of extra blankets and towels are provided. The bathroom is perfect size- not too big or small- and the water pressure in the shower is great. There is an adjustable thermostat in the room which works great and lets you get warm and cozy in the cold Vermont winter. The off street parking in the driveway is so easy and convenient. The television has Comcast, which is nice because you can watch the local news. The apartment is very well located- walking distance to a couple of corner stores and a market with everything you need. This Airbnb is also very very clean upon arrival- no dirt or dust anywhere, and really clean towels and blankets. I would definitely stay at Justin's place again and HIGHLY recommend it."

His place is a quick jaunt to the UVM campus as well as downtown, and was quiet and peaceful in the evening. Justin's place itself is just perfect - everything was very clean, and for 2 people like my husband and I - we needed nothing else. He was the consummate host - thinking ahead and keeping coffee, cream (much needed in the AM!) as well as sparkling water and a little local beer too, ready for us in the fridge. We hope to be visiting Justin at his beautiful place a few more times in the next years as we explore Burlington. He's an incredibly responsive, kind and thoughtful host."

Stayed a few nights","Perfect spot for the price for 1 person (or a couple) if you don't plan on spending too much time in the room. I came to Burlington to ski and go out to bars/restaurants and this suited my needs well. Small place with a kitchen but no real table or anywhere to eat, which was fine for me as I mainly used the kitchen for a quick breakfast before skiing. Parking included but still a walkable location. Host was very responsive. Space was clean. Thanks Justin!"

Stayed one night","The room was really nice and well situated. The whole stay would have been perfect if it hadn’t been for our rude awakening. We woke up to the sound of our car in the process of being towed. As we went to intercept them and pay the fine (50$), the agent in charge of towing told us that a man from the same address that we were staying at, called the towing company on us instead of coming to knock on our door (right next to them) and ask us to move it. Funnily enough the instructions on their reservation said that “on and off parking are available”. We weren’t blocking any driveways and made sure of it as we were parking. When I sent them a message, we were met with excuses. We did not know the Burlington parking laws and that’s on us, but the way they handled it was very far from the New England charm that we had been greeted with everywhere else.
If you’re looking for a well situated room come here, just make sure that you come by foot or leave your car as far away as possible."

For thanksgiving, we then walked all the way to the causeway. It was cold. We did it again on another day so beautiful it was. We also walked to the RedRock park.
We were always tired and very happy to come home.

Stayed one night","This is a modern, impact, and fully equipped space! The friendly and responsive hosts incorporated the quaint and elegant touches of the house (like the pretty French doors, antique armoire, and wood floors) with the thoroughly up-to-date kitchen, living, room, bath, and super comfortable bed. The porch and outdoor space was perfect on a summer evening. Highly recommend! Quick walk into town and views of the lake."

We really liked the screen porch for relaxing in the evenings. The hosts were immediately responsive when a small issue occurred. They had the problem solved within a 1/2 hour.

More importantly to us, it was close to everything and we didn’t need to take the car once. There are great restaurants and shops nearby and Church Street has been built up a lot over the past couple of years. We loved shopping around and popping indoors when we needed to warm up. Even with two days, we didn’t get to all of the shops and there were a lot of places we still want to try for food. We would definitely stay there again."

Stayed a few nights","Laurie and Mark's place was just perfect for my recent trip to Burlington. It is really conveniently located to everything. Not only is the apartment darling and exquisitely appointed, but the tenants in the other half of the building are quiet and really friendly. This was not a pleasure trip (medical emergency) and Laurie was in close touch to make sure we had everything we needed. So kind. We'll be back to Burlington for sure for more relaxing occasions, and we can't wait to return to Laurie and Mark's place!"

With a central location you are in walking distance to everything downtown; with a perfect bungalow to retreat to at the end of your day of adventuring. Laurie and Mark made us feel very welcome and were incredibly communicative and accommodating our entire stay. I could not recommend this place enough, we will be back very soon for another stay!"

Stayed a few nights","Laurie and Mark were kind, helpful and responsive hosts. With detailed directions, self-check in was a breeze and the personal parking space in the driveway ideal. After a long drive and cold temps, we were so comforted that the heat was turned on for us! As a Superhost myself, I appreciated the finer details of their apartment and valued the organization and cleanliness of the space. It was immaculate! Not only was it clean, it was equipped with everything you need and nothing you don't! The bedding was comfortable, as were the bath towels, and the Keurig (with coffee pods) and gas fireplace were icing on the cake. Laurie had given us great ideas on places to frequent and EVERYTHING was in walking distance! We'll be back again and also hope to host (and spoil) Laurie and Mark at out Boston Airbnb someday."

They have a strong internet connection and because of the convenience to downtown, I was able to pop out for coffee, lunch and shopping throughout my day. The best part was the cozy gas fireplace on the super cold days."

Although it’s a small one bedroom apartment, there is plenty of space for 1-2 people and it has absolutely everything you could possibly need. It’s warm and cozy and very nicely decorated. I will definitely be back!"

L&M thought of many small touches that make a difference to a guest, and they were greatly appreciated! Dark roast coffee, sparkling water, the air purifier, selection of snacks and chocolates, even a small collection of wires and chords if you forgot them at home. The apartment was also nicely located, and we were able to see Burlington by walking, and didn't use the car again until we left. Great visit to Burlington, and I would highly recommend!"

Stayed one night","Great location, quiet neighborhood. Apt has been renovated with many updated appliances. BUT:
1. Confined, small space. Apt. is okay for one or two adults, not children or pets.
2. Kitchen actively discourages any cooking. No kitchen table or chairs.
3. Missing a toaster and an coffeemaker for coffee drinkers.
4. TV ROKU if you want to see standard TV programs you need to subscribe to a streaming service. Only thing available is CBS NEWS or old programs with multiple ads.
5. Very little air movement. Temperature and humidity eased somewhat by fan."
