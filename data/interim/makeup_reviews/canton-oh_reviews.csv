Stayed with kids","A clean, modern, and surprisingly spacious for a small house. It was cleaned immaculately and the furniture and beds are very comfortable. The kitchen had the basics stocked well. We especially appreciated that it was stocked with coffee and coffee filters ;). The football fields (and HOF) is a block and a half away; took 5 minutes to walk to our kids' soccer games. Selfishly, I didn't want to write a positive review because we hope to use the place again in the future and don't want others taking it!"

Stayed with kids","This was our first stay at an airbnb and it exceeded my expectations. We arrived a little early, and we could have waited for check in time but was told we could check in then, thank you for that. The home was very nice, clean and well put together. Beds were comfy and we enjoyed playing pool. This was also my 2 year old twins first time being out of state and away from home, which made me nervous because I had no idea how they would react. But they did pretty good, loved all the space to play; had to put a few things up so they wouldn't break it. But our overall experience was very nice. If we were ever to go back, we would pick here again.🙂"

Stayed over a week","We needed a place to stay for a month while our house was under construction, and we were fortunate to find Andrea’s listing. Pros: close to everything in North Canton and the Belden area, quiet and safe neighborhood, fantastic water pressure in the shower, easy parking, amenities provided- sheets, towels, coffee maker, etc.
Things that could be improved: the bed is more of a full size than a queen, the exhaust fan in the bathroom did not work, laundry in the basement costs .75 per load but the dryer needs a few cycles to dry clothes.
Overall, we were happy with the stay and the communication from Andrea throughout our time there. It is a great location if you are coming into the Canton area and you want to be close to everything."

The ad description is accurate.
The kitchen was equipped for simple meals.
Efficient Host
Clean and Safe
Great Sofa and TV
Great Shower
Great WiFi
The washer and dryer are in the basement. Old but Sturdy. 75 cents to wash 75 cents to dry. But the dryer
took 3 cycles. I went to a laundry matt next time. I did not mention this to Andrea.
All in All, it was lovely and worth the money. I will stay there again when we are back in the area."

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I really enjoyed our stay. Everything was neat, clean, and exactly like the pictures. We loved Andrea's responsiveness and patience with us as we are still airbnb newbies :) The added touches made it easy for us to feel comfortable. Andrea has made everything very convenient from the toiletries to the coffee and creamer that's waiting for you as you enter the kitchen (coffee lover here). The personal hygiene kit also came in handy as my husband left his body wash and lotion by accident (and didn't want to smell like a delicate flower, as he said...lol). Thank you for a very wonderful stay. We will definitely be back :)"

Stayed a few nights",Staying here was amazing! My fiancé and I are both originally from Ohio but now live in NC. We’ve been searching for our own place to stay when we come home ( which is about 2-3 times a year ) and i am so happy we stumbled across andrea’s place!! The communication with her and her friendliness is honestly unbeatable. The apartment itself was amazingly clean and well decorated. As soon as we walked in it had the most amazing citrus smell which was literally to die for. The apartment complex itself was extremely quiet and it was hard to believe anyone was actually there which is awesome. Check in and check out were such an easy time thanks to andrea and I’m so thankful to have gotten to stay with her this weekend while i was home celebrating my baby shower. I cant wait to stay with andrea again!

This was my first time dealing with Airbnb and I will never rent another hotel or motel again. Andrea was a delight of Simplicity to deal with. I didn't have to sit in the lobby while reservations were dealt with. It was overall an excellent experience. I will be staying here again if available or looking to rent anything else that Andrea has a vacancy on. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for comfort and relaxation.

Stayed a few nights","We booked our stay in May before there were any reviews of the place and GOODNESS am I glad we took the leap. Everything about this place is perfect. Plenty of room for 3, we brought our own air mattress just in case but slept on the couch with no issue and didn't even bother with the air mattress. GREAT location, and as three women we felt very safe the entire time and it was a quiet place not a lot of neighbor noise. We were there for the Pro Football Hall of Fame Enshrinements and it was about 10 minutes from everywhere we wanted to be and it was so nice to fall into bed in a cozy home instead of a hotel room at the end of our long days. Our only complaint we had was that our exhausted bodies had to climb stairs at the end of the day, which was our on fault for going so hard! :) But we seriously wouldn't of had it any other way. Andrea was quick to respond anytime I had a question and we were even able to check in early! Everything was clean, we made our own food and everything we needed was in the kitchen utensil wise. We will be back for future enshrinements and this will be the FIRST place we check. Seriously, if you're looking for a place to stay in Canton - stop looking THIS is the place to be!!"

Stayed over a week","This place is OK. There are pros (cheaper than the rest, located near where I needed to be and accessible, hosts do their best to provide) but there are also some cons. First, expect to hear anything your neighbors do, paper thin walls are an understatement. Don't even bother doing laundry in the shared public laundry. It's coin fed (hosts provide enough change for two loads) but the machines are from the 80s. Your clothes don't really get clean and they definitely do not get dry. I felt like I was in a 3rd world country with my clothes hanging all over the apt so they could air dry after two cycles in the dryer that failed to dry them. There is awesome water pressure but the drains for the sinks, well they don't drain. I communicated this and getting it fixed must have got lost in the shuffle. To be fair I wasn't super proactive about it as I was rarely at the apt due to work, but it was never followed up with by the hosts either. The hosts did their best to have the apt nicely decorated, but it's an old apartment and the overkill on airfresheners were there for a reason. For those who like elongated toilet bowls, this isn't your place. Probably fine for a female, men not so much. Would I stay here again? Yes. It was the cheapest place closest to where I needed to be. However, If there was something a bit nicer for a little more, I'd probably make the jump. I never felt in danger and neighbors seemed friendly enough. Age old adage of you get what you pay for is valid here."

We loved the house - it a great living space and kitchen, fun game room, and a nice deck. We also loved the fenced in backyard for our dog to run around and play. The house was about 30 mins away from Cuyahoga Valley NP, which was so convenient. We spent an amazing day hanging out on the deck, watching the eclipse, cooking dinner, and playing ping pong. The house felt like home and was such a good place to spend quality time with family (including pets). If you’re in the area with pets, I highly recommend you go to the Doodle Drive-in for a meal. Great food (for humans and pets) and such a fun place!"

Stayed a few nights","Thank you for sharing your Airbnb with us! We took a short trip to Ohio to visit our daughter, son in law and granddaughter over new years weekend. We absolutely loved the house, everything was perfect for what we needed - a large enough space for those of us who had traveled to Ohio and for when our daughter & her family came over to visit. My granddaughter had an absolutely amazing time crawling around the large living room, chasing me around the kitchen table and playing with her gifts we brought her. We all spent the weekend laughing & smiling, making wonderful memories! We stayed in for the majority of the time we were there, chatting, watching movies and having an all around relaxing time.
The game room was perfect for our kids (all adults) They had space to spend time visiting with their sister and brother in law while myself and my husband (Grandma & PawPaw) got to play with our granddaughter.
Wonderful time! We will definitely be staying at your Airbnb during future visits!"

I expect those will not be issues in the future. Overall, we would consider and recommend this place again if we’re back in that area."

Stayed with a pet","Fantastic place to stay! We enjoyed our extended stay at this location while work was being done on our home. They had everything we needed. The backyard was spacious and well enjoyed by our daughter and dogs. The patio was so nice to walk out to. We did lots of grilling!
The rooms are small but comfortable and uncluttered. The kitchen had everything you’d need. The basement was a fun space for movie nights with our daughter and she enjoyed many of the games the host provided. The home was very clean, has a great location and is a quiet neighborhood with friendly neighbors. The Happy Hideaway was responsive to the concerns we had and were great hosts. I would recommend this place to anyone!"

Stayed with a pet","This was our first Airbnb rental. We were impressed with the prompt and even proactive communication we experienced. Much less stress than the beach rentals we have had over the years with other companies. We appreciated the set up of the house -- inside and out. Clean comfortable seating in living and kitchen areas. Fenced in backyard perfect for our dog. We were so happy to find such accommodations. We did not need restaurants and entertainment, but we appreciated the info provided about local highlights. Kitchen appliances were great. Clear directions about owner expectations for check-in and check-out. We would definitely consider renting this home for future visits to Ohio. Thank you!"

Plenty of things to do in such a close distance to the home and if you want to stay in you have the big backyard and grill and they provide you with literally everything you could possibly need while there, there was only two of us but there’s so much room for many more! The neighbors were also so sweet!Would love to come back!"

The location is wonderful, close to a park and lots of places to walk our dog. The beds were comfortable, everything was very clean and organized, the home was well appointed. We had a few minor issues that can happen with any rental, such as a fan that broke while we were there. The rental company was quick and responsive to offer support . We had a really great experience. We loved it and will stay again when we are in town."

Safety was never a concern; we felt secure throughout our stay. However, the only drawback we encountered was the low water pressure in the showers, accompanied by a strong sulfur smell.

Stayed with a pet","Awesome home! We were in town to watch our son play lacrosse at WU. Being a large family, this place was perfect for us. Most of our kids are adults now and all 9 of us fit comfortably and had a great time. It is beautifully decorated, great beds and pillows, lots of space, gorgeous bathrooms with great water pressure, everything you need. Hosts are quick to respond. Unfortunately, it rained so we couldn’t enjoy the outside but hopefully, next time we can use the decks and fire pit. It all looked lovely. The house was immaculate and had such nice touches such as family games, children books, coffee beans, lots of throw blankets and 4 very comfy couches. Love that we were able to bring our labradoodle with us too! The gravel parking area just past the house has a walkway and steps to the house so it is very convenient. We came from PA and some of our kids came from NC, all of us had the best time together! So happy to find this home and we will be back again!"

Stayed with kids","🚩🚩🚩Be aware‼️
This host looks for every little thing to charge you with extra fees after checkout.
We were accused for damaging the marble floor.
They claimed that we broke their policy of having an event or party but they confirmed and ok with us having 7 kids. We only needed the extra space for our friends visiting from out of state.
They found some broken balloons and claimed that we left condoms everywhere.
They also found some cookie clumps and
some confetti papers. I would’ve gladly cleaned up if there were basic cleaning supplies for guests to use.
If I’ve not contacted the Airbnb I would’ve been charged $310.
After investigation They took $210 off because they found out that they were WRONG and lying about what they accused us of.
Still they charged me $55 for some cookie crumbs and pieces of paper!
I’ve been using Airbnb for years and this was by far the worst experience I have ever had. The amount of stress these owners caused us the past few weeks is insane."

Stayed with kids","Thank you to Kylee & Greg for an amazing stay! The place was super cute & had everything we needed for our stay.
Kylee was super responsive to my messages and any needs we had. She even offered a later check out when I asked if we could extend for 30 minutes, giving us until 1 pm instead of 1130 ☺️ Their welcome brochure had some great suggestions for food, coffee & things to do. We went to the Akron Zoo which was great for our littles as it is a smaller zoo.
I will say that the entrance (particularly the steps) are something to note. They are steep with narrow treads, which can be troublesome with young kids. Ours are currently 2 & 4 so they needed a bit of assistance going up & down. This is not meant to be a negative remark of the space, just noting for future renters."

Stayed with kids","Quiet neighborhood just minutes away from everything we traveled to Canton to do. The home is in a very nice area and close to shopping and restaurants. It’s a bit dated, but has everything you need for a nice getaway, with the exception of the modern convenience of having tvs in every room. Only one of the 3 bedrooms have a tv which is a challenge when traveling with tweens/teens, but our biggest complaint is the restricted access to the front door that poses a fire hazard. The front door was completely inaccessible.
Pull chain on ceiling fan in bedroom on front side of house worked once we we arrived, but didn’t after that
You have to push the handle on the toilet all the way up otherwise it just continues to run.
None of the minor inconveniences were too much of an imposition. We actually really enjoyed our stay and would recommend the property, but we wanted to make note of the minor issues we encountered so yo can make your housing decision based on our full disclosure."

Stayed a few nights","The football decorations here are amazing. The entrance to the Pro Football Hall of Fame is literally a football field away, no need to drive and park. Unfortunately, the hosts chose to lock the second floor door during our stay so the four bedroom house became a two bedroom house. The two of us guests weren't planning to use those upper bedrooms but being locked out felt really crappy. Also, the hosts have front and rear security cameras which they monitor to see how many people are going in and out. Creepy. I didn't feel I could invite my cousins over for lunch because the hosts might charge me an extra $20 per person. I can understand that the hosts have had problems with unexpected guests packing into the place but the answer isn't to treat all guests with suspicion."

The only negative that we had is the owners decided to let people pay to park on the property for the USFL game. I feel like when you are renting the house/property for the weekend, this should not happen or at very least should be presented to the renters as an option if they would mind this happening or not. That was not the case in this situation. Other than the parking situation, everything else was very nice and we enjoyed our stay."

Additionally, even with the construction it was only a 10 minute walk to the hall of fame! Additionally, restaurants, grocery stores and other things to do are all within a 3 Mike radius (10 minute drive) of the house. I’d highly recommend the house for your family to stay!"

The house was maybe a 2 min drive to the fields and provided a nice place to warm up after the games. The beds were very comfortable and we loved the decor. We didn’t use the washer/dryer, but it was good to have just in case. The teenagers loved having the upstairs to themselves. The owners are wonderful—my son didn’t realize he was locking the lock to the upstairs. Shelly was very responsive, helpful, and understanding. We will definitely return if we have another tournament in the area."

It would have taken longer to get in our car and drive to the HOF. Everything else was literally a very short drive away. Neighborhood was peaceful. There is construction going on around the stadium but it did not bother us one bit when we were inside.
The house had everything we needed and more; very spacious for our group of five; beds were very comfortable; and, everyone loved having their own space at the end of the evening. Garden room and outside sitting area were a definite plus.
Communication was great from the time I booked the house and throughout our stay. Fabulous hosts!"

There are repairs that really should be addressed like the hole in the floor outside of the shower and the shower connection to switch over, the tub water keeps running while you take a shower. Been to a few air bnbs near the same price and they were in much better condition. Either should reduce price or improve overall stay."

Enclosed back porch was an unexpected bonus and nice for sitting outside in the evenings and watching fireflies. Two sleeping areas upstairs and two downstairs would make it nice for two families staying together. It was just four of us, so we had plenty of space. Kim was very helpful and quickly turned down the thermostat for us when we asked."

The space was exactly as promised. Clean and close to the HOF. We loved the washer and dryer! And plenty of towels to go around. Cute little single serve Keurig and plenty of pods. The upstairs fuzzy blankets were a huge hit. In fact, we looked for a tag in order to buy one for our home - sadly, no tag :(
All in all, a good place to in a good location. Would recommend.
Thanks for your patience! We appreciated it."

Group trip","When booking this home, you will get the NFL feel. It is as stated, right across from the NFL Hall of Fame. We walked and it took us 4 minutes. The house is awesome and cozy. Although we were only there for one night, as it was a stop on our way to South Bend, IN to watch the UVA/ND football game, we would have stayed longer if we could have. If you are planning on staying here for the Hall of Fame game, or just touring the city, make sure you check this place out."

Everything was just perfect, newly and tastefully decorated, comfy beds and a quiet location. And wonderful laundry equipment; as we are touring from England this was invaluable. We thank Kim so much and just wished we could have stayed longer - well, we'll be back next time we visit the family you can be sure!"

Stayed one night","House is nice, clean and within walking distance of the Pro Football HOF. Outside of a gas station, there isn't anything else within walking distance, so expect to drive or taxi. Kim is a great host and very responsive. We had a little trouble getting in, due to us arriving early, but Kim was able to help us out and let us in remotely in minutes.
It appears the neighborhood is getting ready to be revamped, as many houses around were vacant, some with boarded up windows. It didn't seem unsafe or anything like that, but thought it should be mentioned.
Again, Kim was great throughout and I would definitely stay again!"

Just 10 ish minutes from the fields. TV’s in both bedrooms were a plus as well as mirror because 5 people with 1 bathroom was chaotic at times! Beds were firm and the kitchen was missing a few items (measuring spoons and a cutting board) nothing that impacted our stay! Coin Laundry in the basement was also helpful!

Judy's place is perfect for us. This is our first stay and everything about is was perfect for our needs. In fact, we didn't mind the lack of a washing machine and dryer (helpfully, Judy provides a laundry basket) because our daughter has those. Your mileage may vary but if comfort and style are valuable to you, this is your place."

The location is very close to the interstate and literally a hundred different restaurants. The house itself is very private. It’s roomy with a nice deck in the back. Judy provided drinks and snacks and was very prompt about answering any questions I had. If I had to come up with a complaint, it was that she had Pepsi in the fridge, and no Coke. Can’t have everything though,lol."

The house was very clean and spacious. We loved the sunroom! Just wish it would have been warmer to enjoy the huge deck. I stayed in the guest room and must say the bed is extremely squeaky. Judy had the fridge stocked with lots of drink options and plenty of snacks on the counter. She even left us a bottle of wine to enjoy! Thanks for a great stay!

Stayed a few nights","Judy is the hostess with the mostest. She has provided a great experience for myself and my husband during our stay in Canton, OH. From the littlest detail to the enormous hospitality, you have to stay at Judy's during your next stay in Canton. We loved the generous supply of drinks in the refrigerator, the snacks, chocolates, and coffee selections. The house is pristine and clean down to every nook and cranny. Judy's house is very close to everything we needed. My husband is a native of Canton and we were well acquainted with Belden Village and all the great restaurants in the area. When we arrived, Judy was wiping off the steps to ensure we didn't slip from the rain. Now that is going above and beyond the call of duty.
thanks again Judy, we will most definitely be back to your place the next time we come to Canton (which is an annual event for us)."

Stayed a few nights","We travel, frequently, and started using platforms, like AirBnB, and others, a few years ago. I carefully vet potential properties, as my standards are high. In all of that time, we have never been privileged to have stayed in a more immaculate private home, than this! It was astounding! From the very first contact, Judy was warm, and communicating. Her home is a spacious, mature home which has been sensitively updated. The decor is warm, and inviting, with plenty of comfy chairs, and gathering spaces. There is a large, inviting deck just off of the sun room, which doubles as a TV room. There are ceiling fans, throughout, which assure that the ample air conditioning gets evenly distributed. If you are musically talented, please bring sheet music, as there is a well tuned baby grand piano, in the living room! There are two bedrooms, the master bedroom featuring a large, lovely sitting room. The bathroom may be accessed, directly from the master suite, and from the hallway, directly across from the second bedroom. That bathroom has been modernized, and offers a nice, deep, bathtub/shower combination, and there are no end of thirsty towels available. Here, as in all areas of the home, there is a wide array of useful guest amenities, in the form of nice smelling shampoos, body washes and toothpaste, among them. That generous spirit carries through, to the well appointed kitchen, where we were pleasantly surprised to see a refrigerator VERY GENEROUSLY stocked with many bottles of water, juices, teas and fresh half and half. There is a Keurig coffee machine, and many pods, of several different types provided. The snack basket is not to be missed! There are dozens of personally sized selections, attractively displayed. Judy, and a friend, graciously met us, upon arrival, after staying in contact with us while we were on the road. She was so warm, that we felt an immediate affinity for her, and felt absolutely welcome, there. We were there, for a family wedding, and only spent two nights. It is a suitable space for long term rental. Let me assure you that, should we ever find ourselves returning, this will be the home we rent. The experience was extraordinary! Thank you, Judy"

It was nice after long days at work to come back to a place that truly felt like home. Judy is a wonderful lady and she was very responsive to all of my inquiries. The house is located in a beautiful neighborhood that is quiet and picturesque but it’s super close to the grocery store, shopping, dining and major highway. Would highly recommend!"

Judy is not at all intrusive, but was incredibly quick and effective at responding when we had a query.

This home is located across the street from a public golf course which provides a beautiful view out the front window. The location is only about three minutes from Belden Village shopping mall which has a gigantic amount of restaurants in this large shopping complex.

Stayed a few nights","My weekend at Judy's place really set the bar very high for me for my first Airbnb experience. Before I arrived she answered any and all questions I asked. We set a time to meet for me to check in and she was at her house waiting for me. When I arrived she greeted me and when I walked in her home, I felt a sense of calmness, peace and rejuvenation that you could never get at a 5 start hotel.
When me and my fiancé arrived, she gave us a tour of her place and everything was laid out perfectly. You could tell she thought of everything a potential guest would want and need. Judy made us feel at home so much so that I truthfully did not want to leave. Her place was pristine and the floor plans were excellent! I am very particular when it comes to the bathroom and bedding and her bathroom was spacious and clean and her beds were extremely comfortable! Every area of her house had meaning but gave off the same energy, peace and comfort!
Judy also took the time to provide us with resources regarding things to do and restaurants to visit in the area. I left them all there for future guests, so you're welcome, lol! If you love to be outside you can relax on her beautiful front porch and feel that nice breeze or hang out on the deck in the back. The neighborhood is very quiet!
During our stay she checked on us one time to make sure we were ok. Enough to know she cared and not too much to be overbearing like some people can be. On the check out day she wasn't a stickler for the time I needed to be out so there was no rush. We had access to everything in her home and even had beverages and snacks to consume during our entire stay. My 12 year old son even came to stay one night and he was throughly impressed and got the ""sleep of his life.""
I could go on and on because good service is hard to come by these days! Hospitality as a whole was above average and I am absolutely coming back before the year concludes.
Judy thank you very much for everything and we shall see you again very soon!
-God Bless"

Stayed a few nights","My husband and I have stayed in 18+ different airbnbs, but this was definitely in the top 3 for us! Marla's little house is adorable, cozy, and an overall gem! The kitchen is well stocked, linens were super fresh and soft, and we felt right at home. The bed was SO comfy and that is always a huge concern for us due to having multiple stays where the beds haven't been the greatest at other airbnbs. My biggest compliment would be how SQUEAKY CLEAN the home is. It smells so fresh and clean when you walk in, which we loved! We would absolutely stay with Marla again if we are in town in the future!"

I didn't have time to enjoy the patio but it was rather large and I was able to leave some things out there to make space in my car. Lots of TV to watch. I have been places with very few channels and when you have a teenager who just lost everything Tv is just what you need.

We plan to come back the next time we visit the area. Thank you, Marla!"

Marla does a great leading up to your stay with messaging & communication.
Sometimes Air BNB is slow in getting messaging across, I didn’t always see messages coming into my message box, and my question on recycling did not get answered by the host (which just decided to do the recycling ourself since we didn’t get an answer on the question.)
Great place, Great space, Gracious hostess (and host). 😌"

The bed was comfortably firm with linens perfect for the season. Couple that with the wonderful pillows and we didn't want to get out of bed! Water pressure in the shower was good. We appreciated the breakfast and toiletry items left for us and the many recommendations for area restaurants. The kitchen is stocked with utensils and pots/pans for simple cooking. Check in was easy with a door code and response time to our queries always timely. And bikes with helmets- wow! We hope to return!"

Stayed with kids","We loved staying here, the price was right and you could not ask for a better location. My husbands biggest concern with renting a home through Airbnb is finding a place to stay in a city your unfamiliar with and then finding out it’s not in the safest part of town. That was not the case with this rental and we could not be more grateful.
Marla was amazing and touched base with us throughout our stay to make sure we had a great experience. She had so many personal touches throughout the home that were great such as providing us with some drinks, non perishable breakfast items, hair dryer, etc. the home was located in a great area that was so close to everything it made our stay so much easier.
My husband and I were traveling with our 2 month son and it was such a huge comfort to have a home to eat our heads at night rather then a hotel. We were in town for a family wedding and some of our family spent almost $50.00 more to stay in a hotel with limited amenities while we got to stay in essentially a whole house for a little less. I couldn’t have picked a better place to stay and would definitely come back if I am in the area again."

Stayed with a pet","Beautiful, peaceful location with great views of nature to be enjoyed from the windows that extend the entire length of the back of the house. We are big fans of mid-century modern architecture, so this house was a special treat for us. The living space is very open and was perfect for two couples. Everything you need is on the first floor, which was a huge plus for my elderly parents who enjoy single story living. (even the walk-in shower)
We were in town on family business, but for vacationers Adrian has a nice book of local recommendations, and the Hall of Fame is close. The neighborhood is very quiet, and the neighbors are friendly. Grocery store, pharmacy, coffee shop and donuts are a short drive away.
Adrian is very responsive and helpful. Before our trip, she reached out with some helpful suggestions for us. While we there, a major storm knocked out power to the house for 24 hours and Adrian was quick to get us supplemental lighting. Would recommend Adrian's place!"

Stayed over a week","Our company sent a 2-man crew from Washington State to Canton for a 2-week project. Adrian's house was truly a home away from home for our guys, and I so appreciate her communication and hospitality during our stay. Absolutely beautiful property, nice safe neighborhood, quiet surroundings, and yet close to everything the crew needed.
The only downside, and this was completely OUR FAULT for not reading the listing closely, was the lack of laundry facilities and the hot tub not being available for guest use. I need to stress that both the amenities section and property description make this very clear to potential guests, but we missed it. Laundry wasn't a big deal, as Adrian recommended a nearby laundromat that served the guys well. Other than that, the property is stocked with everything you could possibly need.
If we work in the area again, I'll definitely reach out to Adrian first when researching housing options."

It was these thoughtful touches that really made it a 5 star experience! Thank you for a wonderful place to escape to."

Stayed a few nights","This has been the most enjoyable stay we have had in the Canton area. The neighborhood is nice and quiet. The suite was exceptionally clean, and had all the amenities one would need, and then some! Loyla was very responsive and courteous. We especially enjoyed sitting in front of the fireplace in the living room after a long day. We had a very peaceful rest each night. We highly recommend Serenity Hill, and cannot wait to return."

We were in Canton for a State Championship game at the Hall of Fame and it was nice to be out of the city, but a very easy drive to the stadium."

We stayed one night for a family birthday. We got in town early, asked for an early
check in and got it, which helped our short stay immensely!
The place was easy to find, instructions were spot on and we got right in. It was clean, organized and perfect for our needs.
We let Loyla know we were leaving early the next day, she told us what to do and what to expect. Again, perfect.
Highly recommended. We will be back!"

Stayed a few nights","The place was super clean which is always 1st on my list. Followed by a comfy bed ✔️.
The only thing I’d feel needs be advised to future guests, is the residents are early risers & you can hear this downstairs. Nothing rude or obnoxious. Just floors & whispers. We personally weren’t bothered by this. It is the first time we have slept under someone so it was more a surprise.
Overall we definitely recommend Loyola’s Place!!"

Stayed one night","I enjoyed staying in Loyla's space. It is clean, comfortable and quiet.
Serenity Hill is aptly named. I had a feeling of peace just stepping through the door.
The apartment is meticulously clean and spacious. It is decorated in muted, unfussy tones. Everything looks new and well-kept.
My hostess, Loyla, was easy to reach and responsive. She made me feel welcome and answered all my questions. Information about the apartment and the surrounding area was readily available upon my arrival.
The bed was especially comfortable. All the rooms were larger than expected, even the bathroom, which was a welcome surprise.
I would recommend Serenity Hill to travelers who need a quiet, safe, clean place to rest or sleep, or do some writing, or hanging out with friends or family. There are two comfortable couches in the living area (though I never turned on the TV in there).
The hosts are gracious and welcoming. Highly recommended!"

The hosts thought of everything to make our stay comfortable - coffee, grab n go snacks, stocked bathroom (make up wipes, shampoo/conditioner, lotion, etc.) and more. I found the place clean and cozy. It served our purposes well as our homebase during an event at Gervasi Winery over the weekend (less than 10 minute drive to the vineyard). They also accommodated our questions and coming and goings throughout our stay. Very friendly and gracious hosts!
Thank you again!"
