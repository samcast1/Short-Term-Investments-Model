Stayed with a pet",The house was perfect for our family (and dog) and we enjoyed our stay. The house was well stocked and very clean. The fenced in backyard and deck area was perfect for relaxing after a long day and letting our dog stretch her legs. Kelly was very responsive and checked on us during our stay to make sure we had everything we needed. We will absolutely stay here again whenever we are in the area!

Group trip","The first thing about Kelly's place is that it was immaculate. Kelly was so sweet to have bottled water and a sweet welcome note for us upon arrival. It is very obvious that she wants to ensure her guests have a wonderful stay. Great beds, hot water, soap, shampoo, conditioner, etc. What else could anyone ask for? The neighborhood felt safe and was very quiet. Would recommend this home and would stay again. Thank you Kelly for your hospitality."

Kelly had our favorite tea waiting for us upon arrival and was very responsive when we had questions about the house/area. We would absolutely stay again if we’re in MS!"

Stayed with a pet",Kelly is a gracious and responsive host. Her home is spotless and very well suplied. Normally I bring my own K-cups on trips however this time I totally forgot to pack them. I was so happy to see those little cups lined up next to the coffee maker:) The neighborhood is peaceful and in beautiful surroundings. The private and fenced yard was the highlight for the 2 doggies. We highly recommend Kelly's place :)

So many extra touches too… water bottles, coffee and toys for the dogs

Stayed with a pet","I can’t say enough good things about this home. The rooms are large, TV’s in each one, and a bathroom on each floor. The neighborhood is quiet and private but a 5 minute drive to many stores and restaurants. Very close to the base so perfect for incoming/outgoing military or their visiting families. And it’s very dog friendly! Our old girl loved running around the backyard chasing squirrels.
Kelly is an outstanding host. She responds within minutes, and is very helpful and kind.
Thank you, Kelly, for an amazing stay!"

Stayed a few nights","It’s not often that a property (and/or its management) exceeds expectations to the extent that Kelly’s did. This house has a more spacious feeling than we were expecting, and we really spread out. It’s a lovely house!
Also, in our experience, it’s unusual to find a home as well-equipped with flatscreen TVs (Roku-enabled or otherwise) unless you’re paying a lot more per night. Finally, I had to be alone for part of our time there, and I felt very safe. All around A+!"

The bed was incredibly comfortable, ensuring a restful night's sleep after a day's work. The kitchenette was well-equipped with all the essentials, allowing you to prepare simple meals and snacks. The bathroom was clean and stocked with fresh towels and toiletries, which was a thoughtful touch.
Location-wise, it was ideal. Situated in a quiet neighborhood, easy access to local cafes, restaurants, and shops.

Stayed one night","Stephanie was a great host and had an awesome place. Very cool bohemian style interior design in a cozy space. Everything was clean and orderly. Bed and furniture were very comfortable, I slept great.
Had a wide variety of reading material available. I particularly liked the magazines and pamphlets about the local region. Nice TV with all the major streaming services already downloaded onto it. As a game designer, my favorite part was the N64 with Super Mario 64. I’ve never seen that in an Airbnb before.
Stephanie also gave some good recommendations about where to take my father for his birthday dinner.
Great host, lovely rental, would stay here again."

Stayed a few nights","Stephanie’s place was amazing, nice, quite and tucked away, outside of the city but less than a 5 min drive to everything that you need. And getting to see the White tail deer at night and sometimes in the early morning was wonderful. Stephanie truly has a hidden gem that’s prefect for a one person stay or a couples get away.
But there are small things that would have made the stay even better than what it was. The place wasn’t as clean as it should have been. Not sure if it was the previous guest or the cleaning service she uses, but there was dog hair and long blonde and burette hair mostly in living room area. And water left in the dishwasher which wasn’t a big deal. Once the dishwasher was cycled again.
Overall it was amazing stay in a wonderful quite neighborhood and Stephanie was an amazing host.
Thanks for allow me to stay at your place and I look forward to the next time.

Stayed a few nights","Stephanie's place was a nice large room and bath, but nothing special.
Getting in late at night, it would have been nice to have an outside light turned on.
The bed was not stiff, firm, but it was hard. For my wife and me, it was uncomfortably hard.
My wife found one wash rag. We asked Stephanie about it. She replied there should be a stack under the counter. There was only one. No attempt was made to provide any rags. We found some at Walmart. Towels were frayed.
The thing that made me feel uncomfortable was the locking door. Stephanie was not there so it made me wonder who was on the other side of that door with access to our room, but we had no way to lock the door from our side.
The entry is on an incline that may be a problem for older clients.
It was not a magical place, but it was larger, quieter, and less expensive than a hotel room on game day. Stephanie was very quick to respond to any message. She is polite and a joy to work with."

Very nice, historic house that has been upgraded perfectly to feel right at home. Kitchen and bathroom had everything we needed, was able to buy groceries at the Walmart 5 minutes away, and wash dishes and clothes with ease just like we were at home.
The host was very responsive to our basic questions and made sure we knew if there was anything else we needed to not hesitate to ask.
Great overall experience, will definitely recommend to others and will certainly look to stay again in the future when in the area!"

I thought she cleaned it up as we were rushing to leave the next morning by 6am. We washed the dishes, put all of linens in the hamper, put all trash out, turned lights off, set thermostat to 70, put remotes on stands, and opened the blinds I tried to leave the house as close to the original condition. The host contacted me about the stain I apologized repeatedly and said I would replace it, I told her I'd come clean it or send the money, but my attempts went unanswered. If Mrs. Brettany reads this please accept my dearest apology and my lack of thoroughly checking my child's clean up obligations. Please forgive me and I will still replace it if needed. Other than that, definitely stay here. It's a gem! thanks"

Snacks and water was there and There were games to play as well. Brettany was very responsive and kind.

Check in and out was easy. Good communication. Great to have a parking space right there off street! Snacks and a couple bottles of water really helped before we had a chance to get to store.

This town has wonderful architecture and charm and it takes people like Brettany to nurture that! Well done!!!
Ps. I hope you dabble in other areas of the market. Flip some old homes! Create rental spaces for local families! You have what it takes to breath new life back into Columbus!"

Also there’s enough towels, dish soap, hand soap, toilet paper, etc. The beds, pillows, and linens are super soft and inviting too.

We have two toddlers and was able to move the desk from the office before our stay so we could put our toddlers in the room. We were able to fit a pack and play and a toddler bed in the office room. The place was close the downtown and river walk. The doors are a bit tricky to open and close. You will hear the train sounds and police sirens going off if your you’re a light a sleeper. Other than that, would recommend."

Stayed a few nights",Condo was very nice and clean. Doorknob on the bathroom just needs to be replaced. We thought we were locked in! The only thing we really disliked was that the neighbor was rude and harrassing us. She kept walking around the back as if she was watching us from the outside. She also told us to turn the music down at 730 ish which was just a speaker. She had her window up i guess to HEAR everything. Then as we were leaving she was sitting outside and said we were talking to loud when we were walking to our car. Oh yea and her cat paw prints were all on my car and i said nothing to her about it. I feel like she is just old and bitter and needs to stay inside! Other than that our stay was great!

We were very comfortable which is a must when staying so long with a baby. Everything you need is provided and we really enjoyed the little personal touches at check in such as bottled water and snacks as well as easy instructions for accessing the wifi and where to find different things in the apartment. Parking is really easy and the apartment is walking distance to shops and restaurants.
Brettany is so incredibly responsive and got back to us very quickly with issues and questions. We had several hiccups during our stay, some as a result of the building being old and some due to weather, Brettany was very on top of trying to resolve issues as quickly as possible."

Brettany was very accommodating and actually helped us out big-time because I originally only reserved for 5 weeks. We didn’t need much because she already stocked the place with everything you’d need, but if we did need something, she was quick to make sure it was taken care of. We were lucky enough to meet Brettany because she’s an amazing person. Regarding the apartment, it’s also a 10/10. There’s plenty of room inside and my wife loved how it was decorated. Again, it came with everything we needed for 2 months of living so it had EVERYTHING! The neighbors are super sweet and the location is perfect to downtown. My wife and I loved this stay. Thanks Brettany!!!!"

It was an ideal place for 2-4 people. My cousin and I enjoyed seeing the space, as we grew up in Columbus and shopped in the area below for years with our mothers and grandmothers. We hope to stay here again!"

Stayed with kids","This apartment (and Millie as host) is outstanding. If you are staying in Columbus, you are not going to beat this location (assuming you want to be in town). We had more than we needed and if we had needed anything extra, Millie was a text away. You have several restaurants/bars/stores within a block or so. It's also convenient if you are using Columbus as a base to head anywhere else in GTR. Beds were comfy, bathroom was lovely, kitchen was well-equipped, view was great, etc. We will definitely stay here again (or at the apartment across the hall that will have a patio). Do stay here if you want a great spot in Columbus! Thanks again, Millie!"

Mille and her husband were a total delight to meet. She even left little snacks for you to munch on. The stairs were the only negative for me. But once you opened the door to this little oasis, it was worth the climb."

Stayed about a week","Sage is a small but comfortable older home with all the modern conveniences needed for a quick visit or an extended stay. We did a longer stay with shorter stays before and after and always felt right at home. The house was just what we needed and perfectly located for us within a couple, walkable blocks of MUW. You can also easily walk to downtown and will see lots of historic houses on the way. The area is generally quiet, with the exception of the occasional trains which are a few blocks away and are part and parcel of being close to MUW. Vonnie is a wonderful host, very friendly, helpful and responsive. We would stay again if in the area and highly recommend."

We appreciated the privacy of a whole house, the proximity to MUW, and the convenient location in general. It is easy to get to downtown, restaurants, shopping, etc. Downtown and MUW are within easy walking distance. Especially for a longer term stay, the fully functional kitchen, washer/dryer, internet, TV, and security system were appreciated. Vonnie is a great host and wonderful to work with. She was very responsive to our needs, even installing blinds on the large kitchen window at our request and making a few other modifications that we suggested. Highly recommend both Vonnie and Sage!"

Instead of the bare minimum that we often find in our Airbnb rentals, there was plenty. Lots of towels, toilet tissue and even qtips and cotton on the bathroom counter. The coffee was great at the shop downstairs. I also had the most moist and delicious muffin from there waiting for me at check in. We had a fantastic belated anniversary weekend. Jody was the most friendly host. He made us feel like we were welcome and communicated better than any host so far. I wanted to stay! We will be back! Thanks Jody!"

An added gem was the coffee shop attached to the loft—the coffee was top-notch and the staff were exceptionally friendly, adding a lovely touch to our mornings.

The floors were super squishy and squeaky. The doors opened and closes extremely loud. We even got stuck inside one of the bedrooms. We had to go a purchase towels, washcloths, pots and pans. We were also unable to control the heat so we were uncomfortably hot for the majority of our stay. The lawn was covered with dead leaves. No garbage can in the bathrooms. We had to clean the bathrooms ourselves. Because we didn’t have any other options we had to make it work. But I would never book this home in its current condition again."

There were a few issues with the bathroom toilet leaking, the shower was really hard to turn off, the oven wouldn't turn off and the house was not clean to the expectations I have come to expect of an airbnb. My son was super excited to play the arcade game advertised but there was no power cord. Over all I would say the stay was just ""ok"". Not bad, but there were several issues I didn't expect to encounter."

The cabin is located in a quiet residential neighborhood only a few minutes from downtown Columbus. There were no problems with ingress and egress and convenient parking was provided.
Overall, if you are in need of a convenient, quiet space to get away for a few days give Al and Daphne’s cabin s try. We would gladly return should the occasion arise."

I’m not used to having meals and toiletries all there. The location is a little farther from downtown Columbus than others (if you care about that - I didn’t), but it’s still only 15 minutes away. Definitely worth a stay if you’re staying in the area."

Stayed one night","After our electricity went out, it was necessary to find a nice, cool place to stay. I looked on the Airbnb website & found one that sounded like a cozy lil home away from home that was in a quiet lil neighborhood away from the hustle & bustle of the noisy downtown area, but yet not too far away from the convenience of grocery stores, shopping centers & restaurants.
I was extremely grateful for them responding so quickly to our requests since the weather was so hot, humid & rainy.
We instantly fell in love with their quaint cozy lil home. It may have been just a tad bit mini in size, but it way exceeded our expectations of what Albert & Daphne had expressed in the description of their Airbnb home. They went above & beyond what one would expect when staying overnight away from home.
They offered everything imaginable in their Airbnb that would make you feel as if you were right at home. They offered you privacy if you wanted or their assistance if you needed them for anything.
It was extremely clean & had a full size stove, refrigerator, washer, dryer, a huge shower &
a queen sized bed.
Thank y’all for sharing your precious lil home with us! I would highly recommend this “ hidden lil gem” !! Daphne had it decorated SO cute !!
Thank y’all so much for that southern hospitality that we are so famous for here in the south !
You will be very pleasantly surprised & you will make every excuse imaginable to be able to get to go back there. 😍🥰🤩"

Stayed one night","Stopped at Albert and Daphne’s adorable cabin on a very long drive from New Orleans to New York. My route changed mid-trip, which is how I ended up at their cabin last-minute, but they were very accommodating about my late booking (and very understanding when I accidentally locked myself out at 10pm — make sure not to let the door close behind you unless you have the code on hand!)
I was able to do my laundry and make a quick dinner and got a great night’s sleep in the incredibly comfortable bed. Had my coffee on the porch in the morning, too! And all of the thoughtful touches — not least milk and breakfast and sweet treats in the fridge — really made my stay all the better."

Group trip","I cannot say enough about how blessed we were to find this listing. It fit our family perfectly, so much better than a hotel so we could spread out, cook, and feel like it was an extension of our own home. Karen is extremely hospitable, was accommodating to our needs, and this home has so many ""extra"" touches that demonstrates Karen's love for her guests. Karen owns a few Airbnb's in town and we would not hesitate to stay in any of these. I have not found anything in Columbus that compares to Karen's properties. Each day we traveled to our son's home to visit his family about 12 minutes away but this property in no way feels ""too far"" or ""out of the way"". We even did a big Kroger click list and had our groceries delivered on our first morning there. It is perfect and peaceful right on a golf course!"
