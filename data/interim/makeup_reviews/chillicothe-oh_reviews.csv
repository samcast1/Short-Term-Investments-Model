Stayed a few nights","Fantastic place and location. Pictures don't do it justice. It's one of those rare places that's actually better than the description. Would be nice if it had dedicated parking, but there's a free lot a block or so away if you can't find street parking, so it's workable. Very convenient and walkable to everything downtown."

Stayed a few nights","Stayed at The Principal for a week-long work trip, and thoroughly enjoyed our visit! The location can't be beat - we walked minutes (if that) to all local eateries. The place looks just like the pictures and was plenty spacious - there were 3 of us, and we never felt cramped in any way. It is a beautiful loft that has clearly been thoughtfully renovated and generously furnished. The beds were all very comfortable, there were plenty of extra linens, and the place was spotless when we arrived. The only thing I would note is that on the Friday/Saturday of our stay, the music from the bar below was very loud starting in the early evening. It didn't bother us much, but if you're considering coming with younger children, it may be an inconvenience. Otherwise, the hosts were fantastic and kindly helped us get a few packages delivered locally. We will definitely be staying here again on our next trip to Chillicothe!"

Settled right downtown and in the middle of so many restaurants and unique shops, this spot made for a great place to spend the weekend away. The location was perfect because there was so much to do within walking distance from the Townhome. If all of that wasn't enough, this Townhome is absolutely beautiful and modern, with all the amenities. You immediately feel so welcome when walking in to the main floor, this Townhome definitely has it all. Very much looking forward to staying at this location again in the future!"

The moment you step inside, you’re greeted by a captivating blend of modernity and style, creating an ambiance that exceeds expectations. The attention to detail is impeccable – from the sleek decor to the thoughtful design elements. Every corner of the space exudes a unique charm that goes beyond what the pictures can capture. It’s a testament to the host’s commitment to providing an exceptional experience. Moreover, the location couldn’t be more perfect. Whether you’re exploring the local attractions or simply enjoying the surroundings, you’re right where you want to be. It’s a hidden gem in Chillicothe, and I dare say, the best-kept secret in town."

Stayed a few nights","Really enjoyed our stay at the principal! The location was perfect, close to restaurants, breweries and some cute shops throughout the town. There is a bakery right next door, High Five Cakes that is supposed to have fabulous cinnamon rolls. We tried to get them one morning, but they are now a pre order item. I would recommend putting an order in before your visit to pick up one morning! We had some of their cupcakes and they were delicious! We had dinner one evening at the Old Canal Smoke house, we highly recommend it! Best meal we had during our visit!
The space itself was VERY clean and they did a fabulous job with the renovation! The bed in the master bedroom was very comfortable and the sheets were very soft. The makeup wipes were a nice touch along with the other toiletries in the master bath.
We will definitely stay here again while visiting Chillicothe!"

Stayed a few nights","This was a beautiful gem that is somewhat hidden on this retail street location. The place was a tastefully furnished townhouse in downtown Chillicothe. Amazing vaulted ceilings with hard wood floors. The bathrooms were luxurious. Within walking distance of coffee shops, local stores, pubs, and eateries. Immaculately clean. One small warning, the stairs in both the entry way and to the upper floor has many steps and is steep. I thought it would be difficult for my mother-in-law, but she made it up just fine. We loved this place! We will definitely return."

Stayed a few nights","We had the incredible privilege of staying at “The Principal” loft in Chillicothe for our rehearsal dinner and wedding weekend, and it was nothing short of magical ✨ Aubrey has curated an atmosphere of luxury and comfort that surpasses any expectation. The moment we stepped in, we were taken aback by the loft’s high-end design, rich brick walls, historic integrity, and wooden floors that perfectly complement the spacious, high-ceiling lofted layout. The bathroom felt like our private spa oasis, adding another layer of relaxation to our special occasion. Between its unbeatable location above the Old Capitol brewery in the heart of downtown and Aubrey’s warm and attentive hospitality, we couldn’t have asked for a better experience from the moment we opened the front door to the moment we locked up upon checkout. We’re already counting down the days until we can return. This is more than just a place to stay; it’s a memory we’ll cherish forever!!! Thank you!!! 🙏❤️"

The only thing that I was a bit disappointed in was they do not allow ANYBODY else in the air bnb; no friends, extended family etc.
I do understand why they do this, the place is so nice. But part of why I love air bnb is the ability to atleast have a friend or a family member over while you’re there. Again, minor inconvenience for an otherwise incredible place."

Everything was immaculate and very inviting. I will definitely stay again when I come back to Chillicothe!"

Stayed with kids","I am writing a review about a family staying here. This place is absolutely lovely!! We loved the location right in the downtown walking distance to so many things! We enjoyed our stay here immensely as a family.
The owner spared no expense in renovating this property, it has beautiful leather chairs, lovely custom cabinetry, high end appliances, and it's very tastefully decorated. The bathroom upstairs in the master is spa-like. Very relaxing! We have teenagers and a two-year-old. There are a few things I would consider if I was coming here with a young child. The Master suite is upstairs as well as a loft area with beautiful iron horizontal railing. It also has two long sets of staircases. If you have a child just learning to walk, or one that likes climbing, you may want to wait to enjoy this wonderful property!
Overall, it was an amazing experience. We had returned to Chillicothe after spending a weekend here last year. It's such a fun experience. The children love Grandpa Joe's candy store, seeing the 50th annual Tecumseh outdoor drama, I love Rost coffee, and the old canal smokehouse has some amazing food! We will be back, maybe we have to make it an annual event."

Such a cool idea! One of the best vacation rentals we’ve stayed in at The Principal Chillicothe. Right downtown close to all of the action and even had dive bar list for us!
Other highlights of our trip:
Hiking views of the cliffs of sandstone and shale that descend into gorgeous Paint Creek Gorge
Great local brews at The Pour House at Machinery Hall and Fifty West Brewing
Best meal I had in a while at Old Canal Smoke House
Fantastic production of Tecumseh Outdoor Drama, celebrating 50 years!
The Fort Collective: a community space with private offices, a coffee shop, and incubator business spaces

From the charming little town, to all the history of the town, and all of the cute shops and great food within a few feet of the front door makes this way more valuable than the price. I seriously was thinking on the way home how to decorate a space like this. From the make up towels to the extra pillows to the linens it’s just the most incredible place I’ve ever stayed and I have stayed at a lot of places. I visited the candy shop and had dinner at the hibachi place on the corner and it was so good. I also learned about the history of the building and was super excited to know everything about the area. I would come there again just to hang out because it’s so incredible. Who knew Chillicothe was such a cool town."

It is the perfect place for a weekend break. Everything worked well in terms of the locks, appliances, heat etc . Abby, one of the hosts, responded immediately to any questions. The town is very cute with good restaurants, at least two great local places for coffee, and many small shops (the book store and candy store were highlights!). There is also a great playground in walking distance and a quiet paved trail beside the river. Parking was easy too. It is definitely a wonderful place for a few days break. I highly recommend it!"

Everything was extremely clean (it is all brand new appliances, furniture, linens/towels, etc). Host was great with communicating ahead of the stay and during the stay. Host also had the place stocked with light refreshments such as coffee, popcorn, hot chocolate, etc which was a nice small addition. The nicest AirBnB I’ve experienced to date - and I’m honestly not sure how it could be topped!"

Stayed with kids","We were lucky to be some of the first guests at this amazing rental in the heart of Chillicothe. We used this as a home base while seeing Chillicothe and exploring the nearby area (Hocking Hills, day trips to Columbus, etc.). The apartment is expertly appointment, the bathrooms are amazing, and the bunk beds are the coolest bunk beds you'll ever see. The rental is right on the main drag of Chillicothe, thus you will expect some noise on weekend evenings (food truck generator, music in the brewery), but it never was a problem. The nearby restaurants, breweries, coffee shops, and more are all fantastic, and are a short walk away.
There is parking right in front of the rental, free on weekends and evenings, but sometimes in high demand (i.e. Fri and Sat nights). There's also a free parking lot, with free electric car charging, just a 2 minute walk away."

The apartment has the most beautiful old brick walls and a stunning modern kitchen that would be great for a large group. It had everything we could have wanted and more, incredible bathrooms, cool bunkbeds and popcorn for the kids and beer from the fun brewery downstairs for the adults! The host was incredibly responsive and access was the easiest I’ve ever seen. 
 
Locally we enjoyed the cute shops in downtown, the two great tap rooms right along Paint Street and getting out of Columbus for a few days to see the gorgeous fall colors in the rolling hills around Chillicothe.  
 
This place would provide the perfect weekend away for groups or families (with more amenities than home). We will definitely be back to The Principal!"

Stayed one night","THIS IS A MUST SEE! We loved our stay with Michelle. Stepping into her house is like stepping back in time. It is a pristine Victorian with modern flourishes. The house is very roomy, well equipped and has a gorgeous front porch and back yard. The neighbor is delightful, and so is the neighborhood. It is just a few blocks from a bakery that opened in the 1920s, and in the other direction is downtown Chillicothe. SUPER CUTE! Michelle has made the house so welcoming. We loved our stay. Parking was easy. There are a lot of steps to get to the front door, but there is a railing too. This was not just a place to stay it was an experience!"

Group trip","This is a beautifully restored home near the historic downtown area with several large bedrooms, and a nice sitting porch with a fire pit. It is near a busy road with truck traffic so there is some vehicle noise most of the day. On-street parking only, though it was pretty easy to find a space nearby, if not right in front. The kitchen is very small and only minimally outfitted but we were still able to cook a decent meal one night. The neighbors are quite close so if a dog is misbehaving it will be noticed. But overall a great value for what it delivers, and the host was extremely responsive."

It was surprisingly quiet at night even though it’s on a strip with a lot of cars coming by…and we stayed in the front bedroom on the side of the street! It was a great location for us as we visited family in Ray and drove to Springfield to see the total solar eclipse. Michelle is very responsive and even let me know that the cleaning crew found some of our groups belongings and she’s shipping them to us (we’re paying shipping, of course.) Highly encourage booking Michelle’s place!"

Group trip","What a great place!! I love this house and we felt right at home - one of my favorites to date. Very clean, beautifully decorated and some great amenities. One king bed, two bedrooms with queens and one bedroom with a twin. Nice kitchen easy to work in - I baked a pie and there was most of what you need and everything was clean and organized. Just loved it! We went to a Halloween play where Tecumseh drama usually is and a full day of hiking at Hocking Hills - close by for the play and about 40 minutes to the park. However Chillicothe has some great restaurants and shops that are all within walking distance so you really don’t need to leave unless you have something specific to do outside of town. We loved the doughnut place right down from the house - really tasty and we loved the restaurant in town for breakfast called the Coop. Highly recommend this beautiful home and I really want to go back!!"

She had notes all over about light switches, remotes etc. each bedroom was beautiful, looked like right out of a magazine. The dining room table was even set. It is a great location for visiting Chillicothe. She had a book with all kinds of recommendations for restaurants and things to do. All the streaming apps were on the TV even though we were raptor busy. We grew up here and were able to entertain a few classmates. This is definitely your go to place for visiting friends or going to CHS reunions and I will post it on our class website. So much better than getting multiple hotel rooms. I highly recommend and will stay here in the future."

The parking was a bit tricky but we found a spot. We will be sure to share this Chillicothe home with others we know as it is a great place to visit."

Stayed a few nights","This is an architecturally beautiful and very clean home. The hostess left a nice plate of treats and a welcome note. While we mostly enjoyed our stay, in fairness to you, the reader of this review and as a potential future guests, we feel compelled to provide full disclosure based on the listing and our own experience at the time. Unfortunately, the listing is inaccurate and/or misleading, in our opinion, based on our own experience and in part due to our own fault for making assumptions based on the listing's pictures and list of amenities.
1) The listing shows pictures of three bedrooms, while there are in fact only 2 for 4 guests, in only full-sized beds. The verbage does state 2 bedrooms & no indication of the size of these beds, other than the pictures. (Our own fault for not questioning the inconsistency between the pictures and the words.)
2) The listing says check-in at 3 PM, but we received a text while we were already mid-air in our flight that it was at 4 pm. (We were able to enter shortly after 3, and assume that the Ring doorbell allowed the hostess to see us & grant remote access. ) Please note that the listing indicates that it is on you as the guest to initiate contact with the hostess, which we did very early that morning.
2) The absolute biggest shock was that this place is apparently the owners' residence and that her two large and very sweet dogs were in the back yard! (There was a note from the hostess which said not to enter the area.) This is the area we had expected to be able to use per the listing... (barbecue, fire pit, etc.) We had envisioned sitting around the fire pit and barbecuing while visiting. We very much enjoyed the fire island on the front porch, but the busy traffic and smaller area was an issue.
3) Very minor inconsistencies, to us, included parking (on street vs on site, depending on where you read what...), availability of bicycles, availability of higher-end hair care products and availability of a blow-dryer.
It's really what matters to you, so what we found to be issues may not matter to you."

My only ""complaint"" is the size of the shower. The whole house is small (height wise) but the shower is very tiny and im only 5'2. If you are taller (my boyfrind is 6'2) you will have to bend down a little and be caredul to not hit your head, my boyfriend hit his getting out. I do wish there was a tv in the bedroom but not a big deal! I left something there and Tonya was more than happy to geab it and hangout to it for me till someone was able to get it! Overall our stay was great and we will definitely stay again."

There were a lot of little touches that showed her attention to detail (toothbrushes in the linen closet, soap samples from a local shop, snacks and to go cups for coffee). We really appreciated all of the thoughtfulness. One of the most appreciated aspects of our stay was how comfortable the bed was. You never know what you’re going to get with Airbnb (and I’ve slept on near-cement blocks). As a Chillicothe native, there were tons of menus to all of the local spots that represented the city well. Would totally book again."

Stayed a few nights","Tonya's little house is cozy, and totally adorable! The kitchen in particular is a marvel of ingenuity and creativity -- everything you could need, thoughtfully engineered into a small space.
Tonya has stocked Exit Way Out with so many thoughtful and generous touches for her guests: loads of historical guides and maps of Chillicothe and surrounding parks, a filled water filter pitcher in the fridge (and even a few frozen meals in the freezer, if you check in late and need dinner!), plenty of fluffy towels and a medicine chest in the bathroom, a wonderful showerhead and touch/tap lights in the shower, and a chest of drawers and plenty of hangers in the bedroom. It was so nice to have condiments in the fridge (ketchup, butter, etc.) so I didn't need to buy a pound of butter if I just needed a little.
Everything in the house worked well. Tonya was easy to communicate with, and ready to respond if I needed any help. Exit Way Out was a delightful place to stay!"

Only complaints i have, is if two people are looking to take a shower right after one another, you only have hot water for one person. Besides that and just waiting a couple hours after each shower, i would totally recommend this place!"

We personally LOVE squirrels so we laughed and thought it was super cool. We even took a pic with the one on the mantle 🐿️ lol. Giovanni’s near by was super tasty and is in walking distance from the place as well as the drive thru. Quiet, unique, welcoming and simple. I personally felt safe there. We sat on the front porch and the sky was so clear and we saw the meteor showers. Thanks for the stay. If I ever drive through the sticks again I’d stay another time."

Stayed with kids","We were very happy with our stay at The Laffin Place. It was clean, centrally located, and had more than enough room for our family of five.
Our kids loved the arcade game and foosball table during our down time at home. Living in Washington state where A/C isn’t in all the homes, we were thankful for the coolness on the very hot days during our visit.
The only issues we had were minor ones. The home is located on a well traveled road so there was a high level of noise very early in the mornings from trucks and/or cars blasting loud music. One bathroom in the home can make it tricky depending on the size of your group.
That said, we wouldn’t hesitate to consider this home again in the future. Thank you to the hosts!"

Stayed with kids","The house was larger than expected which was really nice. Very very clean! I would stay here again now knowing what to expect. I reached out several times via message on the ABNB app and received copy and pasted scripted messages. When the check in day arrived I had to call and leave a voicemail asking for the check in process. Then I received another copy and paste message at roughly 2:50pm of instructions for check in at was set at 4pm. Kind of an issue when we had a several hour drive ahead of us to get there.
One of the main reasons we chose to book here was the parking on the premises. Unfortunately when my disabled elderly parents who are on the guest list arrived, we Found out that the parking was street parking only per the instructions. This was not indicated on the listing we triple checked. When the parking issue was addressed they offered the parking behind the garage as an option. It was a long walk (for an elderly person) and later in the week it snowed making it more difficult to walk to the car. There also isn’t a hand rail on the back porch for the 2 small steps. Heads up in the shower the hot is cold and the cold is hot.
All in all not a bad stay. Just make sure it fits your needs before booking."

You must use the key pad on the back door which wasnt clear after driving all day and arriving as it was getting dark. The unit was perfectly as pictured. Very clean and quiet which made for a relaxing weekend. Easy to walk to restaurants. We would recommend if you are in the area. Seth was responsive to assist."

Seth responded quickly and we're so grateful we had a safe place to sleep! The place was as described - clean, convenient and comfortable. We got a good night's sleep and back on the road early the next morning. Many thanks for Seth's flexibility (11:30pm arrival!) and welcoming of 2 kids and a dog :)."

We stayed here during our visit to see our niece graduate. The place was so well finished with everything a person could need for one night or several days stay. We were even able to prepare and store a few dishes to take to my niece's graduation party, because the kitchen was fully equipped. There was also a wonderful coffee bar stocked with k-cups and creamers. The bathroom had plenty of large fluffy towels. And, we had a washer/dryer available to use if needed. Everything was comfy cozy and it was easy to feel right at home. I highly recommend staying here."

The beds and linens were very comfortable, which made sleep easy. The kitchen was well stocked as well, though we didn’t have time to use it much. The location is great, as it is close to stores and restaurants. It is an older home, as mentioned, but other than some creaky floors, you could hardly tell since it seems recently updated. Next time we visit, we’ll definitely check to see if the home is available before booking anywhere else."

Stayed a few nights","Chip’s place was perfect. We never saw it in the daylight until the morning we left because we were so consumed with a tournament. Every time we came and went it was as easy as if we lived there. ￼ Safe and peaceful and plenty of space to sprawl out and decompress. ￼ Having an 11 o’clock check out was absolutely perfect. It gave us time to slowly roll that last day and actually leave feeling rested in unhurried. ￼ Chip was very responsive. Checkout was absolutely perfect. We didn’t have to do a thing! Like when you go to hotels and you don’t have to take care of the towels and the sheets or anything… That’s this place! Worth every penny and a huge blessing to a momma who needed a break! I wish more B&B places did this. In addition to the nightly rate and cleaning fee, you typically still have to take care of the dishes, strip the beds, start the washing machine and take out the trash AND get your family and belongings out. Cannot convey how nice it was to not have to do all the extra."

Although we didn’t use it-we loved the coffee flavor options for the Keurig! Nice little touches throughout…q-tips, extra hair ties, a fan, breakfast bars and a list of local restaurants. We ate at Old Canal Smoke House and it was fantastic! We’d love to stay at Chip’s again so we can explore all the shops and history that Chillicothe has to offer!"

The decor is modern and charming and the indoor/outdoor space is very well maintained. We had everything we needed and then some. There was one minor glitch with the keypad on check -in, but the host immediately answered the phone and got us right in - no wait! We look forward to staying at this property again the next time we are visiting the area. I will recommend the property and host to other out of state family members as well."

I was in that place was clean but personally I got no response back from them about why we left early so I was very upset about that. so if you prefer to sleep on her mattresses which most people do it wouldn’t be bad for you guys to stay there for me and my husband it was not good I ended up with a back ache and only slept three hours last night.

Katelyn has taken care of everything for you. The apartment is sparkly clean and so comfortable. Anything in the kitchen you could possibly need for making snacks to a full meal.

It was within walkable distance to local restaurants and shops and was clean and exactly what we were looking for. We were even surprised with a beautifully decorated Christmas tree awaiting us. Highly recommend!

Stayed a few nights","This place has more space than meets the eye. The sofa bed was actually really comfortable! And the kitchen was well equipped, organized and very clean. I was afraid we would be disturbed being right next to the fire department and restaurant next door but things were actually very quiet. And one of the bedrooms had a little sound machine just in case. Easily 5 stars! Great communication from the host."

Our stay was cut short for family emergency but we would highly recommend staying at Katlyn's place. It has everything you could possibly need. We will definitely look into booking with her again on our next trip to the area!

Stayed a few nights","Very lovely, clean and spacious! Amenities were nice; and the check-in/out instructions are straightforward. But here’s the “old gal” perspective: The heavy tension on the entry door made it tricky to hit that first (of 18) steps upstairs, less than a foot inside the doorway. Also, the TV was HUGE!…. :-) but we never watched anything because us old people don’t know how to navigate “YouTube TV!” LOL! Seriously, it was very nice, but might not be the best for some seniors."

Thanks. We had a great, albeit brief, stay. Just what we needed."

Stayed a few nights","The place was beautiful! Located right downtown, nestled between the Dock at the Water bar and a fire department and across from the beautiful Yoctangee park. The apartment is full of natural light, and the sparse decor is tasteful and well placed. There's a full kitchen with the basics, as well as a full-sized washer and dryer. There are 4 dedicated spaces in the rear of the building for parking, marked with tow-away signs to make sure you're not competing with patrons of the bar next door.
The host's communication was quick and pleasant, and we didn't have any issues during our trip. We will certainly book again in the near future for our next trip!"
