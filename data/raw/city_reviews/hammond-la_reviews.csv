Stayed with a pet","We wanted to stay in Hammond, so we could visit our friends who live there, just a few miles away.
We really enjoyed our four night stay at this adorable country charmer, and it was a huge plus to be walking distance to town, where we went to bars and restaurants and visited a few shops with our friends. We also enjoyed sitting on the beautiful porch, Relaxing with our golden retriever and taking her for long walks in the beautiful neighborhood. It was also nice to have a fenced in backyard to let our dog do her business first thing in the morning and before bed at night.
The home had everything we needed to feel very comfortable, and it’s located in a very safe area!
Tasha was very good at communicating with us from the time we booked until our departure. We would definitely stay there again… Maybe even next spring! 😊"

Stayed a few nights","The house is very much worth the rent. If you are having a small family get together it is much better than 3 hotel rooms. It has plenty of beds and bathrooms and the Dining and Living areas are great for sitting around talking. The front porch is also great for sitting and talking. There's plenty of Parking.
We were very impressed with the wood floors and the furniture. The quality was way beyond our expectations. There has been a lot of thought and effort to keeping everything neat, clean, high quality and in excellent condition. We pray that all future guests take care to treat the home with respect so others can enjoy it as much as we did.
Tasha was very helpful and accommodating during our stay. We had a glitch in communication caused by the AirBnB App. When Tasha would put a message for us on the App, it would send a text message copy to our cell phone. So we would text back. We didn't know that our texts were not going anywhere. Communication improved after we figured that out."

Stayed with kids","Tasha’s home was lovely. Clearly old, but not outdated. It was very charming. Plus there is so much within walking distance. It was terribly hot outside but felt great inside. Saw nearby homes mention the train nearby, we could hear them but not loudly and it never woke our toddlers. Speaking of, we used the high chair and pack and play and they were in great condition, the extra padded mattress for the pack and play was so helpful."

Group trip","An absolutely lovely, charming older home that's been beautifully expanded and updated. According to the owner's write-up the home is roughly 100 years old. If so they've left just enough of the old to give it character, but with all the modern comforts and conveniences.
The kitchen boasts rich distressed deep brown wood floors, beneath equally aged cabinets but with all updated hardware and topped off with well matched marble countertops and backsplash. The 5-burner Kenmore is a chef's dream stove. Leaving the kitchen, pantry, and power room area you step into the dining and living rooms with more rich cherry hardwood.
The kitchen was well appointed with everything we needed to prepare meals for our family of five.
Check-in and out was as easy as it gets. Communication with the hosts was flawless. The neighborhood is quiet. We noticed several people out for evening walks. Had our schedule permitted, we might have done the same.
The home appeared to have sufficient closets, however two of the three closets were locked and not available to guests. The third was also being used for storage leaving very little closest space. Given that we were in town for a wedding with multiple long dresses and suits to hang up the limited closet space presented a minor challenge. There were some oddities such as a bedroom that locked from the outside which provided our kids an opportunity for pranking mom & dad by locking us in our room. 🙄
Overall we greatly enjoyed our stay and would definitely love to stay again should we find ourselves back in Hammond."

Super cute, comfortable & perfect location for walking to the baseball game or dinner downtown. Pet friendly & stocked with essentials, and perfectly equipped to cook & relax - especially on the shaded & breezy front porch swing! Highly recommend."

We travel a lot and stay in a ton of different places. We had a last minute trip pop up to Hammond and thought it would be nice to stay in an AirBNB instead of a hotel. We needed somewhere to stay for a full month. Tasha responded very quickly with an approval to rent her beautiful home.
When we arrived there were fresh flowers on the table. We explored the house with excitement. This 100 year old home was meticulously kept. We were so surprised at how nice everything was. The front porch swing and rocking chairs were our favorite place to hang out every morning with a cup of coffee and every night with a glass of wine.
Tasha was great. We communicated several times via text. She is very knowledgeable about the surrounding area.
I can’t recommend this place enough. We truly had a wonderful time."

Petra & Bran really put a lot of time, thought and effort into making their guest feel like they were valued. Every detail in the house was well thought out to provide comfort, luxury and security. The communication was given promptly and respectfully. It was a pleasure to meet them in person during our stay and learn the history of how Harper’s Haven came to be.
The location is perfect! It is near the interstate and town but remote enough that you feel nestled in the woods. The outside area provided plenty of room for an outdoor gathering day or night. The inside was beautifully decorated, with a well stocked coffee/ tea bar and snacks for those who are too weary from travel to prepare a meal. The beds rooms a very comfortable with plenty of space and bathrooms are well stocked with necessities for things that might get overlooked when packing. This was one of my favorite stays. We will definitely be back"

I absolutely enjoyed my time with my group of friends and it really felt at home. From the sweet little message on the board telling me happy birthday to them also providing snacks and bottles of waters for everyone. I really enjoyed my stay with them. They are all around nice people. The house and the surrounding area is quiet and peaceful you couldn’t even tell it was a neighborhood how quiet it was and that’s one of the best part. I was super upset we didn’t get to experience the outside area because we were traveling so much but we will definitely be booking with them again. I would say definitely book with them you will not be disappointed!!

The pantry also was well stocked with cereal, a whole gamut of spices -n-such.
One of the things that truly stands out is how CLEAN IT WAS! I'm a cleanie & I was impressed ‼️❤️
They even left us an anniversary card.💯
Debi and Rex are quick to respond to messages. It's obvious that they take pride in being clean, kind, courteous and responsive.

Stayed over a week","Nice little place to stay, and a fabulous host. Well stocked kitchen, basket full of snacks, another basket in the bathroom filled with anything you may have missed packing. I'm on the road a lot for work, and this was about as close as it gets to feeling at home when I'm not. The only downside is proximity to the train tracks, and that train whistle is loud when you're sleeping, otherwise it's a nice quiet neighborhood."

Stayed a few nights","When visiting Hammond Louisiana, I highly recommend booking your stay with Debra and Rex!!!!! I was lucky to find this beautiful gem while searching for a place to rent for my cousin, who was visiting us from NJ for a few days. Debra responded to my messages immediately and answered all questions within minutes. I knew right away that this was the best place for us!!
The apartment is centrally located between downtown Hammond and SLU, with sidewalks leading to both destinations.
Debra and Rex’s place is perfect!! It was exceptionally clean, comfortable, well decorated and included many extra supplies in the kitchen and bath area, something you rarely find in other vacation rental spaces. The apartment has a cozy outside covered patio that is safe and comfortable!
My cousin said that Debra was the perfect hostess, and was always available to answer questions.
There’s no doubt we will be booking Debra and Rex’s place again in the near future. Thank you Debra for making my cousins stay a memorable one!!"

Stayed over a week","5-stars! I stayed in here in Hammond for 3 months while on a clinical rotation and it was perfect. The hosts were attentive, always available if the need arose, and were accommodating when my stay had to be extended. Upon arrival, the place was perfectly clean and there were snacks on the table, drinks in the fridge, and some frozen breakfast sandwiches in the freezer. The bathroom was equipped with small sample size bottles of shampoo, conditioner, lotion, toothpaste, travel razors, a small sewing kit, tissues, and all the small things you would find at a hotel. Location is perfect, nearby Southeastern as well as downtown Hammond with plenty of restaurants. This place is perfect for the weekend getaway as well as longer stays as you have everything you need to live comfortably. If I’m ever back in Hammond, I will definitely return. Highly recommend."

The house is lovely and perfectly situated in downtown Hammond, near restaurants and other things to see and do. The house was spotlessly clean and well-appointed. We enjoyed the house a great deal and it made our visit all the better by its perfect location. Amanda was excellent throughout the process. Would certainly recommend and book again."

Stayed with kids","￼Overall, this is a lovely home and great place to stay. The rooms are quite large, and the space is aesthetically pleasing. We did have an issue with Wi-Fi and the door keypad, but Amanda handled it quickly. The only thing I can suggest is to change the door keypad because it was not working correctly. This may be because it rained pretty heavily the first night we were there. With that said, I would not park under the large oak trees on the side street next to Lee’s if it rains. I had a lot of tree debris on my car that was sticky. On the second day, some yard maintenance workers were there about 30 minutes. It was really loud at times which￼ caused a problem with my autistic son. Maybe let customers know ahead of time if you have scheduled yard maintenance."

Even with that, I would gladly stay there again."

A few things worth mentioning: there is only one tv, so if you are traveling with teens or young kids, sharing may get tricky. Also, the house is directly on a two lane busy street. There is traffic noise all hours of the day and night so if you are a light sleeper this place may be unpleasant. The house is also very close to plenty shopping and restaurants."

Everything was absolutely perfect and Anna was an amazing host! She made sure to answer any questions I had, gave recommendations and made sure to keep me updated on weather changes.
Bedrooms:Beds are very comfortable, pillows are firm and not flat (which is amazing)
Bathroom: very clean, water gets very hot, towels are extremely soft and big.
Kitchen: very clean and spacious for cooking (even though we did not cook) she made sure we had snacks for when we got there, as we didn’t get in until midnight. Coffee bar was very well stocked with great choices.
Utility room: was the perfect place for our girls to get ready of the mornings with the big mirror and spacious area.
We will definitely be back next year for the Pull, hopefully we can stay longer."

If ever I am in the area again this is the first place I will seek out! Exemplary customer service! I regret that our accommodation fell through due to a bout of very severe unexpected weather.

I was in town for business, so I did not get to see much of Hammond, unfortunately. The cottage is very well appointed and extremely comfortable. I rested wonderfully after my long days. Tim made sure that I had everything I needed during my stay, yet afforded me privacy. In fact, we did not even get the chance to meet in person. I would gladly stay at the cottage again when I return to the area! Thank you, Tim!!!"

Stayed a few nights","Great spot to stay. Great taste in design, comfort and decor. It's a fresh little renovation that they did beautifully. The rental is ideal if you are looking for a really lovely, well kept little hideaway. It's close to the main strip of downtown Hammond which is great. The guesthouse offered privacy and the layout of the property gives you space to use the hot tub and cone and go without fear of being a bother to your house. It's charming and comfortable.
A few things of note:
All the linens are clean, soft and inviting.
Great smells of ginger and cleanliness
Tim is super responsive yet unobtrusive
Small space but laid out beautifully, nothing feels cramped, closets and cabinets for your things and plenty of space to prepare a meal.
Darn powerful HVAC system."

A short drive to SLU baseball games and any other campus activities. Tastefully decorated with high ceilings and beautiful exposed brick walls, extremely clean, comfy beds, and well stocked with every thoughtful amenity possible. Jeannie and Mitch definitely raised the host bar up several notches, as they were very responsive, friendly, helpful, and went above and beyond to make our stay as customized to our needs as possible!

This apartment was absolutely gorgeous. We want to live there. Big, comfy beds/ clean, fluffy towels and linens, soft blankets and pillows everywhere, exposed brick, tall ceilings, skylights, great water pressure, very clean, and they made it super easy to find with a slideshow of how to find the right door to enter. They put a pack n play and a high chair in our unit since we have a 2 year old, which was super helpful. We walked to street side market and yellow bird cafe for meals. Farmers market was set up right outside of our place one morning. It was such a wonderful little weekend in downtown. We can’t wait to go back!!"

We loved the walkable location and the easy free parking in the lot right across the street. There is also street parking. The hosts were always very responsive. The one thing to note is that the trains are loud. Didn't bother us but if people are sensitive to sound, it could be an issue...though there is a back bedroom that doesn't get the noise.
We will definitely be back when to Mitch & Jeannie's place when our travels take us back to Hammond."

Stayed a few nights","This spot was super fun and almost perfect for our trip! Overall, I’d rate it a 4.5.
Pros:
- Super unique spot in a historical building with exposed brick and adorable decor, just as pictured
- Super clean
- Wonderful layout with plenty of room
- Clear instructions to access and check out (be sure to check out the presentation they send before you arrive and instructions on the fridge for check out)
- Comfortable beds and couch
- Great communication and friendly hosts
Cons:
- This is a second story unit so you are required to carry luggage up the stairs.
- Because the location is downtown, there are a few bars around so if you’re there on a weekend like we were, you may hear much yelling and such into the morning hours
- The train is LOUD and super fast and comes by kind of late so be aware if loud noises bother you
- No hooks for used towels in bathroom and no folding luggage rack
Overall wonderful experience and we would probably stay here again when visiting!"

Stayed with kids","We simply loved everything about this house! It’s even nicer than it looks in the photos, and it was clean and spacious and in a super location that made it convenient for everything. As a host, Renee was quite responsive and very sweet.
We have family in Hammond and hope to make this our permanent destination whenever we come to town. I can’t imagine a better place to stay. It’s pristine, has lots of room, has a large washer and dryer, crushed ice from the fridge, three full bathrooms, large carport, easy combination door lock, three really nice bedrooms with comfortable beds, and so much more. Can’t say enough nice things about it. Highly recommended!"

Stayed one night","Location, location, location! This Airbnb is in a prime location. It took me less than 5 minutes to walk to Southeastern’s campus for my conference. Saved me a headache of trying to find guest parking on campus. Then for dinner, it was a 5 minute drive to downtown hammond which had plenty of food options. Thanks Renee for the local suggestions!
The hosts are very responsive and made sure I had everything I needed for a nice stay. This Airbnb had to be one of the nicest I have ever stayed in. Everything was brand new! Not to mention so many beautiful touches throughout the house. I slept great as I drifted into sleep on a comfortable bed. I also liked the covered parking area so I didn’t have to worry about the rain when I arrived.
I had absolutely no issues with my stay. I would highly recommend this house especially anyone with families or anyone having to visit Southeastern’s campus. Open, spacious, and clean. Thanks again!"

Stayed a few nights","We stayed here while visiting Hammond during Thanksgiving. It had the perfect amount of space for our family of four (2 teenagers). The house was beautifully renovated and had all the amenities that we needed. It even had games and puzzles to keep our family entertained. The beds were extremely comfortable, and we all slept great. It also has a great location close to the college, downtown Hammond and many restaurants. I highly recommend it, and we plan to stay there again the next time we are in Hammond visiting family."

Stayed with kids","We loved our stay at this apartment in downtown Hammond! It was close walking distance to all of our favorite restaurants and the Saturday morning Farmer's Market. There were live bands and the train at night but once in the house (with a sound machine turned up) none of the downtown noises bothered us light sleepers.
Php did a great job in promptly responding and communicating when we reached out. The check in/out process was very easy.
The mattresses were pretty hard and we had a little bit difficult time getting to sleep but hanging out downtown and listening to music until we were worn out made it a little easier to crash at night! I would definitely recommend this apartment if Hammond is your destination!"

A few icks about the place: dust build-up on the nightstands, on the window sills, under the bed, the jets in the tub had hard water build-up and every night there were tons of snails outside the door. One last thing, the departure list was more than what we’re used to-wash the towels, take the trash to the dumpster."

The only complaint was the bed was super hard but some people like that and the train was loud which we knew going it. We brought our sound machine which helped and it was worth it to be so close to everything. I wouldn’t stay long stays due to the bed and my back but other than that it was great!

As other reviews noted it’s one block from the train station so you’ll hear very occasional trains. Great amenities inside including large TVs, very comfortable mattress, and lots of coffee. Had a quick question about parking and the owner got back to me ASAP. Wifi was the fastest I’ve seen at a rental. My favorite place that I’ve stayed in Hammond so far!"

Stayed a few nights","Location, location, location...and did we mention spacious. Great location in downtown Hammond walkable to all of downtown. Great restaurants, coffee shops, bars and shopping. In addition, there were 2 fantastic breweries within a short 2 mile drive. Communication from Php was fantastic. We did have an issue getting in at first. Communication was so good that they almost overdid it. Thetell you to download their app which isn't necessary to gain entrance. Took us reading the directions, again, that were emailed in advance of our stay. The apartment was very spacious and not overfurnished leaving plenty of room to make ourselves at home.
We were travelling with 2 small dogs, so the city park diaginally across from the cottage was a plus. We would not hesitate to stay here again. Don't be fooled by a musty smell at check-in as noted in other reviews. It disapates quickly once the AC starts up. Running the ceiling fans, at all time would probably eliminate the issue, altgether."

This property is as close to perfect as is possible in its location. It's practically in view of the Amtrak station, and literally the middle of the downtown scene. The Southeastern Louisiana campus is only a five minute walk away. The property is a well-equipped, clean, cute and functional respite from a long day of enjoying everything Hammond has on offer. The kitchen is well set up. The bath even has a whirlpool tub! At the end of the stay, check out is super simple with few steps. No hotels put you car free in the middle of downtown the way this place does!"

Instantly, feels like home when you enter. The house has everything that you and your family may need, from cooking, laundry, cleaning, disinfectant and bandaids! Everything! Home is located near several great restaurants, and shopping. I highly recommend this home, if you’re visiting Hammond. My husband and I expressed this is now, “our home way from home”, whenever we visit Louisiana. Carla went out of way to ensure we felt welcomed. Left nice notes around the home and snacks, that our children thoroughly enjoyed. Carla, thank you again for hosting this beautiful, warm home and showing that great southern hospitality, to us.😊"

I was apprehensive traveling alone to an unfamiliar area , however, I always felt safe on my morning walks, and returning home after dark. Beth was a perfect host , answering all my questions about the area, and making some great recommendations to try. The space, well, words can not do it justice. When I walked in the door, I felt like I was home. All the little touches, from local LA snacks to fresh coffee beans, beautifully decorated, white glove clean, and even a personal welcome note. Beth thought of everything.
I will definitely return on my next visit to the area."

Stayed a few nights","Beth's guest house was wonderful! The place is extremely clean and neat with everything needed for a fantastic stay.
The guest house is private and quiet. There's great heat for the chilly nights, and the parking was right outside the door. The kitchen had a Keurig, a stove, and a full-size fridge. There's a work area with a printer and a nice little table by the kitchen. The tv has lots of choices-
The main part of Hammond is right down the road, maybe 1/2 a mile, where there's a very nice modern type coffee shop located in an old drugstore building from 1896.
I'm challenged when it comes to lock boxes, I can't ever figure them out, but Beth responded right away, and I was able to get the key. I came and went as I needed.
I loved Beth's guest house and would definitely stay there again when I'm in town! It was a little oasis from the conference I was attending and also while I was dealing with a difficult family matter at the time!"

While I didn't visit for tourism purposes (just a wedding), I was pleasantly surprised.
Finally, checkout was relaxed and with no issues at all. Thanks, Beth!"

When we thought we were locked out (we weren’t - just delirious without enough coffee yet!) she called us right away and was ready to drive over to help! We found the loft equipped with everything including extras we might need, good snacks and coffee. The studio has a nice vibe, is spacious, clean, comfy, and full of original art and local Louisiana decor. Highly recommend!"

Also, the apartment has a washing machine and clothes dryer. Everything is within walking distance and right in front of the door is a parking lot ( about 12 vehicles ) for the rental car. Hammond University is also within walking distance. Trips to New Orleans or Baton Rouge are highly recommended because of the proximity to Hammond. Communication with Jessica was always very friendly and accommodating. We can only recommend this loft and will be guaranteed to book it again next year to visit our son who is studying at the SLU."

Stayed a few nights","This place is in a great location in downtown Hammond. I am originally from Hammond, but I live in Chicago. My husband and I came into town for my class reunion, so we decided to try something different rather than staying with family. We had the best time! This place made us feel like we were on a weekend getaway - a vacation in our hometown.
This place is within walking distance to every restaurant in the downtown area. We were able to try out some new restaurants, plus visit some old ones, and we just enjoyed the experience of what downtown Hammond has to offer.
The place itself is very charming and comfortable with plenty of space for two people. It was quite at night, so you can definitely get a good night’s sleep, and you can hear the hustle bustle of the surrounding businesses during the day, but that didn’t bother us at all because we weren’t there half the time during the day anyway.
The communication with Jessica was great. Whenever I sent her a message, she responded pretty quickly and was very nice.
Overall, I would definitely recommend this place. I’m for sure going to recommend this to some of my friends who live out of state but come back to Hammond for frequent visits. Thank you, Jessica!"

Stayed about a week","My job had me come out to the area to assess the damage from Hurricane Ida. There were little to no hotels available for me to stay that were within a reasonable driving distance. My wife came across this location, and based on the reviews I committed to it quickly.
The loft is right in the middle of Hammand, LA, a college town I had not heard of before this trip. The town is lively, with several great food options as well as quite a few bars. The town overall a fun time.
The loft was clean, stocked with snacks and water, and was a breathe of fresh air from the usual stale hotel chains I tend to stay at for work. It has all the ammenities you need. The hospitality provided by Jessica is hard to beat. I would 100% recommend staying here."

Hammond lies about an hour drive north of New Orleans--a bit longer if you drive the causeway across Lake Pontchartrain (which everyone should do at least once, but you may want to do again).
 
Hammond's historic neighborhood, around East Thomas Street, is small but is and full of great shopping and restaurant choices. We stayed in an apartment above a  salon. One bedroom and bath, a good size living room/kitchen area, cable television and internet.
 
Street parking only, but we had no problem finding a spot right outside our front door. That ""front door"" is in the alley behind the salon. Not the greatest first impression, but the apartment itself is quite fine with vintage brick and very well appointed It is also totally quiet and private. We will definitely stay here again.

Loved that fresh coffee plus filters are provided and even snacks and all toiletries! The air conditioning was perfect, too! Jessica is a great hostess and responds immediately.

Stayed about a week",Jessica's place is Amazing! So great I really didn't want to tell everyone because I want it to myself lol. Being a business owner I know how much reviews help so that's why I'm not going to be selfish and leave one for her :-) Jessica responds very quickly and was an absolute pleasure to work with. We also met her husband outside of the apartment a couple times and he was just as kind and friendly! This place is a little hidden gem right smack in the middle of the best places fro drinks and food. We loved being able to just walk out the door and have cocktails or eat! So many great places all around to choose from. I will tell you that we always needed up downstairs at a place called Tacos and Beer for drinks and late night snacks! Also Cate Street Seafood Station is a must for seafood or my favorite the Cate Street Sushi Roll!!!! Right across the street at Red White and Brew you can have your favorite beverage to include hundreds and wine! I went over on Saturday and caught some great live entertainment as well!!! The apartment was very nice and the bed and bedding was great! She also provided us with an assortment of little snacks that was very appreciated! The apartment had everything so no need to bring anything to this place. If you get a chance and this place is available I Highly Recommend it!!! Overall this place is a solid 5 STARS!!!! Thank you Jessica for sharing your little slice of paradise with us! We can't wait to stay again! THANK YOU!

45 min from New Orleans by car, her apartment is large, bright, super comfortable and tastefully decorated.
It is more than perfect for people who want to be near NOLA without having the noise from the city.
On the price side, it's a rare find during Mardi Gras.
We were delighted to stay here, Luke is super responsive and adorable. Some snacks in the area are available (it's always nice when you arrive a little late)
In short, you couldn't dream better than starting our vacation!
A real joy to be in Ponchatoula at Luke's:)"

I do not know if there was a great deal of time before we were the guests, but the cream that was left for coffee, was rock solid. Minor issue, but somewhat important. and a inconvience. Overall very quiet, nice area, and kind of vintage setting of Louisiana's southern charm."

Stayed a few nights",A very nice and quiet place to stay that is nicely adorned. Luke's place is in a quiet neighborhood with a little park across the street. Great location to downtown and you can walk to several nice restaurants. Would definitely recommend staying here and would stay again.

Stayed a few nights","We stayed for the weekend with our grown granddaughter and our great grandson and we had a great time. The cottage is cute and picturesque with some great windows. Luke was a very nice man and very interesting to chat with. He was also very responsive to our needs. More than 2 people can stay here but I think its perfect for a couple. Television in two areas and the master bedroom mattress was remarkably comfortable. As you can see in the pictures the access is upstairs so keep that in mind if you have bad knees but we felt like it was definitely worth the visit and hope to stay there again. Everyone in our party was happy.
If you stay tell Luke Mike and Donna say hey!"

Stayed about a week","Luke was a great host with a comfortable, roomy, and stylish place to stay. The bed was super comfortable and so was the couch! The kitchen was fully functional, and we used the stove, oven, toaster oven, fridge/freezer, and coffee maker while we were there. The place was decorated well, comfortable and enjoyable to come back to at the end of a great day in the Louisiana outdoors! Luke spent some time checking in with us when we were there and offered suggestions for us on things to do and see and where to eat in the area."

He even went so far as to leave a card and bottle of wine for my husband and I the night after our wedding. The apartment was just as pictured. Thanks Luke

Stayed a few nights","This place was perfectly clean, had great AC, and was in the ideal location for our trip. You only have to walk a couple minutes to get to restaurants, plus the park right across the street made a perfect spot to visit with my nephews and niece. The only thing we didn't love about our stay was the very low water pressure in the shower, which made taking a shower a very long ordeal. Luke said this was due to an unexpected problem with the city, and since everything else about this place was great, I would still recommend this airbnb to anyone."

Stayed with kids",This above the garage apartment has been updated with vinyl plank wood floors throughout and nicely painted walls and ceilings giving it a nice open and modern feel. It is up a flight of 17 steps and overlooks the owners backyard. It is in a very safe environment and is situated directly across the street from a city park that has a nice playground for children and a great walking path. The unit has charm and is equiped with an apartment sized refrigerator/freezer as well as a range so you can have the convenience of a kitchen during your stay. The bathroom is small but adequate not much counter space but there is a mirrored medicine cabinet above the sink which helps to store your things. I enjoyed an extended stay here recently and would say that the only negative is the lack of water pressure in the shower. The wi-fi worked really well and there is plenty of storage in the apartment. The bed was very comfortable. I would suggest you bring a sleep mask if you like to sleep late as there is a lot of natural light that streams into the bedroom. I would not recommend using the fold out bed on the couch as it is extremely uncomfortable - there is plenty of room in the living room to bring a blowup mattress if you need to sleep more than two guests.

Stayed one night","Very cute apartment. It had a nice feel about it. Snack were left for us on the table. That was a nice
touch. The space itself was clean, if only a bit dusty. My only real complaint was that the walkway, the stairs leading up to the apartment and the porch area were extremely dirty. Definitely needs to be power washed. Also, cigarettes butts in an ashtray on the deck from previous guests. First impressions are everything, and this was a poor first impression.
On a positive note...most comfy Airbnb bed I’ve ever slept in. Kudos for comfort!!"

Stayed one night","Super communication from the owners, and they checked in with us to make sure all was good when we got there. The rooms where tidy and trendy (beautiful white and gold accents) and small ""treats"" which were a nice touch. Bed was super comfy, and my biggest compliment is the bathroom (I'm picky) as it was very clean and quaint. They might want to put a ""watch your head"" or paint a bright color on the overhang above the stairs, tall guys helping their wives with lots of pillows and bags might miss it 😉. VERY QUIET area and lots of peace from traffic and people... You won't be disappointed!"

Stayed a few nights","Let me tell y’all about this place. Right off the bat, I give this place a 12/10. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.
First, the place itself is super adorable. We thought it was above the house, but it’s not. It’s above the garage in a separate building, so we didn’t see or hear the hosts at all except for our initial check in, which we prefer in our Airbnb’s. Everything was super clean, lots of stuff available if you forgot anything at home bath wise and some snacks and such. The neighborhood was cute. Small corner cafe right around the block.
Second, although we didn’t communicate with Luke a *ton,* he responded quickly, was accommodating of our late arrival due to road trip delays, and sent us to eat amazing fried chicken when we finally made it there exhausted. He was very friendly and made himself available to us if we needed him at all, which was nice.
Third, we went into the city for lunch, then went back to the house with the intent to take a quick hour nap and then head back into the city for dinner and drinks....but instead we slept 15 hours straight, and we were completely happy with it. The bed is so comfortable, I could have stayed in it the whole time we were down there. I slept like a starfish and still wasn’t touching my boyfriend. The comforter is fluffy but not too hot. Best bed I ever slept in. The AC unit is a little loud, but I found the hum of it comforting, and it was very efficient in keeping the place as cool or as warm as you want it.
I was very surprised at how nice the little place was, we even joked about moving in. Well worth every dollar we paid to stay there, and I would definitely recommend checking it out. Its one of the nicest, most comfortable Airbnb’s we have stayed in. It was the best part of our trip and we greatly enjoyed it!! :)"
