Stayed with kids","The house was perfect for us! We have two children (12 and 4) the closed in and very private backyard, with putting green was AMAZING!
Bedrooms left nothing to be desired. Huge comfy beds, oversized comforters with clean soft sheets. We all slept great.
The kitchen was breathtaking. I made breakfast and lunch for our small family of 4. But was able to make large dinners for family that came over later in our stay.
Our host was amazing and stayed in touch our entire stay. We will for sure check here first when coming back to visit Bville ❤️"

Stayed with a pet","Our family found The Osage Inn as a last minute getaway from Arlington, TX and it was absolutely wonderful! We were able to drive and bring our dogs and the house was just incredible! Our kids felt like they were staying in a movie star's house. The kitchen is luxurious and if you love to cook, like my husband, while traveling, this is your dream. The charm and decor of the whole house were so fun and Brittany was a gracious host. She was communicative and super friendly and even helped us AFTER we checked out when we realized we had left something behind. From sipping cocktails in the ""red room"" while listening to actual records of Frank Sinatra to letting our kids and furbabies play safely in the private back yard, this home away from home was simply meant for us. We will absolutely be back and can't wait to stay again!"

Stayed a few nights",Very nice and clean rental with a responsive host. We only needed shower soap and coffee pods. The neighborhood was quiet and felt safe. I would say that the king bed is VERY soft so if your back needs more support you might want to try the queen bed. Overall it was a great weekend getaway!

Stayed a few nights",We had a wonderful experience. Very relaxing & comfortable environment. We loved the Victrola & listening to vinyl instead of watching tv like we do at home. We ordered us one on the way home! Got it today. Enjoyed cooking dinner in such a fancy kitchen. The neighborhood is so cute. We walked around & looked at the historic houses. Brittany went out of her way & brought us chairs & logs when we inquired about wanting to sit out & enjoy the fall weather. King bed was very comfortable. Would definitely recommend this special place.

Our favorite part was definitely the room with the record player. So fun! Only complaint was the master bedroom. There was nowhere to put your stuff. The only furniture was the bed and a small end table.

Stayed a few nights","We were very happy and comfortable in Chad's home, which was in a great location and not far from downtown. Chad was extremely responsive, especially when we accidently locked the key inside the house!
The only thing to keep in mind is that in the main bedroom the bed is extremely soft--the kind you sink into. This may be fine for some (not us), but we made our way into the 2nd room where there was a completely different mattress that was just perfect.
We HIGHLY recommend visiting Crossing 2nd to eat which is quaint and has OUTSTANDING food selections!!!
Would definitely stay here again!"

My favorite thing is the water feature in the beautiful landscaping in front, which you can hear when you sit in the dining room or library/den. The location is quiet. There are cozy places to sit; the kitchen is quite impressive and useable; the beds are comfortable. Pet-friendly to top it off!"

Stayed one night","This place is beautiful! Very bougie. If you appreciate beautiful decor I think you will enjoy it! Beds were comfortable, kitchen well stocked, plenty of towels, fireplace was nice on a cold night, and Chad even let this group of ladies park in the back to feel more secure. Lots of character! We were a little disappointed that the fancy coffee machine had an error and wouldn’t brew, but it looked very nice! If I could give any feedback it would be the kitchen cabinets. A few of the doors were broken and frustrating to open and close, but those things happen and didn’t distract from the character and charm. Just maybe needs a bit of TLC. Overall, it was a very upscale and comfortable place for us to celebrate our friend’s 50th birthday and a steal in my opinion!"

There were some quirky pieces (elephant foot stools), a gorgeous red porch we couldn't use because it was too cold when we were there, beautiful outdoor lighting at light, and a very walkable neighborhood to take our dog on walks.
Chad responded to questions immediately, and was extremely friendly. We will stay in Chad's bungalow again when we return to Bartlesville!"

Group trip","Very nice house. Had a good stay. Chad was responsive and helpful. Only minor issue is that we chose the house in large part due to the fireplace, but it was not operable on arrival. Chad turned it on for us partway through our stay, but he wasn’t comfortable with it being left on for very long. Like I said, it was a minor issue, but the fireplace should probably be removed from the listing if it’s not to be used. Otherwise a very nice stay with a flexible host!"

Stayed a few nights","This is the best place in Bartlesville we have rented. We hosted a Thanksgiving gathering and Chad helped us with all our needs for the house. Since we hosted Thanksgiving, we used many of the appliances and they were all needed. The Ice Maker in the kitchen was a great bonus. The pictures describe the house perfectly. I do recommend you unload off the main street but park in the back. Unloading in the back requires many trips up the stairs. The backyard was perfect for our dog and we were able to have a fire one night in the backyard. The location of the house is perfect but everything in Bartlesville is 15-20 minutes away no matter where you stay. Thanks again to Chad for allowing us to host our group for the dinner and answering all of our questions."

Stayed a few nights","We absolutely loved our stay at Chad’s 1920’s style home. He has an eclectic design taste combining gorgeous antiques with contemporary modern and mid-century style.
The upgraded, Modern kitchen had every gadget or cooking tool you could imagine, abundant cups, dishes, cookware, mixing bowls and practically anything else you could imagine, AND a LARGE stainless steel sink to clean everything. The cooktop/oven was gas with multiple burners and a large oven and hood. The glass door fridge was modern and kept our food (and beer) cold. He even provided a Keurig coffeemaker WITH coffee and a fancy coffee/latte making machine if you should desire to master it. The directions were right next to the machine!
The beds were comfy and I enjoyed having a ceiling fan in the bedroom. The front living room furniture was comfortable as well.
We never turned on the TV as were having too much fun catching it up with relatives!
Oh, and there were plenty of towels and wash clothes in the bathroom.
I highly recommend Chads 1920’s home! We’ll be back!"

Well equipped kitchen. Living room was comfortable and a nice place to visit with friends and family. Chad was a very attentive host, available to answer questions and meet our every need. I would recommend Chad as a host without reservation, and the house is lovely and met all our needs."

Stayed one night","Since staying in Airbnbs more frequently, I’ve had to adjust my criteria for ratings. It seems like a lot of places now charge big cleaning fees in order to make more money overall, but then they still expect you to clean up yourself, and half the time, the homes aren’t actually fully cleaned.
This house is decorated very well. But unfortunately, having cool furniture doesn’t really add any more value to a place, especially when basic things aren’t working or cleaned properly. Mold in the espresso machine - clearly not been cleaned regularly in a long time. Bad water pressure in the kitchen. Dust all over the blinds in the bedrooms, under beds.
I’m not sure how closely the host reads messages. Seemed to not understand some questions I had, and it just wasn’t worth trying to go back and forth.
It’s a cool old house. But should cost much less if so many things are not up to higher standards."

When you pull up in front you’re met with an enchanted cottage. But when you walk inside- wow! Over the top eclectic, funky cool and fun. Chad has style to spare and it shows in every thoughtful detail. The beds were super comfy, multiple options available for morning coffee, and even wine and drinks available to purchase. Chad was quick to respond to every communication. If I had one dream request it would be a personal barista to work the amazing espresso machine (thankfully, simpler options were available). If there were a six star option I would give it. You MUST stay here!"

Even though the house is so close to downtown it was very peaceful and quiet! Our hosts were extremely responsive and friendly, clear communicators. It was the perfect place to relax, rest, and be with family during our stay. We would definitely stay there again! Thank you!"

Group trip","This place was perfect for our needs. We had an unfortunate death in the family and rather than spending money on several hotel rooms we decided to get an Airbnb. We wanted to all stay together and this property gave us the opportunity to be together during this difficult time, but not feel confined by everyone being in one hotel room (usually where we end up before sleeping). The kids had a place to play and the adults could reminisce. I cannot thank you enough!!"

The house is well taken care of. They made sure you have everything you would need. But a store is located close by for anything else you would need. I loved how they provided lots of information about the house and where to go in town.
Our visit was relaxing and a refreshing break from our busy life! The backyard is like a fairytale garden. Very nice to take a stroll around. At night we were able to have a fire in the fire pit and roast some marshmallows. It was peaceful to look up at the stars, it's surprisingly quiet for how close you are to downtown.
It's also nice to go walking downtown and checking out the old building and shops that are around town.
And I'll add that there are lots of parks around town for kids to play.
100% would recommend staying here! We will definitely be returning!
Thank you for hosting us."

First, our group included my elderly mother and one guest with a braced ankle injury. We knew there were stairs, but were there ever!! Walking in there are 18 steps to the living room and kitchen and 18 more to the bedrooms. And, there was only 2 wash cloths in 2 1/2 bathrooms and 5 mismatched bath towels for 4 guests staying 2 nights. We felt that was a little skimpy when paying over $200 a night. A coffee pot and coffee were provided but no creamer or sugar. Not required, of course. Just a little thing. But, it was a beautiful, clean place which we greatly appreciated!!"

Very basic cable package so not much to watch on TV and no option for Netflix/Hulu.
Overall a great place."

Stayed a few nights","The place was perfect, check-in and the host were not. Very clean and pictures are accurate. We had a check-in nightmare. This was my first Airbnb experience and will be my last. After a friendly message from the host the place was ready, we stop in at 11:00 (after a 6 hour drive), enter the lockbox code but it doesn't work, try several variations thinking maybe a typo but none work. I messaged the host letting her know it didn't work and didn't get a reply all day. We go back at 6:00 only to find we still cannot unlock with the code. I've had no phone call, message or reply all day from the host so we can only think the worst that I've been scammed on this...great. I continue calling the host, messaging, still no reply. So I contact Airbnb to handle it. They were great and immediately contact the host, she arrives, very disgruntled about my calls, no apology for the hour and half I've wasted waiting either. Apparently the lock box was broke, and she had a hectic day. However a simple reply to my message from the host, an answer to a phone call, much less an apology would have resolved the whole scenario since I'm a relaxed person just wanting a getaway to Pioneer Woman's lodge. Not handled professionally at all. I was really shocked someone wanting to rent their place would treat their customer that way."

Stayed a few nights","An excellent and comfortable find here, well-matched to the description and absolutely worth a stay if you're seeking quiet nights, walking trails, and a cozy home full of antiques and country decor. The setting is rural and found along easily navigable gravel roads. My phone map led me right to the spot, and Sharon/Don provided helpful directions. They were kind and welcoming, offering local tips, and then letting me have peace and privacy for my stay. Their home is right next to the cabin, but the front porch faces away from their windows. Plenty of wildlife, stars, and space.
The space matches the photos; it just bares noting that this is a rustic spot. Dishes are not pristinely clean, floors and furniture show signs of former guests, and you can occasionally hear critters scratching around under the house. But that (mostly) adds to the charm. The beds and furniture are comfortable, the space is larger than I expected, and there is excellent birding from the front porch or balcony."

It’s a quiet, peaceful retreat. My husband and I were able to take walks around the property and get some much needed fresh air. The location is great for a quiet, relaxing night and removed enough from light pollution to be able to see the stars, but still close enough to town that you can access food and activities in just under 10 mins. Sharon and Don are friendly and easy to communicate with. They made us feel welcome and made sure we had everything needed."

Stayed a few nights","A great get away. Peaceful. Clean. Spacious. Comfortable. Safe.
Hosts always responsive/communicative and welcoming. Sharon greeted us and let us meet the critters of her farm.
The cabin was quite warm when we arrived- and it took a bit to cool off - but we got the AC units and fans going and it was quite comfortable through both extremes of hot and cold during our stay.
it’s worth noting before you go: WiFi/internet access was spotty at best - and I had depended on getting to work remotely in evenings. I think it was more the location + around weather instability than hosts’ fault. It was difficult to plan out day trips and i wish I had prepped a little more in advance.
In general, we had no cell signal around most of northern Oklahoma and south central Kansas for the entire trip. Getting directions was an exercise. Of course, the final day there, it worked well.
Overall- we would go back for a getaway if wanting to stay in the area."

Their cabin is a small rustic home which has a well-appointed kitchen and is very clean inside. I especially enjoyed morning coffee on the deck opening out from the upstairs sleeping loft. Stairs up to the loft are steep, but they are wide and the bannisters are solid — no problem for this elder traveler. This is a great place for folks who like antiques, local history, birdwatching and wildlife. Although the location feels remote, it’s convenient to Bartlesville downtown, Pawhuska and Woolaroc."

Thank you for a fabulous stay, can't wait to stay there again. I would also recommend the restaurant they own."

Stayed a few nights","We stayed at Sharon’s cabin Jan 28-30th.
I don’t even know where to begin on how wonderful the cabin, surroundings, Don and Sharon were. The cabin was everything the listing described it to be, and more!
*beautiful sunrises off the deck
*quaint decor, with TONS of original artifacts from original owner of the home. This in NO WAY was “outdated” furnishings. (as Ashley, wrote in her comments) This was not the Ritz Carlton (whatever that fancy hotels name is lol) This was a farmhouse. And the decor was PERFECT!
* ANIMALS! We brought our grandson to pet the horses. Sharon and Don gave him 5 carrots to feed them. Plus deer, a pig, goats, and birds!
*Sharon and Don. You won’t find nicer, laid back people, than them. They were responsive to any questions we had. We had a wonderful visit with them, and learned a lot about the history, along with current information on Bartlesville.
We aren’t ones to normally write a review. We usually just let the owners know how our stay was. We felt we MUST leave a review on our stay.
When I was researching places to stay, I found this listing. Description and pictures looked great. I was going to book, then I saw a review by “Ashley”. I immediately went on to look at other listing, as that was a horrible review, and I first thought “thank god I read this before I booked”
Something made me go back and read the other reviews. I couldn’t find one single bad review. I decided to take the chance, and book with Sharon, despite the review by Ashley.
All I can say is this: Ashley’s review is not only egregiously untrue , but an obvious attack to try to hurt this listing. I gain nothing by my review; however, I feel Ashley was trying to gain something.
We will be back. Again and again.
I hope Airbnb will look at the totality of the reviews, and remove the one from Ashley. I don’t think they will, and that is why I’m mentioning her review in mine.

Stayed a few nights","Upon booking Sharon messages and then switched to her husband Don. Upon driving in a winter storm Don thought it was funny, and then continued to text me and say he wanted us to meet at his house to be shown to the cabin.
Accuracy of description of cabin is untruthful…
There is a security camera of front deck pole that also point in the home, they can see into. This is not self check in, there is also no lock on the door at all so you can’t lock 🔒 anything up. Don is a creep , and weirded us both out, to the point my husband had to basically tell him to leave we were tired after driving 17 hours. There house also sits very close to the cabin and they can see directly into the cabin , basically into the bathroom as well if you’re not sitting down on the toilet. There is also another cabin next to this one pretty close that can be seen into as well. Space heaters had to be used because there isn’t heat, you can use more then 1 water source at a time. Our stay was interrupted by Don texting us at 8 pm at night during our dinner date. His dogs that they leave outside all day and night bark constantly and they BOTH discriminated against my service dogs and clearly don’t know the laws regarding service animals. And Don was pretty rude about it. The furniture is extremely outdated and some also difference from what’s in the pictures also the bed upstairs one side of it sits on 2 bricks to hold it up as well. The stairs are extremely tight and small and I could barely get up them at 145 lbs. it was a super uncomfortable stay for us to the point we left early and went to a different air B and B to finish out our vacation/ experience."

Stayed a few nights",Loved the Cabin in the Woods! It was very peaceful and quiet in a picturesque location. We enjoyed reading about all of the antiques and special touches inside the cabin. Don and Sharon were great hosts and very welcoming. It felt like we knew them for years! We also loved eating at their restaurant Crossing 2nd in town. Delicious food and wonderful atmosphere. We highly recommend both the cabin and the restaurant!

I was super during my evenings and didn’t wanna check out. The place is quiet, there is wildlife and appears as photographed. You’ll have a relaxed weekend in the woods/cabin. The bed was comfy and there was plenty of linens. The hosts meet you at check in and show you to the property. Would recommend to anyone and I will be back."

Stayed a few nights","This cabin looks even better in person than in the photos. Our hosts were extremely hospitable and greeted us upon arrival, showing us around the cabin and explaining the area. I did not realize the cabin was full of quaint antiques. The hosts put together a binder of information including details about many of the antiques and how they were obtained. The sun coming through the stained glass was beautiful, and the upstairs deck was perfect to watch a sunrise or sunset while sipping coffee or tea (which are provided). The area is beautiful and secluded. I felt completely safe there. We enjoyed walking through the woods, and our hosts have mowed trails winding through the woods where you can explore (bring bug spray!!). I loved the birdwatching room that is enclosed in windows where you can sit in the bay area and look at the birdhouses. They even had a birdwatching book and binoculars. The entire place was spotless and clean. We appreciated the mini refrigerator, microwave, stove, bowls, plates, etc. Everything you could need. The bathroom was stocked with shampoo and body wash. As other people have said, the stairs leading to the loft/bedroom are very steep so be careful. The beds themselves were super comfortable. It is pitch black at night and you can hear the crickets outside, it was the best sleep I've gotten in a long time. I couldn't believe the amazing price for this magical space, it is truly a great deal. It was lovely spending quiet evenings in the main sitting area reading all the literature provided about the area. I honestly learned quite a lot. We worked a puzzle on the kitchen table and made some really good memories on this trip. The temperature was a bit hot but the hosts have provided window A/C units and fans which made everything comfortable. I highly recommend the cabin and look forward to my next visit."

There's so much history with the furniture in the cabin. The decor and everything else. Everything was amazing and to the point. The pond was spectacular. We had so much fun with the campfire at nights and stargazing. The bed was super comfy and the bathroom was neat and tidy. The instructions given were very easy to follow. You will never go wrong with this. Book it!!!! :) :)

Stayed a few nights","The cabin in the woods is truly a hidden little treasure! It was more than we expected and even better than the pictures displayed.
Sharon and Don are amazing hosts. They are there to meet you upon arrival and do an excellent job of explaining the check in process and giving us an overview of the property.
The cabin itself was breathtaking. It was so unique and unlike any others we have stayed in. You feel at peace and relaxed the minute you walk through the doors. It was fully equipped with everything you would need for a short or long term stay. They had plenty of extra towels, bedding and kitchen utensils should you need any. I will note that there is only a mini fridge however, it is actually quite large and has a separate freezer and fridge area. I was able to fit items for three full meals with snacks and drinks for the kids with no issues.
The cabin truly sits in the middle of the woods, with that we all know comes nature’s flying and crawling friends. Don and Sharon has plenty of Off solution on hand and sprays frequently so we were pleasantly surprised at how much bugs were NOT an issue...as I fully expected and was prepared to go to battle with a multitude of buzzing friends. Lighting at the cabin was great as well, we brought extra lanterns thinking it would be pitch black but again Sharon and Don did a fabulous job with lighting in and around the cabin.
My family and I just LOVED our stay. We even wanted to extend it but sadly they had more guests booked. I can not recommend this place enough. It’s perfect for a small intimate gathering but spacious enough to accommodate a family if needed.
The overall property was beautiful as well. We were so glad they allowed guests to explore as needed. Sharon even took my kids to pet the horses (which they can’t stop talking about) and we got to sit out on the second story balcony to get glimpse of the stars. They also have plenty of flat mowed land where you can lay out in the sun or run races with the kids like we did. There is even a fire pit for s’mores and a grill for a little late night BBQ if you should so choose.
This cabin is uniquely set up to become whatever the individual renter needs it to be and that’s what we love about it! The only negative thing I can say about this cabin is if you book it for only one night; you will be highly disappointed. Take my advice and reserve that weeks stay right now, I promise you won’t be disappointed!"

If you are looking for a beautiful, quiet, secluded location to stay outside of town, one that's squeaky clean, well-furnished, kitchen with everything needed for meal prep, & with great hosts, this is the place for you! The antiques in the cabin were fascinating! Don met us when we arrived & gave us a quick tour of the cabin that was very helpful. He reminded us to use caution on the steep stairs to the loft & we got along fine. Sharon had prepared a binder with info on local information that we referred to often. We spent a full day at Woolaroc (highly recommended) and another visiting all the renovated shops in Pawhuska, as well as a visit to the Drummond's lodge. When it was time to head home, we had a great visit with Sharon & she filled us in on the history of the cabin. Hope to be back in the spring to hike the property, explore Bartlesville & visit the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve when it greens up. Thank you, Sharon & Don, for making this wonderful cabin available to others!"

As someone who sleeps with a fan at home, it was really nice to have fans upstairs and downstairs for white noise while sleeping. The kitchen is super functional and has pots and pans for cooking, and theres a great covered porch out front perfect for sipping coffee in the morning. Sharon and Don are incredibly hospitable and responsive! This is a little slice of heaven at a heavenly price 🙌"

Stayed a few nights","The cabin in the woods is the cutest little rustic paradise you’ll find in Bartlesville. We came to visit Pawhuska and the Pioneer Woman’s Mercantile. But we also saw the Price Tower and Woolaroc and the Tallgrass Park with the Bison herd. There is tons to see, and this cabin is centrally located to see it all. We loved staying here. It is so quaint and beautifully decorated. There was a full kitchen with dishes and a stove and a microwave and mini fridge. There’s also coffee preparations available. The bed was very comfy. We got up early every day to go on adventures, and it was a great place to land in the afternoon for a nap before dinner and at night for a good sleep. Everything is super clean. I think the description of the cabin is very accurate for what you find when you get there. I just want to reiterate that the bedroom is kind of a loft situation, so if stairs aren’t your bag, you can sleep on the sofa bed downstairs. But we didn’t have any trouble with the loft bedroom. Sharon and Don are super nice, and we loved meeting them."

Stayed with kids","Sharon and Don are such great host! They are truly humble, easy to talk to, and just overall nice people. During the end of our stay, they were so nice as to let our children meet the horses, and even offered for them to take a little ride. They truly made our experience so enjoyable. The cabin had everything we needed, and such a wonderful charm about it. I especially love the book they had of things to do in the area! Very helpful! Another lovely touch was the binoculars and bird book to go bird watching. Very thoughtful additions. It was overall a peaceful area, and we would definitely recommend you book with them!"

It was in the country but just 10 minutes from Bartlesville and so close to a lot of the great things to see in Osage County. I would highly recommend this adorable cabin. It was decorated with beautiful antiques and felt so homey. It was so clean and tidy. I look forward to returning sometime for another peaceful get away .

I can’t begin to express the wonderful sanctuary her little cabin was for me. It truly was the highlight of my trip to be able to come back to her special place and relax and enjoy the beautiful surroundings. I especially loved drinking coffee on the front porch and listening to the abundant wild life.
Sharon was the most perfect host and made me feel very safe and comfortable while I was her guest!
Thank you Sharon for bringing such joy to a difficult situation. I highly recommend her place!"

The trails are well maintained for nature walks, and Sharon provides many perks that are not always included in Airbnb rentals: sightseeing information, excellent dining recommendations, binoculars and bird-watching guide, dishes, soap, towels, full kitchen with a mini-fridge, paper towels—even coffee! There’s no TV or WiFi, so there’s nothing to distract from enjoying the natural surroundings. My sweetheart and I didn’t want to ever leave, and we definitely intend to return for another romantic getaway."

She is not an AirBnB veteran so we wanted to make sure she had a good first experience with this, and having stayed with Taylor before we knew this was a safe bet. The place was immaculate, just as listed, and Taylor was super supportive of things like her not being able to figure out how to turn off the Nest thermostat when she left. Always a pleasure, and I'm sure we'll be back for a future stay!"

I didn’t realize the option for coffee would be a pour over coffee pot and stovetop kettle (I may have missed this information on the listing info) but you may find this helpful to know before you get there!

I want to give this five stars, but we ran into issues 3 out of our 4 night stay. So I’m giving it 4.5 stars. Quiet time was listed as 10pm to 10am, however we were woken up in the middle of the night several times by the upstairs tenants. (Host also owns the upstairs loft.) I know host doesn’t have control over other peoples schedules, and he did his absolute best to rectify the problem. Which I am very appreciative of. So I’m just giving a heads up for people booking, if the upstairs tenants don’t adhere to the quiet time rule, it can be very challenging to get a good nights rest."

Stayed a few nights","Taylor’s cozy cottage downtown is more than cozy. The industrial modern style is very comfortable and I felt homey. The space is open and restful. Taylor was very friendly, responsive, and informative.
I ventured downtown my first day. Most downtown shopping and restaurants are within 15 mins walking. I went to Painted Horse for an early dinner and then to Cooper and Mill Brewery for some craft beer (they also offer other drinks). Cooper and Mill had an event that supports local artists.
My second day was not full of adventure but definitely quiet. I slept in late and the bed was spacious and comfortable. I spent the day in with the exception of taking a walk around the neighborhood. I used the pour over coffee container (which I loved) and spent most of the day reading by the fireplace.
Checkout was easy and straightforward. I had to leave early morning and it was not an issue. I enjoyed my stay with Taylor and loved the cozy cottage. I would undoubtedly stay with Taylor again!"

The hosts do allow you to park in the garage (what we ended up doing) which helped us avoid having issues with the driveway.

Group trip","My trip was for a surprise 80th birthday celebration for my mom. I requested to check in a little early or to at least put cake that was purchased in town in the refrigerator. I was told by one of the host it would be no problem. Then I got a message from co-host that if I checked in early there would be additional fee. I only requested to check in approximately 2 hours early! The house was extremely warm inside upon arrival. This is a 2 level home with only 1 a/c unit. Two of the guests went to hotel because of the heat. The Murphy bed did not operate properly, handyman came to try and fix. Had to put brick on leg frame to keep bed from folding all the way back up. Could not get front door to lock each time leaving had to go out garage door and use the garage door opener. I feel the property could use a little more maintenance up keep. Our group managed with any obstacles we encountered."

It was very clean and just like the pictures, and communication was quick and easy."

The neighborhood is active, well located (note, you'll need a car to go anywhere in B'ville) and safe, lots of friendly neighbors. The deck was lovely-- perfect for star-gazing at night (very little light pollution) and birding in the morning. Beds were comfortable, black-out shades great, galley kitchen well-stocked and easy to cook in, plenty of linens, toilet paper, soap, shampoo, etc. We did note some things we needed (one of us is mobility challenged, and there were issues in the entryway and tub/shower), but David was very responsive and I'm quite confident he will respond to our comments. Overall, we had a lovely stay, hope really hope to stay here again!"

David & Amber were very good with the little details and timely with their communication. The property was stocked so well—coffee pods, laundry soap, paper towels and make-up remover wipes just to name a few!
The location was perfect, close to shopping, movies, eating places and only 30 minutes from the Mercentile.
There were a total of 8 adult women and we had plenty of room. However, I wouldn’t plan on using the bunk beds (especially the top) if you are an adult—it’s a very tight fit.
I hope to return to the area and if so, will plan to stay here again!"

Overall, we enjoyed our time at the Airbnb as we celebrated a University of Tulsa graduation. The Airbnb in Tulsa that I had booked several months ago decided to cancel our reservation 31 days before the we were due to arrive. Trying to find a place big enough for our family that didn't cost a small fortune was interesting. It was impossible to find anything in Tulsa for that graduation weekend. Everything was booked or way beyond my budget. Fortunately, I found this place and the host was wonderful to work with.
The place has a huge backyard and lots of indoor space for gatherings. We had fun staying there and celebrating the big event."

Stayed a few nights","Pictures don't do this place justice. It has so much character and is perfectly clean as well. We loved seeing all the unique furnishings and finishes. We've stayed at plenty of Airbnbs and this one is our favorite by far. Our toddler loved the little toy bin in the sun room and was stoked to go watch the cows and horses that are just steps from the front door in the mornings!
We especially appreciated how well-stocked it was. It's so nice to have plenty of towels, lots of coffee and creamer, and all the toiletries you could possibly forget when flying into town. Rhonda, the host, stopped by to say Hi as well and she was very welcoming and sweet.
We will 100% stay here next time we visit our in-laws down the street and recommended they have other visitors stay there as well! If you're browsing the small selection of Airbnbs in the Bartlesville area, this is the one to pick!"

Stayed with kids","The Yocham's Ponderosa is a charming place to call home away from home for whatever duration your stay might be. The Yochams take self-evident pride in providing tremendous guest service above and beyond expectations. The Ponderosa is very clean and well cared for, and carries all the charm and creature comforts of home in a familiar way that is all at once inviting, welcoming, and comforting, much like coming home after a long day to one's own home!
The rustic southern decor and inspirational God-centric adornments add an even greater degree of familiarity by subtly reminding one's subconscious of one's American roots and heritage, and are a subtle (but effective) nod to the moral and ethical standards of the hosts.
Needless to say, when you stay at the Yocham's Ponderosa you're the honored guests of some old friends or family, not just a ""customer"". 10/10, would gladly stay again!"

Stayed with kids","We had a chance to visit right before Christmas. We had family come visit and we wanted a short overnight trip to get out of Tulsa. We decide that Bartlesville would be a great place for us to go visit.
We enjoyed our stay, and the house was great. Staying in a house made the trip feel far more special than staying at a hotel. The house was great, and we enjoyed drinking hot chocolate while playing the board games at the house. Our 4 year old fell in love with a Christmas bouncing reindeer toy that was left out. He immediately felt at home once he saw it.
The house is located on a property full of animals, and the kids loved getting to walk up and see horses up close. That was my daughters favorite part of the whole trip.
I would encourage anyone looking for a relaxing place to stay to book their visit at Rhonda's place, it's especially great for families."

Group trip","This townhouse was great for six people (three couples), as everyone got their own bedroom AND bathroom. The house was large and we all felt like we had plenty of privacy with the bedrooms being on separate levels than the common area, and the upstairs two on opposite ends of the hall. The common area was very spacious and accommodating to large groups as well, the six of us were able to spend time together without feeling like we were on top of each other. The house was very clean and everything was in working order. There were plenty of towels/linens. A couple more coffee cups would have been nice to have, as well as backup toilet paper rolls, but not having those didn’t impact our weekend stay at all. We didn’t cook any meals at the house, so I’m not sure what was available as far as pans or dishes other than drinking glasses. The host responded quickly when I messaged.
I would definitely stay here again, and do recommend this listing to anyone looking for a Bartlesville rental."

Cons: the layout is odd; there is no bathroom on the main floor where the kitchen and living room are. We visited during a very cold spell and the bedroom on the main floor was extremely cold. The nonstick pans are heavily scratched and should be replaced. The master bedroom comforter smelled bad and the washer stopped working due to the freezing weather BUT the host was responsive and unit very clean."

We thought a few extra tv's in the house would be nice, in the bedrooms, as opposed to just one tv in the living room for everyone. It's nice to unwind in your own room after a long day, and a tv in the room would have been nice. We also didn't appreciate having to strip the sheets off the beds and take all the laundry to the laundry room before we checked out, since we were in a hurry to get to the airport. That just seemed like it should have been taken care of. Otherwise, the house is perfect and we enjoyed our stay. We would stay there again."

We were in town visiting family and are so happy we stayed at Gramercy. The location is fantastic, walk to restaurants and close to grocery store and Starbucks. The unit is very cute and homey and beautifully decorated. The fully stocked kitchen is such a plus and the clubhouse is fantastic. Far exceeds our expectations, we will defiantly be back."

Stayed one night","Simply put, this was the best Airbnb experience we've had to date. We were here for one night as we made our way across the country during a long road trip and we wished we could have stayed longer!
Amanda and Matthew have done an incredible job with this space and the results are stunning. Every single detail has been thought of and works well. We loved the bathroom and had a very comfortable night's sleep. The kitchen is amazing and we were sorry that we didn't have a chance to cook while at Talo.
There is a lot of interesting information about the house and farm to read, as well as a book with good recommendations for the city. I'm not sure if we'll have a reason to return to Bartlesville, but we'll absolutely stay here if we do. A true gem!"

Backyard is fully fenced in and the deck is decked out with a ton of string lights. It’s a lovely place to hang out when the weather is nice. Everything in the house is nicely furnished and comfortable. Check in was easy using a digital keypad (host sent the passcode ahead of time). Hosts are friendly and very responsive. Speedy WiFi that tested at around 150 Mbps download and 12.5 Mbps upload on my phone. Quite a numbers of restaurants and diners within an easy 10 minute drive. All in all we had a great stay and would recommend it to anyone visiting Bartlesville or the surrounding area!

Since one of us was a chef, she enjoyed all the pots, pans, dishes and large oven to make the meals for 2 nights dinners!! One of the other's in our party is a home gardener; her whole front yard is full of flowers, fruits and veggies from spring to fall; she would love to see your yarden in the height of the produce season! All the bedrooms had a special touch as well as a beautiful throw on each bed. Beds were very comfortable. Any questions we had were answered in a timely way. Thank you for providing a wonderful place to relax and enjoy our time together while traveling! We hope to return!!"

Front and back porches were decorated for fall with beautiful pumpkins and gourds.
They have put a lot of thought into curating the books and cookbooks collection.

Stayed a few nights","The quality of this place is beyond expectations, it is a beautiful cozy home. You are greeted with everything you could need in this gourmet kitchen. Knives and utensils that were high end, simple yet elegant pots, pans, cups and plates… the decor keeps you checking it out, reading book titles and scanning through as many as I could get through was a day well spent. The windows are large, wonderful and invite in so much natural light, what a joy! It is in a great location, comfortable, clean, safe neighborhood, and everything you need close by! A grocery store is a few minutes down the road. All kinds of food nearby if you like that, but best of all you can buy fresh veggies from the owner right here in the front yard! The greens made a wonderful salad, bursting with a lovely freshness you only get from fresh picked garden veggies, grown with care. We hope to return here often and enjoy the Finnish decor, such finest simplicity and so tastefully displayed. We will Return."

The kitchen was spotless and extremely well furnished, the furniture was comfortable, the beds were comfortable, the bathroom was compact but clean and efficient, and everything worked as it was supposed to. One suggestion might be to offer a few of the shelves outside the bathroom for toiletries. It was fun to sit on the back deck and watch the new plants and flowers flourish, and the vegetable garden in the front yard was beautiful and looked bountiful. The house is located in a quiet neighborhood and close to everything Bartlesville has to offer. One more suggestion might be to bring your passwords with you for your favorite TV apps. Next time we are in Bartlesville, we plan to make this our home away from home."

The house is beautifully decorated and is so very comfortable. You will want to find wall paper for you own home. The kitchen is a cook's dream and is ready to prepare a gourmet meal. Sitting on the back deck during the rainstorm was zen. The bed was comfortable and the linens soft. Plenty of towels. Listening to vintage records on the turntable was another level of relaxation. The neighborhood is safe and quiet. Easy drive to the many restaurants in Bartlesville. The information notebook was detailed and much appreciated. This will be become my go to place when I return to Bartlesville to see my grandchildren."
