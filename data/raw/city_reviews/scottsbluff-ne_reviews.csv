Stayed one night","This place was good for our one night stay. Beds were comfortable, clean place, quiet neighborhood. Parking needs to have designated space as both stalls were occupied by the other side of duplex. Brian did go above when we left a piece of equipment at the place and he mailed it back to us. Overall I recommend staying here."

Stayed a few nights","This is a very efficient space very well situated close to downtown and the local Walmart just five minutes away., it’s a residential area with light traffics during the day, wry quiet at night. The house is compact and well thought out with new appliances quality furnishings with tasteful little details. During my stay there was a nice Christmas tree set in the corner of the living room! Parking is off road and the house has very good security features. The yard has a nice fire pit and hot tub within a private fenced area. The owner was very responsive and friendly. Would I stay here again or recommend to my own friends? Absolutely! It’s good value, very clean and in a convenient location."

Cleanliness is paramount to me, and this Airbnb surpassed all my expectations. The entire space was immaculate, with a fresh scent that permeated the air. Every corner was spotless, with attention given to even the tiniest details. It truly felt like the hosts had gone above and beyond to ensure a pristine environment for their guests.
Upon entering, the cozy ambiance enveloped me. The thoughtful decor choices, such as warm hues and tasteful artwork, created an inviting atmosphere that instantly put me at ease. The living area was tastefully furnished with plush sofas, making it a perfect spot to unwind after a long day. They hottub and fire pit were the cherry on top after a long day spent traveling."

I really appreciated the refrigerator in the bedroom as well. Luna was a wonderful dog to offer her home too!
Your home was very calming. If I had any suggestions, I could have used a bit more light with my eyes. I wasn't able to work with the TV without having to had asked for assist and it wasn't that important. We have DISH at our home so wasn't familiar with this TV setup....this wasn't the first home I've had any concerns related to the TV. Just sharing with others the TV is not of DISH or Direct TV...I am rather old school but certain most people would know how to run the TV. The bathroom sharing worked out fine but just so others know, you maybe sharing a bathroom with a single or a couple.
I had a great time in Scottsbluff and I appreciate your warm hospitality. I'm sure others will too."

Stayed about a week","I stayed at Sheryll and Jim's place for a week while working at the hospital. This is a bedroom with a very comfortable memory foam queen sized bed, a bedside table, bedside dresser, sitting chair, large closet with a dresser inside, two luggage racks and a small drink size refrigerator in the bedroom. The bathroom is just down the hallway and shared with another guest who rents the bedroom across from you. Sheryll and Jim use the bathroom in the basement. The shared space is a sitting room/living room, huge kitchen/dining room (one large space), outdoor porch, fenced in back yard and two street parking spaces outside. The community is a lovely subdivision where children still play outside and couples go for walks. Sheryll keeps you updated on all family activities that will be happening that week. I was able to witness a children's birthday party and participate in a girl's night Bunko game (dice game) when someone no-showed ( I won 20 dollars!) I was less than 10 minutes from the hospital and it worked great for me."

Miraculously it worked into their schedule. They are both so gracious and fun to visit with even concerning their own world travels. The room is spacious, the bed very comfortable and the hospitality is superb. It is so close to the Bluffs also for a great tourist attraction. We will gladly tell others to look them up for a stay. Thank you again Sheryl and Jim. With much appreciation, Zelda and Mark"

Our host was in the driveway, so we visited with her. She gave us the tour and explained things to us then. This was great, because they were leaving for an event before our check-in time and would be back late that night. The neighborhood was very quiet and the Temper medic mattress allowed us a great nights sleep just like ours at home! Only regret that we had to leave too early the next morning to allow time to visit with our hosts!"

She takes care of her guests, she communicate with me in the morning before leaving the house. Breakfast is always offered even though I'm not a breakfast fan. And if you need help with whatsoever, she's willing to help you. she offered me ride back and forth to my orientation site, she showed me around town, dropped me at the airport. I accompany her and her grand daughter for ice cream which was fun. Amazing and stylish place to stay in Scottsbluff, absolutely lovely I every way. the house and the entire place was extremely stylish, clean and green. The room was clean and has this cool calming energy to it. The mattress is soft, very comfortable and suiting. Me being a morning person I always sleep pass my wake up time due to the comfortability of the mattress. There is just so much I can say about my staying at Mrs Shery home, I'll submit y saying it was way more than what I was expected being my first time there. THANKS THANKS THANKS"

Stayed a few nights","House is split level with stairs up and stairs down, so if that's an issue, be aware. They do have an absolutely lovely Boxer who is your instant friend. You are staying in either the bedrooms on either side of the master bedroom, all sharing one bathroom, or using the two-bed basement room with an adjoining bath. You are treated like a member of the family and encouraged to use refrigerator. Inside and outside are amazingly decorated -- this house can hold a lot of people (they had five kids and are now empty nesters) in different areas without impinging on anyone's personal space. Lovely hostess-supplied gift baskets with toiletries, and tempur pedic mattresses! I could not have asked for a better stay in someone's home. Sheryl even cooked breakfast for everyone every day, taking everyone's dietary restrictions into account. I highly recommend this B&B."

Stayed with kids","I can't tell you how happy I am with this rental experience. From the moment I booked the reservation to the end of my trip, Lawrence was in communication with me. I rented the house for a week when my daughter was getting married. He allowed us to have family dinners there as well as the rehearsal dinner at the lake house ( as my grand kids called it) The open space of the living area & kitchen made it easy to prepare meals and entertain. The bed rooms were comfortable. The main bedroom was gorgeous. The back yard was huge. The pictures don't seem to show how much space there is to entertain. There are more than enough for large gatherings. He provides tables & chairs for us. There are two fire pits which the kid enjoyed making smores one evening. Lawrence went above & beyond as a host. You can tell he truly enjoys sharing his family home. He even made a point to stop by to check on us. You won't be disappointed with this house."

Group trip","Id like to give a shout out to the host Lawrence, he was very responsive and there was a few issues being the first tenants to be in this AirBnB recently renevated. I let him know about the issues and he was out there trying to make it feel like home. A decent sized piece of property to play horse shoes and corn hole he also has a fire pit to hang around and have a grand ole time. Also considering its winter the lake is dried up but i can only imagine the summer time when the lake is filled up. Not to far from Scotts Bluff which is a decent size town to get your amenities but very quiet neighborhood its very safe. I'd say bring your family and friends if your wanting to escape reality for a little bit."

Her house is very clean, the beds are super comfy, and the kitchen was outfitted with everything we needed. Donna even has some basic food items in the pantry! An added bonus is being able to park in the garage. We also loved how close this place is to everything in Scottsbluff. We even loved that Scooters is very close. I would stay here again if I am ever in Scottsbluff."

There is a TV and the WiFi is excellent. The home is more spacious than the pictures lead you to believe. Wonderful home and close to food, shopping, etc! Do not hesitate to book this property."

Some may consider parts of the house ‘outdated’; but its well-maintained and so charming...I hope they never ‘update’ it! It was so comfortable and welcoming, we were anxious to get back after our day out exploring Scottsbluff to spend more time there. The water pressure in the shower was top-notch and the towels were the fluffiest, softest towels I’ve ever used. The internet is super fast and we enjoyed the apps on the tv. Wonderful stay!!"

My one suggestion would be some kind of covers for the small windows in the bedrooms. We had a hard time sleeping in because the sun was rising very early every morning.

Stayed a few nights","The house was very clean, cool set-up, comfortable, with plenty of room for the three of us. Located in a nice neighborhood, near to all the popular monuments or just a short drive away. Kitchen was well supplied with pans & utensils. Handmade soaps were a nice detail. Donna added a new gas grill; we weren’t prepared to use it but I would definitely go back and grill some grass-fed Western Nebraska steaks on that bad boy.
My two kids (21 & 16 y.o.) went for a long weekend to get away from Omaha during the pandemic. Figured we could see the sites on a scenic drive across Nebraska on Hwy 91 and Hwy 2 and around Scottsbluff with minimal risk, and it worked out just as we hoped it would. Donna’s house and her hospitality made the Scottsbluff part of the trip easy. I’d love to go back after the pandemic when we don’t have to social distance and would definitely stay at Donna’s place again."

I was able to message her and explain to her that I was in a car accident and that my car had been damaged due to hitting an Elk. She was so understanding and kind. She didn’t worry about not having someone stay at the AirBnB. She worried and cared about me as a person and wanted to make sure I was okay. That was the biggest blessing in this huge moment of chaos and anxiety to know that someone far away cared. She is an amazing person and I feel so blessed to have been able to have her there via the AirBnB app. She was so understanding. Amber thank you, from the bottom on my heart am so sorry I wasn’t able to enjoy your beautiful Airbnb because of my new friend who damaged my vehicle. Am so thankful though that you were there in this time of chaos. Anyone reading this long review make sure you stay at this amazing Lady’s AirBnB for me. Thank you again Amber. You are a Blessing!"

Stayed a few nights","This was a “return home” for us. We used to live in Scottsbluff and still have family and friends in the area. The apartment was clean and had lots of room. We loved it! Such a convenient location too! Gas station, WalMart, Chili’s , Wonderful House Chinese, other restraints and Home Depot right there. The nearby park was very nice. Also, our old favorite Taco Town close by. We also could not leave town without visiting Scotty’s Drive-in for a Cinnamon Coke. We visited the monument and visited wile a very friendly ranger. Short drive to Chimney rock was also nice."

Plenty of furniture but all on the smaller side and beds were very comfortable on the firm side. My only complaint is if you have sensitivity to scents it might not be for you. The laundry detergent was sented, the trash bags were sented, and they had a very strong plug in. All in the place was as expected and a great price for the space."

Having the carport with the 10+” of snow that arrived was especially nice. It was nice having Netflix in the evenings as well. Amber was so responsive and polite and we appreciated the work she has done to make the Airbnb a great place for a short or long term stay. Definitely recommend and will look to stay there again when visiting.

There’s also plenty of stores, Safeway and so much more nearby. For one person, it was so spacious - even two couples or a family would be more than comfortable here."

Stayed a few nights","My cousin and I spent 2 nights here. It was fine for a short stay as we didn't spend a lot of time in the apartment. There were good and not-so-good things about ""Cozy Apartment"".
I have stayed in dozens of AirBnb's and have friends that are hosts...and in comparison this apartment could be taken to a new level with a few tweeks in terms of communication, maintenance amenities, and decor.
Good: 1/Apartment was roomy 2/Location was central 3/Carport was an added bonus.
Not so Good:
1/Communication:
Had the host checked in with us after arrival a few issues perhaps could have been remedied.
2/Maintenance.
Bath tub drain toggle would not close so was unable to take a bath. There was an older/rusty faucet in bathroom.
The exterior entry door to apartment was filthy (not very welcoming or hygienic)
Hot water was adequate and was unable to turn it up to be hotter.
3/Amenities:
Kitchen had a Keurig machine but no pods or any other type of coffee maker.
No dish towels, only one dish cloth. Fortunately, we found a roll of paper towels under the counter.
No amenities such as coffee, creamer, salt and pepper, etc for even a one night stay.
Found big bottle of body and shampoo in bath cabinet but had to search.
4/Decor:
Apartment didn't feel cozy, it felt more like a Motel 6 with a kitchen. Very basic decor without a lot of attention to details or aesthetics.
No place to hang or put coats, etc inside the door.
2nd bedroom had very flat, old pillows and the tiny, disproportionate bedside lamp was inadequate. No tables or benches to lay things out.
Upgraded curtains would make bedrooms much more inviting.
There were multiple screws in the walls with nothing hanging from them.
Overall, it was okay, but nothing special. I think for the price, we could have done better perhaps at other Airbnb's or at a motel in the area."

Stayed one night","We loved this place. They really did a great job of making you feel welcome and it didn't feel like we were staying in someone else's house; it felt like we were staying in a really cool, tiny house that was designed exactly for what it is being used for.
The place was squeaky-clean and well appointed. It was fun to go into town and grab a meal and a drink and then a really easy drive back 'home'. Hosts were very nice and super helpful, although we really didn't need anything because instructions were easy and they've pretty much figured out the whole hosting 'thing'.
The weather was really nice so we got to open some windows. The cows in the adjacent field were awesome to listen to; the cars on the highway were audible but not overpowering.
Would love to go back some day."

Stayed with kids","Amber & Jace's place was a wonderful place to stay while we were visiting family! Before we even arrived, Amber reached out to connect about our upcoming stay, asking about anything we needed. She was so personable in the communications and went as far as to set up the pull-out for our daughter, since our travel was delayed and we were arriving unexpectedly late in the night. This was above and beyond, and I could tell she really cared about our experience.
The tiny home itself was so lovely and well-outfitted, as well as quiet, private, and comfortable - a great place of respite after each day spending time with grieving family members. A bonus for me (since I like to cook), was a beautifully filled rack of spices, so I didn't have to shop for those things while on our trip.
We look forward to staying again on future family visits in this ""home away from home."" It was just perfect for us! :o)"

Stayed a few nights","We loved this Air bnb!!
Everything was labeled and organized so finding a speaker, blankets, washer/dryer, the coffee pot was awesome. The “open can” trashcan feature was a hit for all of us. The beds were very comfortable and for someone who travels multiple times a month, good nights sleep was awesome. The value of this space was beyond excellent.
Our check in/out process was easy and communication with Troy was timely and helpful. I felt like if I needed anything, they were only a text away. The decor was hip and the tributes to our community was welcomed with nostalgia and pride! We found the yearbooks!!
Thank you again! We are sure to stay here again on our next trip back to Bearcat Country!"

Stayed a few nights","Holly’s rental is exactly as described and shown in the photos. We had a great and comfortable stay. Spacious rooms, clean home, plenty of towels, laundry access and bottled water in the refrigerator. Appreciated (personally) that the beds were firm (soft mattresses wreak havoc on my back). Quiet neighborhood with quick access to restaurants. My mom and I traveled here for a family funeral and found the rental to be a better deal than a hotel plus we had the comforts of home and our own rooms for privacy. We were so otherwise occupied with extended family, the funeral and area sightseeing that we never sat down in the nice living room or watched TV! No long list of check out protocols (we know to do our dishes, empty garbage, and strip bed linens) which was nice as we were in a hurry. Holly was responsive to messages and gave us recommendations for restaurants. I don’t know when I’ll be back in western Nebraska, but I would recommend this place to anyone considering it."

perfect for this. We appreciated the basket of breakfast bars and snacks, as well as the Keurig coffee — this helped us get on the road early when leaving. Some have mentioned the neighborhood, but we had absolutely no problems, and did like the off street parking which was illuminated by a streetlight and a next door neighbor’s light. This was our very first trip through Nebraska, and we’d certainly stay here again if going through Scottsbluff."

Worked out fine though, as the cleaner was in the place getting it ready for us, so as soon as they left, we were set. Really appreciate the attention to detail, with it being freshly cleaned just before check-in. Will for sure check for availability of his place again when in Scottsbluff again. Thanks"

East Overland (location) can be sketchy, but you'll find no better deal, AirBnB or hotel, than this place here. The house itself is very clean, and provides all the accommodations anyone would need. Excellent communication from the Host, as well as a leisurely check-in/check-out. Overall, a perfect and affordable stay, and hands-down the best in town."

They were so kind yet not present in our space. Linda had homemade Biscotti, Wayne shoveled the snow from the walk and my car! Such pleasant hosts and the place was immaculate! I'd return."

They also gave us so many recommendations and travel tips, and shared some of their stories with us.
And the bed — ah! It was one of the comfiest I’ve slept in, ever. The pillows and the room in general was so comfy.
Everything was very clean as well. The shower was also very nice!
If we ever find ourselves back in NE, this will be a must-stay-again.
Thank you Wayne and Linda!❤️"

The home and area were quiet and peaceful with super neighbors, as well as close to area attractions and restaurants. We had a full schedule for our visit to the area, but would have loved to enjoy more time in their company out on the beautiful and inviting patio… We definitely hope to come back and would recommend their place highly."

Stayed one night","Originally, I booked with Linda and Wayne for 3-days. They and their airbnb, being so amazing, my friend, their guest, enjoyed his stay so much l asked for another day! Linda and Wayne were able to let me book one more day. YAY! The Gering Scottsbluff area has many beautiful scenic, and historical places to visit and enjoy. There is everything, from great museums, to badlands, where there are fossils, to some serious Native American, cowboy and pioneer history...art and artifacts... Linda and Wayne are eager to help their guests make the most of their time in the area, if sight-seeing or recreational sports, like boating, camping or hiking is anything someone might be interested in ? They are above and beyond helpful and kind. They will always respect your privacy and space too, if you just want to sleep and move on... Their airbnb is beautiful, accommodating and well-equipped. An incredible value for your money. I cannot wait to book them again in the future. 🌻"

Stayed a few nights","There are so many great things to say about Linda & Wayne & their FANTASTIC airbnb, that I do not know where to start?
Upon arrival, I was immediately taken aback by the freshly cut lawn:& flowers. (This needs to be seen in person. The landscaping & house design is stunning.) Walking up their steps is like coming to a palace. Arriving on time at: 3:00 p.m. check-in, the lovely and gracious hostess, Linda, opened the door. She had the biggest smile & welcoming words. We felt important & welcome. Everything inside their gorgeous airbnb was sparkling and pristine. The colorful decor could not have been more pleasing to the eye. The view from the homes back, felt like being in the country, so pretty! The room upstairs is darling. It was thoughtfully set up with water, etc. The bathroom, & laundry room, were also set up perfectly. The host & hostess are so accommodating & helpful. My friend's stay, was a HAPPY experience he will remember all of his life; it was that good!: Thank You!"

Stayed with kids","Our party of 10+ had a fantastic time at Brian’s AirBnB. The house was beyond comfortable, and there was so much space for everyone to spread out without feeling like we were on top of each other. The kids loved the small lake with the paddle boat, as well as the gaming room and table. The house was clean, and quiet. No one bothered us, and we had an amazing time. We will definitely be staying here again.
My mother in law:
At almost 70 years old, it was a blessing to be able to get the family together under one roof. There was plenty of things for the family to do and keep busy without anyone wanting to leave the premises to find entertainment. The airBB provided so much for the family to do together. Everyone had a very very good time.
Negative: there isn’t much to say that is negative other than the coffee pot and tabletop cooker were dirty when we arrived. It was easy enough to clean up."

This place is a dream spot for kids of all ages - shuffelboard, foosball, ping pong, electronic game table, the slide, popcorn maker the list goes on and on. We saw lots of geese and deer! Plenty of room for everyone to spread out and the kitchen is great. Even has a pack/play and high chair for the little ones. Wish we had known about this place before and will definitely come back."

Stayed with kids","Our Christmas gathering with our immediate family - including my parents, siblings, and their adorable kids - was made truly special thanks to Brian's wonderful abode. His place wasn't just spacious and immaculate; it also radiated festive cheer with tasteful Christmas decorations that made us feel at home.
What set our experience apart was Brian's hospitality. He wasn't just responsive; he anticipated our needs. For instance, he thoughtfully provided a high-chair without us even asking. This gesture of kindness left us deeply impressed. Furthermore, Brian showed incredible understanding and flexibility towards our family dynamics. He graciously allowed us to host a few relatives - uncles, aunts, and cousins - during the holidays, making our family reunion all the more memorable.
We are grateful for the warmth and comfort Brian's place provided, making our Christmas celebration one for the books. A heartfelt thank you, Briann, for going above and beyond!"

Stayed with kids","13 of us stayed at Brian’s place for 3 days over Thanksgiving and we had a blast! The property was just as described! The pool table, ping pong, foosball, shuffleboard were all in great working order and provided hours of fun!!
The kitchen was completely stocked with just about every utensil and cooking ware required to prepare our Thanksgiving feast! Except a potato masher lol!!! But we made do.
The area is of course beautiful with views of the western Nebraska bluffs. We made a trek to the Scottsbluff National Monument; the 1.5 mile hike to the tunnel is worth the effort.
I personally enjoyed being able to see the coal trains passing just on the horizon and hearing their horn faintly in the background.
Really nothing bad to say! Exceeded our expectations.
Brian is a kind and responsive host!
Thank you Brian for making this a memorable Thanksgiving with family!"
