Stayed with kids","Michelle’s home was perfect for our little family—comfortable, cozy, well laid out, and clean. Would recommend her place to families as there are outlet covers throughout the house, with a small shelf of toys and games to keep little ones busy. Beds were notably comfortable. Location is great for easy food options and grocery shopping, and we walked to Starbucks in the morning. Halfway through our stay our whole family agreed we’d never book any other Airbnb when staying in Cortland—Michelle’s place hit all the marks and then some!"

The pictures do not do the space justice, it is truly a beautiful and extremely clean home. I have had terrible experiences staying at hotels in Cortland before so I’m so glad that I found Michele’s home and had such a pleasant experience. I would highly recommend for anyone visiting Cortland!"

Stayed a few nights","This is the old-fashioned kind of Airbnb that is actually someone’s home for part of the year. That means it’s ready to live in comfortably. Michele has gone beyond that, providing things like a wrapped toothbrush and travel-sized toothpaste, luxurious towels, packets of half and half for your coffee, and a hook everywhere you want to hang something. The house has been refurbished to a high level of fit and finish. The backyard is private but not finished for use. Parking next to the house worked for us but we had to back out onto the sidewalk to leave safely, so I would recommend parking on the side street. The street in front is busy but we couldn’t hear it from the bedroom and we slept well. Thanks, Michele!"

I would definitely rent this house again.

The home itself must be a century old but it was fully updated which made our stay a comfortable one. While we were only there for a night, you could easily do an extended stay here.
Thank you Thomas for the use of your space and helping to restore our faith in Airbnbs!"

Thomas's little house in Cortland was perfect! It is tucked back off the street. Hardwood floors and original woodwork. Clean and tasteful. Well-stocked kitchen. Well maintained. Quiet! This was a last-minute find, and Thomas responded immediately. Couldn'thave been more perfect!"

It was a few blocks from the campus and walkable to quite a few places to eat. We enjoyed having a little space to relax without being stuck in one hotel room and the kitchen was super convenient (teenagers never stop eating!!). The host was very accommodating and made efforts to make you feel even more at home, leaving some bagels, soaps, etc. It was just very comfortable. I also appreciated the host responding over messager when we had questions about the property or the internet and letting me know that I forgot a change of clothes in one of the dresser drawers. If we're ever in town again I would definitely contact Thomas and stay here."

You have a private driveway and it is very quiet. The special touches provided are the real treat; candies placed on every bed, bagels, cream cheese, pastry treats, water, k-cup and regular coffee pot coffee. The towels are soft and not the harsh hotel feeling towels you find elsewhere. A really nice kitchen and the tv's are big with crystal clear pictures. Our recommendation.... keep doing exactly what you are doing and people will enjoy it as we have!"

Everything was clean and spotless.
Thomas was a wonderful host - always answered any question as quickly as possible and very kind and respectful.
The neighborhood is quiet and quaint. So close to downtown, and very easy to find anything else we needed. The front porch was a super bonus - loved sitting outside in the early morning.
We absolutely enjoyed our stay and are looking forward to coming back."

It is tastefully decorated and pristinely clean…I know personally how hard it is to keep up with houses that are older, but this one is SO clean! The quirks and charms of this house are lovely, woodwork abounds. The kitchen is brightly lit and spacious, with good appliances and plenty of counter space. There are numerous electrical and USB outlets, which was much appreciated. The basement is neat as a pin and bone dry, with washer and dryer available. There is a bit of yard surrounding, and it was quiet, shaded, and seemed that one is secluded even in the midst of the city. Absolutely lovely to sip coffee on the porch or walk about the yard and take in the morning sun! Thomas is a helpful and responsive host, and has thought of every comfort. It is a well cared for and welcoming house, it feels like a home away from home!"

Stayed one night","Anthony and Amy are absolutely wonderful hosts and communicated about everything on our trip. They are accessible, warm and friendly. Delightful.
The apartment is beyond stunning. Absolutely gorgeous. It is a 3rd floor loft above the Dark Horse Tavern on Main Street. It is VERY VERY COOL. Everything on Main Street is within walking distance and SUNY Cortland is only maybe a mile walk away.
The apartment is huge. The bathroom is gigantic and deluxe. Beautiful dark wood floors, Keurig with coffee, and even laundry just make this place perfect. Just a beautiful place. Truly.
A parking spot is provided directly behind the bar. Anthony will meet you with the key.
It should be noted that the apartment requires climbing narrow stairs to the 3rd floor.
Bar noise at 1am should also be considered. Anthony does disclose it when booking. There were no secrets as to what to expect. I, however, did not remember all the fun noises college kids make, beer bottles, car alarms and screaming. Lol."

The kitchen had everything we needed and the center island was the perfect place for us to gather and hang out. The sectional couch is super comfy too. The bedroom is huge with a king size bed that was. Very comfortable. We will be booking this place every year if its not scooped up by someone else first. Well worth the $$$ spent.

Its above The Darkhorse so depending on when you stay you may hear a bit of music coming up but we never had an issue with it. The kitchen is huge and has everything you need to cook and a Keurig with pods and we even had creamer in the fridge! There are many stairs to get to the loft but that's our exercise so again no problem for us. Eat at Harry Tony's downstairs as its a great restaurant owned by the owner of this loft!! Enjoy.

The place was also exactly what we wanted. Everything was clean when we arrived, and we loved the view of the slopes from the living room. We went in the spring which was beautiful, but hope to come back in the winter to enjoy the winter sports. Everything felt very cozy and welcoming which made us feel right at home. It is in a more rural area which felt very peaceful and relaxing, while being 10 minutes from a Walmart and close enough to Syracuse for a city day (Definitely try ‘The Ice Cream Stand’ in Syracuse for some great ice cream). We had a great time and would definitely recommend it!"

When we first got there, there was no hot water on the main level but as soon as I messaged them, someone showed up to fix it right away. They really are great hosts! We had 11 people in the house and there was plenty of room and the beds were comfortable. We would definitely stay here again if we go skiing, as they are right across from Greek Peak. We had a great stay, thanks Bart!"

The house was perfect for our group of 6 adults and 4 young adults . Kitchen had space for several cooks to create and was clean and very well equipped. Baths and bedrooms were clean and beds comfy and cozy. The home has some very nice features that would be great in warmer weather like a huge deck and enclosed porch. We had a great stay here and look forward to retuning next year."

The ambiance of the fireplace and comfortable accommodations provided the perfect retreat after a long day on the slopes. The proximity to the ski slopes was a game-changer, allowing for easy access to the snowy adventures.
Bart and Julie, the hosts, were quick to respond to each inquiry.

The town itself does not have eating options but Ithaca is about 30-35 mins away, so we planned accordingly. Bart and Julia are extremely responsive and it was very easy to communicate with them.

Stayed a few nights","Wonderful stay at this cute place in Cortland! Olena was a great host and very responsive. Her place is clean, updated and comfy. The beds are comfortable - one Queen and one twin daybed.
The house has a nice dining table which served as a game table when we were not eating. Comfortable living room and a bright side room with lots of natural light for reading a book.
Washer and dryer in basement if you need.
Do note - there is no TV so bring a laptop if you desire to watch a movie at night. WiFi was easy access and good.
Would happily stay here again."

Stayed with kids","Olena’s place was perfect for us! We were 3 adults and 1 infant. We attended a wedding at Greek peak and the location of the house was perfect. The pictures don’t do the house justice it’s really a beautiful space. It was extremely clean, modern touches all throughout the house and host was very friendly and accommodating. Check in was with the co-host and she was waiting for us upon arrival to show us the house and answer any questions. Highly recommend Olena’s place. I’m sure she will be a super host very soon. We will be back if we find ourselves in Cortland again!"

Stayed with kids","Shelley's home is a gem! The upstairs has a quintessential log cabin feeling, with beautiful furniture and little touches like lots of cozy blankets to curl up and enjoy the stunning views over Greek Peak. And our kids had a blast in the downstairs area, with all sorts of beds, the huge sectional couch and lots of games. They played for hours and hours down there.
The house is also extremely well equipped for renters, ranging from basic supplies to a large griddle for making hearty pancake breakfasts ahead of a day on the mountain!
We would love to book Shelley's home again."

We enjoyed hiking in the trails on the state forest land abutting the property. The kids loved sledding in the yard. Shelley was promptly responsive to all our questions.

Group trip","We came down with 11 adults and 3 children and everyone had plenty of room, the house is bigger then the pictures make it feel. We primarily came down to do hiking in the finger lake / Ithaca region and we were about 30 min away which was very doable. We went to downtown Cortland as well and had a great lunch at the Brix restaurant and some brews at the brewery. There is a walmart super center 12 min away and the kitchen is very well stocked with appliances, cooking utensils, spices, and plenty fridge space, coffee machine, also an outdoor grill for additional cooking. We appreciated how clean the house was and that everything provided was in working condition including TVs, pac man machine, and even provided outdoor fire pit with firewood. The kids really enjoyed the ski resorts adventure center where we did zip lining and the mountain roller coaster. We also had lunch at the Trax pub and grill and it was phenomenal food and beers on tap. Overall, the house is beautiful, cozy and well stocked, clean, location is a close drive for hiking, restaurants, and literally two min away from the ski resort that also has an indoor water park. I would highly recommend this home year round. The check in/out process was very easy and parking was ample on the driveway. Do not hesitate to book this home it’s seriously everything you need at an affordable price. Thank you we will definitely be coming back in the winter."

Ithaca and the Finger Lakes were within about an hours drive where we spent our weekend hiking and enjoying the wineries in the area. It would be nice to spend some time there during the winter as the house has beautiful views of the ski slopes.

Group trip","The house is clean, homey, spacious and lovely. There were so many amenities that we made good use of (including an old style pacman game machine on the bottom floor, board games and giant, lovely TVs). The house was beautiful wood and tile, there were so many welcoming, homey touches to the environment such as posters and wall decorations. The electronics and appliances were all in perfect working order, and the hostess was amazing at getting back to me through text whenever I had a question. There was plenty of space for 7 people to lounge and relax after a day of hiking and walking. I adored the view from the windows (green as far as the eye can see!) and the covers, blankets, and mattresses were all in perfect condition. The bottom beds in the 2 bunk beds were full beds and comfortably fit 2 people so we never even had to use the top bunks. The house has amazing central AC/heating systems. The kitchen was easily my favorite, with a beautiful spacious island and a stove top (if you press the button on the top right, you get a small vent that pops up!) and wood accented fridge/freezer with plenty of room, SO much cabinet space and a well kept sink. The washer/dryer's were also in great working condition, and much appreciated as there was a sudden downpour on one of the bikes we went on. I have never been so impressed by the condition of an airbnb stay before. You won't regret booking here!"

Stayed with kids","This is a beautiful, spacious, and well-stacked home. I imagine it is a beautiful place to stay in the winter (the decor is very snowman-heavy :)). Our trip was in the summer during what I assume was a pretty unusual heat wave! Do note that there is no air conditioning in the home. This is clearly listed in the ad, so we knew ahead of time. Luckily for us, the basement area stays decently cool.
Overall, the host was responsive to our queries. I believe she was on vacation during our stay and still managed to respond to most requests in a reasonably timeframe.
The house was better stocked than most rentals I've been to, with plenty of paper products, linens, hand soap, detergent, etc. Excellent. The kitchen utensils were great as well.
The place was spotless/clean.
Thanks so much!"

The kitchen/dining area is small but functional and well equipped - be aware there is no oven, just two hot plates and a microwave. We had 3 cars between 3 adults, which was a bit tight for parking but we managed to not obstruct access. Sleeping in complete darkness (no streetlights) was wonderful, we all slept really well.
Nicely situated for Cortland and Ithaca, the Finger Lakes, Syracuse. The host was very pleasant and responsive."

The only reason that I rated it 4 stars, instead of 5, was that some of the kitchen staples that were advertised, (ie. Cooking oil & coffee), weren’t available. (Note: Julie wasn’t aware of this so she is now planning to restock.). I would definitely stay here again; and, I will recommend it to others."

It's super cozy--reminds me of staying in my grandparents' home. The grounds are lush with hostas, beautiful trees, hydrangeas, and lots of flowering shrubs. Both bedrooms have lovely views and AC units (we didn't even need them in May!), the living room is a great size to relax and has 2 nice sofas. The bathroom is new and has double sinks. I now want cool Bali blinds on my own bedroom windows like Julie's! Everything was very clean. Julie left a few snacks in the kitchen. There were essentials in the bathroom (e.g., shampoo, body wash, soap, lotion, a hairdryer) and the kitchen (e.g., coffee, filters, creamers). Don't hesitate to stay here--it's such a relaxing, lovey place. Thank you, Julie!"

The noise from preparing breakfast did not carry to the bedrooms so the kids could sleep in a little. We headed to Greek Peak 2 of the days and it was a short 12 minute drive. The kitchen had plenty of dishes for our simple meals, perfect for 4 people. The couches were comfortable and we were able to sign into Amazon with no problem to relax and watch a movie.

Very nice living room area and comfortable bedrooms equipped with A/C units for summer nights. The table and chairs on the front patio was a favorite spot for us to sit outside and look at the starry night - you can see the stars very well! Super convenient location close to Cortland and the Finger Lakes / state parks, yet also a very quiet and rural setting. Plenty of thoughtful touches throughout the unit including board games, coffee/tea, Chewy snack bars, and more."

Julie was always available to answer any questions. The bedrooms were behind a hallway with a door, so we didn't have to tiptoe around while the baby was napping. The house was spotlessly clean and had great energy. Decor was quite pleasant. Julie was nice enough to supply a crib, bouncer and high chair for the baby. Dogs were permitted, which is truly a rare find, especially in someplace so spotlessly clean. There was really nothing negative. It was all good. Beats a hotel room any day! Thank you Julie!"

Wonderful collection of shampoos, soaps and lotions. Two bedrooms, large living room with TV, two couches, and a table top with four stools, provide excellent space for a family of four (or more). No kitchen, but small fridge and new coffee pot were all we needed. Appreciated the coffee, creamers, and granola bars left for our use. Very close to Cornell if headed that direction - no more than 20 minutes to campus. Very easy check-in, great communication with host. Will stay here again!"

Stayed a few nights","We had a super comfortable weekend here. Check-in was very convenient... all we needed was a code to unlock the door. That worked out great because we arrived very late and did not have to worry about meeting someone for a key. The space was set up very well with a table and ""kitchenette"" area attached to living room, then one bedroom with double bed, another bedroom with two single beds and double sink bathroom. The entire place was very clean. All of the extra touches were particularly pleasing: fresh ground coffee and creamer in fridge, snack bars, and just about any toiletry you may have forgotten! The bedrooms were very warm, though we had a bit of difficulty figuring out how to increase the temperature in the living room. We bumped up the thermostat, but it seemed to take a while to respond. It wasn't a problem, really, because there were many cozy blankets around! Julie left her phone number for any issues, but we never had any need to contact her during our stay. The location is convenient to both Cortland (10 minutes) and Ithaca (30 minutes). It was way better than staying in a hotel!"

She thought of everything we could possible need and provided it having the home all set up and ready for our arrival. Her home is very clean and well taken care of.
I enjoyed the bowed out shower curtain rod in the bathroom allowing for the shower to be a bit more spacious. The counter space in the bathroom was also a plus.
The location is pretty perfect. There's free parking at the house and It's a quite and beautiful neighborhood, but also just a quick drive away to restaurants, WalMart, and much more.
Julie has quite a few games that we enjoyed along with a bucket full of toys for any little ones you may bring along or have visit while you stay.
Check in and check out are super simple and flexible on times.

My group and I arrived in the middle of a snowstorm after a 6 hour drive, and Julie, Mike, and Betty were there to greet us. Mike was shoveling for when we arrived even though it was around 8 PM!
We went in to find everything that you could possibly need for a weekend getaway. From a mini-fridge and microwave with snacks to towels and extra blankets in the rooms, the entire space was beautifully decorated and attention to detail was evident throughout. You can see how much thought and care Julie and Mike have put into their property!
I would highly recommend anyone looking for a place to stay in the area, whether to ski/snowboard at Greek Peak (we were there for a spartan race on the ski resort) which is only about a five minute drive or looking for a weekend getaway, to consider staying here as our hosts were great, the space was great, and hanging out with Betty the dog was just an added bonus.
We would definitely stay here again !!"

We had plenty of space, wonderful finishing touches, and quick & easy access to Greek Peak, and the Fingerlake wineries, which is the reason for going in this direction. We came from Philadelphia Pennsylvania, and the ride was real simple and direct. I’m already working on my calendar to go back in the fall. Thank you Julie, Mike, and especially Betty for all of your hospitality."

Stayed a few nights",We stayed here with two teenagers while visiting local colleges in the area. The Airbnb is just as described and seen in pictures and it was easy to get to all of the nearby schools we were visiting. The space is spacious enough to easily and comfortably fit for four people. My favorite part was the bed. I haven't been that cozy or comfortable in a while! The place was very homey and a great place to rest after a long day. Highly recommend!

Stayed a few nights","The property initially presents itself as charming but is poorly constructed and disorganized. While the front door boasts a convenient keypad, the lack of privacy features like shades or curtains is noticeable. Inside, the DIY closet and makeshift doorframe in the living room contribute to an unstable and unappealing environment. The ""bed"" is makeshift and uncomfortable, requiring a search for outlets. Decor choices, including black walls and neon signs, feel out of place and contribute to a dirty atmosphere. The kitchen is in need of a thorough cleaning, with evidence of a pest problem found on the stove and in the sink. The bathroom's large shower head is a positive feature, but the smaller shower head is impractically attached to the wall. Additionally, the use of black towels detracts from the feeling of cleanliness. Outside, the overgrown grass adds to the property's unkempt appearance. Overall, the experience is disappointing, and the property requires significant renovations."

Stayed a few nights","We loved our stay. 5 min walk to main lift. Can see people skiing from living room. We drove over just to take breaks/ have a snack in our car at times… but also loved Trax Pub (solid beers, best mac and Cheese I’ve ever had- brisket was in it). LOVED the variety of trails PS… I am a new skier this season and loved the glades or tree runs.
Jennifer was so responsive and helpful if we needed anything but chances are you won’t need much- she has everything (I.e even a crock pot- I should have checked because we brought our own ha).
Only time we needed her was regarding an unplowed drive way to get into parking lot (we have a smaller car)… this was right as a snow storm was getting going but Jennifer called management of the place to be plowed. It turned out totally fine!
The design of the place is gorgeous- modern while still being cozy and so many creative storage options to make it feel open. I felt like it was my place within 30 minutes and wished we could have stayed longer."

Stayed a few nights","The photos don’t do the space justice - it’s wonderfully renovated, extremely comfortable and could only be more convenient if we were sleeping in the lodge. We will absolutely be booking this place again on a return trip"

Stayed a few nights","Such a beautifully remodeled condo! Jennifer thought of everything and was very responsive. We were able to walk to the base of the mountain for skiing, but could also catch the shuttle back and forth. We'll definitely be back!"

Stayed with kids","Hands down one of our favorite rentals. They thought of everything, I don’t have enough great things to say! My 11 year old daughter and her best friend thought it was the “best places they have ever been”. We were honestly walking distance to the mountain, easy access to the lodge’s amenities, and perfectly fine for sitting in by the fireplace. I never had Greek peek on my radar before, but I am telling you I would come back here just to be able to stay here again! If you are on the fence I’m telling you if you have a small group or couples trip, this is the place"
