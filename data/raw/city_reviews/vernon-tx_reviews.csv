Stayed a few nights",We have stayed at multiples of Anthony's places and they are all just as adorable as the next. This place is small but perfect for a short stay for singles or a couple. We can't wait for our next reason to stay in the area!

Stayed about a week","Excellent rental unit. Well appointed. Washer, dryer and laundry supplies were available right inside the unit and free of cost. That's very rare for a small cottage of this size. Although the unit is within a small RV park, no problems whatsoever from other residents. Very quiet. Small town. Town center is somewhat rundown but probably being reconstructed. Nearby towns and cities like Iowa Park, Wichita Falls have very beautiful parks which I highly recommend. Communication from the host was efficient and prompt. I recommend this rental unit."

Stayed with a pet","Anthony’s Cottage was the perfect spot to rest after a long day on the road. It was quick off the interstate and easy to find, keyless door code check in, cold AC, and spotless. It's so much more relaxing than checking into a hotel. Anthony really thought out the space, it felt very spacious and had a kitchenette with coffee and tea. Full bathroom with shower and a washer/dryer! All were much appreciated! We enjoyed our stay and wish we had more time there. If it's available, end your search and stay here!"

Only issues were the dryer is older so it took a couple times to fully dry clothes and the view is meh but regardless was an amazing time. A lot of accommodations and a gracious host who helped us out multiple times without issue. Couldn’t have asked for a better place. Beautiful cottage with practically everything you’d need. Overall phenomenal stay! 10000/10

This is tiny home like living at a campsite setting. Just off of the freeway in a small town made it easy to find and convenient to get back to the freeway and on our way.

Stayed one night","Cute tiny home. We stayed one night. Was a little difficult to find. It was out in “no man’s” land. The address wasn’t on the home that matches the listing. It had all the amenities listed. We loved the washer and dryer. Sitting on the front porch on rocking chairs at sunset was the highlight. Host was very responsive.
Might bring your own towels. The ones provided were just bigger than hand towels. Place was very clean. Lots of traffic in the morning. You are literally next to the road. Overall, it wasn’t the best we’ve stayed in but definitely not the worst. This was our 21st."

Washer dryer mini fridge and all the utensils you could need! Most importantly a wine bottle opener lol! Now if your traveling for work keep in mind there is a train I only heard it once, it’s off a somewhat busy road just close your blinds but it settles down after 6, you may even hear some coyotes but hey that’s the country for you! With that said I will definitely be staying again! He was quick to respond check in was easy and when I didn’t understand my alarm system he gave a girl a hand! Just absolutely amazing service!"

Stayed one night","Oh my goodness! This Airbnb was fantastic. We've stayed in a lot of airbnb's but this one stands out in superiority! Very organized space - not huge, but had everything we needed and things we didn't. I've seen much bigger spaces that didn't have everything this airbnb had. Anthony was very easy to communicate with and allowed us to check in early as we had been traveling since 3 am. Electra had a couple of good places to eat as a bonus. I wish we could have stayed longer than a night. I can see this being a great place for someone to live as a traveling nurse, etc. We plan to try to stay here again on other out of town trips up this direction. It was easy to get to and close to the road. Electra is not a big town and there was virtually no traffic on the road. Bed was comfortable and linens were great. I want to be able to stay here again so don't tell your friends! LOL!!!"

Stayed a few nights","This was a perfect and relaxing stay! I was visiting my daughter and new grandson who lives nearby. The place was very clean and well furnished with everything you need. Just fyi there is occasionally some road nose from trucks (near hwy business road) but it is not bad and pretty much ends by bedtime. I only noticed it a couple of times. The location, privacy, roominess, and amenities far outweigh any noise. I will definitely stay here again. It was cool to see the transformation of these tiny cabins and how efficient and well everything fits. The WiFi was great and with the Hulu tv I was able to enjoy my downtime and get work done. There is a dispenser in the shower with shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. I do feel the owners went above and beyond to make the cabin nice and comfortable. If you are visiting or passing through definitely give these a try!"

The all-fenced yard outside was extremely handy and our two little boston terriers accepted it immediately, rolled in the nice grass, did their thing and then came back inside with us....until the next time , when we saw them waiting at the back door.
We loved our stay, slept soundly on the clean, comfortable bed and wished we could have stayed longer.
We highly recommend Anthony's place !"

The bed was comfy and we enjoyed the fan and AC. The house was a cute theme and had spacious rooms. I particularly appreciated that the host only requested we tidy up the towels, but leave the rest. We didn’t make a mess, but I appreciate checkout was low maintenance!"

Host was also very flexible with our late arrival and helped with sleeping arrangements for our infant son. He LOVED the chicken decorations! We’ll definitely be back!"

The house had many extras that we weren’t expecting. Great selection of coffee, other hot drinks, bottled water, treats in the cute cookie jar, shampoos, soaps. Nice little extras. Very cute little place and it was perfect for our needs."

It was a chilly night and took a bit to warm up once we got there but had plenty of blankets to stay warm. The train woke us up a few times but we knew that from previous reviews so not a big deal. Our pups loved the big yard and we had everything we needed for our short stay.

Unrelated to the AirBnB and it’s host, I advise caution traveling down the roads in the area- take it slow, and you should be fine. There are a few really bad bumps in the road- though that’s a problem the city itself will gads to fix."

Everything looked new and tidy and smelled good. We felt right at home, and our kids and I loved all the chicken-themed decor. I particularly appreciated the bright and clean bathroom (including a clean shower curtain), a real stove to cook on, a real fridge, the supportive bed, easy-to-operate TV and AC units, and all the thoughtful touches to welcome us, including things for the kids. This place, set in a sleepy quaint town, was the perfect place to stop between Houston and Boulder on our road trip."

Stayed with a pet","Our first time staying at Airbnb, we will definitely be staying with John & Meredith again. We have family in Vernon.
The house was perfectly cleaned. The deco was adorable. I got a few great ideas while we were there.
The only part of our stay we would had made changes to is the living room tv. Because we’re old and just don’t understand technology as well 😆 we couldn’t get the living room tv to pair with our phones."

The kitchen is well stocked with any cooking essentials you may need (like good knives and pans), the bathroom linens are plush, and showers hot!
We loved walking to get shave ice and the convince of several locally owned restaurants was super great! Would definitely stay here again and recommend to you!"

Sheila went above and beyond, last minute to get me in as soon as possible. She was such a blessing to our family. The house is beautiful and spacious! Very clean! Backyard and patio is huge. Kids had a blast playing basketball and running around the backyard. Thank you again, Sheila! I will definitely be back to stay at your beautiful, cozy home!"

Stayed a few nights","Wow. Sheila is incredibly responsive & gracious. Her craftsman home has charming original details & is comfortable in every way. AC, 3 big bedrooms (one w/ a king bed) and an additional half bath. The beds were COMFORTABLE with fluffy pillows. A wonderful rocking chair front porch, a back porch with a grill by the garden & easy parking. The kitchen was exceptionally well equipped with everything needed to cook at home. It’s on the main road but still very quiet; an easy stroll to groceries and quaint shops. Having a 24-hour convenience store so close by was nice. Originally, we were to be staying in Vernon, TX but our place got double booked (only discovered after flying across the country and were headed there in our rental car). Everything around there was booked and we were in a pickle. We messaged Shelia. She was prompt to accommodate our needs and even left us some cookies! Well worth the 30 minute drive from Vernon to have such a rejuvenating place to gather & unwind."

There were a lot of dead crickets throughout the space, but at least they were dead:) Also, the towels and wash cloths in the bathroom could have been upgraded. They seemed a bit old and had a soured smell when wet. Overall it was a great space to meet half way for a weekend away. Austin was very friendly and quick to respond!"

The room was spacious with more amenities than usual. I was able to do my laundry and cook a meal while there. It was very cozy and relaxing, especially after a busy week. I highly recommend this place and will definitely stay here again the next time I have to come back. I couldn’t imagine staying at a better place for that price. Austin was quick to respond with any questions that I had or to resolve any issues. Can’t wait to come back!!!"

Stayed with kids","We needed a 3 bedroom rental close to Thalia, Crowell and Archer City, for a family reunion and related events. This apartment was perfect for our needs and was exactly as it appeared and described in the listing. It was clean, well-appointed, roomy and comfortable. Amber was very responsive and helpful throughout the rental process. The listing mentioned the area may be noisy and we experienced some of that. One of the buildings tenants apparently left early for work several mornings and slammed a lot of doors and noisily loaded a pickup truck. Obviously, Amber can't control the actions of other building tenants, so no fault on her part. The apartment suited our needs and was certainly more economical and roomy than a hotel. The next reunion is 2 years away and I would certainly rent this apartment again."

Group trip","great location downtown Vernon. large space, good amenities, nice decor. i only wish it was more equipped with basic amenities such as toilet papers and paper towels because limited quantity were provided for a week’s stay so we ran out after two days. and it might be helpful to put some paddings between the cabinets because it’s very loud when it’s shut and noise travels loudly within the townhouse. overall would definitely recommend this place and come back to stay. Amber is communicative and answers questions promptly."

I was dropping my son off to Vernon College and this was extremely convenient by rental car. I got take out from a Thai spot just minutes down the road and the food was delicious. There is not a lot to do in downtown Vernon that I could see so I’d definitely recommend a rental or having transportation depending on the reason for your stay. Amber was a delight and so helpful during my stay as well. I look forward to returning for baseball season! Thanks Amber!"

One thing to note it is an older house so it was very squeaky (just something to keep in mind if traveling with a light sleeper infant). There’s also a train nearby and while I absolutely love the sound of train and it didn’t bother us, it is something I wanted to note for others. We really took comfort in the alarm system, it was definitely reassuring. The place was clean and extremely well stocked, especially the kitchen. I highly recommend this airbnb to others and we look forward to staying again in the future."

We had absolutely everything you need to cook & even more! We truly enjoyed the board games they had & the puzzle book. The fire pit in the back was our absolute favorite specially during these nice and cool fall nights.

I could hear a train from time to time, but I love trains so that only added to the dreamy quality of the space.

It took a while to fix and then took over 5 hours to cool the house under 80 degrees. The host extended apologies, but nothing more. One night stay was spent sweating and fighting kids to sleep.
So as long as the AC stays strong I recommend this house."

She got so many ideas, I will spend the summer making our house like yours!!! She has been on the fence about what material to use for our back splash in our kitchen, after seeing your mini subway tile she wants that. So looks like I am going to be tileing this summer! Seriously you have a great clean spot and really appreciate you!!"

There is a large backyard, which my dog enjoyed. However, if you come with dogs you need to be aware of coyotes in that area. We saw a couple of them trying to chase our dog. Just be careful. Besides that, we felt safe."

Stayed a few nights","My stay at Jasons/Bettys Bungalow ( youll need to rent to find out why Bettys Bungalow) was simply perfect, restful, quaint and ohh so comfortable.
The place is updated but yet enough of the originality was perfect.
It had everything I could possibly need.
The towels were fluffy soft, the sheets were nice, the sofa was comfy.
All very inviting
The price was very fair as well"

Stayed a few nights","This is an adorable house. It was very neat & tidy, beautifully decorated, & lots of space. It is in a great location close to downtown. It was in a quiet area even with a playground across the street, once inside you could not hear the children playing. Big plus was it was pet friendly. It has a fenced backyard with a privacy fence. It was home away home. We would definitely stay there again."

Stayed a few nights",It’s a cozy little cottage just a few blocks from downtown Vernon. It’s easy to get to the highway and there’s plenty of good restaurants in the area. Wichita Falls is about 45 minutes away so a nice drive but not too far if you want to explore the area more! The house is perfect and the host is very friendly and attentive to all your needs! I’ll definitely be staying here again!

Stayed with kids",It was so quiet on the street. The decor was so cute the bed was comfortable and the one issue I did have when I reached out for help he answered very quickly to solve the problem. It was a tv issue where all I needed to do was unplug and replug and it came on in a snap!! The house is just so quaint and cozy I couldn’t b happier

Stayed with a pet","Things to expect here
•clean and flnicely furnished house
•a very nice bathroom and bedroom
•a quiet and peaceful neighborhood
•the washer and dryer were nice touch
•quick or immediate responses from the hosts.
if you're traveling as a duo group or couple then it's just as cheap as the shitty hotels here and way nicer. definitely a good spot to stay over night on a trip or a week or two on a work stay."
